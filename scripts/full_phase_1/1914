Positive 1914 pIs it possible to call a 64bit MSI installer from a 32bit MSI installer We have 32bit product installer but a few components are 64bit e.g. Windows Shell Extension Handlers and we want to install these along with our applications. Any ideas on how this can be done Via MSM or Custom Actions or MSI Chaining We are using InstallShield.p
Positive 1914 pIm having a hard time understanding how to properly install and uninstall custom actions, and what the purpose of rollback is. I have a custom action called codeCreateFSRegistryLinkcode that creates a codeREGLINKcode registry entry which cannot be created by MSIInstallShield directly AFAIK. I think I have this running properly for the most part because if the link is already there, it just returns codeERRORFUNCTIONNOTCALLEDcode, which MSI seems to handle gracefully, proceeding with the rest of the install. This ensures that multiple instances of the product can be installed cleanly we have a multiinstance product.p  pThe problem comes during uninstall. codeCreateFSRegistryLinkcode appears to be running again in nonrollback mode. From the MSI log I can see that its running as it should during an eminstallem and but it also runs during an emuninstallemp  pIm checking the mode withp  precodeif MsiGetModehInstall, MSIRUNMODEROLLBACK codepre  pWhen the condition is true I log a message, CreateFSRegistryLink is running in nonrollback mode. When it is false, I log a message, CreateFSRegistryLink is running in rollback mode, so was skipped. I have never seen the second message show up in the log.p  pI have codeCreateFSRegistryLinkcode set up with InScript execution of Deferred Execution in System Context. I also have another custom action codeDeleteFSRegistryLinkcode set up with InScript execution of Rollback Execution in System Context. I see it getting skipped during an install, but not during an uninstall I suspect its running normally during an uninstall, but have not added logging to confirm this.p  pI also have a custom action codeCountOtherFSSystemscode that sets FSSystemCount to the number of systems instances besides the current instance. I set codeDeleteFSRegisryLinkcode to have a condition to only run when codeFSSystemCountlt1code in the Exec sequence. This is how I can tell that it is being skipped during an install because MSI reports that the condition wasnt met and so codeDeleteFSRegistryLinkcode was skipped. I expect this to help ensure that it only runs when the last instance is being uninstalled. I think this condition is working based on log output, but I dont know how to get this codeDeleteFSRegistryLinkcode custom action to run properly during uninstall without the codeCreateFSRegistryLinkcode action reinstalling the link. The last reference to codeDeleteFSRegistryLinkcode I see in the log isp  precodeMSI s 08CC [094223708] Executing op CustomActionScheduleActionDeleteFSRegistryLink,ActionType3329,SourceBinaryData,TargetDeleteFSRegistryLink, codepre  pI havent added logging to this function yet, so I dont know if it ran, but when the uninstall is done, the link in the registry is still there.

Weve already implemented  for the project  we specified  since were automating the build process and dont want developers to have to change it manually every time p  pHowever, were binding the SVN revision to the 4th number in version  like this  [ 1.0.0.SVNRevision ] so every SVN build create a minor upgrade that cause various problem to our installationp  pSo, do we have a way to manage those minor upgrade without messing with the already implemented major upgrade some way to just disable the installation if it is a minor upgrade would be simple and nice Thanksp

Positive 1914 pI am new to both Wix and WixSharp. I recently learnt Wix and created a basic installer with it. One of the properties I used was IniFileSearch which helped me search a value from an IniFile and use that to find an install location for my files. I am trying to do the same using WixSharp but dont seem to find an equivalent method. The closest thing I could find in WixSharp is the AppSearch class under WixSharp.CommonTasks.  From Wix I know that AppSearch is a MSI database table where search tasks are stored. IniFileSearch is one of those searches. I am not even sure if the AppSearch class in WixSharp library is directly mapped to the AppSearch MSI database table.  Anyways, my goal is to find the IniFileSearch equivalent method in WixSharp Library. If anybody knows it, an example would be great.p  pHere is a sample IniFileSearch in Wix markupp  precodeltProperty IdMYPROPERTYgt  ltIniFileSearch IdmyIniSearch                 NamemyConfigFile.ini                 Sectionsection1                 Keyname                 Typeraw gt ltPropertygt codepre
Positive 1914 pWe have been working on rebuilding our installer with WIX and Burn, using a custom bootstrapper application.  We are using a feature tree in our main MSI, and have set EnableFeatureSelectionyes so that we can replicate the feature tree in our custom BA UI and send those feature selections down to the MSI at planapply time.  This has all been working well until we started recently to test the upgrade process.  We have run into what appears to be an open bug in Burnp  pa hrefhttpwixtoolset.orgissues4616 relnofollowhttpwixtoolset.orgissues4616ap  pWhen we do a minor upgrade, the features that are already installed do not get upgraded...the originally installed code remains on the machine.  From the testing and investigation weve done, we believe its because Burn isnt passing REINSTALLALL to the MSI package which is what the above bug says.p  pWe found this question where Rob says you have to handle the OnPlanMsiFeature callback, which we are doing correctly.p  pa hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions15394382wixpassoptiontomsiforrepairwix pass option to msi for repairap  pSince the above bug has been open since Dec 2014, we didnt have confidence that it would be fixed soon, so we decided that we would try to find a workaround.  What weve come up with so far is hackish at best, but at a proof of concept level, it shows some promise.  We are copying the entire MsiPackage node, giving the copy a new ID and adding a property with REINSTALLALL on it, like thisp  precode  ltMsiPackage  IdMSI     Cacheyes     Compressedno     DisplayInternalUIno     Vitalyes     Visibleyes     EnableFeatureSelectionyes     SourceFileltpath to MSIgtgt   ltMsiPackagegt     ltMsiPackage  IdMSIREINSTALL     Cacheyes     Compressedno     DisplayInternalUIno     Vitalyes     Visibleyes     EnableFeatureSelectionyes     SourceFileltpath to MSIgtgt      ltMsiProperty NameREINSTALL ValueALLgt   ltMsiPackagegt codepre  pThen, in our custom BA, we are using the DetectRelatedMsiPackage event to detect a minor upgrade.  And using that minor upgrade detection to set the RequestState for each MsiPackage to either Local or None inside our PlanPackageBegin event handler, like thisp  precode            if e.PackageId  MSI                              if Operation  RelatedOperation.MinorUpdate                                      e.State  RequestState.None                                  else                                      e.State  RequestState.Present                                            if e.PackageId  MSIREINSTALL                              if Operation  RelatedOperation.MinorUpdate                                      e.State  RequestState.Present                                  else                                      e.State  RequestState.None                               codepre  pWere hoping to have some guidance from others who have run into this error with upgrades in Burn with EnableFeatureSelection turned on.  Will our workaround do the job  Alternatively, is there a way to dynamically create an MsiProperty from the custom BA so we can create REINSTALLALL as needed  Does anyone have other ideas of how to workaround this issue that are cleaner andor more reliable  p  pIf you need more information, let me know.  Weve been working with WixBurn for a couple months now, so we know some things...but were not experts yet.  p

Positive 1914 pI am working on a problem in WIX where the outcome of a custom action needs to dictate whether the next custom action will run. Is this possible A script will be run on the installing machine that will query the running processes to find out if it is on the special machine. The outcome of this script needs to be used to decide if the next custom action should be run.p  pI have found a hrefhttpsmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibrarywindowsdesktopaa36801228vvs.8529.aspx relnofollowthis gema which shows that there is quite a bit of control when it comes to deciding to run a custom action, but there is still the issue of actually getting a relevant value set.p  pA lastresort solution I have thought of is to have the initial custom action use setx to set an environment variable, but this will leave behind the residual environment variable used to control the flow of the installer. A postinstaller can be used to clean that up as well, but it just keeps getting uglier and uglier.p

Positive 1914 pThank you in advance for considering this question. If a similar question existed, I was unable to find it. p  pThe Issue Our company packages an application into an MSI. This MSI when installed outside of any GPO properly updates, blocks attempts to downgrade or move from a higher revision to a lower revision, and never has trouble uninstalling previous versions of the application regardless of how long ago those versions were createdinstalled. For example, we can install version 1.2.3 and then install version 2.3.4 and the application will properly install without issue. However, we work with a customer who uses GPO to deploy our application to hundreds of PCs. Each time we have provided an updated version of the application the following has been indicatedp  pOn any machine where a previous version of our application was installed via GPO, no matter what the previous version is, the update successfully installs without issue.p  pOn a machine where the application was manually installed outside of the GPO, and an attempt to update the application via GPO is made  either the application is installed in addition to the old version, OR there remain registry keys to the previous version of the application and the application cannot openrun correctly. In this case the registry keys must be manually removed, and the install is then attempted again from a clean machine. p  pWhat we know is that on any machine where the application was originally installed via GPO  updating the application is no problem. On every machine where the application was not installed with the GPO in the first place, updating via GPO fails with one of the problems presented above. p  pMy question is Is there a technical issue with how the installation is being handled partially through the GPO and partially outside Does the GPO need to be responsible for the entire lifecycle of the application OR is it a reasonable expectation that the application be updated both on machines where the original version was manually outside the GPO  installed, and when it was installed initially from within the GPO p  pOne solution we are aware of is simply having all computers manage the application lifecycle since we know updates work in that environment already, however this would mean that many computers would need to have the manually installed versions removed by hand  and then properly handle the installation through GPO which is an extensive bit of work. p  pWe would greatly welcome any solutions, references to technical documentation that formally shed light on the proper management or expectations here, or links to information. Our research suggests that it is best to manage the entire applications lifecycle inside the GPO  but I have as of yet been unable to determine that it is 100 necessary to do so. p  pLooking forward to any assistance. If any further technical details are required to help the viability of the question, please dont hesitate to request such details.p

Positive 1914 pI have been working on a project where I need to install a Java service running as a spring boot application from a Wix installer for Windows.  It should autodetect if there is already a JRE instance installed globally on the system, and if so, use it, otherwise, install a private JRE for this application.

The new assembly version can be provided by a new component or by the same component that provides the old version.p      pIf your update changes the strong name of the assembly, the MsiPatchOldAssemblyFile table and MsiPatchOldAssemblyName table are required if the patch package does not have a MsiPatchSequence table. The MsiPatchOldAssemblyFile table and MsiPatchOldAssemblyName table are not required if the patch package has patch sequencing information in a MsiPatchSequence table.p blockquote  pI recognized that the tables a hrefhttpsmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibrarywindowsdesktopaa37006228vvs.8529.aspx relnofollowMsiAssemblyNamea, a hrefhttpsmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibrarywindowsdesktopaa37034628vvs.8529.aspx relnofollowMsiPatchOldAssemblyNamea and a hrefhttpsmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibrarywindowsdesktopaa37034528vvs.8529.aspx relnofollowMsiPatchOldAssemblyFilea were not built in Patch 2. So I started to fill these tables according to the documentation. Also I verified that we dont use the table codeMsiPatchSequencecode even in the master setup nor in Patch 1 and 2. In the table MsiAssemblyName I inserted the row which contain the Assembly Version 1.0.0.0 of foo.dll such as the properties name, publicKeyToken and language. p  pAfter that I assert that according to the Build Log of Patch 2, the tables MsiPatchOldAssemblyName and MsiPatchOldAssemblyFile are not built. However the table MsiAssemblyName is built successfully. First I thought that the InstallShield Property a hrefhttphelpnet.installshield.cominstallshield18helplibIHelpPatchGAC.htm relnofollowGenerate MsiPatchOldAssembly tablesa is set to codeNocode but I verified that it is set to codeYescode.p  pLast but not least at the end of the a hrefhttpsmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibrarywindowsdesktopaa37236028vvs.8529.aspx relnofollowWindows Installer Best Practicesa article there is following recommendation for updating an assembly in the global assembly cache.p  blockquote   pAn inplace update overwrites the copy of a .NET Framework Assembly in the global assembly cache. This type of assembly update does not change the strong name of the assembly. Only the value in the FileVersion field of the MsiAssemblyName table is changed.

The class then stores a mapping of token to IClientCallback interface for that token, in a Dictionary.p  pThe method and its class under test looks like the followingp  precodepublic class Router      private IDictionaryltint, IClientCallBackgt clients      public Router              clients  new Dictionaryltint, IClientCallBackgt           public RouterIDictionaryltint, IClientCallBackgt clients              this.clients  clients           public bool Registerint token, IClientCallBack client              if clients.ContainsKeytoken                      clients.Addtoken, client             return true                  return false       codepre  pHow do I test the clients are successfully registered with the Router I figured I can either assume that if the function returned true, it is successful but what is to stop the function body being only return true or I could inject the clients Dictionary into the constructor of the class and in my test I could check that clients.Count equals 1, as per the following.p  precode[TestMethod] public void RegisterTest      IDictionaryltint, IClientCallBackgt clients  new Dictionaryltint, IClientCallBackgt     var router  new Routerclients     var client  new MockltIClientCallBackgt.Object     var success  router.Register4, client     Assert.IsTruesuccess     Assert.AreEqual1, clients.Count     Assert.AreEqualclients[4], client             codepre  pWhile the test above seems good, it seems like overkill to use dependency injection to insert the collection in, just so I can test it.  However it does make testing a lot easier and more accurate when testing other methods of the class too.p  pIs this the recommended way to test this method, or is it overkillp

Negative 1914 pI am working on a project where my teams Flash application is being displayed in another teams WebKit browser.  We are experiencing a bug when a Flash Accordions selected index is changed the webpage itself refreshes.  Since this is a mapbased application, this is unacceptable since the users Area of Interest is lost.p  pFrom my research so far, I understand that Flash uses DeepLinking to set the state of the Flash App based on fragments in the url without actually refreshing the page.  So, a change in the Accordions selected index updates the url, and uses that url to do stuff without actually refreshing the page. p  pSince this is not a problem in any other browser FF,IE,Chrome,Safari, the incompatibility seems to be with the DeepLinking and the WebKit.  Both teams are actively troubleshooting, but time is running out.  Does anyone know of a method to disable the url from changing while still achieving the desired result i.e. the accordion still changes panelsp

Negative 1914 pI am going back to C after spending some time in memorymanaged languages, and Im suddently kinda lost as to what is the best way to implement dependency injection.

Negative 1914 pI have an application with transparent background in client area which is drawn black because the window is not layered. In each of its WMPAINT messages I am doing a BitBlt to a memoryDC, after that I use the memoryDC with UpdateLayeredWindow to a layered canvas window.p  psetup of memoryDCp  precodeHDC hdcMemory  CreateCompatibleDCNULL HBITMAP bmpMemory  CreateDIBSectionhdcMemory, BITMAPINFOampmBitmapInfoHeader, DIBRGBCOLORS, void ampmpDIBSectionBits, NULL, DWORD0 SelectObjecthdcMemory, bmpMemory codepre  pIn WMPAINT I use the BitBlt function to copy the apps client area DC information to the memoryDC. After that Im doing a UpdateLayeredWindow with the memoryDC to a layered canvas windows DC its a CWnd. So its in realtime, and the result is I have the normal application window and a layered window besides with an irregular shape and per pixel transparency.p  pEverything works fine in 32bit desktop color depth If I switch to 16bit, the layered canvas window gets messed up. The drawing looks bad and the whole window is clickthough able.p  pIt think its because of the lack of alpha channel information.p  pSo I googled so much for a solution. I found out that in this situation I have to create the memoryDC withp  precodeHDC hdcMemory  CreateDCTEXTDISPLAY,NULL,NULL,NULL codepre  pinstead of CreateCompatibleDCNULL. Because the compatible DC would give me a 16bit DC.p  pDrawing is better with CreateDC. But the whole window is still clickthroughable and transparency is drawn black in the layered window.p  pSo I think the problem is with BitBlt or the BitmapInfoHeader of CreateDIBSection.p  ol lipI dont know if to use BitmapInfoHeader.biBitCount  32 or BitmapInfoHeader.biBitCount  16 bit. Think its 32. And what about biCompression  BIRGB or BIBITFIELDSpli lipHow to add the alpha channel information to the memoryDC after BitBlt..., SRCCOPY the 16bit DC to the memoryDC, so that it works with UpdateLayeredWindow maybe premultiply the rgb channels with the alpha channel Dunno how to do.pli ol  hr  pI got a little bit closer to the 16bit desktop color depth problem.p  precodeHDC hdcMemory  CreateCompatibleDCNULL codepre  pThe above seems to work. But the result my UpdateLayeredWindow function produces looks messy.p  pSo, this is because the black color is missing Every pixel that was full black gets transparent. You can see through and click though. All other pixel lose their black part und only get click through.p  pI made a test I opened Windows Paint.exe, made a surface of the windows width and height and black as filled color.p  pThen I put it under my layered window with the missing black color, took the layered window as forgeround window again, and tada, my layered window looks normal in combination with the shining through Paint.exe black pixels.p  pSo I expiremented with BitBlt and its rasteroperation parameter again. But no luck.p  pHow can I blend the black color with BitBlt to my DC before drawing with UpdateLayeredWindowp

Type of endDateTimeTimeZone and startDateTimeZone are Integer32 CoreData types. codestartDateTimeZonecode and codeendDateTimeZonecode store number of seconds from GMT of the date codestartDateTimecode and codeendDateTimecode accordingly.p  pThe function simply counts the duration between codestartDateTimecode and codeendDateTimecode. Counting durationValue I also take to the consideration the time zone of the start and end date and adjust the final duration value accordingly. The code counts the duration correctly when run in Debug configuration. When I run it in DistributionRelease the line marked with  has no effect. As an example lets say i have start date as today 100, end date today 200, time zones are the same so that we have the same value in startDateTimeTimeZone7200 sec  0200 and endDateTimeTimeZone7200 sec  0200. When codedurationcode is counted as a timeIntervalBetween dates i get the proper duration valueline marked as 1, in the following line the codedurationcode value is properly substracted but in the  line the duration value is not increased at allp  pHow to fix it I think it might be a problem with compiler optimalizationI use Os or with the type differencesInteger32 and NSTimeInterval.p
Negative 1914 pIve been using Amazon EC2 for hosting a recently released website, mainly to gauge traffic demands etc. before committing to a more dedicated host. Im currently using a small instance of Win2k8SQL and paying about 80month for the service.p  pNow that the site has been up for a month I am considering more longterm VPS solutions. However, Im a bit surprised at costs. I dont see a significant price difference between EC2 and a dedicated VPS usually a 20 difference for a similar level of equipment. Im also a bit concerned, because some of the links posted here for VPS recommendations dont seem to work any more ie. Im confident Amazon will remain next year, but it seems thats not that case for all VPSes.p  pMy questionsp  ol liDoes anyone use EC2 for fulltime, dedicated hosting of a Windows server, and is there any reason not to do so Im specifically noting that EC2 is a cloud provider for ondemand, transient loads, hence my curiosity about its suitability as a dedicated provider.li liAre there any Windows VPSes that are recommended, have been in business for some time and do offer a cost benefit to just running on EC2li ol

Negative 1914 pI dont usually bother with signing my .NET assemblies, so I dont know much beyond the basic mechanics of it. For a small project Im working on, it was necessary to sign, and I created a new key, protected with a password.p  pI expected to be prompted for this password at some point in time when recompiling the assembly, but Ive never needed to enter it anywhere after creating the key file. This seems to defeat the purpose of password protecting the key in the first place.p  pI imagine the password is cached somewhere, but where Is it in some kind of private storage If I give someone else my entire solution directory with the key file in it, will they be prompted for the password I entered, or will they be able to sign the assembly without the passwordp  pThere are lots of articles on the internet about strong name keys and using them, but for some odd reason they all gloss over how the password is actually used by Visual Studio.p  pstrongUpdatestrong Restarting Visual Studio and Windows has no effect, so the caching appears to be persistent. Deleting the .suo file does not change the fact that no password is needed to sign the assembly.p

Negative 1914 pIve always considered JavaScript as a great addition or rather, for the last couple of years, as a must have to the client side of any web application. Even when I started to use Mootools, which takes a big step away from DOM manipulation, and aims toward a general purpose, OO framework, I still didnt think that I would consider using JavaScript for serverside development. JavaScript belongs to the front, period  thats what I thought.p  pWell, it seems like a hrefhttpwww.platforms.orgteams2011according to some damn smart peoplea, I was wrong. For the first time ever, the web development platform contest called PlatForm accepted a team that used pure JavaScript strongbothstrong on the server and the client side. Whats more, here is what the contest organizers had to say about thisp  pemWe had a single application of a team, Upstream Agile, that will work with JavaScript on both the server and the client side. Since this might become a major trend in coming years, we consider their participation a glimpse of the future and accept this team even though no others with this platform have applied.emp  pSo my question is is this really a viable concept, to build multitier web applications purely on JavaScript If so, what would be the advantages of using JavaScript for both the front and the backendp  pstrongEDITstrong The link in Vanwarils answer a hrefhttpchetansurpur.comblog201010whynodejsistotallyawesome.htmlWhy node.js is totally awesomea reveals an interesting discussion in the comments section that worth reading through. I, for one, have decided that though using Javascript on the server side is a viable concept and might have its benefits, I would definitely not start building an enterprise application with that architecture. At least for now. This question might need to be asked again in a year, I can imagine that the answer will dramatically change in the near future.p

Negative 1914 pWe have a large 800 individual projects system that we are migrating from an old build system up to Visual Studio 2010.  Over the last few weeks, we have manually created Visual Studio project files .vcxproj format for each of the projects and we are able to build the entire system from the command line using only MSBuild.exe WIN.  Because of the large number of projects that needed to be converted, it was more efficient to create the project files by hand than to create them using the VS project wizard, since our previous build system was not using Visual Studio project files.p  pFor maintenance and to adhere to DRY, we have the majority of the build configuration compilerlinker switches, include paths, etc. refactored into common .targets and .props files.  Since the set of configurations is the same for every project, we also put the codeltItemGroupgtcode containing the codeltProjectConfigurationgtcode items in the common .props file and everything works fine for our unattended nightly build.p  pUnfortunately, the Visual Studio 2010 IDE RTM version is not able to load these projects.  When I attempt to load the project, I get an error saying Project [Foo] does not contain any configurations.  If I manually copy the codeltItemGroupgtcode from our .props file into any of the projects, the IDE is able to load the project.p  pWhile searching I found a hrefhttpconnect.microsoft.comVisualStudiofeedbackdetails552337allowprojectconfigurationsforvcxprojtobeimported relnofollowthisa issue on MS Connect, but it is marked Closed as External with a reply from MS that the issue is being investigated for the next public release of Visual Studio.  Manually adding the strongexact samestrong codeltItemGroupgtcode element to 800 projects is not an acceptable workaround.  Since the projects build outside of VS and run perfectly, I have to assume that the issue is in the way Visual Studio is parsingloading the project files.p  pHas anyone been able to find a workaround for this issue Does anyone have information about whenif this will be fixed in Visual Studiop

Negative 1914 pI have a somewhat large server process written in .net3.5, that is,  running in a VMWare vCenter Server that keeps crashing without any errors being reported.  The process is created by a Windows Service on 32 bit Windows Server 2003, and is intended to be a long running process multiple days.  It is a collaboration process, that accepts connections via Tcp sockets from multiple clients running on other Windows XP machines, and allows them to share data.  In addition, the process also selfhosts about 8 WCF services that expose a mixture Tcp amp Http endpoints. The process generally consumes about 500 Mb of memory and between 3050 CPU at all times.  There is also an instance of SQL Server 2005 on the same VM that is hosting 6 databases, and consumes about 11.2 Gb of memory.  The entire system has been allocated 8 Gb of ram, and is consuming as much as 7 Gb during normal operation. I assume PAE is enabled to allow the system to address 8 Gb of ram, but have not confirmed this.p  pThe problem is that, at seemingly random times, the process will suddenly crash with no errors being reported, including in the event log.  Ive tried attaching debuggers to the process, and they have not caught the crash either.  I first tried WinDbg on the release build with symbols loaded, then I replaced all of the release dllsexes with debug builds and loaded their symbols.  The crashes still occurred, and the debugger did not catch them.  I next installed Visual Studio on the system with the .Net Reflector addin, and attached that.  It also did not catch the crash.p  pBefore you lecture me on why were running so many things on a single VM, know that I did not design the system, nor did I implement it this way.  Our customer dictated it for specific reasons, and Ive been asked to come in and make it work.  Im only interested in criticisms of the environment if you can site specific evidence that would help explain the sudden crashes.  Our customer may be willing to alter the environment if we can show such evidence.  Any additional debugging techniques that will allow me to capture more information about the crash would be greatly appreciated as well.p
Negative 1914 pIve recently begun using RODBC to connect to PostgreSQL as a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions5651071callingonerinstallationfromanotherI couldnt get RPostgreSQL to compile and run in Windows x64a.  Ive found that read performance is similar between the two packages, but write performance is not.  For example, using RODBC where z is a 6.1M row dataframep  precodelibraryRODBC con lt odbcConnectPostgreSQL84  autoCommitFALSE seems to speed things up odbcSetAutoCommitcon, autoCommit  FALSE system.timesqlSavecon, z, ERASE111, fast  TRUE  user  system elapsed 275.34  369.86 1979.59   odbcEndTrancon, commit  TRUE odbcCloseAll codepre  pWhereas for the same 6.1M row dataframe using RPostgreSQL under 32bitp  precodelibraryRPostgreSQL drv lt dbDriverPostgreSQL con lt dbConnectdrv, dbnamegisdb, userpostgres, password... system.timedbWriteTablecon, ERASE222, z  user  system elapsed  467.57   56.62  668.29   dbDisconnectcon codepre  pSo, in this test, RPostgreSQL is about 3X as fast as RODBC in writing tables.  This performance ratio seems to stay moreorless constant regardless of the number of rows in the dataframe but the number of columns has far less effect.  I do notice that RPostgreSQL uses something like COPY  FROM STDIN while RODBC issues a bunch of INSERT INTO  columns... values... queries.  I also notice that RODBC seems to choose int8 for integers, while RPostgreSQL chooses int4 where appropriate. p  pI need to do this kind of dataframe copy often, so I would strongvery sincerelystrong appreciate any advice on speeding up RODBC.  For example, is this just inherent in ODBC, or am I not calling it properly  p  pThank you in advance for any assistancep  pJasonp

Negative 1914 pSo, my team and I are working on this application, where we use the DataTables jQuery plugin a hrefhttpdatatables.net relnofollowhttpdatatables.neta to present tabular data provided by our Rails 3.0.7 backend.p  pWere having a problem with the interaction between the datatables builtin AJAX search and sorting functionalities and Rails I18n support. Some of the columns present configuration data that comes from the database created in the seed file but is internationalized, since its a fixed data set. When the user tries to search or sort, we should perform those operations over the visible, I18ned strings. But since search and sorting are delegated to the backend, the controller will perform the required queries over the internal versions of the strings and not the uservisible ones, which will lead to erroneous results.p  pThe solution we thought of first was using the controller top  ul liperform the DB queries without any criteria and store the resultsli liI18n the required values in the result setli lithen sortfilter the results.li ul  pBut this would be too demanding on the server. Another option we considered was including the required I18ns in the tables that have I18nable values, but this breaks the applications separation of concerns. So were at a loss as to what mechanism we should employ to implement this feature. Can anyone help us outp

Basically codedwcode is now deleting everything up through the next bit of whitespace it finds, instead of stopping at punctuation like it should.p  pI really dont want to have to figure out which one is breaking it and how to fix it. Is there a way I can specify in my .vimrc that I dont want it changedp  pstrongEditstrongp  pLuc already answered my question, but I thought I would still clear it up for future readers, because there is a bit of disagreement over what codedwcode is supposed to do by default. Lets say we have the word 1234.5678. By default, on all the systems Ive worked on, if the cursor is on the 1, typing codedwcode should leave you with .5678. When I asked the question, typing dw for me was instead deleting the whole thing 1234.5678. p

Negative 1914 pI working on an application for processing document images mainly invoices and basically, Id like to convert certain regions of interest into an XMLstructure and then classify the document based on that data. Currently I am using ImageJ for analyzing the document image and Asprisetesseract for OCR. p  pNow I am looking for something to make developing easier. Specifically, I am looking for something to automatically deskew a document image and analyze the document structure e.g. converting an image into a quadtree structure for easier processing. Although I prefer Java and ImageJ I am interested in any librariescodepapers regardless of the programming language its written in. p  pWhile the system I am working on should as far as possible process data automatically, the user should oversee the results and, if necessary, correct the classification suggested by the system. Therefore I am interested in using machine learning techniques to achieve more reliable results. When similar documents are processed, e.g. invoices of a specific company, its structure is usually the same. When the user has previously corrected data of documents from a company, these corrections should be considered in the future. I have only limited knowledge of machine learning techniques and would like to know how I could realize my idea. p

Negative 1914 pI have a problem where it seems that when running the same stored procedure at the same time from two different instances of the same application it is timing out, and wondered if there was anything I could do to resolve it p  pI believe the problem is in the way SQL Server 2008 handles itself, locking rows and executing the SPs...things I dont really know a whole lot about. The app uses codeADODB.Commandcode to execute the SP.p  pI have one VB6 exe codeApp.execode, running on the one server multiple times. This app calls a stored proc on the database which returns the next sequence number for that app. This sequence number field is unique for the instance of the application  there is 1 row in a table codetblSequenceNoscode for each instance of the running application.p  pSo for example, say we have running codeApp[a].execode and codeApp[b].execodep  pcodetblSequenceNoscode looks likep  precodeiAppNo iNextSequenceNo   a        1234    b        4567 codepre  pThe stored procedure to get the next sequence number is relatively simplep  precodeCREATE PROEDURE GetNextSequenceNo AppNo varchar1, NextSequenceNo int output AS BEGIN     DECLARE TempSequenceNo int      SELECT NextSequenceNo  iNextSequenceNo      FROM tblSequenceNos      WHERE iAppNo  AppNo      NextSequenceNo  NextSequenceNo  1      UPDATE tblSequenceNos      SET iNextSequenceNo  NextSequenceNo     WHERE iAppNo  AppNo  END codepre  pWhen both codeApp[a].execode and codeApp[b].execode try to run this procedure to get their codeNextSequenceNocode value, they are hanging for about 30Secs ADO timeout.p  pBecause Each app never looks at the each others row, I thought that this would work concurrently without specifing an special Locking.

Negative 1914 pGood evening to you all, p  pThis might be a somewhat broad and subjective question, and if so, do tell and Ill be sure to avoid such questions in the future. p  pMy question is the following p  pIve been assigned to do a Hardware and Software inventory of all of our companys offices which are spread around the country. I thought about coding a small app where the user would simply double click on it and it would automatically recover basic system information Processor, RAM, GFX Card, OS and to whom its licensed and installed programs, and pass it onto a .txt, xlsx or some other file. p  pI was wondering what would be the best approach to develop this app. I care not about the language used, however I believe that, given the required tasks of pulling system information, Visual Basic would be the best option to do so. p  pI would only like to be pointed in the right direction where to begin searching and learning, since every single bit of experience itll be useful even if I dont get to finish the code. Do you guys see this as a terribly problematic quest, or can it be fairly easily accomplished p  pThank you very much in advanced and once again, my apologies if this question does not comply with the sites policies. p  pJorge. p

Negative 1914 pSVGs elliptical arc curve path command takes 9 parameters implicit current X and Y, coderxcode xradius, coderycode yradius, codexaxisrotationcode, codelargearcflagcode, codesweepflagcode, codexcode endpointx, codeycode endpointy. Lets ignore the two flag parameters that I believe to be unimportant for my question. Then 7 parameters remain.p  pNow my question is is the ellipse overdetermined or not I just believe that it is, because providing too small coderxcode and coderycode and an endpoint which is too far the the current point will result in no solution. Thinking this way, only a subset of parameter space forms valid arches, hence the ellipse is overdetermined.p  pOn the other hand, Im not a geometry expert and I know that SVG is a wellthoughtout standard, suggesting that I am wrong.

Negative 1914 pI am trying to write some code to center my main application JFrame in the center of the computer screen using Java.

Negative 1914 pIm sure theres a simple solution to this, but I cant fathom whats going on. I have an entity called a codePaymentcode and two other entities called codeUsercode and codeHouseholdcode.p  pA codeUsercode has many codePaymentcodes and and a codeHouseholdcode has many codePaymentcodes. This is all mapped as unidirectional manyToOne relationships of the codePaymentcode using YAML, like this hopefully this is in line with the guidance at a hrefhttpdocs.doctrineproject.orgprojectsdoctrineormen2.1referenceassociationmapping.htmlmanytooneunidirectional relnofollowhttpdocs.doctrineproject.orgprojectsdoctrineormen2.1referenceassociationmapping.htmlmanytooneunidirectionala  p  precodePayment   type entity   table payments   id     id       type integer       column paymentid       generator         strategy AUTO     manyToOne     user       targetEntity ApplicationModelUser       joinColumn         name userid         referencedColumnName paymentid     household       targetEntity ApplicationModelHousehold       joinColumn         name householdid         referencedColumnName paymentid codepre  pDatabase wise, I have three tables, codeuserscode, codepaymentscode and codehouseholdscode. The codepaymentscode table has in addition to its primary key two columns called codeuseridcode and codehouseholdidcode, which correspond the to primary keys of the other two tables.p  pThe problem is that when I try to persist a new codePaymentcode I get an error back from mySql telling me that the codeuseridcode column of codepaymentscode cannot be null. Some digging has established that doctrine is supplying codenullcode for both codeuseridcode and codehouseholdidcode in the INSERT statement. The object graph is definitely correct. p  pIn addition, I get the following warnings p  precodeNotice Undefined index paymentid in [..]libraryDoctrineORMPersistersBasicEntityPersister.php on line 511  Notice Undefined index in [..]libraryDoctrineORMPersistersBasicEntityPersister.php on line 511  Notice Undefined index paymentid in [..]libraryDoctrineORMPersistersBasicEntityPersister.php on line 511  Notice Undefined index in [..]libraryDoctrineORMPersistersBasicEntityPersister.php on line 511 codepre  pIve established that the codepaymentidcode in question is coming from the codereferencedColumnNamecodes in my mapping, and that the index is undefined because the array doctrine is searching contains the fields from the emoppositeem side of the relationship, i.e. the codeHouseholdcode or the codeUsercode. But surely it shouldnt be I think Ive followed the guide, but I cant make it work.p  pIm using Zend Framework, if it helps, but theres nothing special going on my code.

I cant help but wonder if theres a better way to implement this, because I think codeDistinctcode is pretty big performance hit and also I am not sure if its better to iterate whole second Enumerable and check if item is not present in first Enumerable already like above or if it would be better to iterate codesecond.Exceptfirstcode What do you guys thinkp  pI call it like thisp  precode  var a  new Listltstringgt  a, b, c, d, e, f, j    var b  new Listltstringgt  a, c, d, h, i    Synchronizea.ToArray, b.ToArray, t gt b.Addt, t gt a.Addt codepre  pI call codeToArraycode so collections dont get changed while being iterated over and lambdas just add missing elements to respective lists.p  pAlso, this is just a test implementation. In production environment, Enumerables wont be of same type. This is intended to be used to sync remote and local storage. In future, Enumerable first will be for example codeICollectionltDummyRemoteItemgtcode and Enumerable second will be codeListltIO.FileSystemInfogtcode. But I want it to be more generic. To make it possible to work with different collections, I think I would propose another type parameter and a codeFuncltT1, T2, boolgtcode for comparing items. That would be a best approach, rightp  pGenerally, whats the best way to implement insides of p  precodeSynchronizeltTgtIEnumerableltTgt first,IEnumerableltTgt second,ActionltTgt firstSynchronizer,ActionltTgt secondSynchronizer  codepre  pand p  precodeSynchronizeltTFirst, TSecondgtIEnumerableltTFirstgt first,IEnumerableltTSecondgt second,ActionltTFirstgt firstSynchronizer,ActionltTSecondgt secondSynchronizer, FuncltTFirst, TSecond, boolgt predicate codepre
Negative 1914 pI am really new to Ruby programming and am in the process of trying to learn it. one of the assignments i was given is really stumping me. i need to make a table with 2 columns. the first column will have a list of numbers 1 through 100, the second column will print out the results as per my code.p  pmy ruby code looks like thisp  precode 1..100.each do i   d3  i  3  0    d5  i  5  0    i  i if d5   i  i if d3    puts i if d5  d3 end codepre  phow would i put this in an HTML tablep
Negative 1914 pIm building a Rails app that is probably going to have a large amount of models. For now lets say that i need to have Users, and each User will have a personal Blogp  pIve been developing the Userrelated part on a separate Engine lets call it AuthEngine that encapsulates the User model, authentication, etc. At the time this seemed like the best approachp  pIn parallel, my colleague was developing another engine, to deal with the blog features lets call it BlogEngine. Now he needs to access user data which is stored in the other engine. He achieved this by definingp  precodeBlogEngine.userclass  AuthEngineUser codepre  pThis way, he can easily ask for user data, even though it isnt stored in the same engine. The problem comes when we want to define relashionships between modelsp  pHe can easily say that each blog post belongs to a userp  precodehasone user, classname gt BlogEngine.userclass codepre  pBut as far as i know he cant specify that each User has multiple posts since the User model is within the other enginep  pThe consequence of this is that he cant do things like codeuser.postscode, but instead has to do codePost.findallbyuserusercodep  pIs there a more elegant way to deal with this I also considered the possibility that each engine could simply generate the models inside the app, removing the encapsulation, but since the amount of models will grow quickly, i think this will make the app more of a mess, and not as much maintanablep

Negative 1914 pI have been working to build a more abstract schema, where there had been several tables modeling remarkably similar relationships, I want to model just the essence. Due to the environment I am working with Drupal 7, I cant change the nature of the issue that a relationship of the same essential type could reference one of two different tables for the object in one role. Lets bring in some example to clarify this is not my actual problem domain, but a similar problem. Here are the requirements p  pFirst, if you are unfamiliar with Drupal, heres the gist Users in one table, every other entity in a single second table gross generalization, but enough.p  pLets say we want to model the works for relationship, and lets have the given be that companies are of type entity and supervisor is of type user and by type I mean thats the table in the database where their tuples reside. Here are the simplified requirementsp  ol liA user can work for a companyli liA company can work for a companyli liThese works for relationships should be in the same table.li ol  pI have two ideas, and both dont exactly sit well with my current disposition toward schema quality, and this is where I would like some insight.p  ol liOne foreignkey column paired with a type columnli liTwo foreignkey columns, always at most one utilized ickli ol  pIn case you are a visual thinker, here are the two options representing the fact that users 123 and 632, as well as entity 123 all work for entity 435p  precode  Option 1   employmentid  employeeid  employeetype  employerid                1          123           user          435                2          123         entity          435                3          632           user          435      Option 2   employmentid  employeeuserid  employeeentityid  employerid                1               123              ltNULLgt          435                2            ltNULLgt                 123          435                3               632              ltNULLgt          435   codepre  pThoughts on option 1 I like that the employeeid column has emconcrete roleem, but I despise that it has emambiguous targetem. Option 2 has ambiguous role emwhich column is the employeeem, but has concrete target for any given FK, so I can think of it this way p  precode                     ROLE                      ambiguous  concrete    T                                A  ambig.                 1      R                                G    E                                T  concr.      2                                                 codepre  pOption two has very pragmatic benefits for my project, but I do not feel comfortable with so many nulls you might not even call it 1NFp  pSo heres the crux of my question for SO How can option 1 be improved, or else what knowledge gap might I have that leaves me unsettled While I cant bring to mind a specific emruleem which it violates, the design clearly is not in keeping with the intentions of normalization requiring two columns to uniquely identify a relationship is not doing me any favors for safeguarding against anomalies.p  pI do understand that the emidealem solution would be to redesign the emusersem entity to be the emsameem as what I have been calling entity here, but please consider that beside the pointcircumstantial or at least lets draw the pragmatic line right exactly there for this question.p  pAgain, the essential question strongWhat, in terms of normalization, is wrong with schema option 1, and how might you model this relationship given the constraint of not refactoring user into entitystrongp  pstrongnotestrong emFor this, I am more interested in theoretical purity than a pragmatic solutionemp

Negative 1914 pI have a base class codeIStructurecode which is derived by many classes.p  pSome of these classes reference other codeIStructurecode classes. For example, my class codeclass GuiButton  public IStructurecode has a member of codeTextstringcode which derives from codeIStructurecode, as well.p  pNow Im just glistening over this so I can get to the point, so this may seem weird to some of you. I would like to have a template class Reference that references an codeIStructurecode. For examplep  precodeclass GuiButton  public IStructure  public     ReferenceltTextstringgt Text  codepre  pI know some of you might be wondering why I just dont do codeTextstring Textcode. This is because some of these references are external. The codeReferencecode template class only holds information about the codeIStructurecode ie. Name, etc.. Some of these classes are insanely big and it would be pointless to instantiate that whole class to only use the codeNamecode property and what not. Does that make sensep  pSo now to my questionp  precodeclass Textstring  public IStructure codepre  pI can reference a codeTextstringcode by using my templatep  precodeReferenceltTextstringgt Text codepre  pNow heres the issue Some methods I have require me to upcast to IStructure, for examplep  precodevoid RegisterReferenceReferenceltIStructuregt ampreference codepre  pSo I couldnt do thisp  precodeReferenceltTextstringgt txtTextName RegisterReferencetxt  error codepre  pI know I can cure this by not having codeReferencecode be a template, but I would really like to because it makes it easier to understand and know what type the reference is.p  pWhat are some ways I can accomplish thisp  pThanks for your helpp  pAlexp

Negative 1914 pCurrently I have made a system where many screens are just lists, which update every N seconds depending on how many results per page the user has selected.p  pThis is just a simple ajax call in a setTimeout loop. The main disadvantage I see with this approach I have used is that it is super inefficient in that it creates a lot of unnecessary network traffic and database calls.p  pThe reason for this is that the data on the screen may change at any time, but the user needs to be aware if something new does come into the list so they can react to it as quickly as possible.p  pI was thinking of creating a Twitter style list where all you get is little notification at the top, which is just a COUNT of all the new items that you havent seen. The user would then click on them to have the list refresh with the new items included.p  pThe problem I have with this is that it is not truly a realtime list.p  pI have just started learning about Socket.io and NodeJS but I think it might take me some time to learn what I need to implement a realtime list that is efficient.p  pWhat are your thoughtsp

Negative 1914 pI am wondering if possible what might the most efficient way be to resolve the following cache problemp  pI recently finished a private networking stream a part of my CMF that utilizes the codeigniter framework. The problem is client browser cache. When User A responds to User Bs post. User B isnt able to see the response unless their browser is refreshed.

Negative 1914 pI am trying to make a module for Drupal 7 that provides a block and has certain configuration settings.  Now what I want is that   I want to provide 5 blocks to the user so that they can use different settings in each block.  In other words, I want to provide each block a separate set of settings.  How can I do thatp  pEdit Actually I have made a module that shows a single block. If you have used superfish menu module then you can see there that they allow us an option to choose how many block should be made available. So that for each block we can use different menu to show. I am talking about that functionalityp

There will be other users also whose name can be prakash gupta and they will provide the same username.Now inorder to solve this im using random function and attaching some digits behind the username, so that it will be different for every one.  Now save command will take the username which i entered in the textbox and insert into the database but i want to insert the modified username into the database which i generated by random function. can this be possible  if yes let me know.... p

Negative 1914 pI have a report created in VS2008 on SQL Server 2008 SP3. The report comprises of several sub reports nested 3 or 4 levels down in some instances. Document Maps are used extensively so that Word Tables of Contents can be generated further down the line.p  pNow heres the problem.p  pIf I render to screen either in the development environment or rendered the deployed report from the reporting services server, then everything is OK. If I export the report in any format tested with Word, PDF amp Excel then the output is as expected.p  pHowever, if I create a URL including all the parameters something likep  precodehttpMYSERVERNAMEReportServerPagesReportViewer.aspx2fMYPATH2fMYREPORTNAMEampPARAM1999ampPARAM2999ampPARAM3999amprsCommandRenderamprsFormatHTML4.0 codepre  pthen paste this into an IE window, the output is incorrect. Well let me clarify that.p  pIf I render as above using the HTML4.0 rendering extension then the report renders on screen as expected, all the content is shown. If I render to Word by changing the rsFormat parameter to Word then the report renders but the first page is missing see note about this content below If I render to PDF, the same part of the report is missing. If I render to Excel, the document map generated on the first workbook sheet shows an entry for the missing section of report but clicking the click gives and invalid reference error and indeed that part of the report is again not rendered.p  pNote that the master report for want of a better term is made up of 3 subreports, each of these contain other sub reports.p  pIts the content of the first subreport, that also happens to only every show on the first page as it is just less than a page long that is missing. In Word there is something rendered but it looks like an empty table with a width that is the full width of the page but a heigh of just a few millimetres.p  pIm really at a loss as to why the section does not render when it works perfectly if rendered to screen and then exported. I had assumed they would use the same rendering process but Im not sure.p  pIll continue to experiment, maybe add some blank content before the problem section or something and see where I get but Im puzzled as to why this happens, other reports do not suffer the problem however I have only tested 3 or 4 or the hundreds that I have written. Ive not used the URL method much in the past but I got to this point as I was writing a c application to run the same report with varying parameters to produce over 1200 word documents, each of which takes about 2 mins to run. the output was incorrect there so I worked my way back to creating a manual URL and the problem was still apparent, the rest is historyp
Negative 1914 pI have a Spring webapp running in Glassfish 3.1.2. I am just beginning to convert the webapp to OSGi. I undeployed the existing webapp and copied the spring and gemini OSGi jars into the modules directory in the Glassfish installation. I then installed and activated them using the Glassfish OSGi web console which I understand to be some sort of customised Felix web console and everything was fine. It didnt do anything but I could install and activate them in the web console which is what I wanted to test. p  pI then started to redeploy the strongnonOSGistrong jars of my existing webapp using the Glassfish Application console to see if the 2 type of jars could coexist, which, given my understanding of OSGi I thought they should be able to. At this point codeNoClassDefFoundErrorscode started getting thrown complaining about not being able to find codeorg.apache.commons.loggingcode amongst other classes. These class were present in both the Module directory as the installed OSGi jars and the application classpath. I then deactivated the jars in the console but didnt remove the the OSGi jars but the exceptions continued to be thrown. p  pI got a classloader print out and found that the jars in the codeWEBINFcode of my webapp werent getting loaded but I wasnt sure whether this was the problem or a symptom. p  pI then removed the jars from the uninstalled the OSGi jars and everything started working again and the webapp could be deployed.p  pCan anyone think of any reason why this might happen I am guessing that the content of the module directory is on the classpath but if so why How would I prevent this from causing problems if I want OSGi and nonOSGi jars to work together p  pstrongSide Notesstrong p  ul liWhen I viewed the classes getting loaded by the classloader I couldnt see content form the modules folder getting loaded.li liI can install and activate the OSGi jars after the the nonOSGi jars are deployed but not the other way round.           li ul

Negative 1914 pI think i confused about some concepts and thats why i ask you to help me with thisp  pWe have a big web app used by many users companies which is deployed at user premises. But now we are going saas so in order to setup the app to behave like this were doing some adaptations.p  pIn order to handle our users were working like this we will have a db per user. For sure we need load balancing because we need many servers so i proposed a sharded architecture. My idea is to have web servers which are each one completely independent from each other. So wed have all our users data split in say, 10 servers. So when a user logs in, in fact he would be connecting to server 4 for example. To maintain availability in fact one of those each servers would be a mini cluster of two  three servers whose dbs are replicated among them. We use memcache in each cluster. We could even have a load balancing at this level we just dont think we need it because datausers is already split.p  pSome questionsp  ol lipis this sharding  notice that each cluster serves a given group of users and there is no relationship between clusters. We dont have a main db with federated dbs in each cluster but the same db structure, just that it is split among servers.pli lipHow do i redirect users when they arrive the first time not authenticated isnt it here where load balancing applies  but if users data is split among servers  ive been thinking that here wed have a publicauthentication cluster which would deal with unauthenticated users, the public part of the site. And depending on a very simple memcache db it would redirect users to the respective cluster where their data lies. If so ..pli liphow do i redirect them  the only way i see it would be to send them to something like explained a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions215347shardingsicthewebtierinordertopreventaloadbalancerbottleneckherea. Its just that i didnt want server123.mysite.com. pli ol  pI think the publicauthentication cluster is not well designed. Because i have 23 servers merely for serving the main site to all users before authentication while in the back i have 56 clusters and some of them might be sleeping. or the opposite i have a heavily loaded cluster while the public one is sleeping because its sole task is to show the main page and handle the redirecttologin process.p  pIf all this works, p  ol liis this structure ok  please assume that each user is heavy in fact we have more than just a php running but also .NET and other services working, etc. I dont think of it as an overkill but just a structure to handle multiple users. Do you have other ideas li ol  pThanks for your help.p

I added the following to my config.rup  precode This file is used by Rackbased servers to start the application. require File.expandpath..configenvironment,  FILE begin   require unicornoobgc rescue LoadError, NameError end  Outofband GC, runs GC after every 10th request and after the response  has been delivered. begin   use UnicornOobGC, interval10 rescue NameError end  run MyAppApplication  GC.start codepre  pIm looking at my NewRelic portal however, and most web transactions do indicate that at least 110150ms is spent on average doing garbage collection. Is UnicornOoobGC supposed to do it out of the scope of the actual request If it is, why is this showing up in the web transaction How do I get time spent on garbage collection to happen outside the context of a web request so that perceived client response times are faster CPU time spent will still be the same since it needs to happen in the background, however, better in the background than holding up a request pipeline.p

You can see the whole code belowp  precodeExt.defineTestApp.App,  extend Ext.app.Application   Ext.application extend MyApp.app.Application,  store null,  launch function      var self  this     self.store  Ext.createExt.data.Store,          fields [when, data1, data2, data3, data4, data5, data6, data7, data8, data9],         proxy              type memory         ,         sorters [             property when,             direction ASC         ]          self.beginTask ,  beginTask function      var self  this     Ext.TaskManager.start         run function              var jsonRaw  very large json about 650 samples             var json  Ext.JSON.decodejsonRaw, true                 self.store.addjson.data.samples                 var ln  self.store.getCount                 for var j0 jltln j                      var record  self.store.getAtj                     self.store.removeself.store.getAtj                     j                     ln                     record.destroy                     delete record                              json  null             jsonRaw  null         ,         interval 1000        codepre  pNow the strange part about this memory leak is present even if the store part is commented like in code listing above. Did I made some mistake with task managementp
Negative 1914 pWe are trying to access the SaveFormat property of a Microsoft.Office.Interop.Word.Document instance I guess its technically a DocumentClass instance since Document is an interface. Upon attempting to read SaveFormat, Word crashes rather ungracefully. Wrapping the access in a try..catch block is no good, either control is getting passed to another assembly which decides to terminate the app rather than throwing the exception for me to recatch.p  pThis occurs whether Im simply reading the property in code, like thisp  precodeWdSaveFormat saveFormat  this.document.SaveFormat  document is a Microsoft.Office.Interop.Word.Document codepre  pOr when I access the property in a Watch using the debugger.p  pI suspect the document instance itself is fine its other properties e.g., Path can be reflected on. Running a quickwatch on the document object yields legitimatelooking values rather than a bunch of redflagraising could not evaluate, null, etc. values.

Negative 1914 pWe use directory browsing on a specific section of our website, but our users dont really like the default ASP.NET p  pdirectory browsing. To be honest, we dont particularly care for it either.p  pI came across mvolos custom directory browsing module and I attempted to use it. However, I discovered that if I have it enabled in my root web.config, it allows directory browsing on all folders without a default page as you would expect. If I set enabledfalse in the root, it throws an HttpException, which is being caught by my generic error page, but every request is causing the exception, like when the page requested has additional images to request during the load.p  pAs I believe and I could be wrong, the default directory browsing module only checks for the enabled attribute if there is no default folder and you arent requesting a specific file for example, mysite.comimages versus mysite.comimageslogo.gif.p  pI have reconstructed the functionality of the custom module, but I am unable to figure out how to limit the module to only fully execute in situations where directory browsing would be necessary if enabled  and not for every single request.

Negative 1914 pAs a summary Im trying to get String.Concat to use a reference types ToString overload when sticking string together.brbR Edit Added this overview The example code below is a cooked down extract of my real code  as such it would be immediately obvious when refactoring if I only had two lines of code.  The important issue here to me is that I changed from a string to an object and there was no compile error from String.Concat.  Equally its behaviour wasnt what I would have expected Using my objects to string method, rather than the bog standard object name.  If Id been using amp, there would have been a compile error.  Im concerned that the String.Concat syntactic sugar may lead to bugs that otherwise would have been avoided in this case when refactoring.  Id like to know if theres a way of altering the behaviour of String.Concat or if I should consider it to be dangerous.brBr The situationbRIve got a solution which processes a whole heap of data  I was using a String to contain the identifier of each piece of data, but have just swapped this out for a class FeatureIdentifier to enable me to extend the identifier to include things like batches etc.brbr Ive refactored my code so that I use this class instead of just the string.  When refactoring this type of thing rightly or wrongly I tend to rely on compile errors as a todo list.brbr Now, Im a selftaught programmer and Im probably a bit set in my ways I tend to look at new features in terms of if they let me do anything new rather than if they let me do stuff I can already do only easier and Ive just come across something which makes me sad.brbr So, I was sticking my identifier onto an underscore onto a type.  My code looked like this brcodeDim x as string  MyIdentifercodebr codedim myOutputValue as string  String.Concatx,ANCHOR.txtcodebr Running this I got myOutputValue equal to MyIdentifierANCHOR.txt.  Following refactoring, my code looked like thisbr codeDim x as new FeatureIdentifierMyIdentifiercodebR codedim myOutputValue as string  String.Concatx,ANCHOR.txtcodebr Running this I got myOutputValue equal to MyNamespace.FeatureIdentifierANCHOR.txt.br br Having kicked myself and implemented a ToString method on my class, I run it again and get exactly the same output that is MyNamespace.FeatureIdentifierANCHOR.txt.  In immediate, if I do x.ToString, I get MyIdentifier, so Im certain Ive implemented ToString correctly.brbr So, heres my problem.  I like the syntax of String.Concat but I dont like the fact that it doesnt do one of br a calling ToString on reference types it sticks together orbrb throwing a compile error if you pass it nonstring based arguments.  The old school x amp ANCHOR.txt gives me a compile error which I would have picked up when refactoring.brbr Heres what Ive triedbr Ive tried shadowing the String.Concat function with an extension something like thisbr codeltSystem.Runtime.CompilerServices.Extensiongt Public Function Concat...some arguments... As Stringcodebr codeReturn String.Concat...some arguments...codebr codeEnd Functioncodebr  but hit two problemsbr 1 When trying to narrow the type of the arguments down to string to cause compile errors, I realised that the argument is a param array and hence objects in the first place.  So fail there.bR 2 When I tried to make multiple overloads s1 as string, s2 as string, s1 as string, s2 as string, s3 as string etc, I felt it was a bit lame and also discovered that you cant actually overload an extension on a static class which is what I guess String is.brbr So, does anyone know a way of getting String.Concat to behave as well as oldschool concatenation, or should I avoid String.Concat in favour of oldschool concatenation.br Im not going to use a StringBuilder, as Im only concatenating a few strings and I dont believe this is the place for one.p
Negative 1914 pI understand the aspects of templates in C that are different from generics in Java and C. C is a reification, Java uses type erasure, C uses duck typing, etc. There are a number of things C templates can do that Java and C generics cant e.g. template specialization. But there are strikea number of things Java generics can do that C and C cant e.g. make a bounded type parameter of a family of generics like codeclass FooltT extends Comparableltgtgtcode, andstrike a number of things C generics can do that Java and C cant e.g. runtime generic reflection. em[EDIT Apparently Java generics are much weaker than I thought. Which is saying something. In any case, despite their ineptness, they are still considered generics along with Cs generics.]emp  pWhat I dont understand is what conceptually makes templates different from generics. What parts of C templates are things that cannot be done in something that isnt a template, but is a generic For example, if I were to implement a language that supported templates, what would absolutely need to be in it What could I leave out that would be necessary for the language to support genericsp  pMy guess is that templates are a superset of generics or they are a way to implement generics, but I dont really understand what separates a true template from a true generic.p

While working on something I go to open up a file in the solution explorer and it turns out that the file is already open, and so visual studios just sets that file as the active tab. If I were working In just one window that would be fine, but I have few tab windows open beyond the main window and they are normally on a diffident monitor, so when the tab becomes active I do not see it at all, because it is not on the main window. This is even worse when I go to preview a file.p  pIcing on this cake If it would have an option to highlight the parent nodes of open files, i the example controllers and content folders would be highlighted as well. If there was something that would do this for vs 2010 as well would be great.p  pI am looking for all most any thing at this point, an extension, a style sheet some where to edit, or as a last resort a good reference to a How to code Extensions for Visual studios website.p  pEdit br As a point Of clarification I am not looking for a way to locate a specific file in the solution explorer, I am looking for a way to make the files that are open look visually different, so that I know to look around a bit before thinking that VS2012 is crashing or the file is messed up. p

Negative 1914 pI have a string which emcontainsem not emisem JSONencoded data, like in this examplep  precodefoo[1, 2, 3], some more stuff                start     end   of JSONencoded data codepre  pThe complete language we use in our application nests JSONencoded data, while the rest of the language is trivial just recursive stuff. When parsing strings like this from left to right in a recursive parser, I know when I encounter a JSONencoded value, like here the code[1, 2, 3]code starting at index 4. After parsing this substring, I need to know the end position to continue parsing the rest of the string.p  pId like to pass this substring to a welltested JSONparser like codeQJsonDocumentcode in Qt5. But as reading a hrefhttpqtproject.orgdocqt5.0qtcoreqjsondocument.html relnofollowthe documentationa, there is no possibility to parse only a substring as JSON, meaning that as soon as the parsed data ends after consuming the code]code here control returns without reporting a parse error. Also, I need to know the end position to continue parsing my own stuff here the remaining string is code, some more stuffcode.p  pTo do this, I used to use a custom JSON parser which takes the current position by reference and updates it after finishing parsing. But since its a securitycritical part of a business application, we dont want to stick to my selfcrafted parser anymore. I mean there is codeQJsonDocumentcode, so why not use it. We already use Qt5.p  pAs a workaround, Im thinking of this approachp  ul liLet codeQJsonDocumentcode parse the substring starting from the current position which is no valid JSONli liThe error reports an unexpected character, this is some position beyond the JSONli liLet codeQJsonDocumentcode parse again, but this time the substring with the correct end positionli ul  pA second idea is to write a JSON end scanner which takes the whole string, a start position and returns the end position of the JSONencoded data.

DELIMITERTOKEN ...                      lt and so on... codepre  pI want to search for documents which contains for example codeTOKEN1code, codeTOKEN3code, and codeTOKEN8code, but in between the same codeDELIMITERTOKENcode pair.p  pMy first idea was that I could create a codeSpanNearQuerycode for the searched terms with a large slop, then I could create a codeSpanNotQuerycode which I could use to exclude the overlapping DELIMITERTOKENs from the previous querys matches, so I wouldnt get matches likep  precodeDELIMITERTOKEN TOKEN1 TOKEN3 DELIMITERTOKEN TOKEN8 codepre  pI guess this solution should work.p  pBut sometimes I have to handle more complex cases, such as searching forp  precodeTOKEN1 TOKEN2 TOKEN8 DELIMITERTOKEN TOKEN3 DELIMITERTOKEN codepre  p...which means that I want to find a block in a document which contains among others the TOKEN1, TOKEN2 and TOKEN8 tokens, and it has a block next to it, which contains TOKEN3 among others.p  pMy idea is to use SpanNotQueries like in the simple case, and create a SpanNearQuery like thisp  precodenew SpanNearQuerynew SpanQuery[]          queryForFirstBlock,         queryForDelimiter,         queryForSecondBlock         0,         true codepre  pBut I think this wouldnt work because the query for the first block dont necessarily spans the whole block. I think I will have to introduce some slop in this last Near Query in order to handle these cases. But if I choose to introduce slop greater than 0, then it will allow matches like thisp  precodeDELIMITERTOKEN     TOKEN1                                  TOKEN2             first near query             TOKEN8                                  DELIMITERTOKEN                             the top query TOKENX                                   DELIMITERTOKEN     delitimer            TOKEN3             second near query    codepre

Negative 1914 h2Backgroundh2  pI have a glorified CRUD application that Id like to enable HTML5 offline support with. The cachemanifest system looks simple yet powerful, but Im curious about how I can allow users to access data while offline.p  pFor example, suppose I have these pages for the entity Case i.e. this is CRM casemanagement softwarep  precodehttpmyapplication.comCase httpmyapplication.comCaseid httpmyapplication.comCaseCreate codepre  pThe first URI contains a paged listing of all cases, using the querystring parameters codepageIndexcode and codepageSizecode, e.g. codeCasepageIndex2amppageSize20code.p  pThe second URI is the template for editing individual cases, e.g. codeCase1code or codeCase56code.p  pFinally, codeCaseCreatecode is the form used to create cases.p  h2The Problemh2  pI would like all three to be available offline.p  h3Caseh3  pThe simple way would be to add codeCasecode to the cachemanifest, however that would break paging as the links wouldnt work.p  pI think I could instead add something like codeCaseAllDatacode which is an XML resource, which is cached and if offline then a script on codeCasecode would use this XML data to populate the list and provide for pagination.p  pIf I go for the latter, how can I have this XML data stored in the inbrowser SQL database instead of as a cached resource I think using the SQL database would be more resilient.p  h3Caseidh3  pThis is more complicated. There is the simple solution of manually adding codeCase1code, codeCase2code, codeCase3code etc... to codeCase1234code, but there can be hundreds or even thousands of cases so this isnt very practical.p  pI think the system should provide access to the 30 most recent cases, for example. As above, how can I store this data in the databasep  pAlso, how would this work If I dont explicitly add codeCase34code to the manifest and the user clicks on to codeCase34code how can I get the browser to load a page that my JavaScript will populate based on the browsers SQL database data and not display the offline messagep  h3CaseCreateh3  pThis one is more simple  as its just an empty page and on the codeltformgtcodes codesubmitcode action my script would detect if its offline, and if it is offline then it would add it to the browsers SQL database. Does this sound okayp  pThanksp

Negative 1914 pI have been using NSTimers to trigger certain events in my app which are timesensitive basically that have to happen when I tell them to happen with up to the second resolution. However, I have been experiencing that, some times, the timer fires before, so that if I record the date at which the timer fires, it might say code143459code instead of code143500code. This is a bit annoying. I searched the a hrefhttpsdeveloper.apple.comlibrarymacdocumentationCocoaReferenceFoundationClassesNSTimerClassReferenceNSTimer.html relnofollowdocsa for an explanation and found thisp  ul liBecause of the various input sources a typical run loop manages, the effective resolution of the time interval for a timer is limited to on the order of 50100 milliseconds.li ul  pand thisp  ul liIf a timers firing time occurs during a long callout or while the run loop is in a mode that is not monitoring the timer, the timer does not fire until the next time the run loop checks the timer.li ul  pSo timers have a resolution of 100 milisecs, which could explain why the timer triggers before, but only if that made any sense. And the reason why it doesnt is that one would think the 100ms difference is caused by emdelaysem, not the contrary.p  pSo, strong1strong why are timers triggereing before their time, and strong2strong how can I avoid thisp  pstrongEDITstrongp  pThis is how I am calculating the datep  ol liI start with a NSDate object either [NSDate now] or a date from a NSDatePickerli liI add to that date emxem number of days using NSDateComponentsli liI set the the hour, number and seconds of that date but keeping the daymonthyear from step 2, again using NSDateComponentsli lipI set the timer this wayp  ptimer  [NSTimer timerWithTimeInterval 10 target self selector selectormyMethod userInfo nil repeats NO]p  p[timer setFireDate firingDate]p  p[[NSRunLoop currentRunLoop] addTimer timer forMode NSRunLoopCommonModes]pli ol  pstrongEDIT 2strongp  pI have also logged the time interval instead of the hoursminutesseconds and it is always codex.0000code, which means it is at the exact start of the second, exactly how it should be not before, not after.p

Negative 1914 pI have a windows service written in .NET 4 that creates multiple threads that contain infinitely running whilerunning loops.  When I stop the service, the running boolean becomes false and we break out of the while loop and once each thread does that, the service finally stops.p  pInside the while, it calls oMessageReceiver.ReceiveTimeSpan.FromSeconds30.  so sometimes when I try to stop the service, I have to wait up to 30 seconds for the Receive process to timeout.p  pOne option would be to lower the timeout from 30 seconds to something smaller.  Im not sure of what performance penalties itd incur, but since the process doesnt do any work without a BrokeredMessage, really Id like to keep the listener open as often and long as possible.p  pI see that there is a .BeginReceive method on the MessageReceiver.  I have a sense there would be a programming pattern I could use here that would prevent my service from hanging while I was waiting for the Receive to timeout.  Can anyone describe how to use the BeginEnd APM functions in an infinitely running Windows Servicep

A bit of background, I am automating my home brewery, and although it is all up and running, the temperature control of the RIMs is all over the place.  For those not familiar with what a RIMs is, it is a way of ensuring the grains that are being soaked are kept at a very constant temperature.  It does this by using a pump and a heating element to heat fluid taken from the bottom of the soaking vessel and passing it past the heating element and heating the fluid as it goes if needed.  The code I have running at the moment is dumb so I need to replace it with something more intelligent, like a PID To heat the heater element Plan on using a simple function called every second that will change the amount of time the element is powered from 100ms to 1000ms depending on how much correction to the temperature is needed.p  pOk, so I have the code, its just how to use it  I want to get it up and running in a stand alone windows form project using vb.net.

Negative 1914 pI have an 8 core CPU with 8GB of RAM, and Im creating a batch file to automate 7zip CLI in exhausting most parameters and variables to compress the same set of files with the ultimate goal of finding the strongest combination of parameters and variables that result in the smallest archive size possible.p  pThis is very time consuming by nature especially when the set of files to be processed is in gigabytes. I need a way not only to automate but to speed up this whole process.p  p7zip works with different compression algorithms, some are singlethreaded only, and some are multithreaded, some do not require much amount of memory, and some require huge amounts of it and could even surpass the 8GB barrier. Ive already successfully created an automated batch that works in sequence which exclude combinations requiring more than 8GB of memory.p  pIve split the different compression algorithms in several batches to simplify the whole process.

Negative 1914 pI recently have released a small application with a trial to the Windows Phone Marketplace, but my application is not working as expected. I have followed a hrefhttpcode.msdn.microsoft.comTrialExperienceSamplec58f21af relnofollowhttpcode.msdn.microsoft.comTrialExperienceSamplec58f21afa when making my trial, so that I can call the current LicenseInformation state and block a feature or not depending on the current applications license state. According to the sample application, codeThe LicenseMode property returns a value from the LicenseModes enum Full, MissingOrRevoked, or Trial so that your app code needs to check only a single value. Theres also a convenient Boolean IsFull property. Whenever the license mode has changed, or it is likely to have changed, TrialExperienceHelper raises its LicenseChanged event and your app code can handle that event to query LicenseMode or IsFull again. Then, your app can control the availability of features, ads, and your Buy UI as needed.codep  pIn my application I have a click event in which I would like to perform an action based on the current LicenseInformation state and upon a count the count being the number of times an image is saved with particular aspects applied. p  pcodeSettings.SavedCount.Valuecode records the number of times the save button is clicked, and if the count is above 100 and the application is in trial mode I would like to ask the user if they would like to upgrade, otherwise if the count is less than 100 while the application is in trial mode or if the license is in full mode then the user is allowed to continue with the save process hopefully that makes logical sense.p  precodevoid saveButtonClickobject sender, EventArgs e      Settings.SavedCount.Value  1              if TrialViewModel.LicenseModeString  Trial ampamp Settings.SavedCount.Value gt 100              MessageBoxResult result  MessageBox.ShowYou have saved over 100 items Would you like to continue, Congratulations, MeesageBoxButton.OKCancel          switch result                      case MessageBoxResult.OK                 A command takes a parameter so pass null                 TrialViewModel.BuyCommand.Executenull                 break             case MessageBoxResult.Cancel                 editPagePivotControl.SelectedIndex  0                 break                                     else if TrialViewModel.LicenseModeString  Trial ampamp Settings.SavedCount.Value lt 100  TrialViewModel.LicenseModeString  Full                      PerformSaveAsync                codepre  pWhen testing in Debug mode and with the sample implementation from the msdn website, the Trial and Full implementations worked properly, and then when in Release mode the license was listed as MissingOrRevoked which I assumed would be called correctly in the marketplace. What is ACTUALLY occuring when i have downloaded the app in the marketplace under both trial and full modes is that the codePerformSaveAsynccode method is never being called which ultimately saves the new image and disables the button and I can use the new image elsewhere. I am having trouble figuring out what the issue may bep  pEDIT In researching I came across a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibraryaa691310vvs.71.aspx relnofollowhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibraryaa691310vvs.71.aspxa which states that codeThe operation x ampamp y corresponds to the operation x amp y, except that y is evaluated only if x is true.code and The operation x  y corresponds to the operation x  y, except that y is evaluated only if x is false .

Negative 1914 pI developed a Web Service that checks user authorizations by querying a central database. It should be consumed by any application whenever a user starts it, in order to check if the user is allowed to run the application. Since in the company there are many old applications written in Visual Basic 6 by people that do not have good programming skills, Im trying to create a DLL that they can easily use in their VB6 applications to check user authorizations through a simple function call instead of dealing with details such as Web Service calls and XML messages.p  pI created a strongClass Librarystrong in Visual Studio 2010 using C, which simply strongwraps the Web Service functionsstrong. I successfully created the DLL file and registered it through RegAsm into another machine used to develop Visual Basic 6 applications.p  pIn VB6, the intellisense shows the functions exposed by the DLL that can be called but it is not working for the complex types returned by the functions. For example, the DLL defines the following function, where the returned type codeUsercode is defined into the Web Service codep  precode[ClassInterfaceClassInterfaceType.AutoDual] [ProgIdAuthorLibrary.Author] [GuidD2E23F5EC209464AAF32CC0251078076] [ComDefaultInterfacetypeofIAuthor] public class Author  AuthorLibrary.IAuthor      [...]      public User getUserDatastring username              ResponseMessageOfUser user         using AccessControlSoapClient ws  new AccessControlSoapClient                      user  ws.getUserDatausername                  if user.response  ResponseType.Ok             throw new Exceptionuser.response.ToString         return user.result           [...]  codepre  pIn VB6, the following code runs correctlyp  precode    Dim ws As AuthorLibrary.Author     Set ws  New AuthorLibrary.Author      Dim u As AuthorLibrary.User     Set u  ws.getUserDatajohn.smith     Text1.Text  u.email codepre  pThe problem is that when the developer writes codeu.code nothing appears and so he does not know the available properties andor methods for the object even if, in the example above, codeu.emailcode works.p  pAnother method returns an instance of codeDepartmentcode lets call it codedeptcode. I can successfully print the values of simple codestringcode properties like codedept.Descriptioncode or codedept.Codecode, but more complex properties such as codedept.childrenDepartmentscode  which should return a list of codeDepartmentcode  give an error Missing object.p  pI think the problem is that strongthe DLL file does not show the classestypesstructures defined into the Web Servicestrong.

Right now, because there is already an image aligned to the left of the table row, the image which I want aligned to the center of the page is aligning with ONLY the available space, so its over to the right a bit too much. p  pHere is the work I have done sofar, please keep in mind, that this is only day two or working on it, so it is clearly quite messy sofarp  precodeltDOCTYPE html PUBLIC W3CDTD XHTML 1.0 TransitionalEN httpwww.w3.orgTRxhtml1DTDxhtml1transitional.dtdgt lthtml xmlnshttpwww.w3.org1999xhtmlgt ltheadgt ltmeta httpequivContentType contenttexthtml charsetutf8 gt lttitlegtBlanklttitlegt  ltstyle typetextcssgt  body  backgroundrepeatnorepeat backgroundcolor045FB4 margintop 0px marginleft 0px marginright 0px   Alink color 808080  Avisited color 808080  Ahover color 990000  formwrap  font 14px Arial, Helvetica, sansserif color FFFFFF width 800px height 600px borderradius15px boxshadow 0px 0px 0px 8px rgba0,0,0,0.3   marginright auto marginleft auto backgroundcolor08298A opacity0.8    header  font15px Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif colorFFF width100 height30px marginright auto marginleft auto backgroundcolor999 opacity 0.6 textalignleft paddingbottom5px paddingleft5px paddingtop5px paddingright0px lineheight 30px    imglogo.png  position absolute left 0   ltstylegt    ltheadgt  ltbodygt  lttable aligncenter width100 height100gt  ltdiv idheader aligncentergt Welcome to Blank. ltdivgt  lttrgt  ltimg srchttpplacehold.it100x100 width100px height100px stylepadding10px altThis image cannot be displayed. alignleftgt ltdiv aligncenter stylewidth100gt ltimg srchttpplacehold.it728x90 stylepadding14px altThis image cannot be displayed. aligncenter styleclearboth stylefloatleftgt  ltdivgt  lttrgt  ltbr gt lttr aligncentergt lttd aligncenter height100gt  ltimg srchttpplacehold.it160x40 padding0pxgt ltimg srchttpplacehold.it160x40 padding0pxgt ltimg srchttpplacehold.it160x40 padding0pxgt ltimg srchttpplacehold.it160x40 padding0pxgt ltimg srchttpplacehold.it160x40 padding0pxgt lttdgt lttrgt  lttr aligncentergt  lttd aligncenter height100gt ltbrgt ltbrgt ltdiv idformwrapgt  ltbrgt Text test.  ltdivgt lttdgt  lttrgt lttablegt      ltbodygt lthtmlgt codepre

Negative 1914 pWe are running on Amazon, using node with express, and connectmongostore to manage the sessions. The load balancer sends a test to the servers every 15 seconds to make sure the app is alive. We have coded an API call for it to check, which tests if both node and mongo are working. However, this creates a session, with each call, as its not a web browser, so a new session record gets built. We have 80,000 records in our session database, that expire every four weeks. Wondering if there is any way to prevent this happening, without having to hack either express or connectmongostore.p

Negative 1914 h2Introductionh2  pThe C11 standard ISOIEC 98992011 has introduced a new definition of side effect sequencing within an expression a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions21066593sequencepointsandsideeffectsquietchangeinc11see related questiona. The emsequence pointem concept has been complemented with emsequenced beforeem and emsequenced afterem relations which are now the basis for all definitions.p  pSection 6.5 Expressions, point 2 saysp  blockquote   pIf a side effect on a scalar object is unsequenced relative to either a different side effect   on the same scalar object or a value computation using the value of the same scalar   object, the behavior is undefined. If there are multiple allowable orderings of the   subexpressions of an expression, the behavior is undefined if such an unsequenced side   effect occurs in any of the orderings.p blockquote  pLater on, section 6.5.16 Assignment operators, point 3 statesp  blockquote   pThe side effect of updating the stored value of the left operand is sequenced after the value computations of the left and right operands. The evaluations of   the operands are unsequenced.p blockquote  h2Problemh2  pThe first quoted paragraph 6.52 is supported by two examples same as in the C99 standardp  h3First exampleh3  precodea[i]  i   undefined a[i]  i      allowed codepre  pThis can be easily explained with the definitionsp  ol liemIf a side effect on a scalar object is unsequenced relative to ... a value computation using the value of the same scalar object, the behavior is undefined.em 6.52,li liemThe evaluations of the operands are unsequenced.em [within an assignment] 6.5.163.li ol  pSo, the side effect of codeicode LHS is unsequenced with codeicode RHS, which gives undefined behaviour.p  h3Second exampleh3  precodei  i  1  undefined i  i  1     allowed codepre  pThis code, however, seems to result in a defined behaviour in both given cases asp  ol liemthe side effect of updating the stored value of the left operand is sequenced after the value computations of the left and right operands.emli ol  pSo, the execution of codei  1code shall precede the side effect of updating codeicode, which means that there is not ema side effect on a scalar object unsequenced relative to either a different side effect on the same scalar object or a value computation using the value of the same scalar object.emp  h2Questionh2  pIt is easy to explain these examples with the terms and definitions presented by the C99 standard a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions4176328undefinedbehaviorandsequencepointsrq1see related questiona.

But once Im there, how the heck do I get the information back into my View Model As far as I know the view knows nothing about the view model.p  pThe only thing I can think of is I need to create some property that contains the PCL object that was clicked on. This method would stuff the item into that property, and through some magic of databinding that would be sent back to the view model. If so, I have no idea how to participate in the databinding process to get that right Ack p  pI dont know if this makes a difference yet, but Im not using universal apps And Im using a nasty hybrid of Caliburn.Micro to hook up my views, and Reactiveui and rx to run all my commands. I dont like making anything easyp

Negative 1914 pWhats the difference between or eax,eax and test eax,eax Ive seen different compilers produce both for the same comparison and as far as documentation goes they do exactly the same thing, so Im wondering why they dont all use test eax,eax. Thinking about it and eax,eax would set the flags in an identical fashion as either but I havent seen it in either freepascal, delphi, or msVC.p  pI did compile some asm blocks in delphi and checked out the assembler source and all 3 forms are the exact same length in opcodes and also checked the intel performance pdf and it says they have the same latency and throughput.p  pedit The question is specifically about the difference between the specific cases test eax,eax or eax,eax and eax,eax. All 3 give completely identical results for registers, flags, opcode length, latency, throughput. And yet for testing if 0, if not zero, or if signed, some compilers will use test eax,eax while some use or eax,eax, and I was wondering why they arent all using test eax,eax since it makes the code very slightly clearer.p  pedit2 for reference im at home and only have and older msvc and delphi here, but testing a variable if zero, msvc does test eax,eax, while delphi does or eax,eaxp

The problem is that I dont know exactly where to do the algorithm.

Negative 1914 pIve been happily using MySQl for years, and have followed the MariahDB fork with interest.p  pThe server for one of my projects is reaching end of life and needs to be rehosted  likely to CentOS 7, which includes MariahDBp  pOne of my concerns is the lack of the merge table feature, which I use extensively.  We have a very large at least by my standards data set with on the order of 100M records20 GB with most data compressed and growing.  Ive split this into read only compressed myisam archive tables organized by data epoch, and a regular myisam table for current data and inserts.  I then span all of these with a merge table.  p  pThe software working against this database is then written such that it figures out which table to retrieve data from for the timespan in question, and if the timespan spans multiple tables, it queries the overlying merge table.p  pThis does a few things for mep  ul liQueries are strongmuchstrong faster against the smaller tables  unfortunately, the index needed for the most typical query, and preventing duplicate records is relatively complicatedli liFrees the user from having to query multiple tables and assemble the results when a query spans multiple tablesli liAllowing  90 of the data to reside in the compressed tables saves alot of disk spaceli liI can back up the archive tables once  this saves tremendous time, bandwidth and storage on the nightly backupsli ul  pAn suggestions for how to handle this without merge tables  Does any other table type offer the compressed, readonly option that myisam doesp  pIm thinking we may have to go with separate tables, and live with the additional complication and changing all the code in the multiple projects which use this database.p

Negative 1914 pI have a number of microservices built with Spring Boot, so for a bit of fun, I thought Id have a go at adding HATEOAS to them to help set up crossresource linking.

As an example, imagine I have 3 servicesp  pA user details service Codep  precodeusersuserid codepre  pA user calendar service Codep  precodeusersuseridappointments usersuseridappointmentsappointmentid codepre  pA user messaging service Codep  precodeusersuseridmessages usersuseridmessagesmessageid codepre  pTo make this browsable via the API, it would be good to have links from a user resource to its appointments and messages. Similarly, it would be nice to have links back from those resources. This is all very achievable when I have a single API with everything on the classpath, where I can write code such asp  pCodep  precodeuser.addlinkTomethodOnCalendarController.class.appointmentsuser.getKey.withRelappointments codepre  pHowever Im not able to do this if CalendarController is not on the classpath of the service Im currently hitting.p  pIs there a goodrecommended method for creating links to controllers which are not in the current projectp  pReferenced from a hrefhttpforum.spring.ioforumspringprojectsweb749306crossservicelinkingforhateoasmicroservicesspring forumsap

Negative 1914 pMy main question is what is the typical way mobile apps authenticate users I know that AmazonCognito is used to sync userdata once you receive a token, but that token is simply a set of access rules, right Which has nothing to do with a particular user just the fact that they are an authenticated user in general.p  pBut before even that, there needs to be a way to authenticate a usernamepass that the user signed up for so that you can retrieve the token. In almost all of the documentation, they use FacebookGoogleetc as examples of third party providers, and there IS an example of setting up your own 3rd party provider, but this all requires your own backend to service that. Cp  ponsidering that there may be many users trying to user the app and authenticate, does it not seem like a bad idea to set up a backend somewhere else And is there a way to integrate this part into AWS as well so that there is no custom backend work How is this typically donep  pSite node Im using Android SDK at the moment.p  pThanks p

Negative 1914 pIts no secret that autolayout with UIScrollViews can be incredibly tricky and hard to achieve desired effects. I have a scroll view with four images and I want each image to be centered on its own page of the scroll view. I was able to accomplish this using autolayout with hardcoded leading and trailing constraint values on the iPhone 5s but on the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus, the content is shifted left of center because of the larger screen width.p  pIs there a way I can achieve centered, scrollable content on separate pages that works for all size classes using autolayoutp

I used the transcoding example from ffmpeg to see if I could reencode the video with the filters, and that does indeed work. With that example I basically changed the filter being fed the filtergtaph and most of the work is already done. At this point all I am doing is to display the video using SDL as shown in dangers tutorial. The cropping filter creates a lot of artifacts but it is at least showing something.p  pI have to do some more work to see if it will work with GTK. I have not taken a detailed look at the differences between the above program and the one in the transcoding example, so I have not yet figured out why my old code does not display filtered frames. Both sets of code use swsscale but I get no errors with the new code, so that must mean that something is different. I will update this post once I make more progress.p  pEDIT 2 Added a small compilable example that should work, as per drahnrs request. I have not had the chance to try out replacing GtkPixbuf.p  precodedefine XOPENSOURCE 600  include ltlibavformatavformat.hgt include ltlibavformatavio.hgt include ltlibavfilteravfiltergraph.hgt

Negative 1914 pI am creating an Android game to help people learn to type in Braille. This is not an app for reading Braille with your fingers, but it does include some interactive images of Braille cells.p  pI have created an interface which shows Braille dots on the screen. As you move your fingers over the dots, the device vibrates, and a specific MIDI note is played, depending on which dot you are currently touching.p  pAll well and good. Now for the problem.p  pMost users who want to learn Braille also want to have TalkBack active on their Android phone. However, when TalkBack is active, it intercepts all single finger sliding touch actions. This prevents me from triggering vibrations and MIDI sounds when the user touches with a single finger.p  pI can design my interface to use TalkBack texttospeech but this is a poor solution the main value of my app cannot be conveyed just by texttospeech.p  pI have seen that many other developers have encountered similar difficulties, where TalkBack prevents them from creating value for the very users that TalkBalk is intended to help. Who can I contact at Google to start a discussion that will lead to a tactileuserfriendly solutionp  hr  pEDIT  p  pOne workaround is to ask the user to touch the screen with 2 fingers. One finger will be ignored while the other can be used to explore the screen as if TalkBack were disabled. Unfortunately, it is difficult to predict which of the two fingers will be treated as the active finger.p

To let AD play with CM Im using a workaround similar to that described in a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions17185780preventdocumentfromclosingindockingmanagerrq1Prevent document from closing in DockingManagera, where the main view code directly calls this method handling the docking manager closing event when AD is closing the document, call the underlying VM guard method and cancel if required if not cancelled, then AD goes on closing thus firing the codeDocumentClosedcode event. p  pTo see if this could work, I first created a public codeTryClosecode method in the document viewmodel base, essentially duplicating the code in the CM codeTryClosecode override, like codeIsDirtycode is a protected virtual method overridden by descendant viewmodelsp  precode    public bool CanClose              if IsDirty return true          MessageBoxAction prompt  new MessageBoxAction          ...prompt message here...           bool bResult  true         prompt.Completed  sender, args gt                      bResult  prompt.Result  MessageBoxResult.Yes                  prompt.Executenull         return bResult      codepre  pThis is the method called by the main view code behind in the handlers for AD emdocument closingem and emdocument closedemp  precode    private void OnDocumentClosingobject sender, DocumentClosingEventArgs e              DocumentBase doc  e.Document.Content as DocumentBase         if doc  null return         e.Cancel  doc.CanClose           private void OnDocumentClosedobject sender, DocumentClosedEventArgs e              DocumentBase editor  e.Document.Content as DocumentBase         if doc  null doc.TryClose      codepre  pNote that I cannot directly call codeTryClosecode in codeOnDocumentClosingcode, as this would cause null object reference errors in AD. This is really ugly but it works. I can now close documents and my guard methods are called appropriately before proceeding. Anyway, it would be nice to get suggestions for a less hacky solution here.p  h22. Hiding Toolsh2  pAnother issue arises from hiding the tools panes. In this case, AD should just hide them. The AD control visibility can be bound to an codeIsVisiblecode boolean property in my viewmodels implementing tool panes, using a codeBooleanToVisibilitycode converter. To this end I just add the binding in the XAMLp  precodeltxcadDockingManager.LayoutItemContainerStylegt     ltStyle TargetTypexType xcadLayoutItemgt         ...         ltSetter PropertyVisibility                  ValueBinding Model.IsVisible, ModeTwoWay, ConverterStaticResource BooleanToVisibilityCvtgt         ... codepre  pNow, if I hide a tool pane by clicking on its X button, I can see that my VM codeIsVisiblecode property is set to codefalsecode as expected, and the pane is hidden. Then, if I programmatically set this property back to codetruecode the pane is not shown. Even restoring the layout does not work I can see that when the application starts and the object corresponding to the hidden VM is being added to the codeToolscode collection its codeIsVisiblecode is already codefalsecode. To have it back, I must set this to codetruecode emandem then restore the layout. If I miss any of the two steps, the pane remains hidden. Clearly Im not following the intended implementation strategy here. Could anyone point me in the right directionp

I had previously accomplished this using my dispatchtimer, but this caused my program to stop responding when trying to exit.p  pRealizing that the error message codeThe calling thread must be STA, because many UI components require this.code is probably referring to the fact that I cant open a new window using my System.Timers.Timer, I tried doing the followingp  precodeprivate void timer1Tickobject sender, EventArgs e      ... other timer functions     ifconditions are met                ShowNewWindow        private static void ShowNewWindow      NewWindow nw  new NewWindow     nw.Show  codepre  pThis results in the same error message.

Negative 1914 pI am confused Recently my webhotel strongupdated phpstrong and now my old tables render special characters differently wrongly. Both my strongtables and my inputoutputphppages are set to utf8strong and since this update, also the inputs from php are treated differently now my special characters are being utf8encoded as they enter the database. So since this change, when I review tables within phpMyAdmin, the old inserts have the original nonencoded special characters  the new posts have utf8encoded charcters also special.p  pSo what I would like to do is rewrite input and output to insert and show nonencoded characters  but I am not sure if this is possible without skipping utf8 entirely in php and mySQL. But strongis there an utf8 way to submit nonencoded charactersstrongp  pAND  perhaps more fundamentally  I need to understand what the possible downsides are. I am using Danish characters in and out and Im not going to use any other language for this project. So if it IS possible to insert and output nonencoded characters using utf8  strongam I then going to have unexpecteddestructive issuesstrongp  pI have read a lot of posts regarding phpmySQLspecial characters but I havent seen this angle on the issue yet. Hope I am not duplicating I hope not because it has been working very nicely until the update.p

Negative 1914 pI have a codeUITabBarcode, with the sections, main and profile. In profile I use a background image that fills the entire screen, with a blur effect. It works pretty good. When I go back to main and go back again to profile, a new blur effect is added over the first blur effect. p  pIf I place the code corresponding to set the blur effect in codeviewDidLoadcode it works fine, the effect is added just one time. But theres a problem, the blur effect doesnt fill the entire screen. I suppose this is caused because in codeviewDidLoadcode nobody knows the frame of the codeimageViewcode, so it fills a 34 parts of the image. p  pMy question is how can I fix this supposing it is caused due to the image frame, that is unknown by now. How do I set the frame measuresp  pIf you think its caused by another thing tell me what can be.p  pthis is the blur code Im using p  precodeself.picBlurView  UIVisualEffectVieweffect self.picBlur self.picBlurView.frame  self.profileSubView.bounds     self.profileSubView.addSubviewself.picBlurView codepre  pMany thanks.p

Negative 1914 pI have a 3 Disk RAIDz1 Pool, encrypted with AES128 in GEOMELI, that I have been using in FreeNAS since version 8. There have been many zpool upgrades, and over all I am very happy with ZFS.p  pLately however I have been growing frustrated with FreeNAS. Largely many bugs that havent been fixed over the years. But overall its the emINSISTINGem on me using a Flash drive for their os, even though most of it is read only. Its still a Single point of failure and has always extended boot times by several minutes. Bottom line, I just want to use Vanilla FreeBSD with this pool. I am looking for more flexibility and a I wish to educate myself with this awesome Operating System.p  pDoing some more extended research I have found many tutorials on installing FreeBSD naively to a ZFS volume and mounting it as  It wasnt till I did more research and found an article on mounting a zfs encrypted volume as root. Later I found that FreeBSD 10 does this during installation, which is awesome to say the least.p  pa hrefhttpswww.dan.me.ukblog20120506fulldiskencryptionwithzfsrootforfreebsd9x relnofollowTutorial I usedap  pI made a VM With VMWare workstation, with three 2TB Drives, passed through as Physical Disks, and followed every step to a T and everything worked out very well. Now that I had a better grasp on the commands I was doing and why I was doing them, I wanted to do this to an already existing pool, that has a lot of data already on it. p  pBy Default, FreeNAS Creates a 2GB SWAP partition at the front of every data disk. I removed the swap space and made it 1.5GB partition on each drive with 512MB remaining for Swap. I followed through every step, changing things as needed. I have 3 disks, tutorial speaks of 4, My pool name is foxhole, the tutorial is zroot. I was successful in decrypting my volume with geomeli and mounted it successfully.p  pI did not skip any steps provided. I even copied every command I was given and altered them in a text file so they would suit my case.p  pHere is my problem now. After finally restarting to test everything, The kernel begins starting, then I am spat at a mountroot terminal. It seems that geomeli didnt make an attempt to decrypt my root volume. I have a suspicion why. Correct me if I am wrong. At the start of the tutorial, I am given commands to create new geoms for the encrypted volumep  precodegeli init b B bootzfsbootdirda0p4.eli e AESXTS K bootzfsbootdirencryption.key l 256 s 4096 devda0p4 geli init b B bootzfsbootdirda1p4.eli e AESXTS K bootzfsbootdirencryption.key l 256 s 4096 devda1p4 geli init b B bootzfsbootdirda2p4.eli e AESXTS K bootzfsbootdirencryption.key l 256 s 4096 devda2p4 codepre  pSince my volume already exists, I cant perform those commands that would have created bootzfsbootdirdaXp4.eli files.p  pI am really just guessing at this being the cause. I noticed this when i attempted to performp  precodemv bootdir.eli bootdirboot codepre  pGave me No Match.p  pI assumed those would have been created when the pool was decrypted.p  pI apologize for this post. I am trying to give as much info as I can without giving too much. I have been working on this for the last 18 hours. I would really love someone with a clear head to take a peek at this.p  pIf I missed any useful information, let me know.p
Negative 1914 pWe have a POS application we have developed that can use any ESCPOS printer via MS POS.Net v1.12. Our application runs fine with Epson printers, but with a Star TSP700 it prints correctly, but it stutterslinebyline think calling PrintNormal repeatedly rather than using a StringBuilder and dumping it all at once into the queue. Setting the dip switch to what should be ESCPOS emulation does nothing, as I dont think the USB interface supports that according to the docs found on page 98 of a hrefhttpswww.starm.jpengserviceusermanualtsp700um.pdf relnofollowhttpswww.starm.jpengserviceusermanualtsp700um.pdfa. I am building a string and dumping it all at once using Transaction printing in OPOS. The print speed to the customer is unacceptable and replacing 100 printers is also not acceptable. There is another mode we use to connect to the printer aside from OPOS, and that is setting up the printer as a Generic  Text Only printer and then I send the escape codes to the printer, but it doesnt print everything out correctly at all  I imagine this is because the printer is expecting Star Line commands.p  pPhew. Anyone have any input on what to try Worst case scenario I build in printing via Star commands, so all is not lost, and Im going to try HexDump mode first to see if I am missing anything, but I would much prefer to not write out a whole library just to handle Star printers if I can avoid it.p

For brevity in this sample, I have omitted a lot of properties so the code focuses on the essence of the problemp  precodepublic class Class1      public string Prop1  get set      public IEnumerableltClass2gt Prop2  get set      public IEnumerableltstringgt Prop3  get set        public class Class2      public string Prop4  get set    public static class FakeDatabase      public static Class1 c1instance1  new Class1  Prop1  value1,                            Prop2  new Class2[]  c2instance1 ,                            Prop3  new string[]  value3        public static Class2 c2instance1  new Class2  Prop4  Value4       public static Class1[] AllData  new Class1[]  c1instance1    codepre  pSo, my AllData of the fake database is an array of Class1 objects array of just one in this example, and Class1 objects have a string property prop1, an array of Class2 objects prop2, and an array of strings property prop3, while Class2 objects just have one string property prop4.p  pThe WebAPI controller is as basic as it getsp  precodepublic class ValuesController  ApiController        GET apivalues     public IEnumerableltClass1gt Get              return FakeDatabase.AllData                                                                                                                                                                                             codepre  pBut when I invoke the Values controller, the result is  p  precodeltArrayOfClass1 xmlnsihttpwww.w3.org2001XMLSchemainstance xmlnshttpschemas.datacontract.org200407FakeDataService.Modelsgt ltClass1gt ltProp1gtvalue1ltProp1gt ltProp2gt ltClass2 iniltruegt ltProp2gt ltProp3 xmlnsd3p1httpschemas.microsoft.com200310SerializationArraysgt ltd3p1stringgtvalue3ltd3p1stringgt ltProp3gt ltClass1gt ltArrayOfClass1gt codepre  pNotice how the serialization of the Class2 object yields iniltruep  pAfter a good few hours of searching My example data was a LOT bigger than this simple sample here, I found that the root of the problem was the fact that the array of nested objects are defined as static instances. Eg. Change the initial code of FakeDatabase to     p  precodepublic static class FakeDatabase              public static Class1 c1instance1  new Class1  Prop1  value1,                  Prop2  new Class2[]  new Class2  Prop4  Value4 ,                 Prop3  new string[]  value3             public static Class1[] AllData  new Class1[]  c1instance1    codepre  pInvoking the WebAPI controller now gives me correctly p  precodeltArrayOfClass1 xmlnsihttpwww.w3.org2001XMLSchemainstance xmlnshttpschemas.datacontract.org200407FakeDataService.Modelsgt ltClass1gt ltProp1gtvalue1ltProp1gt ltProp2gt ltClass2gt ltProp4gtValue4ltProp4gt ltClass2gt ltProp2gt ltProp3 xmlnsd3p1httpschemas.microsoft.com200310SerializationArraysgt ltd3p1stringgtvalue3ltd3p1stringgt ltProp3gt ltClass1gt ltArrayOfClass1gt codepre  pSo the only difference is the array of Class2 objects. What could be the explanation of this behavior   p

However, what I want to do is add an object returned from scope.fClick to scope.output only if there isnt an object in output already with the same property name value. So right now in my implementation both code name English,    ticked false   code and code   name English,    ticked true    code get added to the array. Instead I want it to update the ticked property. So, for instance if if codescope.output     name English,    ticked false   code and then scope.fClick returns   name English,    ticked true. When I push this value to scope.output I want it to the update the existing objects tick property so codescope.output      name English,    ticked false   code becomes codescope.output     name English,    ticked true    code p  pThis is what I have triedp  precodescope.fClick  function data                                        scope.x  data                                  scope.watchfunction                   return scope.y  scope.x                 ,function newValue, oldValue                      var id  scope.output.indexOfnewValue                     ifid  1                         scope.output.pushnewValue                                                  else                          scope.output[id].tick  newValue.tick                                          console.logscope.output              ,true codepre  pHow do I make this workp

Negative 1914 pI am struggling with concept of singletons in dependency injection.

On the other hand if programmer do not mark class as strongSingleInstancestrong there will be an issue when saving because if it will be implemented as replacing whole collection in storage place not all settings will be saved. Thus correct functionality strongly depends on programmer knowledge of class and using it as singleton.p  pIn second example I am using static field for Settings which allows me to use class as singleton or as instancing per instance without effecting core functionality I mean that not all settings will be saved if more instances of ApplicationSettings2 will be usedp  precode ltsummarygt  This allows to create many ApplicationSettings2 instances which each of them will share same collection of settings.   ltsummarygt public class ApplicationSettings2      private static readonly object Locker  new object     private static readonly Dictionaryltstring, objectgt Settings     private readonly ILog log      static ApplicationSettings2              Settings  LoadSettings         Thread.Sleep3000 inner hardwork, e.g. cashing of something            public ApplicationSettings2ILog log              log  log           public object GetSettingsstring key              lock Locker                      return Settings.ContainsKeykey  Settings[key]  null                    public void SetSettingsstring key, object value              lock Locker                      Settings.Removekey             Settings.Addkey, value                    public void Removestring key              lock Locker                      Settings.Removekey                    public void Save              Thread.Sleep5000 Saving somewhere           private static Dictionaryltstring, objectgt LoadSettings              Thread.Sleep5000         return new Dictionaryltstring, objectgt       codepre  pBoth approach of class usagep  precode... builder.RegisterTypeltApplicationSettingsgt.AsSelf.SingleInstance ... codepre  porp  precode... builder.RegisterTypeltApplicationSettingsgt.AsSelf ... codepre  pwill lead to same expected functionality.

Figuring out the exact postage for each destination with the available values and finding solutions with low stocks of certain values is a nottrivial process, if you consider six different destinationbasedpostages and hundreds of letters to mail.p  pThere are other modules which help turning the theoretical optimum solution into something that can actually be purchased on any given day, by strategic dialogguidance...p  pAbout my dictionary in this question I iterate over all reasonable high enough to make the needed postage and only overpaying up to a fraction of one stamp combinations of stampvalues.  p  pThen I calculate a success value, which is based on the number of stamps needed priority, the number of types needed lower prioritybecause purchasing different stamps takes extra time at the counter and a very high penalty for payingover. So lowest value means highest success.p  pI collect all reasonable solutions in a dictionary where the tuple of neededstamps serves as the key, and another tuple of some resultsdata makes up the values. It is mildly overdefined because a human needs to read it at this phase in the project for debugging.p  pIf you are curious and want to read the example first linebr The colums are  p  ul linumber of stamps of 350 cents li linumber of stamps of 200 cents li linumber of stamps of 50 centsli linumber of stamps of 25 centsli lievaluationscoreli licalculated applied postageli litotal number of stamps appliedli litotal number of stamptypesli lioverpayment in cents if anyli ul  pstrongOr in wordsstrong Assuming a postal service is offering existing stamps of 350, 200, 50 and 25 cents, I can apply postage of 75 cents by using 1x 50 cents and 1x 25 cents. This gives me a successrating of 22 the best in this list, postage is 75 cents, needing two stamps of two different values and having 0 cents overpayment.p
Negative 1914 pI parse some data in Json format to android application from url, I created a clickable listview and now I want to create a shopping cart...

Negative 1914 pWhat is relevant when you think about separating a project into several repositories or keeping it in a single repository with separated foldersp  pIn a project with several different parts, those separated repositories would target the following componentsp  ul liData structuresli liCore functionalityli liSort of plugins family one for eachli liDifferent backends for some components one for eachli ul  pAlso considering the option of making a github organisation to store those repositories, because a few of them would be somehow dependant on others. Furthermore, that would help in keeping the personal accout clear.p  pIve seen all sort of approaches when looking at other projects from using one big repository to separated small ones. Im considering going the fragmented way because its somehow more organised, but it might be an overkill if those parts are not too big.p
