Negative 69665 pI have a very fundamental understanding problem with Rails page caching mechanism.p  pOn a rails 2.0.5 application, I use a lot of full page caching, everythings working fine, pages are served at great speed by apache.p  pSo far all the content was handled in an admin section, the cache sweepers are working well.p  pBut I have now opened the edition of some sections to the users, who dont go through the admin namespace, but the regular routes.p  pthe problem is that it seems when the updates are performed, they dont go to mongrel with the put action, instead I just get the cached page no action in the database, no flash message, no nothing....p  pI feel like I missed something here, is it possible to use page caching with regular REST routes  or do I have a problem with my mongrelapache configuration p  pEDITp  pthanks for your answer, but it is not what I meant, the full page cache mechanism works fine, I have dedicated sweepers in the admin controllers that refresh the pages.p  pmy problem is or I think it is that when the models are updated through the regular controllers, the form is submitted to the cached page and not to the appropriate action.p  pin the formp  ppages1helloeditbr form should be posted with put method  on pages1hello  p  pbut I believe it goes to the cached page pages1hello.html and is treated as a regular get.... p  pWhen I submit the form, I just see the show action, no flash message, nothing updated. then I erase the  cached file in my public directory, submit the form again and suddenly everything works....  p  pI read the cache section in the rails way and the tutorial on railsenvy.com but I never seen anything mentionned about cached pages that would bring such problems....p

Negative 69665 pCheers,p  pafter seeing Stack Overflows excellent implementation of OpenID, and after seeing what great job Google did with OpenID, I implemented it on a web app Im working on. During my research I ran into Plaxo as another great RP.p  pRecently, Facebook added some rudimentary OpenID support. Its apparently used for completely different purposes that ordinarily I didnt find a way to ilog ini with OpenID there. Yet, theres one thing that caught my attention on Googlehosted UI, they had a Facebook logo, and a bit different heading. At first I thought this might be because of the new popup extension recently designed precisely because of Facebook. However I edited the authorization URL and removed reference to the popup extension, and the icon was still there. When I wrote the extension support, it didnt add the icon.p  pI looked around, and Plaxos got their icon on Googles auth page as well. p  pAlthough this might be a result of business deal between Google and Plaxo, and Google and Facebook, it might not be the case. So I am wondering Does anyone have idea how to add this iconp  pin.b.

So Ill open a new one.p  h1Please readh1  pOkay okay. I strongknowstrong that regexes are not the way to parse general HTML. Please take note that the created documents are written using a limited, controlled HTML subset. And people writing the docs know what theyre doing. They are all IT professionalsp  pGiven the controlled syntax it emisem possible to parse the documents I have here using regexes.p  pI am not trying to download arbitrary documents from the web and parse themp  pAnd if the parsing emdoesem fail, the document is edited, so itll parse. The problem I am addressing here is more general than that i.e. not replace patterns inside two other patterns.p  h1A little bit of background you can skip this...h1  pIn our office we are supposed to pretty print our documentation. Hence why some came up with putting it all into Word documents. So far were thankfully not quite there yet. And, if I get this done, we might not need to.p  h2The current state ... and thish2  pThe main part of the docs are stored in a TikiWiki database. Ive created a daft PHP script which converts the documents from HTML via LaTeX to PDF. One of the emmust haveem features of the selected WikiSystem was a WYSIWYG editor. Which, as expected leaves us with documents with a less then formal DOM.p  pConsequently, I am transliterating the document using simple regexes. It all works mostly fine so far, but I encountered one problem I havent figured out on my own yet.p  h1The problemh1  pSome special characters need to replaced by LaTeX markup. For exaple, the codecode character should be replaced by codebackslashcode unless someone knows another solution.p  pemExceptem while in a codeverbatimcode blockp  pI do replace codeltcodegtcode tags with codeverbatimcode sections. But if this codecodecode block contains backslashes as is the case for Windows folder names, the script still replaces these backslashes.p  pI reckon I could solve this using negative LookBehinds andor LookAheads. But my attempts did not work.p  pGranted, I would be better off with a real parser. In fact, it is something on my inbrainroadmap, but it is emcurrentlyem out of the scope.

Negative 69665 pHere is my use casep  pI start on a project XYZ, for which I create a work item, and I make frequent checkins, easily 1020 in total. ALL of the code changes will be coderead and codereviewed.p  pThe change sets are not consecutive  other people checkin inbetween my changes, although they are very unlikely to touch the exact same files.p  pSo ... at the end of the project I am interested in a total diff  as if there was a single checkin by me to complete the entire project. In theory this is computable. From the list of change sets associated with the work item, you get the list of all files that were affected. Then, the algorithm can aggregate individual diffs over each file and combine them into one. It is possible that a pure total diff is uncomputable due to the fact that someone else renamed files, or changed stuff around very closely, or in the same functions as me. I that case ... I suppose a total diff can include those changes by nonme as well, and warn me about the fact.p  pI would find this very useful, but I do not know how to do t in practice. Can Visual Studio 20082010 andor TFS server do it Are there other source control systems capable of doing thisp  pThanks.p

Negative 69665 pI am not sure if this is Java behaviour or rogue GWT behaviour. But here goes.p  pI have a class for 2D vectors, called Vector2. In my program I do some simulation of 2D particles represented by instances of this class. I have two arrays of Vector2, mx and moldx that are members of another class, with a function that does some processing. Part of this function is the following, and Im awfully confused by its behaviourp  precodeVector2 old  mx[i]  Vector2 test  new Vector29.0f,9.0f mx[i]  test   1 at this point, mx[i]s values are 9.0,9.0 moldx[i]  old  2 at this point, mx[i]s values are 100.0,100.0  their original values before I assigned test to mx[i] codepre  pSo basically, it appears that by virtue of the fact that I assign old to the moldx array, mx[i]s value gets reset to its original value Its no longer equal to the test variable I assigned to it earlier.p  pSurely that cant be right But this is whats happening for me. I should say again that I am using GWT here  i.e. this code gets compiled down to Javascript by Googles compiler. Is this regular java behaviour or is GWT doing something wrong Thanks for any help...tearing my hair out p

Negative 69665 pI have a C Win32 application that was written as a Windows GUI project, and now Im trying to figure out to make it into a Service  GUI hybrid.  I understand that a Windows Service cannot  should not have a user interface.  But allow me to explain what I have so far and what Im shooting for.p  pstrongWHAT I HAVE NOWstrong is a windows application. When it is run it places an icon in the system tray that you can doubleclick on to open up the GUI. The purpose of this application is to process files located in a specified directory on a nightly schedule. The GUI consists of the followingp  ul liA button to start an unscheduled scanprocess manually.li liA button to open a dialog for modifying settings.li liA List Box for displaying status messages sent from the processing thread.li liA custom drawn window for displaying image data the file processing includes the creation and saving of images.li liA status bar  while a process is not running, it shows a countdown to the next scheduled scan. During a scan it also provides some status feedback, including a progress bar.li ul  pstrongWHAT IM SHOOTING FORstrong is a service that will run on bootup and not require a user to login. This would consist of the scheduled file processing. However, when a user logs in I would still like the tray icon to be loaded and allow them to open up a GUI as I described above to monitor the current state of the service, change settings, start a scan manually, and monitor the progress of a scan.p  pIm sure that I have seen applications like this  that function as a service even when Im not logged in, but still give me a user interface to work with once I do log in.p  pIm thinking that instead of having a single multithreaded application that sends messages to the GUI thread from the processing thread, I need two applications  a Service to perform the processing and a GUI application to provide visual feedback from the Service and also send messages to the Service for example, to start a scan manually. But I am new to Windows Services and have no idea how this is done.p  pIt is also possible that Im completely off base and a Service is not what Im looking for at all.p  pAny help  ideas  suggestions would be greatly appreciated  Thank you.p

The ampamp has higher precedence than print, so thats evaluated first and then its printed.

However this doesnt really make sense.p  pIve read the Perl documentation on how precedence works for list operators, but I still do not understand this example.

Negative 69665 pHey guys, sorry for beating the memory management deadhorse again. I know this question has been asked several times on SO, but I feel all the threads out there is still lacking two pieces of information. Let me put forth what I DO know to save everyone some time.p  p1 When you create an IBOutlet, your view controller automatically retains this outlet.p  p1a When you dont create an outlet, the frameworkthe nib releases your objectslike uilabels or uiviews for you.p  p2 When you do self.myOutlet  nil, you effectively release an outletproviding that you have synthesized your properties correctly. This is because the setter releases the outlet and assigns it to nil.p  pWhat I dont knowp  p1 The MAIN question If you do self.myOutlet  nil in viewDidUnLoad, do you still need to do anything in dealloc Can you make the assumption that viewDidUnload always called before deallocand therefore your retained views are releasedp  p2 If you dont synthesize a property for that outlet, what happens Shouldnt the framework release it automaticallysince you dont have a retain property If you do have to release it, how do you do it and wherein viewDidUnload or deallocp  pIf anything is wrong, please point it out to me. Any clarifications at all would be very helpful.p

Negative 69665 pI am a JSCSSHTML noob, but I think this one is a bit of a doozy.p  pIm using Kwicks for JQuery Example 3 a hrefhttpwww.jeremymartin.nameexampleskwicks.phpexample3 relnofollowhttpwww.jeremymartin.nameexampleskwicks.phpexample3a as a main menu, and using mouseover on them, I show .style.displayblock a previously hidden  that contains CSSdriven submenus httpwww.dynamicdrive.comstylecsslibraryitemnestedsidebarmenu.p  pThat works great until the user moves the mouse off of the Kwicks for JQuery K4JQ main menu, at which point the div stays open if the user goes back over the main menu, onto another menu item, the submenu div will close, but another submenu will spawn, which once again, wont close  in other words, one menu is open at all times.p  pIf I put a .style.displaynone statement onto the mouseleave function of the K4JQ menu, then this goes off as soon as the mouse leaves the main menu, whether it be moving off the menu system completely desired effect or moving onto the submenus obviously not the desire effect. I obviously need the submenus to hide if the user does not move from the main menu to the submenus, opting to move the mouse elsewhere, but obviously not being able to actually use the submenus since they hide as soon as you move over them was not exactly what I was looking for.p  pSolutions to fix this that I have come up with arep  p1 Getting the mouse coordinates in K4JQ mouseleave function, and if the mouse is inside the left,top, leftwidth, topheight bounding box of the submenu, then skip the step in the K4JQ mouseleave function that hides the submenu otherwise do not skip it and hide the menu. That will leave the submenu open only if the mouse moved from the K4JQ menu onto the submenu, so I could then put the .style.displaynone code into the mouseleave function of the submenu itself, which will allow the submenu to be closed as soon as the user moves off of it.p  p2 Trying to use a global variable, which would be altered by the submenu onmouseover function assuming that it runs first  does it, that will tell the K4JQ main menu mouseleave function to leave the submenu div open. Once again, the submenus onmouseover function would be relied upon to close out the submenu and also reset the global variable.p  p3 Other solutions that you guys can come up with.p  pOut of the options 1 and 2, I am more fond of 1 since Im not sure that 2 will work at all since the K4JQ menus mouseleave function probably fires off before the submenus onmouseover function. However, Im hoping that you guys are better programmers than I am and have some awesome advice for me.p  pThanks for any help that you can providep

So there would be a birthday button and it should display the number of birthdays within the next two weeks or a button with the number of upcoming events.  Any thoughts on how best to do this  Thanks.p  pWadep  pClarificationp  pThere is no code yet, just some requirements.  What I am doing is querying a table to get the list of buttons to display.  Now each of these buttons may have dynamic text, for things like count of birthdays, events,etc...  I am trying to see what the best way would be to handle this.  Should I embed a snippet of code to go along with the menu item to execute when I iterate over the menu items  Maybe I should build a javascript file to go along with the code, which I add code to query a service for certain menu items  Thanks for any help.p
Negative 69665 pA web application works with the database. Once a day, the database should be scanned and alerts should be sent to users. p  pFrom what Ive seen out there, additional project has to be created which will be installed on the server and will work with the same database.

Negative 69665 pI have a halfdozen apps installed on my iPhone via Xcodes Build and Run function, and theyve always been unaffected by syncing the phone with iTunes. Now one of the apps has started disappearing from the iPhone every time I sync with iTunes. If I watch the sync progress at the top of the iTunes window, I can see the step where it says Removing Appname.p  pIf I connect the iPhone and browse its sync settings, on the Apps tab, the app icon is visible on the home screen, but it does not appear in the Sync Apps list where I can check which apps to sync. Oddly, if I put the app into a folder, and iTunes removes it, and then I reinstall it from Xcode, it will go back into that same folder.p  pThe only difference I can think of between this app and the others is that this was originally an iPadonly app, and then I changed it to an iPhoneiPad app. The app does work fine on the phone until iTunes removes it. Ive confirmed that iPhoneiPad is selected for the Targeted Device Family setting for all configurations. Ive also tried removing the development provisioning profile from the phone and reinstalling it.p  pDoes anyone know why iTunes would be removing this app even though it leaves the others alonep

Negative 69665 pWe have a distributed system in which a Javabased server cache communicates with a C front end, currently through object serialization.p  pOne nice to have feature that weve been kicking around for a while is the idea that when the server representation of an object changes, i.e. we add a new attribute, we shouldnt have to release an update for the frontend as well. Right now thats obviously not a possibility  you change the structure of an object, you change its serialized form, and the deserialization doesnt work or at best captures only what it is used to picking up and no new fields.p  pI was wondering if anyone had encountered a similar problem before, and what sort of solutions they went through for solving it One bright spark in the office has suggested we send XML to the client and it should directly build the UI from what is contained within that message  no construction of an object in between  but that of course brings its own problems.p  pAll advice welcome p  pCheers,p  pDave.p

Negative 69665 pI am building an interface whose primary function would be to act as a file renaming tool the underlying task here is to manually classify each file within a folder according to rules that describe their content. So far, I have implemented a customized file explorer and a preview window for the files. p  pI now have to find a way to inform a user if a file has already been renamed this will show up in the file explorers listView. The program should be able to read as well as modify that state as the files are renamed. I simply do not know what method is optimal to save this kind of information, as I am not fully used to Cs potential yet.

Negative 69665 pI want to create a go executable which communicates with xen through its native interface. There is a C shared library actually 2 for this purpose and I created a simple go wrapper with cgo.p  pThe problem is that I want to target 3 xen versions 3.2, 3.4, 4.0, each of which has a different shared library. The library itself provides basically the same API, but the sizes and shape of the structs defined in the C header are different, and thus the same compiled go binary cannot be used with these different shared libraries.p  pI want to have a go binary holding the main and a go pkg which is the wrapper for xen.p  pI was thinking about 2 solutionsp  ol lipI could build 3 different versions of the compiled pkg and also 3 different versions of the main binary each linked with the corresponding pkg version.  This solution requires building manually the makefiles so that I can pass the correct paths etcpli lipI could build a thin C wrapper as a shared library and build it in 3 versions against the 3 versions of xen C bindings. This C wrapper would then export a stable C interface which is then used by one single go pkg. Then I can deploy the correct C wrapper shared library to the hosts and have it resolve at runtimepli ol  pIs there any other way to handle that  I would prefer using pure cgo code but I dont like the additional burden of maintaining complicated makefiles.p  pEDIT More details about why I feel uncomfortable about handling that manually in the makefilesp  pFor example the name of the obj dir is hardcoded in Make.inc and company, and these makefiles rely on some generated .c files containing special information about the name of the shared library, which I have to cleanup before building the next version of the pkg. A snipped of my makefile p  precodeall     rm f obj     MAKE f Makefile.common XENVERSION3.0     rm f obj     MAKE f Makefile.common XENVERSION3.4     rm f obj     MAKE f Makefile.common XENVERSION4.0 codepre  pwhere Makefile.common basically is a normal pkg makefile which uses codeTARGXENVERSIONviminixencode, as I cannot encode the version in the package name because Id have to modify the imports in the source. p  pBy encoding the version in the package directory I can use codeGCIMPORTSI....pkgxenobjXENVERSIONcode to select the right une from the main cmds Makefile.p  pOf course I could roll out my own makefile which invokes 6c and 6l, cgo etc, but I prefer to leverage the existing make infrastructure since it seems that there is some wisdom in it.p

Negative 69665 pIm creating a class that will manage a connection to a Firebird database.  The Firebird Service will be installed to facilitate multiple connections to the database.  Unfortunately, the environments where my software will deploy can be volatile, and I cant always guarantee that the Firebird Service will be running when I attempt to connect, or that it will continue to run after Ive established a connection.p  pIn the interest of centralizing error handling, Ive made the decision that disparate parts of my code wont directly work with database cursors in any way. Instead, Ill expose codequerycode and codedmlcode methods from my Connection Manager. This works, to an extend, given the code below some code not included for brevity.p  precodeclass DBConnectionobject    self.conn is an instance of kinterbasdb.connect   def queryself, query, params  None     cursor  self.conn.cursor      if params       cursor.executequery, params     else       cursor.executequery      return [[x[0].title for x in cursor.description]]  [r for r in cursor.fetchall]    def dmlself, query, params  None     cursor  self.conn.cursor      if params       cursor.executequery, params     else       cursor.executequery      self.conn.commit codepre  pThe trouble manifests when the Firebird Service stops or is unreachable for some reason.  I would expect that codeself.conn.cursorcode would throw an exception, which would make it simple to do something like thisp  precodeclass DBConnectionobject    self.conn is an instance of kinterbasdb.connect   def cursorself     try       return self.conn.cursor     except        Error handling code here, possibly reconnect, display alert.    def queryself, query, params  None     cursor  self.cursor    def dmlself, query, params  None     cursor  self.cursor codepre  pUnfortunately, there is no exception thrown when I request a cursor.

Negative 69665 pWhat is the best way to handle a function that might occasional fail to evaluate, but even when it does fail does not require a halt of the parent routine, though sometimes might require an explanation to the userp  pI have such a function, deep in my code, that returns a number.  Codingwise, the simplest approach would be to make the function nullable, and return null when it cant evaluate.  That way the calling routine can continue while also knowing the function failed to return a number.  p  pHowever, depending upon the circumstances, sometimes I want to display the reason for the fail to the user so they know what to fix.  Obviously just returning null isnt enough information.  Should I be raising messages inside the function itself as it evaluates for anonymous listeners to catch, to be displayed if desiredbr For those rightfully pointing out that logic functions shouldnt be responsible for creating user messages, I didnt mean to imply the function generates the full text message, just somehow transmits the reason for the problem so that the UI could later parse that into a messagep  pThe other option I suppose would be throw exceptions inside the function if it cant evaluate, then catch and interpret to user messages if desired.  However, as stated the inability to evaluate typically does not signify a halt to the routine, and now Id have to put a Try...Catch block around the function call everytime I use it.p

Negative 69665 pRelative newbie question.  My app has a simple NSMutableArray of NSNumbers.  about a dozen integers Id like my UI to have a view displaying the numbers so that the user knows whats in the array.  I want the contents of the view to be current, so I think I want a binding to the array or its contents.  Is there a simple way to do thisp  pI think I can figure this out if I change my model so that the NSMutableArray contains a custom class having a setter and getter to a declared property following Lucas YouTubtorial on NSTableView bindings, but I would think that there might be a simpler way, one that allows me to use my array of NSNumbers.  Id have to do a fair amount of editing if I have to redo my NSMutableArray.  Thanks ...p

Negative 69665 pIm starting a new project and want a onestep build process for my development, continuous integration, and production servers.p  pIll want the process to be included in my source control gitgithub, and to run robustly on any of my three servers, which are pretty similar, but do have different paths for the project root.p  pI had planned to use Phing, PHPDocumentor, PHPCodeSniffer, PHPUnit, etc. installed via Pyrus into a localized PEARPEAR2 install that could be deployed along with the project, so I could be confident in my dependencies at build time.p  pHowever, Ive had nothing but problems with getting this set up.p  pThis is the first time Ive tried to set up such a build system, and nix installs arent my strong point though I always do end up with a reliable system eventually, so the weak link here may be me.  However, a lot of the problems Im having seem to come from PEAR.  p  pFor example, no matter how carefully I install via pyrus, everything ends up having path issues.  Looking into some of the PEAR packages, all paths are hard coded probably set at runtime with the relative paths I used during install .pear, etc..  This means I can only successfully run the packages from the folder where pyrus was during install, even though the run scrips were put in .pearbin and I did set the bin folder during install.  Sometimes the paths conflict internally to a single package, so it wants to run from here, but it wants to manage the config from over there...p  pPHPDocumentor doesnt handle PHP5.3 and wont run for me at all, maybe because it has issues, maybe because Ive misinstalled it, so Ive replaced it with PHPDoctor which initially seems pretty good.p  pAnother example, after setup, Phing will run, but just dies silently.  After digging in and tracing it, I find that an obscure function on line 70 of ioPhingFile is getting null for a required arg, which throws a ConfigurationException which causes it to die silently.p  pIm confident that I can get all this working ok, but Im NOT confident that it will ever be a deployable robust system, and I really dont want to have to debug, tweak, and then maintain a big pile of selfmodified PEAR packages that have to be retweaked at every upgrade.p  pSo, finally the question op  pDoes anyone have a really good robust build system using these apps  Was there some trick to it  p  pOr does emeveryoneem have a nice robust build system and its just my naivete with nix installs and system config that makes this all seem like a doublesized helping of clusterphuckeryp  pDoes anyone have any pointers on getting such a system set up to work across multiple servers, or am I just kidding myself  Maybe I should just do separate installs on the systems outside the project root and get on with my developmentp

Negative 69665 pWe just got a idea to show the power of mobile web to clients. So we were thinking to show clients website in mobile. So its obvious that we wont get access to client code or website. The client website is in PHP. So is there any external tool or application that we can use to configure the website on mobile, with out getting the actual code. Like we have a hrefhttpkurogo.orghome relnofollowKurogoa . But i found that the amount of effort needed in configuring it for a website is too much. So is there any simple tool which we can use. It should just handle images, links and basic content. Just take it and display properly in mobilep

Negative 69665 pI am attempting to modify a GPL program written in C. My goal is to replace one method with a CUDA implementation, which means I need to compile with nvcc instead of gcc.

Honestly, this is my first time doing anything in C in a long time, including anything involving gcc or g, so Im pretty lost.p  pIm not super interested in learning configure and Makefiles  this is more of an experiment.

Please shatter my 2.10 dreams or enlighten me as to what new avenues are opening with the highly anticipated release of Scala.Nextp  pAlso, in regard to case classes, it seems for validationcreation, scalaz validation is the goto weapon of choice. It seems quite wonderful, acting as a safe proxy for object creation or as an error collector. As a Scewbie, however, I find scalaz somewhat challenging, and am resisting the Fing dark side despite its obvious power p  pAt any rate, the point here is, with 2.10 reflection we should be able to bind at runtime the fields from say, a form post, to the properties of a case class and perform basic validation based on property type alone i.e. will not have to specify separate validation logic that specifies property foo must be a String since its type is already defined in the case class upon which we can now properly reflectp  pSo, brave new world cometh, or existing tools are the mainstay for the foreseeable futurep

Negative 69665 pI would like to start a community discussion.  As per my question, when do you decide to stop supporting older browsersp  pIve nearly completed the development of a large personal application. It uses a lot of HTML5, CSS3 and JavaScript. If I were to support older browsers, I would estimate that it would increase my front end work load by at least 50. And to be frank, I dont want to support the older browsers.  From a business point of view, one could argue that if I dont, I could lose revenue. I disagree.  I feel that the customers who use older browsers wouldnt be the customers I would want anyway  they would be the ones giving me more work as Id have to fix compatibility problems in my application to work with their old browser or have to continually tell them to upgrade their browser. If the web is to move on, then people need to stop supporting the older browsers, however, I do see that the tide is slowly starting to turn towards this.p  pRecently, IE6 was pronounced dead. When can we safely say that IE7 and IE8 or indeed Firefox 3 can longer be considered as important enough to support p  pFurthermore, I hear a lot of people say on this site make sure it degrades gracefully so itll still work with browsers that dont have JavaScript support What kind of browsers now dont have JavaScript support Mostly old phones  and if these old phones dont support JavaScript then I highly doubt that they will parse the HTML correctly either. I also have a Sencha touch mobile version of my application. Am I going to make a WAP version of it to support older phones No. Its a rich web app. Thats how it has designed to be and thats how I intend for it to stay.p  pI rather like Apples approach If you upgrade your OS, dont expect your apps from the previous of the OS to work with the new one. Yes, it can be a frustration, but it means there is less of a mess overrall and people are forced to upgrade to move along with the times.p  pIt works the same way for new web apps, if I want to keep them clean, quick and efficient, I need to stop hacking the code to support legacy software and if users dont like it, they can move on from my site or join the rest of us and upgrade their browser and have a better web experience.p  pI dont want this to come across as arrogant, but I am genuinely interested in your opinions when you consider enough is enough and only support recent browsers.p

Negative 69665 pI am confused about where I put a dependency property when building a WPF application using the MVVM pattern.  Does it go in the Model or the ViewModelp  h2Edith2  pAfter looking at early answers thanks for those, I find that I am still confused, so I am giving more detail to help someone explain this to me.p  pI have a class called Station.  It is used by surveyors and civil engineers to represent the length along a road.  For the most part, a Station is just a double, but it has a few decorations.  First off, the format is different.  When distance along is greater than 100 feet, we add a  symbol as another way to format it.  So 1234.56 feet down the road we might have Station 1234.56.  I will skip the other decorations since this one is good enough for my point.p  pThus the logic for the special formatting lives in Station, a class in the Model.  I want a TextBox in the View to take user input of 1234.56 and coerce it to a text value of 1234.56.  So I want a TextBox to give the user access to a value in the Model, so it needs to be a dependency property.  That is correct, isnt it  But the business logic for coercingparsingunderstanding how to go back and forth between a TextBox and a Station should live in the Station class.  Rightp  pFurthermore, I will later want to give the user the ability to set the station value by clicking on a graphical drawing of the road, including dynamically updating the value as the mouse moves and locking the value in upon issuing a data point.  Now you see why I tried to keep this brief.p  pSo is this not something that I would want to make a dependency property, especially with the dynamic data point possibly getting involved later  If not, how do I hook a text box item to a station using MVVM  I really have researched this a lot before asking my question, but with no success.p  ul liPaulli ul

Negative 69665 pI understand how floats can be useful to position elements beside each other and essentially shrinktofit, but how would one go about achieving a table like appearancep  precodeColumn 1                Column 2                Column 3 Column 4 Bigger         Column 5                Column 6 codepre  pNotice how the first set of columns adjusts to fit the length of the largest element So if column 4 is wider than 1, 1 will automatically be wider So far the only way I can achieve this is by using display table and display tablecell, but its a little flaky because I have to set specific widths etc. Unless im doing something wrong, maybe tables are somehow the best way to do this sort of thing...in an otherwise tableless web.p

Negative 69665 pI create thousands of PDF files per day and print them on a set of HP4515 printers using a Ruby on Rails app with Prawn. After a couple of years of production printing, I noticed yet another HP anomaly today a simple 47kB 10page file of tables causes the HP printer to pause for several seconds between pages. the tables do not span pages.p  pI have a custom print spooler that ensures certain bundles of documents are printed coherently from submissions in a call center, and this spooler logs how many bytes are written into the printers port 9100 socket.  Oddly, this 47kB file logs 6,442kB of bytes sent 137 times, and it takes 71 seconds.  Most socket writes of 50kB files take only a few milliseconds, unless the printer gets backed up and I have several techniques of throttling my file writes to avoid bogging the printers down, which improves throughput.  This throttling only delays between files, not within them.p  pThe multiple pages are created using Prawns pdf.startnewpage.  Viewing the PDF in OSXs Skim or Preview shows nothing unexpected.p  pNone of my other 100 PDF file types cause this strange printerpause, although almost all of the other file types are single page.p  pAll other socket.writestr calls actually send the number of bytes in the file.p  pThe files have proprietary court case information, so I cant just attach a sample.  If anyone has a suggestion, perhaps I could create a similar file using nonsense data....p  pBTW  I have found HPs support useless, despite the amount we pay for it.p
Negative 69665 pI apologize if this is an easy question and I was just googling the wrong keywords. Its been a few years since Ive used Joomla but got handed a site to make some changes to, that someone else originally developed and cant seem to figure out whats going on.  Im running Joomla v1.5.26.p  pIm trying to add a blog section to the site, so I created a blog section and category and then I created a new Category Blog Layout in my menu and set the Columns value to 3 img srchttpi.stack.imgur.comnCX8r.png altCategory Blog Layout Settingsp  pHowever, whenever I view the page, it keeps showing 2 columns. So I went to phpMyAdmin and found the menu in josmenu and confirmed that the database did in fact get updated img srchttpi.stack.imgur.comdoRDf.png altenter image description herep  pSo next I opened up componentscomcontentviewscategorytmplblog.php and added this to to the top of the PHP file to see what values were being loadedp  precodeltphp print ltpregt printrthisgtparams print ltpregt gt codepre  pWhich produced the following results on the front endp  precode     ...      [numleadingarticles] gt 1      [numintroarticles] gt 4      [numcolumns] gt 2      [numlinks] gt 4      ... codepre  pSo for some reason, even though Ive set the values to update, and they do in fact update in the database, they are not updating on the front end.  Ive tried clearing the cache and all that fun stuff, without much luck. If it was just numcolumns having an issue I could probably just override that functionality.  However, it appears to be doing the same thing with all of the parameters, not just number of columns.  Im just using that as an example. p  pI havent ruled out the possibility that its a conflict with some thirdparty plugin yet, but am trying to see if maybe Im missing something obvious and someone can point me in the right direction.p  pstrongUPDATE 12412strongp  pSo it appears to be a conflict with the sh404sef plugin. Im not exactly sure what the deal is quite yet, but when I disable the plugin it works fine, but it happens again once I reenable it.  Now to see if I can figure out whats wrong with the plugin.p

I understand that we can set an error handler for the Validator in which I can skip such errors, but this means that I need to perform the semantic checks in my application code. p  pOne solution that I can think of is it to parse the XSD and get the set of restrictions such as timestamp format, length checks etc and then while parsing the XML check these restrictions. Is there any elegant or well defined way of solving this problemp
Negative 69665 pSee edit at the bottom.p  pMy company has a huge code base and we want to start using knockout more effectively. However, we have validation code in place already that takes care of all aspects of clientside validation. It uses jQuery to show validation error messages and to sanitize user input. p  pFor example, if I add the class validaterange to an input, it will use jQuery changefocusout events to track changes and then if a value is out of the range, it will replace it with the minmax value using input.val. Since this validation code makes changes this way programmatically, my knockout view model wont be updated when these kind of changes are made.p  pThis validation code is used everywhere in the system, and cant be replaced at the moment, so in order to use knockout, I have to make it work along side this code. What ive tried so far is creating a custom value binding that adds an additional change event handler which is used to update the view model whenever the validation code changes an inputs value. p  pThis works surprisingly well in all cases except inside a foreach binding which is the same as using the templatewith binding I would imagine. My change event handler isnt being fired on any inputs inside the foreach that use the custom value binding, even though the custom binding is being reapplied to all inputs inside the foreach every time the observable array changes.p  pI was hoping someone has dealt with this problem before, having to make knockout work with existing javascript code that changes DOM values, and thus doesnt update the view model. Any help is greatly appreciated.p  pJavascript code for custom binding, creating view model, and old validation codep  precode custom value binding for amounts ko.bindingHandlers.amountValue     init function element, valueAccessor      var underlyingObservable  valueAccessor,          interceptor  ko.computed           read function               var value  underlyingObservable             return formatAmountvalue           ,            write function newValue              var current  underlyingObservable,                 valueToWrite  parseAmountnewValue              if valueToWrite  current               underlyingObservablevalueToWrite             else if newValue  current.toString               underlyingObservable.valueHasMutated                           i apply a change event handler when applying the bindings which calls the write function of the interceptor.      the intention is to have the change handler be called anytime the old validation code changes an input boxs value via       input.valnew value In the case of the foreach binding, whenever the observable array changes, and the table rows      are rerendered, this code does get ran when reapplying the bindings, however the change handler doesnt get called when values are changed.     ko.applyBindingsToNodeelement,  value interceptor, event  change function   interceptorelement.val          view model creation  auto create ko view model from json sent from server function     viewModel  ko.mapping.fromJSjsonModel   ko.applyBindingsviewModel    old validation code document.onfocusout, .validaterange, function     var element  this,       val  element.val,       min  element.attrdatavalrangemin,       max  element.attrdatavalrangemax    if val lt min      my change handler from custom binding doesnt fire after this to update view model     element.valmin    if val gt max      my change handler from custom binding doesnt fire after this to update view model     element.valmax     more code to show error message  codepre  pHTML code that uses the custom binding inside of a foreach bindingp  precodelttablegt   lttheadgt     lttrgt       lttdgtPayment Amountlttdgt     lttrgt   lttheadgt   lttbody databindforeach Paymentsgt     lttrgt       lttdgtltinput typetext classvalidaterange datavalrangemin0 datavalrangemax9999999 databindamountValue Amount gtlttdgt     lttrgt   lttbodygt lttablegt codepre  pSo in the above example, if I enter 155 in an amount text box, my custom binding runs and sets the view model Amount to 155. Then the old validation runs and resets the value of the textbox to 0 with input.val0. My view model doesnt get updated at this point, and still reflects the 155 value. My change event handler from the custom binding is supposed to be ran to update the view model to 0, but it doesnt.p  pEditp  pAs pointed out in the answer, .val does not trigger any change events. The change event handler I added didnt do anything. The reason the view model was being updated when the validation code changed a value outside of the foreach binding was because we had logic somewhere else in our javascript code that was manually triggering the change event using the blur event, which in turn triggered my custom binding to run and update the view model. This blur event handler was directly bound to the text boxes, instead of being delegated, so it worked for text boxes that were there when the page is first rendered, but not for the ones dynamically inserted by the foreach binding.p  pFor now, I just changed this logic to delegate the events within the document, so it would include dynamically inserted text boxes, and it seems to be working fine. Im hoping to come up with a better solution in the future.p

Negative 69665 pMy questions are two fold  p  pWe have a asp .net Webforms website that lets users authenticate with sites like Facebook, Google, etc. and once authenticated, users are redirected back to our site and does some processing on some data that might take a few minutes to complete. The long running tasks are started on separate threads and users are shown the progress via Ajax calls. p  pSo far it was using InProc session on a single server and everything worked fine. Now we are moving to a web farm and have to move the session to an out of process model and thats my first question. What is the recommended way for storing session out of proc Or should I not use session at all and use something like memcached to store user generated data that is only valid for that user session What offers more scalability and performancep  pIn a web farm environment, as the subsequent requests could be served by any one of the servers, how do you handle long running tasks For e.g. the task could be started by one server and the next request from the same clientsession could come to a different server in the farm. In the single server  InProc model we were using ManualResetEvent to wait or timeout and would respond back to the client when the process is done. Should we just look for some shared object to be set in cachesessionp  pThanks for any tipshelp.p

Negative 69665 pWe are using JBoss 5.1 to deploy our application. But now we want to encrypt few classes in our war. When we encrypt a .class file, then Jboss throws error.

Negative 69665 pIm having a hard time figuring out the right way to animate my UI. I know how I could do these two things, but all the solutions Ive come up with mean a lot of ugly code and there must be a better way.p  pWhat would be the correct or the most cleanest way to animate some value, thats bind to a property. I have Color property on my model, that defines the background color of an element. When that color changes, I would like it to be smooth instead of just sudden color change. Could this be done in xaml, so that model wouldnt have to be aware of thatp  pHow about crossfading Currently Ive achieved this by placing two controls on top of each other in grid. When I start the change, I  1. Set visibility of element1 to visible 2. Start animation, that changes opacity of element1 from 0 to 1 3. Start animation, that changes opacity of element2 from 1 to 0 4. When animations have finished, set visibility of element2 to collapsed so that it wont capture all mouse eventsp  pOh, and MVVMapplication is written with C and XAML, using WinRTapip

Negative 69665 pI have a WCF service that uses various config parameters that are located in a database, as well as a cache for better performance. Right now I have a Singleton that holds this information and is initialized on the first call to the Webservice in a lazy loading behavior. p  pThe cache was exenteded lately and so the initialization takes some time, of course resulting in a longer response time on the first service request.p  pSo what would be the most efficient way to do some kind of eager loading initialization of the service before the fist call occurs probably on application pool startp
Negative 69665 pI have a SQLite project in IOS for Ipad. the database contains one table with a lot of products. what I want to do is separate this products into categories. so that i can make a separate tableview for each category. So my question is, can I use one table view with different sections, but put this sections side by side horizontally The application only work on landscape mode. I hope the question is clearly enough. Thanks.p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comVbyW1.jpg altenter image description herep

Negative 69665 pSo I dont program regularly and its been a while since I did anything. In any case Ive been asked to explore this calculator web app and see if I can execute it. So far Ive been exploring the jquery side of things with set values so Ive been good. However, its time to get a little bit more complicated and my experience with mysql and php is not great so I thought Id ask if this is feasible before I delve full on into this.p  pBasically what I want to do is a calculator that can be a roughly divided in to two parts base value and addon modifiers.p  pBase value is formed by two components, a fixed value and a modifier. These would be in drop down menus and positioned fixed so the user can always change the base value. As an example drop down A might give a fixed value of 1,000,000 and drop down B might modify this by 1.4 resulting in base value of 1,400,000.p  pOn top of the base value there are 3 ranges of addons with 9 different categories. So basically 9 times a radio switch with 3 options. Some of these might be modifiers such as add 2, 6 or 10 to base value, some might be set values.p  pMy question is is it feasible to do this as an interactive app As in would I need a form to be submitted each time to get to the final sum I mean the algorithm isnt overly complicated but the number of different factors makes it a bit intimidating to me.p  pCan I submit each value to a table in mysql and retrieve new values interactively The table is important to me as I want the user to be able to save the values so you can send a link to someone else and they can see what youve done.p  pI mean there are certain complexities such as if you change the set value of your base value which would result in first modifying this by the other factor and then adding on the number of complicated factors brought by the addons. You would effectively have to retrieve each value and run the whole algorithm each time something changed, correctp  pIf communicating with a table interactively is not feasible maybe I could execute the whole algorithm through javascript and have a separate save button which would then send each value to the table and give you a linkp  pI hope this made sense. Just to be clear Im just asking for some guidance not for anyone to give me ready code. If this sounds like a feasible goal to reach Ill crack on it. You can then no doubt find me here in the near future with some more detailed questions hahap

I would appreciate anyone who could help me figure out why the nil elements are still present. The code posted there is working code, for me, if you have the Sharpen namespace from the ngit project for Sharpen.AList, which is just a wrapper for Collections.List. Ive been doing a lot of javac lately.p  pThe reason Im interested in this is because I have a large large huge amount of data which is basically some java classes serialized with Jaxb 2.2.7, which I send over TCP to a C client which has analogous classes of the in java. The goal is to unmarshal that data right into the c classes. Unfortunately, I could not find a method in jaxb of naturally creating a universal reference tracker per object serialized, and had to manually write an XmlAdapter for each class I wanted tracked and referred to. It seems that DataContract does this naturally and quite easily. However, the JAXB doesnt put references to null elements in the output xml, and Id like to make sure that the DataContract stuff mimics the same behavior. p  pThank you.p

Negative 69665 pFirst of all, i really sorry, because i saw some related topics to this subject, but i could not understand...p  pI need help to learn how to move a sprite over a map when iam using a camera 2d.p  pThe map has 1800x968. When i move the sprite without the camera, everything works fine.p  pLet me explain it. I keep a vector2d with the current position of the sprite that i want to move.p  pWhen i click in any area of the map, i get the coordinate of the click and move the sprite until there. So, i refresh the current position of the sprite.p  pI keep the current position because i think i have to use it to decide if, for example, i have to move righ or left side. For example if my current position in xaxis is  than click area in xaxis, i have to move left. I dont know if this strategy is correct, but...p  pOk. My screen has 800x480, and, how i said, my map has 1800x968 bigger than my screen area.p  pIf i click the position 750 xaxis, right side of the screen, the sprite moves correctly until there. The camera moves too. Everything is ok, but the problem comes nowp  pThe current position of the sprite, in xaxis, is 750 now. But, because my camera moves, my sprite is now at the center of the screen its not at 750 xaxis anymore, because the camera moved. This is my problem. I have now to thing in an way to click again, for example, in the position 700 this time, and make the sprite moves to the right, but its current position is 750   700. How can i solve this Maybe, when the camera changes, i have to refresh the sprite currente position, but i dont know how...p  pThe same problem occurs in yaxis.p  pCan anyone help mep  pBelow, is my camera2d code, a sample that i copy from a topic Thanks in advancedp  precodepublic sealed class Camera2D      private const float zoomUpperLimit  1.5f     private const float zoomLowerLimit  .5f      private float zoom     private Matrix transform     private Vector2 pos     private float rotation     private int viewportWidth     private int viewportHeight     private int worldWidth     private int worldHeight      public Camera2DViewport viewport, int worldWidth,        int worldHeight, float initialZoom              zoom  initialZoom         rotation  0.0f         pos  Vector2.Zero         viewportWidth  viewport.Width         viewportHeight  viewport.Height         worldWidth  worldWidth         worldHeight  worldHeight           public float Zoom              get  return zoom          set                      zoom  value             if zoom lt zoomLowerLimit                 zoom  zoomLowerLimit             if zoom gt zoomUpperLimit                 zoom  zoomUpperLimit                    public float Rotation              get  return rotation          set  rotation  value            public void MoveVector2 amount              pos  amount           public Vector2 Pos              get  return pos          set                      float leftBarrier  floatviewportWidth  .5f  zoom             float rightBarrier  worldWidth  floatviewportWidth  .5f  zoom             float topBarrier  worldHeight  floatviewportHeight  .5f  zoom             float bottomBarrier  floatviewportHeight  .5f  zoom             pos  value             if pos.X lt leftBarrier                 pos.X  leftBarrier             if pos.X gt rightBarrier                 pos.X  rightBarrier             if pos.Y gt topBarrier                 pos.Y  topBarrier             if pos.Y lt bottomBarrier                 pos.Y  bottomBarrier                    public Matrix GetTransformation              transform             Matrix.CreateTranslationnew Vector3pos.X, pos.Y, 0             Matrix.CreateRotationZRotation             Matrix.CreateScalenew Vector3Zoom, Zoom, 1             Matrix.CreateTranslationnew Vector3viewportWidth  0.5f,                viewportHeight  0.5f, 0          return transform       codepre

Negative 69665 pA problem I often run into is needing to store a collection of objects in such a way that I can retrieve them by a particular fieldproperty that is a unique index for that object. For example, I have a codePersoncode object for which the codenamecode field is a unique identifier, and I want to be able to retrieve from some collection of codePersoncode objects the codePersoncode whose codenameSax Russellcode. In Java I usually accomplish this by using a codeMapcode where I actually want a codeSetcode, and always using the index field of the object as its key in the map, i.e. codepeopleMap.addmyPerson.getName, myPersoncode. I was thinking of doing the same thing in C with codeDictionarycodes, like thisp  precodeclass Person      public string Name get set     public int Age get set     ...   Dictionaryltstring, Persongt PersonProducerMethod      Dictionaryltstring, Persongt people  new Dictionaryltstring, Persongt     somehow produce Person instances...     people.addmyPerson.Name, myPerson     ...     return people   void PersonConsumerMethodDictionaryltstring, Persongt people, Listltstringgt names      foreachvar name  names          person  people[name]         process person somehow...       codepre  pHowever, this seems clumsy, and introduces a rather loose coupling between the keys of the codeDictionarycode and its values I implicitly depend on every producer of codePersoncode dictionaries using the codeNamecode property as the key under which to store each codePersoncode. I have no guarantee that the element at codepeople[Sax Russell]code is actually a codePersoncode with codeNameSax Russellcode unless I doublecheck every time I access the dictionary.p  pMight there be some way to explicitly ensure that my collection of codePersoncode objects is indexed by name, using custom equality comparers andor LINQ queries Its important that lookup stay constanttime, which is why I cant just use codeList.Findcode or codeEnumerable.Wherecode.

Negative 69665 pIm new to Django, so I may be completely off track here...p  pIve seen a lot of questions about being able to access the current user when an object is saved, but my problem is slightly different  Id like to use a special subclass of admin to show a user sets of objects, but only those object he or she has access to.p  pAt the moment I am attempting to do this by creating a special OpAdmin app, whose sole purpose is to have this specialized admin.  An OpAdmin model looks something like thisp  precodeclass OperatorAircraftManagermodels.Manager       def getquerysetself, user         return mainapp.models.Aircraft.objects.filterowneruser.employer  class Aircraftmainapp.models.Aircraft     class Meta         proxy  True     objects  OperatorAircraftManager codepre  pBut I am having a hard time getting my head around how I would pass the user information to codegetquerysetcode, or whether this is the wrong approach entirely should I be doing something with codeGroupscode or codePermissionscode instead   Again, this is not about saving the user info with a new Aircraft, or restricting who can change one, but about restricting who can emseeem them in admin.   Any suggestions would be appreciated  thanks.p  pEdit  I should add that I have also seen a number of get current user packages for use with Django, but they all seem a bit hacky looking on the current call stack for example, so Ive been reluctant to go that route.  If there is an accepted way to cache some shared information about the request context, that would be good to know...p

Negative 69665 pUsing the new .Net 4.5 AsyncAwait functionality with a CancellationToken, I get a codeSQLExceptioncode when I cancel a codeExecuteNonQueryAsynccode call, instead of a codeOperationCanceledExceptioncode or some other exception that is specific to canceling an operation.  The codeSQLExceptioncode does say codeOperation cancelled by usercode at the end of the message.  I expected a more specific exception to be thrown when canceling the operation.  Additionally, how would I create the appropriate TryCatch handlers to deal with this expected scenario  I normally would have the codeSQLExceptioncode as more general failure block, but now I would have to tease out the text of the message to see if this just the user clicking the Cancel button  I must be missing something.p  pHeres a simple VB WinForm app that has two buttons, one to do the Async call, and the other to cancel.  The TryCatch in the 1st button shows the codeSQLExceptioncode that is hit when the 2nd button calls the Cancel method.p  precodeDim cts As CancellationTokenSource Private Async Sub btnLocalTestClicksender As Object, e As EventArgs Handles btnLocalTest.Click     cts  New CancellationTokenSource     Dim CancelToken As CancellationToken  cts.Token     Using sconn As New SqlConnectionserverlocaldatabaseMyDBuser idMyUserpasswordMyPassword         sconn.Open         Dim SQL As String  some long running SELECT or INSERT statement         Try             Using scmd As New SqlCommandSQL, sconn                 scmd.CommandTimeout  300                 Dim i As Integer  Await scmd.ExecuteNonQueryAsyncCancelToken             End Using         Catch exCancel As OperationCanceledException             LogEventQuery canceled Exception.

When you cancel that task, you can the codeOperationCanceledExceptioncode exception that I originally expected above.  emSo the question remains what exception should you get when you cancel an Async task  Or is that dependent upon each method and its implementationemp

Negative 69665 pEdit Here is a video example to show what I want to be able to do with my ListView a hrefhttpwww.youtube.comwatchvcWXSEjABSrIampfeatureyoutu.be relnofollowListBox Scrolling Video Linkap  pIf you are familiar with ListBox control you have many pages of items in a Listbox you can click and hold your mouse down, drag your cursor updown and you can scroll through the items in the ListBox... also allowing you to scroll to the next page of items without using the scrollbar.p  pstrongCan this be accomplished via the ListViewstrongp  pHere is the scenario When the index of item changes in ListView it triggers a PictureBox to load an image based on that ListBox item.  So as you can imagine it is convenient to just hold down the mouse button and scroll to quickly scan through the ListBox itemspictures without having to use a keyboard.p  pThe problem with the ListView now is that you have to click on an item one at a time.

Negative 69665 pi have a project to display the sliding images, videos, flash, html page, audio etc on a web page by schedule by schedule. each schedule has few design, every design is nothing but one of these componentsvideoaudioimageflashhtml. am having outer for loop for schedule and inner forloop for designs under the schedules. inner for loop has few conditions to check the type of media and display the corresponding data using html div element on a jsp page. am getting the right path of each designs by using backend java code. what i want now is to clear the div elements for next next schedules. i have tried using subDiv.remove, it fails to show the videos and displaying the others. seeks your good suggestion to fix this. need to clear the schedules accordingly while new schedule comes in.p  precodelthtmlgt     ltheadgt         ltmeta httpequivContentType consatenttexthtml charsetUTF8gt         lttitlegtJSP Pagelttitlegt          lt        ltscriptgtgt         ltscript

Negative 69665 pI need a fast way to get the position of all one bits in a 64bit integer.  For example, given codex  123703code, Id like to fill an array codeidx[]  0, 1, 2, 4, 5, 8, 9, 13, 14, 15, 16code. We can assume we know the number of bits a priori.  This will be called 1012  1015 times, so speed is of the essence.  The fastest answer Ive come up with so far is the following monstrosity, which uses each byte of the 64bit integer as an index into tables that give the number of bits set in that byte and the positions of the onesp  precodeint64t x             this is the input unsigned char idx[K]  this is the array of K bits that are set unsigned char dstidx, src unsigned char zero, one, two, three, four, five   these hold the 0th5th bytes zero    x amp 0x0000000000FFUL one    x amp 0x00000000FF00UL gtgt 8 two    x amp 0x000000FF0000UL gtgt 16 three  x amp 0x0000FF000000UL gtgt 24 four   x amp 0x00FF00000000UL gtgt 32 five   x amp 0xFF0000000000UL gtgt 40 srctab0tabofs[zero ] COPYdst, src, n[zero ] srctab1tabofs[one  ] COPYdst, src, n[one  ] srctab2tabofs[two  ] COPYdst, src, n[two  ] srctab3tabofs[three] COPYdst, src, n[three] srctab4tabofs[four ] COPYdst, src, n[four ] srctab5tabofs[five ] COPYdst, src, n[five ] codepre  pwhere codeCOPYcode is a switch statement to copy up to 8 bytes, codencode is array of the number of bits set in a byte and codetabofscode gives the offset into codetabXcode, which holds the positions of the set bits in the Xth byte.  delThis is about 3x faster than unrolled loopbased methods with codebuiltinctzcode on my Xeon E52609.del See below.  I am currently iterating codexcode in lexicographical order for a given number of bits set.p  pIs there a better way  p  pstrongEDITstrong Added an example that I have subsequently fixed.  Full code is available here a hrefhttppastebin.com79X8XL2Phttppastebin.com79X8XL2Pa .  Note GCC with O2 seems to optimize it away, but Intels compiler which I used to compose it doesnt... p  pAlso, let me give some additional background to address some of the comments below.  The  goal is to perform a statistical test on every possible subset of K variables out of a universe of N possible explanatory variables the specific target right now is N41, but I can see some projects needing N up to 4550.  The test basically involves factorizing the corresponding data submatrix.  In pseudocode, something like thisp  precodedouble doTestdouble data, int64t model    int nidx, idx[]   double submatrix[][]   nidx  getIndicesmodel, idx   get the locations of ones in model    copy data into submatrix   forint i0 iltnidx i      forint j0 jltnidx j        submatrix[i][j]  data[idx[i]][idx[j]]           factorizesubmatrix, nidx   return theanswer  codepre  pI coded up a version of this for an Intel Phi board that should complete the N41 case in about 15 days, of which 510 of the time is spent in a naive codegetIndicescode so right off the bat a faster version could save a day or more.  Im working on an implementation for NVidia Kepler too, but unfortunately the problem I have ludicrous numbers of small matrix operations is not ideally suited to the hardware ludicrously large matrix operations.  That said, a hrefhttpieeexplore.ieee.orgxplarticleDetails.jsparnumber6267819this papera presents a solution that seems to achieve hundreds of GFLOPSs on matrices of my size by aggressively unrolling loops and performing the entire factorization in registers, with the caveat that the dimensions of the matrix be defined at compiletime.  This loop unrolling should help reduce overhead and improve vectorization in the Phi version too, so codegetIndicescode will become more important  So now Im thinking my kernel should look more likep  precodedouble data   move data to GPUPhi once into shared memory templateltunsigned int Kgt double doTestUnrolledint idx    double submatrix[K][K]    copy data into submatrix   pragma unroll   forint i0 iltK i      pragma unroll     forint j0 jltK j        submatrix[i][j]  data[idx[i]][idx[j]]           factorizeUnrolledltKgtsubmatrix   return theanswer  codepre  pThe Phi version solves each model in a cilkfor loop from model0 to 2N or, rather, a subset for testing, but now in order to batch work for the GPU and amortize the kernel launch overhead I have to iterate model numbers in lexicographical order for each of K1 to 41 bits set as doynax noted.  p  pstrongEDIT 2strong  Now that vacation is over, here are some results on my Xeon E52602 using icc version 15.  The code that I used to benchmark is here a hrefhttppastebin.comXvrGQUathttppastebin.comXvrGQUata.  I perform the bit extraction on integers that have exactly K bits set, so there is some overhead for the lexicographic iteration measured in the Base column in the table below.

Negative 69665 pIm developing a Django app and I came across with a weird issue concerning 2 souths migrations made in parallel.p  pOne migration corresponds to the creation of a new model lets call it 0001addmodel, and the second one corresponds to the addition of a field to an existing model lets call it 0001addnewfieldtomodel. Now, this 2 migrations were made in parallel in 2 different branches an error I wont make again. When I ran code.manage.py migratecode, south told me that there was a problem, and that I could run the command with codemergecode to run the migrations anyway. Given the fact that the 2 actions concern different models, I though there shouldnt be a problem to do so, so I did it and everything went right.p  pThe problem emerged when I did a code.manage.py schemamigration autocode from that point it generated me a migration practically identical to addmodel except for the field added in addfieldtomodel. It looks like thisp  precode   0001autoaddmodel     0001autoaddnewfieldtomodel  gt   0002autoaddmodel codepre  pIf I do it the other way around then it generates the reverse, ie, a migration to add the field that was added in addfieldtomodel. In both cases, the new migration generated is clearly inapplicable because those changes already exist in the database.p  pWhat puzzles me is why it generates such migration. How does souths autodetector works in order to create new migrationsp  pWhat I did in order to continue developing is to run this spurious migration with codefakecode, but I think the ultimate solution will be to reset migration history since that point, which is cumbersome, as it is replicated in several environments.p

Negative 69665 pSo, an Android String is internally stored as UTF16. What I do not know is if it is Big Endian or Little Endian that is used internally.p  pIf I call getBytesUTF, I get back a BE byte array with a BOM. Does this mean that this is the way the strings are stored internally as wellp  pI have a C API that I need to call with a byte buffer of UTF16 characters. I can adapt the C API to manage endianess if needed. p  pWhat I want to avoid is to do array copying in the Java level if not needed just to manage endianess. For that to work I need to know if the String internally is stored in Big or Little endian. If the String internally is stored in Little Endian, I prefer just to call getBytesUTF16LE and pass it straight away as Little Endian to the native code.p  pSo anyone know what Android uses under the hood and what call to getBytes... that is the most efficientp

Negative 69665 pI have a codeUICollectionViewControllercode setup. It shows something kind of like a gantt chart, with selectable bars, scrolling, etc. I want to have a trashdelete button that always floats in the bottom right of the screen, regardless of scroll. It will delete the current selection if theres one in the codeUICollectionViewcode.p  pI see two basic approachesp  ol lipUse the emSupplementary Viewsem facility of my codeUICollectionViewcode. What I dread about this, is that Ill have to muck with its layout in my layout Im using my own subclass of codeUICollectionViewLayoutcode to keep it positioned in the bottom right corner, regardless of scroll.pli lipJust add a UIButton to the canvas and set it up there. Maybe this isnt even a real approach, because this is what I wanted to do. While my button may manipulate items found in the codeUICollectionViewcode, its not really a real member of the collection view. But I found when I tried to drag a UIButton onto my Controller in the storyboard, it wouldnt emstickem. It doesnt seem to want to add it. Do I have to change to use a codeUISingleViewControllercode, and then have a top level view that I can add both my button and collection view into And then repeat all of the handy delegateproperty setup that I get for free from codeUICollectionViewControllercodepli ol

When that machine wimped out 4 years ago, I started searching for its replacement from Windows Vista7, iPad 123 gen, Android ... nothing supported the combination of handwriting, ease of stylus use, speed and ability to easily share the created documents until now. Windows 8 really shines in Surface Pro as does Office 2013. Both the OS and the application take advantage of the processing power and additional memory over the Surface RT. Taking notes in OneNote is a breeze  no lag or choppiness in capturing what I write and its great having a full Outlook client available again. Ill be interested to see how weight plays over time  but compared to my 2002 hybrid or the brick of an elite 2012 laptop my company gives me, this thing is light. I also gave it 4 for ease of use for Windows 8  while I have been using Windows 8 for over a year and it is definitely a much better experience on a touch device, it still lacks ease when compared to iOSAndroid tablets. As for native Windows apps compared to iOS  there are only 2 apps I regularly use on iOS that are not on Windows 8 History Channel Civil War and Hay Day if it werent for those, my iPad 3 would be retired to the kids.p  pThis is a great product.

Negative 69665 pI have been attempting to find a way to read data correctly from a channel using the xivelypython library. I tried retrieving currentvalue but it only seems to retrieve the initial value, even after changing the value in the channel in the Xively interface. For instance, the initial value in channel command is Exit. This is correctly retrieved and executed by my program. However, if I end the program, update the command channel value to AA and then restart my program, it still picks up Exit. I have tested this over 1015 minutes and ensured more than 20 seconds to ensure it updates correctly.p  pLooking at the API I cant seem to work out a way to do it. What I wish to do is retrieve the latest value for a given channel. Im using the channel as a method to pass commands between unconnected devices. I would be looking to read the channel regularly.p  pA small note, I saw a similar issue that was posted a year ago but has not be answered.p  pEDIT I only appear to read the currentvalue once at the beginning of the program based on the Xively HTTP requests feed, the code I am using is thisp  precodeusrbinenv python   coding utf8   import serial library and sleep from the time library import serial from time import sleep import xively import requests from datetime import datetime  declare port and baud rate then open conn port  devttyAMA0 baud  9600 ser  serial.Serialportport, baudrate  baud  xively variables FEEDID  1032676103 APIKEY  FZ2IOZkDW5ZXAITh6kqqUVkZEIBfNk6y2SKxgx4DDDVLxi46  xively connection function reutrning a datastream handle def openconnectionfeed,target     try         datastream  feed.datastreams.gettarget         printChannel   target   found         return datastream     except         datastream  feed.datastreams.createtarget         printChannel   target   not found,new channel created         return datastream  push function def pushtarget,value     target.currentvalue  value     target.at  datetime.utcnow     try         target.update     except requests.HTTPError as e         print HTTPError0 1.formate.errno,e.strerror  pop function def pull     command  openconnectionfeed,Command     command.at  datetime.utcnow     sleep0.2     return target.getdatetime.utcnow     return command.currentvalue   check status of board 1 relay A def statusone     ser.writeaAARELAYA     sleep0.2     reply  ser.read12     sleep0.2     relayAA  reply[9]     relayAA  relayAA.strip     return relayAA     check status of board 2 relay A def statustwo     ser.writeaBBRELAYA     sleep0.2     reply  ser.read12     relayBA  reply[9]     relayBA  relayBA.strip     return relayBA  toggle boardAA relay A function def toggleaa     ser.writeaAARELAYATOG     sleep0.2     reply  ser.read12     printreply     sleep0.2  toggle boardBB relay A function def togglebb     ser.writeaBBRELAYATOG     sleep0.2     reply  ser.read12     printreply     sleep0.2      setup and initial push to Xively  ser.flushInput  api  xively.XivelyAPIClientAPIKEY feed  api.feeds.getFEEDID oneastatus  openconnectionfeed,Relay1A twoastatus  openconnectionfeed,Relay2A hubstatus  openconnectionfeed,RelayData command  openconnectionfeed,Command hub  1 pushhubstatus,hub  relayAA  statusone printrelayAA pushoneastatus,relayAA relayBA  statustwo printrelayBA pushtwoastatus,relayBA   loop section  command handling while hub      operator  pullcommand     operator  pull     sleep0.2     printoperator      command to toggle AA     if operator  AA         toggleaa         sleep0.2         relayAA  statusone         pushoneastatus,relayAA         sleep0.2      command to toggle BA     if operator  BA         togglebb         sleep0.2         relayBA  statustwo         pushtwoastatus,relayBA         sleep0.2      command to shutdown     if operator  Exit         hub  0   close conn pushhubstatus,hub  ser.close codepre  pAs you can see, I initially attempted to create the command variable connection once, then afterwards tried creating it inside the loop to see if it changed things.

Each of the A1, A2 and A3 entities have around 10  20 attributesrelationships.p  pNow p  ul liApp1 only uses A, A1, B, C, D,li liApp2 only uses A, A2, B, C, D,li liApp3 only uses A, A3, Bli ul  pI have read cant remember where that to model sub entities in sqlite, CoreData just creates a table for the parent entity that contains all attributes and relationship of sub entities as table columns. Therefore it would often not be advisable to create small parententities with several large subentities, since it would lead to a lot of empty columns for each of the subentities which dont need the columns for attributes of other subentities. p  pNow, using configurations, I could create three configurations Conf1, Conf2, Conf3 like thatp  ul liConf1 contains entities A, A1, B, C, D,li liConf2 contains entities A, A2, B, C, D,li liConf3 contains entities A, A3, Bli ul  pEach of the apps would use a single store with the appropriate configuration, so I wouldnt make use of the store the object automatically in the correct store advantage configurations have when used with several stores.p  pHowever, my hope is that by adding a store for the specific configurations in each of the apps, the store would ignore the attributes of the nonincluded entities and thus not create the appropriate table colums. In Case of App3Conf3 it would even avoid the creation of tables for entities C and D altogether.p  pMy questions is Does it work that way Would the superfluous columns be left out in persistent stores that use the correct configurationp  pAnd if so Does it actually make a difference in performance or storage requirements assuming a number of objects so performance optimizations actually start to make sensep

Negative 69665 pI have a code A that is statically linked against one version of mpich. Now comes library B, which is used by A via dlopen. B depends on mpich as well, but is linked dynamically against it. p  pThe problem is that now, in order for B to take advantage of mpi distribution, needs to access the communicator currently handled by A. This communicator has been created by A static version of mpich, When B invokes MPI routines, it will use a dynamic version of MPI which is not guarateed to be compatible with the static version attached to A.p  pThis is the overall picture. I think that the only solution is to have mpich dynamically linked for both A and B. What I am not fully understanding is however the followingp  ul lihow does the linker handle shared objects dependencies when dlopening Will I have two instances of mpich in VM also with dynamic linking, or is the linker smart enough to realize that the symbols required by the dlopened B are already in the address space and will resolve against those.li liIs it possible to tell the linker when you dlopen this library, dont go fetch the dynamic dependency, but resolve it with the static symbols that are already provided by Ali ul
Negative 69665 pI recently a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions23432954posteda about a bug in MonoMac in which the window would abruptly disappear after clicking on a button 20 times or so.  That bug, it turned out, doesnt seem to affect Xamarin.Mac, so I switched my project to that.p  pBut now Im seeing virtually the same bug in a different context after typing a few lines of text into an NSTextField, the window disappears in exactly the same manner.  No error, no exception it just vanishes.  Poof, gonep  pIve reproduced this in a trivial project you can see it yourself by creating a new empty Xamarin.Mac project, adding a hrefhttpwww.smipple.netsnippetJoeStroutXamarin.Mac20NSTextField20bug20demo relnofollowthis codea in a new file, and running.  Then mash the keyboard a little while.  After 5 or 6 lines, the window disappears.p  pNote that the app menus continue to work, writing log messages and executing my code when I select the menu commands.  So it doesnt appear as though the app itself has crashed.p  pCuriously, this seems to only occur when the field is inside an NSView subclass where IsFlipped has been overridden.  But it doesnt matter whether IsFlipped returns true or false  if the method is there at all, the bug occurs if commented out, the bug does not seem to occur.p  pSo Has anyone else run into this sort of bug in Xamarin.Mac  Perhaps in other contexts that will give us more clues as to a root cause  Any debugging tips for a Xamarin newbie  p  pI know I could work around it in some projects by avoiding IsFlipped, but I worry that it would just pop up to bite me in some other way.p

Negative 69665 pIm aware of and have used two methods in the past for basic tree structures adjacency lists and nested sets. I understand several pros and cons to these approaches  e.g., that adjacency lists are quick to update but slow to query, that nested sets are the opposite slow to update, quick to query.p  pHowever, I require the ability to store more complex treelike structures. The best way to describe this is using human family relationships. My first thought was that each element could have both a ancestors tree and a descendants tree. However, there will be significant redudancy in this approach as, using the example below, both Cameron and Kelly will share all of Bobs ancestor tree and updates will be even more time consuming, as an insertion to the tree will actually have to insert into multiple trees. My second thought was to include tree references. E.g., say that Alice has her own ancestor tree. Both the 4,5 element coming from Camerons ancestor tree, and the 2,3 element coming from Kellys ancestor tree would simply reference Alices ancestor tree. This second approach requires less data storage, would experience faster updates only an update to a single tree vs. multiple trees and would retain the speed advantages of querying a large tree structure although the SQL to query such a selfreferencing nested set is rather complicated. However, a drawback to the second approach is that the data becomes fragmented much like inodes on a hard drive.p  precode A  Alice                                    B  Bob                                      C  Cameron                                  J  John                                     K  Kelly                                                         2 Bob 3            4 Alice 5                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  1 Cameron 6                                                         2 Alice 3            4 John 5                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  1 Kelly 6                                                                                 1 Alice 6                                                                                                                                                                                      2 Cameron 3        4 Kelly 5               codepre  pFor the second approach, I am visualising multiple nested sets stacked in front of one another, with certain nodes drawing a line along the zindex to a node on another plane.p  pNote that the above is just an example  Im not actually storing human relationships, but I am storing complex tree like data.

So the issue is about battery consumption  which is a major issue if the interval is very small.p  pIf, however, you need to update more frequently andor you do not need to update while the device is asleep, then you can instead perform updates based on an alarm that will not wake the device. To do so, set an alarm with an Intent that your AppWidgetProvider receives, using the AlarmManager. Set the alarm type to either ELAPSEDREALTIME or RTC, which will only deliver the alarm when the device is awake. Then set updatePeriodMillis to zero 0. to  The code would look something like thisp  precodefinal Intent intent  new Intentcontext, UpdateService.class final PendingIntent pending  PendingIntent.getServicecontext, 0, intent, 0 final AlarmManager alarm  AlarmManager context.getSystemServiceContext.ALARMSERVICE alarm.cancelpending long interval  100060 alarm.setRepeatingAlarmManager.ELAPSEDREALTIME, SystemClock.elapsedRealtime,interval, pending codepre  pSo my question is as follows Lets say the AlarmManager is used to carry out the update. Additionally, if in the widgetproviderinfo.xml, updatePeriodMillis is strongNOTstrong set to 0, then  Which value will take the precedence The value specified as part of the Alarm or updatePeriodMillisp

Negative 69665 pIm writing a profiler library whose task it is to print the names of the functions in an application as and when they are executed. To achieve this, I have compiled app with the Gh flag and linked it to the profiler which has the definition of penter. penter calls a function that retrieves the name and prints it. This is happening correctly.p  pTo remove instances where the same function is being printed twice, Im using an unorderedset in the profiler.p  pThis too works very well except when the app includes the unorderedset class and uses its methods.p  pWhen the app does this, the profilers calls to unorderedset methods invoke penter as well, thus putting the code into an infinite recursive loop, and causing a stackoverflow.

Negative 69665 pem No, it doesnt entirely.  My question covers ADDING patterns and type signatures interactively...which is apparently impossible.emp  pThe most basic things you might try do from early tutorials wont work in GHCip  precodefoo []  [] foo xxs  x  foo xs codepre  pThat works if you put it into codefoo.hscode and at the GHCi prompt type codeload foo.hscode.  You can then invoke foo on a list and get the list back.p  pEarly Google searches tell you that in GHCi you need a codeletcode statement.  But in this case a function defined with multiple patterns it wont workp  precodePreludegt let foo []  [] Preludegt let foo xxs  x  foo xs Preludegt foo [1, 2, 3] [1,2,3 Exception ltinteractivegt3527 Nonexhaustive patterns      in function foo codepre  pThe second let overwrote the first let.  Leaving out the let isnt an option.  And it doesnt like it if you type in expressions like codefoo  [a] gt [a]code either.p  pThe tutorials seem to sidestep this and send you quickly into putting your code into files.

Negative 69665 pI am having trouble with abstract classes at the moment. p  pI am told I need to  emMake an abstract class called Sprite, which stores an x,y position, and a reference to an Image. The constructor of your Sprite class should take 2 int parameters to specify the initial x and y position, and a string which is the name of the file to load the image from, and it should load the image instead of the Turtle class loading the image. It will need a getter function for the image. Make an abstract method in your Sprite class named public void updateGraphics g. This function should have no body. The purpose of this is to ensure that any class which inherits from this class implements an update function.em p  pI think I understand how to make an abstract class, as I have done. I also think I did okay on the parameters in the constructor of the Sprite class. However, Ive never loaded images in Java and Im not sure how to extendimplement the abstract class functions.

Negative 69665 pAccording to the a hrefhttpsdocs.angularjs.orgapingdirectiveselect relnofollowAngular documentationa, you can create a null option that is not part of your model. This allows you to have a descriptive option. I.E. in their example they have code choose color code.

Negative 69665 pI am making a simple Enterprise application using JSF as my presentation layer.  First I designed my EntityBean from the Java Database sample table codeCUSTOMERcode and then created codeCustomerSessionBeancode with an EntityManager to access the DB. I then added the framework JSF to the war project if I compile and run everything works fine. But now I right click on my war project and added a codeJSFManagedBeancode. At this point if I run its ok, but if I add field such as Customer from my Entity or codeCustomerSessionBeancode it will not deploy. then I removed the annotation codeManagedBeancode and its deployed. I suspect I am missing something.

Negative 69665 pTrying to style my UILabel, in Attributes Inspector I set the font of my attributed text to codeApple Chancerycode. In the preview window it shows correctly, but in the UIView itself the font is not applying. And when I try running the device just in case, the font still does not show.

Negative 69665 pRecently I have learned about multithreading library in c11.

Negative 69665 pIm trying to better understand Haskells laziness, such as when it evaluates an argument to a function.p  pFrom this a hrefhttpalpmestan.composts20131002ohmylaziness.html relnofollowsourceap  blockquote   pBut when a call to codeconstcode is evaluated thats the situation we are interested in, here, after all, its return value is evaluated too ... This is a good general principle a function obviously is strict in its return value, because when a function application needs to be evaluated, it needs to evaluate, in the body of the function, what gets returned. Starting from there, you can know what must be evaluated by looking at what the return value depends on invariably. Your function will be strict in these arguments, and lazy in the others.p blockquote  pSo a function in Haskell always evaluates its own return value If I havep  precodefoo  Num a gt [a] gt [a] foo []  [] foo xs  map  2 xs  head foo [1..]   4 codepre  pAccording to the above paragraph, codemap  2 xscode, must be evaluated. Intuitively, I would think that means applying the codemapcode to the entire list resulting in an infinite loop. But, I can successfully take the head of the result. I know that codecode is lazy in Haskell, so does this mean that evaluating codemap  2 xscode just means constructing something else that isnt fully evaluated yet p  pWhat does it mean to evaluate a function applied to an infinite list If the return value of a function is always evaluated when the function is evaluated, can a function ever actually return a thunkp  pEditp  precodebar x y  x var  bar product [1..] 1 codepre  pThis code doesnt hang. When I create codevarcode, does it not evaluate its body Or does it set codebarcode to codeproduct [1..]code and not evaluate that If the latter, codebarcode is not returning its body in WHNF, right, so did it really evaluate x How could codebarcode be strict in codexcode if it doesnt hang on computing codeproduct [1..]codep

Negative 69665 pIm developingmaintainingcurating a database of test results gathered from various wearable research devices. Each device has three main components, each of which has two version numbers firmware and hardware. Im using a django app to provide a web interface to the database. The version numbers represented either as straight integers, or as triplets Major, minor, build. The integers are easy enough to handle, and I can obviously store the triplets as strings, but as strings they wont sort correctly or compare correctly, for example if I want only test results produced by devices with firmware version less than 14.x.y.p  pI cant use a float because of the second decimal point separator. I thought of maybe going for a hack by storing it as a date, but that will limit minor numbers to less than 12 and build numbers to less than 29, and besides I strongknowstrong this is a terrible solution. I probably shouldnt even confess to having thought of it.p  pShort of extending the database with some PLSQL to provide a comparison function that treats the strings correctly, is there a simple way to do this If not, can I even use my custom SQL function with djangop
Negative 69665 pfor a research application, we need to crawl some tweets for a specific user that have been posted after a certain event. p  pIn detail, we have a message that mentions a user and we would like to fetch some not all tweets from that user that have been posted directly afterwards. I tried to achieve this using the REST API, but it seems that we have following problemp  pAs a hrefhttpsdev.twitter.comrestreferencegetstatusesusertimeline relnofollowhttpsdev.twitter.comrestreferencegetstatusesusertimelinea asd a hrefhttpsdev.twitter.comrestpublictimelines relnofollowhttpsdev.twitter.comrestpublictimelinesa denote, the api will always return the most recent tweets for a specific request. The only information that we have is the ID of the mentiontweet, so our results have to be younger. But the twitter API allows to set a codesinceidcode, but will still begin with the most recent messages. We need it the other way aroundp  precode Mention           ID 100  Interesting post  ID 103  Interesting post  ID 105  Boring post       ID 108  ...               ...      Boring post       ID 500   codepre  pWhen we use the usertimeline rest call, twitter will return boring posts with ID 500300 max is 200 messages, no matter if we set sinceid to 100 or not. What we would like are posts with ID 100  300. p  pI am aware that for some users, these posts are unavailable, as twitter only allows access to the most recent 3200 posts. p  pOur current approach is to fetch the most recent 200 posts, then find the oldest one returned, and then fetch another batch with codemaxidcode set accordingly. This way, we could handle our way down to the mention, but it takes a very long time too long and wastes our api requests, as most of the data is not required.p

Negative 69665 pI am creating a webGL game, using Three.js library. I am creating movement in the space with keyboard arrows. I want to enable user to simultaneously rotating and moving by pressing the leftright arrow together with the updown arrow. For this reason, I have created a map holding the status of all needed keys. The used code is the following p  precodevar keyMap  [] document.addEventListenerkeydown, onDocumentKeyDown, true  document.addEventListenerkeyup, onDocumentKeyUp, true function onDocumentKeyDownevent      var keyCode  event.keyCode     keyMap[keyCode]  true     executeMovement  function onDocumentKeyUpevent     var keyCode  event.keyCode     keyMap[keyCode]  false     executeMovement  function executeMovement     var cameraNeck  cameraEquipment.getNeck     ifkeyMap[37]  true         rotate left          ifkeyMap[39]  true         rotate right          ifkeyMap[38]  true         move front          ifkeyMap[40]  true         move back  codepre  pIt works, meaning that when a user holds down 2 keys in the same time, he moves and rotates simultaneously. However, it has the following problem. For example, let assume the user presses first the up arrow, and then without leaving it, he presses the left arrow. If he then leaves the button that was pressed first up arrow, everything works as expected and the user is left rotating left. However, if the user leaves the button pressed last left arrow, the user then stops moving and rotating both.p  pIt seems that in the sequence of key presses, the event of keyUp of the one button triggers keyUp for the other one, or something like that. I have tried many different ways of debugging and I have started considering the possibility that there is something wrong with the whole implementation. p

One on the longpress and then on the release, it ends, but calls it again thus creating two recordings. I have one button that has multiple protocols firing at the same time and Im curious if this is a problem. I took a look at this link p  pa hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions3319591uilongpressgesturerecognizergetscalledtwicewhenpressingdownUILongPressGestureRecognizer gets called twice when pressing downap  pbut Im not getting the results I want.p  pThe button also zooms when the longpressstate begins and it goes back to its regular size when the longpressstate ends so I have some animation code below

Negative 69665 pI am about to submit two new apps to the iOS App Store. One is a free version of the other. When certain actions are attempted in the free version, an alert will be displayed which will offer to take the user to the App Store to view the full version. I can use StoreKits SKStoreProductViewController to display the details of the full app, but the problem is that I need to know the iTunes item identifier so that the SKStoreProductViewController will be able to load the product. I cant figure out where to find this ID if it even exists before the app is live on the store. I could code the app to download a file from my web server containing the ID, and update the file with the ID number as soon as it goes live on the store. But I dont like the idea of the app being dependent on this file in order to find the correct ID. So, is it possible to find the iTunes item identifier for an unreleased appp

Negative 69665 pI started a new iOS project about 4 months ago in Swift just to learn the language. While Ive been developing it, I found myself almost never using tuples in the entire program. This is because Im really used to Java and ObjectiveC which do not have tuples.p  pIve heard some great things about tuples, and Apple seemed very excited about adding them into Swift, but it seems like Im having a hard time finding a really useful case for them.p  pI understand and use them for one thing so far quickclass replacer. Instead of making a new class for the sole purpose of keeping a few properties together, use a tuple instead. But even then Ive only used a tuple for that once, because many times those properties affect each other, so those methods that alter those properties are better contained in a class with those properties. So is this really an advantagep  pBut what are some other really useful design patterns used in OOP or Swift that people who are new to tuples should know aboutp  pThanksp

Negative 69665 pI am trying to create a working registration validation however I have a problem. The validations work but there is an error, even if the user enters the correct information the INSERT statement is not executed. However, when the elseif statement is removed then the error is echoed on the interface but the data is still INSERTED even if there is an error in the user form such as the password only having letters. I Would be grateful if anyone could fix this error. The complete validation is below.

But as it is aimed to grow with the time, I dont want to publish ALL the posts to each clients.p  pHow can I only publish and subscribe to posts owned by me or my friends, and in a limited number  I dont want to load more than the 15 last posts at a time. And when I click a a button, I load 15 more like when on FB, when you scroll at the bottom of the page, it automaticcaly append older posts.p  pThanks you for your help.p

Negative 69665 pIm trying to extract data from the PennTreeBank, Wall Street Journal corpus. Most of it already has the parse trees, but some of the data is only tagged. i.e. wsjDDXX.mrg and wsjDDXX.pos files.p  pI would like to use the already parsed trees and tagged data in these files so as not to use the parser and taggers within CoreNLP, but I still want the output file format that CoreNLP gives namely, the XML file that contains the dependencies, entity coreference, and the parse tree and tagged data.p  pIve read many of the java docs but I cannot figure out how to get it the way I described.p  pFor POS, I tried using the a hrefhttpnlp.stanford.edunlpjavadocjavanlp3.5.2edustanfordnlpparserlexparserLexicalizedParser.html relnofollowLexicalizedParsera and it allows me to use the tags, but I can only generate an XML file with the some of the information I want there is no option for coreference or generating the parse trees. To get it to correctly generate the suboptimal XML files here, I had to write a script to get rid of all of the brackets within the files. This is the command I usep  blockquote   pjava cp  edu.stanford.nlp.parser.lexparser.LexicalizedParser outputFormat typedDependenciesCollapsed,wordsAndTags outputFilesExtension xml outputFormatOptions xml writeOutputFiles outputFilesDirectory mydir tokenized tagSeparator  tokenizerFactory edu.stanford.nlp.process.WhitespaceTokenizer tokenizerMethod newCoreLabelTokenizerFactory edustanfordnlpmodelslexparserenglishPCFG.ser.gz mywsjfilesdirp blockquote  pI also cant generate the data I would like to have for the WSJ data that already has the trees. I tried using what is said a hrefhttpnlp.stanford.edusoftwareparserfaq.shtmls relnofollowherea and I looked at the corresponding Javadocs. I used the command similar to what is described. But I had to write a python program to retrieve the stdout data resulting from analyzing each file and wrote it into a new file. This resulting data is only a text file with the dependencies and is not in the desired XML notation.p  pTo summarize, I would like to use the POS and tree data from these PTB files in order to generate a CoreNLP parse corresponding to what would occur if I used CoreNLP on a regular text file. The pseudo command would be like thisp  blockquote   pjava cp  edu.stanford.nlp.pipeline.CoreNLP useTreeFile wsjDDXX.mrgp blockquote  pandp  blockquote   pjava cp  edu.stanford.nlp.pipeline.CoreNLP usePOSFile wsjDDXX.posp blockquote  pEdit fixed a link.p

Negative 69665 pIm trying to implement app in which you can add your own marker which will be given a shutdown time. To do so I need to know how to manage my markers. Lets say I have array list of users with assigned unique ID. p  precode    private ArrayListltUsergt userList  new ArrayListltgt codepre  pThen I will create array list of markers which will contain information like Latitude, Longitude, Title, owners ID and deadline. p  precode    private ArrayListltMyMarkergt mMarkersArray  new ArrayListltMyMarkergt codepre  pNext whenever user will activate add marker method, new marker will be pushed to my list of markers. Ideologically everything seems nice and easy, furthermore creating new object looks like thisp  precode    Marker mMarker  mMap.addMarkernew MarkerOptions ...  codepre  pbut when it comes to managing specific markers it seems like Im missing something. There will be some trigger method which will check the deadline of all markers or rather first one on the sorted by deadline list and then it should remove not hide, because I think it would be inefficient from the memory point of view. How to achieve this I cant add some custom variable like ID to markers so I could then find the one Im interested in and Im a bit lost.p  pThere is a way to achieve this by clearing whole map and then rendering again all markers except the inactive, but as far as Im concerned its very inefficient and there has to be better solution.p

Negative 69665 pWe have some applications that are reaching out to a lot of our own internal web services. This causes performance issues and many singlepointsoffailure for each app. We are brainstorming alternate strategies. p  pOne thought was to dynamically load the classes with the backend logic into the web apps, maybe with OSGI, but OSGI looks like it adds significant complexity.p  pAnother thought was to just use a URLClassLoader to load the classes out of jars in the database into our web apps. I created a prototype and its very simple code and seems to work beautifully. I looked around for examples, patterns, frameworks or anything that uses this technique and was not able to find any examples. This makes me think theres an issue with this technique that were not seeing.p  pAre there issues with loading backend classes to a web app in an application server in our case, WebLogic via URLClassLoader and delegating work to them Or emisem there precendence and I just havent found itp  pstrongUpdatestrongp  pThere were requests for the particulars of our current design...p  pThere are web services that expose both a servlet mapped to dataem and a javascript file served at uibuilder.js which holds the js to build a widget. The web app consumers have a generic servlet in them that proxies any jsmodulexdataem or jsmodulexuibuilder.js request back to web service x where x is the module name. The web apps include codeltscript srcjsmodulexuibuilder.jsgtltscriptgtcode in their HTML which is proxied back the the web service and the js file is returned to the browser. Then js in the web app calls codejsmodule.x.buildUIsomeDivcode which causes the js to build a widget that the user interacts with. That widget then calls to the web app for backend logic which are proxied back to the web service. This architecture allows us to share these modules w a ui piece and cooresponding backend between web apps.p  pWere considering ways to eliminate the singlepointsoffailure and performance hit from all these little web service calls. The js is easy. The proxy servlet in the web apps can just cache the js contents. The backend calls to the servlet are harder. Were considering importing the backend classes currently in the web service into the web app instead of making a web service call to invoke them which in turn invoke other web services, etc.p  pOptionsp  ul liBundle the Jars into the web apps requires rebuilddeploy of all consuming apps if lib changesli liDeploy a shared lib for each module into each apps server this would end up being a LOT of shared libsli liempotentially...em Using a URLClassLoader to load backend classes from the dbli liWeb service current designli ul  pClarifications...p  pThe performance concern is to eliminate the call back to the web service for each request not the time it takes to actually load the classes.p  pAny options we go with will include version control, testing, etc.p  pstrongUpdatestrongp  pAn example...p  pLets say theres a PersonManager web service exposing personManageraddPerson. Within the web service theres a PersonManager class with and addPersonPerson method which loads the data into a db. 5 web apps call the service every time a person needs to be added performance hit and if the service goes down, all 5 apps are affected singlepointoffailure.p  pThe idea which Im still not sold on is...p  pWhat if instead, the WS exposes a jar and the web app instead of calling the web service for each request loads the class once from the web service and delegates any addPerson requests to the class that is now loaded within the web app instead of calling the service. Now only the db has to be up. If the service goes down, no affect.p

Negative 69665 pPlease read this whole question before answering, as its not what you think...  Im looking at creating python object wrappers that represent hardware devices on a system trimmed example below.  p  precodeclass TPMobject      property     def attr1self                  Protects value from being accidentally modified after          constructor is called.                  return self.attr1      def initself, attr1, ...         self.attr1  attr1         ...      classmethod     def scancls         Calls Popen, parses to dict, and passes dict to constructor codepre  pMost of the constructor inputs involve running command line outputs in subprocess.Popen and then parsing the output to fill in object attributes.  Ive come up with a few ways to handle these, but Im unsatisfied with what Ive put together just far and am trying to find a better solution.  Here are the common catches that Ive found.  Quick note tool versions are tightly controlled, so parsed outputs dont change unexpectedly.p  ol lipMany tools produce variant outputs, sometimes including fields and sometimes not.  This means that if you assemble a dict to be wrapped in a container object, the constructor is more or less forced to take kwargs and not really have defined fields.  I dont like this because it makes static analysis via pylint, etc less than useful.  Id prefer a defined interface so that sphinx documentation is clearer and errors can be more reliably detected.pli lipIn lieu of kwargs, Ive also tried setting default args to None for many of the fields, with what ends up as pretty ugly results.  One thing I dislike strongly about this option is that optional fields dont always come at the end of the command line tool output.  This makes it a little mindbending to look at the constructor and match it up to tool output.pli lipId greatly prefer to avoid constructing a dictionary in the first place, but using setattr to create attributes will make pylint unable to detect the attr1, etc... and create warnings.  Any ideas here are welcome...pli ol  pBasically, I am looking for the proper Pythonic way to do this.  My requirements, for a resummary are the followingp  ol liCommand line tool output parsed into a container object.li liContainer object protects attributes via properties postconstruction.li liVarying number of inputs to constructor, with working static analysis and error detection for missing required fields during runtime.li ol  pIs there a good way of doing this hopefully without a ton of boilerplate code in Python  If so, what is itp  hr  pEDITp  pPer some of the clarification requests, we can take a look at the tpmversion command.  Heres the output for my laptop, but for this TPM it doesnt include every possible attribute.  Sometimes, the command will return extra attributes that I also want to capture.  This makes parsing to known attribute names on a container object fairly difficult.p  precodeTPM 1.2 Version Info Chip Version        1.2.4.40 Spec Level          2 Errata Revision     3 TPM Vendor ID       IFX Vendor Specific data 04280077 0074706d 3631ffff ff TPM Version         01010000 Manufacturer Info   49465800 codepre  pExample code ignore lack of sanity checks, please.  trimmed for brevityp  precodedef initself, chipversion, speclevel, erratarevision,              tpmvendorid, vendorspecificdata, tpmversion,              manufacturerinfo     self.chipversion  chipversion     ...  classmethod def scancls     tpmproc  Popenusrsbintpmversion     stdout, stderr  Popen.communicate      tpmdict  dict     for line in tpmproc.stdout.splitlines         if Version Info in line             pass         else             splitline  line.split             attributename                   splitline[0].strip.replace , .lower             tpmdict[attributename]  splitline[1].strip     return clstpmdict codepre  pThe problem here is that this or a different one that I may not be able to review the source of to get every possible field could add extra things that cause my parser to work, but my object to not capture the fields.

Negative 69665 pConsider a recursive function where the recursive call is the line of the function.

That is, the debugger makes it look as though return is done incrementally, in the same order as functions were called.p  ol start2 liCase 2li ol  pHowever, if I comment out that line, eclipse debugger makes it look as though it returns from the base case at n0 to n1 and then directly to main.p  pI understand that since in Case 2, there is nothing left to execute after returning from the call, it just goes frame up without displaying anything.p  pHowever, this makes for confusing debugging.

Negative 69665 pAfter testing our Yii2 website on different devices, Ive encountered a bad problem with the masked input on email and mobile numbers.p  pWhenever I try to enter values, the input position skips to a different position and incorrect characters keep showing up. For instancep  blockquote   pText Input helloemail.com   Text Output he  helho.p blockquote  pAdditionally, the backspace does not seem to work properly either.p  pAfter much research, I believe that this is a known issue between the masked input plugin and androids stock browser. Ive checked forums and this issue seems to persist still up to now. Since were using Yii2 frameworks masked input I cant just modify the core file.p  pAnyway, as a workaround, what I did was remove the masks whenever the website is accessed on an Android device by checking the userAgent for instance like sop  precodeifstrposuserAgent, Android  false           echo the masked text field  else           echo the text field without mask  codepre  pThis works but I think its quite a dirty and not ideal workaround.

Negative 69665 pIm trying to work out a new caching policy for the static resources on a website. A common problem is whenever javascript, CSS etc. is updated, many users hold onto stale versions because currently there are no caching specific HTTP headers included in the file responses.p  pThis becomes a serious problem when, for example, the javascript updates are linked to serverside updates, and the stale javascript chokes on the new server responses.p  pEliminating browser caching completely with a codecachecontrol maxage0, nocachecode seems like overkill, since Id still like to take some pressure off the server by letting browsers cache temporarily. So, setting the cache policy to a maximum of one hour seems alright, like codecachecontrol maxage3600, nocachecode.p  pMy understanding is that this will always fetch a new copy of the resource if the cached copy is older than one hour. Id specifically like to know if its possible to set a HTTP header or combination of headers that will instruct browsers to only fetch a new copy if the resource was stronglast checkedstrong more than one hour ago AND strongif the resource has changedstrong.p  pIm just trying to avoid browsers blindly fetching new copies just because the cached resource is older than one hour, so Id also like to add the condition that the resource has been changed.p  pJust to illustrate further what Im askingp  ol liNew user arrives at site and gets fresh copy of script.jsli liUser stays on site for 45 mins, browser uses cached copy of script.js all the timeli liUser comes back to site 2 hours later, and browser asks the server if script.js has changedli liIf it has, then it gets a fresh copy and the process repeatsli liIf it has not changed, then it uses the cached copy for the next hour, after which it will check againli ol  pHave I misunderstood things Is what Im asking how it actually works, or do I have to do something differentp

Negative 69665 pI was wonder how Id update a specific well in a database the balance cell, when all I know is the users account number.p  pI dont know where about in the database this will be. I just know the account number exists as Ive logged in through it.p  pI need to use LINQ for this, and Ive tried querying the database to find the balance. Although, I want to update the balance to a specific value, not find the current value.p  pIn SQL, Id do something likep  precodeUPDATE UserData SET Balance  some value in this case an int being passed in WHERE AccNo  the accountNumber variable stored in a global class codepre  pBut the problem is the value is stored in a dataset as the client is working offline with the data. His dataset is updated in the SQL database once he logs out. I was going to do this by retrieving everything from the database and going an updatemerge statement.p  pAny idea how to resolve thisp

Negative 69665 pI have an Azurehosted API that accepts loggingtracing data from multiple customer applications for the purpose of identifyingaggregating issues before the customer raises them in a support call.

Negative 69665 pI have an application in which I want to have strict separation between backend and frontendGUI.p  pThe backend is the application logic with cpp classes and the frontend are QML files with some cpp classes which mainly works as adapters to the backend.p  pNow I was wondering if it is okay to have classes derived from QAbstractModel in the backend form a design point of view.p  pMy first thought was that they should NOT belong to the backend because they are just a wrapper around some Qt Container classes to reflect their data in the GUI. So a pointer to the actual data can be injected and they should only be used in the frontend for displaying purpose but they should not be used anywhere in the backend.p  pThe Qt Container classes of course should belong to the backend.p  pNow I also need some conversion and utilities functions which act and maybe modifies the data of the containers. Therefore I wrote a handler class. But now it is starting to get tricky to keep everything in sync especially without getting bindingloops.p  pThe other solution would be to have a class derived from QAbstractModel which wraps the data and also have these conversion and utilities functions. They could then call the dataChanged etc. functions. Then I could use this class also in the backend. But would that be good design or should the backend be free of QAbstractModel derived classesp  pSince I find it quite difficult to express my issue clearly, I hope my question is understandable in some way p
