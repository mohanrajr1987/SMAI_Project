Positive 4367 pI have a Wordpress site that uses Woocommerce and Paypal. Ive setup a sandbox to be able to test Paypal purchases.p  pWhen the order goes through, I end up on a Paypal strongThanks for your orderstrong page which is fine except that it gives a link which states, strongReturn to  lt email addressstrong.  The text of the link is confusing.  Id like it to say, strongReturn to lt Business Namestrong. p  pIve seen other questions about this online and all the answers say upgrade Paypal to a business account.  I already have a business account and Ive filled out the profile properly, but I cant get it to say strongReturn to lt Business Name strong.  Any help would be greatly appreciated.  Thanks.p

Positive 4367 pI am getting a problem with the PayPal REST Api, sometimes it works fine and on sandbox it works 100 But on the live system when connecting to the live PayPal system. I sometimes get the follow error. p  precodePayPal.ConnectionException Invalid HTTP response The request was aborted Could not create SSLTLS secure channel. at  PayPal.Api.HttpConnection.ExecuteString payLoad, HttpWebRequest      httpRequest at PayPal.Api.PayPalResource.ConfigureAndExecute[T]     APIContext apiContext, HttpMethod httpMethod, String resource, String      payload, String endpoint, Boolean setAuthorizationHeader at      PayPal.Api.OAuthTokenCredential.GenerateOAuthToken at      PayPal.Api.OAuthTokenCredential.GetAccessToken codepre  pBasically is just keep crashing when trying to get the access token from PayPalp  pI have updated the SDK to the latest version and the code had been happily working for 3 months.p
Positive 4367 pSo, heres my challenge I have to build a webservice which handles payments using PayPal... The SOAP way Since Im a Node developer Im very familiar with REST but the challenge is that I have to build it with Java, XMLschemas and SOAP using the Springframework.  Now I found this workflow when using REST a hrefhttpsdevtoolspaypal.comguidepaypaypaljavainteractiveONampenvsandbox relnofollowhttpsdevtoolspaypal.comguidepaypaypaljavainteractiveONampenvsandboxa. That looks easy as pie to me But what would this workflow look like when using SOAP and how would you implement this. As in How do you handle redirects and responseURLs Or is the workflow differentp  pP.S. I know PayPal has lots and lots of documentation but when it comes to SOAP, I just cant figure out the workflow or how to handle responseURLs..p  pThnx in advancep

Positive 4367 pI have an application, which needs to send gift payment to unregistered in PayPal users through their email after delay specified by gift sender.p  pCan i create PayPal Chained Payment to unregistered in PayPal user as receiver p
Positive 4367 pWe have a form that allows users to setup recurring payments. Recurring payments are done using PayPal accounts. Often times users will checkout as a guest, and will pay for the initial installment and will not register using a PayPal account. The end results of this is that the recurring payments arent being made, as they have used a credit card for their paymeent, and they dont login and approve their recurring transactions.p  pIs it possible to disable checkout as a guest for recurring payments on a per checkout basis We dont want this on an account basis, as there are other scenarios where we do want to allow checkout as guest.p
Positive 4367 pCreating a buy now button with the button builder on the paypal website only allows you to create a button that will send the user to the paypal website for checking out with paypal.  p  pIm using the nodejs SDK to directly accept credit cards and prevent the user from having to leave my website in order to complete the payment.  My question is stronghow can I create a paypal button that calls the appropriate function in my application when the button is clicked instead of taking the user to a paypal payment pagestrong p  pIm assuming that when the payment button is clicked it ought to trigger a function in my application that creates the payment using the nodejs paypal restSDK module instead of sending the user to the paypal website. p  pThe problem is that I could create any old button, but to comply with paypals developer agreement it seems you have to use their buttons.  The only solution Ive thought of is to download one of their button image files from their website. This image could then be used to make a button that calls the appropriate function.  Would this be okay p

Negative 4367 pA bit of history We have an application, which was originally written many years ago 1998 is the first date in PVCS but the app is about 5 years older than that as it originally was a DOS program. This application communicates with a piece of hardware via serial. When we got to Windows XP we started receiving reports of the app dying after a short time of running. It seems that the serial comms just died and the app was left in a stuck state. The only way to recover from this situation was to restart the application.p  pThe only information I can find regarding this problem was apparently the Windows Message system would miss that information was received, the buffer would fill and the system would get stuck. This snippet of information was left in a old word document, but theres no evidence to back this up. It also mentions that this is only prevalent at high baud rates 115200.p  pThe solution was to provide customers with USBSerial converters along with the hardware.p  pToday We are working on a new version of the hardware that will run across a network as well as serial ports. So to allow me to work on the network code, minus the actual hardware we are using a a hrefhttpwww.vscom.de666.htm relnofollowVSCOM NetCom113a device. It also installs a virtual comm port on the users ie mine machine.p  pNow I have got the network code integrated with the app, it appears that the NetCom device exhibits the same behaviour as a physical commport. This is undesirable as I need the app to run longer than 30 seconds.p  pGoogle turns up zero problems that we experience.p  pI was wondering p  ul liHas anyone experienced this before If so what did you do to fixworkaround the problemli liDoes anyone have any suggestions as to whether the original author of the document is correct and what I can do to test the theoryli ul  pUnfortunately I cant post code as the serial code is tightly couple with the rest of the system, though if you have questions regarding it I can answer questions about it. p  pstrongUpdatesstrongp  ul liThe code is written using Win32 Comm routines  so I am using CreateFile, ReadFile. Theres also judicious calls to GetOverlappedResult.li liIts not hanging per se, its just that the comms stops. You can access the menus, click the buttons, but nothing can interact with the connected hardware. Using a hrefhttprealterm.sourceforge.net relnofollowrealterma you can see that no data is coming in or going out.li liI think the reference to the windows message is that the problem is internal to windows. Data has arrived but the kernal has missed it and thus not told the rest of the system about it.li liFlow control is not used.li liWriting a simple test is difficult due the the fact that the code is tightly coupled and the underlying protocol is quite complex and would require a lot of work.li ul

Negative 4367 pAs an exercise, and mostly for my own amusement, Im implementing a backtracking packrat parser.  The inspiration for this is id like to have a better idea about how hygenic macros would work in an algollike language as apposed to the syntax free lisp dialects you normally find them in.  Because of this, different passes through the input might see different grammars, so cached parse results are invalid, unless I also store the current version of the grammar along with the cached parse results.  emEDITem a consequence of this use of keyvalue collections is that they should be immutable, but I dont intend to expose the interface to allow them to be changed, so either mutable or immutable collections are finep  pThe problem is that python dicts cannot appear as keys to other dicts.

Negative 4367 pIm having a hell of a time with our build scripts right now Im using a hrefhttpcode.google.compwaf relnofollowWafa to drive our build process, and everything works great, except on Windows, where I am getting intermitent errors during builds.p  pThe errors are always basically access denied errors of one form or another, relating to temporary files I have created during the build process to enable some tool to run and do its job.  For example, before running a hrefhttpnsis.sourceforge.netMain5FPage relnofollowNSISa to generate an executable installer, I have to stage all the required files to the build directory and run the command from there.  Sometimes things work as expected, but other times I get an error reported about one of the files I have copied for example p  pcodeFile failed opening file PlatformWin32lxml2.2.1py2.6win32.eggcodep  pIve spent an age trying to work out what the issue is but its really difficult because the issue is intermittent. The last thing I tried is using a hrefhttptechnet.microsoft.comenussysinternalsbb896645.aspx relnofollowprocmona to monitor filesystem access to try to trace what was causing the access error I know the file is there so it must be that something has the file open.  Im including the relevant output below because I cant see what is wrong Python seems to be closing the file before NSIS wants to open it but then NSIS is failing.  Can anyone shed any light on this  This issue is not isolated to this situation but also to other cases where I spawn subprocesses to work with files I have copied to build directories...p  precode73515.9704427 PM  python.exe4968QueryOpen..PathToBuildlxml2.2.1py2.6win32.eggFAST IO DISALLOWED 73515.9707497 PM  python.exe4968CreateFile..PathToBuildlxml2.2.1py2.6win32.eggSUCCESSDesired Access Read Attributes, Disposition Open, Options Open Reparse Point, Attributes na, ShareMode Read, Write, Delete, AllocationSize na, OpenResult Opened 73515.9708634 PM  python.exe4968QueryBasicInformationFile..PathToBuildlxml2.2.1py2.6win32.eggSUCCESSCreationTime 7252009 73511 PM, LastAccessTime 7252009 73511 PM, LastWriteTime 7252009 73511 PM, ChangeTime 7252009 73511 PM, FileAttributes A 73515.9709271 PM  python.exe4968CloseFile..PathToBuildlxml2.2.1py2.6win32.eggSUCCESS 73515.9785180 PM  python.exe4968CreateFile..PathToBuildlxml2.2.1py2.6win32.eggSUCCESSDesired Access Write Attributes, Synchronize, Disposition Open, Options Synchronous IO NonAlert, Open Reparse Point, Attributes na, ShareMode Read, Write, Delete, AllocationSize na, OpenResult Opened 73515.9786119 PM  python.exe4968SetBasicInformationFile..PathToBuildlxml2.2.1py2.6win32.eggSUCCESSCreationTime 111601 10000 AM, LastAccessTime 111601 10000 AM, LastWriteTime 111601 10000 AM, ChangeTime 111601 10000 AM, FileAttributes AN 73515.9787155 PM  python.exe4968CloseFile..PathToBuildlxml2.2.1py2.6win32.eggSUCCESS 73515.9789401 PM  python.exe4968QueryOpen..PathToBuildlxml2.2.1py2.6win32.eggFAST IO DISALLOWED 73515.9790309 PM  python.exe4968CreateFile..PathToBuildlxml2.2.1py2.6win32.eggSUCCESSDesired Access Read Attributes, Disposition Open, Options Open Reparse Point, Attributes na, ShareMode Read, Write, Delete, AllocationSize na, OpenResult Opened 73515.9790700 PM  python.exe4968QueryBasicInformationFile..PathToBuildlxml2.2.1py2.6win32.eggSUCCESSCreationTime 7252009 73511 PM, LastAccessTime 7252009 73511 PM, LastWriteTime 7252009 73511 PM, ChangeTime 7252009 73512 PM, FileAttributes A 73515.9790952 PM  python.exe4968CloseFile..PathToBuildlxml2.2.1py2.6win32.eggSUCCESS 73515.9792809 PM  python.exe4968CreateFile..PathToBuildlxml2.2.1py2.6win32.eggSUCCESSDesired Access Write Attributes, Synchronize, Disposition Open, Options Synchronous IO NonAlert, Open Reparse Point, Attributes na, ShareMode Read, Write, Delete, AllocationSize na, OpenResult Opened 73515.9793270 PM  python.exe4968SetBasicInformationFile..PathToBuildlxml2.2.1py2.6win32.eggSUCCESSCreationTime 111601 10000 AM, LastAccessTime 111601 10000 AM, LastWriteTime 111601 10000 AM, ChangeTime 111601 10000 AM, FileAttributes AN 73515.9794041 PM  python.exe4968CloseFile..PathToBuildlxml2.2.1py2.6win32.eggSUCCESS 73516.3508170 PM  makensis.exe3296CreateFile..PathToBuildlxml2.2.1py2.6win32.eggSHARING VIOLATIONDesired Access Generic Read, Disposition Open, Options Sequential Access, Synchronous IO NonAlert, NonDirectory File, Attributes N, ShareMode Read, AllocationSize na 73516.3557763 PM  python.exe4968QueryOpen..PathToBuildlxml2.2.1py2.6win32.eggFAST IO DISALLOWED 73516.3558928 PM  python.exe4968CreateFile..PathToBuildlxml2.2.1py2.6win32.eggSUCCESSDesired Access Read Attributes, Disposition Open, Options Open Reparse Point, Attributes na, ShareMode Read, Write, Delete, AllocationSize na, OpenResult Opened 73516.3559461 PM  python.exe4968QueryNetworkOpenInformationFile..PathToBuildlxml2.2.1py2.6win32.eggSUCCESSCreationTime 7252009 73511 PM, LastAccessTime 7252009 73511 PM, LastWriteTime 7252009 73511 PM, ChangeTime 7252009 73512 PM, AllocationSize 111601 10000 AM, EndOfFile 111601 10000 AM, FileAttributes A 73516.3560121 PM  python.exe4968CloseFile..PathToBuildlxml2.2.1py2.6win32.eggSUCCESS 73516.3562048 PM  python.exe4968CreateFile..PathToBuildlxml2.2.1py2.6win32.eggSHARING VIOLATIONDesired Access Read Attributes, Delete, Disposition Open, Options NonDirectory File, Open Reparse Point, Attributes na, ShareMode Read, Write, Delete, AllocationSize na 73521.9320579 PM  python.exe3160CloseFile..PathToBuildlxml2.2.1py2.6win32.eggSUCCESS codepre

Negative 4367 pOk,p  pLast time I posted this last week, I didnt describe the problem correctly.  I have created a quick sample of this problem.  Querying local collections work fine with you are using it as part of the base query.  The problem I am finding is using it with part of a sub query. For example.p  pThis is fairly hard to describe without giving you guys a database diagram, or code diagram, but I will try my best.  I am trying to execute my code with one query to the db.  I dont want to have to break it down and send multiple commands. Doing it that way has some advantages, including a avoiding a possible problem which I will explain towards the end of this.p  pI am joining some tables that have a relationship.  The attributes DataEventAttributes table of course describes attributes that are unique to a specific row in the main table DataEvents.  p  pWhen I query it without any local collection, thing work fine and extremely fast against my 20 gig database.   However, if I throw a local collection of values into part of the sub query that gets the results, I will get the Queries with local collections are not supportedp  pThis was fairly hard for me to reproduce in my code, so I will comment it as well as I can do you can follow what I am doing.p  precode gets the initial query and join. We actually only care about the ID in the end, but we use the joined data          to determine if a row needs to be pulled.         var initialQuery  from dataEvent in DataEvent.GetByQueryExpressioncontext                                   join attribute in DataEventAttribute.GetByQueryExpressioncontext on dataEvent.DataEventID                                       equals attribute.DataEventID                            select new                                                            ID  dataEvent.DataEventID,                                PluginID  dataEvent.DataOwnerID,                                TimeStamp  dataEvent.DataTimeStamp,                                DataEventKeyID  attribute.DataEventKeyID,                                ValueString  attribute.ValueString,                                ValueDecimal  attribute.ValueDecimal                                       list of some ids that we need to confirm exist in the initial query before the final query         var someSetOfIDs  new Listltintgt 1, 2, 3, 4, 5           This is the local collection thats filtering out some results before I rebuild the entire result set in the final query          If you comment this line out, the finalQuery will execute just fine.          with this in place, the Queries with local collections are not supported error will come about.         initialQuery  initialQuery.Wherex gt x.DataEventKeyID  1 ampamp someSetOfIDs.Containsint x.ValueDecimal           reusable query for the sub queries in the results  not part of the problem, just part of the example         var attributeBaseQuery  from attribute in DataEventAttribute.GetByQueryExpressioncontext select attribute           Builds the final result With the IDs from the initial query           the group by is to remove any duplicates that may be in the collection.          the select key is getting the ID that i needed          the select ID is the ID of the first item that was grouped.          the contains compares the local dataEvent object with the ID table checking to see if it exists          the result is just an example of one item I can be pulling out of the database with the new type         var finalQuery  from dataEvent in DataEvent.GetByQueryExpressioncontext                          where initialQuery.GroupByx gt x.Selectx gt x.Key.Selectx gt x.ID.ContainsdataEvent.DataEventID                          select new                                                                              BasicData                                           attributeBaseQuery.Where                                          attrValue gt                                          attrValue.DataEventID  dataEvent.DataEventID ampamp                                          attrValue.DataEventKeyID  short DataEventTypesEnum.BasicData.FirstOrDefault.

One, it runs that query first, and gets the IDs from the database.. then it has to pass those results back to the sql server as parameters to the finalQuery.  The second major show stopper, is that if there are to many results from the .ToList, SQL server will throw some strange error message and Google searches show that there are to many parameters being passed which would make sense, because the parameter count could be in the 10100s of thousands.p  pSo, that said, I am trying to figure out how to build a query that I can adjust the criteria dynamically, and then rebuild my result sets with all the attributes that match the ID that meets the criteria of the sub query.  In SQL server via the studio, this works fine, but the collection issue has me on a holdup.p  pI have tried many different ways, but it seems the only way to reproduce this is to have a query that uses a local collection, and then use that query as part of another query that filters the results using the first query.  p  pAny ideas how I can do thisp  pa hrefhttpwww.traviswhidden.comPortals15BlogImagesQueriesWithLocalCollections.jpg relnofollowScreen shot show you know Im not crazy.ap  pThanks in advance for the helpp

Negative 4367 pIf you dont know what Im talking about either go through a hrefhttpwww.asp.netlearnmvctutorial30cs.aspxthe tutoriala and try to add dependency Injection yourself or try your luck with my explanation of the problem.p  pstrongNotestrong This problem isnt within the scope of the original tutorial on ASP.NET. The tutorial only suggests that the patterns used are dependency injection friendly.p  pThe problem is basically that there is a dependency loop between the Controller, the ModelStateWrapper and the ContactManagerService.p  ol liThe ContactController constuctor takes an IContactManagerService.li liThe ContactManagerService constructor takes an IContactManagerRepository emnot importantem and an IValidationDictionary emwhich ModelStateWrapper implementsem.li liThe ModelStateWrapper constructor takes a ModelStateDictionary emwhich is a property called ModelState on the controllerem.li ol  pSo the dependency cycle goes like this Controller  Service  ModelStateWrapper  Controllerp  pIf you try to add dependency injection to this, it will fail. So my question is what should I do about it Others have posted this question, but the answers are few, different, and all seem kinda hackish.p  pMy current solution is to remove the IModelStateWrapper from the IService constructor and add an Initialize method instead like thisp  precodepublic class ContactController  Controller      private readonly IContactService contactService      public ContactControllerIContactService contactService              contactService  contactService         contactService.Initializenew ModelStateWrapperModelState           Class implementation...   public class ContactService  IContactService      private IValidationDictionary validationDictionary     private readonly IContactRepository contactRepository      public ContactServiceIContactRepository contactRepository              contactRepository  contactRepository           private void InitializeIValidationDictionary validationDictionary              ifvalidationDictionary  null             throw new ArgumentNullExceptionvalidationDictionary          validationDictionary  validationDictionary           Class implementation...   public class ModelStateWrapper  IValidationDictionary      private readonly ModelStateDictionary modelState      public ModelStateWrapperModelStateDictionary modelState              modelState  modelState           Class implementation...  codepre  pWith this construct I can configure my unity container like thisp  precodepublic static void ConfigureUnityContainer      IUnityContainer container  new UnityContainer       Registrations     container.RegisterTypeInHttpRequestLifetimeltIContactRepository, EntityContactRepositorygt     container.RegisterTypeInHttpRequestLifetimeltIContactService, ContactServicegt      ControllerBuilder.Current.SetControllerFactorynew UnityControllerFactorycontainer  codepre  pUnfortunately this means that the Initialize method on the service has to be called emmanuallyem by the controller constructor. Is there a better way Maybe where I somehow include the IValidationDictionary in my unity configuration Should I switch to another DI container Am I missing somethingp

Negative 4367 pTwo of my users have reported a problem with my Android application, OftSeen Gestures. Both of them are using a Motorola Droid. The app saves a text file which is just a list of gesture names and phone numbers, both strings. It saves the file to the private data area. I dont know that it is this code that is failing but they report the assigned numbers disappearing after the phone comes out of screen sleep. Since the file is reread in OnCreate each time, Im assuming the file doesnt exist on return.p  pAs soon as I can get my hands on a Droid I will debug it but in the meantime can you see a reason why this save operation would fail on Droid no other users have reported thisp  precode    OutputStreamWriter out  new OutputStreamWriterAppGlobal.getContext.openFileOutputMAPPINGSFILENAME, 0      for String key  mMap.keySet          String number  mMap.getkey.number         out.writeString.formats,sn, key, number  null    number          out.close codepre  pAppGlobal.getContext returns the application context and the MAPPINGSFILENAME resolves to gesturemappings.txt.p  pLike I say, I dont know that this is the problem.

Negative 4367 pI am creating an iPad application using a UISplitView. I used the default template for that type of application in Xcode. The UISplitView has a left pane menu or list and a right pane detail or content view in it. Each has a navigation bar at the top of the view.p  pWhat I want to do is move with animation both views to the left so that the list pane is hidden and I can have more controls appear at the right. Please dont tell me I am going against the HIG, I am sure I am, but for what I am doing it makes perfect sense and this is how I want to do it.p  pThe problem is that, after animating the slide across, I am left with little dots at the top and bottom of the screen where the dividing line used to be. The dots are obviously there to curve the corners of the nav bars when they are in the correct place, but now they are just in the way, but I dont know what view they are in or where I can find them. I either want to remove them just before the animation or just disable them completely.p  pHere is a screenshot of the problem a hrefhttpcl.ly1WEC relnofollowhttpcl.ly1WECa You can see the dots in the middle of the picture.

Negative 4367 pI am running a background worker thread that takes a long time to run.p  pThe actual function stores the folder structure of a location, but we can take an example of the following pseudo code running in a different thread p  precodeprivate int currentResult0 private void worker      forint n  0 nlt1000 n              int result          Do some time consuming computation and update the result         currentResult  result       codepre  pThis is running in a codeBackgroundWorkercode thread. Can I read the codecurrentResultcode from another thread safelyp  pEditp  pKeyword codevolatilecode seems like a magic solution thanks Jon I am planning to pass a codestringcode with a message in this way from the worker class to the UI.p  pYou might be wondering why I dont use codeReportProgresscode. The reason is that the codeBackgroundWorker.DoWorkcode creates an object of a different class, and calls a method there which does bulk of the work. This method is time consuming. The class is one to get the directory structure, and many related methods in it which the main computing method depends on. So this class does not even know existance of the background worker, and hence cannot report progress to it. Moving functionality of the class to codeBackgroundWorkercode seems messy. If this strikes as a bad design I am open to suggestionsp

Negative 4367 pI have a grid of 3D terrain, where each of the coordinate codex,y,zcode of each grid are known.

And then I would segmentize the line based on the grid in the terrain.

If no, then I would proceed to the next segment.p  pBut is my algorithm the best, or the most optimum solution Or is there any existing libraries that already do thisp

Negative 4367 pIm relatively new to dependency injection, so Im probably butchering the concept to some extent. However, Im trying to achieve something like the following, but am unsure as to whether or not its feasiblep  pLets say I have two containers, each containing different instances of the same type of dependency. For example, each contains a different emsingleem instance of codeMyApplicationContextcode and codeMyRequestContextcode.p  pNow lets say I have several classes which depend on one or both of these instances. They shouldnt be concerned with which of the two containers they use they simply require an instance of the dependency to get the job done. p  pIn an ideal world, each of these dependable classes makes a static call in its constructor, which in turn reflectively injects the dependencies from strongan appropriate containerstrong...p  precodepublic class MyDependableClass   protected MyApplicationContext Application get set   protected MyRequestContext Request get set   public MyDependableClass      Dependencies.Injectthis     codepre  pHowever, AFAIK theres no practical way of determining an strongappropriatestrong container. Ive considered registering each object against a particular container e.g. codecontainer.Registerobjcode , but this would be laborious and wouldnt work if dependencies were required in the constructor. Alternatively you could analyze the call stack to infer the container from a registered toplevel object... wouldnt work for asynchronous calls, etcp  pAny ideasp  pstrongExamplestrong I may have several classes which can depend on an instance of a proxy lets call it codeILogicProxycode. This proxy may forward calls to either local logic or remote logic on another machine. Furthermore, the application may establish connections with several remote machines. So... we have potentially multiple codeILogicProxycode instances which need to be injected into several classes... but which one goes where A solution like this could just use simple setter property injection, however this doesnt scale when more dependencies are required, since it will cause the wiring up process to become messyverbose.p

Negative 4367 psorry in advance for my poor grammar.p  pI have created a pipeline with GATE API, i run it successfully. I created a serialanalysercontroller like this pipeline  SerialAnalyserControllerFactory.createResourcegate.creole.SerialAnalyserController , then i load a corpus of files previously populatedp  ppipeline.setCorpusfoo and last, pipeline.execute. p  pIt all works great and i see the results. My problem is that i cannot find the way to get the AnnotationSet for each document that was processed in the corpus. For example i want to find the AnnotationSet sentences to find in which offsets the sentences start and stop in the original text file. The API does not tell how I will get the annotations from the SerialAnalyserController  how to get each gate.Document after the process pipeline has finished.p  pThanks in advancep
Negative 4367 pIm migrating an application from a homegrown UI to Qt. One of the most important controls is the property panel, which takes an object that implements my reflection apis interface and spits out a dialog box containing editors for all the properties.p  pIve written an implementation of QAbstractItemModel for my property system and Ive written a few handlers for various types inside of a QTableView. Ive also written a QItemDelegate to create editors for the properties.p  pThe trouble is that Id like the editors to hang around, rather than be strictly popups. This is so that they can handle the rendering of the property, require less clicks to operate and also not disappear as soon as something else gets the focus, such as my colour button  the editor which has the slots listening for colour changes disappears as soon as the colour picker dialog appears, which means that nothing is then listening for changes.p  pI cant find any options for making the editors persist. Am I barking up the wrong tree here or is there a more appropriate way of doing this Ive tried to do things the Qt way but Im already hitting brick walls.p  pThanks,p

The application is just for testing atm, so it all it contains is an ActionBar with a refresh button, three tabs, and an activity for each of those tabs. p  pAll Im trying to achieve at the minute is showing a toast message when the refresh button is pressed on the ActionBar, but I want the toast message to be called from within one of my activities, well call it Listener1Activity which is the activity that sits in the first tab ... this is because Listener1Activity will eventually contain a list that I want to reload when the ActionBar button is pressed, if I can get it working with a simple toast message for now then I can sort out that later. p  pIve looked into intents, broadcasts, but nothing seems to fit.p  pI emdontem want the activity starting new each time the button is pressed, I just want a method in it to call and show the toast. p  pSo basically, its just like having 2 activities running at the same time, and a button press in one calling a method in the other. Isnt it Or have I got that wrongp  pSenderActivity and Listener1Activity. p  pIn iOS, I would just send an NSNotification from SenderActivity, and add an observer in Listener1Activity.

Negative 4367 pI have a website with its own loginregistration mechanism PHP, session, user and userprofile DB tables with username and password, etc. Lets call this the ABC account.p  pI just finished integrating Twitters signon using Oauth, available as a signon using twitter button above my normal login form. p  pSo now I have this scenariop  pA user logs on via Twitter. Because Twitter, unlike Facebook, does not proivde access to a users email address, I dont know if this person who logged in via Twitter is an existing user in my user table or not. So I create a new account for them lets call this the Twitter account and prompt them to merge with an existing ABC account by entering their ABC credentials. If they do so and everything matches, I store their twitter username, id and token in the DB record for their ABC account. Next time they login via Twitter I know who they are in terms of the ABC account ie, the accounts are merged and all is good p  pExcept, Id like to have the ability to have my site send tweets on their behalf, which basically means I need an authorized Twitter connection, which I only have if they logon via the Twitter button, not through the ABC account. The reason is with the latter I have their tokensecret, received from the Twitter API callback after signing, but with the former I dont. My first thought of course was to save the tokensecret in my DB with the ABC account record to remove this restriction, however it seems like this is the equivalent of a password and storing it could be secruity hole p  pTo boil this down to a question is it standard practice to store the oauth token secret in the DB to achieve what Im trying to do which itself seems like a pretty standard function for a modern site . If not, whats an alternative implementation p  pUpdate looking at a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions879430bestpracticesstoretwittercredentialsornotBest practices  store Twitter credentials or nota it seems this is definitely emnotem a best practice. But it seems like what Im trying to accomplish is...not sure how to implement Maybe some kind of cookiebased solutionp  pPeterp  pps  BTW, if anyone has a better way to do the account merge I described Id be open hearing about that as well. I did some google searching but really couldnt find anything too useful, although this problem must have been solved many times I imagine My understanding is that in the Facebook case the email can be used to uniqely identify a user ie, match them to an ABC account, and do the merge without prompting although Im not even sure this is totally secure.p

For example, Key0. To include   the NULL at the end, the length of the   Unicode string is specified as 4.   There is absolutely no way to specify   this name using the Win32 API since if   Key0 is passed as a name, the API   will determine that the name is Key   3 characters in length because the   0 indicates the end of the name.p      pWhen a key or any other object with a   name such as a named Event, Semaphore,   or Mutex is created with such a name,   any application using the Win32 API   will be unable to open the name, even   though they might seem to see it.p blockquote  pso I tried doing something similarp  precodeHKEY keyHandle PHKEY key unsigned long status  0  wchart wKeyName  new wchart[mkeyLength] MultiByteToWideCharCPACP, 0, mkeyName, mkeyLength, wKeyName, mkeyLength wKeyName[18]  0 long result  RegCreateKeyExWHKEYLOCALMACHINE,                                wKeyName,                               0,                               NULL,                               0,                               KEYALLACCESS,                               NULL,                               ampkeyHandle,                               ampstatus codepre  pwhere codemkeyNamecode is the ASCII text and wKeyName is the wide char text, but in coderegeditcode I see that it is treated the same and the key is just cut where I put the 0.  p  pwhat is wrong with itp

Negative 4367 pAs a canonical example, consider the problem of argumentreduction for trigonometric functions, as in computing x mod 2 as a first step for computing sinx. This kind of problem is difficult in that you cant just use codefmodcode, because y 2 in the example is not representible.p  pI came up with a simple solution that works for arbitrary values y, not just 2, and Im curious how it compares in performance with typical argumentreduction algorithms.p  pThe basic idea is to store a table containing the value of 2supnsup mod y for each value n in the range log2y to the maximum possible floating point exponent, then using the linearity of modular arithmetic, sum the values in this table over bits that are set in the value of x. It amounts to N branches and at most N additions, where N is the number of mantissa bits in your floating point type. The result is not necessarily less than y, but its bounded by Ny, and the procedure can be applied again to give a result thats bounded by log2Ny or codefmodcode can simply be used at this point with minimal error.p  pCan this be improved And do the typical trigonometric argument reduction algorithms work for arbitrary y or only for 2p
Negative 4367 pHow should I train my users not to double click links p  pThe backend protects itself against it, but usually these checks lead to ugly error messages XY already in state completed etc. At some places I remove the buttonimage when the user clicked it, but for normal links this would look pretty ugly.p  pIdeas so far p  ul liJust ignore the click solves problem, but no trainingli liShow alertli liShow overlayli liShow overlay with shocking image.. or lolcat no click double pliiizli liplay soundli ul  pWhats your treatment for this disease.p  pThanksp  pstrongEdit Notestrongp  pFor the past two years I implemented the usual solution for this problem remove buttons, gray out, deactivate, etc. just not on all linksbuttonsetc. But again and again I find subtle, hardtotrack bugs caused by doubleclicks, which I personally, as the developer, never trigger, just because I dont double click.

Negative 4367 pI was wondering if there is any way to be notified automatically by android when the onscreen keyboard is shown and when it disappears.p  pFor example when we click on a edittext, the ime appears. Will there be any event calls And when it disappears when we press back, similarly will there be any even callsp  pI found this thread a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions4268820androidwhicheventfireswhenonscreenkeyboardappearsAndroid which event fires when on screen keyboard appearsa , however no answers have been reached yet.p  pThe purpose is because i need an event to automatically manipulate visibility. I have an activity with an edittext on the top of the screen, below it, a listview and a linearlayout which are sitting on top of each other. To control what the user sees, i manipulate the visibility. By default, the linearlayout is shown initially, however, when the user is entering text, the listview should be shown instead. The listview should disappear when the user has finished typing, which in this case, the onscreenkeyboard will be closed.p  pI tried acomplishing the change of visibility using onFocusChange, however, even when the onscreen keyboard disappears, the edittext still retains focus and the linearlayout never reappears.p  pBelow is my implementation of the onFocusChangep  precodeOverride public void onFocusChangeView v, boolean hasFocus       ifv.getIdR.id.searchscreenkeywordtextbox              ifhasFocus                      filterSection.setVisibilityView.GONE             autoComSection.setVisibilityView.VISIBLE                  else                      filterSection.setVisibilityView.VISIBLE             autoComSection.setVisibilityView.GONE                          else ifv.getIdR.id.searchscreenlocationtextbox              ifhasFocus                      filterSection.setVisibilityView.GONE              autoComSection.setVisibilityView.VISIBLE                  else                      filterSection.setVisibilityView.VISIBLE             autoComSection.setVisibilityView.GONE                   else              filterSection.setVisibilityView.VISIBLE         autoComSection.setVisibilityView.GONE       codepre  pIf anyone has any idea about it do let me know.

Negative 4367 pI am making a very simple game, but I cannot decide on how to store the variables my custom classes will use. I only know of two ways to do this, but other people seem to have rules about where you put certain things. I would like to know how I should store the variables I am using efficiently, and I was hoping I could get the answer here.p  pBasically, this is my header file.p  precodeimport ltFoundationFoundation.hgt import URWInventoryView.h  interface RWInventory  NSObject      URWInventoryView inventoryWindow      BOOL slotIsOccupied[5][5]      int numberOfSlots     int numberOfSlotsFilled     int numberOfColumns     int numberOfRows      Initializers     id initWithSlotsintslots  id initWithColumnsintcolumns andRowsintrows  id initWithInventoryDataRWInventoryinventory     Setters     void setSlotsintslots  void setColumnsintcolumns  void setRowsintrows   void setSlotIsOccupiedColumnintcolumn andRowint row  void moveItemAtColumnintcolumn andRowintrow toColumnintnewColumn andRowintnewRow     Getters     int slots  int columns  int rows   BOOL slotIsOccupiedColumnintcolumn andRowintrow  end codepre  pThat uses the first method I was kinda talking about earlier. The second method involves using a single codeNSDictionarycode between the codeimportcodes and the codeinterfacecode declaration, and they simply store each objects data in a key. The method used above sounds much easier and efficient to me.p  pPlease keep in mind that I will be using anywhere between five and twenty objects of this type. My last note codeURWInventoryViewcode is another one of my custom classes, and it is based on a UIView.p

Negative 4367 pI have been observing a strange behaviour in my axis2based 1.4.1 webapplication running in Websphere 7.  If my soapbased Webservicerequest is blocked in the serverthread for exactly 60 seconds, I receive the Webservicerequest again more specific my serverside SOAP message receiver is invoked again for that call the first thread is still blocking at this time and the client application has received a timeout already 30 seconds ago.p  pI have been trying to trace this down but did not succeed to understand the behaviour. Here are the facts that I have alreadyp  pstrongFact 1strong It only happens with SSL enabledp  pstrongFact 2strong The axis1based webserviceclient is not the one doing the retransmits neither is it the client at all. I have been sniffing the outgoing packets at the client and incoming packets at the server and even though I cannot see the contents, based on the time, the retransmit is not going over the network.p  pstrongFact 3strong based on Facts 12 The resend must be initiated somewhere between the NIC and JRE IBM JRocket 9 VM on the SERVERside.p  pInitially this problem happend in my application beacause the call was blocking on a databaserequest but I have been simulation it with setting a breakpoint in the server for this request.p  pSorry that I cannot provide any useful traceslogs to back up my facts, but I was hoping that I might be missing something fairly obvious here... Obviously, the application layer should not see any retransmits tcp should know what packages have been delivered to the upper layer so, i would assume the problem could be somewhere close to the HTTPS protocol layer implementation in javap  pAlso, any good idea how to track this down would be highly appreciated. SSL beeing involved in the problem makes it all a litte harder...p  pemstrongEditemstrong I just did some more test and can now add some more facts to the equationp  pemstrongFact 4emstrong To be really sure it is not comiming from the client, I unplugged the networkcable after sending the first webservicerequest. The retransmit happend so, it is definitvley happening at serverside.p  pemstrongFact 5emstrong I added a servletfilter to see if it is triggered for the retransmit. It is so, the retransmit must be, like expected, triggered between NIC and servelt engine on the server somewhere in the JVM runtime or at TCP level.p  pemstrongFact 6emstrong The retransmit only happens if other data is going to the same TCPport in between. I.e. if i do not send some additional packagesrequests after the initial webservicerequest, the retransmit does not happen. Does this help to explain it with some problems in teh TCP layer p  pI am running a rather older RedHat Enterprise Linux Linux 2.6.989.ELp  pThanks in advance, Danielp

Basically we had one giant table for every transaction payments, credits, charges, fees,etc and it got out of hand because there were always a great deal of fields that werent used for each type  so we split the basic types up.p  pFor some reason, despite the better organization of the newer table system all in the same database, mind you, and the similarities between the queries, the older transaction query runs much faster. The transaction table returns the result in 0.004 seconds while the payments query takes 0.303.  In some areas on the web application e.g. listings for multiple groups, this translates into 40 second page load times as opposed to under 3.p  pIs there a single field or multifield index I might want to use  Can I further optimize the new queryp  pThis is running on MySQL 5.0.92p  pstrongEDIT 1strong I currently have singlefield indexes on transactions transactionid, memberid and payments id, memberid.  Unfortunately I only have access to PHPMYADMIN on this particular server and the EXPLAIN output isnt readily copyable.  That said, I can see a difference on the transaction query in that it says using whereusing index on the mtg table whereas the payment transaction simply says using where.p

Negative 4367 pIm trying to just do some simple user input using jquery loaded views.  In this example, I have a simple button on a web page that sends an ajax request to load a view containing a form into a div, which works fine.

This query gets built in a particular way by the framework so facing some constraints. A possible solution that cannot be easily implemented would be to change this to a UNION. Would like to avoid that route. In the past did a where...in clause but that performed even worse. I can add to the join, where clause, or manipulate indexes as needed but any other drastic changes to the query structure cannot be easily done.p

Negative 4367 pI have problem detecting the loss of socket connection in CF app for PDA device. I have static class that has static methods for communication Connect, Write, Disconnect. Static because all forms can call Write method.p  pIn Connect method i call socket.ConnectipEndpoint  But when device hasnt got wifi connection program halts at this line for about 20 s which is too long. Also if user starts Write method saving some data and wifi connection is lost, user cannot interact with form and thinks that application frizzed. Since there is no timeout option for CF socket connection, what is the best way to control socket behavior  My idea is to show some kind of  Communication form when socket doesnt response for 5 seconds which will try to reestablish connection. This form will have graphical indicator rotating clock or something like that to show user that program is trying to connect and exit button if user decides to exit app. If socket.connect succeeds, i will show last used form to user. I assume that this has to be done with Threads, but since i dont have experience with it. i need help how to manage this behavior.p

Also, are other factors like the country in which the user reside play a role prehashing or posthashing, in other words are other metrics besides the text of the query included in the hashp  pIn Java the function codehashCodecode can be used to find the hash corresponding to the object passed as the implicit parameter.

Negative 4367 pThe following techstack SOAPJNAWin DLLs is a triplewhammy to me, so speak softly and use small words, please p  pstrongEDITEDstrong The basic goal is to somehow get clientlocal file data across a remote web service, which provides JNA access to a DLL written in C that needs the file data.  I can fiddle with the DLL code if needed, but I am not so much a C programmer for the past several decades.p  pLonger version We have Ccode that has been converted from a standalone application to a set of DLLs in hopes of converting the functionality into a set of services.  We have access to the C code and the ability to further change as necessary. But we are a Java shop and so there is not a wealth of C experience here especially myself, so I hope to do the least amount of surgery on the C code.  I would also rather avoid trying to convert the core of the working missioncritical C code to Java, for fear of breaking it in the process.  But I am trying to write SOAP web services to access the DLL functionality remotely through multiple clients.  Someone initially wrote a JNA layer to access one of the simpler static interfaces.  But some of the modes of the old C application read an arbitrary number of files currently local to the client from a clientprovided file list.p  pI am trying to figure what kind of options there are for sending text file data through my JNA interface, and what is required of the client to send the files.  I saw a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions1337525passinputstreamthroughjnatoccodeasafilepointeranother SO questiona indicating that sending Java codeInputStreamcodes as C FILE pointers is an unlikely or impossible route to go.  The JNA example interfaces I have seen so far for tasks other than file transfer define Java classes extending codeStructurecode with presized byte[] array fields for sending string data  my files are text files.  But I do not know how many files will be found in the file list nor what the size of each file is going to be.p  pWould the JNA codePointercode come to my rescue somehow  How would the JNA codePointercode work across remote calls, and would it work with files directly or would I read in file contents into a codeStringBuffercode, convert to a dynamically sized byte array and pass a codePointercode  Does SAAJ come into play at allp

Negative 4367 pIm having issues with integrating facebook into my iOS app. When I launch my app, it redirects to the facebook app, which is good. But the auth dialog just vanishes from the screen like a dismissed modal view controller, the delegate methods arent firing, and Im left in the facebook app instead of being redirected back to my app. Im apparently not successfully initializing a session. I followed the steps in the iOS tutorial but I must have gone wrong somewhere. Most of the questions Ive seen have been about errors or trying to get different behavior out of the auth dialog. If this is a dupe, please direct me to the identical question because Im hitting a wall here. I have set up my .plist just as it says to in the tutorial. I used the bundle identifier for my app that I grabbed from iTunes connect. My constant kAppID is the AppID that I got from the Facebook Developer app interface. Having read through the headers and implementation files of the FB static lib, as well as FBs docs and tutorial, it seems to me that if all I want to do is redirect to FB app, sign in, and be redirected back to my own app, that these steps plus the code below should be sufficient.  p  pIn AppDelegate.mp  precode BOOLapplicationUIApplication application didFinishLaunchingWithOptionsNSDictionary launchOptions      kAppID  this is where my app ID is      Override point for customization after application launch.     facebook  [[Facebook alloc] initWithAppIdkAppID andDelegateself]     [facebook setSessionDelegateself]     return YES  codepre  pAnd in ViewController.m I grab a reference to that same instance of Facebook, and then call the followingp  precode voidloginToFacebookidsender      if [defaults objectForKeyFBAccessTokenKey] ampamp [defaults objectForKeyFBExpirationDateKey]          facebook.accessToken  [defaults objectForKeyFBAccessTokenKey]         facebook.expirationDate  [defaults objectForKeyFBExpirationDateKey]          if [facebook isSessionValid]          [facebook authorizenil]       codepre  pIs there some gotcha that Im not aware of Or maybe Im missing a critical step  Thanks in advance for any assistance. p  pOh, btw, Xcode 4.3.1, ios5SDK, iPhone 4S, ARC. p  pSS of .plist. img srchttpi.stack.imgur.comES1mg.png altenter image description herep  pAppDelegate.hp  precodeimport ltUIKitUIKit.hgt import Facebook.h import FBConnect.h  interface AppDelegate  UIResponder ltUIApplicationDelegategt      Facebook facebook     NSUserDefaults defaults     NSString kAppID   property strong, nonatomic UIWindow window property strong, nonatomic Facebook facebook property strong, nonatomic id delegate  end codepre  pAppDelegate.mp  precodeimport AppDelegate.h import ViewController.h  implementation AppDelegate  synthesize window  window synthesize facebook synthesize delegate   BOOLapplicationUIApplication application didFinishLaunchingWithOptionsNSDictionary launchOptions      ViewController viewController  [[ViewController alloc] init]     kAppID  385380598149062     facebook  [[Facebook alloc] initWithAppIdkAppID andDelegateviewController]      return YES    voidshowSession      NSLogFB Session , [NSNumber numberWithBool[facebook isSessionValid]]    voidapplicationWillResignActiveUIApplication application       Sent when the application is about to move from active to inactive state.

Negative 4367 pCurrently Im working on an assignment that requires that I create a program in which the user enters a number between 04. The program then checks which number the user inputs and outputs a specific string. For example if the user enters 4, the program will output 80 or above Level 4 p  pThe problem is that the user should also be able to quit the program. I decided to create the program so if the user inputs something that is not blank while input   the program will run, but if they decide to hit enter the program will end. p  pThis is the code Ive come up with so far p  precodedef getlevel     level  rawinputEnter a number from 04 Press ltEntergt to quit      return level  def checkmarklevel     if intlevel  4         print 80 or above Level 4     elif intlevel  3         print 70  79 Level 3     elif intlevel  2         print 60  69 Level 2     elif intlevel  1         print 50  59 Level 1     elif intlevel  0         print Below 50 Level 0     else         print ERROR out of range  def outputlevel    while level           level  rawinputEnter a number from 04 Press ltEntergt to quit          checkmarklevel         print  def main     userlevel  getlevel     usermark  checkmarkuserlevel     print     programoutput  outputuserlevel  main codepre  pIm pretty aware that the problem has to do with the fact that rawinput only accepts strings which is what activates the while level   statement. I tried working around this by placing int operators before each level. The problem is that it conflicts with the input if the user enters blank since it checks whether the input is an integer. Something like that anyways. p  pSo I was hoping someone could guide me to finding a way around this. It would be much appreciated p

If the accuracy is low, is still cell tower usedli ol  pIn my understanding, the accuracy of WIFI positioning is relatively high. But whats the normal range of the accuracy for it Another question, does Android use WIFI and cell tower at the same time If it does, then in my application, I can think it use WIFI, not cell tower.p  pThanksp
Negative 4367 pI have observed that when there is no recent ParNew and then if the CMSInitialMark phase kicksin, the CMSInitialMark phase takes longer time to mark the objects in old generation.p  pThe good part is most of the times I found ParNew may be by chance or JVM does this internally occurs just before CMSInitialMark phase and then to mark the same number of objects in old generation, the CMS takes less time.p  pWould like to know the reasoning behind this observation.p  pNote Considering, CMSInitialMark phase is stoptheworld, the best attempt should be made to reduce its duration.p

Negative 4367 pIn the past I have used message queues to handle spikes in demand. This system works fine, except for logging purposes. I write successfully processed messages to a database for reporting and logging. This makes me wonder why I dont just write the message into a database from the beginning, and have my worker roles poll the database, rather than the message queue.p  pIm guessing this is not the best design because as the database grows, polling a huge database just to look for one unchecked record to process will become very slow, whereas a message queue just gives me one if I ask for it instantaneously.p  pAm I missing something Are there other reasons to choose a message queue over polling a database I would love to offer users the ability to see what has yet to be processed floating in the queue but that operation takes much longer than running a query on the database, so it seems to be a tradeoff.p  pThanks for any input.p

Negative 4367 pI am developing a package  codemyvendormylibcode  that I plan to distribute using Composer, probably via Packagist.

When developing codemylibcode in isolation, the script codebinconsole.phpcode knows his own location relative to codevendorautoloader.phpcode, so he can include it easily. But once it is imported as a dependency into another project  codemyvendormymaincode, in this case  then there is only the codemymainvendorautoloader.phpcode script. In principle, the console script cannot know where he resides relative to that autoloader script.p  pDoes Composer provide some environment variable  accessible to the console script  that allows the script to locate the right codevendorautoloader.phpcode script p  pBTW I am aware of the a hrefhttpgetcomposer.orgdoc03cli.mdenvironmentvariablesComposer CLI environment variablea, so I imagine I could make it a requirement that the importing project  codemymaincode  define and export the var codeCOMPOSERVENDORDIRcode.

Negative 4367 pI am trying to write a program which can keep track of the number of chips each player has in poker. This is not a poker game, only a program which can keep the number of chips each player has. However, I want to be able to bet call fold etc and be able to automatically keep track. p  pMy question is, is there a way for adjusting the number of players without writing each permutations Currently, it can only keep track of 2 people.

Negative 4367 pI am processing PDF files and wish to convert characters to Unicode as far as possible. The MathematicalPI family of character sets appear to use their own symbol names e.g. H11001. By exploration I have constructed a table for MathematicalPIOne likep  precode    ltcharsgt         ltchar charnameH11001 codepoint160X2B codepoint43 unicodeNamePLUSgt         ltchar charnameH11002 codepoint160x2D codepoint45 unicodeNameMINUSgt         ltchar charnameH11003 codepoint160XD7 codepoint215 unicodeNameMULTIPLICATION SIGNgt           ltchar charnameH11005 codepoint160X3D codepoint61 unicodeNameEQUALSgt     ltchargt  codepre  pCan anyone point me to an existing translation table like this ideally for all MathematicalPI sets. [I dont want a graphical display of glyphs as that means each has to be looked up as a Unicode equivalent.]p  pAlso there seems to be a similar symbol resource where the charnames are of the form C223 for copyright. Any information on this will be appreciated.p  pUPDATE I need something well beyond user1808924s answer  I have already compiled by own partial translation table so its certainly possible to construct one. It is possible to download and display a list of glyphs in MathematicalPI may hundreds and to go through the Unicode spec making equivalences and for the majority I think there are clear equivalences. A satisfactory answer would either include a table with hundreds of equivalences or a defintive statement that this would violate Copyright of the font creator. p  pUPDATE Between minopret and Miguel it is certainly possible to construct a mapping. The MathPi sets are well defined  a few hundred  and shapecatcher makes it easy to find the best glyphs pictorially. The mapping wont be definitive i.e. with Adobes stamp but it will be worthwhile. And I suspect there will be cases where two different glyphs are essentially identical and so a visual mapping wont work  e.g. is an equilateral triangle INCREMENT or GREEK CAPITAL LETTER DELTA p  pI doubt that I personally will complete a full table  I dont know what some of the symbols mean. But I hope to produce a subset used in Scientific technical medical STM publishing.p  puser1808924 I notice you answered this on your first day on SO. Bounty questions are normally offered as in this case for difficult questions where there is a definitive answer but it is difficult to find. Its not normally useful to offer opinions or guesses unless you have expert knowledge of the area.p

Negative 4367 pSo I am really bad about not remembering to make unit tests for new classes that Ive created. I try my best to adhere to TDD, but sometimes I forget. Im good about running tests as it is just one button So is there a way to scan a namespace for all classes, and check to see if they are derived from a known class.p  pFor instance. I have a Contact class. I have 3 sub classes of Contact Shipping, Billing, Service I have a unit test for all 3. Lets say a month from now I decide to derive another class from Contact. Im super good about remember to run my unit tests, but in this case I would want it to fail just 1 test to remind me to write a unit test for my new contact class. Something like.p  precode    [TestMethod, TestCategoryContact]     public void TestAllContactsAccountedFor              foreachclass c in theNamespace                      bool subclassOfContact  c is  Contact             if subclassOfContact                              bool knownSubclass  c is CustomerShippingContact  c is CustomerBillingContact  c is CustomerServiceContact                 Assert.IsTrueknownSubclass                              codepre  pthis way if I forget to make a test it will fail this test, and then I account for it.

Negative 4367 pfor my thesis I need to draw some probabilistic control flow graphs. i.e. control flow graphs with probabilities depicted on the edges.p  pI found graphtool which seems quite useful, since it can use deepcopies of existing graphs and my graphs are quite similar.p  pSo my question is, if there is a possibility to draw edge properties or some strings onnext to the edges If its not possible or highly complicated, is there a tool which is better to use in this casep  pstrongEditstrong I need directed edges that can even create loops between 2 nodes and have different values. Is there a possibility for this too So I can see both values By now I can see the directed graph with a 2directional edge, but theres only one value on it.p  pSo e.g. in networkx in reference to Hooked it would look likep  precodeG  nx.MultiDiGraph G.addedge0,1 G.addedge1,0 labels  0,1foo, 1,0bar codepre  pSo that both foo and bar are visible and you can see which direction they are connected to.p  pBut as networkx renders it, I get 1 bidirectional edge with 1 of the labels.p

Negative 4367 pI am pretty new to Django and am trying to build a blog app for my website.  I have a model I have created to store blog posts that includes a text field for the post body, created and converted to HTML using TinyMCE via Grappelli.

So far, I am not having any luck getting the tags to render properly.

Negative 4367 pI have an issue which I hope I will solve by writing this question but if not I will post and see if anyone can help.p  pI am using a client library which is poorly written I feel to interact with a real time chat server that utilises COMET style longpolling over HTTP. Im having issues with cancelling the longpoll in certain situations and suspect I may need to add some concurrency handling code but am finding it hard to work out the best way to do this for the below reasons.p  pstrongThe subscribing codestrong that inits the long poll is implemented as a big loop with the followingp  precodedoLongPoll      whiletrue              IF channel field boolean unsubscribe  TRUE, if so BREAK         perform GET request and store channel HTTPClient used for this call         remove HTTPClient used for this call         IF channel field boolean unsubscribe  true, if so BREAK         IF connection problem sleep1500 then CONTINUE         post received data to listeners       codepre  pstrongThe unsubscribe callstrong that will called on another threadp  precodeunsubscribe      set channel field boolean unsubscribe  FALSE     get channel HTTPClient and shutdown  codepre  pI have isolated the problem case where the operations are interleaving. To me this seems a result of the code being multithreaded and the client code not being thread safe. Also poor management and nonreuse of the codehttpClientcode is not helping.p  pOne of the issues Im having is below where the unsubscribe call does not stop the next getRequest from taking place.p  precodeTHREAD 1 polling                      THREAD 2                                  do unsubscribe check pass                                         unsubscribe called                                         set unsubscribe  true                                         check if httpClient saved none perform getRequest save HttpClient first codepre  pI would like to know what people think the best approach to this problem would be time is also limited so I cant rewrite too much of the codep  pTo fix this i would thought i could use a strongsyncronisation blockstrong from the first unsubscribe check on thread 1 up to the point the codehttpClientcode is saved just before the actual get request is performed and syncronise the unsubscribe method using the same lock. This is not practical at the moment as the first sync block mentioned would start in one method call and finish further down the method call chain due to how the lib is written  which feels very wrong so some refactoring would be needed.p  pOR I could just create a strongsingle codehttpClientcode per channelstrong rather than per request and then it could always be shutdown and I could potentially ignore the syncronisation i think.p  pOR as suggested below I could use stronginterruptsstrong for the same purposep  pAny suggestions would be welcome  I will edit if I have any progressp  pThanks p

Well thats a lie i never payed attation if it is so or not, because it simply worked.li ul  pp  precodeclass MageShellCompiler extends MageShellAbstract  const OUTPUT  false const DEL  t const BR  rn const FILEPATH  ..varexport const FILENAME  tdtaCash  protected orders  array protected csvoutput   protected headers  array     dtTag gt false,  Bestelldatum     fiCBox gt 94,     fiCashier gt onlineshop,     fiCurrency gt arrayVisa, MC, Amex, DC, JCB, Direct,  Zahlungsart     dtRev gt false   Bruttoumsatz an diesem Tag mit dieser Zahlungsart    see headers for details protected function addOrderToRowsorder, rows      orderdata  ordergtgetOrigData     type  ordergtgetPaymentgtgetAdditionalInformationCCBRAND      switch type          case VISA             type  Visa             break         case MasterCard             type  MC             break         case American Express             type  Amex             break         case Diners Club             type  DC             break         case JCB             type  JCB             break         default             brand  ordergtgetPaymentgtgetAdditionalInformationBRAND             if brand  DirectEbankingAT                  type  Direct                          break           if emptyrows[type]          row  thisgtheaders         row[dtRev]  0      else         row  rows[type]      row[dtTag]        dateYmd, strtotimeorderdata[createdat]     row[dtTag]  thisgtformatDateorderdata[createdat], exportdate, true     row[fiCurrency]  type     row[dtRev]  orderdata[grandtotal]      rows[type]  row      return rows   protected function msg      if selfOUTPUT         print msg . n      Get Orders instance     return MageSalesModelOrder   protected function getOrdersday  1      timeZoneOffset  MagegetModelcoredategtgetGmtOffset     yesterday  dateYmd, strtotimeday day .  000000     yesterday  dateYmd His, strtotimeyesterday  timeZoneOffset     day     today  dateYmd, strtotimeday day .  000000     today  dateYmd His, strtotimetoday  timeZoneOffset     if thisgtorders         thisgtorders  MagegetResourceModelsalesordercollection                 gtaddAttributeToSelect                  note uncommented to remove daily filter                 gtaddAttributeToFiltercreatedat, arrayfrom gt yesterday, to gt today                 gtaddAttributeToFilterstatus, arraynin gt arrayholded, canceled, pendingpayment, pending     return thisgtorders   protected function addRowToOutputrow      if issetrow[dtRev]         row[dtRev]  numberformatrow[dtRev], 2     thisgtcsvoutput .  . implode . selfDEL . , row .  . selfBR   protected function addCsvHeader      thisgtaddRowToOutputarraykeysthisgtheaders      Run script     public function run      if thisgtgetArgexport          day  isnumericthisgtgetArgday  thisgtgetArgday  1         file  selfFILEPATH . selfFILENAME . .csv         thisgtorders to export  . countthisgtgetOrdersday          add header if file is empty         if strlentrimfilegetcontentsdirnameFILE .  . file             thisgtaddCsvHeader         rows  array         foreach thisgtgetOrdersday as order             rows  thisgtaddOrderToRowsorder, rows         while row  arrayshiftrows             thisgtaddRowToOutputrow         fileputcontentsdirnameFILE .  . file, thisgtcsvoutput, FILEAPPEND         thisgtthisgtcsvoutput      else          echo thisgtusageHelp           Retrieve Usage Help Message     public function usageHelp      return ltltltUSAGE     Usage  php f exporttdtaCash.php  [options]     export  ...

Negative 4367 pMaybe an odd question  p  pI have designed a very simple slideshow. Part of the slideshow includes some text which appears when you hover over the slideshow div. When you mouseout of the slideshow div, this text should disappear  and it does on the slide which is currently displayed. But upon rotation, one finds that the slides which were previously hidden the text is still showing presumably because one cannot hide an element whose parent is already hidden.

Negative 4367 pI have a design question that I am hoping someone can chime in with some words of wisdom.  I have two applications lets call them parent and children.  Each parent and child have their own db instance I really want to isolate the data.  There is one parent running in Tomcat.  The children will run in separate Tomcat instances multiple children per container, with hopefully many instances of Tomcat.  The number of children applications are dynamic  when a customer signs up, then a new deployment is autodropped into an available Tomcat instance, and a new db schema is created.  When children users successfully log in, it will authenticate against the parent, who will return a User object and the database connection parameters.p  pI definitely want to have the parent and children in separate containers.  I am not sure I need a dedicated db per child, but it seems more secure. My primary concern is performance and security. My dilemma is that passing encrypted db connections parameters doesnt feel right.  p  pCan anyone offer a good design or perhaps point me to documentation that explains some solutions  p

Negative 4367 pI am mapping multiple physically noncontiguous memory buffers to a single linear user space address.  I use vminsertpage and getpage.  I need to use getpage on all allocated pages because only the very first page of a given buffer has a ref count  0 and vminsertpage needs ref count to be  0. Supposedly according to some post on the Net I have to free the pages for which I increment ref count by calling getpage if no longer needed.  However, Im not quite sure how to free the pages. Do I need to keep track of each page struct returned by getpage and then call a corresponding API to free the pages during unmapping  It does not look like OS will do it for me automatically.  That is, after user process exists, ref counts on the pages stay unchanged and get incremented again on next mmap from user space.p  pMy pseudo code is like this     pre     allocate multiple phys noncontiguous memory buffers using calls to pciallocconsistent     for all 4K chunks in all buffers allocated above          create a page struct using virttopagephyschunkaddr           this is needed because only the very first page of a phys buffer           will have ref count  0 which is needed by vminsertpage          increment page ref count by calling getpage          place the page in vma using vminsertpage     pre Thanks for any suggestionspointers.

Negative 4367 pI have a MS Access 2010 database with two tables one for Contracts and the other for Projects. Relation is 1 Contract to many projects. I have a MainForm Single that pulls up the contract with a subform that shows related projects located in Detail section of MainForm . I WAS able to search through each record of the MainForm using the record navigator at the bottom. As the Contract record changed on the MainForm the subForm was populated with the projects for next Contract record. Estimated number of records Contracts was about 65p  pToday I added two new fields both in the Contracts table and Projects table to capture the date last modified LastModDate amp LastModTime. Everthing is populating as expected except now the search record bar for the MainForm is showing 227 records which is the total number of project records. The search bar for the the SubForm displays the number of projects for that Contract record.p  pLooking for advice on pulling the search next record back to the contract level versus the project level.p

Negative 4367 pI recently attended a coding interview and I was asked a question which I didnt know the answer to.

Maybe you want to define a global variant in these function to record the running function, but that is not allowed.p  pOk Thats all about the question I met in a coding interview.  p

Negative 4367 pIm writing an application which interfaces with a number of registers that are defined in VHDL. The registers are 32bits wide and allocated into groups. Im provided with the groups base address and with 32bit offsets for each member of the group. Here is an example of one group, a register within the group, and the registers structure.p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comxfoa6.png altGroup 1  base addr  offset  dataport p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comtEaWh.png altdataport  altu32 data0  12  altu32 data1  1  ....p  pCurrently IO is handled using the following bit field structure,p  precodetypedef struct     uint32t   data0  12    uint32t   data1  1    ... volatile dataport codepre  pand modifying the fields using a pointer to the addresses,p  precodedataport const pdata  dataport 0xc006380 codepre  pWhile this might work on this platform, with the current compiler, Im concerned about portability. I was wondering if there is a better method for handling the interface to hardware when forced to use these unconventional data types p  pOne alternative I can think of is to create another layer between the hardware and the register structures, a volatile unsigned int pointer, and to use the bitfield structure in the application layer. The problem is, the data will still have to be copied from the bitfields, which may be aligned differently on another platform, to the int, which may be another topic, altogether.p  pEditbr I think what Im really looking for is a way to eliminate the use of bitfields. Mapping a struct with bitfield members to hardware really seems to be a bad approach. So, to eliminate that Ill use one of the following instead as a pointer to the volatile memory address,p  precodedefine PeripheralBase uint32t volatile BASE codepre  por p  precodeuint32t volatile const peripheralbase   uint32t  BASE codepre  pHopefully, once I get to this point everything will be well aligned within the 32bits. One method I was thinking of for doing this was to create the same dataport structure, but remove the bit packing, and then right a function specifically for each register to shift the bits into an unsigned int, which could then be passed to the register using the volatile pointer.p  pSomething like,p  precodestatic inline uint32t structtouintdataport data     return datagtdata0          uint32tdatagtdata1 ltlt 12          uint32tdatagtdata2 ltlt 13          .....  codepre  pIm not sure if the syntax is right, but the idea is to shift the values in without having to worry about the compiler or platform. Does this make since Are there portability issues with this approachp

Negative 4367 pI am creating a tool that will allow an admin to open up any table in a database and edit any row or field.  Basically, what I do is fill a DataTable with codeselect  from tablenamecode and then bind that to the GridView.  With codeAutoGenerateColumnstruecode, all of the tables columns show up and the edit controls even populate when I click the Edit button.p  pMy next step is to actually perform the update.  Heres what I need to accomplish thisp  ul liTable nameli liList of columns that is not reliant on ordinal positioningli liList of values that coorespond to each cells columnli ul  pI have the table name, but I am having trouble bringing everything together for the update script.  There is a codeNewValuescode property in the codeGridViewUpdateEventArgscode class and I can iterate through them ordinally, but, like I said, I dont want to rely on ordinal positions in the event that the value order falls out of sync with the column order.  If there were a keyvalue pair that contained a DataField name like what youd see with a BoundField column and its new value, I could easily generate the update script.  I also attempted to iterate through the GridViews columns, but it always returns 0 since there are no actual columns declared in the GridView markup.p  pMy only other option would appear to be to create something entirely from scratch, but the GridView already has transactional and paging functionality, so Id rather not reinvent wheels if I dont have to.p

I overwrote a column in ALL instead of just one record and after hours of googling I did not find a common way to rollback this stupid transaction ended up fixing 76 rows manually.p  pI was working on the live environment on heroku and just wanted to fix one entry. There must be a way to rollback a transaction in the database postgres if you did stupid things  not by using pgbackup.p  pWould be great if you can share some best pratices with me or give me a good reading to start.

Once finished processing it I want to go on with the next one coming in.p  pFor this I tried two different approachesp  ol lipAdd two buffers via Camera.addCallbackBuffer and have a Thread working on one of them while the PreviewCallback is instantly readding the currently unused buffer whenever a frame is incoming.pli lipUse setOneShotPreviewCallback, process the frame in the callback method and setOneShotPreviewCallback again.pli ol  pProcessing of one frame takes around 500ms.p  pWith both approaches I get two issuesp  ol liThe preview framerate on TextureView decreases a lotli liMain Issue In most of the cases I get some kind of dead lock during recording or at the end of the recording.li ol  pThats what I do using the setOneShotPreviewCallbackapproachp  precodeMediaRecorder mr  new MediaRecorder prepare Recorder...  mr.start cam.setOneShotPreviewCallbackmyCallbackObject codepre  pAnd later, from another Thread I stop recordingp  precodemr.stop cam.setPreviewCallbacknull ... codepre  pThats what the callback method doesp  precodedo something with the data buffer cam.setOneShotPreviewCallbackthis codepre  pIn most cases my code gets stuck atp  precodemr.stop codepre  pbut sometimes also atp  precodecam.setOneShotPreviewCallbackthis codepre  pinside the callback.p  pThanks a lot in advance for any advicep

Negative 4367 pI wrote a code on windows, using the function codegetchcode from codestdiocode. The thing is I have to use an input function that does not require pressing enter.p  pMy code compiles and works perfectly on windows.

The problem is that according to the assignment, I can not use other includes but codestdio.hcode and same goes for adding a flag, so I can not use codecurses.hcode to solve this.p  pI also can not use codetermios.hcode and so on, we have not learned it. How can I solve this Are there any other optionsp  pThanksp

Negative 4367 pI have a program that does some kind of calculation on an external computer. That program sends information about its progress which is then shown in a GUI. It roughly works like thisp  precodepublic void receiveDatafinal int step, final double errorRate      Platform.runLaternew Runnable              Override         public void run                      stepLabel.setTextstep             errorLabel.setTexterrorRate                codepre  pBy the system output on the external computer, I can see that the program performs its calculation very fast. The GUI on the other hand shows program not fast enough. When the calculation is done, I can still see the values changing because the queue at Platform.runLater still contains runnables with updates.p  pHow can I fasten the changesp  pWhat also would be a good soluation is that if the GUI does not show every single change in values if its not fast enough. I.e., if there is a Runnable in queue at Platform.runLater for step 200, but receiveData receives a value for 201, the value for 200 doesnt need to be shown because it already is obsolete.p

Negative 4367 pIm making my first game in C, and it seems that I have a memory leak.p  pStack Exchange wont let me post pictures, but I opened the task manager to the Memory tab, and the memory graph slowly increases while my game is open, and then decreases abruptly when the game is closed. p  pRight now, my game just includes a ball that can move around and shoot bullets, and displays text using SDLttf to show how much ammo is left, which gun is selected, and which wave I am on, which is a static variable from the Main class. However, strangely enough, without even shooting any bullets or pressing any buttons, this memory leak still occurs. Ive been making sure I dont have any memory leaks since I started the game, and up until recently there havent been any. This means that my memory leak is most likely caused by the text being displayed or accessing the static variable, because I dont know exactly how forward declarations work I dont think.p  pSince the memory leak happens without pressing any buttons in the game, I figured that it must be triggered in the game loop, so I checked all the function calls and everything in the game loop, which leads me to think that it must be from something in the Player class, specifically in the Update or renderHUD.p  pHeres the code from the Player and Main class, I included the headers to make sure that my forward declarations were ok and so you see which pointers Im using. I didnt include the game loop because all of the function calls that could potentially cause a memory leak are included already.

Negative 4367 pWhen I tried to use a custom extension element with Saxon, I got an error saying codeXTDEunknown extension instructioncode in my XSL file. I asked this on Saxon mailing list, but havent yet received a response, so I decided to ask here. In order to be helpful, here is the whole content from the mailing list  p  blockquote   pstrongfrom skystrongbr   I just start using Saxon. After go through some documentations, I still found it hard to write my own custom extension instruction. I have read writing XSLT extension instructions, and the example provided in the package net.sf.saxon.option.sql. But Im still a little confusing the document says,p      blockquote     pA subclass of SimpleExpression should implement the methods getImplementationMethod and getExpressionType, and depending on the value returned by getImplementationMethod, should implement one of the methods evaluateItem, iterate, or process.p   blockquote      pHowever, there is only call method implemented in the sql example. Im new to XMLXSLT, hence find it hard to understand how to write my own extension elements.   Is there a tutorial of some kind which explains writing extension elements in more detailI have Google but found no luck, the best I can find is with older Saxon version that has different implementation. Or maybe I should go through some other XMLXSLT intermediate first   Thanks in advancep blockquote  hr  blockquote   pstrongfrom Michael Kaystrongbr   Youre right, implementing extension instructions is not easy. Thats partly because the APIs are quite complex, partly because the documentation is poor, and partly because the code that would help you understand it is not open source. The underlying reason for this is that not many people have attempted to do this, so there has been little feedback that would lead to improvement over the years.p      pI would encourage you to ask yourself seriously whether this is something you really want to do badly enough to cope with the difficulties.br   The documentation extract you cite appears to be out of date.

I have a table view with cells like Instagram with images downloaded from the server. My problem is when I scroll the table view, its not smooth and it blinks. p  pTo construct the table view, I do the followingp  pthe header views and the cells are subclassed. I download all the images async and cache them afterwards about 25Ko each in the tmp folder of my app.  each image downloaded has the same frame as the UIImageView in which it should be placed. I tried to save the images in png and jpeg format, but the problem remains.p  pI did another test where instead of putting the downloaded images inside the cells, I put an image inside my app with any scaling. In that case, the table view scrolls smoothly. p  pSo I suspect maybe the problem is with the way I cache the images and get them from the cache.

Negative 4367 pIm building a messaging application that needs to receive messages from the web. Originally I was going to run this application as a Windows service and have a web wrapper using ASP.NET MVC that could be accessed by clients to send messages to the application. But I am now learning about the Web API which is much better suited for this task but the question remains whether it makes more sense to include the base application as part of the Web API selfhost framework or if I should leave it as a Windows service and wrap a Web API application around it. p  pIs there really a difference Was the Web API designed to combine the concept of a service layer and a web interface into a single framework Im not sure how scalablerobust a selfhosted application can be compared to a Windows service. Will the Web API selfhost method limit me in any way that the service method wont What about a Web API application hosted inside IIS such that my base application will be running inside IIS Im not sure of the specifics of performance that I need such as memory or CPU at this point so would it be easier to start with IIS and then if needed, convert it into a selfhostedwindows service if the need be I hope these questions make sense although Im not sure if they do.p  pIm new to Web API so Im just trying to wrap my head around these concepts. p

Negative 4367 pI have a ViewController on which the user can tap a button and start a relatively large download around 200mb. I have all the correct NSUrlSession delegates in place, and as long the user does not navigate away from the ViewController, a UIProgressView will update perfectly and everything downloads just fine. My problem is that while the file is downloading, I want the user to be able to go to other ViewControllers, but still be able to come back and check the progress of the download.p  pHowever, after navigating to a different ViewController and coming back, the delegate methods are not firing for the download task. I can tell with NSLog that the file is still downloading, but the UIProgressView no longer updates because the delegate methods arent being called. How, when coming back to the page can I grab the currently running download task and fire its delegate methods in order to correctly update the progress viewp  pWhen I navigate to the Download File page, I set up the NSUrlSession.p  precode voidviewDidLoad      [super viewDidLoad]       Create a session with the custom configuration     self.session  [self backgroundSession]    NSURLSession backgroundSession      static NSURLSession session  nil     static dispatchoncet onceToken     dispatchonceamponceToken,                                   Session Configuration                   NSURLSessionConfiguration sessionConfiguration  [NSURLSessionConfiguration backgroundSessionConfigurationcom.NSUrlSession.app]                     Initialize Session                   session  [NSURLSession sessionWithConfigurationsessionConfiguration                                                           delegateself                                                      delegateQueuenil]                     return session  codepre  pThen I have a button that creates the download task and starts downloading.p  precode IBActiondownloadMovieidsender      [UIApplication sharedApplication].networkActivityIndicatorVisible  YES      NSURLRequest request  [NSURLRequest requestWithURL[NSURL URLWithStringLARGEMOVIE]]      NSURLSessionDownloadTask task  [self.session downloadTaskWithRequestrequest]      [task resume]  codepre  pHere is the delegate method that updates the UIProgressViewp  precode voidURLSessionNSURLSession session downloadTaskNSURLSessionDownloadTask downloadTask didWriteDataint64tbytesWritten totalBytesWrittenint64ttotalBytesWritten totalBytesExpectedToWriteint64ttotalBytesExpectedToWrite      double progress  double totalBytesWritten1024  double totalBytesExpectedToWrite1024     dispatchasyncdispatchgetmainqueue,                                            [self.progressView setProgressprogress animatedNO]                        NSLogf, progress                      codepre  pLike I said, as long as the user doesnt navigate to a different view controller everything downloads perfectly and the UIProgressView updates correctly. But, if the user leaves and comes back, the the newly instantiated view controller isnt the same as the original one that was assigned as the delegate to the session, so the delegate method isnt firing and its not updating the UIProgressView, even though the file is still downloading in the background as you can tell from the NSLog updates.p

Negative 4367 pSo Im working on an assignment in LC3 assembly language, and Im having an issue.

Negative 4367 pI have been trying to solve this problem for 9 hours straight, but nothing seems to work. I am building an app that captures values for all the available sensors in an Android phone over a certain time period, and stores these values in a remote database. Two things should be kept in mind p  ol lipEach sensor has its own capture frequency i.e. accelerometer each 10 seconds, gyroscope each 5 seconds, proximity each 60 seconds etc....pli lipThis process doesnt go indefinitely, so there is a variable called duration, that specifies the total time spent capturing values. For example, if emacctimeem  10 and emdurationem  60, then well end up with 7 values captured at the 0s, 10s, 20s, 30s, 40s, 50s and 60s marks.pli ol  pOK now for the codep  precodepublic void onSensorChangedSensorEvent event       Sensor s  event.sensor      if s.getType  Sensor.TYPEACCELEROMETER                 acc1  event.values[0]           acc2  event.values[1]           acc3  event.values[2]           accm  float Math.sqrtacc1  acc1  acc2  acc2  acc3  acc3        codepre  pIn the code above, the values are stored into their respective variables successfully.

Negative 4367 pI am building a RESTful API for retrieving and storing comments in threads. p  pA comment thread is identified by an arbitrary URI  usually this is the URL of the web page where the comment thread is related to.

Negative 4367 pAs per theory following properties are to define number of mapred task slots at data node. codemapred.tasktracker.map.tasks.maximum  mapred.map.taskscode. p  pAlso, number of mapper objects is decided by the number of input splits in the MapReduce job. We implement mapred function and framework creates objects and sends them closest to data blocks.p  pSo what is the difference between map task slots and mapper objects created by framework. p  pLets say i am storing 2TB file across 5 data nodes, each node having 400Mb. If i define codedfs.block.size 100Mbcode then each node will hold 400100  4 data blocks. Here, out of 4 data blocks we can ideally have 4 input splits and in turn 4 mapper objects per node. And at the same time if i define codemapred.tasktracker.map.tasks.maximum  2code amp codemapred.map.tasks2code, then what conclusion can i make out of it. Can i say 4 mapper objects are to be shared among 2 map task slots. I might be going in a wrong direction, any clarification would be helpful.p

The problem is with SphinxSearchDbAdapterAdapter because it uses a factory to create a database adapter for running SphinxQL services.

Negative 4367 pSo I have created a very basic showoff type of bot, it runs off of the Skype API and requires Skype to be running in order for it to work properly. I have tested the bot by hosting it off of my own computer no problem, the issue is that I dont want to have my computer running 247. Thats why I looked at OVH.com for hosting. I would like to get a small 3 VPS and host the bot off of that. I have tried on my other servers with them CentosDebian to get Skype running but it seems to be quite the struggle. So in end I need something OSProgramWhatever to get this bot hosted on an OVH vps using one of their provided operating systems.p

Negative 4367 pI cant find anything in the docs that explain the details of this method.

Negative 4367 pcodeHandlercode in Android uses a codeMessageQueuecode to access the stored messages.

This creates a problem that the handler is able to handle strongonly onestrong message at a time.

Negative 4367 pSo I have a question about creating a class object and scope. My program needs to do 3 different things depending on if its called by .Bank, .Bank [number], and . Bank [number] [string]. I have a Bank class that has 3 contructors that correspond to how the program is started Bank, Bankint num, and Bankint num, string str. The Bank is just an array of Customer objects, the default constructor sets a default length of the array, the second constructor lets the user set the length of the array, and the last lets the user set the length and a text file name to populate the arrayit uses the info to create a new Customer, then adds the Customer to the array. Can I do this in the main p  precodeint mainint argc, char argv   string progNameargv[0]   int numCustomers   string fileName   ifargc  1       Bank bank      get number of customers argument   ifargc gt 1       istringstream bufargv[1]       buf gtgt numCustomers       Bank banknumCustomers      get file name argument   ifargc gt 2       istringstream bufargv[1]       buf gtgt numCustomers       fileName  argv[2]       Bank banknumCustomers, fileName     more stuff below codepre  pand then later on in main call bank.function Or does the bank only exist in the if statement scope I know with a variable it wouldnt exist outside the if statement, but is it different when you create a class inside an if statementp

Negative 4367 pCan anyone tell me the best way of calculating the end date of a recurring event from the number of occurrences and the pattern in which the event occurs.p  pFor example I have an event which has start date as 10072014 Tuesday and occurs every week on Tuesday. This event will end after 10 occurrences say. So, the my method should return me the end date as  12092014p  pThe method should also consider more complex situations like suppose if the event occurs yearly on first Monday of October and has total 10 occurrences.p

Negative 4367 pMy gesture recognizers stopped working when I switched to programmatically creating a UIView rather than using a xib. bQuestion how can I programmatically implement gesture recognition using just a custom view controller and no custom UIView or is this not possiblebp  pI know some think this is bad practice, but thats not my question. Id rather not have to move the gesturerelated functions to a UIView subclass because then Ill just be setting up a delegate protocol of some kind for the view to tell the view controller about the gesture, which seems quite roundabout when Im happy having it all in the view controller.

Negative 4367 pJust to begin I know there are a couple similarlytitled questions on here, but none are explained quite this way nor is the problem scope the same.p  pI want to add nested dictionary entries dynamically.p  pThe use case is thus I have a python script that is monitoring the network. A dictionary is created for each observed IP protocol tcp, udp, icmp that is observed. Then a subdictionary is created with a key that is the destination port if one exists for each of these IP protocols 80, 443, etc. note it doesnt matter whether it sees the server port as the source or destination, but normally servers are the destination so I picked HTTP and HTTPS as examples. For each of these destination ports a key is created corresponding to the server IP e.g., the IP for www.google.com. And then another dictionary with the timestamp the session was first observed as the key and the datavalue for the key being the clients IP.p  pHowever, I want need this to be populated as time goes on since I wont have the data before execution nor at initialization.p  pThe output would look something akin top  precode  icmp       echorequest           ltipofwww.google.comgt                lttimestampgt  ltsomeclientipgt                echoreply           ltipofwww.google.comgt                lttimestampgt  ltsomeclientipgt                 tcp            80           ltipofwww.google.comgt                lttimestampgt  ltsomeclientipgt                lttimestampgt  ltsomeclientipgt                443           ltipofencrypted.google.comgt                lttimestampgt  ltsomeclientipgt                lttimestampgt  ltsomeclientipgt                lttimestampgt  ltsomeclientipgt                lttimestampgt  ltsomeclientipgt               codepre  pThanksp

Negative 4367 pI am developing a RCP program in Java, which calls some APIs from a DLL file via JNIJava Native Interface. The dll file is also developed by myself. p  pAn API we call it A is used for getting some data and it can take a long time. So I developed another API called B here to cancel the processing of A and return the already calculated data e.g. maybe 50 of expected data back to my RCP. In my RCP, I have 2 threads, one as a background thread waiting for the result from A, the other provide a dialog with a cancel button to allow user cancel it. When cancel button is pressed, B is called. In this way, B could cancel the busy A. Now the problem comes. When I click the cancel button , A returns no data. But it works if I run two RCPs in parallel and use one RCP to cancel the other.p  pIt seems that I have some conflicts when use 2 threads in the same process to access JNI while works well with separated processes. p  pI want to know what really happens here How is JNI shared by several threadsprocesses How  to avoid getting stuck in DLLp  pThank you very muchp

Negative 4367 pI have a gridview with thumbnails from sdcard. I use an asynctask to lazy load images. It works perfect when i scroll slowly however when I scroll too fast, different images loading on same grid item multiple times and it takes 6 7 second to finally load the correct image. I tried to check if the position of the view is visible by using getFirstVisiblePosition and getLastVisiblePosition, and this time some of the images never loads. p

Negative 4367 pI Have a simple site set up with a header, navbar and content. When the page reaches the navbar, the position becomes fixed so the navbar sits at the top of the page  at this point, the navbar height also gets a bit smaller as I like this effect  I have done this by adding separate classes, fixed and thinner to the navbar.p  pMost people are aware of the issue that occurs when you add positionfixed to an inline element in that it makes the content suddenly jump upwards. To counteract this i have added a div called stopthejump which is hidden until the navbar becomes fixed, at which point it is displayed in its place. All of this runs smoothly on the way down, but as you scroll back up you get a jump due to the fact that the navbar is now thinner.p  pIm pulling my hair out over this one, how can I eliminate this jump that occurs on the way back up.p  pHere is a JSFiddle clearly showing my issue a hrefhttpjsfiddle.netgnac14qa relnofollowhttpjsfiddle.netgnac14qaap  pMy jQuery code is as followsp  precodewindow.scrollfunction       var Scroll  window.scrollTop var ScrollFXfullHeight  .headerwrapper.height  if Scroll  ScrollFXfullHeight   navigation.addClassfixed .stopthejump.cssdisplay,block   else if Scroll gt ScrollFXfullHeight  ifnavigation.hasClassfixed      .stopthejump.cssdisplay,block     navigation.addClassfixed  navigation.addClassthinner   else  navigation.removeClassthinner fixed .stopthejump.removeClassthinner .stopthejump.cssdisplay,none   codepre  pAny help would be much appreciated.p

Negative 4367 pAs part of implementing a UICollisionBehaviour I set up boundaries for the screen edge.

Negative 4367 pI have a android app like a browser. When it opens a webpage and there is a video tag in the webpage, the app will inject some codeJavaScriptcode to get the video src and play it full screen in a android activitythe playing activity is another activity, I just get the video URL from webpage, and the video is not played in the webpage.brbr But when the video is playing which means the webpage is in background state, if the codeJavaScriptcode in the page want to set another source to the video tag, the codejscode is blocked. The codejscode will continue to run until exiting the play which means the webpage is foreground.brbr This happens on Android 4.4, but not android 4.3 4.2 4.1 or 4.0.

Negative 4367 pSo I am trying to centralize the data service that passes all of the information back and forth between my application and the backend services.p  pMy application does not autobootstrap using ngappmyApp, instead it loads the few modules it needs to load an external config file, and use that to get the initial data from the server before bootstrapping the application.  Once the application gets bootstrapped, the feeds are assigned to the main controllers scope via codescope[feedName]  feedDatacode.  Because the feeds may vary, Ive done this to ensure that the data is available to all scopes at all times.p  pSince I need to be able to use resource efficiently in this prebootstrapped scenario, I wrote a small function to get data called codegetDataFromurl, data, methodcode.p  pIt looks like this p  precodegetDataFrom  functionurl, data, method      Create the resource object to get the data using the supplied parameters         var getData  resourceurl, .extenddata, callback JSONCALLBACK, query method method       Return the promise immediately         return getData.query.promise  codepre  pIt works perfectly in this scenario.  Now, before I bootstrap my application, I assign a few constants, and this function is one of themp  pcodeapp.constantgetDataFrom, getDataFromcodep  pThen whenever a module needs to sendreceive data it is included as a dependencyp  pcode.controllermyController, function scope, rootScope, location, sanitize, getDataFromcodep  pFrom here I can simply make a call like thisp  pcodegetDataFrommyUrl, myDataequalsThis, JSON.thenresultdo stuffcodep  pThe problem I am having happens inside the codethencode part of this scenario.  If I do anything involving the scope, such as codelocation.pathnewpathcode or codescope.value  newValuecode, none of this will happen unless I manually run codescope.applycode.  Since this is supposed to be an easy way of handling data, this clearly wont cut it.p  pCan somebody please explain to me why my codethencode is missing the bus of the codescope.applycode that gets run automaticallyp  pHow this is getting calledp  precodegetDataFrom         scope.app.services.myService,          myData input.val         , JSON .thenfunctionresult     if result.data ampamp result.data.length gt 0         scope.results  result.data         list.show       codepre

As it was expected, a folderaction.portal.jsp was created containing the original file.p  pHowever, Ive noticed something strange. After stopping Tomcat both folderaction.jsp and folderaction.portal.jsp are deletedthis is not happening for the other files that come from the hook, and when it is up again a really strange thing happens. The folderaction.portal.jsp contains the changed file and the folderaction.jsp is the original file.p  pHas anyone met something similar ever Any help would be appreciated. p
Negative 4367 pI have an html source file which I use to edit and test with an html editor. For my purposes I would like to include this file in my C11 source code by instantiating a codestdstringcode containing the html file content as it is.p  pFor now, I am using the following way, which is not ideal as it require an unwanted modification to the html source code, as shown belowp  precodestdstring myhtml   include my.html  codepre  pwhere codemy.htmlcode contains something likep  precodeR ltDOCTYPE htmlgt lthtmlgt lthtmlgt  codepre  pNote the codeRcode and codecode tokens. They are there for the only purpose of allowing the C11 codestdstringcode to be instantiated by the compiler.p  pOf course, those tokens make my html source code nonhtml compliant. Id like to have them removed from the html source, yet be able to instantiate the string in some other way.p  pDo you know any solution I prefer standard solutions to preprocessor tricks. However, a preprocessor help is okay in the only case the are no standard solutions.p
Negative 4367 pI am working on a video streaming application in C, and I have questions about serialization of the packets. I know there are a number of serialization frameworks out there from Google Protocol Buffers, Apache Thrift, Cereal, etc. I am correct in thinking that the packets will need to be serialized, rightp  pSince any little bit of overhead can cause latency, is it worthwhile to use an existing framework to do the serialization  p  pWould it even be worth my time to try and roll my own or just stick to the frameworks  p  pI know most of the frameworks will take into account bigendian and littleendian which is nice.p  pFrom the research I have done, I was leaning towards trying to use Google Protocol Buffers. Is this a good serialization library for a streaming application  p  pAre there any other suggestionsp  pI appreciate the advice and suggestions.p

Negative 4367 pI am getting a broken pipe exception when the server is left running for a long time without any http requests.

Negative 4367 pHI I am just starting out trying to use Highcharts to display weather data from a mysql database. The database is running and I can run basic queries to extract data.

Negative 4367 pIve been assigned the task of developing a simple text analyzer, that receives lines as input and counts word frequency, to then print the words ordered by number of occurence, and, within the same frequencies, alphabetically. I wanted to make it as time and space efficient as possible, and am trying to figure out what data structure would be the best, allied to which sorting algorithm.p  pFor now, I had a version of quicksort in mind, but that would mean that my words would have to be already placed in an array, after being counted. A static array would right away make time complexity On for the search operations while processing the input  so I was thinking of taking advantage of another structure such as a balanced binary tree to do the processing, then turning it into an array.p  pAm I thinking correctly, or would turning a tree into an array harm my efficiency Any suggestionp  pThank youp

Negative 4367 pLet me start by saying I have scoured the internet all day looking for a solution, and Im just stumped. I managed to find enough code snippets to put together an almost working version of what I need  but to be completely honest Im just lost when it comes to how to make it work.p  pHeres what Im trying to dop  pIm trying to make a php function that will take 2 or maybe 3 colors, and apply them as a smooth gradient to a text string. strongI need the function to output the actual HTML code for the gradientstrong. How I envision it working is it will take the message string and split it into the individual characters, and then color each character in such a way that when its displayed with the html output, it will look like a smooth fade from one color to the next.  Right now Im testing the function with 2 colors that Ive just defined inside it, FF0000 and 0000FF.  I cant seem to get it to color the entire string. It seems to grab the first letter, and do part of the transition, and then just stop. p  pHeres a screenshot of what Im trying to make it look like img srchttpi.stack.imgur.comKaM7M.jpg altenter image description herep  pHeres a screenshot of what mine comes out looking like including the html output for explanation sake img srchttpi.stack.imgur.comvsfdQ.jpg altenter image description herep  pHeres the code that Im usingp  precodeltphp  function html2rgbcolor      if color[0]           color  substrcolor, 1      if strlencolor  6         listr, g, b  arraycolor[0].color[1],                                  color[2].color[3],                                  color[4].color[5]     elseif strlencolor  3         listr, g, b  arraycolor[0].color[0], color[1].color[1], color[2].color[2]     else         return false      r  hexdecr g  hexdecg b  hexdecb      return arrayr, g, b  function rgb2htmlr, g1, b1      if isarrayr ampamp sizeofr  3         listr, g, b  r      r  intvalr g  intvalg     b  intvalb      r  dechexrlt00rgt255255r     g  dechexglt00ggt255255g     b  dechexblt00bgt255255b      color  strlenr lt 20.r     color . strleng lt 20.g     color . strlenb lt 20.b     return .color      echo lth1gtResultlth1gt     srccolor  html2rgbFF0000     dstcolor  html2rgb0000FF     printrdstcolor      fori0 ilt3 i         stepcolor[i]   dstcolor[i]  srccolor[i]   30.30      stepcolor array contains difference between adjacent color stripes      htmlout    html code container      forj0 jlt60 j           generate color stripe code          message  I am trying to make this text string fade from one color to another         counter  strlenmessage         array  strsplitmessage         mycount  0           ifmycount lt counter             line  ltbgtltfont color .rgb2htmlsrccolor.gt.array[mycount].ltfontgtltbgt         htmlout . line  save color stripe to display HTML code later         mycount  mycount  1                  echo line  output color stripe to browser          fori0 ilt1 i  incrementing each color component             srccolor[i]  stepcolor[i]       gt lth1gtHTML Codelth1gt ltpregtltphp  output HTML code replacing lt and gt with amplt and ampgt stuff  strtrhtmlout, arrayamp gt ampamp,                             lt gt amplt,                             gtgt ampgt echo stuff codepre  pIm fairly new to this sort of thing, so please dont be too brutal on me if my code is arsebackwards or poor.

Negative 4367 pIm finding an issue trying to navigate back using unwind segues. Having a navigation stack likep  pstrongArootstrong  strongBstrong  strongCstrongp  pAt a certain moment, my ViewController strongCstrong pushes a ViewController strongDstrong. strongDstrong makes a web request and notifies the result of it via an exposed RACSignal. strongCstrong is subscribed to that signal and performs an Unwind Segue after processing the signal which should navigate back to ViewController strongAstrong. Nothing happens after performing the Unwind Segue, no back navigation.p  pThe Unwind Segue is correctly defined in the Storyboard, the signal executes properly... Ive found that if I explicitly pop strongDstrong before performing the Unwind Segue, then it navigates properly to that ViewController strongAstrong.p  pIs it only possible to perform an unwind segue from a top in the navigation stack ViewController Is there any way to accomplish what I want to do Maybe the whole approach is wrong. I just want to navigate from D to A unwinding from C.p  pThe reason why strongDstrong cant navigate back itself is because this ViewController is reused throughout the app, and therefore is navigationagnostic  p  pThanksp  pPS If you need any piece of code to understand how everything is implemented, please let me know. But I think the explanation is clear enough anyway...p

Negative 4367 pWhat reasons could there be for boostpython not to be able to catch an exception thrown in an extension module written using its help and translate it to python Instead, the interpreter crashes with codeterminate called after throwing an instance of ltsomeexcpetionclassgtcode.p  pMy extension module is using some functions from emCGALem, to which it links dynamically, and which throws the exception. It also links dynamically to the boostpython shared library. Im on linux. Its written in codestdc11code and I prefer to compile with codeclangcode.p  pMy first thought was that this is a problem of throwing exceptions accross shared library boundaries. However, I did everything I could imagine to circumvent the problem, suggesting it has nothing to do with thisp  ul liThe exception translation properly works for other exceptions thrown from my codeli liI tried compiling both with clang 3.4 and gcc 4.8.2li liThe code throwing is a header from CGAL, in a failing assert macro which calls info a fail function in the CGAL shared library. However, redefining that macro such that it raises from within the extension module did not help, independent if the exception class was from CGAL or a stdexception or a boostexception child class. li ul  pAny thoughtsp

Negative 4367 pThe generic algorithm to deduce if a string contains all unique characters and that does not use any other data structures says to go through the string, iterating each letter against the entire string searching for a match.

Negative 4367 pI need to read a very large file 1.11gb into memory and process it in bytes. The only way for me to do this is to use an ArrayList I cant use a byte[] because then it will exceed the limit. There is no way to make the file smaller Im using it as a test to test how long my program processes data. I then need to drop an ArrayList back onto the hard drive as a file still 1.11gb Im not as worried about writing as I am reading. Also speed is of the essence so sub segmenting is to be avoided unless anyone out there has a quick way of doing so.p

It is initialised like so codefoo  FileProxysomefile.txtcode and I can then use it like sop  precodefoo.open foo.writesomething foo.close codepre  pI want to make this work as a context manager. The question is whether I should make it work like this where the context manager does more than just creating the object but actually calls the code.opencode method and code.closecode upon exit.p  precodewith FileProxysomefile.txt as f    f.writesomething codepre  por should I do something likep  precodewith FileProxysomefile.txt.open as f    f.writesomething codepre  pwhich is more symmetrical with the non context manager API. p  pI prefer the former myself but it looks different from the way regular files in Python work and Im wondering if theres some anti pattern that Im implementing here. p
Negative 4367 pI have created this PHP script, pulled together from other peoples snippets and for the most part it works. However, the live flights table has something weird going on and I cant seem to fix it and wondered if anyone here might be able to help.p  pThe issue is with the Pilot details. I have a piece of code which should, for each pilot pirep, identify their ID and then load their first and last name. This is exactly the same piece of code for the second table recent flights and that section works perfectly. For some reason, in the first table, things work fine when there is only one pilot flying. As soon as I get two pilots flying the table shows the pilot names to all be the same and its not necessarily the name of a pilot that is actually flying at the time.p  pI have pasted the tables below. The coding forms part of a virtual airline management system called PHPVMS and is based around PHP, Dataclasses and MySQL. You can see the page itself at a hrefhttpwww.virginatlanticvirtual.co.uk relnofollowwww.virginatlanticvirtual.co.ukap  pMy current thinking is that because the first and second flight tables are using the same piece of code, this might be causing the conflict but Im not technical enough to work out how to stop the conflict or change the code of one so its done differently.p  pThis is where Im hoping the community can help me. If there is anything else you need to know or questions you have, please let me know.p  pThanks in advance.p  pdiv classsnippet datalangjs datahidefalse div classsnippetcode pre classsnippetcodehtml langhtml prettyprintoverridecodelt Start of live flights table gt ltdiv classcolmd12 pagecontentgt   lth2gtLive Flightslth2gt   ltdiv classstatstablegt     lttablegt       lttrgt         ltthgtPilotltthgt         ltthgtFlightltthgt         ltthgtDepartureltthgt         ltthgtArrivalltthgt         ltthgtAircraftltthgt         ltthgtStatusltthgt       lttrgt       ltphp resultsA CARSDataGetACARSData if countresultsgt0  foreachresults as flight  gt       lttrgt         ltphp count1 0 pirepsP IREPDatagetRecentReportsByCountcount gt         ltphp ifflightgtphasedetail  Boarding  echo          ltimg stylepaddingleft3px srcgt  elseifflightgtphasedetail  Arrived  echo          ltimg stylepaddingleft3px srcgt  elseifflightgtphasedetail  On Approach  echo          ltimg stylepaddingleft3px srcgt  gt          ltphp foreach pireps as pirep  pilotinfoP ilotDatagetPilotDatapirepgtpilotid pilotid  PilotDatagetPilotCodepilotinfogtcode, pilotinfogtpilotid  gt         lttdgt           ltphp echo lta href.SITEURL. index.phpprofileview.pilotinfogtpilotid.gt.pilotinfogtfirstname. .pilotinfogtlastname.ltagtgtlttdgt         lttdgt           ltphp echo flightgtflightnumgtlttdgt         lttdgt           ltphp echo flightgtdepnamegtlttdgt         lttdgt           ltphp echo flightgtarrnamegtlttdgt         lttdgt           ltphp echo flightgtaircraftnamegtlttdgt         lttdgt           ltphp ifflightgtphasedetail  Paused  echo flightgtphasedetail  else  echo Cruise gtltfontgt         lttdgt       lttrgt       ltphp   else  gt       lttrgt         lttd width20 aligncenter colspan6 stylepadding 5px fontsize 13px fontweight bold color 3399FFgtNo Flights in Progresslttdgt       lttrgt       ltphp  gt     lttablegt   ltdivgt ltdivgt lt Start of recent flights table gt ltdiv classcolmd12 pagecontentgt   lth2gtRecent Flightslth2gt   ltdiv classstatstablegt     lttablegt       lttrgt         ltthgtFlightltthgt         ltthgtPilotltthgt         ltthgtDepartureltthgt         ltthgtArrivalltthgt         ltthgtAircraftltthgt         ltthgtDurationltthgt         ltthgtVSltthgt         ltthgtInfoltthgt       lttrgt       ltphp count1 0 pirepsP IREPDatagetRecentReportsByCountcount gt       ltphp if countresultsgt0 if countpireps gt 0  foreach results as flight foreach pireps as pirep  pilotinfo  PilotDatagetPilotDatapirepgtpilotid pilotid  PilotDatagetPilotCodepilotinfogtcode, pilotinfogtpilotid acrid  OperationsDatagetAircraftByRegpirepgtregistration       results  ACARSDataGetACARSData fcode  substrflightgtflightnum, 0, 3 echo        lttrgt echo          lttdgtlta href.SITEURL.index.phppirepsviewreport.pirepgtpirepid.gt.pirepgtcode.pirepgtflightnum.ltagt         lttdgt echo          lttdgtlta href.SITEURL.index.phpprofileview.pilotinfogtpilotid.gt.pilotinfogtfirstname. .pilotinfogtlastname.ltagt         lttdgt echo          lttdgt.pirepgtdepicao.lttdgt echo          lttdgt.pirepgtarricao.lttdgt echo          lttdgt.pirepgtaircraft.lttdgt echo          lttdgt.pirepgtflighttime.lttdgt echo          lttdgt.pirepgtlandingrate. ftmlttdgt ifpirepgtaccepted  PIREPACCEPTED echo          lttdgtltspan classlabel labelimportantgtltfont colorgreengtAcceptedltfontgtltspangt         lttdgt elseifpirepgtaccepted  PIREPREJECTED echo          lttdgtltspan classlabel labelimportantgtltfont colorredgtRejectedltfontgtltspangt         lttdgt elseifpirepgtaccepted  PIREPPENDING echo          lttdgtltspan classlabel labelwarninggtltfont colororangegtPendingltfontgtltspangt         lttdgt elseifpirepgtaccepted  PIREPINPROGRESS echo          lttdgtOn Progresslttdgt echo lttrgt   else  echo        lttrgt         lttdgtThere are no recent Flightslttdgt       lttrgt  gt     lttablegt   ltdivgt   lt End of recent flights table gt ltdivgt lt Start of booked flights table gt ltdiv classcolmd12 pagecontentgt   lth2gtBooked Flightslth2gt   ltdiv classstatstablegt     ltphp MainControllerRun FrontBids, RecentFrontPage, 10 gt   ltdivgt ltdivgtcodepre div div p
Negative 4367 pI am using mouseover and mouseleave on different transparent  tags to swap a background image on my page. if I click on one of the  tags, the function is exited and the mouseover background image remains. on click also sets a div display to block, that was set to none in css.

Negative 4367 pComing back to Haskell four years after the first glimpse of it. Im always as amazed by the expressiveness, and as baffled by my inability to predict spacetime performance.p  pAs a warm up, I took to translating a tiny toy program I had written in C. Its about cheating at Scrabble. You input your game, and it outputs possible words you may play, with your letters alone or by crossing a letter on the board.p  pThe whole thing revolves around a dictionary thats preloaded at start up. The words are then stored as lists in a map, together with their anagrams. The keys are strings of sorted letters. An example will speak more clearly  p  precodeKey  AEHPS  Value  [HEAPS,PHASE,SHAPE] codepre  pThe C version reads the 320000 words of the dictionary one at a time, in about 200ms in total. The resulting data structure is a hashmap stored in a codearraylt99991, vectorltstringgtgtcode and takes up about 12 megabytes of memory.p  pThe Haskell version reads the same dictionary in about 5 seconds, and the program heap size was ballooning up to 400 megabytes  I changed the value type in the codeData.Mapcode from code[String]code to code[ByteString]code to save some memory, and that brought the program memory consumption down to roughly 290 megabytes. Thats still 24 times more than my C version. Thats more than mere overhead, even though codeData.Mapcode is a tree instead of an array.p  pSo I assume that Im doing something wrong.p  pThe whole module is visible here  deprecated linkp  pI suppose that my trouble has something to do with the way that codeData.Mapcode gets built incrementally, growing upon previous versions of itself  Or with the data structure itself  Or something else p  pIll try other solutions, like codeData.HashMapcode, or filling up codeData.Mapcode with codefromListWithcode. Nevertheless, Id like to build up some understanding of whats going on here. Thanks a lot for any insight p  hr  pShort answer p  pUsing Data.Map.Strict, forcing the evaluation of value elements, and storing the keys as ByteStrings too made the miracle of dividing the memory footprint nearly by 3. The result is 100Meg, which is only twice larger than a standard codestdmultimapltstdstring, stdstringgtcode in C for the same dataset. No speedup though. Git updated.p  pThanks a lot to all who contributed, there is interesting material down here p

Negative 4367 pI am trying to set up a similar process to what Web Essentials offered in the old visual studio in the newest one. For those of you who arent familiar with how that worked, the process wasp  precodeFile Setup     a.less         a.css             a.min.css             a.css.map       b.less         b.css             b.min.css             b.css.map codepre  pSo basically when you open a.less and start editing it, it would automatically check out a.css, a.min.css, and a.css.map as well. Then when you save, it would recompile the 3 sub files as well as saving the less file.p  pI am able to replicate this by writing a separate task for each file like sop  precodegulp.taskcheckout, function       return gulp.srcStylesbrands.css         .pipetfs    gulp.taskless, [checkout], function       delStylesbrands.css      return gulp.srcStylesbrands.less         .pipeless         .pipegulp.destStyles  codepre  pThis uses gulptfscheckout to checkout the sub file, and then the less to compile. This works 100 how I expect it to. I can set up a watch to watch the less task and everything will work great. The only problem is, how do I expand this to handle all my less files in that folder I could write separate checkout and compile tasks for each file, but thats not really ideal. p  pI am used to writing projects where saving any less file compiles and concats all of them into a single or a couple files, but this is a work project and for multiple reasons I need to keep the css files separate as they are now. We use visual studios bundling, but its an older project and people have referenced the css files randomly outside of the bundling process so it would be a pretty bigrisky task to change that.p  pI dont know how to watch many files, but only change the current one if that makes sense.p  precodegulp.taskless, function       return gulp.srcStyles.less watch all of my files         .pipetfscheckout only the css file for the less file that was changed here somehow         .pipeless compile only the css file that was changed         .pipegulp.destStyles  codepre  pI am fairly used to grunt and gulp, but like I said I generally do things in bulk on my project. Im not sure how to do this when I want to watch all the files, but only change 1p
Negative 4367 pIm trying to write a script to automatically run a program .exe, or a shortcut from the desktop on Windows 7.

see, ATL is the first codeSourcecode that I have described and is giving me this problem. I cannot figure out why this is so. It is being processed the same way as every other line in the file. If you notice, when I call codeprintAllPathscode, it really shows the problem of what is happening. The algorithm tries to print all paths from the first line but never considers anything after that. But yet if I want to find the shortest path from any other line to anywhere else, including ATL, it works just fine. Everything works but that one line. I have no idea why.p  pCan anyone help me find this bugp

Negative 4367 pstrongForewordstrongp  pI know that there are a number of delete duplicate row solutions on here already, but I feel my query differs substantially enough to warrant a new question.p  pstrongBackgroundstrongp  pMy table serves as a historical archive of all product price points, overtime, by country.  It will keep the historical data indefinitely.p  pI have a daily price feed which contains 7 days worth of product price history and 7 days worth of future product prices.  The data contains prices by country, product code sku, price and date from date.  There is no date to the relevant price on a given day is derived from the date from field.p  pEach day there are a number of duplicates that would usually exist as mostly the same data is sent day after day, and a given productprice may appear up to 14 times because it is sent daily over 14 days.  I overcome this with the UNIQUE KEY of skucountrydateindex sku, country, datefrom  where this prevents these types of duplicates.p  pHowever, the sending system isnt particularity smart and fairly often sends price change data even if the price was already at that price on the last recorded previous date e.g. 20150101  10, 20150103  10.  I would like to remove these unnecessary price rows.p  pOther solutions posted here, provided information on deleting exact duplicate rows e.g. delete all rows, bar one, where a price for product X is duplicated  this isnt suitable, as a price can go up and down over time and may have that same price at a later date with price changes in between.p  pstrongQuestionstrongp  pHow do I delete rows in mysql where a specific field is duplicated chronologically next to the other duplication.p  pstrongSetupstrongp  pTablep  precodeCREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS price    importid int10 unsigned NOT NULL AUTOINCREMENT,   country varchar2 COLLATE utf8bin DEFAULT NULL,   sku varchar7 COLLATE utf8bin DEFAULT NULL,   datefrom date DEFAULT NULL,   price decimal10,2 DEFAULT NULL,   PRIMARY KEY importid,   UNIQUE KEY skucountrydateindex sku,country,datefrom,   KEY skuindex sku,   KEY countryindex country,   KEY datefromindex datefrom  ENGINEInnoDB DEFAULT CHARSETutf8 COLLATEutf8bin AUTOINCREMENT1 codepre  pExample Datap  precodeREPLACE INTO price country, sku, price, datefrom VALUES uk, 123, 10.00, 20150101, uk, 123, 11.00, 20150104, uk, 123, 9.00, 20150106, uk, 123, 9.00, 20150109, uk, 123, 9.00, 20150113, uk, 123, 10.00, 20150116, uk, 123, 9.00, 20150120, uk, 123, 10.00, 20150125, uk, 124, 10.00, 20150106, uk, 125, 10.00, 20150106, ie, 123, 10.00, 20150106, ie, 123, 14.00, 20150107, ie, 125, 10.00, 20150106 codepre  pRequirementsp  pDelete the following two rows, as they are not required to determine a product price on a given day  p  precodeuk, 123, 9.00, 20150109, uk, 123, 9.00, 20150113, codepre  pThe solution can be part of the CREATE or REPLACE statements  or even be a subsequent DELETE.p  pstrongMy Approachstrongp  pFor reference the below is the approach I took which unfortunately deletes too many rows.

If there is it will begin flashing the new firmware. Whats a good method to ensure this is atomic Is the bootloader the best place to do this or would something else be more appropriatep

Negative 4367 pIm using Parse for my iOS app and Im trying to locally save my HTML file from Parse core data to my devices local storage. Im doing this so the user can still access the data even when theyre offline. Ive read about local datastore and cache policy and have tried both. With local datastore, it doesnt let me load the HTML to my UIWebView but it loads everything else probably due to the HTML needing internet to access it. Cache policy actually works but only accesses the more recent items just as a cache should work. p  pI am asking on here to see what I can do to locally save these HTML files from Parse so a user can access them even when the internet is gone. p  pThanks p

Negative 4367 pIm creating a game, the background color is white to begin with hencep  precodeself.backgroundColor  SKColor.whiteColor codepre  pSo when the game initiates white is the background. I have a scoring system, so essentially I want the colors to change when a certain score is reached hencep  precodeif score lt 100             enemy.runActionSKAction.moveTomainBall.position, duration3                    else if score gt 100 ampamp score lt 200             enemy.runActionSKAction.moveTomainBall.position, duration2.5             self.backgroundColor  SKColor.purpleColor                  else if score gt 200 ampamp score lt 300             enemy.runActionSKAction.moveTomainBall.position, duration2             self.backgroundColor  SKColor.greenColor          codepre  phowever, this method is very clunky and looks pretty awful if Im honest. Everything in my game is fluid and contains fades when being removed from the scene usingp  precodelivesLabel.runActionSKAction.fadeInWithDuration0.5 codepre  pBut I am unsure as to how I would proceed to do this with the background color. If I use the above example with backgroundColor such as p  precodeself.backgroundColor  SKAction.fadeInWithDurationSKColor.purpleColor codepre  pI get the error Cannot invoke fadeInWithDuration with an argument list of type UIColorp  pNote I understand completely that attempting to assign the background color to an animation is silly. But I put that code in there to try get my problem acrossp

Negative 4367 pstrongQuestion Is using exceptions the proper way to terminate my program if all I want is to display an error message and close accounting that I may be deep in the program Can I just explicitly call something like exit insteadstrongp  pstrongWhat Im Currently Doingstrongp  pIm working on a game project and am trying to figure out the best way to terminate the program in the case of an error that calls for such an action.

Negative 4367 pI have a question related to the WordPressltJoomla compatibility. Recently I purchased a sophisticated plugin which runs on WordPress only. But my website with all the content and the design is based on Joomla. So Im trying to figure out the means how I could use that WordPress plugin on the Joomla website. As I said before its kind of advanced plugin with many options, so I guess it would be difficult to adapt the code to fit Joomla requirements. So Im thinking about two possible solutionsp  ol lipI could create a WordPress website with the same design that Joomla website has. However this solution requires to change all the Joomla template files, or to build the WordPress theme from scratch. Does anybody know any tutorial which explains how to migrate the template from Joomla to WordPress I basically dont need to move the content, only the design. All the menu links and other stuff would redirect to the parent Joomla site.pli lipThe second solution I think would be to install the WordPress with that plugin on the server and then to create a copy of the Joomla site on the subdomain. Then maybe I can use something like iframe on the Joomla site to show the WordPress plugin running. Is that kind of scenario possible What kind of solution would you suggest As I said before, I will keep my Joomla site anyway, because its already running with tons of data. I just need the functionality of one additional plugin, which sadly runs only on WordPress.pli ol  pThanks for the help.p

All the processes, from PuTTy, to Chrome, to Firefox. There were a lot of those already running in the background. The odd thing is that the user column of these processes is set to SYSTEM, while the normal browser sessions, for example, the user is set to IT, which is my current Windows user account.p  pI have been trying to manually change the user in which these processes are invoked, but no luck so far. p  pSo apparently, my application works in Windows as well, just not as I intended. All the processes, regardless if its a command line script or a desktop application like firefox or chrome, they just dont appear but they run in the background under the user SYSTEM. And I dont have any idea why. It sure doesnt look like its supposed to be the default behavior. So if anyone have any idea, Id really appreciate it. p  pThanks.p
