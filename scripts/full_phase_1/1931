Positive 1931 pAs a preface, our setup is somewhat unusual due to legacy reasons. It is fully possible that I am going against the grain with this. I would love to get an expert opinion on whether it is possible to get my current setup working or a suggestion on a different approach.p  h2Environmenth2  pJava application with over 10K unit tests in JUnit. For legacy reasons the entire unit test run takes a long time the ultimate goal is to fix the root of the problem, but this will not happen soon.p  pThe application is broken up into multiple modules, with each module having its own unit tests. Executing tests module by module takes a reasonable amount of time, so that if someone commits the code to repo subtree with modules code and only modules tests get executed, they can get a result quickly.p  h2Current Jenkins Setuph2  h3JUnit jobh3  pThis is the single emparameterizedem job that can run tests for any module. The job takes in as parameters the regexs for which tests to run and a parameter indicating which module it is running, for notification purposes. It checks out emthe wholeem repo tree and then does the run based on the parameters.p  pAfter the completion of the run this job does the analysis of JUnits, publishes the report and sends out email notifications.p  h3Repo watchersh3  pOne repo watcher for each module. The watcher checks out only the repo subtree that it wants to monitor. When a change is detected it triggers the JUnit job telling it which tests to run and for what component this is.p  h2Questionh2  pIn general the setup works well, does exactly what I need, however it breaks a few of the nice and expected features of Jenkins and JUnit plugin.p  ol liBecause the same job keeps executing different subsets of unit tests, the job to job comparison between unit tests does not provide any value. Without manually scanning between jobs it is not possible to tell what changed in terms of new failures or new fixes to unit tests.li liSomething very similar happens to change history  Each repo watches runs on its own schedule. Suppose we have a change to module A and a change to module B, very close time wise to each other. If watcher A triggers first, the JUnit job triggered by watcher A will claim both changes. When the JUnit job triggered by watcher B runs, it will not detect any new changes in the repo. This plays havoc with email notifications, as the second JUnit job would not know who broke the build.li ol  pAt the end of the day I believe I am looking for a way to establish dependency relationship between non sequential job runs in Jenkins for the same job, or alternatively a totally different approach.p  pThank youp

Positive 1931 pI discovered that some instance of a java class that I used in Maps and Sets sometimes fails to be found using the codecontainscode method.p  pThe problem was emsimplyem that the class did not implement hashCode but it has codeequalscode.

The customer data for this app is being moved into Microsoft Dynamics CRM 4.0, and I need to modify the ASP sites authentication to look up user credentials in Dynamics CRM instead.p  pHeres the possible approaches Ive come up with so farp  ol liMove all the authentication tokens into explicit cookies instead of relying on Session variables then rewrite the login pages, etc. as .aspx pages, and connected to the Dynamics web service from within these pages using the WSDLgenerated wrapper class.li liCreate a COM wrapper around the WSDLgenerated wrapper class, and invoke this using Server.CreateObject from within the legacy ASP pagesli liWrite a JSON wrapper around the WSDL interface, and call this from within legacy ASP using the MSXML2.ServerXMLHTTP COM object or something similarli liCall WSDL from ASP directly and parse the results using MSXML or something.li ol  pIm thinking option 1 is probably the best at this stage, but Im hoping someone out there has tried this before and can share the benefit of their experiencep

One of the Features is to use a webbased Painter think of MSPaint on the Web, which I embed on the Page on Demand. After the image is painted and uploaded, the Webapp then unloads the applet and proceeds to show the directory where the file was uploaded to.p  pThis is where Trouble starts. It all works on IE and Safari, but not on Firefox 3.5 3.0 works perfectly though. Firebug tells me that the expando property is missing.p  pThe Webapp Tiparlo which I was working on before had a similar Problem in fact, any manipulation done on an applet via jQuery is faulty but solved that Problem by wrapping a div around and controlling hide and show the div instead of the applet. This, unfortunately isnt applicable on this Webapp, because the Applet has to be destroyed and not just hidden and shown, as it takes up too much resources to be run the entire time where it is not needed.p  pTo make it short Is it possible to make an Applet destroy itself via Javascript Alternatively Is there a workaround on the jQueryexpandoapplet problem I know that applet is deprecated in HTML 4.01 strict but changing it to object is not an option right now.p  pEDIT I have added a Picture of Firefox  Firebug to show you the actual Error Message.

Negative 1931 pWe have a database of movies and series, and as the data comes from many sources of varying reliability, wed like to be able to do fuzzy string matching on the titles of episodes.

Negative 1931 pIm quite new to jQuery, and Ive written a simple function to check the strength of a password for each keypress.p  pThe idea is that every time a user enters a character, the contents is evaluated to test the strengh of the password they have entered...

When a digit is used the score increments by 1 again, same for when an uppercase character is used and when the password becomes 5 or more characters long.p  pWhat is returned is the strength of the password so far as a value from 1 to 5 every time a key is pressed.p  pSo, about my question.

Negative 1931 pI have a widget that displays a filesystem hierarchy for convenient browsing basically a tree control and some associated toolbar buttons, such as refresh. Each of these widgets has a set of base directories for it to display recursively. Assume that the user may instantiate as many of these widgets as they find convenient. Note that these widgets dont correspond to any business data  theyre independent of the model.p  pstrongWhere should the perwidget set of base directories live in good MVC designstrongp  pWhen the refresh button is pushed, an event is trapped by the controller, and the event contains the corresponding filesystembrowser widget. The controller determines the base directories for that particular widget somehow, walks that directory path, and passes the widget some data to render.p  pTwo places I can think to store the base directoriesp  ol liThe easy solution make the base directories an instance variable on the widget and have the controller manipulate it to retain state for that widget. Theres a conceptual issue with this, though since the widget never looks at that instance variable, youre just projecting one of the responsibilities of the controller onto the widget.li liThe more technically, maybe conceptually complex solution Keep a codewidget basedirectorysetcode mapping in the controller with weak key references.li ol  pThe second way allows for easy expansion of controller responsibilities later on, as putting things in the controller tends to do  for example, if I decided I later wanted to determine the set of all the base directories for all those widgets.p  pThere may be some piece of MVC knowledge Im missing that solves this kind of problem well.p

If locking failed, check process list for this pid. If pid not found, probably process failed at some point and its safe to srart new one.  Via the wrapper for gevent pool run task for rss feeds download, at every stage new items found add new job to quique to download item, at every item downloaded add tasks for image downloading.  Check every some seconds state of jobs currenly running, run new job from quique if there free slots available in FIFO mode.p  pSound OK for me, however maybe this kind of task has some best practise and Im reinventing the wheel now.

Negative 1931 pI am using Entity Framework 4 and am having a few problems with lazy loading. I have 3 entities and are each contained in one another. CarSetup will contain a Car entity who will contain an Event entity. They are all being lazy loaded.p  pI have created a simplistic unit test to reproduce the problem.p  precodeCarSetup carSetup  carSetupContext.CreateObjectltCarSetupgt Car car  Loadcar1 carSetup.Car  car codepre  pI get a crash when i assign the car to the carsetup object. It actually crashes in the Equals method of the Car entity.p  precodepublic override bool Equalsobject obj      ifobj  null              return false           return this.Event.EqualsCarobj.Event  codepre  pIf i quickwatch the entity before the equals method gets called, all sub entities get loaded and the problem does not occur. p  pWhen i assign the existing car to the car setup, the framework loads all existing CarSetups for that car and calls my Equals method with them. However, since lazy loading is enabled, the Event in the Car is null which is normal. When it tries to access the Event property, NO loading happens and it crashes. I have checked the this property in the equals method and it is of type System.Data.Entity.DynamicProxies.Car. I also checked and the EventId Guid is correctly set in the car entity.p  pAnyone have any idea as to what is happeningp  pEDIT After doing a bit more testing, if I call my equals method manualyp  precodecar.Equalscar codepre  pEverything works perfectly. It only happens when the Entity Framework decides to load relationships and automatically calls the Equals method. p  pThanksp
Negative 1931 pI am using the newest Facebook iPhone SDK which uses the OAuth authentication, and I have it almost all working except one part.  Ive created a session on the iPhone, and I would like to continue that session on a php server for further processing such as getting the high scores of a persons friends.  With the old iPhone SDK, all you had to do was pass the session from the iPhone application to the PHP page and you could go from there.p  pHowever, it seems like the new SDK is more security conscious and it is more difficult to continue sessions.  From what Ive read, it looks like I have to use an access token to continue the session on the php page.  In the Facebook SDK, there is an access token variable that looks like it is encrypted.  In order to use this access token I think that I need to decrypt it, somehow.  I found a hrefhttpsambro.issuperawesome.com20100528facebookaccesstokensfromcanvasapps relnofollowthisa page which looks like it could help with decrypting that access token, but I always receive a NULL response.p  pIve tried so many things and Im running out of ideas.  Am I approaching this correctly  Or do I need to go a completely different routep  pThanks, Justinp
Negative 1931 pI want to call a partial method from outside of the declaring class. This is not allowed as partial methods are implicitly private. You can not set a delegate to point to a partial so I am proposing the followingp  precode  public partial class MyClass          AnotherClass anotherClass        public MyClass             anotherClass  new AnotherClass          anotherClass.Method  new Action gt                          this.Method                          partial void Method        sometimes this method will be implemented       partial void Method           do something                public class AnotherClass         public Action Method  get set        public void SomeOtherMethod          this.Method            codepre  pThe classes are tightly coupled, they are in a parent child relationship. I want the parent to have a method that it can override  to know about property changes on the child. I could attach event handlers to each of the children however the child already knows about its parent so having the child inform the parent directly seems like the way to go. Except when the parent strongdoes not carestrong which is why I want to be able to implement a partial if I do care. This question is basically about ease of programming vs performance. I know I could attach event handlers only to the situation where I do care, but with the implementation as above I can generate all the partial methods and only implement the partials if I care.p  pMy question relates to the times that the partial method codeMethodcode is not implemented. When the Action method is called will the compiler optimise it away as its body is empty If I get a heap of these Action calls being made could I suffer a performance penalty Is there a better way to get the same functionalityp

These steps are repeated for each file requested.li liOnce all requested templates for a user are generated, they are grouped together in a zip file and a link for downloading is sent via email.li ol  pI would like some advice on how best to accept the users requests and process the files in ASP.NET.p  pOne way of doing this is to keep the user waiting until all files are generated, therefore until the form handling script would have completed its execution.

From what I can tell, the argument passed to codeformcode is the return URL after signing in.  For example, if I put httpwww.yahoo.com it will take me there after every login attempt.  I feel like this should point back to my own controller and just check there, but the convention seems to be to use the web.webopenid.host controller, which I guess handles the id and returns to the base  url.  I think Im getting there, but the status returned is always codeNonecode.  p  pFrom what I gather then, this is either a code issue, or theres something in my apache configuration that is keeping the authentication from working.  In web.webopenid, the library creates a .openidsecretkey file in the same directory as the web server.  When I run the example code, this gets created.  When I run my code through apache, it does not at least not in the cgibin.  Somewhere else  Anyway, if this file isnt being generated or being regenerated every time, it will keep me from logging in.  I believe its an apache issue as I tried running my app through the web.py webserver and I did get the file created and I can authenticate.  All I can conclude is this file isnt being written and every subsequent query tries a new file and I can never authentication.  Can any apachemodwsgi gurus explain to me where this file is being written or if this is the actual problem  p
Negative 1931 pIs there any way to restart Visual Studio 2010 and possibly 2008 as well but not so important manually and keeping the current state i.e. all open solutionsprojects and files Basically the same operation as when you install an extension and Visual Studio asks to restart itself. Occasionally Visual Studio gets confused after things like folder renamesmoves, reference changes or the GUI editor throws a wobbly so it would be nice to be able to quickly restart the solutionproject rather than close Visual Studio, reopen it and load the solutionproject again.p

Negative 1931 pIs this senerio validp  pI have a View to maintain an Item.p  pI have View Model which exposes the Item Object implements INotifyPropertyChanged as a Property to which is View is bound.p  pIs it valid for me to pass the Item object to a Backgroundworker where it is modified, then raise the PropertyChanged event when the BackgroundWorking is completep  pOr should the BackgroundWorker in no way modify the Item object. I would update the existing Item object with the results passed back by the BackgroundWorker. This would be done in the RunWorkerCompleted event. But does this lock the UI thread and defeat the object of having a backgound workerp  pConfusedp  pIll try to explain.p  pThe User takes an option to create an Item. I create the View and View Model. In the View model an empty Item object is created. He is presented with a View to maintain the Item. On selecting the Item Type property, this instigates a complex process to create a list of proerties to be entered by the User. I could block the UI thread whilst the list is created but this gives a poor user experience. I want to pass the processing to a background thread while keeping the UI alive. At present, I set a flag to indicate the section on the View is loading, pass the Item object to the BackgroundWorker which updates the observable collection of Properties. When the BackgroundWorking is complete I call the PropertyChanged event which updates the section of the View which is bound to the list and turn off the flag to indicate the section is loading. This seems to work with no issues. But I have a gut feeling that I should not be updating bound onjects from the View Model in a background thread.p  pThanks Timp

Negative 1931 pI have a class in a windows service application that calls codeMessageQueue.BeginReceivecode to get messages from a queue as they arrive. Previously this was being done in the context of the services main thread, but I moved it to a separate thread one per queue.p  pThe codeBeginReceivecode call is inherently nonblocking thats the whole point of the method. I believe internally the runtime uses an IO completion port IOCP to accomplish the async magic, on what I assume as well is a separate managed thread IOCPs are nice, but they emareem blocking.p  pWhen I rewrote the queue reader class to run in a separate thread I did so with the expectation that the async receive would not be useful anymore, as it would fail to block, causing the thread proc to exit immediately. I assumed I would have to switch to a polling solution instead.p  pSo I was surprised when I ran the reader for the first time on a separate thread and somehow the BeginReceiveEndReceive call is I think causing the thread to block until the queue is closed. p  pIOW, I expected the thread proc to return as soon as BeginReceive was called, since its not blocking. But it doesnt work that way. The version of the reader class that uses it just sits there happily receiving messages on the separate thread until I signal for it to exit and the queue is closed.p  pNow dont get me wrong, this is nice. But Im trying to understand why the managed thread is somehow being blocked from exiting by an operation that happens in a separate thread BeginReceive and about which it knows absolutely nothing. I need to know how this works in order to decide if its a viable, stable approach. Does the managed thread somehow know that theres a pending async operation or something like thatp
Negative 1931 pIve built a 2D grid in java where each cell can have a certain attribute, say color. At each iteration of the main loop, that color can possibly change.  p  pWhat I want to be able to dobr   when zoomed in, it will show a small subset of the grids and the actual color of each grid.br   as you zoom out and see more cells at once, the cells will start to get too small to be seen individually, so I want to be able to just represent that areaa collection of cells as a single color say the most often occurring one in that collection  p  pOne thing I thought of for doing this would be to use a hierarchical treepyramid structure, where at the leaves you have each cell. Each parent node contains summary information of each of its children.

Negative 1931 pHi Im playing around with locations on iPhone and right from the start I ran into problems. Ive localized my problem and determined its codeCLLocationManagercode thats bugging me.p  pSo I developed very simple application. I just have a view controller with a codeCLLocationManagercode in it. On view did load I initialize codeCLLocationManagercode and start updating. Ive also implemented two methods codedidFailWithErrorcode and codedidUpdateToLocationcode.p  pIve read a lot of questions and what i have learned so fare is this. You have to retain codeCLLocationManagercode during initialization. Also its wise to set codeCLLocationManagerscode codedelegatecode to codenilcode during unloading of a codeviewcode something to do with messages passing to codeCLLocationManagercode because framework retains it and its never properly releasep  pAll in all I just cant find a decent explanation on what to do and how to make it work.p  pHeres my code so if anybody could figure it out I would appreciate it.  codeviewControllerscode header filep  precodeimport ltUIKitUIKit.hgt import ltCoreLocationCoreLocation.hgt  interface CoreLocationViewController  UIViewController ltCLLocationManagerDelegategt      CLLocationManager locManager   property nonatomic, retain CLLocationManager locManager  end codepre  pviewController .m filep  precodeimport CoreLocationViewController.h   implementation CoreLocationViewController synthesize locManager   voidviewDidLoad       [super viewDidLoad]      self.locManager  [[CLLocationManager alloc] init]     locManager.delegate  self     [self.locManager startUpdatingLocation]      self.view.backgroundColor  [UIColor grayColor]   pragma mark  pragma mark Location Delegate   voidlocationManagerCLLocationManager manager didFailWithErrorNSError error          NSLogin fail with error    voidlocationManagerCLLocationManager manager didUpdateToLocationCLLocation newLocation fromLocationCLLocation oldLocation      NSLogin update to location    pragma mark  pragma mark Memory Management   voiddidReceiveMemoryWarning      [super didReceiveMemoryWarning]    voidviewDidUnload   self.locManager.delegate  nil     [super viewDidUnload]     voiddealloc       [locManager release]         [super dealloc]    end codepre  pBTW Im using iOS 4.2.

Negative 1931 pI recall reading about how exceptions could be caught without the use of trycatch. Basically when an exception is thrown such as Unhandled exception via derefencing a null pointer, there would be a process that is triggered even when a trycatch is not coded for the exception. I believe it had something to do with a top level library that you write then include in your code. Unfortunately documentation on such a method seems to be nonexistent but I have seenheard of such a method being done before. Could someone please explain how this is donep

Negative 1931 pWell, Ive tried to understand and read what could cause it but I just cant get itp  pI have somewhere in my code thisp  precode try  ..  m.invoketestObject  ..   catchAssertionError e  ...   catchException e  ..   codepre  pThing is that, when it tries to invoke some method it throws  codeInvocationTargetExceptioncode instead of some other expected exception specifically codeArrayIndexOutOfBoundsExceptioncode.  As I actually know what method is invoked I went straight to this method code and added a trycatch block for the line that suppose to throw  codeArrayIndexOutOfBoundsExceptioncode and it really threw codeArrayIndexOutOfBoundsExceptioncode as expected. Yet when going up it  somehow changes to codeInvocationTargetExceptioncode and in the code above codecatchException ecode   e is codeInvocationTargetExceptioncode and not codeArrayIndexOutOfBoundsExceptioncode  as expected.p  pWhat could cause such a behavior or how can I check such a thingp

Negative 1931 pI am attempting a manytomany list in one of my objects.  p  pI have three classes which I am attempting to save and load via NHibernate Intersection, Vehicle and Zone.  Intersection and Vehicle are both derived from Device.p  pThe Intersection class contains a list of Zones, which each zone may only belong to 1 Intersection, but each Intersection may contain multiple Zones.  I have this mapped correctly and it is saving the manytoone association of Zones to the Intersections just fine.p  pThe Vehicle class contains a List of Zones.  The Vehicle may belong to multiple Zones.  Also, the Zones contain a List of Vehicles.  Each Zone may contain multiple Vehicles.  Thus the manytomany relationship between the two.p  pAll the objects appear to be saved to the database correctly.  I can go through my tables and all the fields for each Intersection, Vehicle, and Zone are propagated correctly however, they are not loading the fields when I load the object using NHibernate.p  pI am hoping someone may be able to shed some light as to what may be going wrong here.p  pHere is my mapping of Device which includes the Intersection and Vehicle class mappingsp  precode

Negative 1931 pHeres my situation.  I have a graph that has different sets of data being added at different times. For example, set1 might have a few thousand nodes and then set2 comes in later and we apply business logic to create edges from set1 to set2and disgard any Vertices from set1 that do not have edges to set2.  Then at a later point, we get set3, set4, and so on and the same process applies between each set and its previous set.p  pQuestion, whats the best way to organize this  What I did before was name the nodes set1xx, set2xx,etc..  The problem I faced was when I was trying to run analytics between the current set and the previous set I would have to run a loop through the entire graph and look for all the nodes that started with setx.  It took a long time as the graph grew, so I thought of another solution which was to create a node called set1 and have it connected to all nodes for that particular set.

We can load the utility library like before via System.loadLibrary.p  pSo in the native method of the utility library what we need to do isp  pUsecodeinclude ltdlfcn.hgtcode  this is required to call dlopen and dlclose functions.brbr Provide handler and function prototypep  precodevoid handle typedef int funcint  define function prototype func myFunctionName  some name for the function codepre  pOpen the library via dlopen  p  precodehandle  dlopendatadatamy.package.comlibsomelibrary.so, RTLDLAZY codepre  pGet and Call the function of the libraryp  precodemyFunctionName  funcdlsymhandle, actualFunctionNameInLibrary myFunctionName1  passing parameters if needed in the call codepre  pNow that the call is done. Close it via dlclosep  precodedlclosehandle codepre  pHope this will help others facing the same issue.p

Negative 1931 pThis is a little weird and Im not sure what the heck is going on.  Im using a MKMapView that has a custom annotation on it.  In that annotation I have a text field that is editable.  When the user taps on the field, the keyboard comes up and I respond to that by movingshrinking my map view and recentering the annotation.  All is good, except on the iPad in landscape mode with a split keyboard.  Only in this situation, when I change the frame of my map view it then calls resignFirstResponder on my text field and begins animating the keyboard off screen.  As its being moved offscreen, my code responds to that by movingexpanding my mapview to fill in the space.  Then, my text field receives the message codebecomeFirstRespondercode again.  I checked the call stack and this is coming from code[UIViewHierarchy deferredBecomeFirstResponder]code.  The keyboard comes back up, which I respond to again and the cycle continues up  down  up  down  up  down.....on and on.  The coderesignFirstRespondercode is definitely coming from setting the frame of my map view.  If I set a break on the coderesignFirstRespondercode of my text field and check the call stack, the previous call is my setting the map view frame.  Also, if I break on my code that responds to the keyboard when its being dismissed I notice these calls on the stack immediately after my the map view frame is setp  precode6  0x001264cf in [CTView resignFirstResponder] 7  0x00e3bed7 in [UIView setUserInteractionEnabled]  8  0x00710020 in lldbunnamedfunction213MapKit  9  0x00714c14 in lldbunnamedfunction326MapKit  10 0x00716f82 in lldbunnamedfunction361MapKit  11 0x007168c4 in lldbunnamedfunction359MapKit  12 0x00716068 in lldbunnamedfunction344MapKit  13 0x00715c5c in lldbunnamedfunction343MapKit  14 0x007198d0 in lldbunnamedfunction385MapKit  15 0x0071a1ad in lldbunnamedfunction392MapKit  16 0x0071a417 in lldbunnamedfunction396MapKit  17 0x00711074 in lldbunnamedfunction255MapKit  codepre  pI can get around this by not resizing my map view.  If I dont, the cycle never starts up.  Instead, if I put the map view in a container view, set codeclipToBounds  YEScode on the container view and no auto resizing on the map view, I can resize the container view and leave the map view the same size....the problem is that its a work around.  If the user rotates the iPad, I need to change the size of the map view, but that will kick off this ugly cycle.p  pDoes anybody know whats going onp

Negative 1931 pI would like some information on how to correctly think about C11 closures and codestdfunctioncode in terms of how they are implemented and how memory is handled.p  pAlthough I dont believe in premature optimisation, I do have a habit of carefully considering the performance impact of my choices while writing new code.  I also do a fair amount of realtime programming, e.g. on microcontrollers and for audio systems, where nondeterministic memory allocationdeallocation pauses are to be avoided.p  pTherefore Id like to develop a better understanding of when to use or not use C lambdas.p  pMy current understanding is that a lambda with no captured closure is exactly like a C callback.  However, when the environment is captured either by value or by reference, an anonymous object is created on the stack.  When a valueclosure must be returned from a function, one wraps it in codestdfunctioncode.  What happens to the closure memory in this case  Is it copied from the stack to the heap  Is it freed whenever the codestdfunctioncode is freed, i.e., is it referencecounted like a codestdsharedptrcodep  pI imagine that in a realtime system I could set up a chain of lambda functions, passing B as a continuation argument to A, so that a processing pipeline codeAgtBcode is created.  In this case, the A and B closures would be allocated once.  Although Im not sure whether these would be allocated on the stack or the heap.  However in general this seems safe to use in a realtime system.  On the other hand if B constructs some lambda function C, which it returns, then the memory for C would be allocated and deallocated repeatedly, which would not be acceptable for realtime usage.p  pIn pseudocode, a DSP loop, which I think is going to be realtime safe.  I want to perform processing block A and then B, where A calls its argument.  Both these functions return codestdfunctioncode objects, so codefcode will be a codestdfunctioncode object, where its environment is stored on the heapp  precodeauto f  AB   A returns a function which calls B                  Memory for the function returned by A is on the heap                  Note that A and B may maintain a state                  via mutable valueclosure for t0 tlt1000 t      y  ft  codepre  pAnd one which I think might be bad to use in realtime codep  precodefor t0 tlt1000 t      y  ABt  codepre  pAnd one where I think stack memory is likely used for the closurep  precodefreq  220 A  2 for t0 tlt1000 t      y  []int t return sintfreqA   codepre  pIn the latter case the closure is constructed at each iteration of the loop, but unlike the previous example it is cheap because it is just like a function call, no heap allocations are made.  Moreover, I wonder if a compiler could lift the closure and make inlining optimisations.p  pIs this correct  Thank you.p
Negative 1931 pWe have an application made in Delphi 7 that has been evolving for over a decade.  We are currently migrating to XE2, but that will take a bit of time.p  pI recently discovered FastMM replacement memory manager.  After reading this seems like a nobrainer step for any application in Delphi 7 or earlier. Sadly, we are just discovering it I suppose to do lack of knowledge or exposure.p  pMy question is are there other additions like FastMM that are also no brainers when creating an application with Delphi 7, other small tweaks, components, tools or units like this one that most people would agree should be added to virtually any application for Delphi 7.  I know many things have come to light over the years or components come into existence that we may not be aware of.  Googling for this information gives most out of date results.p  pAny guidance is appreciated.p

Negative 1931 pdo you have guys any experience with way how modern scalable reservation systems works  e.g. airports or transport agencies p  pWe just found serious flaw in reservation system of our customer. They reserve seat for each user which search for travel connection. That means if transport capacity is e.g. 200 and there is 200 people searching for the same trip all those got reservationwith timeout e.g. 5minutes so if there is marketing event and  thousands of people go on the site they actually cant see most searched trips because other users prereserved that already. This is not scalable. p  pI cant believe it works this way but thats real app architecture. How you would ideally handle reservation situations  p  pTo make it more complicated, from the number of prereserved seats price is computed and so its different for each user price changes as seats reservation changes.p  pFor sure we will try to rip off that prereservation step, but then some people will be refused in the last step before booking so that will be disadvantage...p

Negative 1931 pIn Linux, when a process try to access a page that doesnt have a current physical mapping missing page table entry, a page fault is generated by CPU. This causes Linuxs page fault handler to be invoked. If this fault is major, meaning Linux has to read the page from the swap device, the handler has to read from the actual disk in this case. Since reading from a disk is asynchronous submitbio, does this cause the process to reschedule And wake up when IO is completep  pIf reschedule does happen, where is the call to schedule Reading the code in mmswapstate.c doesnt give me a clue as to when or if this happens.p

Negative 1931 pIm looking for an example of code that samples signal from microphone and plays it on speakers. I need a solution that has a resonably constant delay on different platforms PC, android, iphone. Delay around 12 s is ok for me, and I dont mind if it varies everytime the application starts.p  pI tried using SampleDataEvent.SAMPLEDATA event on Sound and Microphpne classess. One event would put data into buffer the other would read data. But it seems impossible to provide constant delay, either the delay grows constantly or it gets lower to the point where I have less than 2048 samples to put out and Sound class stops generating SampleDataEvent.SAMPLEDATA events.p  pI want to process each incoming frame so using setLoopBacktrue is not an option.p  pps This is more a problem on Android devices than on PC. Althought when I start to resize application window on PC delay starts to grow also.p  pPlease help.p

Negative 1931 pIm not quite sure how to phrase this, but is there a good way to implement a table where the columns are essentially interchangeablep  pExample you have a Users model and want to allow two Users to be friends. The obvious way, to me, would be to have a table containing two columns friend1 and friend2 that each containing the key to a User.

Negative 1931 pI noticed that LoDash has a special Underscorecompatible build, ostensibly to address differences in function argumentsoperations since LoDash is a superset of Underscore, I assume there are no Underscore functions missing from LoDash.p  pIve also noticed that BackboneJS can be used with either Underscore or LoDash.p  pMy question would it be unwise to use a normal build of LoDash with BackboneJS I cant find any indication of whether or not people are doing this in the wild, but it seems like a bad idea, especially if BackboneJS relies on functions that may be different in these builds. At the same time, it would be nice to use some of the newer functions in LoDash, so Id hate to miss out on those if it isnt necessary.p

Negative 1931 pIt seems that Java cannot use windows credentials. I need to copy files from server that requires credentials to local folder.p  pI used JCIFS plugin to copy from server using samba protocol.

Negative 1931 pI know that a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions1205375filterbypropertyfiltering by propertya is not possible with Django, as filtering is done at database level and properties live in Python code. However, I have the following scenariop  pIn one hand, I have the model codeRegisteredUsercode on the other hand codeSubscriptioncode. A user can have multiple subscriptions, a subscription is from one user and a user has one or none active subscriptions.p  pTo implement this, I have a foreign key from codeSubscriptioncode to codeRegisteredUsercode and a property codesubscriptioncode at codeRegisteredUsercode that points to the active one latest created subscription for that user or none if he hasnt any subscriptions.p  pWhich would be the most efficent way to filter users that have subscription platinum, gold, silver... I could do a fetch all subscriptions and then iterate over them to check each one for a match. But it would be really expensive and if I have to do the same process for each kind of subscription type, then cost would be s  u where codescode is the number of different subscriptions and codeucode is the number of users.p  pAny help will be appreciated. Thanks in advancep  pstrongUPDATEstrongp  pWhen I first explained the problem, I didnt include all the models related to simplify a litte. But as you are asking me for the models and some of you havent understood me perhaps I wasnt clear enough here you have the code. Ive simplified the models and stripped out code that is not important now.p  pWhat do I have here A codeRegisteredUsercode can have many subscriptions because he may change it as many times as he wants, and a subscription is from just one user. The user has only one current subscription, which is the latest one and is returned by the property codesubscriptioncode. codeSubscriptioncode is attached with codeMembershipcode and this is the model whose codeslugcode can be platinum, gold, silver, etc.p  pWhat do I need I need to lookup codeContentcode whose codeauthorcode has a specific kind of membership. If the property approach worked, Id have done it like thisp  precodeContent.objects.filterauthoridinRegisteredUser.objects.filter     subscriptionmembershipsluggold codepre  pBut I cant do this because properties cant be used when filteringp  pI thought that I could solve the problem converting the virtual relation created by the property into a real ForeignKey, but this may cause side effects, as I should update it manually each time a user changes its subscription and now its automatic Any better ideasp  pThanks so muchp  precodeclass RegisteredUserAbstractUser     birthdate  models.DateFieldBirthdate, blankTrue, nullTrue     phonenumber  models.CharFieldPhone number, maxlength9, blankTrue, default      property     def subscriptionself         try             return self.subscriptionsset.filteractiveTrue.orderbydatejoined,                 created[0]         except IndexError             return None   class Subscriptionmodels.Model     datejoined  models.DateFieldDate joined, defaulttimezone.now     datecanceled  models.DateFieldDate canceled, blankTrue, nullTrue     subscriber  models.ForeignKeyAUTHUSERMODEL, verbosenameSubscriber,         relatednamesubscriptionsset     membership  models.ForeignKeyMembership, verbosenameMembership,         relatednamesubscriptionsset     created  models.DateTimeFieldCreated, autonowaddTrue     lastupdated  models.DateTimeFieldLast updated, autonowTrue     active  models.BooleanFieldActive, defaultTrue   class Membershipmodels.Model     name  models.CharFieldName, maxlength15     slug  models.SlugFieldSlug, maxlength15, uniqueTrue     price  models.DecimalFieldPrice, maxdigits6, decimalplaces2     recurring  models.BooleanFieldRecurring     duration  models.PositiveSmallIntegerFieldDuration months   class Contentmodels.Model     author  models.ForeignKeyAUTHUSERMODEL, verbosenameAuthor,         relatednamecontentsset     title  models.CharFieldTitle, maxlength50     slug  models.SlugFieldSlug, maxlength70, uniqueTrue     content  RichTextFieldContent     date  models.DateFieldDate, defaulttimezone.now     published  models.BooleanFieldPublished codepre

At least, I thought.p  precodefunction KatamoriGen      MapTable[4]  3       end   function love.updatedt  KatamoriGen  end codepre  pAfter that, I print the elements of the table in a matrix with 32 coloumns and 16 rows. I see here that not only the 4th element of 1st row is changed, but also the 2nd element of 2nd row and 1st element of 4th row becomes 3. p  pIt obviously means that codeTable[posXposY]code doesnt work neither since the result of the multiplication is a number like code4code and the operation would change every elements where p  pcodeX coordinate  Y coordinate  posXposYcodep  pis true. In the example code, the right side of this equation was 4.p  pA small question why is it happeningp  pThe main question is how can I identify elements of codeMapTablecode exactly How can I implement X and Y dimensions to Lua tables to use them as twodimensional arrays Maybe table of tables p  pEDIT this is the drawing functionp  precodefunction love.draw      for j1,16 do     for i1,32 do     love.graphics.drawTileset[MapTable[jMaximumX  i]], StartX  32i1, StartY  32j1     end end  end codepre  pNow its clear for me that this is wrong and the right rule is codeMapTable[jMaximumX  i]code but I get an error for it expected parameter type expected userdatap

Negative 1931 pThis question may stem from a misunderstanding of compilers on my part, but here goes...p  pOne can find the following statement in the preface to the first edition of KampR page xip  blockquote   pThe operating system, emthe C compilerem, and essentially all UNIX applications programs including all of the software used to prepare this book are written in C.p blockquote  pmy emphasisp  pHeres what I dont understand doesnt that C compiler have to be compiled itself before it can compile any C code And if that C compiler is written in C, wouldnt compiling it require an already existing C compilerp  pThe only way out of this infiniteregression conundrum or chickenandegg problem is that the C compiler written in C that KampR are referring to was actually compiled with an already existing C compiler that was written in a language other than C. The C compiler written in C then superseded the latter.p  pOr am I completely offp
Negative 1931 pSo Im trying to connect a tableView component to a UIViewController created through the .xib user interface.  I am getting the classic code[UIView tableViewnumberOfRowsInSection] unrecognized selector sent to instance 0x1f544cb0code and am guessing that I have connected something incorrectly or am doing something that I shouldnt be doing with the interface builder.  I have searched google and stack overflow and have found similar questions but non with answers that have helped my situation.  I have been hitting my head trying to figure this out and hope someone here can help.  I have only ever done this through storyboard or with .xib when the controller was a UITableViewController.  Usually I would just use a UITableViewController but I may need to add a toolbar on the bottom of the view so that option is not viable. Here are the steps I took to create the class please let me know if I am doing something wrongp  pI first create the file with an XIB for user interface img srchttpi.stack.imgur.com1rfxw.png altenter image description herep  pI then add the table view component to the XIB img srchttpi.stack.imgur.comMqavA.png altenter image description herep  pIn the LeftMenuViewController.h I add the following line of code to tell the allow for the class to be used as a UITableViewDelegate and UITableViewDataSourcep  pcodeinterface LeftMenuViewController  UIViewController ltUITableViewDataSource, UITableViewDelegategtcodep  pI then connect the table view component up to the delegate and data source by control dragging from the component to the Files Owner heading and selecting the delegate and data source as can be seenp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comf4t7Y.png altenter image description herep  pI then add the following lines of code to LeftMenuViewController.m to provide definitions for the required TableView delegate methodsp  precode NSIntegernumberOfSectionsInTableViewUITableView tableView      return 1    NSIntegertableViewUITableView tableView numberOfRowsInSectionNSIntegersection      return 5    CGFloattableViewUITableView tableView heightForRowAtIndexPathNSIndexPath indexPath      return 48    UITableViewCell tableViewUITableView tableView cellForRowAtIndexPathNSIndexPath indexPath      UITableViewCell cell     return cell  codepre  pThis process causes the app to throw a NSInvalidArgumentException which produces the code[UIViewController tableViewnumberOfRowsInSection] unrecognized selectorcode error.

Negative 1931 pI found this question somewhere on internet now facing same problem. With little change i already have modfied question below.p  pQuestionp  pstrongI want to access a file on remote machine10.10.20.30, but i couldnt understand how to login to that machine in my program. Is there any simple win api that takes network path, credentials and returns the handle of file i just want to access 10.10.20.30share foldertest.txt. Any suggestion will be helpful.strongp  psorry for not being very clear in coding sense. Detail I wanted to access a file that is shared in a shared folder but permission is not given to me. I am using bCreateFileb to get the handel of the file . But in this case i am reciveing error code 5 ACCESSDENIED. i need to use user my client credential username password to access file which is shared. I just need handle of file.Tell me if i am wrong CreateFile cannot be used in this case by using or modifying security attributes as MSDN says. CreateFile ignores the lpSecurityDescriptor member when opening an existing file.I also thought of using Window shell but could not reched a solution.p  pproblem Detail  strongWell the requirement is like this at remote machine i do not have EveryOne permission. Let me explain through an example. Suppose there is network with certain domain having atleast 3 computer lets say 5. Now there name are C1client,C2destination,C3,C4,C5. Now in this case i will create a fileany type at C2 machine and will put that in a folder say MyFolder. Now make it share and after that and remove EveryOne from it. After that add C5 as user for accessing it. Now you can see write the some code with just CreateFile implementation and run it on both machine C1client and C5it has permission. You will see clientC1 will get error 5 which means ACCESSDENIED but C5 will execute it and will get the file handle......Now again i am repeating my question i need to get the file handle by any means through my user name and password, And my program will get the handle from that C1 machine..strong p  pPlease advice me Thanks in advance p  pCreateFile Fails with Access denied is shell programming or other solution or hintp

I see that the codedaacode command exists but that only adjusts the codealcode while I need the entire codeaxcode adjusted to from hex to decimal.p  pFor Examplep  precodemov ax, 9876h mov bx, 5432h add ax, bx codepre  pwould result in ECA8 in the codeaxcode register. The answer after the conversion I want would be something like 5308 in the codeaxcode register with a carry flag specifying the one before the 5 in the full answer 15308p  pcodeDAAcode only affects codealcode instead of codeaxcode, is there some other command to do this or an easy way to do such a thing Im also looking for an idea for subtraction as well since codeDAScode also only affects codealcodep

Negative 1931 pI am not allowed to use threading so queuing only. p  pas part of our school project we have to implement a working animation which represents an elevator. I have done all the logic and animation behind it  moving up and down, opening doors, etc.. , which is controlled by buttonclick events.  e.g button1 move the elevator up button2 move the elevator down button3 open elevator doors button4 open floor doorsp  pMy problem I have is  When i click button1, the elevator will move up, however if I press button2 before button1 finished processing the event, my code will break and all hell breaks loose  what i would like to do is to have some sort of logic like thisp  pbutton1 is pressed and is added to the queue, button2 is pressed before the button1 finished so it is added to the top of the queue and waits until button1 stops processing, then runs the button2 eventp  pI was looking into the concept of queuing and I found out that is exactly what i need. However, ive tried numerous ways on how to implement this and filed every single time.p  pIt would be most appreciated if somebody could explain with an example of how to do this, where to implement it  where to actually run this code  or point me to a good reference about it.p

If I move left and right collision occurs THEN up and down collision is no longer true when I move up and down after I already collided left and right.p  pHere is my a hrefhttpjsfiddle.netbYWyh5 relnofollowJSFiddleap  pHere is a snippet of my detection and movementp  precode            if keydown  UP                  if hasCollidedpX, pY  v, mX, mY pY  v                 keydown  null              else if keydown  DOWN                  if hasCollidedpX, pY  v, mX, mY pY  v                 keydown  null              else if keydown  LEFT                  if hasCollidedpX  v, pY, mX, mY pX  v                 keydown  null              else if keydown  RIGHT                  if hasCollidedpX  v, pY, mX, mY pX  v                 keydown  null              codepre  pAny help with my logic would be much appreciated.

Negative 1931 pIm in the early stages of planning a webapp that also needs to be deployed as a desktop application using tideSDK. The latter Im not yet familiar with. Hence, my questionp  pstrongQstrong In tideSDK, can an extjs javascript created window be opened in a native window that could be moved to a second screen, for examplep  pIf so, how is that done Any pointers or links would be helpful and greatly appreciated.p  pOr would several windows in tideSDK triggered within the same application act like independant browser instances In this case, I assume, the whole extjs framework would have to be loaded againp  pThanks everyone in advancep  pThomasp

Negative 1931 pThe codeItemscode property of a checked list box control in Windows forms is of type object, so my naive hope was that I can add a customized User control as item. Since, usually, my task is to write logic for background tasks Im not too familiar with UI programming, so this may be a stupid idea..p  pMore precisely I want to display two labels and a button in each line of the the checked list box. The first label is supposed to display the name of an object the user can select so that later on a specific operation will be performed on all checked items. For any item checked, the button is supposed to allow the user to choose a file from which custom settings can be read for performing that operation and the second label should display the choice the user has made using the button i.e. the file name or something like the string default settings.p  pSo, in the forms designer, I created a custom control codeCustomControl1code with codelabel1code, codelabel2code, codebutton1code, and methods to set the text properties, set autosize of the labels and the button to false, defined their size manually. Then in the main window I created the checked list box, to which I added custom controls. The constructor of my main window now looks as followsp  precode        InitializeComponent          UserControl1 uc1  new UserControl1         uc1.setLabel1label1text         uc1.setLabel2label2text         uc1.setButtonTextbuttontext          this.checkedListBox1.Items.Adduc1          uc1.Visible  true codepre  pThis compiles without any error and also runs, but the checked list box shows an empty field. I also experimented with the size of the list box. If I reduce the height so that the check box just fits into it then I do see fragments of the button in the corresponding line, but no label. p  pIs it possible to use a custom form in a checked list box and if yes, what am I missingp

I want to keep the C code generated by MELT conforming to the C standard 03 or 98 required to compile GCC.p  h3workaroundh3  pThanks to a hrefhttpstackoverflow.coma21201894841108juanchopanzas answera Ive solved the issue by moving the declaration of codeCompareIndexcode at global scope before codemysortcode.p  psupI just committed the svn revision 206748 of the MELT branch of GCC its file codegccmeltwarmeltbase.meltcode contains now a codemultiplesortnewcode MELT function to replace codemultiplesortcode when it is working well using codestdstablesortcode, and a global codeMeltSortCompareIndexcode class in the generated C code.supp
Negative 1931 pSo Im learning dart and web development in general. Right now Im experimenting with the history API. I havep    pre classlangdart prettyprintoverridecodeimport darthtml  void main    ParagraphElement paragraph  querySelector.parag    ButtonElement buttonOne  querySelector.testaja    buttonOne.onClick.listen      window.history.pushStatenull, test title, testdata     window.history.forward       ButtonElement buttonTwo  querySelector.testlagi    buttonTwo.onClick.listen      window.history.back       window.onPopState.listen      window.alertwindow.location.pathname     codepre  pMy conclusion is that codeonPopStatecode only triggers when we click on browsers back or forward button, or using codewindow.history.forwardcode or codewindow.history.backcode. So this is like, we render a template, then change its url using codepushStatecode, not update template based on url changes. Is this true or notp  pEditp  pSo maybe Im not clear enough. Lets say I have something like thisp  pre classlangdart prettyprintoverridecodevoid main    InputElement input  querySelector.input   ButtonElement changeUrl  querySelector.changeurl    changeUrl.onClick.listenevent      window.history.pushStatenull, test tile, input.value       Map urls         showRoot,     userid  showUserProfile       window.onPopState.listen      var location  window.location.pathname      urls[location]     codepre  pI can get codeinputcodes value by clicking on codechangeUrlcode, and then by adding a listener to codechangeUrlcode, I can use codepushStatecode to update url on browser. What Im expecting is, when I do codepushStatecode, the codewindow.onPopStatecode will triggered and invoke the callback when in reality it doesnt. p  ptldr, what Im trying to achieve isp  plisten on url changes  get current url  use current url to invoke a handler stored in a map. Using codeonHashChangecode also doesnt work when updating url using codepushStatecode prefixed by codecode.p
Negative 1931 pI am using MSTest to test an application. The test requires certain specific values, which are not normally present, to appear in the application config file.p  pSo I need to substitute a wellknown config file containing the values, at test run time, so that System.Configuration.ConfigurationManager points at the right file. ie I am faking the real config file by substituting another one that I made earlierp  pI can do all that, except that by the time my test executes, System.Configuration.ConfigurationManager has already read the config file, so that the new values are ignored.p  pExample codep  precode    static TemporaryConfigFile config     [ClassInitialize]     public static void ClassInitialiseTestContext testContext              string sourceResource  IntraMatrixSchedulerTests.Resources.test.config         string tempConfigFileName  test.config         config  TemporaryConfigFile.CreateFromEmbeddedResourceAssembly.GetExecutingAssembly, sourceResource, tempConfigFileName           [ClassCleanup]     public static void ClassCleanUp              config.Dispose      codepre  pthe above code creates a new config file with known test values, and points AppDomain.CurrentDomainAPPCONFIGFILE at it. In the production code this technique of rerouting to another config file works perfectly if done at the start of the applicationp  pThe problem is that the following production line, when exercised by a test, does not retrieve the desired test valuesp  precode        var dict  System.Collections.Specialized.NameValueCollectionSystem.Configuration.ConfigurationManager.GetSectionScheduledTasks codepre  pand the reason is clearly that although the production code line and test code are by now pointing at the correct config file, the production config file has already been loaded into memory so the test config file is effectively ignored.p  pSo the question is how can System.Configuration.ConfigurationManager be forced to reread the config file, or how else can the config file be faked Alternatively how can I directly modify the inmemory config file for the duration of the test AFAIK I cant use dependency injection and MOQ to mock it, because System.Configuration.ConfigurationManager is staticp  pTIAp
Negative 1931 pI am working on a small electronics project at home using a PIC microcontroller 18F which I am programming with HiTech C18 that is going to be used for digital control of a bench power supply.p  pI have run into a problem which is that I have a floating point number in a variable lets say for example 12.34 and need to split it out into 4 variables holding each individual number so i get Char1  1, Char22 etc etc for display on a 4way seven segment LED display. The number will always be rounded to 2 decimal places so there shouldnt be a need to track the location of the decimal point.p  pI am trying to avoid any rounding where possible above 2 decimal places as the displays are giving measurements of voltagecurrent and this would affect the accuracy of the readouts.p  pAny advice on how to get this split would be greatly appreciated.p  pThanksp

Negative 1931 h2RESUMEh2  pGood day StackOverflow community.p  pIve been trying for some time to develop a program that enables users to put objects in an area, allowing this area to be moved by the mouse. For this type of program, I decided to use a ScrollPane, because the user can add various contents in the area which I call the canvas. For some reason, something strange is happening in my program.p  h2EXPLANATION OF PROGRAMh2  pWhat I basically did was create a group of objects, and define this group as the ScrollPane content. Within the group, there is a Rectangle object that was added to serve as canvas boundaries. This object has larger dimensions such as 1500 x 1000, for example, and is used in calculations that prevent nodes from moving beyond its limits. This is just the logical behind the existing large rectangle in my program, but in reality, there is no Node object with the mouse movement. What exists is the random distribution of Shape objects by the rectangle area.p  pFor ScrollPane has its scrollbars moved, I use the a hrefhttpdownload.java.netjdk8jfxdocsjavafxscenecontrolScrollPane.htmlsetHvaluedouble relnofollowsetHvaluea a hrefhttpdownload.java.netjdk8jfxdocsjavafxscenecontrolScrollPane.htmlsetVvaluedouble relnofollowsetVvaluea methods. Unfortunately for my purposes, this method does not change the position of the ScrollPanes viewport with pixel values, but values that are in a range between 0f and 1f. So I can move the viewport with the mouse, I used a equation known as Rule of 3 here in my Country, as I know, which we equate values and cross multiply.p  pFor example, say I want to move the viewport of the ScrollPane with the mouse horizontally, and that my canvas area has a width of 2000 pixels. Finding how far in pixels the mouse was dragged from one point to another, I need to know how this value represents in a range 0f to 1f. Suppose I have dragged the mouse in 3 pixels, I could find the representation of the 0f to 1f with the following comparisonp  precode2000 px  1f    3 px  xf codepre  pMultiplying crossed, Ill get the following resultp  precodexf  3  2000 xf  0.0015 codepre  blockquote   pstrongNotestrong I believe you all know that.

button on the canvas area and drag it, you can see that the program moves the ScrollPane viewport horizontally. The program seems to work perfectly or not. However, something goes wrong at the time when the mouse is dragged sometimes abruptly ...or not. At certain times the ScrollPane Viewport is not visually updated. This is a strange behavior, because even if viewport is not visually updated, the scrollbars are still updated.p  pI put other ways to move the ScrollPane viewport horizontally using the same method, and for some reason, only the approach using the mouse makes it happen. I thought this could be solved by making a request for layout using a hrefhttpdownload.java.netjdk8jfxdocsjavafxsceneParent.htmlrequestLayout relnofollowrequestLayouta, also causing a request to a pulse, but it does not work.p  h2THE TEST OUTPUTh2  pThe odd thing is that everything returns to normal when the window of my application is resized. Heres a video that shows what happens to my programp  pa hrefhttpvideobam.comIDGyf relnofollowVIDEOa amp a hrefhttptinypic.complayer.phpvsws4jq3Eamps8.UvUFzIUUFsI relnofollowMIRROR 1ap  pI no longer know what else to do. Can anyone help me with this pleasep  h2EDIT 08022014 1008 AM GMT  300h2  pThe original source code of my application is found written in Portuguese, so you may be seeing something unknown. Basically TestesUtil is a utility class with static methods that define shortcuts to other client classes. I changed the call from my source code shown here previously and am now putting some methods of my class TestesUtil, translated into English as TestsUtilp  precodepublic static void putRandomlyInNode node , double northPoint , double southPoint , double eastPoint , double westPoint      node.setLayoutXMath.random  pontoLeste     node.setLayoutYMath.random  pontoSul      fixEasternBoundarynode , eastPoint     fixNorthernBoundarynode , northPoint     fixWesternBoundarynode , westPoint     fixSouthernBoundarynode , southPoint  codepre  pThere is no mystery here. This method simply calculates a value from an interval, and defines the LayoutXY properties for the Node argument. Methods fix ... just check the boundsInParent bounds of the node compared to the point in the argument, and then adjust the layoutXYproperties from the Node object. Even if I remove the random distribution of objects, the problem still happens. So Im sure this problem is not being caused by this. p  pThe source code of the original post was changed with the addition of the ability to move the scroll bars with the arrow keys. Even if it is already an existing function of ScrollPane, adding that could reproduce the error seen with the mouse now with arrows. Some things were also translated into English for better understanding by the community.p  pPlease, I ask for help. Im getting dizzy not knowing what to do. This type of situation could be happening because of some bug in JavaFX Ahhrr... Please somebody help me in this. p  pThank you for your attention anyway.p  h2EDIT 09022014 1050 AM GMT  300h2  pForgot to mention... My program was initially written and tested using JDK 8 b123. Currently I installed the JDK 8 b128 version and am still getting the same problem. My operating system is Windows 7 64x.p  pI am almost certain that this is a bug. Are you guys getting the same result as me Or am I the only one to find this kind of problem If this is a bug, which procedure should be takenp  pThank you for your attention.p  h2EDIT 10022014 0945 AM GMT  300h2  pA bounty was started.p

Negative 1931 pAs per the title, I cant locate any dump files when this program I support is crashing.p  pThe applications logs clearly mention its a SIGSEGV exception, but I have searched my entire hard drive, and there are no .dmp files anywhere to be found.p  pThe developers of the program have seen similar issues elsewhere but have so far been unable to explain why this is happening  and were kind of a bit stuck at the moment. p  pThe last section in the application logs reads as p  precodeReceived signal SIGSEGV, segmentation violation.

And therefore no core dump is getting generated...  I did raise this idea with the developers but they never really seemed have investigated if this might be the reason.

There are hundreds of implementations of this object think POJO which all implement a common interface.p  pI created the wrapper in the first place to be able to say codepojo.propertycode since I have 23 three ways to look up properties for these in Java and that was cumbersome in Groovy scripts.

But now, I need to call methods with this wrapper. The methods, of course, are implemented in Java and have no idea that Groovy exists or that there might be a wrapper.

Negative 1931 pI have a collectionview with a an index view a custom one since the apple one works only with UITableViews, this index view which is an UIControl subclass that calls a method when the value changed event is fired.

Negative 1931 pI have a table view controller with an associated tableView.  The cells in this list also contain tableViews, or more specifically, the cell has a tableView and each instance of the cell is using the embedded tableView to display a slightly different list of names.  Here is a diagramp  ol liparent tableView li litableViewCellli liembedded tableView li liname1 in a cellli liname2         li liname3     li ol  pThere is no view controller for the embedded tableView.  The delegate and the dataSource are both mapped to the embedded tableView class.  This is all storyboard based.p  pOn the simulator, this setup works nicely for the first few cells displayed in the list  each is displaying its own list of names  but after the fourth or fifth cell yes, I have scrolled offthescreen several times over, the cells still display but they are not being generated by the embedded table view they have old and incorrect lists of names.  At that point, there are calls to neither awakeFromNib nor initWithCoder for the embedded tableView both of which are called for the successfully displayed cells.p  pThat implies to me that the parent tableView the one that owns the cells that have the embedded tableViews is reusing cells that it is pulling off the reuse list.  This brings up some questionsp  ol lipWhy isnt it trying to rebuild the cells  In the parent tableViews tableViewcellForRowAtIndexPath, I get a cell and fill it with some information there is for example, also a UILabel in the cell so I can identify it and new content for that works, but the embedded tableView part of the cell is NOT rebuilt.pli lipIf this is a case of reused cells being plucked from some cache, how I can mark each cached item as dirty so it gets rebuilt  I am aware of tableViewdidEndDisplayingCellforRowAtIndexPath but I dont know how to use it to accomplish a rebuild.  For example, I tried to delete the cell i.e., cell  nil, but that didnt help I did this on both the parent tableView and the embedded tableView.pli lipIn the discussion of prepareForReuse which I didnt try since I want to change more than attributes, it says, The table views delegate in tableViewcellForRowAtIndexPath should always reset all content when reusing a cell. If the cell object does not have an associated reuse identifier, this method is not called. If you override this method, you must be sure to invoke the superclass implementation.  That is exactly what Im trying to do, but the embedded tableView is somehow escaping this harkening back to neither awakeFromNib nor initWithCoder being called.pli ol  pThank you.p

Negative 1931 pI have some doubt regarding the yield method in java. Because when we are using it like Thread.yield then the thread goes to the runnable state and give chance to the other thread to run but the thread which call yield is not releasing the lock. So , only threads except those who are waiting for the lock to release will run . So , when and in which scenario this yield method is useful.p

I cant use C and I havent been able to use real time debugging since I dont have JTAG or some other debugging supported interface.

Negative 1931 pIve got a windows service calling a WCF web service using netMsmqBinding with the queueTransferProtocol set to Srmp.p  pAll of this works great, except for when the application pool hosting the web service gets restarted or recycled.  p  pThe only way to get messages to send is by manually browsing to the URL, or using some http ping utility.  Once the URL is activated the WCF web service starts to consume the incoming queue.p  pI had this problem before switching to Srmp, and I resolved it by installing the WCF Activation feature on the web server and naming the queue appropriately.p  pIve been forced to use Srmp due to firewall restrictions so port 80 or 443 are my only options.p  pThere is a workaround here where I could set up a scheduled task to call each web service on schedule, but I would prefer a simpler more robust solution.p  pA full solution would be really nice, but Im open to considering some other workarounds.p

Negative 1931 pI have created a custom assembly in c which is going to be used by a number of different existing systems, there is quite a lot of configuration involved in getting this assembly working with our systems so to make things easier, we decided to create a local NuGet Server and roll the assembly into a NuGet package.p  pThis worked perfectly well and we were able to add all the dependencies the assembly requires and add a web.config.transform file to merge in any additional nodes required.p  pThis is where we hit our first stumbling block...p  pFirstly as I mentioned previously the assembly is written in c, the application we are test running is written in VB.Net. As we are using codelog4netcode in the assembly we have implemented codeWebActivatorExcode to ensure this was initialised on application startup, meaning we have an codeAppStartcode class which sits codeAppStartcode folder. However, after referring to the codeWebActivatorExcode documentation we noticed that if the project is a strongwebsitestrong as apposed to a strongweb applicationstrong the codeAppStartcode class must sit inside the codeAppCodecode folder not the codeAppStartcode folder and must also use the codePostApplicationStartMethodcode and not the codePreApplicationStartMethodcode.p  pAlso as the codeAppStartcode class is written in c and will sit inside a VB.Net project we need this converting to VB only if the target project is VB to avoid messing around with more configuration files which is something we are trying to minimise.p  pIn short, strongthe main questions herestrong arep  p1. Can our NuGet package have some sort of strongconditional behaviourstrong, i.e. if its a VB.Net project add the codeAppStartcode class in VB.Net and if its C, leave it as C.p  p2. If the project is a website place this codeAppStartcode class in the codeAppCodecode folder and use the codePostApplicationStartMethodcode, if the project is a web application place the codeAppStartcode class in the codeAppStartcode folder and use the codePreApplicationStartMethodcode.p  p3. Is this even the correct approach in terms of initialising log4net without rewriting the target applications global.asaxp  p4. Im aware you can run PowerShell commands inside the NuGet package, is there anyway of using this to work out whether the project is C  VB or am I complicating things and should I simply create 4 different NuGet packages for each and every scenario but this seems plain wrong.p  pI will await and welcome any suggestions or comments.p
Negative 1931 pAs far as I understand, the codebase for RMI which I set on the client, will be passed to the server.

Negative 1931 pI have a strange heisenbug which appears in x86 Release mode under VC11 C.  Unfortunately I wasnt able to come up with a minimal example which still has the bug, however here is one that works finep  precodeinclude stdafx.h  lt nothing special in here include ltvectorgt  class MyClass      stdvectorltdoublegt myVec public     void initint m          myVec  stdvectorltdoublegtm  3        int tmainint argc, TCHAR argv[]      MyClass x  1     x.init1  2  codepre  pNow in 1 I create a an instance of MyClass where myVec should be default constructed as empty vector.  In 2 I call init which changes the value of myVec, see 3.  There I get somethimes an error.p  pThe error is always an heap error during deallocation of the original content of myVec.  It seems like myVec does not contain any memory but it tries to free it anyway.  However, the error occours only in Release mode, not always like in 80 of the cases, despite the fact that the algorithm runs always on the same data and has no random elements, and it occours never while stepping through the program with the debugger it is actually enough to have a break point in this line and always press F5 to continue.p  pI could fix the problem by usingp  precode    myVec.resize0     myVec.resizem codepre  pinstead of 3.  But what I now fear is that I still have a bug somewhere in my program that caused undefined behaviour and for that reason myVec was not properly constructed or at least somehow came in inproper state.  I have just no clue how such a bug could look like and where to start looking for it.p  pHas anyone have had some similar problem before and an idea how to systematically find the cause of error  I know its hard to make a remote diagnostics in this case but any help would be appreciated.p  pstrongUpdatestrongp  pI installed Application Verifier and during this found out how to use WinDbg from Visual Studio  really cool to have a debugger one can talk to  .  Unfortunately it only told me that I try to release memory at a place where no memory is allocated at the moment and that the address where this happens changes from run to run.  But I couldnt find out why this happens.p  pI then started to carefully review my code and by the way did a refartoring of the project.  When I was done the error did not appear anymore.  I didnt change the algorithms only reorganized them a little bit.  I let a coworker view over the parts I changed and he couldnt see a mistake either, neither in the refactored version nor in the original version.p  pThen I rolled my source code back to the version before the refactoring and the error was gone there, too.  Im really confused about this  Ive only my source checked in and no binaries and object files.  Right now, my two best guesses arebr  either the error is still there just randomly now without symtomsbr  or there went something wrong during building, maybe involving some issues with external libraries, what for some reason does not happen anymore.p  pI will now go on working on my project and hope either the error appears again and I can finde the cause or it will keep silent for ever and ever.p

However, the only reason I had placed the gridView in a linear layout in the first place was in attempt to just not have the button disappear when having its androidlayoutbelow property to the gridView by setting its androidlayoutbelow to something else. The more accurate fix for what I wanted to do however, was to not have the gridViews width and height set to matchparent, which was the root cause behind why the button was disappearing. So, i set the gridViews height to wrap content, but that caused the grid to shrink to the point where each grid elements content was no longer visible. I found that the cause of that was  I was programmatically setting the width and height of the gridview to wrap its content, and then the width and height of the components inside by the width and height of the parent view. Realized that was quite cyclical which may be why the gridview was shrinking when I set it to wrap content. I then set the width and height of the grid Elements based on the dimensions of the screen, which fixed the size of the gridView. So everything pretty much works now. p  pHere is my new layout, if anyone is interested. p  precodeltRelativeLayout xmlnsandroidhttpschemas.android.comapkresandroid     xmlnstoolshttpschemas.android.comtools     androidlayoutwidthmatchparent     androidlayoutheightmatchparent     androidorientationvertical     androidpaddingBottomdimenactivityverticalmargin     androidpaddingLeftdimenactivityhorizontalmargin     androidpaddingRightdimenactivityhorizontalmargin     androidpaddingTopdimenactivityverticalmargin     androidbackgrounddrawablepinfragmentbackground     toolscontextcom.lab125.vivaapp.MainActivityPlaceholderFragment gt       ltTextView         androidididsectionlabel         androidlayoutwidthwrapcontent         androidlayoutheightwrapcontent      gt      ltTextView         androidididaudioPINmarquee         androidlayoutwidthmatchparent         androidlayoutheightwrapcontent         androidlayoutmarginTop5dp         androidlayoutmarginBottom20dp         androidpaddingTop15dp         androidgravitycenter         androidtextSize15sp         androidtextStylebold     gt      ltGridView         androidididkeypad         androidlayoutwidthmatchparent         androidlayoutheightwrapcontent         androidlayoutbelowidaudioPINmarquee         androidlayoutmarginTop10dp         androidlayoutmarginBottom20dp         androidcolumnWidth90dp         androidgravitycenter         androidhorizontalSpacing5dip         androidverticalSpacing5dip         androidnumColumns3         androidstretchModecolumnWidth gt       ltButton          androidididstartverbtn         androidlayoutwidthmatchparent         androidlayoutheightwrapcontent         androidlayoutbelowidkeypad         androidlayoutalignParentBottomtrue         androidlayoutmarginTop20dp         androidtextSize15sp         androidtextStylebold         androidtextstringStartVerButton         androidbackgrounddrawablebuttonstyle gt      lt     ltButton         androidididaudioplaybackbtn         androidlayoutcenterHorizontaltrue         androidlayoutwidthwrapcontent         androidlayoutheightwrapcontent         androidlayoutbelowidkeypadwrapper         androidtextplay         androidtextSize15spgt     ltButtongt gt   ltRelativeLayoutgt codepre

Negative 1931 pI am relatively new in optimizationa nd I am trying to optimize a problem from a pas class in Coursera, 2 years ago about Warehouse Location. The problem is, its been more than 6 hours and its still running on an instance with 100 warehouses and 1000 customers.p  pThe problem is the following. I have a set of warehouses that I can either open or not. Opening each of them has a cost sw. Also, they all have a maximum capcity, capw. On the other side, there is a bunch of clients, all of them have to be connected to one and only one open warehouse. Each of them has a demand dc and for each of the clients, there is a transportation cost from each warehouse twc. What I want, is obviouly, to minimize the total cost.p  pSo, I have an array of size equal to the total number of warehouses called x. Each x[w] is a integer 0,1 defining if warehouse w is open or not. I also have a matrix of 0s and 1s defining which warehouse delivers each customer. there is, therefore as many rows as customers and as many columns as warehouses. The matrix is called y. y[c][w] is 1 if waregouse w delivers customer c, 0 otherwise.p  pSo far so good. This is supossed to be an MIP problem.  To code it, I do it un Python using the PuPL liba hrefhttpspythonhosted.orgPuLPpulp.html relnofollowhttpspythonhosted.orgPuLPpulp.htmla and the GLPK to solve it.p  pNow, here is my modelp  precodeusrbinpython   coding utf8   from pulp import   def solveItinputData   parse the input lines  inputData.splitn  parts  lines[0].split warehouseCount  intparts[0] customerCount  intparts[1]  warehouses  [] for i in range1, warehouseCount1     line  lines[i]     parts  line.split     warehouses.appendintparts[0], floatparts[1]  customerDemands  [] customerCosts  []  lineIndex  warehouseCount1 for i in range0, customerCount     customerDemand  intlines[lineIndex2i]     customerCost  mapfloat, lines[lineIndex2i1].split     customerDemands.appendcustomerDemand     customerCosts.appendcustomerCost    x  [LpVariablexstrw,0,1,catInteger for w in range0,warehouseCount] y  [[LpVariableystrc,strw,0,1,catInteger for w in range0,warehouseCount] for c in range0,customerCount]  prob  LpProblemWarehouse Location,LpMinimize  Constraints  ycw lt xw makes sure that no client is delivered by a closed warehouse for w in range0,warehouseCount     for c in range0,customerCount         prob  y[c][w] lt x[w]  A client is served by exactly one warehouse for c in range0,customerCount     affineExpression  []     for w in range0,warehouseCount         affineExpression.appendy[c][w],1     prob  LpAffineExpressionaffineExpression  1  For each warehouse, the sum of demand of all the clients it serves is lower than its capacity for w in range0,warehouseCount     affineExpression  []     for c in range0,customerCount         affineExpression.appendy[c][w],customerDemands[c]     prob  LpAffineExpressionaffineExpression lt warehouses[w][0]  Objective The sum of all the warehouses opening plus the transportation costs has to be minimal affineExpression  [] for w in range0,warehouseCount     affineExpression.appendx[w],warehouses[w][1]     for c in range0,customerCount         affineExpression.appendy[c][w],customerCosts[c][w]  prob  LpAffineExpressionaffineExpression  print START SOLVING status  prob.solveGLPKmip1,msg  1 print LpStatus[status] for w in range0,warehouseCount     print valuex[w]  solution  [] for c in range0,customerCount     string       whichOne  1     for w in range0,warehouseCount         string  strvaluey[c][w]            if valuey[c][w]  1             whichOne  w             solution.appendw     print string    strwhichOne    calculate the cost of the solution obj  sum[warehouses[x][1]x[w] for x in range0,warehouseCount] for c in range0, customerCount     obj  customerCosts[c][solution[c]]   prepare the solution in the specified output format outputData  strobj     str0  n outputData   .joinmapstr, solution  return outputData codepre  pI know the way I build the matrix is not optimal, but it really isnt taking too long.

Negative 1931 pSo I have finished my codeRails APIcode and the testing of it using codeRSpeccode and codeFactoryGirlcode. This API is made to store incoming files in a codePostgreSQLcode database and it does not have any views, only models and controllers. Now I want to see it working so I will start it and I want to send a few example files to see how it truly behaves with real data.p  pHow can I achieve this I mean, simulate real incoming data and test the codeCreatecode, codeUpdatecode, etc. actions. Ive been looking for a while and I really have no idea where to start from so any clue would be nice.p  pNOTE To help you understand what I mean, if I had a normal codeRailscode project, I would use the new.html.rb page to codecreatecode a new record, the edit.html.rb to codeupdatecode an existing one, etc. This is what I would like to work with, but with no html formspages, just a couple of files that I want to load into the database and play with my codeAPIcode in development mode before it goes to Production. p

Negative 1931 pI have a .NET4 C application with some GUI. It works with serial network devices via USBUART converter FT2232. The converter implemets a hub with several USB, which are shown as a number of COMxx in the system.p  pI supported a dynamic port addremove operation over WMI so as ports would refresh in UI automatically when pluggedunplugged.p  pPlugin operation works fine, i.e. ports become visible in a second or two after insertion. But unpluging is the issue when unplugged not all hubs ports disappear, but only one or two out of four by this time all ports are not in use, closed. The issue is valid for WinXP x86 and Win7 x64.p  pSome investigation showed that it does not help to refresh port list calling SerialPort.GetPortNames after awhile or by timer. The list stays stale. BUT if I close the window with ports it is not the main window and reopen it again, one phantom port disappears, then again and all phantom ports are gonep  pHas anybody run into similar situations or have some ideasp  pMay it be somehow connected with that I call GetPortNames from UI contextp  pOr this is rather HW driver issuep

Negative 1931 pI am trying to map a class which looks likep  precodepublic class Skills      private int[] levels  10 elements  codepre  pNow, mapping an array in Hibernate is a big pain and as I had no luck at all doing that before, I am trying a different approach. Each and every of the 10 elements, actually represents a skill itself. Think of it as ATK, STR, DEX, INT, et cetera. Due to a few design restrictions, it has to be used as an array, otherwise Id simply add 10 fields to it, of course. p  pThe real pain is in mapping that in SQL to make more sense. Sure, Hibernate can do Serialization of the class but that drills bytes into columns.

Negative 1931 pIm trying to use a hrefhttpwww.jacklmoore.comcolorbox relnofollowcolorboxa to show some videos within an html page, the html file and all resources, including the videos, will be on a USB drive and the user will open the html file. The idea is that when a link is pressed on the page, a colorbox will pop up and show just the video, with the background around the video being white. This works well in Firefox, it resizes the video to about 80 of the windows width and the background around is white, however in Chrome the video shows at the size of the original video file and the whole area that its supposed to occupy after being resized is black just the iframe got resized, but the video wont go bigger than the video file dimensions. I could live with this but I cant seem to get the black iframe background to match my white cboxOverlay.p  pUsing developer tools it seems like this is a problem with the user agent stylesheets, I see a few rules that could be causing the problem but somehow Im not managing to override them with reset.css or regular css filesp  precodevideowebkitfullpagemedia  maxheight 100 maxwidth 100  bodywebkitfullpagemedia  backgroundcolor rgb0, 0, 0 codepre  pAny insight would be much appreciated.p

First when printing to an XPS I run into an out of memory after waiting for a while, and the other is that when I try to print to a physical printer it prints in a repeating fashion page 1, 1, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 4.... So my hypothesis is that the function we are using to chop the pages is not effectively cutting the pages and has some extra baggage that causes the memory problem.p  pstrongNotestrong This whole process works fine in the DocumentViewer all the pages are in order and no duplicates so I am not sure where the difference is between that and the XPS or printer.p  pIve tried printing single pages, just one page added to the itemsControl which worked fine, just printed 1 page. p  pThe XPS printing will save an XPS file that is normal, all pages in order, it is just taking a while to complete the process, or if there are too many files it will crash with the out of memory.p  pThe printing will do the odd ordering when there is a certain amount of pages added, like printing 3 pages was fine but 11 broke, even when XPS is fine, so that is were I am confused.p  pSo general summary 1 codeDocumentViewercode always works as intended 2 XPS works if it doesnt run out of memory 3 Printing works if the codeItemsControlcodehas less than 3 itemsp

Negative 1931 pI need to take a pipe that has a column of labels with associated values, and pivot that pipe so that there is a column for each label with the correct values in each column.  So f example if I have thisp  precodeId  Label Value  1   Red   5 1   Blue  6 2   Red   7 2   Blue  8 3   Red   9 3   Blue  10 codepre  pI need to turn it into thisp  precodeID Red Blue 1  5   6 2  7   8 3  9   10 codepre  pI know how to do this using the pivot command, but I have to explicitly know the values of the labels.  How can I can dynamically read the labels from the label column into a list that I can then pass into the pivot command  I have tried to create list withp  precodepipe.groupByid .toListlabel  codepre  p, but I get a type mismatch saying it found a symbol but is expecting cascading.tuple.Fields, cascading.tuple.Fields.  Also, from reading online, it sounds like using toList is frowned upon.  The number of things in label is finite and not that big 3050 items maybe, but may be different depending on what sample of data I am working with.p  pAny suggestions you have would be great.  Thanks very muchp

Negative 1931 pThis question is extremely specific. I have found dozens of places telling you how to generate random permutations in Java, but it never got as far as calculating the probability of the Chi Square Distribution. Let me tell you that setting it up seemed fair enough, with many tutorials online, but one thing about this code that has really nagged me was the fact that in the second part of the assignment, Im supposed to generate a random permutation of a string from index j where j is chosen randomly between the range of 0 and i. One method is supposed to output a probability of 1.0 all the time, which is biased and unfair, while the second method generates a probability of any number between 0 and 1.0. Ive got the first part of that in part 1, but the second part I am having trouble making it not display 1.0 all the time. The assignment says that i simply steps through the array.

Negative 1931 pI have an existing class that extends a Number amp implements Comparable, and I have been using this class extensively  including in my test classes Junit amp Spock. I have also been comparing instances of this class using  operator in the test classes.p  pAs I understand it, Groovy will not use .equals for comparison of classes which implements Comparable. Furthermore, after trawling Groovy code, I also found out that my class will be compared using Integer hence losing decimal points, etc  as it is not Floating point, BigDecimal, BigInteger, Long. i.e. Integer is the fallback.p  pTo overcome this problem, I tried to do metaclass programming on Groovys NumberMath class.p  precodeclass Test2       Test     void blah         NumberMath.metaClass.static.compareTo    Number left, Number right gt             println 982374             return 123                  def num1  new Decimal9.01         def num2  new Decimal9.02           this prints 982374         println NumberMath.compareTonum1, num2           this doesnt print 982374         num1  num2         codepre  pBut this doesnt seem to work as shown in the snippet above. The  operator doesnt call the compareTo method which I have provided in the test. Have I missed something herep  pThanks in advancep  pRegards,p  pAlexp

Negative 1931 pI am currently writing a TCP IO facility that uses Boost.Asio as the underlying socket API, and Ive noticed that strongBoost.Asio seems to lack documentation on which specific Boost error codesconditions can result from each individual operationstrong e.g. functionmethod call or asynchronous operation. All that Ive been able to find is the error code API and some informal error code lists, strongnone of which correlate specific codes to specific operationsstrong.p  pThis apparent lack of documentation is frustrating, because its difficult to write robust code when you dont know the possible failure modes. Its impossible to even give examples, since Im not even confident of which issues could arise from which operations due to the lack of documentation.p  pIn comparison, the POSIX socket API is pretty decent at documenting failure modes. In particular, it lists errno and return values that can be generated by each function call.p  pDoes this Boost.Asio documentation exist somewhere, and Im just not seeing it Or am I supposed to just guess at, reverse engineer, or collect empirical data on the failure modes of various parts of the Boost.Asio API in order to be able to write robust code that uses itp

Negative 1931 pI occasionally receive an OOM error when using a google Map View in a fragment in my View Pager.  I have done some research and this seems to be a problem more on Googles side. Such as this posting a hrefhttpscode.google.compgmapsapiissuesissuesdetailid7187 relnofollowhttpscode.google.compgmapsapiissuesissuesdetailid7187a I was wondering if anyone might suggest something to help alleviate this issue. It is hard to replicate but it happens when reloading the parent activity of the view pager, that contains the map view. I would prefer not to designate a large heap as well, since I have seen that does not always solve this problem. Also my primary test Device is an ATT S5 SMG900A. I have not yet been able to replicate it on other devices, which is where this stack trace is from. I have also tested on a 11 in a limited fashion and have not received this error.  I also plan to test it on an S3 when it is available.

Negative 1931 pI know how to adjust the adapter binding order in Windows so that LAN is preferred over wireless, and remote access connections are preferred over either.
