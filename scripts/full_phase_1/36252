Positive 36252 pIve got an existing WinForms application on .NET 4.0 CP framework and I want it to do computations on CUDA devices. For this I decided to use a hrefhttpscudafy.codeplex.com relnofollowCUDAfy.NETa wrapper around CC Toolkit, because it is as far as I know the only one uptodate with CUDA SDK. The development is going without any major problems on my machine, but Ive encountered troubles when deploying to another device.p  pMore specifically, when I build the project in VS and then run it on my machine, it runs fine. But the odd thing is that it runs nvcc.exe when initializing CUDAfy modules, which is a part of CUDA SDK and shouldnt be required there. And when I try to run the binary on any target machine it throws this exceptionp  blockquote   pCannot find compiler cl.exe in path.p blockquote  pThis is an error connected to missing VS tool for C compiler, and it shoulnt arise on target devices. And now comes the weirdest thing when I build the sample project that comes with CUDAfy.NET and try to run it on the target device, it throws the same exception.p  pThere is nothing wrong with the target machine, according to CUDAfy.NET test app emCudafy Viewerem it is compatible and it has CUDA capability. Besides Ive tested it on several different devices, always with the same result. Ive traced the origin of the exception and as I indicated it is thrown when initializing CUDAfy.NETp  precodeCudafyModule module  CudafyTranslator.Cudafy GPGPU gpu  CudafyHost.GetDeviceeGPUType.Cuda gpu.LoadModulemodule codepre  pAccording to a hrefhttpwww.hybriddsp.comcudafyCUDAfyUserManual122.pdf relnofollowCUDAfy.NET User Manuala it should run perfectly fine on devices that meet these requirementsp  ul liWindows 64bitli li.NET 4.0li liNVIDIA GPU with compute capability 2.0 or higherli liUp to date NVIDIA driversli liCURAND, CUSPARSE, CUFFT and CUBLAS dlls if using these math librariesli liPrecompiled CUDAfy modulesli ul  pAll of these are satisfied but it still doesnt run. That leaves me with a problem on my side and Im pretty stuck there. p  pOne of the possibilities is that it is caused by wrong compilation of the code that is intended to be cudafied. According to the manual, and I quote, emYou generally would not cudafy your .NET code in a deployment situation as this requires the full CUDA SDK and Visual Studio. CUDAfy modules can be loose at .cdfy files or embedded in your application assembly .exe or .dll through use of the cudaycl command line tool.em. This should be done automatically, nonetheless Ive tried using the cudaycl, ufortunatelly with no improvement. But since the exception occurs when initializing the CUDAfy, I think that source of the problem is elsewhere.p  pWhat else might be causing it is that I build the binary for a specific architecture e.g. CUDA 2.0 and then deploying it to another e.g. CUDA 3.0. Something about it is mentioned in a hrefhttpdocs.nvidia.comcudacudacprogrammingguide relnofollowCUDA Toolkit Documentationa in the section about nvcc compiler emBinary code is architecturespecific. A cubin object is generated using the compiler option code that specifies the targeted architecture For example, compiling with codesm35 produces binary code for devices of compute capability 3.5.em.p  pOne way or another, I cant make it work right now. I would appreciate any help and suggestions you have. By the way Im using latest CUDAfy.NET v1.29 and CUDA Toolkit 7.0 the latest is not yet supported by CUDAfy.NET.p
Positive 36252 pstrongBackgroundstrongp  pI have a codeWinform applicationcode codeVB.NETcode framework 4.0. Within the application are two forms frmHome startup form and frmdePDF secondary form with an codeAdobe PDF Readercode codeCOMcode control. frmHome grabs a PDF pathway from DFS, checks if the pathway actually exists, and if so, loads the file into my PDF control and shows frmdePDF.

I have created a custom codeUITypeEditorcode to implement the input of data to my custom control via a custom form. However I am running into strange behaviour when I use the former. The strange behaviour is layout based  my custom form is larger, its minimum size is larger, and some of my form controls are initially displayed offscreen although form resize will call a scale function and partially fix this  controls end up closer together and bunched up however at least fit on the screen. When using the latter I experience none of these issues.p  pI am aware that I have managed to get the desired effect, however I want to understand why it works. Additionally if there is a better way to display a custom form for a custom control I am open to suggestions.p  pEDIT This problem with the custom form only occurs when my custom control is imported to a new project and then accessed via the properties menu. When debugging the control itself the problem is not present...p  pSee code belowp  precodeinternal class DictionaryEditor  UITypeEditor      private Form1 frm       ltsummarygt            ltsummarygt     public DictionaryEditor          base              frm  new Form1            ltsummarygt            ltsummarygt      ltparam namecontextgtltparamgt      ltparam nameprovidergtltparamgt      ltparam namevaluegtltparamgt      ltreturnsgtltreturnsgt     public override object EditValueSystem.ComponentModel.ITypeDescriptorContext context, IServiceProvider provider, object value              IWindowsFormsEditorService editorService          if provider  null                      editorService  provider.GetServicetypeofIWindowsFormsEditorService as IWindowsFormsEditorService              if editorService  null                              editorService.ShowDialogfrm                 frm.ShowDialog                 value  frm.DataSource                                return value            ltsummarygt            ltsummarygt      ltparam namecontextgtltparamgt      ltreturnsgtltreturnsgt     public override UITypeEditorEditStyle GetEditStyleSystem.ComponentModel.ITypeDescriptorContext context              return UITypeEditorEditStyle.Modal       codepre  pOn variablep  precode    [CategoryData]     [DescriptionIndicates the dictionary that this control will use to get its items.]     [EditortypeofDictionaryEditor, typeofUITypeEditor]     [Browsabletrue]     public Dictionaryltobject, objectgt DataSource              set  dicDatasource  value          get  return dicDatasource       codepre  pEDIT2 The form displays correctly in three of the four modes ive suggested. In debug mode of the control regardless of which ShowDialog is used the form displays correctly. When the control is imported into a project, the form displays correctly when Form.ShowDialog variant is used. When IWindowsFormsEditorService.ShowDialog variant is used the form does not display correclty. As far as I can tell it is this single line that is proving to effect the display. There is very little on the web about any differences between the two variants of ShowDialog. The information about IWindowsFormsEditorService indicates that it calls the Form.Showdialog variant from its input parameter. I dont see why they should behave differently.

Positive 36252 pI have a little problem with combobox databinding. I have a form that has one combobox and based on the selection in the ComboBox the form should be filled with data. I use the SelectedIndexChanged event instead of SelectionChangeCommitted because I want to be able to fill the form with the data of the first item in the  ComboBox when the form loads. I have tried 2 solutions  p  ol liAdd the event handler before Data Binding.  li ol  pThis solution almost works as it should. It selects the first ComboBox item and fills the form with relevant data but for some reason this event fires three times when binding data and this makes the form loading slow because some data gets called from a database and basically this data is being loaded 3 times.p  ol start2 liAdd the event handler after Data Binding.  li ol  pThis solution doesnt work like Id want to because it doesnt fill the form with the relevant data although the first item is correctly selected in the ComboBox after form load. This is mainly because I add the event handler fills the form with data after the Data Binding is done. The good thing about this solution is that the event is not being fired 3 times in a row, but thats the only good thing about this solution because the form is not being filled with relevant data like intended.  p  pDoes anyone have any idea why this event is getting fired 3 times As a possible way to fix the problem I could call the method, that should be fired by the event, after Data Binding and then add event handler to the ComboBox, but this looks like a hackish way of doing things. If someone can provide a better way to get things done Id be really happy. However, if my solution happens to be the onlybest way of doing things, then can someone maybe tell me technical reasons for the event firing multiple times during Data Binding  p  pEDIT I guess I found the reason and solution already. The reason the event got fired 3 times wasnt that data binding fired it 3 times  it was because assigning DisplayMember and ValueMember fired this event too.p  pBefore  p  precodecombo.SelectedIndexChanged  new System.EventHandlerthis.comboSelectedIndexChanged combo.DataSource  getItems.ToList   combo.ValueMember  Key   combo.DisplayMember  Value   codepre  pAfter  p  precodecombo.ValueMember  Key combo.DisplayMember  Value   combo.SelectedIndexChanged  new System.EventHandlerthis.comboSelectedIndexChanged combo.DataSource  getItems.ToList codepre

Positive 36252 pSo we have an application that is quite large in size and takes up an average of 75,000kb of memory when it runs this goes up and back down when opening other windows but not by much. p  pRecently, we have had a few calls into our support team about the Red Cross Of Doom as it is affectionately called. p  pThis appears on controls that are standard WinForms controls with no customization whatsoever they are also not placed in any custom containers.p  pAfter some research, we found that it seems to only trigger if an exception has occurred in a paint event assigned to that control. However, these controls have no events for painting which means that it must be underlying.p  pOur thought process is that this may be happening on systems with very low memory but that is a bit of a stab in the dark. Backing up this theory is the fact that this issue is intermittent.p  pstrongBIG RED CROSS OF DOOM on a datagridviewstrongp  pa hrefhttpi.stack.imgur.comzytOS.png relnofollowimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comzytOS.png altBig Red Cross Of Doom DGVap  pstrongBIG RED CROSS OF DOOM everywherestrongp  pa hrefhttpi.stack.imgur.com9KZ4g.png relnofollowimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.com9KZ4g.png altBig Red Cross Of Doom Everywhereap  pThe question is simply to either confirm our suspicions about the memory issue, or give us another reason, and hopefully a way to get round it.p  pNOTE br I know WinForms is a little old now and not really supported but this application is very big and therefore suggestions on converting to WPF or anything else will not be possible.p

Positive 36252 pI have a menu item on my main menu called Active Reports. when the user selects a report to print, i fire the crystal reports viewer off in a  separate thread. The user could have multiple report viewers open and i want to track them. Mainly this menu list will allow the user to click on the reports and if the report is running too long while it is processing the data for the report, i can fire off an interrupt on that thread to cancel the running report. As each report viewer is closed down, i will remove it from menu list. I have a class called ReportThreadClass which tracks each report that is currently running and the thread it belongs to. After i fire the report off in the thread, i want to update the Active Reports menu item and add the name of the report being run to the list of Active Reports.

Negative 36252 pI have a bunch of old classic ASP pages, many of which show database data in tables.  None of the pages have any sorting functionality built in you are at the mercy of whatever ORDER BY clause the original developer saw fit to use.p  pIm working on a quick fix to tack on sorting via clientside javascript.  I have a script already written that mostly does what I need.  However, I still need to add one bit of functionality.  The table rows in these pages will often have alternating row colors, and the mechanism used to achieve this varies among the pages.  It might be as simple as changing a CSS class or the styles may have been rendered inline by the ASP code.p  pRight now after sorting the table each row keeps the coloring scheme is was rendered with and so the alternating rows no longer alternate.  I was hoping to fix it with something simple like thisp  precode table is a var for the table element Im sorting.    Ive already verified it exists, and that there are at least three rows.    At this point the first row index 0 is always the header row.     check for alternating row styles var RowStyle  table.rows[1].style var AltStyle  table.rows[2].style   SORT HAPPENS HERE   snip     Apply alternating row styles if RowStyle  AltStyle return true  for var i1,iltable.rows.lengthiltili1      if i20 table.rows[i].styleRowStyle     else table.rows[i].styleAltStyle                   codepre  pUnfortunately, you cant just set to an elements style property like this.  It complains that the object has no setter.  How else can I do this simply  No frameworks like jQuery allowed here thats out of my hands.p  pstrongUpdatestrongbr While it would be the best solution, its just not practical to refactor 100 pages to all use classes rather than inline style.  Also, sometimes theres more involved than just the background color.  For example, a row may be much darker or lighter than the alternating row, with one style having a different foreground color as well to accommodate.  Or an alternating style may set borders differently.  I really dont know what is used on all of these pages, so I need something that will generically apply emallem styles from one row to another.p
Negative 36252 pIn my database schema I have an entity that is identified. The identifier can be reused and thus there is a onetomany relation with the entity. Example A person can have a nickname. Nicknames are not unique and can be shared amongst many people. So the schema might look likep  precodePERSON id name nicknameid  NICKNAME id name codepre  pThe issue is that when inserting a new person, I have to first query codeNICKNAMEcode to see if the nickname exists. If it doesnt then I have to create a row in codeNICKNAMEcode. When inserting many persons, this can be slow as each person insertion results in a query to codeNICKNAMEcode.p  pI could optimize large insertions by first querying Nickname for all the nicknames. JPA query languagep  precodeSELECT n FROM NICKNAME n WHERE name in Krusty, Doppy, Flash, etc codepre  pAnd then create the new nicknames as necessary, followed by setting nicknameid on the persons.p  pThis complicates the software a bit as it has to temporarily store nicknames in memory. Furthermore, some databases have a limit on the parameters of the codeINcode clause SQL Server is 2100 or so so I have perform multiple queries.p  pIm curious how this issue is dealt with by others. More specifically, when a database is normalized and an entity has a relationship with another, inserting a new entity basically results in having to check the other entity. For large inserts this can be slow unless the operation is lifted into the code domain. Is there someway to auto insert the related table rowsp  pFYI Im using Hibernates implementation of JPAp

Negative 36252 pWhere I work it is a requirement for us to go through stored procedures as a mechanism to access our data through code.  I am using LINQ2SQL to minimize this pain so that I can work with objects instead of ADO.NET directly.  I have a situation Linq2SQL is consuming one of my stored procedures an generating code where the return type from the stored proc call is an int.  The stored procedure actually returns a dataset.  After doing a little research I have found that this is because the SQLClient library can not properly parse the sproc to generate the expected metadata that Linq2SQL uses to create the object graph.  My question is how can sprocs even complex ones be structured so that you get an object graph out of linq2sql, or in other words what should you avoid having in your stored procedure that will create confusion for the SQLClient library to not understand how to generate the metadata that linq2sql consumes in order to create an object graphp

Hurray it worked Life is good but then something else lured my attention. The execution of the application on centos seemed to be faster. I did not believe my eyes. p  pTo confirm my observation, I eliminated network out of the equation because network reponse depends on lot of external factors.p  pI grabbed small  dummy loop code from internet, compiled it in visual studio executed in windows as well as CentOS, the results are as followsp  precodeOutput on windows console is HelloConsolebinDebuggtHelloConsole.exe Result 2.66666664666712E24 37443.6077769661 ms   Output on Centos console is [rupertbagvapp Math.Pow] mono HelloConsole.exe Result 2.66666664666712E24 28790.6286 ms codepre  pIf anyone can explain this behavior,that would be great. my laymans understanding is Monos implementation is more efficient than .NET framework.

Negative 36252 pWe have a custom function codeAppSettings.GetConnectionStringcode which is always called to determine the connection string that should be used.  How this function works is unimportant to the discussion.  It suffices to say that it returns a connection string and I have to use it.p  pI want my LINQ to SQL DataContext to use this so I removed all connection string informatin from the dbml file and created a partial class with a default constructor like thisp  precodepublic partial class SampleDataContext      public SampleDataContext  baseAppSettings.GetConnectionString    codepre  pThis works fine until I use the designer to drag and drop a table into the diagram.

Of course this means my DataContext now has two default constructors and I cant build anymorep  pI can undo all of these bad things but it is annoying.  I have to manually remove the connection string and the new files after each changep  pIs there anyway I can stop the designer from making these changes without askingp  h2EDITh2  pThe requirement to use the codeAppSettings.GetConnectionStringcode method was imposed on me rather late in the game.  I used to use something very similar to what it generates for me.    There are quite a few places that call the default constructor. I am aware that I dould change them all to create the data context in another way using a different constructor, static method, factory, ect...  That kind of change would only be slightly annoying since it would only have to be done once.  However, I feel, that it is sidestepping the real issue.  The dbml file and configuration files would still contain an incorrect, if unused, connection string which at best could confuse other developers.p

Negative 36252 pI am currently working on a big management system in PHP using Zend Framework, but that is not really revelant of the solution to this question in which I have to manage multiple entries. Each entry has many fields and span on two tables in a 1tomany relationship through a single foreign key. There is roughly 50 fields in the first table and 30 fields in the second one.p  pI am now at the stage to implement a history tracking of the different modifications made by users and some automated tasks. Each entry might enventually be rolled back partially or totally to a previous value.p  pI was thinking about using a system similiar to the one present in the CMS Typo3. One table to manage the whole history with the following fieldsp  ul lihistoryidli lientryidli lientrytableli lilastmodifcationtimestampli lilastmodificationuserli lidatali ul  pThe data would be serialized in a json or xml format.p  pMy concerns through this method is that overtime, the content of the history table would grow exponentially. To overcome this issue, I was thinking that i could make a new database to manage this history every years and then show history data by years to the users.p  pI am looking for advice about ways to improve this solution and ease the implementation. Any advice or documentation to help me will be welcomep
Negative 36252 pIm writing a TCP server on Windows Server 2k8. This servers receives data, parses it and then sinks it on a database. Im doing now some tests but the results surprises me.p  pThe application is written in C and uses, directly, Winsocks and the Windows API. It creates a thread for each client connection. For each client it reads and parses the data, then insert it into the database. p  pClients always connect in simultaneous chunks  ie. every once in a while about 5 I control this parameter clients will connect simultaneously and feed the server with data.p  pIve been timing both the readingandparsing and the databaserelated stages of each thread.p  pThe first stage readingandparsing has a curious behavoir. The amount of time each thread takes is roughly equal to each thread but is also proportional to the number of threads connecting. The server is emnotem CPU starved it has 8 cores and always less than 8 threads are connected to it. p  pFor example, with 3 simultaneous threads 100k rows for each thread will be readandparsed in about 4,5s. But with 5 threads it will take 9,1s on averagep  pA friend of mine suggested this scaling behavoir might be related to the fact Im using blocking sockets. Is this right If not, what might be the reason for this behavoirp  pIf it is, Id be glad if someone can point me out good resources for understanding non blocking sockets on Windows.p  pstrongEditstrongp  pEach client thread reads a line ie., all chars untils a n from the socket, then parses it, then read again, until the parse fails or a terminator character is found.

Negative 36252 pHow can I distinguish a variable as a compilerconstructed stringp  pFor example, while the rvalue codeHello, Worldcode is of type codeconst charcode. codeconst charcode in itself does not mean that a pointer cant be changed.  A codechar constcode pointer cant be changed, but thats not whats constructed by the compiler.p  pDoes this mean that, for any container that holds a codeconst charcode, the data should be copied by means other than Cs move semantics  Is there any way to just move compilerconstructed strings and leave all other strings alonep  pFor example, in the GCC 4.5.2, a method that returns the type codeintcode as opposed to codeintampcode is treated as returning codeintampampcode.  I dont know if the actual standard is supposed to be this way, but thats what the GCC does for the time being.p  pEdit To clarify, I mean that the actual memory that the pointer points to should be copied.  This means that new memory has to be allocated and that the data from the pointer should be copied to the new location.p

Negative 36252 pSuppose a general sliding algorithm that executes some function on a kernel, like a meanfilter averagefilter or the emsum of absolute differencesem algorithm in image processing. As the kernel slides to the next position, there will be some redundant reads from memory because the data enclosed by the new kernel will overlap that of the previous somewhat.p  pLet me explain with a practical example... Suppose you want to perform a medianfilter on a large 2D matrix with a kernel window size of 3x3. The first position of the kernel red in image below would be centered at 1,1, the second position green would be centered at 1,2. Notice how the yellow area is the overlap, and these values now need to be reloaded from memory.p  pimg srchttpluka.s3.amazonaws.commeanfilter.png altmeanfilterp  pMy specific problem is a 3D mean filter so the overlap is even bigger 3332  18 for 3D vs 323  6 for 2D.p  pIm sure this is a common problem... does anyone know how algorithms such as this are implemented efficiently to either eliminate the redundant memory lookups, or to exploit spatial and temporal locality of the CPU cache on modern architectures e.g. 2way associative cachep  pMy specific problem in 3D takes only the mean from the nearest 6 neighbours not the diagonal ones and is implemented in C as followsp  precodefor i  0 i lt maxi i       for j  0 j lt maxj j           for k  0 k lt maxk k               filteredData[ i ][ j ][ k ]               ONESIXTH                             data[ i  1 ][ j     ][ k     ]               data[ i  1 ][ j     ][ k     ]               data[ i     ][ j  1 ][ k     ]               data[ i     ][ j  1 ][ k     ]               data[ i     ][ j     ][ k  1 ]               data[ i     ][ j     ][ k  1 ]                             codepre

Negative 36252 pAre there proven patterns that anyone could share regarding Workflow 4.0 services integrated with Windows Identity Foundation We are looking for the best way to inspect the STS token and claims in order to derive who the user is outside the workflow service instance context and make the applications user object available to the workflow context. p  pWe want to maintain separation of concerns between the service implementation of WIF and workflow business logic so our workflow services are highly testable. We have seen a few examples provided which point to wrapping the Receive activity with a code activity that instantiates an implementation of IReceiveMessageCallback in order to get a reference to the OperationContext. a hrefhttpsmsmvps.comblogstheproblemsolverarchive20100924securingaworkflowserviceusingwindowsidentityfoundation.aspx relnofollowLink to Maurices Blog Post.a However, this means activities internal to the service are dependent on the existence of the operation context and possibly even the IClaimsIdentity. p  pThe best solution we can come up with so far is to create an implementation of IDispatchMessageInspector for the service that interrogates the token and creates the application user objects needed by the workflow making them available to the workflow runtime via InstanceContext.Extensions.

Negative 36252 pI have an application that imports data read from text files from a directory into a database. I have a UI that allows the user to click an import button and begin importing data and when the user clicks on that button again I wanted to stop importing the data in those files. I began using threads to allow this, so that I would not freeze up the UI while data was being imported. But Im having a few issues. I started using thread.Abort to kill the thread after the user stops wanting to import but when the user clicks import again, some duplicate data is added to the database because it begins reading at the top of the text file which I dont want. I have been told to use ManualResetEvents and Thread.Join to trigger for the import to finish, but im confused how that is supposed to work. Right now my code looks like thisp  precode    public ManualResetEvent event1  new ManualResetEventfalse     public Thread workerThread       public Form1              InitializeComponent           private void importButtonClickobject sender, EventArgs e              ifimportButton.Text  Begin Import                      importButton.Text  Stop Import             runs a service that begins reading and importing data and writing to             a console box.

Negative 36252 pI am new to software development and also new to stackoverflow, so go easy on me.p  pBACKGROUND I am developing a C class library that processes xml messages sent by a third party application over tcpip using Async sockets.  I am using cominterop in order to expose the class library to a Vb6 application.  When the C library processes the xml it receives over the socket, it raises various events that the consuming vb6 application subscribes to this way, when we eventually rewrite the entire application in .Net we will already be done with this component.p  pQUESTION I want to catch all unhandled exceptions for LOGGING PURPOSES ONLY.  In a winforms application you can hook up an event to the AppDomain.CurrentDomain.UnhandledException and to Application.ThreadException.  Is there no way to similarly grab exception data to log the information in a class libraryp  pImportant Pointsp  ul lipI am not trying to recover from these exceptions, but just log them and let the exception propogate up and crash the app if need be.pli lipI am doing my best to catch all specific exceptions locally wherever I know that they might occur.  Therefore my purpose is to just log the truly unexpected exceptions.pli liI know that some will say that this would be a bad design pattern.  I should instead let the caller deal with these exceptions.  The problem is the vb6 application does not have as robust error handling in place as I would like.  Primarily, I want to log the stack trace so that if the vb6 app crashes due to my dll, I can view the log in order to be alerted to potential areas of my c code that might need to be changed.li ul  pCan anyone provide me with some direction  The best option that I have found so far seems to put a generic try catch block in every public method, log the exception, and then throw it.  This seems less than idealp  precodepublic void SomeMethod      try               try something here...          catch Exception ex              Logex         throw       codepre  pNot only does this seem like a poor design, but additionally I do not know what would happen if one of the async callbacks causes an exception on a different thread than the method was called on.  Would this general trycatch block still catch such an exceptionp  pThanks for any assistance.p  pstrongEDITstrong I originally marked Eric J.s answer as correct, but after trying to implement the solution I have found that it wont work well with the async callbacks from the socket class that I am using.  Once a threadpool thread is used to fire the async callback, I cannot seem to catch any exceptions that occur any later in the stack.  Will I need to use an AOP framework, or is there any other way to catch these exceptionsp

Negative 36252 pIm developing an ASP.NET web site with a ntier backend utilising nHibernate  all good.  As part of the development a large portion of the Interface will be written in Flash or more specifically Flex 4.5.  In previous projects I wouldve created a webservice to broker data and actions between the Flash Interface and the business logic, however Im looking for a more flexible solution that would allow data  objects to be easily passed to and from the service endpoint without too much redevelopment and with the onus of easy consumptionby Flex and others.p  pEnter WCF that seems to provide a robust serverside solution where we can use the existing POCOs in the business layer that can be easily serialised across the wire, amongst other things.  Unfortunately Im unsure and inexperienced in this field at the best direction to enable the communication from my C WCF webservice to my Flex application, there certainly seems a few directions but without a clear and concuse path to take.  p  pI would also like the service to be able to communicate to other nonFlash clients so locking myself into one particular route is something I would like to avoid.  After some research I believe the best approach is for the WCF service to output lightweight data i.e. JSON or POX that should be easily consumed by Flex and other clients.  Unfortunately my prototyping has been rather frustrating where the only end to end route Ive got working is to Import the Webservice into the application and setting the WCF service to use basicHttpBinding, something I believe I should be avoiding as we need to implement emsomekindem of security and the desire to keep communication as lightweight as possible.  In addition, File Uploading would have to be factored in at some stage.p  pIn short, what is the best method to have Flex communicating with WCF and thats even if WCF is better than say ASMX given the brief scenario above  In addition, I would emreallyem appreciate any tutorials or links that would demostrate an endtoend system.p  pThanks in advance  Sp

Negative 36252 pemNote Im not a RoR developer, so if there is anything inaccurate in the question please correct me.emp  pRoR has its own i18n library. This library optionally uses YAML format for the localization files. In these localization files, keyvalue pairs are used where the value is the translation provided, but these keyvalue pairs can be within a scope namespace, here are exapmlesp  pOne example from here  a hrefhttpguides.rubyonrails.orgi18n.html relnofollowhttpguides.rubyonrails.orgi18n.htmlap  precodept      foo     bar baz codepre  blockquote   p... the top level key is the locale. foo is a namespace key and bar   is the key for the translation baz.p blockquote  pAnd another exapmle from here  a hrefhttprubyonrailstutorials.blogspot.com201011i18ninrails3.html relnofollowhttprubyonrailstutorials.blogspot.com201011i18ninrails3.htmlap  precodeen   contact     prices       showprice pricedollar       quote Coordinator amp quotCrucifixionamp quot amp ltbr amp gt Mr. Cheeky amp quotEr, no, freedom actually.amp quot    attributes     createdat Created at     updatedat Updated at    helpers     submit       contact         create Order         update Modify     label       contact         name Your name         companyname Company name         phone Phone number         email Email         comment Comment codepre  pPlease check the pointers for better explanation.p  pAn alternative style one can think of is to flatten the scope attributes for example, in the last quote we can sayp  precodehelpers.label.contact.companyname Company name  codepre  pI believe that the nested style can be very confusing when editing large or deeply nested localization files.

Negative 36252 pI have a website that allows users to query for specific recipes using various search criteria.  For example, you can say Show me all recipes that I can make in under 30 minutes that will use chicken, garlic and pasta but not olive oil.p  pThis query is sent to the web server over JSON, and deserialized into a codeSearchQuerycode object which has various properties, arrays, etc.p  pThe actual database query itself is fairly expensive, and theres a lot of default search templates that would be used quite frequently.  For this reason, Id like to start caching common queries.  Ive done a little investigation into various caching technologies and read plenty of other SO posts on the subject, but Im still looking for advice on which way to go.  Right now, Im considering the following optionsp  ol listrongBuilt in codeSystem.Web.Cachingcodestrong This would provide a lot of control over how many items are in the cache, when they expire, and their priority.  However, cached objects are keyed by a string, rather than a hashable object.  Not only would I need to be able to convert a codeSearchQuerycode object into a string, but the hash would have to be perfect and not produce any collisions.li listrongDevelop my own InMemory cachestrong What Id really like is a codeDictionaryltSearchQuery, Resultsgtcode object that persists in memory across all sessions.  Since search results can start to get fairly large, Id want to be able to cap how many queries would be cached and provide a way for older queries to expire.  Something like a FIFO queue would work well here.  Im worried about things like thread safety, and am wondering if writing my own cache is worth the effort here.li ol  pIve also looked into some other third party cache providers such as a hrefhttpwww.alachisoft.comncache relnofollowNCachea and a hrefhttpen.wikipedia.orgwikiVelocity28memorycache29 relnofollowVelocitya.  These are both distributed cache providers and are probably completely overkill for what I need at the moment.  Plus, it seems every cache system Ive seen still requires objects to be keyed by a string.  Ideally, I want something that holds a cache in process, allows me to key by an objects hash value, and allows me to control expiration times and priorities.p  pId appreciate any advice or references to free and preferably open source solutions that could help me out here.

The font originally came in Font Suitcase format, I converted it with FontXChange.p  pstrongAllstrong other fonts I tried work, and I the problem also appears when using hard coded strings, so this should not be a problem with character encoding. Also the problem does not appear in other programs, e.g. in Photoshop I can use all the special characters I need with this font.p  pThe problem appears on all iOS versions that support custom fonts.p

Negative 36252 pHi there I created a visual force page to with a standard lead controller as the controller and extend it.  I want to do this so i can still utilize the apexdetail control and not reinvent the wheel in dealing with the standard lead info, related list etc.p  pI added an apexcommandbutton and make it call save.  When I click on this button I can clearly see that my function is being called.  However, all changes that is done to the lead info via inline editing is not captured.p  pFor example, If I edited LastName using the inline editing and i click on the apexcommandbutton the new LastName value is not being saved.

I now compile with the classpath pointing at codelibTom.jarcode.

Is there a way to get the compiler to skip the implicit construction of codeTom.javacode if the class is found in the classpathp  pI recognize that this example is fairly contrived.  Rest assured that there is a more complicated, less contrived usecase that surrounds this issue. Thanks.p

The user enters a series of numbers and operations in the first MVC which are stored in are then stored in an array in the model of the first MVC.

If i get rid of the nonimportant parts, the filename reduces to the same pattern as the clean filenames 2E01.txt, 2E02.txt, ..., 12E01.txt. Ive managed to rename the files with the following expression came up with this one myself, dont know if is very elegant but works finep  precoderename v sSample[09]Name[AZ][09].12.txt .txt codepre  pNow, the second part, is adding a leading zero for filenames with just one digit, such as 1E01.txt turns into 01E01.txt. Ive managed to to this with found and modified this on another StackExchange post p  precoderename v unless [09]2..txt s[09]1..txt01s0[09]2..1 .txt codepre  pSo I finally got to my question is there a way to merge both expressions in just one rename command I know I could do a bash script to automate the process, but what I want is to find a onepass renaming solution.p  pthanksp

Negative 36252 pI have a certain situation here, and wanted to see the best outcome of the approach using design patterns and OOPS concept.p  pI have a webservice call which if called with different parameter lets say bed, car, and toy. For right now lets keep these parameters as const and they never change when making calls.p  pHence, based on those three parameters, it can be only one selected, and passed through the webservice call. p  pThe webservice call, initially have been constructed as a Class method. As, the whole idea was simply to get the value, make a nsurlRequest, get the data, parse and return it back in NSDictionary form.p  pNow, the business requirement have got changed, and car, and bed requires additional webservice calls, based on what accessories they require, and chosen if the customer needs it or not, proceeds the first webservice call.p  pThus, if you notice this is somewhat of a waterfall methodology, as the second service call is required to complete prior the first one in order to proceed. p  pBased on the above scenario, what could be a better approach to handle such situationp  pI have thought about using Class delegates, without changing much of the construction of the class, but just wanted to get much clear understanding if there can be any better approach.p  pI cant use GCD here, as this is being used for iOS 3.0 as well. p  pI am using NSRunloop mechanism for now with 10 seconds delay, but feels like its not a good approach.p  pThanks.p

Both exes, the newProc exe and the calling exe whose code Ive posed, are 64 bit apps.  I checked via the application properties and via Task Manager looking for the 32 tag.  Ive tried setting the platform to both x64 and Any CPU in visual studio but no luck.p  pAny ideas on why Process.Start would fail to read in these conditionsp  pNotes This is on Win7 64bit.  Both exes are C applications.  Both are using the 2.0 framework old i know but necessary.p

Negative 36252 pSorry for the title, feel free to update it if you have a better one.p  pBasically, I am writing a web api using ASP.Net Web API. I have configured a Unity container like thisp  precodestring xmlFilePath  somepath  var unity  new UnityContainer unity.RegisterTypeltPlayerControllergt unity.RegisterTypeltIRepository, XmlRepositorygt     new ContainerControlledLifetimeManager,     new InjectionConstructorxmlFilePath config.DependencyResolver  new IoCContainerunity codepre  pXmlRepository has some objects in it that represent the state of the xml file, and a timer that will write the state to an xml file every 60 seconds. This is to avoid having to rewrite the xml file every time the state changes, while limiting the maximum amount of state changes that can be lost to 60 seconds.p  pMy question is this.. The unity container creates a singleton of XmlRepository that is available to my web api throughout every call. However, what happens to the object between calls Is it in some serialized form somewhere, or does it stay in its original form so my timer will continue to functionp

Negative 36252 pI have a setup where one program reads from a named pipe and writes the read data to a socket.  Another program reads from the socket and writes the data to another named pipe.  This is on Linux across nodes.  It all works fine doing regular reads and writes on Java FileChannels but when I tried to be more efficient and used transferTo to send the named pipe data out on a socket channel the transferTo always comes back with 0 bytes transferred.

Negative 36252 pI have recently been using Clover plugin for Eclipse and its been incredibly useful. Perhaps the most useful part  the code coverage highlighting however is turning out to be incredibly annoying when writingcomposing JUNIT tests. p  pI was just wondering, is there an easy way to turn the highlighting off and back on with click of a button or keyboard shortcut. Note that I do not like to entirely turn off and disable clover coverage on a project. I just merely need to turn off the greenred highlighting on code inside the editor when I am writing my JUNITs. Is there any easy way to do that I did lot of research myself and could not find a good solution. p

Negative 36252 pIm trying to figure out programming with GLSL and Im slightly confused on what Im supposed to do. Ive figured out how to pass a vertex array, an array of texture coordinates per vertex, an element array and two textures to a simple GLSL program. Im using pygame for the simplicity while Im learning.p  pI create vertices, texture coordinates and an element array like thisp  precodew  16 h  12  vertexarray  [] texcoordarray  [] elementarray  []  for i in rangeh     for j in rangew         vertexarray  [1.0j2.0w1, 1.0i2.0h1, 0.0, 1.0]          if j2             texcoordarray  [1.0]         else             texcoordarray  [0.0]          if i2             texcoordarray  [0.0]         else             texcoordarray  [1.0]  for i in range1,h     for j in range1,w         elementarray  [i1wj1, iwj1, i1wj]         elementarray  [iwj1, iwj, i1wj] codepre  p... giving me a simple wall of textured triangles using the following shadersp  precodevertexshader   version 110  attribute vec2 texcoord attribute vec4 position  varying vec2 texcoord  void main      glPosition  position     texcoord  texcoord   codepre  pand p  precodefragmentshader   version 110  uniform sampler2D textures[2]  varying vec2 texcoord  void main      glFragColor  texture2Dtextures[0], texcoord   codepre  pRight now I get the texture mirroring in every direction on every 4 quads since I only supply one texture coord per vertex instead of passing one per element of the element array. I want to have all quads textured with the correct aligned texture since I told myself that was a good start in GLSL , what would be the way to do thisp  pThanksp  pUPDATEp  pAs Nicol Bolas pointed out  this isnt really a GLSL problem. For now Ive just redone the vertexcoordelement generation to thisp  precodefor i in rangeh     for j in rangew          first triangle         vertexarray  [1.0j2.0w1, 1.0i2.0h1, 0.0, 1.0]         texcoordarray  [0.0, 1.0]         vertexarray  [1.0j2.0w1, 1.0i12.0h1, 0.0, 1.0]         texcoordarray  [0.0, 0.0]         vertexarray  [1.0j12.0w1, 1.0i2.0h1, 0.0, 1.0]         texcoordarray  [1.0, 1.0]          second triangle         vertexarray  [1.0j2.0w1, 1.0i12.0h1, 0.0, 1.0]         texcoordarray  [0.0, 0.0]         vertexarray  [1.0j12.0w1, 1.0i12.0h1, 0.0, 1.0]         texcoordarray  [1.0, 0.0]         vertexarray  [1.0j12.0w1, 1.0i2.0h1, 0.0, 1.0]         texcoordarray  [1.0, 1.0]  elementarray  rangehw6 codepre  pAnd it works  but it feels sort of wasteful to use six times as many vertices just to get the texture coordinates right...p

They are in completely different environments where prod is behind a firewall that I have to VPN into so I cannot use linked servers.   Submitting a work order to have the DBAs do this task often takes too long so Im trying to find a systematic way to do this.br Creating a set of insert scripts based off of a select query seems to be the best and will do the trick.  The reason this will work is that these are often one time copy scripts that are staticlookup tables that arent too big.br For example if I had a table called Cars and it had a CarId and Description column, then a script would bep  precodeselect insert into Cars CarId, [Description] values   castCarId as varchar  ,   [Description]   from Cars order by CarId codepre  pIn my test database, I can simply blow out the table before I run the above insert scripts.br My prod sql user also has select access to all of the codeINFORMATIONSCHEMAcode tables, so Im wondering if anyone has come across a systematic way to write the above query.

Negative 36252 pIm helping develop a new API for an emexistingem database.  p  pIm using Python 2.7.3, Django 1.5 and the djangorestframework 2.2.4 with PostgreSQL 9.1p  pI needwant good documentation for the API, but Im shorthanded and I hate writingmaintaining documentation one of my many flaws.  p  pI need to allow consumers of the API to add new POS points of sale locations.  In the Postgres database, there is a foreign key from pos to poslocationtype.  So, here is a simplified table structure.p  precodeposlocationtype   id serial,   description text not null   pos    id serial,    posname text not null,    poslocationtypeid int not null references poslocationtypeid  codepre  pSo, to allow them to POST a new pos, they will need to give me a posname an a valid poslocationtype.  So, Ive been reading about this stuff all weekend.  Lots of debates out there.p  pHow is my API consumers going to know what a poslocationtype is  Or what value to pass here  p  pIt seems like I need to tell them where to get a valid list of poslocations.  Something likep  precodeGET poslocation codepre  pAs a quick note, examples of poslocationtype descriptions might be school, park, office.p  pI really like the Browseability of of the Django REST Framework, but, it doesnt seem to address this type of thing, and I actually had a very nice chat on IRC with Tom Christie earlier today, and he didnt really have an answer on what to do here or maybe I never made my question clear.p  pIve looked at Swagger, and thats a very coolinteresting project, but take a look at their pet resource on their a hrefhttppetstore.swagger.wordnik.compet relnofollowdemo herea.  Notice it is pretty similar to what I need to do.  To add a new pet, you need to pass a category, which they define as class Categoryid long, name string.  How is the consumer suppose to know what to pass here  Whats a valid id  or namep  pIn Django rest framework, I can defineoverride what is returned in the OPTION call.  I guess I could come up with my own little system here and return some information likep  precode poslocationurl poslocation codepre  pin the generic form, it would be resourceurl pathtoresourcelistp  pand that would sort of work for the documentation side, but Im not sure if thats really a nice solution programmatically.  What if I change the resources location. That would mean that my consumers would need to programmatically make and OPTIONS call for the resource to figure out all of the relations.  Maybe not a bad thing, but feels like a little weird.p  pSo, how do people handle this kind of thing  p  pFinal notes I get the fact that I dont really want a leaking abstaction here and have my database peaking thru the API layer, but the fact remains that there is a foreignkey constraint on this emexistingem database and any insert that doesnt have a valid poslocationtypeid is raising an error.p  pAlso, Im not trying to open up the URI vs. ID debate.  Whether the user has to use the poslocationtypeid int value or a URI doesnt matter for emthisem discussion.  In either case, they have no idea what to send me.p

Negative 36252 pI am trying to understand the whole MVCEF relationship.

Negative 36252 pI have a design were Im writingreading tofrom a RAM and perform some computation on the read values. In some cases, I read values from RAM locations where I havent written anything to yet. This is intentional because in the cases where this happens, the uninitialized values dont affect the computation in these cases, the uninitialized values are multiplied with 0.p  pHowever, multiplying an codeunsignedcodecodesignedcode type which contains codeUcode bits results in a dont care output i.e. all bits of the multiplication output are codeXcode even if the other operand is 0. Therefore, I cant check the final computation output in my testbench because it becomes dont care it seems like dont care outputs are interpreted as 0.p  pTo avoid this problem, I wrote a function that resolves any codeUcode or codeXcode bits in a codestdlogicvectorcode to code0code. The functions looks as followsp  precodefunction fx  stdlogicvector return stdlogicvector is   variable y  stdlogicvector xrange begin   y  x    pragma synthesis off   for i in 0 to xlength1 loop     case xi is       when U  X gt yi  0       when others    gt yi  xi     end case   end loop   i    pragma synthesis on   return y end codepre  pNow Id like to expand the function by not only setting codeXcode and codeUcode bits to code0code but to randomly set them to either code0code or code1code. Ive tried using the codeuniformcode function within codefcode. The problem is that when I define the two seeds within the function, that each time the function codefcode is called it returns the same codestdlogicvectorcode when it is given the same codestdlogicvectorcode. As I take it from the codeuniformcode function description, I should pass the two seeds from outside the function codefcode because they are modified by the codeuniformcode function for the next call to codeuniformcode.p  pIs there a possibility how this can be achieved using a functionp

Negative 36252 pIve an app that has a main menu screen called NfcScannerActivity. At the moment it has no launch mode standard in the manifest. If you click on getRota it takes you to the rota screen which is defined in the manifest as singleTask and is simply a listview of data from a webcall.p  pIn the rota screen you can click on nextRota from the optionsMenu bar. When this happens, an intent is launched specifying the menu screenNfcScannerActivity as this is where the webcall is made to get the next days rota data. once the data is retrieved the rota screen is launched again.p  pAll this works fine but im convinced that there are some problems in the app due to having more than one instance of the menu screen in the task. If i specify NfcScannerActivity to be SingleTask then when you click next rota it stays on the menu screen as if it hasnt handled the NEXTROTA intent action.p  pI understand that i might have to override onNewIntent in the NfcScannerActivity activity.p  pHow is this done Ive tried the following.p  precodeOverride     protected void onNewIntentIntent intent          super.onNewIntentintent         setIntentintent      codepre  p.p  pThis doesnt seem to handle the NEXTROTA intent action. thanks matt.p  p[edit1]p  pthis is what i have in the rota activity when the user clicks nextrota from the options menu.p  precodeIntent i  new Intentthis, NfcscannerActivity.class             i.setFlagsIntent.FLAGACTIVITYCLEARTOP             i.putExtranextRota, nextDay             i.setActionNEXTROTA             startActivityi codepre  p.p  pThen in the onCreate of NfcScannerActivity i have the following.p  precodeifintent.getAction.equalsIgnoreCaseNEXTROTA              Log.eTAG, next rota action             String date  intent.getStringExtranextRota                getNextRotadate            codepre  p.p  pgetNextRotadate calls an AsyncTask to make the webcall to get the data of the next rota.

The flow of events generated by onefinger and twofinger gestures are conditional depending on whether or not the selected element is clickable or scrollable... A clickable element is a link, form element, image map area, or any other element with mousemove, mousedown, mouseup, or onclick handlers... Because of these differences, you might need to change some of your elements to clickable elements...p  pIt goes on to suggest that the developer ...Add a dummy onclick handler, onclick  void0, so that Safari on iOS recognizes the span element as a clickable element.p  pHowever, my testing has shown these statements to be false.p  pJsFiddle  a hrefhttpjsfiddle.net6Ymcy1httpjsfiddle.net6Ymcy1ap  phtmlp  precodeltdiv idplaindiv onclickvoid0gtPlain Divltdivgt codepre  pjsp  precodedocument.getElementByIdplaindiv.addEventListenerclick, function     alertclick   codepre  pTry tapping the element on an iPad.  strongNothing Happensstrongp  pBut I digress.

Negative 36252 pBear with me as Im not terribly savvy in multithreaded programming...p  pIm currently building out a system that uses a ThreadPool ExecutorService for various runnables. That much is straightforward. However, Im looking at the possibility of having the runnables themselves spawn an additional runnable based on what happens in the original runnable ie, if success, do this, if fail, do this, etc as some tasks must be complete before others execute. It should be noted that the main thread does not need to be notified of the results of these tasks, although it might be handy for handling exceptions, ie, if an external service cannot be contacted and all threads are throwing exceptions as a result, then stop submitting tasks and periodically check on the external service until it comes back up. This isnt completely necessary, but it would be nice.p  pIe, submit Task A. Task A does some things. If everything goes well, Task A will execute Task B. If something doesnt work out properly or an exception is thrown, execute Task C. Each child task may also have additional tasks, but only a few levels deep. Id much rather do something like this than large, snarled conditionals in a single task as this approach allows for much greater flexibility.p  pHowever, Im not certain how this would affect the thread pool. I would assume that any additional threads created from within a thread in the pool would exist outside of the pool as they themselves were not submitted directly to the pool. Is this a correct assumption If so, its likely a bad idea well, if not, it may not be a very good idea anyway as it could result in a lot more threads as the original thread completes and a new task is submitted while the thread spawned from the earlier task is still going and may last considerably longer than others.p  pIve also considered implementing these as Callables instead and placing a response object in the Future that is returned, then add the appropriate Callable to the thread pool based on the response. However, this would tie all actions back to the main thread, which seems an unnecessary bottleneck. I suppose I could place a Runnable into the pool that itself handles the execution of the Callable and subsequent actions, but then I get twice as many threads.p  pAm I on the right track here or am I completely off the railsp

Is there any way that Bind the width without using ElementNamep  pThank you so muchp  precodeltWindow xClassWindow1 xmlnshttpschemas.microsoft.comwinfx2006xamlpresentation

Negative 36252 pI have implemented my own datasource in Go, which returns a JSON string. The data source is working fine and returning the correct JSON format expected by the chart which is actually a table object to make the tests easier.p  pNow, Id like to be able to use the query language features for my chart and something I could not figure out is how exactly the query language works. Lets take the table below as examplep  precodeName      Age  Phone  John       23  12341234 Chris      47  54223452 Sam        36  69694356 codepre  pWhen called, my datasource will return a JSON representation of the entire table above. In theory, I should be able to do something like this from my Javascriptp  pquery.setQueryselect Name, Age p  pSo, the result would ignore the column Phone.p  pNow, my question isp  pIs the setQuery method applied to the JSON response only, or my datasource should be able to handle the query on request and return the correct data only Name and Age columns. Im not sure if the query language will act on the JSON response or if its just an interface to tell the server what to do and the server should be able to prepare the correct data.p  pIm asking that because as I said, my JSON response works fine, however the setQuery method is being ignored. My table always shows the entire Dataset, no matter what I put on the setQuery method. Even if I define a column which does not exist, it does not cause any error. I did some tests using a google spreadsheet and it works just fine. I should add that the structure of the JSON response from my app and the one from the google spreadsheet looks exactly the same. Any help would be very much appreciated.p  pThanks,p  pJBp
Negative 36252 pIm trying to isolate a problem with a violation of a unique key index.

Negative 36252 pIm currently trying out C and WPF for the first time.p  pI have a window with two tabs, codetabAcode and codetabBcode. Each tab has a list box they are almost identical, codetabAcode has codelistboxAcode and codetabBcode has codelistboxBcode. When an item in a list box is selected, some information about the item is shown, so that I know that it is selected.p  pOn a certain event codeEcode, I want an item in codelistboxAcode or codelistboxBcode to be highlighted and selected, which one is determined by the logic in my application.p  pScenario A is that I am currently on codetabAcode. When codeEcode occurs, an item in codelistboxAcode is chosen. I call codelistboxA.Focuscode, and then codelistboxA.SelectedItem  itemcode. This works fine. codeitemcode is selected, so the information about the item is shown, and the item is highlighted in the list.p  pScenario B, where I have my problem, is that I am currently on codetabAcode. When codeEcode occurs, an item in codelistboxbBbcode is chosen. I call codetabControl.SelectedItem  tabBcode to switch the tab, which works fine. As in Scenario A, I call codelistboxB.Focuscode and then codelistboxB.SelectedItem  itemcode. The item is selected, because the information about the item is shown, but, heres the thing bThe item is not highlighted in the list boxb. p  pThis also happens when changing from codetabBcode to codetabAcode. It always happens when I change the tab, but if I stay in the same tab the highlight works fine.p  pDoes anyone know if theres anything else I need to do to give the list box the focus after changing the tab, apart from calling codeFocuscodep

Negative 36252 pIm learning about binary search and the basic definition starts with an iterator to the first element and another one to the last. You also have a key, which is the element you are looking for. The key is compared to the value of the midpoint first and then upper half or lower half is eliminated depending on whether the key is larger or smaller than the value of the midpoint. And the process continues until there is a match.p  pWouldnt this method require that the container you are looking through is sorted Otherwise I dont see how the comparison between the key and values in the container to eliminate portions of the container to look through is any particular use.p

Negative 36252 pSo, I have a custom Android application running as System built as a system app in my ROM. And Ive written a native daemon that works fine too and runs as root. However, I was wondering how the two can communicate I know I can have the native daemon create a network socket and have the App connect to it, but using a local socket for IPC seems even better, but I am struggling to find example code for it. p  pI figured I could create the socket like as described a hrefhttpwww.gnu.orgsoftwarelibcmanualhtmlnodeLocalSocketExample.html relnofollowherea but I have no idea how to communicate with it in Java. p  pAny help would be much appreciated. p  pAlso, at first I wrote a native library and used JNI to communicate with it from Java, but quickly realized that it obviously runs in the context of the app, so it cant be run as root, which is a requirement I have, and something the native daemon can do fine. Is using sockets the best alternative here or would Binder work toop  pThanks a tonp

Negative 36252 pHi Im trying to slide up a codeRelativeLayoutcode over a codeSupportMapFragmentcode. Something like thisp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comup0vx.png altenter image description herep  pWhen I click in the marker the codeRelativeLayoutcode slides up. My problem is that as we all know, the SupportMapFragments relies in the codeSurfaceViewcode so any animation that I do over the codeSupportMapFragmentcode isnt shown until the view gets invalidated, for example, when I click the pause button. I cant show you the code because is in my job pcs. But theres nothing from another world. Just a plain and simple codeTranslateAnimationcode that I load with codeAnimationUtils.loadcontext,resourcecode. I even test the animation in another fragments and work well. Well, my question is Theres some workaround for this kind of problem, maybe wrap the codeSupportMapFragmentcode inside another view or something like thatp  pAny tip is welcomep  pstrongUPDATEstrong Basically in the xml I have the codeSupportMapFragmentcode and the codeRelativeLayoutcode. In the code I take the codeRelativeLayoutcode with the codefindViewByIdcode then I load the animation with codeAnimationUtilscode I set the animation to the codeRelativeLayoutcode with the codesetAnimationcode method and later I start the animation. Seems work pretty well in another fragments, I doubt that the problem is here.p

Windows Forms is a perfect example of this.  In order to separate the view from the model, a presenter is needed.  Since the view cannot directly bind to the presenter, information must be passed to it view an interface IView. p  pstrongMVVMstrongp  pUse in situations where binding via a datacontext is possible.  Why  The various IView interfaces for each view are removed which means less code to maintain. Some examples where MVVM is possible include WPF and javascript projects using Knockout. p  pstrongMVCstrongp  pUse in situations where the connection between the view and the rest of the program is not always available and you cant effectively employ MVVM or MVP. This clearly describes the situation where a web API is separated from the data sent to the client browsers.  Microsofts ASP.NET MVC is a great tool for managing such situations and provides a very clear MVC framework p  pbut i have not found a single article which discuss the difference theoretically  along with sample code.p  pit would be really nice if i get a article which discuss the difference between this 3 design patterns MVC MVP amp MVVM along with code.p  psuppose if i get 3 same strongCRUDstrong apps code which has been implemented by three design patter MVC MVP amp MVVM. so i can go through the code and understand how one should write code for these three design patter MVC MVP amp MVVM. p  pso if any such article exist which discuss how code would looks different for 3 design patterns MVC MVP amp MVVM then please redirect me to that article. thanksp
Negative 36252 pI am working on an old MFC app. The app uses some icons applied on buttons such asp  precodembtnMyButton.SetIconIDIICON21, BSCENTER, IDIICON21 codepre  pI wish to place the icons at the center of the buttons, however, the icons themselves are not centered. Basically they seem to be offset by random amounts. For exampleimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comBUo1x.jpg altenter image description here I have added the black rectangles to show what I mean.p  pI know I can trim the whitespace off these iconscenter these icons before compiling resources.I know a hrefhttpwww.imagemagick.orgscriptcommandlineoptions.phptrim relnofollowImageMagika can batch do this for me. But I do not want to change the original icons on disk may be used elsewhere.p  pWhat I want to do is maybe make a function in my code which does this trimming before applying the icon. That way I wont need to worry about any new or missed out icons.p  pCan anyone provide some insight about how I can trim the icons in my code Need to keep in mind that the offset for these icons is random, so I would need to find the offset to trim first.p

Negative 36252 pI am hoping I can find some help here, Ive been researching and trying over and again but cant seem to find a solution. I am using processing 2.0.3.p  pI have an SVG file that is a map of US states. I have an excel sheet saved as a .csv with data for each state. Ive been trying to find a way to click on the state on the displayed SVG file, and have it display some sort of graph from the data in the excel sheet.p  pMy questions are How do I make the SVG file clickable, and how do I link it to the data The solution Ive seen around the internet is to create an invisible shape layer with all the states having a slightly different color, detecting that color on a click of the mouse will determine the color and read it from the data. Ive attempted to recreate the examples I found but they are not making sense and I feel like I am at a wall.

Negative 36252 pIve got this method that is passed an array of files. It then replaces any codecode with codecode. Then I call a method and pass the array to it, which puts the argument into a emnewem array, formats the itand returns the new array. Next, I call the same method again, pass it the same local array, format it differently, and codeoutcode both arrays.

Is there an easy way to make an actual copy of it so that way Im not getting basically codelocalPathbuildPathmoddedFilecodep

Negative 36252 pI have an EC2based REST web service which is connected to a set of worker instances via SQS. I am hoping to replace this current setup with a hrefhttpwww.celeryproject.org relnofollowCelerya, retaining for the moment SQS as the broker. p  pI am not sure my mental picture of how Celery operates is quite accurate, however. Following the pattern that seems to be implied in a hrefhttpblog.4psa.comoffloadingtoworkersahandsonexample relnofollowthisa article, my understanding was that I could enqueue messages to SQS from my API, and these would then be processed by the Celery workers in a timely fashion. The examples I have found, however almost none of which involve using SQS as a broker, seem to indicate that Celery emitselfem does the enqueuing. So Celery acts like a wrapper for the queue, submitting and processing tasks. Its acting as both producer emandem consumer  is that right If so that seems like a big problem for me, since I dont use Python. The workers themselves would use execl to run the actual tasks, but how would I handle the initial submission of the message into the queue, from the API server Is this something that Celery even allowsp  pAm I right about this, or was my original understanding accurate Or are they equally legitimate ways in which Celery can be utilizedp

Negative 36252 pThis is my first activity with great stack overflow, but absolutely not my first time to visit the website.p  pMy Questionbr  In our project, we are extending the EntityTypeConfiguration to take control over the mapping of entities to the DB in code first fluent API.br  What I am confused with is how it is possible to include the configuration of complex types in the ctor of derived configuration, i.e. The configuration of primitive properties is possible through Property method of base EntityTypeConfiguration, but when calling this method on properties of type of Complex Types, the project builds will stop at called method.p  pActually, the DB will be generated by entity table containing multiple columns, representing the fields of the embedded Complex Type using codePROPERTYNAMEINNERFIELDNAMEcode naming convention, even though if the complex type be of class type.br br  So, I do not know how to overcome with the issue if the complex type be of class type.p  pThank you for your kind consideration.p  pMy Codebr p  precodeclass Entity      long Id     Address Addr   class Address      string City     string ZipCode   class EntityConfig  EntityTypeConfigurationltEntitygt      EntityConfig              Propertypgtp.Addr  Build error       codepre

Negative 36252 pIm trying to model my MongoDB database with Mongoid, and trying to create relations for the following relationshipp  ul liUser can own a Projectli liProject is owned by Userli liUser can be a collaborator in a Project but not an ownerli liProject has many collaborators Usersli ul  pSo basically, a user can own projects and collaborate on a project. These are two different roles. An owner, a User, through the 1N relationship, can perform tasks on a project. A collaborator, a User, through the NN relationship, can perform a separate set of tasks on a project.p  pThe solution I came up with is thisp  precode appmodelsuser.rb class User   include MongoidDocument   include MongoidTimestamps    field name,     type String   field email,    type String   field username, type String    hasmany projects end   appmodelsproject.rb class Project   include MongoidDocument   include MongoidTimestamps    field title,     type String   field summary,   type String   field permalink, type String   field collaboratorids, type Array, default []    belongsto user    def collaborators     arr  []      self.collaboratorids.each do id       arr ltlt User.findid     end      arr   end end codepre  pIts obviously not ideal is there another way to do this Id much rather use Mongoids codehasandbelongstomanycode relationship instead of the ObjectIDs in an Array hack that I have.p

Negative 36252 pHaskell Arrows are commonly explained as expressing a directed acyclic graph DAG of computations. Im looking for tools or library code that would use this relationship in aid of programming with Arrows.p  pFrom Arrow to graph, a tool could help visualize Arrow code. Since the code corresponds to a DAG of computations, a visual representation showing computational nodes and outputtoinput edges is natural. A tool could create a graph to be viewed and manipulated with standard graph tools. p  pIs there Arrow transformer that augments an arbitrary compuatational Arrow class, capturing the structure provided by  and  operations, and making it possible to inspect the computation as a graph of elementary Arrow operationsp  pFrom graph to Arrow, suppose there is a DAG whose nodes are Arrow operations. Is there a tool that would construct from this an Arrow which computes the entire DAGp  pIve Googled much of whats written about Haskell Arrows without finding such visualization tools. Did I miss something Perhaps there is not as natural a fit as I expect.p

Negative 36252 pI have implemented a simple LRU cache as a doubly linked list written manually from scratch. The cache is filled with objects Request distinguished by their numeric integer ID. These Request objects are generated as a stream of L random independent and identically distributed requests for a set of N lt L predefined Request objects and arrive to the cache one by one i.e. in a serial fashion. Then I check for cache hit or miss and if the current cache size has reached the maximum cache size and then, depending on the case, I perform insertion of the requested item to the cache or replacement of the LRU cached item from the requested item.p  pOne of the operations of the cache is the following when I have a cache hit, then if the requested item is not in the head, it has to be moved there. p  pAs an example, lets say that the cache has max size M  4 and its contents at a given time are as followsp  pItem                 7  3  4  5p  pCache position index 0  1  2  3 0 is head, 3 is tailp  pNow if we have for example a cache hit for the item 4, since this item is not located at the head of the cache, it should be moved there and the result will bep  pItem                 4  7  3  5p  pCache position index 0  1  2  3 0 is head, 3 is tailp  pHowever, when I run the code the result is this insteadp  pItem                 4 7  3  4  5p  pCache position index 0  1  2  3  4 0 is head, 4 is tailp  pIn other words, the relevant item in this example, item 4 is not removed from the cache and then added to the head, but it is simply added to the head. Therefore, cache size is increased by 1 in this example, it has become 5, which is greater than the max cache size M  4. p  pHere is the relevant code, along with a comment that shows I think the nature of the problemp  precodepublic void moveToHeadRequest request           ifrequest  head                set previous node equal to the requested item             request.left  request               gt if I set here request  null then I will move to the head a null object What to do lt               move requested item to head             head.left  request             request.right  head             head  request                 codepre  pAs I state to the comment, if after the first line of code I set the object request to null in order to remove it, then the following lines of code will move to the head a null object.

Negative 36252 pI have developed an ExtendedDataModel that supports Pagination on the server side by querying a db. Everything works as i expected, the pagination occurs and works fine. But, at the same time, i want to load the data of each page in client side with ajax, so i would also like to set the clientRows property for my extendedDataTable, and not only the rows attribute that divides each logical page. In general, i want to be able to set clientRows lt rows, so i get pagination  ajax loading in each page. But, at the moment this only works when i set clientRowsrows which obviously isnt what i need. p  pWhat is happening right now is that if i set the clientRows attribute, then the walk method recieves a range which goes only up to clientRows rows, and ignores the row attribute completely.

A LastInFirstOut buffer,   called the return stack buffer,remembers the return address every time   a call instruction is executed, and it uses this for predicting where   the corresponding return will go. This mechanism makes sure that   return instructions are correctly predicted when the same subroutine   is called from several  different locations.p blockquote  pI am a little unclear what the need for this is, given that the return addresses are stored on the stack anywayp  pSo what is the purpose of storing return addresses on the stack if there is also this technique Is the stackstored value only used if this prediction technique doesnt workp

Negative 36252 pWell, this is much discussed question, but still not clear I need to use a database connection in separate thread. When I create this thread, I know all valid connection parameters because I already have one valid connection. p  pSo, i wish to clone this valid connection, try open it, and if its ok  pass it to constructor of my thread worker object, and then run a thread In this case im sure, that my thread will work.p  pThe another approach is  to pass just connection params into constructor, and establish new connection just after thread runs within QThread.Started, for example. So, I need a way to inform ctrator thread about fails, if any.p  pThe first approach looks much easier, and works fine, but contradicts to a hrefhttpqtproject.orgdocqt4.8threadsmodules.htmlthreadsandthesqlmodule relnofollowthis statementa. So, bthe question isb  is it just a luck, and I have to follow the second approach anyway, borb the Qt docs only forbids me of using same connection from thwo or more different threads, and my first approach will work fine p

Negative 36252 pMy question is a followup to a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions22821651howtomakethiscodefasterlearningbestpracticesHow to make this code faster learning best practicesa, which has been put on hold bummer. The problem is to optimize a loop over an array with floats which are tested for whether they lie within a given interval. Indices of  matching elements in the array are to be stored in a provided result array.p  pThe test includes two conditions smaller than the upper threshold and bigger than the lower one. The obvious code for the test is codeif elem lt upper ampamp elem gt lower  ...code. I observed that branching including the implicit branch involved in the shortcircuiting operatorampamp is much more expensive than the second comparison. What I came up with is below. It is about 2040 faster than a naive implementation, more than I expected. It uses the fact that bool is an integer type. The condition test result is used as an index into two result arrays. Only one of them will contain the desired data, the other one can be discarded. This replaces program structure with data structure and computation.p  pI am interested in more ideas for optimization. Technical hacks of the kind provided here are welcome. Im also interested in whether modern C could provide means to be faster, e.g. by enabling the compiler to create parallel running code. Think visitor patternfunctor. Computations on the single srcArr elements are almost independent, except that the order of indices in the result array depends on the order of testing the source array elements. I would loosen the requirements a little so that the order of the matching indices reported in the result array is irrelevant. Can anybody come up with a fast way p  pHere is the source code of the function. A supporting main is below. gcc needs stdc11 because of chrono. VS 2013 express was able to compile this too and created 40 faster code than gcc O3.p  precodeinclude ltcstdlibgt include ltiostreamgt include ltchronogt  using namespace std using namespace stdchrono   Check all elements in srcArr whether they lie in   the interval [lower, upper]. Store the indices of  such elements in the array pointed to by destArr[1]  and return the number of matching elements found.  This has been highly optimized, mainly to avoid branches. int findElemsInInterval    const float srcArr[],    contains candidates                             int const destArr,     two arrays to be filled with indices                             const int arrLen,        length of each array                             const float lower, const float upper  interval                                Instead of branching, use the condition       as an index into two distinct arrays. We need to keep      separate indices for both those arrays.     int destIndices[2]          destIndices[0]  destIndices[1]  0     for int srcInd0 srcIndltarrLen srcInd                If the element is inside the interval, both conditions          are true and therefore equal. In all other cases           exactly one condition is true so that they are not equal.          Matching elements indices are therefore stored in destArr[1].          destArr[0] is a kind of a dummy it will incidentally contain          indices of nonmatching elements.          This used to be with a simple int destArr          if srcArr[srcInd] lt upper ampamp srcArr[srcInd] gt lower destArr[destIndex]  srcInd         int isInInterval  srcArr[srcInd] lt upper  srcArr[srcInd] gt lower         destArr[isInInterval][destIndices[isInInterval]]  srcInd               return destIndices[1]   the number of elements in the results array      int mainint argc, char argv[]      int arrLen  10001000100     if argc gt 1  arrLen  atolargv[1]       destArr[1] will hold the indices of elements which      are within the interval.     int destArr[2]       we dont check destination boundaries, so make them       the same length as the source.     destArr[0]  new int[arrLen]        destArr[1]  new int[arrLen]      float srcArr  new float[arrLen]       Create always the same numbers for comparison dont srand.     for int srcInd0 srcIndltarrLen srcInd  srcArr[srcInd]  rand       Create an interval in the middle of the rand spectrum     float lowerLimit  RANDMAX3     float upperLimit  lowerLimit2     cout ltlt lower   ltlt lowerLimit ltlt , upper   ltlt upperLimit ltlt endl      int numInterval      auto t1  highresolutionclocknow  measure clock time as an approximation       Call the function a few times to get a longer run time     for int srcInd0 srcIndlt10 srcInd            numInterval  findElemsInInterval srcArr, destArr, arrLen, lowerLimit, upperLimit       auto t2  highresolutionclocknow      auto duration  stdchronodurationcastltstdchronomillisecondsgt t2  t1 .count      cout ltlt numInterval ltlt  elements found in  ltlt duration ltlt  milliseconds.  ltlt endl      return 0  codepre

The user is located at the strongred starstrong, and wants to get to the strongorange Xstrong.p  pIf I naively look for the nearest vertex and use that as my starting point, the user is often directed to a suboptimal path, that involves walking further away from their destination at the start i.e. the strongred solid pathstrong.p  pThe strongblue solid pathstrong is the optimal path that my algorithm would ideally come up with.p  pNotesp  ul liAssume no paths cross over other paths.li liWhen navigating to a starting point, the user should never cross over a path e.g. sidewalk.li liIn the image above, the first line segment coming out of the star is created dynamically, simply to assist the user. The star is not a vertex in the graph since the user can be anywhere inside the grass region. The line segment from the star to a vertex is simply being displayed so that the user knows how to get to the first valid vertex in the graph.li ul  pHow can I implement this efficiently and correctlyp  hr  pstrongIdea 1 Find the enclosing polygonstrongp  pIf I find the smallest polygon which surrounds my starting point, I can now create new paths for Dijkstras algorithm from the starting point which will be added as a new vertex temporarily to each of the vertices that make up the polygon. In the example above, the polygon has 6 sides, so this would mean creating 6 new paths to each of its vertices i.e. the strongblue dotted linesstrong. I would then be able to run Dijkstras algorithm and it would easily determine that the blue solid line is the optimal path.p  pThe problem with this method is in determining which vertices comprise the smallest polygon that surrounds my point. I cannot create new paths to each vertex in the graph, otherwise I will end up with the strongred dotted linesstrong as well, which completely defeats the purpose of using Dijkstras algorithm I should not be allowed to cross over a sidewalk. Therefore, I must take care to only create paths to the vertices of the enclosing polygon. Is there an algorithm for thisp  pThere is another complication with this solution imagine the user now starts at the strongpurple lightning boltstrong. It has no enclosing polygon, yet the algorithm should still work by connecting it to the 3 points at the top right. Again, once it is connected to those, running Dijkstras is easy.br strongUpdatestrong the reason we want to connect to one of these 3 points and not walk around everything to reach the orange X directly is because we want to minimize the walking done on unpaved paths. Note This is only a constraint if you start outside a polygon. We dont care how long you walk on the grass if it is within a polygon.p  pIf this is the correct solution, then please post its algorithm as an answer.p  pOtherwise, please post a better solution.p
Negative 36252 pEdit the comments below the accepted answer show that it might be an issue with the Android dynamic loader.p  pI have a header for a template class with a static member. At runtime the address of the static member is used in the library and in the client code. The template is implicitly instantiated both in the library and in the client code. It works fine on Linux and OSX, the symbol is duplicated but marked as uniqued as shown by nm see below. However when I compile for ARM Android, the symbol is marked weak in both the DSO and the executable. The loader does not unify and the symbol is effectively duplicated at runtimep  pI read these a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions11666166twoinstancesofastaticmemberhowcouldthatbetwo instances of a static member, how could that bea a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions4924082statictemplatedatamembersstorageStatic template data members storagea and especially this answer a hrefhttpstackoverflow.coma25055282077394httpstackoverflow.coma25055282077394a and a hrefhttpgcc.gnu.orgwikiVisibility relnofollowhttpgcc.gnu.orgwikiVisibilityap  pbut I am still a little bit puzzled.

Each role also has a company and leader associated with it although leader is optional as they can be the highest. There are 8 levels of users but for some companies the maximum level they may use could be 3 or 4, so it varies. p  pAs above, user 101 is under user 102 for one role and company. Then for another role user 102 is under user 101 for different company. A level 2 user can only see level 1 users which are assigned under him.p  pA level 4 user, however, can only see those level 1 users who belong to in the teams under him. If you think of it as a tree like structure, they can only see the users on their branches. Now, if I pass a userid103, how can I query whether he can be accessed by current logged in user id101. As you can see, both 100 and 101 are level 4 on the same company. However, only 101 can see 103. p  phow can query that in MySQL Or will it be better to restructure the tables for easier query.p

Negative 36252 pI have built a simple wish list app in Tornado. The user adds URL to the product and the app keeps tracking its price. The flow is simple, the user logs in, there is a form and user pastesenters the url in the form and clicks submit. This makes a post request to my server and that url will be added to database. p  pFor submit I am using ajax. So, it submits the request and refreshes the wishlist table in the page. However as this takes time, the users think the app is not working and tend to press submit multiple times. It takes time, as my server verifies the URL, fetches its price, image and other details. p  pDuring initial stages, I was talking directly to Tornado server. When I press submit button multiple times, Tornado would add it only once. I dont know how it managed to ignore same requests or how it figured out its same request, which is being processed. Since it never occurred, I never thought about it. p  pNow there are four instances of Tornado are running behind a Nginx server. So I guess Nginx is passing the request to different tornado instances when multiple times submit is pressed. p  pSo how do I avoid this p  ul lipI could create a local storage in browser for every session and maintain list of URLs. When submit is pressed and if URL is already present in the list, then dont send the request. And I would destroy this storage whenever tab is closed.pli lipdisable submit button once the url is submitted and till it receives reply from the serverpli lipgive a facebook style notification when the submit is pressed and hope user does not press submit again. pli lipconfigure nginx load balancer to work on iphash mode. so that the user always gets to served by same instance of Tornadopli lipmay be configure nginx somehow that it ignores same POST requests as single instance of Tornado was doing earlier pli ul  pHeres the code in question not sure if it actually matters p  precodeclass ProductsHandlerBaseHandler     tornado.web.authenticated     def getself          ...          ...      def postself         useremail  self.getsecurecookietrakr         userdb  self.application.db.users         productdb  self.application.db.products         producturl  self.getargumentproducturl, None         if not producturl             self.redirectproducts             return          vendor, url  utils.getvendorproducturl          if not vendor             self.redirectproducts             return           this is where it checks whether the URL is already present in DB or not         productdoc  productdb.findoneurl url          if not productdoc              ...              ...                         producturl, productname, productimgurl, productprice  vendorfuncmap[vendorid]url              productid  strproductdb.insertvendorname vendorname,                 vendorid vendorid,                  name productname, url url,                 imgurl uploadtoimgurproductimgurl,                  price productprice                  ...                  ...                          else             productid  productdoc[id]           add this product to users db          ...         self.redirectproducts codepre  pand jquery code for ajax p  precodeltscript typetextjavascriptgt     document.readyfunction         productaddform.onsubmit,function             var producturl  producturl.val             console.logproducturl             var dataString  producturl producturl             .ajax                 type POST,                 url products,                 data dataString,                 success function                      producttablediv.loadproducts producttablediv                                       return false               ltscriptgt codepre  pThe HTML formp  precodeltdiv idproductaddgt     ltform actionproducts methodpost idproductaddformgt         ltfieldsetgt             ltlabel forproducturlgtProductUrlltlabelgt             ltinput classtextinput idproducturl nameproducturl tabindex1 typetext valuegt         ltfieldsetgt         ltdiv idformbtngt             ltinput idprodaddbtn classbtn btnblue typesubmit valueSubmit tabindex3gt         ltdivgt     ltformgt ltdivgt codepre

Negative 36252 pIm trying to set up some test software for code that is already written that I cannot change.  The issue Im having is that it is getting hung up on certain calls, so I want to try to implement something that will kill the process if it does not complete in x seconds.  p  pThe two methods Ive tried to solve this problem were to use fork or pthread, both havent worked for me so far though.  Im not sure why pthread didnt work, Im assuming its because the static call I used to set up the thread had some issues with the memory needed to run the function I was calling I continually got a segfault while the function I was testing was running.  Fork worked initially, but on the second time I would fork a process, it wouldnt be able to check to see if the child had finished or not.  p  pIn terms of semipseudo code, this is what Ive writtenp  precodetestrunner      bool result      testClass myTestClass  new testClass      pidt pID  fork     ifpID  0 Child              myTestClassgttestfunction function in question being tested          else ifpID gt 0 Parent              int status         sleep5         ifwaitpid0,ampstatus,WNOHANG  0                      killpID,SIGKILL If child hasnt finished, kill process and fail test             result  false                  else             result  true       codepre  pThis method worked for the initial test, but then when I would go to test a second function, the ifwaitpid0,ampstatus,WNOHANG  0 would return that the child had finished, even when it had not.  p  pThe pthread method looked along these linesp  precodebool result  testrunner      long thread  1      pthreadt threadhandle  pthreadt malloc sizeofpthreadt     pthreadcreateampthreadhandle[thread], NULL, ampfuncTest, void ampthread Begin class that tests function in question      sleep10      ifpthreadcancelthreadhandle[thread]  0         Child process got stuck, deal with accordingly     else         Child process did not get stuck, deal with accordingly   static void funcTestvoid      result  false      testClass myTestClass  new testClass     result  myTestClassgttestfunction  codepre  pObviously there is a little more going on than what Ive shown, I just wanted to put the general idea down.  I guess what Im looking for is if there is a better way to go about handling a problem like this, or maybe if someone sees any blatant issues with what Im trying to do Im relatively new to C.  Like I mentioned, Im not allowed to go into the code that Im setting up the test software for, which prevents me from putting signal handlers in the function Im testing.  I can only call the function, and then deal with it from there.  p

Negative 36252 pIm currently using a Canvas with an associated BufferStrategy. How can I copy the contents image of the Canvas and save it to a BufferedImage. So far Ive only triedp  precodeBufferedImage image  ... g  image.createGraphics canvas.printAllg or paintAll codepre  pHowever, it appears that only a blank filled with the background color screen is being drawn I its assume because thats the default behavior of codeCanvas.paintcode. Is there as way for me to retrieve the image currently on screen the last one shown with codeBufferStrategy.showcode, or do I need to draw to a BufferedImage and copy the image to the BufferStrategys graphics. It seems like that wouldcould be a big slow down would itp  pWhy because I know someone wants to ask I already have a set of classes set up as a framework, using Canvas, for building games that can benefit from rapidly refreshing screens, and Im looking to make an addon framework to have one of these canvases tied into a remote server, sending its displayed image to other connected clients. Along the lines of remotely hosting a game. Im sure there are better ways to do this in given particular cases e.g. why does the server need to display the game at all But Ive already put in a lot of work and am wondering if this method is salvageable without modifying to much of the underlying Game framework code I already have.p

Negative 36252 pIm using wxWidgets3.0.2 and CodeBlocks on Windows compiled with MinGW.p  pI started with the sample wxSmithframes project. I plopped a wxButton and a wxStaticText widget on the frame, wrote and little code, and I was in business.p  pThen I started thinking about where I would put code. C is quite a bit less opinionated on directory structures than other languages, but OK. It seems that a lot of packages, include wxWidgets, put their source code into src.p  pI did this. Everything compiles. No worries so far.p  pThen I added more widgets. These appear in the .cpp file, but corresponding entries dont appear in the .h file. Basically, the designertocode linkage is broken. Double click on the widget and nothing happens It used to bring me to an event method in the .cpp file.p  pI moved the code back to the main directory as created by CodeBlocks when I created the sample application upon project creation.p  pThe designer works as it had in the past. I can add another wxButton, double click on it, and it creates the event method.p  pSo, this is a long, roundabout way of asking is there a way to move the source code and still have the designer functionp

Negative 36252 pThe following problem occurred to me while thinking about how to implement a linker for 80286 programsp  blockquote   pGiven an integer emnem and a set of sections where each section has a size no larger than emnem, find a partitioning of emSem with the least number of partitions such that in each partition the sum of the sectionsizes does not exceed emnem.p blockquote  pThis problem appears when trying to link object files into a program for the 80286 architecture in 16nbspbit protected mode. This architecture has segments of up to 65536 bytes each and complex programs need to be split into multiple segments. The linker tries to arrange the program into the least possible number of segments since each segment corresponds to one entry in the operating systems segment descriptor table. Please consider this problem without considering the fact that the 16nbspbit protected mode is obsolete.p  pAs a complication of this problem, one could consider the callgraph of the program to link. Considering the case that each change of the code segment has a little penalty the CPU has to look up the new segment in the segment descriptor table, the linker could try to group functions into the same section that call oneanother. When the call graph is weighted by the expected number of calls, the linker could try to find a partitioning of the program into segments so that the edges of the call graph that cross segment boundaries have the lowest sum  sum of squares.p  h2Questionsh2  ol liI have the hunch that the original problem might easily be NPhard, but Im not sure how to show that. Is it NPhardli liIs there a fast algorithm to approximate a good solutionli liIs there an algorithm to solve the second problem or to approximate a good solutionli liI appreciate pointers to further material on the topic of distributing code into segments.li ol

It is optional, and if it exists it can exist several times and the elements can have different names depending of type of Relation. If it exists I always want to save all of it so I wonder what the best way is to handle thisp  pRegardsp  pemEDITemp  pIf the element Relations exists, it can have one or several Relation element and subelements with different names. Im not sure how to handle it, maybe its best to use a ChoiceRouter first to check if Relations exist. If it does Ill need to have a foreach and then do huge amount of checks to see which subelements are there so I could save them all to the database.p

Negative 36252 pI am attempting to do practice problems of how a def function code works. Although I believe my procedure so far is not correct.  Here is the codep  precodedef main     max0     getMax1,2,max     printmax  def getMaxv1,v2,max     if v1gtv2         maxv1     else         maxv2 main codepre  pAnd here is my reasoning through it. p  pExecution of the main function begins where max0. The next line has initialized the local variable codegetMaxcode. codev1code is replaced with 1, codev2code is placed with 2, and codemaxcode is replaced with 0. Going back to the main function, python prints codemaxcode which is 0. Which is why the output is 0. The main function is now finished, and it returns the control to its callerwhich is codemaincode.  Is my procedure correct What is messing me up is I usually see the codegetMaxcodeor the local variable I think its called first before I see the codedef maincode function. does order matter here Because the if loop was completely ignored in my opinion in the codedef maincode function.p

Negative 36252 pMy department has installed google analytics on our companies website and none of us are exactly experts on understanding why the data is the way it is.p  pAnyways, our company is fairly large, but I wouldnt say we are exactly a well known company. We provide internet and Video on Demand to Hotels worldwide. Anyways, as of right now, since I have installed our code last month, we have a total session number of over 78,000. Our average session duration is only 24 seconds, with an average page view per visitor at 1.18 and a bounce rate of 91. p  pI dont doubt the session average time. Me and my coworkers are just a little confused as to how with that many visitors, we are consistently across the board getting such a fairly small session duration and a high bounce rate. Could visitors possibly just come to our website, look for our phone number and than leave the site Im just trying to find a way to reduce the bounce rate and hopefully increase the session duration average. Or is it possible to add a filter that will exclude visits to the site that are less than 30 seconds, or something like that I apologize for asking such fairly basic questions Im sure. I am trying to get up to speed and familiarize myself with how this all works. Just thought Id maybe ask and see if I am missing something important. Any advice would be greatly appreciated.

Negative 36252 pHey hopefully a simple question, roughly How to optimize.  I have a game with exactly 5 characters on the screen, randomly selected from a bank of about 50.  They are relatively high resolution about 300 wide, 600 tall, so each one requires its own 1024x1024 sprite sheet or possibly 4 together on a 2048x2048.p  pThe big questions are...p  p1 Should I preload ALL 50 sprite sheets, or cache them as I need them as the player goes through levelsp  p2 Should each character build its own set of animations inside the character class itself, or should ALL animations be stored in the main HelloWorldp  p3 Should I put 4 sprites on a 2048x2048 sprite sheet when I may only need 1 of the four in a particular level vs having individual 1024x1024 sheetsp  pas a subnote for game flow, a level takes about 1 minute, and its possible to have multiple of the same character, though just based on odds, its typically 5 different characters.p  pThanksp

The function will first create the table, and then create an arbitrary model by using the newly created table. Finally, the newly created model will be used to save. Notice that the save method is used without any parameters and the newly created table has very few fields. These are all intended and the desired result is just the insertion of a new row into the table provided to the function.p  pWhen I run this code, I get the following messagep  blockquote   pTable randomTableName for model randomModelName was not found in   datasource default.p blockquote  pWhen I check my database, the table is there. It is created and it strongexistsstrong for sure. Then, I refresh the page and get the same error. When I refresh the page a couple more times, the error is gone and the insertion is completed, which suggests that something happens in the background and magically the tables existence is recognized. The table has been there the whole time for sure. But somehow cakephp does not recognize its existence until a couple of refreshes and some background magic. Im thinking this is some sort of a caching problem but I have no idea how to deal with it.p  pWhat do I do so that the insertion is done immediately after the creation of the tablep

It doesnt matter if you get the center, I just want to know how to get a relative value of codesquareOnecodes position while its moving.p
Negative 36252 pI have a class whose declaration is getting too bloated for a single header file.  I nest classes and structures within it to reinforce their relationship together, so Id like to keep them together in the sense that I must use the outermost classs namespace to use the classes within p  pIs there a way to declare nested classes from another header file  Or perhaps at least declare the methods of the nested class in another header file many methods per class is the reason for the bloat, the number of classes is relatively reasonable at 10p  pThe structure looks a bit like thisp  precodeclass Stage     class Quad         Quad         Quadint width, int height          like 20 different constructors, plus methods     private          glmvec3 p[4]          class Line           ...           and a bunch of other classes       Stage methods     void drawQuad quad     void drawLine line      ...  codepre  pI should probably add, I cant expand them inline with the preprocessor, since that messes up my IDEs code completion if I get creative with it.p

Negative 36252 pI have a kendo dropdownlist and a template in it that contains a textbox, but I find the existing dropdownlist events interfere with the textbox.p  pA pretty rough, yet fully functional, fiddle a hrefhttpdojo.telerik.comAripU relnofollowhereap  pIf you click on the edit image, you get a textbox but you are unable to click into it. I have managed to focus but the click is still being ignored. p  pBecause the kendo dropdownlist has a mousedown event that handles the focus, when I click on the textbox nothing happens. I can however grab the click event with x,y coordinates.p  pIs there a way I can use those x,y coordinates in order to set the caret position I have seen examples with select and with setSelectionRange but I do not wish to select the text, just to set the cursor position at the point of the click. Also the only info I can grab is the x,y coordinates, not the length of the string at the point of click.p  pAny help is appreciatedp

Negative 36252 pI am attempting to use CSS Flexbox display flex to take up the remaining height of a window. I also want scrolling available... Maybe I have been going about this wrong, but have been looking for so long that other options have eluded me.p  pThe idea is that there is a fixed container. Within that fixed container is a flexbox that takes up 100 of the height. I add items to the flex box that stack in a column. The last item I add containerwrapper has dynamic content inside that will replace HTML through AJAX calls else I would just move the actionbar outside the wrapper and be done with it. This content wrapper is also a flex container as well as a flex item and set to grow and shrink with the height of the window. The last item of this flex container is supposed to allow scrolling as the window shrinks.p  pa hrefhttpjsfiddle.netnokowkng9 relnofollowDemo herea.p  precodelt The fixed container gt ltdiv classfixedgt     lt The first flex container  direction column gt     ltdiv classoutergt         ltdiv classsomeflexitemgtltdivgt         ltdiv classsomeflexitemgtltdivgt         lt Grow and shrink with 100 of height gt         ltdiv classcontainerwrappergt             lt inner HTML is dynamic gt             lt flex 0 0 auto gt             ltdiv classactionbargtltdivgt              lt Want this div to take up remaining height of window                  and have overflowy scrolling gt             ltdiv classcontainergt                 ...             ltdivgt         ltdivgt     ltdivgt ltdivgt codepre  pSeems to work in IE 10, Chrome, but Firefox doesnt add the scrollbar because containerwrappers height grows unbounded due to the content inside. I should mention that an older version of Firefox displayed correctly I think 33, but updated versions do not.p  pI found a workaround where I make inner container position relative and then wrap the inner contents of that in a div with absolute positioning set to 0 for top, left, bottom, right. a hrefhttpjsfiddle.netnokowkng10 relnofollowExample herea.

Negative 36252 pIve been experimenting with Stanford NLP toolkit and its lemmatization capabilities. I am surprised how it lemmatize some words. For examplep  precodedepressing gt depressing depressed gt depressed depresses gt depress codepre  pIt is not able to transform codedepressingcode and codedepressedcode into the same lemma. Simmilar happens with codeconfusingcode and codeconfusedcode, codehopelesslycode and codehopelesscode. I am getting the feeling that the only thing it is able to do is remove the codescode if the word is in such form e.g. codefeels gt feelcode. Is such behaviour normal for Lematizatiors in English I would expect that they would be able to transform such variations of common words into a same lemma.p  pIf this is normal, should I rather use stemmers And, is there a way to use stemmers like Porter Snowball, etc. in StanfordNLP There is no mention of stemmers in their documentation however, there are some codeCoreAnnotations.StemAnnotationcode in the API. If not possible with StanfordNLP which stemmers do you recommend for use in Javap

Ive been thinking of introducing a default value which would be technically acceptable when defining the field mappings but what about values being returned as 0.00 when it should be an empty string, and what about values that should be 1,2,3 being returned as 1.00, 2.00, etc...p  pSo Im hoping someone will know how to fix this at the query level rather than having to put dodgy workaround via code.p  pThanks.p  h1UPDATEh1  pHeres my full query if it helpsp  precodeSELECT PURCHASELEDGER.ACCOUNTREF AS SupplierCode,         PURCHASELEDGER.NAME AS SupplierName,         PURCHASELEDGER.ADDRESS1,         PURCHASELEDGER.ADDRESS2,         PURCHASELEDGER.ADDRESS3,         PURCHASELEDGER.ADDRESS4,         PURCHASELEDGER.ADDRESS5,        London AS City,        COUNTRYCODE.Name AS Country,          AS PostCode,         AS PostCode1,        PURCHASELEDGER.VATREGNUMBER AS TaxRegistrationNumber,         10 AS CorporateGroupId,        COUNTRYCODE.Name AS Location,         CURRENCY.CODE AS CurrencyCode   FROM PURCHASELEDGER         INNER JOIN CURRENCY ON PURCHASELEDGER.CURRENCY  CURRENCY.NUMBER         INNER JOIN COUNTRYCODE ON PURCHASELEDGER.COUNTRYCODE  COUNTRYCODE.CODE codepre  ol liCity will throw an error i.e. Column not found li liPostCode will cause the rest of the fields not to be returned li liPostCode1 will return 0.00 instead of  li liOrganizationNumber will return 10.00 instead of 10li ol

Negative 36252 pI have two labels emtitleem and emdescriptionem. They should be sided by sidep  precode   title    description    codepre  pDepending on the content of the two labels the maximum width of the line should be used, whereas one label is the master label and is always shown. The behavior should be as followsp  precodeTitle Description TitleTitleTitleTitleTitle Description TitleTitleTitleTitleTitleTitle Descr TitleTitleTitleTitleTitleTitleTitleT Title DescriptionDescription Title DescriptionDescriptionDescript codepre  pThere are a few cases   p  ol liTitle label expands and moves description label to the side.li liOnce the title label is expanded enough, the title label gets abbreviated and the description label should hide.li liWhen the title label doesnt contain much text, the description label can expand. The description label expands until it reaches the end of the view and then gets abbreviated.li ol  pThe question is how should the constraint does look likep  pemtitleem label  p  ul lileft constraint parentli licenter Y constraint parentli liwidth constraint lt parent width, abbreviates the labelli licompression resistance 750li ul  pemdescriptionem label  p  ul lileft constraint title label rightli licenter Y constraint title labelli liright constraint parentli licompression resistance 250li ul  pThis is what I have now. But it doesnt work as described above. The right constraint on the description label is problematic, because only with it the label gets abbreviated. Using it pins the label always to the right if the title label gets shorter. I tried it with priorities but its either or. Also the hiding of the description label is not implemented only if I dont have the right constraint for the description label it will exceed the codeUIWindowcode and then disappears.p  pI dont think its possible to hide the description label with auto layout. Only calculating the width and hiding it manually will do it I think.p  pstrongPictures and sourcestrongp  pToo make it clearer what I want Ive made some pictures demonstrating the problem.p  precode 1 both short titleLabel.Text  Lorem ipsum descLabel.Text  Anything codepre  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comCIspx.png altboth shortp  pThe result is wrong because the description label is too far left.

I believe codefgetscode should read each line individually until it sees a EOF character p  pNow, I had this section working before I added the directory stuff, where I was just opening one file by using codefopencode with its full path name, and I havent touched it.

Negative 36252 pI have an application instance, backed by a web service using OIM Webservices Connector.p  pThis connector is used in a synchronous manner by OIM, so when I create a new account in OIM for this application instance, the webservice calls the partner links method.p  pUntil the method ends its execution, the OIM screen hangs as expected.p  pWhat seems strange to me is that, no matter the partner links method executes successfully or not when it does not execute properly, it throws an exception, the OIM operation actually ignores the exception and completes the operation.p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.com8dSLf.png altenter image description herep  pEven if I explicitly throw an exception in the BPEL, I can see the error in the webservice log in weblogic, but the OIM method completes anyway.p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comXMr6x.png altenter image description here img srchttpi.stack.imgur.comM93b8.png altenter image description herep  pWhat one would expect from a situation like this, I guess, is that OIM could just give an error message on the screen, because the operation failed.

Negative 36252 pI am trying to write something that would access methods I have written in a WPF c application, from a vba worksheet, an intermediary would be acceptable, as well as any command line solution, as long as I can run this intermediary from excel where the data I need to send will be kept. p  pDoes anyone know any decent solutions for sending data to a c without registering the dll, and preferably in a portable way that I can move to other machines easilyp  pAny help in that matter would be greatly appreciated, I am looking for pointers in the right direction as a COM solution is not viable right now. p  pCheers.p
Negative 36252 pI dont want to create a validator, rather I want to listen for any validation errors so that I can do something special. p  pSo for example lets say I have a codeDateFieldcode and the user enters invalid date, I want to have a codelistenercode that will be notified at the same time as the field is highlighted in red by Vaadin. I looked everywhere I could and could not find any kind of Validation codeListenercode or error notification mechanism. I can create my own custom validators, but thats not what I want to do. I want to be notified of validation errors from fields like codeDateFieldcode which already have their own builtin validators. There must be some way because some kind of listener has to be notified to change the css values for the field as well as add the question mark in the caption...p

Negative 36252 pMy problem specifically is that I would like to be able to create dynamic templates, depending on the type of item contained in a certain record.

Negative 36252 pIm on a bit of a fools journey, but ultimately I wish to answer a hrefhttpsprojecteuler.netproblem37 relnofollowthisa question in a single line of python yes, I know it can be done much simpler than this. I ran across the concept of the Ycombinator a hrefhttpstackoverflow.coma185066253220135herea to recursively solve for the next truncatable prime without overflowing the recursion limit, and I have solved it in three lines of code spoiler alertp  precodeout  lambda f lambda x xxlambda y flambda args lambda yyargslambda flambda l,n l if lenl  11 else fl[n],n2 if lambda n n not in2,3,5,7and all[y1 andy2 or y20and not any[yi0 for i in range3,1inty.5,2]for y in[intstrn[x1]for x in rangelenstrn]]and all[y1 andy2 or y20and not any[yi0 for i in range3,1inty.5,2]for y in[intstrn[x]for x in rangelenstrn]]n else fl,n2[],1 while callableout out  out printsumout codepre  pdont worry about the first line, because it is largely irrelevant. My main question is how would one go about calling the while loop as a lambda expression so that a new stack frame is not created each time else recursion limit is reached. basically the garbage line at the top returns a function that will keep returning functions as it is called until the computation is complete at which point it will return a list. an alternative while loop might look like thisp  precodewhile typeout  list out  out codepre

Negative 36252 pI am writing a 3D engine in Python using Pygame. For the first 300 or so frames, it takes from about 0.004 to 0.006 seconds to render 140 polygons. But after that, it suddenly takes an average of about 0.020 seconds to do the same task. This is concerning to me because this is a smallscale test, and even though 50 FPS is decent, it cannot be sustained at 1000 polygons, for instance.p  pI have already done a lot of streamlining to my code. I have also done some slightly deeper profiling, and it appears that the increased time is more or less proportionately distributed, which suggests that the problem is not specific to a single piece of code.p  pI assume that the problem has something to do with memory usage, but I do not know exactly why this problem is happening. What specific issue is causing this to happen, and how can I optimize my code to fix it, as well as some more general practices Since my code is very long, it is posted a hrefhttpwww.devtano.comsoftwarewinkelmanpygame3d relnofollowherea.p

Of course I can attempt to retrieve it each time I need to use the variable but this is not elegant. p  pstrongUpdatestrongp  pA potential solution has been proposed as followsp  precodepublic static String email  null static      email  awesomeemail.com  change to your initialization process  codepre  pI thought this solution would work however the problem is that the value is generated dynamically at startup if a previous value does not already exist in the txt file. Basically, if it is the 1st time you are running the application a new value is generated. Otherwise the value is retrieved from a txt file which was generated at a previous run of the program.p  pIf I implement this solution the value of email will be equal to null across the entire program if this is the first time you run the program.p  pI basically need a way to initialize a static variable using a conditional statement but I dont know if this is possible.  p  pThanksp

Negative 36252 pIm working on a clientserver application built with angularJS. For data exchanges Im using HTML5 WebSockets. My server has a dataset that also exists as copy on my client. I refer to this as my model as here is all the raw data.p  pVia WebSockets Im able to getset those data. There may also be random data updates from the server push.p  pIm using different custom servicesfactories to provide a layer that allows all my modules to create data packets and send them to my server. They also provide wrapper for my model and may change the reprasentation of this data in the view like timestamps converted to real time, etc.. I have different controllers that access those services to reach for functions or values.p  pI hope this describes my current architecture good enough. Now my questionp  pOn data updates from the server I update my model data and then inform all modules that make use of this data with the new value. Its likep  precodeServer gt Model gt ViewModel gt View codepre  pThat works fine and I guess its ok from the view of the MVVM pattern.p  pBut Im struggling a bit with publishing updates from the view. At the moment its likep  precodeView gt ViewModel gt Model at first update the model                          gt Server after that send the data to the server codepre  pSo, when theres a user updating data in the view, the viewmodel gets updated via angulars data binding. Then the viewmodel calls a service to create an output packet that will be sent to the server. When the packets gets commited my model will be updated with the new data and the packet will be given over to my websocket connection, updating the data on the server.p  pstrongIs this theone right way to do so Is it ok to update my model even before the packet is sent to the server Should I send the update to the server, wait for an OK and only then update the modelstrongp

Negative 36252 pI am writing a library for multiprecision arithmetic based on a paper I am reading. It is very important that I am able to guarantee the properties of floating point numbers I use. In particular, that they adhere to the IEEE 754 standard for double precision floating point numbers. Clearly I cannot guarantee the behavior of my code on an unexpected platform, but for x86 and x64 chipsets, which I am writing for, I am concerned about a particular hazard. Apparently, some or all x86  x64 chipsets may make use of extended precision floating point numbers in their FPU registers, with 80 bits of precision. I cannot tolerate my arithmetic being handled in extended precision FPUs without being rounded to double precision after every operation because the proofs of correctness for the algorithms I am using rely on rounding to occur. I can easily identify cases in which extended precision could break these algorithms.p  pI am writing my code in C. How can I guarantee certain values are rounded In C, I would declare variables as volatile, forcing them to be written back to RAM. This is slow and Id rather keep the numbers in registers as 64 bit floats, but correctness in these algorithms is the whole point, not speed. In any case, I need a solution for C. If this seems infeasible I will approach the problem in a different language.p

Negative 36252 pI would like to give a user the option to display data in an HTML table or a DataTAble.  I have a select dropdown that I am populating with a query output.  After the user selects an option from the list they would select one of two radio buttons 1 view HTML table, or 2 view DataTable.  The user selects one of these radio buttons and then clicks on the submit button to display the results on a new page.   The new page receives the form.value and inserts this into the query to produce the HTML table or DataTable.  p  pIm new to ColdFusion.  It seems easier assign an action page to each radio button selection.  I have made some attempt but nothing working yet.  Im guessing this may be a trivial task, but any help would be appreciated.p  pSo on the form you would have your select dropdown and inputp  precodeltselect nameSpecies classdropdowngt ltcfoutput queryspeciesgt ltoption valuespecies.Speciesgtspecies.GenusSpeciesltoptiongt ltcfoutputgt ltselectgt      ltinput typeradio nameSpecies valueDataTablegt DataTable ltinput typeradio nameSpecies valueHTML checkedcheckedgt HTML Table ltinput typesubmit valueSubmit classbuttonsgtltinputgt codepre  pHow do I assign something to a radio button and then execute with submit  cfparam or cflocationp  pThanks.p

Negative 36252 pI have looked at many different AngularJS file uploads and also looked at Django Rest API with uploading. None them seem to have the functionality for my particular use casep  pThe uploader requirements is upon upload to show an image preview in the page. In the back a thumbnail is generated, and this is image is displayed on the frontend NOT the actual image.p  pBUT when the user decides to select a second image, this second imageits thumbnail actually should take the place of the first uploaded image, in terms of preview on the frontend, and etc for the next uploading after the second one.p  pSo only one image, the current one uploaded will be displayed.p  pThe examples online that i have found, they allow all images uploaded to be displayed. This is not the functionality for my app.p  pI hope someone out there either knows of an open source project out there already or can guide me on how to go about this.p  pRegards,p  pPp

Negative 36252 pMy Angular app would be consisted of 2 HTML, 1 controller.js, 1 service.js and 1 state.js. In first html file I have one button. I want on click on the button to transferred to state getExam in state.js, in which the controller would be called with a method getOldestExam, and from that method the service getOldestExam.  First I tried with ngClick, and it is transferring me to getOldestExam controller ok, but the problem I have is that I want the result from the controller to be printed in the second HTMLthe scope of the result to not be lost  I tried a second solution instead of using ng.click I am using uisrefexamuuid, that is changing the state fine in which is the second HTML called, but I cannot call the controller from the State successfully Can someone suggest me a correct approach or solutionp
