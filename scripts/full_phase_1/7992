Positive 7992 pI am working on a spreadsheet that is performing calculations on very small numbers, on the order of 1E14. I had a draft of my process that leverages the spreadsheet and does not store any data in VBA variables.

I am working with Excel 2013 p  precodeAn example in a cell  B42COS2PIE41A42   or if I plug in values taking all figures reported i get the following  0.156434465Cos23.141592653589790.0120.05   this results in  1.56433353400222E01 codepre  pIf I do the same thing in VBA p  precodegsum  Rounddatai  1, 1, 10  Cos2  pi  Freq  i  dt  or  0.156434465Cos23.141592653589790.01210.05  i get a different answer  WatchRounddatai  1, 1, 10  Cos2  Pi  Freq  i  dt     0.156433353359992  VariantDouble  Calculation.realFT codepre  pI am not sure how to combat this.

However, is there a reason why this would work in an assignment operator First I assumed that behind the scenes, the codeshortcodes are casted to codeintcode, but then you would have an assignmentreturn value codeshort value  some intcode, which should yield an error since the cast is not implicit.p  pemOn a different noteem I tried out some code in Visual Studios immediate window, but there, a lot more code seems to work. The immediate window probably does some implicit casting which would usually be explicit. E.g., codeshort a  int5code is allowed in the immediate window. So thats not helping.p

Negative 7992 pHow to enable innodb support on installed instance of MySqlp  pI have installed mysql5.0.67win32. InnoDB is DISABLED when executing show engines. According to documentation MySql is compiled with support of innodb From doc A value of DISABLED occurs either because the server was started with an option that disables the engine, or because not all options required to enable it were given.p  pIn my.ini I commented line with skipinnodb. This didnt help. All other innodb related variables remain unchanged.p  pI have performed some unusual action before I experienced described situation. I have mysql4.0.17win installed.

When I tried to reinstall with support of innodb I had problems of using my previous database mysql with account information.p  pMySQL documentation says that I should use mysqldump to export data and after this to import exported data in process of upgrade. I tried to do so, but when importing data I obtained message about syntax error I think that it is connected with some incompatibilities of 4th and 5th version of mysqlp

Negative 7992 pFor an ajax app Im doing, I was using the google local search api to help enter in address info. For example, if the user needs to fill out employment information, typing in the business name would provide a list of matching businesses, then clicking one would fill out all of the address fields. However, we cant use it because of the restrictions on googles api. We have a closed https app which just makes it out of the question.p  pBecause of the https requirement, we have to use the server as a proxy which means a pretty lenient usage restriction. That makes Bing a good choice. The REST api seems like a great way to go, and it works well enough, but with one problem. The center point location needs to be specified as a latitude and longitude. Users will be supplying the information in a zipcode or citystate format. This clearly means geocoding. What is the best route to take Is there a good way to get around geocoding that Im missing Looking at the Bing APIs, it appears that geocoding is offered as a SOAP web service that costs money. If Im doing that should I just use google maps for geocoding  theres an enterprise version of maps with https Any other suggestionsp  pI am using Java on the server and obviously javascript on the front end.

Negative 7992 pi am looking for new features and ideas to improve the overall usability of our internal webapp straight LOBApp with some CRM featuresp  pi bet there is ton of those waiting the get found. as an examplep  precently i tried out rememberthemilk.com a task tracking application which has the feature to enter dates in natural language, so instead of using the date picker or entering the date itself, because grabbing the mouse actually takes longer but forces you to think about what the date is, you can just write today or tomorrow or end of month  or in 2 weeks. that feature really got me, every time i use another application now, i wonder why i cant do this here. i wonder why other application make me thing about what date next friday is. i dont care but i do care that my boss just said i need this till next friday.p  p1 featureidea per answer please.p

Negative 7992 pI have a .NET application with a web frontend, WCF windows service backend. The application is fairly simple  it takes some user input, sending it to the service. The service does this  takes the input excel spreadsheet, extracts the data items, checks SQL db to make sure the items are not already existing  if they do not exist, we make a realtime request to a third party data vendor and retreive the results, inserting them into the database. It does some logging along the way.p  pI have a Job class with a single public ctor and public Run method. The ctor takes all the params, and the Run method does all of the above logic. Each logical piece of functionality is split into a seperate class  IParser does file parsing, IConnection does the interaction with the data vendor, IDataAccess does the data access, etc. The Job class has private instances of these interfaces, and uses DI to construct the actual implementations by default, but allows the class user to inject any interface.p  pIn the real code, I use the default ctor. In my unit tests for the Run method, I use all mock objects creating via NMock2.0. This Run method is essentially the top level function of this application.p  pstrongNow heres my issue  questionstrong  the unit tests for this Run method are crazy. I have 3 mock objects im sending into the ctor, and each mock object sets expectations on themselves. At the end I verify. I have a few different flows that the Run method can take, each flow having its own test  it could find everythings already in the database and not make a request to vendor... or an exception could be thrown and the job status could be set to failed.. OR we can have the case where we didnt have the data and needed to make the vendor request so all those function calls would need to be made.p  pNow  before you yell at me and say your Run method is too complicated  this Run method is only a mere 50 lines of code It does make calls to some private function but the entire class is only 160 lines. Since all the real logic is being done in the interfaces that are declared on this class. stronghoweveer, the biggest unit test on this function is 80 lines of code, with 13 calls to Expect.BLAH.. strongp  pThis makes refactoring a huge pain. If I want to change this Run method around, I have to go edit my 3 unit tests and addremoveupdate Expect calls. When I need to refactor, I end up spending more time creating my mock calls then I did actually writing the new code. And doing real TDD on this function makes it even more difficult if not impossible. Its making me think that its not even worth unit testing this top level function at all, since really this class isnt doing much logic, its just passing around data to its composite objects which are all fully unit tested and dont require mocking.p  pSo  should I even bother testing this high level function And what am I gainging by doing this Or am I completely misusing mockstub objects here Perhaps I should scrap the unit tests on this class, and instead just make an automated integration test, which uses the real implementations of the objects and Asserts against SQL Queries to make sure the right endstate data exists What am I missing herep  pThanks very much for any helpp  pEDIT a hrefhttppastebin.comm7f7c2116 relnofollowHeres the codea  the first function is the actual Run method  then my 5 tests which test all 5 possible code paths. I changed it some  for NDA reasons but the general concept is still there. strongemAnything you see wrong with how Im testing this function, any suggestions on what to change to make it betteremstrong Thanks.p

Negative 7992 pWell, Im trying to make ASP.NET urls looking userfriendly, like it was explained a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions2003840makeurlinaspnetuserfriendlyin this questiona. So I created an ASP.Net form, and placed codeasptextboxcode and codeaspbuttoncode on it. Also I set codeonclientclickcode attribute to call JS function which navigates to smart URL by setting codewindows.location.hrefcode. In Firefox it works well but in IE and Opera the browser first navigates to smart url but then it closes connection and sends a postback using an asp.net form action.p  pI tried to solve it using html button instead of server ones. It works, but the problem is that it cant be set as default for the asp.net form. So if user clicks on it, it does its work. But if the user just presses enter when form is active, the form performs its action, so the button is not pressed and JS url rewriting doesnt occur. So how can I solve this problemp  pMy JS looks like thisp  precodefunction searchRedirect      var query  getcolSearch     window.location.href  colSearchq  query.value     return false  codepre  pand in search.aspx i havep  precodeltform idMainForm runatserver methodgetgt         ltaspTextBox idcolSearch runatserver Width615px CssClasssearchLinegtltaspTextBoxgt         ltinput idButton1 typebutton valueSearch onclicksearchRedirect classsearch gt codepre  pI also tried with codeaspbuttoncodep  precodeltform idMainForm runatserver methodget defaultbuttonsubmitReqBtngt         ltaspTextBox idcolSearch runatserver Width615px CssClasssearchLinegtltaspTextBoxgt         ltaspButton runatserver TextSearch IDsubmirReqBtn              onclientclicksearchRedirect CausesValidationFalse              EnableViewStateFalse UseSubmitBehaviorFalsegtltaspButtongt ltformgt codepre
Negative 7992 pThis might be a way too generic question, but what is the general approach for seeking within media files video or audio of any kindformat if the data has variable bitrate VBRp  pIt seems an easy thing to do if the stream has a constant bitrate CBR. E.g. if you know it is 256 kbits and you want to seek forwardbackward by 30 seconds, just calculate how many bits that are approximately, convert that to byte and seek that many byte forwardsbackwards in the file. Finally keep on reading and parsing till the next headerblockstartkeyframewhatever is found and continue playback from there.p  pOkay, but what do you do if the bitrate is highly variable E.g. it can be anything from 32 to 512 kbits and keeps changing frequently I know that this might depend on audiovideo format. Some file formats have index tables at the beginningend you might use and some files contain pointers in the stream how many bytes to skip for skipping the next X seconds. In that case you can work with that information, however, what if the format has no such table or pointersp  pThe most naive approach I can think of is to just estimate the bitrate as good as possible e.g. by looking at the average bitrate of the last couple of seconds you played back, jumping where you think it could be correct according to the estimated bitrate, and look how far you really jumped. If you jumped too much, try jumping back a bit. If you jumped too little, try jumping forward a bit. Maybe keep jumping in one direction till you jumped too far again, now reverse the direction again as well as the step size similar to a binary search algorithm. Each time you jumped too far, you reverse the direction and decrease the step size. You will get closer and closer to the correct point and if you are close enough below some chosen delta, just start playing again after all the jump doesnt have to be accurate to the millisecond.p  pWhile the algorithm above might work, it sounds rather poor and is probably very slow in practice. So how is it really done Anyone ever wrote a media playerplayerplugin of some kind Or is it just like this that every decent format supporting VBR must have some kind of index tables or skip pointers in the stream if it expects software to correctly seek and not just play from start to endp

Negative 7992 pI am trying to use jQupload to upload an image asynchronously. The script uses an iframe off of the page to upload and then catches the .load event of the iframe to return the JSON message that is returned.p  pIf I display the form at the bottom of a standard HTML page and include the javascript then it works fine.

Negative 7992 pI have been studying internals of Java for quite some time. I am curious to learn and understand how threadinglocking takes place in Java. p  pSo, in order to access a synchronized method or a synchronized block, the thread has to acquire the lock on the object first. So, now, here is what I need a bit more light.p  pSo, whenever the thread acquires the lock on the object, does it increment the value of the semaphore internally If the answer is yes then lets take a look at this scenario.p  precodeclass ABC       public void method1         synchronizedxyz             ....                    public void method2         ...         synchronizedxyz             ....                codepre  pSo, say there are two threads Threaad 1 and Thread 2. Assuming, strongThread1strong entered method1 first and therefore acquired a lock on xyz first. And, say now, strongThread2strong enters method2 and tries to acquire lock on xyz. What will happen Acc to me, Thread2 will get blocked since it finds that the objects semaphore value0p  pLet me know if my reasoning is correct.p

They both appear to work emcorrectlyem its just that our original implementation seems to be much faster.p  pMy questionp  ol liWhy would this be Is it perhaps because codeBlockingCollectionltTgtcode offers greater flexibility I understand it works by wrapping an codeIProducerConsumerCollectionltTgtcode, which necessarily introduces performance overheadli liIs this just a flatout misguided use of the codeBlockingCollectionltTgtcode classli liIf this is an appropriate use of codeBlockingCollectionltTgtcode, am I just not using properly For example, is the codeTakecodecodeAddcode approach overly simplistic, and theres a far betterperforming way to get the same functionalityli ol  pUnless anyone has some insight to offer in response to that third question, it looks like well be sticking with our original implementation for now.p

Negative 7992 pIm working on maintenance of an application that transfers a file to another system and uses a structured filename to include meta data including a language code.  The current app uses a two character language code and a dashhyphen for a delimiter.p  pEx. CanadaENProdNameProdCode.txtp  pIm converting it to use IETF language code and so the dash delimiter wont do and need a replacement.  Im trying to determine a delimiter to avoid future errors and am considering the tilde .  p  pEx. CanadaenGBProdNameProdCode.txtp  pThis will be use only on Windows Sever 2003  systems.  I certainly didnt come up with this system of parsing a filename to get meta data.  Unfortunately, I cant include this in the file itself and the destination system is expecting the language code to be in IETF format with the dash.  p  pAny thoughts on potential issues with using the tilde in the filename, or perhaps a better character to use  Im just looking for a second opinion in case Im overlooking a possible failure.  I believe windows will use the tilde when shortening a long filename to 8.3 format, but I dont see that as an issue here as the OSs can handle lang filenames.p

Negative 7992 pIve hit a bit of a dead end in trying to figure this one out... Using the MVVM pattern in WPF, our C Model fires an event to say something has happened.

This has to be handled with no Code Behind.p  pI can sync for the event in my ViewModel, update a property to say what the name of that event is and fire a NotifyPropertyChanged even but how do I get that to either kick off a storyboard or map to a boolean truefalse on the Visibility property of my Grid The property I bind to hs to be the event name as different grids may be shown based on different events so I need a way of mapping this to a boolean.

Negative 7992 pIn the game our Internetassembled team is programming, were assuming everybody from our audience will have WAY over fullspeed in the game.p  pSo, to save video RAM, and hopefully give a little more idle time to the graphics card, using Vsync without double buffering would be our best option. So, in OpenGL, we need to know how to do that.p  pFrom my understanding, Vsync is when the graphics card is paused once its done rendering a single frame until that frame has finished being sent to the display device. Double buffering doesnt pause render operations or maybe it does, or maybe its implementationspecific not sure, because it instead draws to a second buffer before copying to the framebuffer, so that the monitor either gets the full frame or no new frame at all specifically, the last stored image in the framebuffer. Well, we dont need that feature, as long as the graphics card just writes to the framebuffer ONLY when it damn needs to.p  pThis is a pretty slow online game But its VERY creative . Theres very little realtime action. Therefore, extremely precise user input is not a necessity it can be captured from the OS as a single unit any time before rendering a frame.p  pSo, in order to do EXACTLY this, I need to be able to get a Frame has finished sending to monitor message from OpenGL. Is it possible If not, what is the best alternativep  pThe game is being programmed for Windows only at the moment but should have work done for Linux in a few months.p

Negative 7992 pI have a PHP SOAP web service, using CakePHP, which is returning a variable amount of data back to clients. The amount of data returned can be very little, or huge   10MB but lt 100MB. p  pThe problem Im having is that with larger responses usually greater than 5 MB, the application runs out of memory and things come crashing down. The first thing Ive tried changing is using raw SQL queries rather than Cakes data access level. This way, when I retrieve 10,000 records from the database, Cake wont try to keep it all in memory. p  pThat has worked really well, although its a bad convention. The bigger problem however, is once I have the results, it still runs out of memory transmitting the response. Im not sure if this is happening when the SoapServer compiles the response, or if the client runs out of memory storing the response, or if it runs out of memory just serializingrendering the data on the screen. p  pIn any case, it seems like if there were some way to stream the SOAP response back to the client, everything would work a lot better. No matter what the issue is, the data could be broken down into manageable chunks. I dont know how to do this in PHP though, or if its even possible. p  pPlease advise.p
Negative 7992 pI am looking for ideas on how to deal with a search related task which takes more than usual time in human terms more than 3 secondsp  pI have to query multiple sources, sift through information for the first time and then cache it in the DB for later quick return.p  pThe context of the project is J2EE, Spring and Hibernate on top of SpringROOp  pThe possible solutions I could think of  On the webpage let the user know that task is running in background, if possible give them a queue number or waiting time. Refresh the page via a controller which basically checks if the task is done, then when its done ie the search result is prepared and stored in DB then just forward to a new controller and fetch the result from the DBp  pThe background tasks could be done with Spring Task executor. I am not sure if it is easy to give a measure of how long it would take. It would probably be a bad idea to let all the search terms run concurrently, so some sort of pooling will be a good idea.p  pAnother option to use background tasks is to use JMS. This is perhaps a solution with more control retries etcp  pSpring batch also comes to mindp  pPlease suggest how you would do it. I would greatly appreciate a semidetailed description. The sources of info can be man and can be sequential in nature so it can take upto 45 minutes for the results to form. It is also possible that such tasks run automatically in the background without user intervention ie to update from the sourcesp

Negative 7992 pI read the a hrefhttpzguide.zeromq.orgpage3aallZeroMq guidea and I stumbled upon the followingp  blockquote   pYou MUST NOT share MQ sockets between   threads.

Negative 7992 pI am having multiple issues trying to localize an app with xcode 4.0.2.  This app was coded initially with previous version, but since I installed the 4.0.2 everything more or less has worked, except localization. I have about 10 pngs that load in 10 different xibs via UIImageView using Interface Builder. These pngs are correctly localized, inside the es.lproj folder the spanish ones and in the en.lproj folder the english ones.  The weird thing is that even inside xcode, when I open the xib file, it sometimes shows the english version and sometimes the spanish.  The xibs are not localized, because there is nothing more to localize in there, just that UIImageView with the pngs.p  pIs it not possible to localize just the pngsp  pDoes anyone know if this issues respond to known bugsp  pThis pngs are named text1.png, text2.png, text3.png ... Could it be something related to the serialized namingp

Negative 7992 pI have a messy situation wrapping a couple of 3rd party COM components. Actually its one COM component and several .NET assemblies.

Negative 7992 pI finally got back to fleshing out a GitCommit message mode that I want to add to YI but I seem to missing something basic.  I cant seem to match a single character in a grammar, all my rules only work if they match the entire line.  I know this has to be possible because other grammars in YI obviously do this but doing the same thing doesnt seem to work.p  pI want to have a commit mode that eventually looks very similar to the one in vim.  One of the things thats useful in vims mode is the keyword highlighting inside comments.  Git puts a bunch of information inside comments in most everything it does commit, rebase, etc. so this is useful.  My thinking was match the starting  character in git comments and switch to a different context that will match keywords.  However I cant seem to make a rule that matches emjustem the , the rule switches to comment style on lines that emonlyem contain a  but on lines that contain anything after the  it does not switch styles.p  pWhat I have right now isp  precodelt0gt                                m const  LineComment Style.commentStyle  commitChars                  c Style.defaultStyle    ltlineCommentgt                                                                                                      nl                             m const Digest Style.defaultStyle                                                                                c Style.regexStyle                                                                         codepre  pp  pDetails omitted obviously.

Negative 7992 pI am analyzing whether using dynamic script tags to do requests to some third party servers is a good idea. Stackoverflow and a few other site had a couple of topics about these and Im still left unsure that its a good idea.p  pApp is on server B. Third party API is on server A.p  pIf server B application is pulling server As javascript API library, which in turn uses dynamic  tags to make calls to server A, I am guessing that the API library and the returning code from the API itself is still within server Bs domain sandbox p  pThere are a couple of things Im thinking of as wellp  pI am also evaluating whether its more advisable to actually pull the library code to server B, vet it for security, host the JS source ourselves so that we dont blindly accept it just in case it changes over time.p  pIn addition to that, I would make changes to server As API library to make calls via our proxy, which would whitelist domains along with logging every request long with a couple of other things, like making sure that only json and valid json is returned back to the client ...p  pObviously I would like to avoid having to deal with this hot potato issue, but the decision to use this API has so far overriden my substantiated or not security worries.p  pIs there literature that holds weight that supports either sidep

Negative 7992 pAfter years of experimentation with editors, the fact is I prefer them as minimal as possible. I never use fancy features and the fullfeature IDEs become bloated, heavy, and slow. Of course, when I do something that pretty much requires a specific IDE like Android dev and Eclipse I have no problems using it. But most of the time, I use gedit for programming.p  pHowever, I like many Emacs commands, and I want to use them occasionally. Is there a way to embed Emacs inside of gedit For instance, I envision pressing altq or whatever combo and Emacs mode is enabled, and from then on all my key presses in the current tab do Emacs commands. I press altq again, and it turns off. This would allow me the best of both worlds. Anything like this exist, or do I need to write this plugin myselfp

Negative 7992 pNot sure how to ask this question so it will makes sense, but let me try. My app opens a  UIViewController, and then calls another one. When it opens the other one it places a variable in a textfield successfully. When the user closes the 2nd UIViewController and returns to the 1st UIViewController, I pass back the variable and place it in a textfield. This is all successful at this point. The variable is being passed back and forth with no problems.p  pSo here is what I am trying to do upon returning to the 1st UIViewController I run a query statement which uses the variable in the textfield as a key to pull a record from a SQLite table. I use the NSLog to check the code and I see that the textfield is empty, but when the UIViewController appears the variable is in the textfield. p  pAre with me so far I hope sop  pI am running the query in the ViewDidLoad. I am thinking that the ViewDidLoad is running before it copies the variable from the 2nd into the textfield.p  pMy main question is should I be running my query statement in the ViewDidLoad or some please else to get the variable in the textfield.  Basically, all I want to do is pull a record based on the value in the textfield upon returning from another UIViewController.p  pThank Youp

Negative 7992 pIm wondering if anyone has an elegant solution for generating days based on a month selected for use in a dropdown.

So for example if the user selected january you would have a dropdown list with values 1  31. The only bit i think might be tricky will be to do with leap years, so it may need to pass in year as well. Any ideas would be most appreciated p

Negative 7992 pI have an abstract class that implements some feature, lets say codeFileFormatcode.  For each file format I want to support, I have a subclass, such as codeZipFileFormatcode or codeTextFileFormatcode.  Some features of a file format are stateful, such as an operation to translate the file into a stream of text.  But some other features have no state, such as the default file extension, or the magic pattern prefix for the files contents.p  pOne way to represent this would be to have an abstract method that can be overridden to provide the propertyp  precodeabstract String getDefaultExtension  ...  String getDefaultExtension  return txt  codepre  pThis works, but there is no way to express the base classs assumptions about this property.  In this case, a client of the codeFileFormatcode API would like to assume that the return value of codegetDefaultExtensioncode never changes over time.  But with an override, there is no way to declare this intent in a subclass or assert the restriction in the base class.p  pAn alternative is to use a member variable.  In that case the value of a formats default extension would be passed to the base class constructor.  But this is not great in that it will take up storage space in every instantiation of our class  in the case of a file extension, all instances will have the same extension.p  pAnother way to go is a codePropertiescode object type solution where you have a structure hold a bag of settings, which could be static or not, but that loses type safety, and API documentation, etc.p  pAny other options or comments  Thanks.p

Negative 7992 pIm porting simple web application written in CodeIgniter to Symfony2 bundle. Im new into Symfony2 and Doctrine and Ive a problem with one SQL query, that I want to rewrite in DQL.

Negative 7992 pHello StackOverflow Hive Mindp  pI am in the process of learning how to use wxPython it make a GUI for an application I am writing. Ive been slogging through that well enough until I noticed that I could not properly make a menu bar. Whatever I am doing wrong is causing my event bindings to be executed upon the running of the program. Here is the code in question. Minor misspellings should be ignored, I am retyping this off of my development machine which is offline so I might miss a key here or there. p  precodedef onDocClick    message  wx.MessageBoxdid it work,Question,wx.YESNO  def onAboutClick    pass  frame  wx.FrameparentNone,titleRVR GUI,size315,490 frame.Show panel  wx.Panelframe,1,size315,490  menubar  wx.MenuBar fileMenu  wx.Menu documentation  fileMenu.Appendwx.IDNEW,Documentation about  fileMenu.Appendwx.IDABOUT,About menuBar.AppendfileMenu,File  frame.SetMenuBarmenubar menubar.Bindwx.EVTMENU,onDocClick,documentation menubar.Bindwx.EVTMENU,onAboutClick,about codepre  pThere is alot more to the GUI than that but the rest of the code works fine so I dont think you need it. Basically what is happening, is that the message box in onDocClick is executed as soon as I run the script that opens the GUI. One I click amy button the rest of the GUI initializes fine and a click on the Documentation menu entry sees absolutly nothin at all happen. I have a feeling I am probobly missing something simple, perhaps wx.EVTMENU is not the right one to use in this situation If that is the case what would the right one to use be Every single tutorial I have seen on wxPython has done it this way without explaination. Honestly I have been appalled at the lack of meaningful documentation for wxPython. The Zetcode tutorials and even the ever helpful Mouse vs Python just seems to glaze right over the fundamentals of how the toolkit works. But I digress and Ive been making do, Ive just been completely befuddled by this. Anyway thanks and I appreciate any responses p  pMichaelp

Negative 7992 pAccording to the official Python documentation for the weakref module the primary use for weak references is to implement caches or mappings holding large objects,.... So, I used a WeakValueDictionary to implement a caching mechanism for a long running function. However, as it turned out, values in the cache never stayed there until they would actually be used again, but needed to be recomputed almost every time. Since there were no strong references between accesses to the values stored in the WeakValueDictionary, the GC got rid of them even though there was absolutely no problem with memory. p  pNow, how am I then supposed to use the weak reference stuff to implement a cache If I keep strong references somewhere explicitly to keep the GC from deleting my weak references, there would be no point using a WeakValueDictionary in the first place. There should probably be some option to the GC that tells it delete everything that has no references at all and everything with weak references only when memory is running out or some threshold is exceeded. Is there something like that Or is there a better strategy for this kind of cachep

In my case, I will directly use Abstraction at the client side and use a string as the constructor parameter to determine what concrete implementer I will use. But this kinda leaves me in a situation where I cant use trywithresourcesAbstraction ab   new RefinedAbstractionimplementorA, because Complier would complain that my abstraction is not a AutoCloseable. It doesnt make sense to put concreteImplementor instance in the trywithresouces block, because its the methods in Abstraction Interface actually wanted here.p  pThe only way to get around this I can think of is that, I can use trycatch with finally block to explicitly close out my Abstraction.implementer instead of trying to use trywithresources.

Negative 7992 pIm running into a problem, I havent experienced before.

Negative 7992 pI use JPA 2 with Hibernate. There are two entity classes, codeCardElementcode and codeIdentityDocumentKindcode. The last one is an inherited entity of the first one. SINGLETABLE inheritance strategy is used.

Negative 7992 pI have a specific Adobe CQ5 5.5 content template that authors will use to create pages.  I want to exclude any page that is created from this template from the dispatcher cache.  As I understand it currently, the only way I know to prevent caching is to configure strongdispatcher.anystrong to emnotem cache a particular URL.  But in this case, the URL isnt known until a web author uses the template to create a page.  I dont want to have to go back and modify dispatcher.any every time a page is createdor at least I want to automate this if there is no other way.  I am using IIS for the dispatcher.  The reason I dont want to cache the pages is because the underlying JSPs that render the content for these pages produce dynamic content, and the pages dont use querystrings and wont carry authentication headers.  The pages will be created in unpredictable directories, so I dont know the URL pattern ahead of time.p  pstrongHow can I configure things so that emanyem page that is created from a certain template will be automatically excluded from the dispatcher cachestrongp  pIt seems like CQ ought to have some mechanism to respect HTTP responsecaching headers.

Negative 7992 pI have a Lucene Index with 50571 documents in it from 1740 books.  I have two processes that create this index.  The first process is to create the index on the device document by document.  This process is very slow.  The other process is to create a book index on the server, The exact same way I create it on the device and download and merge it with the master index. This one is much quicker to create the master index. Creating the index works fine either way.p  pThe problem is when I search on the downloadmerge index I get an codeOutOfMemoryExceptioncode, but when I search with the index that was created on the device I dont get that error.  I went through and created the index book by book downloadmerge and searched after each book was indexed based on that and when I get to book 450 I start getting the codeOutOfMemoryExceptioncode.  p  pWhat is causing me to run out of memory.p

Negative 7992 pIm not sure if theres a way to do this, but Id like to have an annotation for Classes that is only valid for Classes that implement a specific interface.p  pThe purpose of the annotation is to allow a manager to know that it needs to add an instance of that class to its set of managed objects. So if theres no way to add that restriction at compile time what would be the best pattern to deal with this at runtimep  pstrongBackgroundstrong  At present I have an application that allows users to perform a set of pre defined actions on a Strings[] that results in a single string output, the actions are grouped by scenario and I have an enum per scenario with those actions defined, and a single class that has a switch on these enums to call individual methods all within that class, meaning that adding a single action involves changes to several areas in the code, and I want to increase its maintainability by allowing a rookie developer to only need be aware of a single class they need to write that will add the action in to the right list and be available automatically.p  pThe solution I have decided upon is to have an Action Interface that the developer will implement, and then add an annotation to register that Action with the desired scenarioscenarios, isolating any new changes to the creation of a single class.p
Negative 7992 pOk, I am working with a premade bought template, where the author of said template wired things together in such a way where its next to impossible sometimes to get something the way you want, in this case I have a table I am trying to put in to a section of the template, that I dont need or want styled the way the guy has the template do it. However cause of how heshe did it I cant just go altering the CSS to do something else. I have tried classing the table as something else and styling it the way I want, but theres something that always manages to get snagged somewhere and the authors style persists on one piece or another of the table. So with that I came up with the idea, why not make a reset like class specific to tables that I can call this class in first on the element, then the class I want it to be styled under egp  pcodeclassresettable mynewstylecodep  pSo I am trying to come up with a means of doing it, but am getting stuck. p  precode.resettable,  .resettable table tr, .resettable tr td, .resettable table tbody, .resettable table thead, .resettable table tfoot, .resettable table tr th, .resettable table tfoot tr tf      margin0     padding0     backgroundnone     bordernone     bordercollapsecollapse     borderspacing0     backgroundimagenone  codepre  pNow this seems to work almost completely, theres still some things persisting. So Im hoping someone here can help me come up with a better variation of this. So all bases are covered in the sense of trying to reset a table back to normal default style.p

Negative 7992 pIve an application some wars on JBoss 5 but it isnt always getting deployed correctly with JRebel. Sometimes it works, and sometimes it doesnt. The times JRebel doesnt start Ive no clue to why. There are no errors anywhere in the console, logs, eclipse problems, etc and the JRebellogs are very cryptic and give no hints at all. After numerous restarts, rebuilds, eclipse refreshes and publishes to JBoss it is starting and everything is working fine.p  pSo, my question is, how do I troubleshoot JRebel  Obvisouly I want to have a more stable development envirionment.p  pEclipse Helios with JRebel version 5.1.0p

In some cases groupRowID looks like a group ID, in others it is the contact number or the name of the contact.  Note that I am using my home landline to call test and this is appearing.  Also  I only have 10 groups defined on the handset and an id of 11, 12 and 13 is printed in the output... It could be that Im missing something  I definitely know that the contactid Im passing in is a member of the Coworkers group groupID 5 on my phone but this is never returned in ICS.

If you can you should use static pngs generated in photoshop for the texture not the text just the fill but you may need several versions as I do to get the right effect on each screen as the texture is applied according to the size of the frame not the contained text. Doing it dynamically is possible but limited it seems.p

Negative 7992 pstrongIntroductionstrongp  pI am developing a code in Fortran solving an MHD problem with preconditioning of a linear operator. The sparse matrix to be inverted can be considered as a matrix of the following hierarchical structure. The original matrix say, A1 is a band matrix of blocks. Each block of A1 is a sparse matrix say, A2 of the same structure i.e. a block banded matrix. Each block of A2 is again a block banded matrix of the same sparsity structure, A3. Each block of A3 is, finally, a dense matrix 5 by 5, A4. I find this hierarchical representation is very convenient to initialize elements of the matrix.p  pstrongQuestionstrongp  pI wonder if there exists a library in Fortran permitting to handle such a structure and convert it in one of the standard sparse matrix formats CSR, CSC, BSR,..., since Sparse BLAS or MKL Pardiso will be used to invert it. Let me stress that my intention is to use the hierarchical structure only to initialize elements of the matrix. Of course, the hierarchical structure can be disregarded and the matrix could be hardcoded in the CSR format, but I find this is too time consuming to implement and test. p  pstrongCommentsstrongp  ol lipI dont expect a linear solver to use the hierarchical structure, although in S.

Negative 7992 pIn the code below, the trait BigSeqLike is a general typeclass that will be used to iterate all rows of large tables by reading in the rows a chunk at a time, performing some operation on them and then possibly writing them back to the database. p  pre code      trait BigSeqLike[T]        def size  Long       def groupedgroupSize Int  Iterator[Seq[T]]       def foreachGroupedWithProgressgroupSize Int, reportInterval Duration, report Progress  Unitf T  Unit  Duration       code pre  pUsers of the typeclass need only implement the size and grouped methods, as the foreachGroupedWithProgress is provided. It utilizes Scala parallel collections in its main loop. See code listing below for detailsp  pSince these operations tend to take a very long time to run, being to able to estimate the completion velocity of the foreach upfront is critical to judging whether to allow it to run to completion. Some computations might run for days or weeks. To facilitate this, BigSeqLike reports progress of the foreach loop using an actor whose job it is to monitor progress and issue a Progress case class to a provided report function at specified intervals.p  pre code      case class CountReportActortotal Long, startTimens Long, reportInterval Duration, report Progress  Unit extends Actor  self          private[this] var count  0l           Use Java ScheduledExecutorService to schedule a progress report at the specified interval         private[this] val reportRunner  new Runnable  def run  self  report          private[this] val scheduledExecutorService  Executors.newSingleThreadScheduledExecutor         private[this] val reportRunnerHandle  scheduledExecutorService.scheduleAtFixedRatereportRunner, reportInterval.toMillis,reportInterval.toMillis,TimeUnit.MILLISECONDS          def act            whiletrue  receive              case n Long                ifn  count                  count  n                            case report  reportProgresscount,total, startTimens,System.nanoTime             case stop, actorActor                actor  count               reportRunnerHandle.canceltrue               scheduledExecutorService.shutdown               exit                             code pre  pThe code works wonderfully when the n of the chunk size is small relative to the table row count, say n1000 for a 100k rows. However, if the n is large enough to fit the entire table into one chunk, say a 100k chunk for a 100k rows, no counts are ever reported to the CountReportActor until the end of the computation, when all counts are reported at once.p  pI am trying to diagnose why this happens. Is the CountReportActor being starved by the Scala parallel collection I am new to Actors and perhaps I have a fundamental misunderstanding about their operation Is this a consequence of the JVM JIT compilerp  pYour thoughts are welcome. p  pThanks and may your day be awesomep  pFull code listingp  pre code      package org.smach.util      import scala.concurrent.duration.     import scala.util.Random     import scala.actors.Actor     import java.util.concurrent.      trait BigSeqLike[T]        import BigSeqLike.        def size  Long       def groupedgroupSize Int  Iterator[Seq[T]]       def foreachGroupedWithProgressgroupSize Int, reportInterval Duration, report Progress  Unitf T  Unit  Duration           val startTimens  System.nanoTime          val countActor  CountReportActorsize, startTimens, reportInterval, report         countActor.start          groupedgroupSize.zipWithIndex.foreach  case chunk,i            0 until chunk.size.par.foreach  j              fchunkj             ifRandom.nextInt100  90                countActor  i  groupSize  j                                   countActor  i  groupSize  chunk.size                   countActor  stop, Actor.self         val finalCount  Actor.self.receive  case count Int  count           val timeNowns  System.nanoTime         reportProgressfinalCount, size, startTimens, timeNowns         val durationms  timeNowns  startTimens  1000000         durationms.millis                  object BigSeqLike        case class ProgresspercentSoFar Double, startTimens Long, endTimens Long          val elapsedTimes  endTimens  startTimens.toDouble  1000000000         val elapsedTimemin  elapsedTimes  60.toInt         val elapsedTimesec  elapsedTimes  60.toInt         val velocitypercentPerSec  percentSoFar  elapsedTimes         val totalRemainingTimes  100.0  percentSoFar  velocitypercentPerSec         val remainingTimemin  totalRemainingTimes  60.toInt         val remainingTimesec  totalRemainingTimes  60.toInt          override def toString             ifvelocitypercentPerSec  0              Completed .1f Elapsed 02d02d Remaining 02d02d.formatpercentSoFar, elapsedTimemin, elapsedTimesec, remainingTimemin, remainingTimesec            else              Completed .1f Elapsed 02d02d Remaining .formatpercentSoFar, elapsedTimemin, elapsedTimesec                                  object Progress          def applyn Long, maxN Long, startTimens Long, endTimens Long  Progress  new Progress           n.toDouble  maxN  100,           startTimens,           endTimens                        case class CountReportActortotal Long, startTimens Long, reportInterval Duration, report Progress  Unit extends Actor  self          private[this] var count  0l           Use Java ScheduledExecutorService to schedule a progress report at the specified interval         private[this] val reportRunner  new Runnable  def run  self  report          private[this] val scheduledExecutorService  Executors.newSingleThreadScheduledExecutor         private[this] val reportRunnerHandle  scheduledExecutorService.scheduleAtFixedRatereportRunner, reportInterval.toMillis,reportInterval.toMillis,TimeUnit.MILLISECONDS          def act            whiletrue  receive              case n Long                ifn  count                  count  n                            case report  reportProgresscount,total, startTimens,System.nanoTime             case stop, actorActor                actor  count               reportRunnerHandle.canceltrue               scheduledExecutorService.shutdown               exit                                  code pre

Negative 7992 pAt the moment I try to figure out how Spring Security evaluates the given URL, expression and annotations. So far it seems like it always checks the entries from codesecuritycontext.xmlcode first. And if thats a codedenyAllcode it will simply stop further processing of the request.p  pMaybe I forgot to set some configuration option, but in my eyes its not possible to build a nice whitelist using Spring Securitys annotations like codeSecuredcode, codePermitAllcode, etc..p  pWhat I want is basically to annotate the methods inside a codeControllercode for strongallowingstrong access. For examplep  precodeController RequestMappingtest public MyController      RequestMapping     public void tryToGetSomething         no security annotation gt denyAll           RequestMappingpublic     PermitAll     public void tryToGetSomethingPublic         this will always have access allowed           RequestMappingadmin     SecuredROLEADMIN     public void tryToGetSomethingReallyImportant         this can only be accessed by admins       codepre  pThe main reason for this approach is Security codecode. Its always possible to forget some annotations while writing code. And with this method such a mistake wont affect security of sensitive data.p  pSo my question is How can I achieve thisp

Later I learnt about stablepartition function where individual values of the Population are compared with 0.5555. On false, that data is created as a new Sample2 which complements sample1. p  pFurther to this How can I make this Generic i.e. a population into N subsamples of user defined  of population.p  pThank you for any help. I tried vector erase, remove, copy etc but it didnt materialize as the current code. I am looking for a better and more efficient logic and stl usage. p  precodeinclude ltrandomgt include ltiostreamgt include ltvectorgt include ltalgorithmgt  using namespace std  bool Is05555 float i     if  i gt 0.5560  return true     return false   int main      randomdevice rd     mt19937 genrd     uniformrealdistributionltgt dis1, 2     vectorltfloatgtrandVals      coutltltAll the Random Values between 1 and 2ltltendl     for int n  0 n lt 20 n          float rnv  disgen         coutltltrnvltltendl         randVals.pushbackrnv          cout ltlt n      randomdevice rd2     mt19937 gen2rd2     uniformintdistributionltintgt dist0,19      vectorltfloatgtsample     vectorltfloatgtsample2     for int n  0 n lt 6 n          float rnv  distgen2         sample.pushbackrandVals.atrnv         randVals.atrnv  0.5555           coutltltRandom Values between 1 and 2 with 0.5555 a Unique VAlueltltendl     for int n  0 n lt 20 n          coutltltrandVals.atnltlt           cout ltlt n      stdvectorltfloatgtiterator bound     bound  stdstablepartition randVals.begin, randVals.end, Is05555      for stdvectorltfloatgtiterator itrandVals.begin itbound it         sample2.pushbackit      coutltltsample.sizeltlt,ltltsample2.sizeltltendl      coutltltRandom Values between 1 and 2 Subset of 6 only ltltendl      for int n  0 n lt sample.size n          coutltltsample.atnltlt           cout ltlt n      coutltltRandom Values between 1 and 2  Remaining ltltendl     for int n  0 n lt sample2.size n          coutltltsample2.atnltlt           cout ltlt n      return 0  codepre

Negative 7992 pi am building a rpc server using http that serves 100000 clients. the server is using tomcat as container, basiclly each request made by client will be very fast because server will start a new thread to handle the request so there is no longhold request waiting return value.p  pi am wondering what tuning ponits are for this senario the frist thing i know is ipv4.contrack which controls max tcp connctions as well as some other parameters about tcp connection recycle. p  pbesides, what else should i look into tomcat threadpool maybe a one. though i think 100000 clicents will unlikely make request concurrently, i do want to make the sever be able to serve concurrently requests as many as possiblep

Negative 7992 pIve been looking for hours on this I cant really come up with anything thats going to work. Hopefully I can gain some insight here.p  pHere is the problem guys. Im trying to come up with a better solution for sorting inventory. The particular items have bar codes on them so I figured it would be easy to hop in excel and plug away. The problem that Im running into is that I cant really figure out how to assign a lot or location number for a specific item and be able to reuse that if it comes up later. For examplep  precodeModel Input     Location st1000dm003     1 ST336706LC      2 st1000dm003     1 st1000dm004     3 ST336705LC      4 st1000dm003     1 codepre  pPreferably, the numbering would start at 1 and move up. The group of items in column A might not always be the same, so a table with the model number and the location will not work. It has to be able to tell if its seen that before and what number was assigned or assign a new one if it has not been seen. The other issue that Id most likely run into, is that Id like to be able to run this on Office Mobile for Office 365 on Android at some point. Any help is really appreciatedp

Negative 7992 pIm working at an IT company where we have used Perforce for years as our code repository system, in our internal company network. Because we are starting to work with an offsite company we are looking into ways of making our Perforce server accessible via the internet.p  pThe most obvious way for me to do this is setup a VPN server on our linux gateway server and allow access through that. Obviously this works but seems very unsafe. If a VPN key of a certain user falls in the wrong hands they can access our coderepository AND our complete internal network.p  pMy first thought was to create a Perforce proxy server they supply software for this and host this behind another gateway, with a VPN server. This shields the real Perforce server and our network better. The obvious problem here is that the emproxyem needs access to our perforce server, meaning the two networks needs to be connected anyway.p  pOur company is rather small, so taking into account we dont have a huge resource pool to spend on this, how would you approach thisp  pthanks a lot in advance, Fred.p

I believe it should be something like thisp  precode[Files] Source otherinstaller.exe DestDir app Source myprogram.exe DestDir app BeforeInstall  RUN OTHERINSTALLER.EXE  Source data.dat DestDir app Source otherdata.dat DestDir app codepre

Negative 7992 pI got a couple of dead water damage, broken Samsung Galaxy S WiFi 3.6, so Id like to use some of the parts of them. Especially I hoped to use the camera modules for some CProjects, but I cant get hold of any datasheets. The main problem is that the camera modules have 24 pins, but the ribbon cable only connects to 21 of them, so I dont quite know which pin of the cable connects to what pin of the module, making it difficult to even get started.p  pCan anybody out there provide some helpful hints for this problemp  pThe cameras have got following codes printed on the ribbon cablep  pFront Cameras YPGS1 VT05 G1146 379 C1C27182Y1p  pBack Cameras YP GS1 2M07 1148G C1B27286Y2p  pThanks in advancep

Negative 7992 pHow does SharePoint behave when it does not find resource file Im interested specifically in SP2010 if the behavior was different across versions.p  pI found errors in ULS log specifying it cannot load resource file for given feature. It is quite expected as the feature does not contain any resources, however on several places in the code there is used syntax for localized resource e.g. codeDirectionResourcesDirectioncode attribute in List definition of schema.xml. These references to localized resource are clearly copyamppaste mistakes. What is the exact behavior of SharePoint in such situations Does it just write error in ULS log and uses empty string for the attribute value I guess so as the application runs fine and no known issue arises expect the ULS entries. But surprisingly I havent found any info on the behavior on the web..p

Negative 7992 pWe are experimenting with DevExpress XAF amp XPO in order to use it for our further devlopment of an existing small business ERP system. We have a SQL database, where the existing tables must not be changed. What we are trying to do is to add new needed table properties only to a new tables that then should be connected to the old tables through object inheritance codeMapInheritanceType.OwnTablecode. p  pFor examplep  pWe have a legacy tCustomer table. Now we add an XPO object tCustomerExtended like p  precodepublic class tCustomerExtended  test.Module.BusinessObjects.db.tCustomer ... codepre  pThe codetCustomerExtendedcode class then shall be extended with new properties and the codetCustomercode class remains unchanged in order to be used by the old client application.p  pThis works fine of course. A new table codetCustomerExtendedcode is generated with a primary key kCustomer the key of the legacy table. Also XAF generates a UI as expected The codetCustomerExtendedcode view is empty, since it shows the codetCustomerExtendedcode entries.p  p But what we really want to achieve is to show all existing codetCustomercode entries in this view and the new properties of codetCustomerExtendedcode. The OnSaving method should then save the legacy properties to tCustomer and the new properties to tCustomerExtended. Also we have to generate a kCustomer key, since the old tCustomer table kCustomer PK has no Identity Specification. p  pAt this moment I do not realize how to achieve this without changing the old codetCustomercode what is absolutely not allowed.p

See a hrefhttpdocs.spring.iospringdocs3.2.xspringframeworkreferencehtmltesting.html relnofollowDirtiesContext from herea. However, it appears that the Spring context is not reloaded in fact, entering in debug mode at the beginning of codetest2code supposedly codetest1code has been executed earlier I can see codejMockContextcode still holding expectations, execution list and errors if any from codetest1code.br  So, to end up with few questions, does codeDirtiesContextcode really cause Spring context to be reloaded as I understood from Spring Docs or did I misunderstand the annotation In the first case, what am I doing wrong In the latter case, how can I force Spring context to be reloaded for every testp  pstrongEDITstrong, to delimit the problem I had a code like the sample above running from few days, then today I created a new test in which I added an expectation which failed. Then, I saw all the other tests in the class failing for the same reason while they where codegreencode until today. Debugging, I found out that codejMockContextcode was never cleared, which means all tests were adding expectations to the same pool of course, as long as no expectation failed, that was transparent and I did not notice it codetest1code adds and passes few expectations, codetest2code takes a notempty pool of expectations ALREADY passed and adds its own so there was no problem, but I do not like the previous situation and I would like to start each test with no previous set expectations at all.p
Negative 7992 pSuppose I have a method that take in an InputStream. p  pThis method need to wrap this InputStream with a BufferedInputStream to use its mark and reset functionality. However, the passed in InputStream might still be used by the caller of the method.p  precodepublic static void fooInputStream is throws Exception      BufferedInputStream bis  new BufferedInputStreamis     int b  bis.read   public static void mainString[] args        try          InputStream is  new FileInputStreamsomeFile         foois         int b  is.read  return 1     catch Exception e          e.printStackTrace       codepre  pMy questions is what exactly happen to the original InputStream when the BufferedInputStream is read or initializedp  pMy assumption is that the original InputStream will also move forward if the BufferedInputStream is read. However, after debugging my code, I have found that the InputStream will return 1 instead when read.p  pIf the original InputStream is not readable after such process, how should I go about achieving my purposep  precodeInputStream is foois                Method only take in generic InputStream object                         Processing of the passed in InputStream object require mark and reset functionality int b  is.read      Return the next byte after the last byte that is read by foo codepre  pEDIT I suppose what Im asking for is quite generic and therefore requires a lot of work. As for what Im working on, I actually dont need the full mark amp reset capability so I have found a small work around.

Negative 7992 pI have a Rails frontend server, which receives multiple requests from users, then send these requests to backend server.p  pBackend server processes requests asynchronously and notifies frontend server when it finishes each of the requests.p  pI use Redis pubsub to communicate between these two servers. In particular, for each request coming from users, I create a new Redis instance that subscribes to the single channel say, codescoringchannelcode.p  pHowever, if I have 100 users making requests at the same time, each of the Redis subscribers will hold one thread. p  pDoes this affect my server performance If I have a constraint on maximum number of threads e.g., Heroku allows max 256 threads, how should I avoid this issuep

Negative 7992 pI simulate a web cache replacement algorithm. I have N objects of type Request available for caching and L requests for those objects that arrive to the cache in a serial fashion. p  pRequest objects are distinguished by their int field reqID a numeric ID from 0 up to N1. I have override equals to be able to compare Request objects.p  pI implement a cache using an array  a simple, plain, static array.p  pThe cache is filled with objects of type Request and has a max size Mp  precode Max cache size  private int M   Cache  private Request[] cache  new Request[M] codepre  pI have insertions, evictions and replacements of objects in the cache. p  pI have also a sliding window of the last K requests implemented as an ArrayDequep  precode Max window size  private int K   Window  private DequeltRequestgt window  new ArrayDequeltRequestgtK codepre  pValues M and K are initialized at the constructor and set at main.p  pI keep the score request count in a sliding window of last K requests of the objects in a HashMapp  precode Map of reqID K  Score V  MapltInteger, Integergt score codepre  pI keep the cache ordered in terms of the score of the cached items, with the highest score being at the left end and the lowest score being at the right end.p  pDue to the fact that when I have a cache hit for an item its score is increased by 1 while when I have a request for an item dropped from the window the score of that item is decreased by 1, in those cases I might have cache reordering with the relevant item exchanging position in the cache with the next item at its left or right, respectively. Therefore, I should be able to know the index of each random item in the cache at any given time. For that purpose, I use an integer field called counter and a HashMap called positionsp  precode Counter  position in the cache  private int counter   Map of ReqID K  Counter V  private MapltInteger, Integergt positions codepre  pFinally, I use an inCache map in order to avoid the for loop in lookup operationp  precode Map with boolean flags to check whether an item ReqID is in cache or not  private MapltInteger, Booleangt inCache codepre  pand an isMoreThanOne flag to avoid calling the getter for the current cache size when this size is largep  precode Flag for more than 1 items in cache  private boolean isMoreThanOne codepre  pThe reason is that, since my cache is a vanilla array and not an ArrayList, it does not have a size method, and length field is the fixed capacity given, not the current cache size.

Negative 7992 pI know this has been asked, probably, a million times, but for the life of me I cannot get anything to work. p  pI have a UI wizard control that on the changed event validates the model. If the model is not valid, it doe not allow the user to move forward in the wizard.

So the main reason to make these methods static members of Base is to be able to codefriend class Basecode in each of the derived classes instead of friending every function.p  hr  pRefactoring showed me, that I could move the code accessing the protected constructors of the derived classes into a single factory function. That way, Im able to move the functions with the default parameters outside codeBasecode and let the call the factory. Now I still have to friend every one of those functions, but only a single time in codeBasecode to give them access to the factory. I could circumvent this by placing all functions into a helper class and friending it instead, but that looks like a hack to me.p  precodeclass Base    friend class Helper  The Hack   friend void noproblemhereBase ampamp  No hack, more writting     protected     static void factoryThing ampamp fromwhichIcanconstructthecorrectderivedclass      return type void to keep it simple, move parameter type because special cases      handled in trampoline functions and a copy of the Thing must be stored either      way.  class Derived  public Base    friend class Base    protected constructor omited for simplicity.    void noproblemhereBase ampamp  makederived  ... void noproblemhereBase ampamp b      work, and then call Basefactory    or  class Helper    protected      Constructors ...   public     static void noproblemeitherBase ampamp  makederived  codepre

Negative 7992 pFor example, I have some storage which I want to manage via jmx. I want to have control over all members of storage together and separately.

It would be easier if I could register StorageMBean and it would provide nested MBeans as attribute or something like this. So via such method I would be able to obtain all entries and work with them individually. I hope my explanation was not very confusing. Is it possible to do such thingp
Negative 7992 pThe Qt documentation a hrefhttpqtproject.orgdocqt5.0qtcorethreadsreentrancy.htmlstates this about threadsafety and reentrancyap  blockquote   pNote Qt classes are only documented as threadsafe if they are intended to be used by multiple threads. If a function is not marked as threadsafe or reentrant, it should not be used from different threads. If a class is not marked as threadsafe or reentrant then a specific instance of that class should not be accessed from different threads.p blockquote  pThis seems to state that every function and class in Qt should be considered nonreentrant and nonthreadsafe unless explicitly stated so.p  pHowever, in the documentation of codeQRectcode and codeQPointcode, for example, neither threadsafety nor reentrancy is mentioned, but I find it hard to believe they are not. In fact, a hrefhttpwww.archivum.infoqt4previewfeedbacktrolltech.com20050100485ReQRectQPointreentrancy.htmlthis old discussiona says its a lack in the documentationp  blockquote   pThese classes are just plain data a few primitives, no shared structured or static data, so they are reentrant. That they are not marked as such, is a lack in our documentation.p blockquote  pSo, how should we know if a function is reentrant or not Is the reentrancy note omitted only for simple classes where its implied by its obviousnessp

Negative 7992 pIm using Jenkins v1.546, hosted on a Windows Server 2008 R2 SP1 machine.p  pIve set up a fairly simple job for building a Maven Java project.  It polls the SCM with no schedule and picks up remote build triggers, requiring an authentication token.  It uses Subversion and performs clean checkouts with codesvn updatecode.  Additionally, it has a postbuild step that archives some build artifacts i.e., the resulting WAR and WSDLs.p  pThe issue Im experiencing is that the builds that it stores on the filesystem itself contain invalid characters in their filenames.  This causes our automatic backup process to blow up, it being unable to alter or remove those directoriesfiles with the codecode.  I myself cannot movedelete those folders or files either, but if I rename it and remove the codecode, then things work fine.  Oh, and if I try to follow one of these links with the codecode in it, it doesnt resolve. None of the other jobs seem to do this  just my job, of course.  Anyone know why this may be occurring and what I can do to resolve thisp  pIve attached multiple screenshots that show the bad filename and my Jenkins job setup.  I had to white out some company information.  If I can provide any additional information to help troubleshoot this, just let me know.p  pAlso, as an update, I did some additional research, looking through the changelogs for each released version of Jenkins since my version latest is 1.557.  I saw three possible issues in the changelogs that could be related, but its hard for me to tell.  I cannot simply upgrade our Jenkins to test out this theory, since Ill need to provide a reason for upgrading beyond a hunch.p  pa hrefhttpsissues.jenkinsci.orgbrowseJENKINS21023 relnofollowhttpsissues.jenkinsci.orgbrowseJENKINS21023abr a hrefhttpsissues.jenkinsci.orgbrowseJENKINS20534 relnofollowhttpsissues.jenkinsci.orgbrowseJENKINS20534abr a hrefhttpsissues.jenkinsci.orgbrowseJENKINS21958 relnofollowhttpsissues.jenkinsci.orgbrowseJENKINS21958a  p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comkLTWH.png altbad filename screenshotp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comv4nzL.png altJenkins configuration  1st halfp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comhim04.png altJenkins configuration  2nd halfp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.combOMSu.png altJenkins configuiration  PostBuild Actionsp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comxOQhS.png altJenkins  bad location when clicking on bad filefolder namep

Negative 7992 pThe HSQLDB documentation says something to the effect ofp  blockquote   pSpecial care may be needed w.r.t. file path specifications containing whitespace, mixedcase, special characters andor reserved file names.

Instead, in the variable inspector, it appears the name of t, the first letter of test.fp7. I have tested this with other name othertest.fp7 and again it takes the first letter o. Therefore, the recordset instruction fails with runtime error 80004005. Why only takes the first letter Please, Im completely shockedp  pI also configured a MySQL database to test the communication between VBA and MySQL and worked great with a similar code. p  pAny help will be well received.

Negative 7992 pI commonly need to implement auditing in my EF projects and have found that the builtin codeChangeTrackercode to be the most effective way to determine, well, the changes that have been made.

Negative 7992 pI am new to Multi threading concept of C.Net and I have the following requirement.p  pOur application should first fetch the customers only ids for whom data processing needs to be done and based on size of the WorkPacketterminology used for packeting a set of customers into a workable packet, WorkPackets are created. So each workpacket contains a set of customersp  pNow each of the workpacket created on run time needs to be executed on different threads. So all the threads needs to be created and aborted on runtime.

Negative 7992 pHow would you implement the reverse state monad emtransformerem in OCamlp  pThis is a followup of the question a hrefhttpsstackoverflow.comquestions24943140thereversestatemonadinocamlThe reverse state monad in OCamla I was able to rediscover Lambdageeks answer by myself after understanding the tricks he or she used especially the pattern matching of lazy expressions in the module LazyUtils. Then I spent the rest of the day trying to generalize this to the case of the reverse state transformer. But I am stuck because I cannot find how to define the bind. The only solution that I can vaguely imagine would use the mfix of the monad in parameter but this is itself a hrefhttpsstackoverflow.comquestions24944117mfixforthestatemonadinocamlproblematic to definea because it leads to looping recursion due to the strict semantics in OCaml.p

Negative 7992 pAre there any major advantages of using OWIN cookiebased authentication over Forms Authentication cookiebased authentication for developing MVC web applicationsp  pThe reason I ask is that I would not be using any of the Entity Framework based hooks for OWIN authentication. Ive built apps based on Forms Authentication for years and have been able to do things like create different authentication tokens for admins faster timeouts, anonymous users, and registered users. Using the UserData portion of the ticket I was able to implement universal sign out, store custom properties, etc.p  pOne of the advantages to OWIN might be testability, but Im not sure. The ClaimsIdentity is kind of nice  because I can easily store and access custom fields without having to serializedeserialize the properties into UserData. Other things I should considerp

The different times as mentioned above 1300 etc are the times of which when the game starts. So what i want to do is if the currentTime is 1323, then i would change the time label of that soccer game to 23 since 23minutes has passed. If the total time that has passed is over 108 minutes then it means the game is over that is why i set the time variable to FT in the last if statement.p  pAs i said before this is where the problem occurs since the diffminutes gives me a value of higher than 108 minutes when the games has not yet been started it will change the time variable to FT which is wrongp

Negative 7992 punfortunately my actual template is too full of stuff that is unrelated to my question, so i tried to put everything in a short example. Lets say, I have written the following template p  precodeinclude ltvectorgt template lttypename Tgt class MyTemplate   public     typedef voidMyFuncT     void addFuncMyFunc fmyFuncs.pushbackf     void callFuncsT value         for stdsizet i0iltmyFuncs.sizeimyFuncs[i]value        private     stdvectorltMyFuncgt myFuncs  codepre  pI learned already, that I can specialize this template to behave different when the passed type is a vector, so I wrote thisp  precodetemplate lttypename Tgt class MyTemplateltstdvectorltTgt gt     public        typedef voidMySingleElementFuncT        void addSingleElementFuncMySingleElementFunc f            thisgtmySingleElementFuncs.pushbackf                void callFuncsstdvectorltTgt value            for stdsizet i0iltmyFuncs.sizei                myFuncs[i]value                        for stdsizet i0iltmySingleElementFuncs.sizei                for int sizet i0iltvalue.sizei                     mySingleElemetnFuncs[i]value[i]                                                   private            stdvectorltMySingleElementFuncgt mySingleElementFuncs  codepre  pNow my question is, what is the most elegant way if possible without inheritance not only to specialize the template for the case of vectorlt T  but at the same time still being able to use the first templates methods where vectorlt T  is the template parameter. What I would like to do later is the followingp  precodevoid Func1int i void Func2stdvectorltintgt i  MyTemplateltstdvectorltintgt gt myTemplate myTemplate.addFuncFunc1 myTemplate.addFuncFunc2 codepre  pIs it possible to achieve this without simply copyamppaste all stuff I need from the original template, to do the same also with the specialized version I guess I will have to use some kind of inheritance. However, I want to avoid something like thisp  precodeMyTemplateltstdvectorltintgt gt myTemplate  myTemplate.addFuncFunc1  does not work myTemplate.addFuncFunc2 MyVectorTemplateltstdvectorltintgt gt myVectorTemplate myVectorTemplate.addFuncFunc1    works   myVectorTemplate.addFuncFunc2 codepre  pi.e. the functionality should be determined only by the type passed to the template but not by choosing the appropriate subclass. Anyhow, I have to admit that I am a bit confused about how to inherit in this case. If it was not a template, I could write something likep  precodeclass MyVectorClass  public MySingleObjectClass  codepre  pHowever, the following does not make any sensep  precodetemplate lttypename Tgt MyTemplateltstdvectorltTgt gt  public MyTemplateltstdvectorltTgt gt codepre  pbut in some sense, this is what I would like to have.p  pI am sorry for such a long post and I hope it is more or less clear what is my problem...p  pEDIT I just found a mistake in the above code. The loop in the vector template should readp  precodefor stdsizet i0iltmySingleElementFuncs.sizei     for int sizet j0jltvalue.sizej         mySingleElemetnFuncs[i]value[j]       codepre  pi.e. each registered function should be called once for each entry in the vector. Otherwise the template does not work if the number of registered functions is not equal to the size of the vector.p

Negative 7992 pI would like to create a Python C extension module with a class that can dynamically aliaschangeselect its methods based on the codeinitcode method argument values.

Would you define codeself.funccode as a codePyMemberDefcode or a codePyObjectcode  Should it be registered in the codePyTypeObjectcode via emtpmethodsem or emtpmembersem  And after defining codeself.funccode, how could the desired C function be dynamically aliased to itp  pCheersp

Negative 7992 pI am trying to multiply 2 large matrices in a most efficient way. Particularly, at one hand I have one matrix having dimensions 8.000 X 20.000 and on the other hand, I have the one with dimensions 35.000.000 X 20.000. Both these matrices have the columns with the identical values that is, 20.000 columns are in order and identical for both. Both matrices are too sparse and have boolean binary values. By multiplying them, I am trying to grab total commons for each row value.p  pI applied MATLAB to this end but it was not possible to multiply them due to out of memory issue. So I partitioned the larger matrix and made smaller chunks. Lets say 1.000.000 X 200. After applying this separation process, I managed to multiply but it took about 5 hours to process even though in matlab this multiplying process is multithreaded automatically.p  pI retrieved these matrices in my java script. I was wondering, if there might be faster way for the process. For example, would it make sense to apply Hadoop in java and do the process within java Or is there any other suggestionp  pThanks in advance.  p

Negative 7992 pI am a beginner so if this question sounds stupidunclear or very easy , please bear with me.p  pHow can I add a list of numbers together in order to reach a target number or get as close as possible For example, here is a list of numbers 2,3,4,7,20,25, goal  105. The result should be this 25,25,25,25,3,2. The order of given numbers matters always start with the biggest number in the list and add them up in order get close to the given value, so it will choose the next digit to test.  the result could be also 20, 20, 20, 20, 25, which is not right in this case, because it doesnt follow the order of numbers. The algorithm only jump for the next number if it can feet otherwise cant jump.p  pBest Mp

Negative 7992 pI have an NSPopover connected to the NSView of a window. Currently I have a NSStatusItem that displays a NSStatusMenu. When you click a certain option in that menu I set the menu to nil and then display the NSPopover. The problem is I want the status bar button to remain highlighted when the NSPopover is displayed, but it only flashes highlight when I click the button to open the NSPopover. I have tried statusItem.button.highlighttrue to no avail, and it seems changing the button type does not do anything either. Any ideas Thanks.

Negative 7992 pI learn new things in Scala everyday. The current route I am taking is to pull out functionality from java nio and make Scala implementations out of them.

Negative 7992 pim a 1st year computer science student and i am a little stuck on my end of year project. the project requires me to create a student management system in java using eclipse, it must have at least 3 classes and use ArrayLists to hold the data. so far i have the menu class which is used for navagation and the student class which holds the students information surname, first name and student id completed and both work fine. now where i am having trouble is the subject class, i have to add the students that have enrolled in the either or both of the subjects to the arraylists for the subjects. so my question is how do i take the values stored in the student arraylist and pass them into the subject arraylists. im not really looking for the answer but more of a point in the right direction or some advice just incase i have overlooked something. also if knows of any links to similar asked questions, please post them. p  pthank you.p

Negative 7992 pId like to write a C lockfree object where there are many logger threads logging to a large global nonatomic ring buffer, with an occasional reader thread which wants to read as much data in the buffer as possible.  I ended up having a global atomic counter where loggers get locations to write to, and each logger increments the counter atomically before writing.  The reader tries to read the buffer and perlogger local atomic variable to know whether particular buffer entries are busy being written by some logger, so as to avoid using them.p  pSo I have to do synchronization between a pure reader thread and many writer threads.  I sense that the problem can be solved without using locks, and I can rely on happens after relation to determine whether my program is correct.p  pIve tried relaxed atomic operation, but it wont work atomic variable stores are releases and loads are acquires, and the guarantee is that some acquire and its subsequent work always happen after some release and its preceding work.  That means there is no way for the reader thread doing no store at all to guarantee that something happens after the time it reads the buffer, which means I dont know whether some logger has overwritten part of the buffer when the thread is reading it.p  pSo I turned to sequential consistency.  For me, atomic means Boost.Atomic, which notion of sequential consistency has a pattern a hrefhttpwww.boost.orgdoclibs1570dochtmlatomicthreadcoordination.htmlatomic.threadcoordination.seqcst relnofollowdocumentedap  blockquote   pThe third pattern for coordinating threads via Boost.Atomic uses   seqcst for coordination If ...p      ol   lithread1 performs an operation A,li   lithread1 subsequently performs any operation with seqcst,li   lithread1 subsequently performs an operation B,li   lithread2 performs an operation C,li   lithread2 subsequently performs any operation with seqcst,li   lithread2 subsequently performs an operation D,li   ol      pthen either A happensbefore D or C happensbefore B holds.p blockquote  pNote that the second and fifth lines say any operation, without saying whether it modify anything, or what it operates on.  This provides the guarantee that I wanted.p  pAll is happy until I watch the talk of Herb Sutter titled atomiclt Weapnos.  What he implies is that seqcst is just a acqrel, with the additional guarantee of consistent atomic stores ordering.  I turned to the a hrefhttpen.cppreference.comwcppatomicmemoryorder relnofollowcppreference.coma, which have similar description.p  pSo my questionsp  ol liDoes C11 and Boost Atomic implement the same memory modelli liIf 1 is yes, does it mean the pattern described by Boost is somehow implied by the C11 memory model  How  Or does it mean the documentation of either Boost or C11 in cppreference is wrongli liIf 1 is no, or 2 is yes, but Boost documentation is incorrect, is there any way to achieve the effect I want in C11, namely to have guarantee that the work subsequent to some atomic store happens after the work preceding some atomic loadli ol

Negative 7992 pA question just cropped into my mind that if StringBuilderStringBuffer is always better than String then why do we still use it p  pI mean shouldnt StringBuilderStringBuffer always be used, replacing String completely It is said If the Object value is not going to change use String Class because a String object is immutable but we can also use StringBuilderStringBuffer and get better performance.p
Negative 7992 pI am creating a timer app that calculates some prices while timer is running. The app needs to be localized to reflect local currency on the phone, which is pretty easy using codeNSNumberFormattercode and codesetNumberStyleNSNumberFormatterCurrencyStylecode method. However, I use a stepper to decrease and increase values, which can be different based on currency.p  pI.e., in Scandinavia NOK, DKK, SEK I would like to deincrease 50, each step, and in Euro I would like to deincrease 10 each step. Same in USD.p  pI know I cant take all currencies into account, but some of the biggest should be reflected in my app.p  pWhat would be the best practise to do this kind of configurationp

Negative 7992 pIm trying to learn Three.js, beeing new to those technologies. I achieved a sun with planet orbitting around, with moon orbitting around planet.

But along with one extra object per planetmoon, theres an issue that parent rotation spins planet in place too, during to codeupdateMatrixWorldcode Object3D method. So it will spin a bit faster than you may assume by looking at codemesh2.rotateOnAxis AXIS, 0.01 code bit.li lia hrefhttpjsfiddle.nett83pzoj24 relnofollowthis fiddlea shows one parentless approach. Case is, Im trying to find way, where I can configure planet positionsspinsspeedorbitspeed at system start and than just feed it with server time, so it will make it feel synchronised between players being at same location.li ul  h13. Question itselfh1  pAs far as I travelled through manuals, I found there may be a possibility of performing such animation using Three.js matrix logic. Im willing to reduce usage of codeanimatecode inside objects as far as possible maybe by overriding codeupdateMatrixcode and codeupdateMatrixWorldcode methods.

Negative 7992 pIm currently updating a very old website from 5.4.x to 5.6.3.3. So far Ive been able to upgrade to 5.5.2.1 locally without problems.p  pBut upgrading from 5.5.2.1 to 5.6.x causes a lot of problems. Ive tried updating directly to 5.6.3.3, which the backend suggests, as well as 5.6.0, 5.6.0.1 and 5.6.0.2 with no luck.p  pThe problem is that when i click Download, Concrete5 downloads 5.6.3.2. Not the advertised 5.6.3.3. After the download has completed, nothing happens. I cant click update, I can only click the download button again. However Concrete5 does download the 5.6.3.2 update.p  pIve tried running the upgrade script manually. The manual upgrade script returns this messagep  blockquote   pUpgrade concrete5 p      pYour site is already up to date You should remove this file for   security. Back to Home    Click here if you would like to rerun this   script.The current version of Concrete5 is 5.5.2.1.p blockquote  pSo I click and force1 is added to the URL. This returnsp  blockquote   pUpgrade to 5.5.2.1 completep blockquote  pThats with  in the site.php. If I remove that and run it like this guides suggests a hrefhttpwww.concrete5.orgdocumentationhowtosdevelopersmanuallyupgradeconcrete5 relnofollowhttpwww.concrete5.orgdocumentationhowtosdevelopersmanuallyupgradeconcrete5a, I only get blank pages and cannot run the upgrade script manually. Ive tried both methods mentioned in the guide without luck, and Ive also tried different versions of 5.6.p  pSo my next step was to download 5.6.3.3 manually and place it in the updates folder. Now the update page returnsp  blockquote   pInstall Local Updatep      pMake sure you backup your database before updating. Several updates   are available.

Its like the dirname change happens before the script updates the database and therefore nothing happens. The process stops and all pages are blank.p  pNow this is where Im stuck.

but none of them worked in my case. Especially the foreign key in the composite key seems to be a rare problem. Im well aware, that it would be much easier to add a surrogate key to the msgusertable, but I have to solve exactly this problem, so I would be happy if someone could show me how to code the domain classes with the relations in the right way.

Negative 7992 pIve been following this question to retrieve the twitter feed for a particular user a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions17067996authenticateandrequestauserstimelinewithtwitterapi11oauthAuthenticate and request users timeline twitter api 1.1a which is working as expected, the issue I now have is trying to style it to make it look like the twitter feed, the reason we are doing this on the server is because we have a database with all our tweets in so instead of making calls to twitter we have decided to call our database and pull them through.  This was implemented and followed through just encase twitter decided to update there API which may result in our feed working management didnt want to take that chance. p  pI have spent some time today trying to find a possible solution to see if this has been done already, Im aware people have provided server side code to retrieve the tweets but I cant find an example of passing the tweets to the view and displaying them.  And if you hadnt guessed already Im new to the hole twitter scene so please bare with me.p

Negative 7992 pI have an object model where there is a parent object codeParentcode that can contain many child objects codeChildcode. The codeChildcode object can be referenced and accessed via Spring Data Rest on its own. Think of the typical codeCustomercode and codeOrderscode case. I can list and manage codeOrderscode on their own. Each codeOrdercode has a reference to the codeCustomercode object. The codeCustomercode object also has a link to the codeOrderscode related to that customer. SDR generates all of the HAL links correctly. So I can navigate from a particular codeOrdercode to the codeCustomercode of that order, and then to all of the codeOrdercodes for that codeCustomercode. However, the link that is generated in the codeCustomercode object for the list of codeOrdercodes is not paginated, like the original codeOrdercodes would be via the codeRepositorycode. p  pIs there a way to get SpringHATEOAS to generate pagablesortable links for the dependent collection in the codeCustomercode case Ive describedp

Negative 7992 pI am attempting to parse out specific fields from XML files plural from a table in SQL Server. I have written a stored proc to do this using attributecentric XQuery, but the efficiency is abysmal 3 hours for 31 rows. After some research I found that elementcentric XQuery may be more efficient, but the only examples Ive found so far have the XML file set to a scalar variable. In other words, one file that is copypasted into the query, then the fields are selected from TC.nodesnode1 etc.. I cannot use this approach as I am querying 2 million records that each have their own XML file and the formatlayout is not necessarily the same. The table also contains common SQL data types varchar, int etc..p  pHeres an XML example each file for each ID is stored in the a table as a  file shortcut. Clicking on the shortcut opens the XML file in SQL Server as you would see belowp  precodeltNode1gt   ltNode2gt     ltNode3gt       ltIDgt555555555ltIDgt     ltNode3gt   ltNode2gt   ltNode2agt     ltNameJohngt   ltNode2agt ltNode1gt codepre  pSay for instance, I want to get the SUBMISSIONID varchar stored in the same table, but not in the XML file, name, and ID for all in the population that have some additional criteria. As I said, I have done this using the following attributecentric approachp  precode    SELECT        SUBSTRINGSUBMISSIONID, 1, 20 as SUBMISSIONID,        SUBSTRINGXMLDATA.valueNode1Node2Node3ID[1],varchar20,1,9 as ID,        SUBSTRINGXMLDATA.valueNode1Node2aName[1],varchar30,1,20 as Name FROM dbname.dbo.EXAMPLETABLE WHERE Name LIKE JOHN codepre  pNote Im using substrings because I am exporting the data to a tabdelimited text file, so I want fixedlength columns.p  pSo my goal is to write this query more efficiently, maybe using elementcentric XQuery, but I am not sure how I can set my XML format data as an array and parse fields from that array. I thought maybe I could use a cursor, but RBAR isnt necessarily the most efficient thing in the world either.p  pHeres an example of my second and unsuccessful attempt  using a cursor and elementcentric XQueryp  precodeDECLARE OpenXML XML         SET OpenXML      ltNode1gt       ltNode2gt         ltNode3gt           ltIDgt555555555ltIDgt         ltNode3gt       ltNode2gt       ltNode2agt         ltNameJohngt       ltNode2agt     ltNode1gt           DECLARE XQCur CURSOR STATIC FORWARDONLY READONLY FOR     SELECT          tbl.SUBMISSIONID,         dbname.dbo.EXAMPLETABLE.VALUEID[1],varchar20 as ID,         dbname.dbo.EXAMPLETABLE.VALUEName[1],varchar20 as Name,         FROM dbname.dbo.EXAMPLETABLE tbl,               OpenXML.NODESNode1Node2Node3 dbname.dbo.EXAMPLETABLEXMLDATA,              OpenXML.NODESNode1Node2a dbname.dbo.EXAMPLETABLEXMLDATA   OPEN XQCur FETCH NEXT FROM XQCur  WHILE 0  FETCHSTATUS BEGIN     FETCH NEXT FROM XQCur     END     CLOSE XQCur     DEALLOCATE XQCur codepre

Negative 7992 pIm reading through ML for the Working Programmer and am a bit confused by the authors distinction between iterative and recursive.  My understanding was that recursive just refers to a function that calls itself.  Any function that isnt recursive is iterative where an iterative algorithm usually involves some kind of looping.p  pHowever, in this book, the author will say something like luckily the obvious recursive solution is iterative.  So my understanding of these terms is definitely different from how the author is using them.  p  pCan someone clarify where Im misunderstanding these termsp  pThanks, bclaymanp

Negative 7992 pIm making WordPress plugin that is using a few third party libraries. Is it common practice to use Composer for WordPress pluginp  pIf its okay to use it, then I assume that I should provide all Composer files along with my plugin, because I dont want to make people manually run codecomposer installcode.p  pAnother question is, is it safe to use Composers autoloading I configured it to autoload my own classes and the libraries are of course autoloaded as well.

Negative 7992 pI put a small white ball on the water surface. Wind makes the white ball move in the water. I want to using the opencv to detect and track the ball.Because the backgroundwater surface is single color, also the ball is single color. I just use the color in hsv and set a threshold to detect the white colorball. I think this way is easier and better than camshift, tld, Optical flow method. Now I have a problem, I detect the white color to find the ball, but sometimes the wind is strong and water wave will happen follow the ball. Just like the pic as followp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.com1Ykja.jpg altenter image description herep  pThe wave is also have white color in hsv. So i when i use findcontours to get the edge of ball, i will get the edge including ball and wave. I have tried to use erode and dilate to remove the wave noise.But i cant get a good result. I have no idea now. Can you help and show me how can i remove the wave in a better way Im not sure just using color to detect ball is a best choice in my case. Maybe I should try camshift, tld, Optical flow method Can you show your idea to meThanks in advancep

I have an unmodified string, for instance codeabcdefgcode and an array of objects that contains a string and indices. p  pFor instance, object 1 contains codedcode and indices code[1, 2]codep  pThen I would replace whatever letter is at substring code[1,2]code with codedcode, with the resulting string looking like codeadcdefgcode.p  pThe problem comes when the replacing text is of different length then the replaced text. I need some way to keep track of the length changes or else the indices of further replacements would be inaccurate.p  pHere is what I have so farp  precode for CandidateResult cResult  candidateResultList        int[] index  cResult.getIndex        finalResult  finalResult.substring0, index[0]  cResult.getCandidate                finalResult.substringindex[1], finalResult.length should switch to stringbuilder    return finalResult codepre  pThis does not take care of the corner case mentioned above. p  pAdditionally, this is not homework if anyone was wondering. This is actually for an ocr trainer program that  Im creating.p
Negative 7992 pIm running JavaTomcat project in Elastic Beanstalk. Ive setup an Elasticache group in the same vpc. Currently, just testing with a single EC2 instance.

Negative 7992 pThe thing with PHP is that it doesnt have a specific syntax when using a function with optional arguments. Thisp  precodefoo10 codepre  pcan either be thisp  precodefunction fooa  codepre  por thisp  precodefunction fooa  0  codepre  por thisp  precodefunction fooa, b  0, ...  codepre  por even codefunction foo code, but disregard that for now.p  pSo how do we typeinfer it when a function is used before its definedp  pOne solution is to record all usages until the definition comes, and then see if they all can unify with it. The example above would then storep  precodeint gt unit codepre  pand later check if its compatible withp  precodeint gt typ list gt unit codepre  por whatever where codetyp listcode is the list of optional arguments.p  pYou think this could work Are there other conventional ways to deal with thisp
Negative 7992 pCurrently, Laravel redirects the user to a different URL if he isnt logged in eg codeauthlogincode. codeauthlogincode contains logic to check if a user has supplied login credentials, in which case they are redirected to another page eg codehomecode.p  pIs this correct Im still learning.p  pId like to change this functionality. Ideally, when a user visits codecode or codeindex.phpcode, Laravel would detect that hes not logged in and would return a different view the login form and strongnotstrong redirect. The user would see codeuserscode in the navigation bar, not codeauthlogincode. The login form would submit to the same page.p  pNow, when Laravel detects that the user isnt logged in but codeAuthcheckcode works, it would log the user in and continue with the original view.p  pThe reason Id like to do this is so that Angular view navigation still works. Because of the redirect, the param codeuserscode is lost and we can only redirect the user to the dashboard.p  pIs this possible is Laravel Id be satisfied with learning where all the current functionality is hidden so I can start there.p

Heres a screenshot of the optionsp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comrPP9M.png altenter image description herep  pIve created an empty codeformdata.phpcode file and uploaded it to my site, then put that URL in the field seen in the screenshot. Nothing happens in the php file when I submit a form. The support team for the plugin hasnt been very helpful, they just said, You need to make sure the script on that URL will catch and parse the data. Is there anything that I would need to add to the php file to get this to workp

Negative 7992 pI have a problem. I recently installed VS 2015 and Windows 10 on my computer. Having Universal Apps are amazing and I plan to convert some of my programs on UWP. But I have a problem.

And when OneDrive is available, the newly stored datas are pushed to OneDrive. Synchronisation in fact. So it is the problem.

Negative 7992 pThe codeCloseablecode interface was introduced in Java 5 whereas the codeAutoCloseablecode interface came in Java 7 together with the codetrywithresourcescode statement. codeCloseablecode extends since Java 7 the codeAutocloseablecodeinterface.p  pIn the book strongOCAOCP Java SE 7  Programmer I amp II Study Guidestrong it says on page 399p  blockquote   pWhat happends if we call the codeclosecode multiple time It depends. For classes that implement codeAutoCloseablecode, the implementation is required to be idempotent. Which means you can call codeclosecode all day and nothing will happen the second time and beyond. [...] For classes that implement codeCloseablecode, there is no such guarantee.p blockquote  pSo according to this text, implementations of codeAutoCloseablecode need to be idempotent, and those of codeCloseablecode not. Now when I have a look at the documentation of the a hrefhttpdocs.oracle.comjavase7docsapijavalangAutoCloseable.htmlcodeAutoCloseablecode interface at docs.oracle.coma, it saysp  blockquote   pNote that unlike the codeclosecode method of codeCloseablecode, this close method is not required to be idempotent. In other words, calling this codeclosecode method more than once may have some visible side effect, unlike codeCloseable.closecode which is required to have no effect if called more than once.p blockquote  pNow this is the opposite of what is written in the book. I have two questionsp  p1 What is correct The doc at docs.oracle.com or the book Which of the two interfaces requires idempotencep  p2 No matter which one needs to be idempotent  am I right that Java has actually no way at all to ensure that it is idempotent If so, the requirement of the codeclosecode method to be idempotent is something that the programmer strongshouldstrong do, but I can never be sure that someone who used the interface actually did do it, right In this case the idempotence is merely a suggestion of oracle, correctp

Negative 7992 pCame across a fairly strange bit of Safari behavior today. p  pSo I have a  element, with a poster attribute set. p  pIn Safari, the video is hidden when I visit the page in my dev environment localhost. I am able to see the video by either removing the poster attribute, or setting the zindex of the video element to be higher than anything else on the page. p  pThus it seems like whats happening is the video is stuck behind the poster image, but that should be impossible from what I understand of how the poster is supposed to work. p  pTo complicate matters further, this is not an issue in staging or live environments i.e. on an external web server  ONLY on localhost in dev. p  pThoughtsp
Negative 7992 pSo I use a ngif to cycle through the use of 6 different templates which each contain approx. 12 lines of html code.

That code looks likep  precodeapp.directivecard, function       return          restrict E,         scope              item ngModel                 app.directivetemplate1, function templates      return          replace true,         template templates.template1        app.directivetemplate2, function templates      return          replace true,         template templates.template2        app.directivetemplate3, function templates      return          replace true,         template templates.template3        app.directivetemplate4, function templates      return          replace true,         template templates.template4        app.directivetemplate5, function templates      return          replace true,         template templates.template5        app.directivetemplate6, function templates      return          replace true,         template templates.template6        app.factorytemplates, function       return          template1 ltnginclude srctemplate1.htmlgtltngincludegt,         template2 ltnginclude srctemplate2.htmlgtltngincludegt,         template3 ltnginclude srctemplate3.htmlgtltngincludegt,         template4 ltnginclude srctemplate4.htmlgtltngincludegt,         template5 ltnginclude srctemplate5.htmlgtltngincludegt,         template6 ltnginclude srctemplate6.htmlgtltngincludegt               codepre  pSo my main question here is, is there a code way to consolidate this code I had read some similar post, but they didnt give me quite was I was after. Seems somewhat repetitive the way it is now.p  pAdditionally, as I mentioned, my templates are each about 1215 lines of code times 6. For such small templates, is this best way to approach with angular in a view with less than 500 lines of code or should they be broken out into a single or multiple partials They wont be used in any other view at this point.p  pThanks much for the helpp

Negative 7992 pI have an OrientDB graph database with nodes connected in series with link of type codeNEXTcode. There are several distinct series in my data, and no node has more than one incoming and one outgoing NEXT link. The nodes all have a property called name. I would like to find all the sequences of name that occur in traversing the paths from start to end.p  pI.e. to get one sequence of names, start at a node which has no incoming NEXT link, follow the NEXT links until you have reached a node with no outgoing NEXT links, and gather up into a list all the names of the nodes you have passed. p  pe.g. a subgraph of form      codeBob[NEXT]gtSharon[NEXT]gtCarlcode should give the list      code[Bob, Sharon, Carl]codep  pFor clarification, here is a Cypher Neo4j query which gets me all the possible lists.p  precode    match start [NEXT]gt end,     p  shortestPathstart[NEXT]gt end     where not [NEXT]gtstart and not end[NEXT]gt     return extract s in nodesp  s.name  as path codepre  pHowever, I need to do this in OrientDB, which doesnt use Cypher.p  pI would like to know whether this is possible in OrientDB, and if so whether it is simpler in the SQL language or Gremlin.p  pAs a secondary question, ideally I would like to not return all the lists of names, because what I really care about is how often each list occurs. So instead I want to return the unique lists with how often that particular list was found. Is this possible to do in OrientDB, or would I have to retrieve all the path data from OrientDB as above and do the aggregation somewhere elsep

Is it okay that in the new codeMessagecode that will have multiple unused attributes based on type Is that inefficient in Parse.com Hypothetically, if codeMainMessagecode had way more say 10 attributes than codeChatMessagecode would this still be okay I believe the second approach is better because I can simplify the query for the feed. However, if there is anybody with anything to say on how I should be setting up the database, any comments are greatly appreciated. Thanks.p
