Positive 45272 pSo I have a home page that I created using HTML. I run it off my computer by opening the HTML file. Im trying to add a feature that allows me to edit it from the page using codecontenteditablecode or codeappendcode, not the source code. To achieve this, I came up with using codelocalStoragecode to hold the updated version of the webpage, and loading the page from that updated version. See a hrefhttpwww.developerdrive.com201206allowinguserstoedittextcontentwithhtml5 relnofollowherea. Theoretically, I would periodically update the source code from the codelocalStoragecode version so its all matched up.p  pHowever, when I tried it, my page wont update. I have a version saved into codelocalStoragecode, but it seems as if the program cant overwrite the that version, or something similar.p  pMy HTML looks like thisp  precodeltDOCTYPE htmlgt lthtmlgt  ltheadgt lttitlegtSCSS  Projectslttitlegt ltlink typetextcss relstylesheet hrefhome page heading style.cssgt ltlink typetextcss relstylesheet hrefhome page projects style.cssgt ltscript typetextjavascript srcsave script.jsgtltscriptgt ltscript typetextjavascript srcjquery.jsgtltscriptgt ltheadgt   ltbody onloadcheckEditsgt ltdiv ideverythinggt  ltdiv classboxgt lta hrefwho am i.htmlgtltdiv classimggtltimg srcwho am i.png gtltdivgtltagt ltdiv classwrappergt     ltdiv classtitlegtWho Am Iltdivgt     ltdiv classdescriptiongtA project for English class describing who I am through different medias and explained by unit questions.ltdivgt ltdivgt ltdiv classnotes contenteditabletruegtComplete.ltdivgt ltdivgt  lta href classbacktotop onclicksaveEditsgtSltagt  ltdivgtltEnd everythinggt ltbodygt codepre  pp  pMy JavaScript looks like thisp  precodefunction saveEdits   get the editable element var edited  document.getElementByIdeverything  get the edited element content var userVersion  edited.innerHTML  save the content to local storage var localStorage.Edits  userVersion    function checkEdits   find out if the user has previously saved edits iflocalStorage.Edits  null  document.getElementByIdeverything.innerHTML  localStorage.Edits   codepre  pBut my page doesnt actually work right it doesnt load the updated version.

Negative 45272 pWe have been working on a complex database and client interface for the last 18 months. We are regularly adding new functionnalities to this application, and it is now used by tens of users on a daily basis in all our offices, including sites and overseas. This is just to tell you it is a REAL application with a REAL database.p  pUntil now, we still did not have to write any stored procedures, except on a temporary basis to solve minor issues between client versions and updated database model where the old client version will not properly update the newly created field, until everybody installs the newest version.p  pIn the same way, we still did not need any triggers. In fact, the only SPs and triggers are the system ones, or the ones added for replication purpose.p  pI have the strange feeling that SPs and Triggers are mainly used to compensate for database design defaults andor attempts to bypass database design rules, when developers consider that database optimisation has to oppose database normalisation. p  pThe problem is that these tools are timeconsuming for both development or maintenance. Each developer shall then be very carefull using them, keeping in mind that they are the most expensive items to maintain in a database.p  pCould we consider that having none or few stored procedures  triggers in a database is a good indication of its normalisation level andor its code maintenance cost p  pEDIT p  pSome of you have supplied fair arguments for the use of both triggers and SPs. But I keep on thinking that strongemmost of the timeemstrong these tools are used in an improper or excessive way. How many triggers are set to make some fancy updates between table fields, or to recalculate totals or other aggregated data How many SPs are used to build temporary tables for reporting issues These are 2 among many situations where developers use these tools, and I think this usually illustrate database designnormalisation flaws.p  pSome others admit that use of SPs and triggers should be strictly controled. I find it necessary too.p  pI must confess that I am trying to find some upholding arguments, where all these SQL geeks working on our other databases look down at us, telling their friends You know what they do not even use SPs and Triggers Hahap

Negative 45272 pI am evaluating the prospect of developing a commercial java web application using Hibernate as the ORM framework.  This application would be installed on a customers server and would be used by a small number of users.  Also I do not want to release my source code since the application is mission critical and it would potentially jeopardize the security of the application.  p  pId design the application so if the customer has a enterprise database license already Id configure Hibernate to use that database.  Otherwise, ideally Id like to providerecommend a database for them.  Based on my current expertise Id prefer to use MySQL which is dual licensed commercially and under the GPL.  p  pAside from the Hibernate dialect settings I do not plan to have any MySQL specific code or SQL in my application.  Based on information on MySQLs website and many of the conflicting posts Ive read online, it would appear that if I want to distribute the application in this manner I would need to purchase a commercial license from MySQL.  The cost of a commercial license 600 a year from what I understand would make the software too expensive.  I feel that there must be other commercial web applications that allow similar functionality and are not bundled with a database.p  pThat brings me to these two questionsp  p1. Are there any known circumstances where you can use MySQL Community Edition with a commercial closed source application without paying a license fee  If so do you know of any commercial applications or companies that legally do thisp  p2. Ideally Id like to use the MySQL connector J driver which I believe is also dual licensed.  If I do not bundle this jar in my code and instead instruct the user to download the connector and download and install MySQL Server directly from MySQLs website is this permissible under the GPLp  pThere are a couple helpful posts already on Stack Overflow such as a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions620696mysqllicensingandgplhttpstackoverflow.comquestions620696mysqllicensingandgpla but I am looking for a more specific answer for my case.  I realize most of us are not lawyers but any guidance would be helpful so I can get past the legal issues and get started on the actual coding  Thanks.p

Negative 45272 pFor my university process Im simulating a process called random sequential adsorption. One of the things I have to do involves randomly depositing squares which cannot overlap onto a lattice until there is no more room left, repeating the process several times in order to find the average jamming coverage . p  pBasically Im performing operations on a large array of integers, of which 3 possible values exist 0, 1 and 2. The sites marked with 0 are empty, the sites marked with 1 are full. Initially the array is defined like thisp  precodeint i, j int n  1000000000 int array[n][n]  forj  0 j lt n j      fori  0 i lt n i              array[i][j]  0       codepre  pSay I want to deposit 55 squares randomly on the array that cannot overlap, so that the squares are represented by 1s. This would be done by choosing the x and y coordinates randomly and then creating a 55 square of 1s with the topleft point of the square starting at that point. I would then mark sites near the square as 2s. These represent the sites that are unavailable since depositing a square at those sites would cause it to overlap an existing square. This process would continue until there is no more room left to deposit squares on the array basically, no more 0s left on the arrayp  pAnyway, to the point. I would like to make this process as efficient as possible, by using bitwise operations. This would be easy if I didnt have to mark sites near the squares. I was wondering whether creating a 2bit number would be possible, so that I can account for the sites marked with 2. p  pSorry if this sounds really complicated, I just wanted to explain why I want to do this.p
Negative 45272 pOkay so Im trying to make a little gag program that will run away from the mouse.p  pSo, to get the mouse coordinates for the whole screen and not just the form control I had to create a little helperp  precodestatic class MouseHelper      [DllImportuser32.dll]     [return MarshalAsUnmanagedType.Bool]     internal static extern bool GetCursorPosref Point pt      public static Point GetPosition              Point w32Mouse  new Point         GetCursorPosref w32Mouse         return w32Mouse              codepre  pNow I thought I was going to use the MouseMove event... but that doesnt work for outside the form control either so I have an autoenabled timer on a 10ms loop called timerMouseMove.p  precodepublic partial class Form1  Form      public Form1              InitializeComponent           private bool CollisionCheck              Point win32Mouse  MouseHelper.GetPosition          if win32Mouse.X lt Location.X  win32Mouse.X gt Location.X  Width             return false          if win32Mouse.Y lt Location.Y  win32Mouse.Y gt Location.Y  Height             return false          return true           private void timerMouseMoveTickobject sender, EventArgs e              if CollisionCheck             Location  new PointLocation.X  1, Location.Y  1       codepre  pSo this works out nicely, at least I have the collision checking working and whatnot.   But now, how should I go about figuring which side of the form the mouse has collided with, so that I can update its location to move in the opposite direction the mouse collides with it  And such halpp

Negative 45272 pI have the following dilema My clients momnpop pawnshops have been using my mgmt. system, developed with ISQL, for over 20 years. Throughout these two decades, I have customized the app to each clients desire, or when changes in LawsRegulations have required it. Most clients are singleuser sites. Some have multiple stores, but have never wanted a distributed db, dont trust the reliability or security of the internet or any other type of networking. So, they all use Standard Engines. Ive been able to work around some SE limitations and done some clever tricks with ISQL and SE, but sooner or later, new laws may require images of pawnshop customers, merchandise, electronic transmision, etc. and then it will be time to upgrade to IDS, rewrite the app in 4GL or change to another RDBMS.

Negative 45272 pI read the memory management guide for the ObjectiveC language, but this is a doubt I still have, even after reading many times the chapter.p  pLets say I want to return an object I just created in a method of an object like thisp  precodeNSString ret  [[NSString alloc] initWithStringMy string] return ret codepre  pI can do this, but it is not correct according to the ownership policy. The guide states that the correct solution would be top  precodeNSString ret  [[NSString alloc] initWithStringMy string] return [ret autorelease] codepre  pbecause, as Im autoreleasing, Im no more the owner. My question is when will the NSString be actually released and deallocated When the last initialized pool is released This means that, if I dont create a pool, this object will be released when the application is closed the pool that xcode creates by default is released at the end. Is this correct The same applies to objects which are not allocated by me likep  precodeNSString ret  [NSString stringWithStringMy string] codepre  p If I dont create a pool to release it elsewhere, it is released at the end of the application when the pool created by xcode is released Thanks for any clarification.p

Negative 45272 pI would like to deflate a small block of memory lt 16 KiB using zlib. The output is stored in a block of memory as well. emNoem disk or database access here.p  pAccording to the documentation, I should call codedeflatecode repeatedly until the whole input is deflated. In between, I have to increase the size of the memory block where the output goes.p  pHowever, that seems unnecessarily complicated and perhaps even inefficient. As I know the size of the input, cant I predetermine the maximum size needed for the output, and then do everything with just one call to codedeflatecodep  pIf so, what is the maximum output size I assume something like size of input  some bytes overheadp

Negative 45272 pI am unclear on how to handle the following scenario...p  pAssume that you have a ViewController that needs to perform a long running operation.  The ViewController calls performSelectorInBackground to start the long running operation, which in turn will call performSelectorOnMainThread when it is done.  Now, assume that the View gets deallocated during the long running operation, perhaps because the user navigated backward in the UINavigationController.  When the background operation completes, it is going to try to send a message to a deallocated object.  p  pWhat is the best way to handle this It is in my requirements that the user must be able to abandon the screen during the operation, so preventing the backward navigation is not an option.p

Negative 45272 pIn the CortexM3 instruction set, there exist a family of LDREXSTREX instructions such that if a location is read with an LDREX instruction, a following STREX instruction can write to that address only if the address is known to have been untouched.  Typically, the effect is that the STREX will succeed if no interrupts exceptions in ARM parlance have occurred since the LDREX, but fail otherwise.p  pWhats the most practical way to simulate such behavior in the Cortex M0  I would like to write C code for the M3 and have it portable to the M0.  On the M3, one can say something likep  pre inline void doincunsigned int dat    whilestrexldrexdat1,dat   pre  pto perform an atomic increment.  The only ways I can think of to achieve similar functionality on the CortexM0 would be to eitherp  ol liHave ldrex disable exceptions and have strex and clrex reenable them, with the requirement that every ldrex must be followed soon thereafter by either a strex or clrex. liHave ldrex, strex, and clrex be a very small routines in RAM, with one instruction of ldrex being patched to either str r1,[r2] or mov r0,1.  Have the ldrex routine plug a str instruction into the strex routine, and have the clrex routine plug mov r0,1 there.  Have all exceptions that might invalidate a ldrex sequence call clrex. ol  pDepending upon how the ldrexstrex functions are used, disabling interrupts might work reasonably, but it seems icky to change the semantics of loadexclusive so as to cause bad sideeffects if its abandoned.  The codepatching idea seems like it would achieve the desired semantics, but it seems clunky.p  pBTW, side question I wonder why STREX on the M3 stores the successfailure indication to a register rather than simply setting a flag  Its actual operation requires four extra bits in the opcode, requires that a register be available to hold the successfailure indication, and requires that a cmp r0,0 be used to determine if it succeeded.  Was it expected that compilers wouldnt be able to handle a STREX intrinsic sensibly if they didnt get the result in a register  Getting Carry into a register takes two short instructions.p

So I would have a cache folder with files like google.txt and using fileputcontents insert httpwww.google.com into the google.txt file.p  pThe problem is that I want to actually track the ips, views, etc.. in the database, but I want to redirect the user as quickly as possible.

Negative 45272 pI am having some trouble formulating a solution for this foreseen situation.p  pTableA has a FK to TableB. TableC has a FK to TableA. TableC has a FK to TableD.p  precodeTableA  taId tbId  TableB  tbId  TableC  tcId taId tdId  TableD  tdId codepre  pA brief series of eventsp  pli1 A cascade softdelete is issued to a record in TableB. This causes all related records in TableA to be softdeleted, cascading to all related records in TableC being softdeleted. li2 At a later time, a record in TableD is softdeleted, cascading again. This record in TableD was held as a FK in TableC. However, TableC was already marked as softdeleted. li3 The record in TableB in step 1 is requested to be restored. p  pHow can I make sure that when restoring the related records to the restored record in TableB namely in TableA and TableC that I do not restore any which had a dependency on the record from Step 2, TableD  moreover, that in not restoring parts which had a dependency on the record from Table D, I restrict restoration in a cascading manner i.e. that TableA not be restored if TableC is found to have a relation to a softdeleted recordp  pWhat I have considered is leveraging a temporal design in the tables along with a GUID. Each table would have aside from a softdelete flag a DateDeleted field, and a GUID field where the same GUID would be assigned to each node in a cascade softdelete to distinguish the set of cascade. This would make it pretty easy to restore a cascaded set because they would share a date and a GUID. But the issue I came across, which is the one outlined above, was how to handle the situation where the softdeleted records would have been removed from a different cascade.p

Negative 45272 pI have been asked to improve the memory efficiency of an application that is used for high speed data acquisition. After running the VS memory profiler several times and scanning the projects for obvious issues I came to the following conclusion despite using a fixed size circular buffer for storing acquired sample points, the RAM usage increases relative to the polling period. For example polling data for one signal at 2 microseconds can use 5 times more memory private bytes than when running at 50 microseconds ... even though the buffer size is the same. p  pThe circular buffer is an array of SamplePoint objects. Each of these objects contains an array of Shorts 16 bit for corresponding data per signal and one date object 8 bytes for the time stamp. For efficiency, the circular buffer is Redimmed only once every time it begins polling and filled with empty sample points which are then assigned. p  pAlso, it seems that when we stop and run the application it hogs even more memory each time as though the Redim is not releasing the previous array. p  pMy questions boil down to the following p  pWhat is most memory efficient way of implementing a circular buffer containing managed objects which have arrays  Also, how and why is memory usage increasing with a fixed size array with different polling speeds  Does the garbage collector not have time Do local variables get disposed of IMMEDIATELY when a sub or function exitsp  pThese are some of the doubts and concerns that I would like to rule out before proceeding. Thank you for taking the time. Also, I could post code but it would be pointless as there is a lot of it and spread out.p  pEdit Here is some condensed code I wrote that reflects the initialization, population and reset of the circular buffer.

Negative 45272 pI am trying to write functional tests for an android application. The problem is that most functional testing frameworks that I have explored calabashandroid, robotium have a limitation on the number of activities from different applications that can be tested in the same test. So if in one workflow I need to select some contacts from the android contact picker I cant test that entire flow because the contact picker activity is part of the android contacts application and the framework cant test an activity from my application and the contacts application at the same time.p  pOne possible solution my team thought of was to mock out the call to the contacts activity to return a dummy intent with contact information so that our application workflow can be tested. We are trying to use mockito to achieve this. However I am stuck pretty early on. Here is what I am trying to dop  precodeMyActivity mockActivity  mockMyActivity.class whenmockActivity.startActivityForResultltgt,anyInt.thenReturnfakeIntent codepre  pI am not sure what to put in the first parameter in the second line. I have tried Intent.class and android.content.Intent.class however it throws a compile error. If anyone has worked with mocking activities using mockito, some help will be greatly appreciated.p  pP.S.  If I understand correctly mocking is used more in unit testing than functional testing. So these tests would be more of a hybrid. If anyone has a better suggestion on how to go about these functional tests on android I am all ears.p

Negative 45272 pI am currently working with Microsoft Visual Studio 2012 and the new Fakes framework. And after adding my unit tests to the MSBuild and continuous integration process, the Fakes unit tests happen to raise a ShimNotSupportedException.p  pI tried different stuff and read into that issue and found out that, this only happens when I run my tests from the Resharper feature, or directly in the code with MSTest. These exceptions DO NOT occur when running from the Test menu bar, which made me think about checking the setting files of this features.p  pAfter further research I found some articles where it says that it might has something to do with the code coverage setting specified in the Resharper or MSTest settings and if you switch that off, it solves the issue. a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions11632108shimnotsupportedexceptioninmsvisualstudio2012ShimNotSupportedException in MS VisualStudio 2012a also relates to that problem. p  pI also found some input on the MSDN about that issue, which confirmed me that it has to do something with the code coverage a hrefhttpsocial.msdn.microsoft.comForumsenUSvstestthread17fcfdc61cda4692a242656b48195327httpsocial.msdn.microsoft.comForumsenUSvstestthread17fcfdc61cda4692a242656b48195327a and a hrefhttpsocial.msdn.microsoft.comForumsenUSvstestthreadbfa792b0b3fc4a51b49df7aaf1f2f4b8httpsocial.msdn.microsoft.comForumsenUSvstestthreadbfa792b0b3fc4a51b49df7aaf1f2f4b8a.p  pNevertheless, since I have to implement code coverage into the continuous integration process somehow soon, and skipping that part is not an option, I am now asking here for any advice regarding this issue, and if there is any kind of solution to that problemp  pThanks for all advicep

Negative 45272 pI am creating an app where I am using MvvmCross on WP7 along with a Bing Maps control. I am trying to bind the codeMapItemsControlcode codeItemSourcecode to an codeObservableCollectioncode of codeLocationDataSourcecode, which contain a property codeMapPositioncode of the type codeGeoPointcode. codeGeoPointcode is a simple class which contain information about the Latitude and Longitude of the location. The locations which I populate into the codeObservableCollectioncode are fetched by a service which my codeViewModelcode listens to and updates the collection when it has fetched the locations. Though it does not seem to work as no locations are shown on the map. To bind the codeGeoPointcodes I have made a converter which simply converts to codeGeoCoordinatecode which the codeMapItemsControlcode understands.

Negative 45272 pI am attempting to write an FTP Client and I need to print out the server response to my commands. One of these commands is STAT. The server returns the response and as I understand it the response is in the socket buffer which I can read using the read command. The problem is I only need the response for STAT so I know it will end with END OF STATUS. This is the code I wrote to read the responsep  precodein  readconnFd, amptimebuffer, sizeoftimebuffer whileingt0     printfs, timebuffer     memsetamptimebuffer, 0, sizeof timebuffer     in  readconnFd, amptimebuffer, sizeoftimebuffer  memsetamptimebuffer, 0, sizeof timebuffer codepre  pThe problem I am getting is that once the read function goes through the buffer and finishes reading the while loop does not terminate and continues infinitely, my program just sits there. I assume it is because the read function is waiting for data so I was wondering if there is a way to tell read to stop once the end of the buffer is reached. I thought this would happen automagically since read would return something xlt1 but if it is waiting I understand what the problem is. So how would I fix it Is there a way to set up a timeout0 so it would only read data if it is there already Also I know there are flags that I set to 0 but I cant find much info on them. I appreciate any help. Would the only way be to check for END OF STATUS string in the buffer Would I use strstrbufferp

Negative 45272 pI am stumped on this problem and have come humbled to the experts on advice for my problem.p  pI have an ASP.NET MVC app that is Siteminder enabled. In addition, this app has a section of URLS that are web services which provide data to another application. Those URLS have been configured for bypass Siteminder authentication in the Siteminder setup. Ive double checked the bypass to make sure the Siteminder configuration is correct. I can enter those URLs in a browser and the JSON data is displayed without Siteminder authentication. bHowever....bp  pbThe problem is when I use HttpWebResponse, Stream and StreamReader to retrieve the JSON data when siteminder is enabled, I get the Siteminder login page HTML as the string when StreamReader.ReadToEnd is evoked instead of the JSON formatted databp  pThis is baffling because I another developer here can access the same web service and get the correct JSON formatted data in a PYTHON app. Also, I put it in a regular ASP.NET app so its not an MVC issue. I get the same result.p  pbIs there another class or library I should use Is there a configuration setting I need to pass to the web service call Any help would be greatly appreciated.bp  pHere is the code of one of the web service calls.p  precode        public static string GetData              string host  stringSystem.Configuration.ConfigurationManager.AppSettings[WEBSERVICEGET]         string URL  host  ApiGetData         var end  string.Empty          try                      HttpWebRequest request  WebRequest.CreateURL as HttpWebRequest              using HttpWebResponse response  request.GetResponse as HttpWebResponse             using Stream responseStream  response.GetResponseStream                              if response.StatusCode  HttpStatusCode.OK ampamp response.StatusCode  HttpStatusCode.Created                                      throw new HttpExceptionintresponse.StatusCode, response.StatusDescription                                    using StreamReader reader  new StreamReaderresponseStream                                      end  reader.ReadToEnd                     reader.Close                                   responseStream.Close                 response.Close                                  catch Exception ex                      EmailNotification.SendErrorEmailCould not get Data from WEBSERVICE  ex                   return end       codepre

Negative 45272 pI want to communicate between two different tabs in the same browser on the same domain.p  pWhen a specific event fires in the second tab, I change a localstorage variable value using Javascript. I want to detect this change on the first tab. The variable is named status and the value changes from 0 to 1p  pI was thinking for a possible solution and I think that using a timer on the first tab will work, but I think also that there must be a better way.p  pDo you know if there is any way to detect when the status variable value changes without using a timerp  pThanks a lotp

Negative 45272 pI have been searching all over the internet but still havent found a straight forward answer and  most importantly  not a decent example. I am using Universal Image Loader at the moment. strongI would like to know if it is possible to populate the Universal Image Loader using an Array or a List filled with url Strings which will be retrieved from my database.strongp  pAny help is appreciated, I would really like to keep using that Image Loader, because I think that the author of this library has put a lot of effort on it and If what I ask is doable, it will solve all my problems.p  pThanks in advance,  harrisp
Negative 45272 pI am making a kind of CMS system that works in sections of the webpage, and stores each one as a different entry into a table on a database with MySQL. When the user first sets up the page, the PHP script calls a function called codeaddsectionname, contentcode that adds the section to the database. However, to make this system more flexible, so it doesnt use static sections, I would like to be able to change the function to be codeaddsectionname, functioncode, where you give a function for the parameter codefunctioncode. Is there any way that I could store this function or function name in the database and then call it when the code needs to get the section text And if not, what would I be able to do instead The function that I use to get the content of the section is simply codesectionnamecode.br Also, does anybody know an easy way to redirect to another page if the current page has not been viewed before that doesnt use files or anythingp

Negative 45272 pI have a wordpress shop site with the headway theme being used. I have tried all sorts of caching plugins to no avail, the only cache that works well is the headway theme cache which is built in. So i really want to use it.p  pThe problem is when the cache is turned on when the first visit to the website is http it immediately creates a cached css file.

Negative 45272 pI have a project that uses the iOS 6s Social Framework to post to the users Facebook. All of a sudden, the client asks that I implement a delay between when the user posts the message and when the message is actually posted.

The Social Framework brings up a controller with the details of the wall post where the user can press a Post button.

Nonatomic doesnt guarantee this.pli lipNeither atomic nor nonatomic solve race conditions, where one thread is reading and two threads are writing. There is no way to predict what result the read operation will return. This needs to be solved by additional synchronization.pli lipNeither atomic nor nonatomic guarantee overall data integrity one thread could set one property while another thread sets a second property in a state which is inconsistent with the state of the first property. This also needs to be solved by additional synchronization.pli ol  pWhat make my eyebrow raise is that people are divided into two campsp  pstrongPro atomic It make sense to use codenonatomiccode only for performance optimization.strongp  pAnd if you are not optimizing, then you should always use atomic because of point 1. This way you wont get some complete crap when reading this property in a multithreaded application. And sure, if you care about points 2 and 3, you need to add more synchronizaion on top of it.p  pstrongAgainst atomic It doesnt make sense to use atomic at all.strongp  pSince atomic doesnt solve all the problems in a multithreaded application, it doesnt make sense to use it at all, since you will need to add more synchronization code on top of it anyway. It will just make things slower.p  pI am leaning to the proatomic camp, but I want to do a sanity check that I didnt miss anything.p
Negative 45272 pI am having an issue where Ive got an asp.net mvc4 application being published via web deploy to our staging server.

Negative 45272 pThis is my first time working with Java and tomcat and Im a little confused about how everything fits together  Ive googled endlessly but cant seem to wrap my head around a few concepts.p  pI have completed a Java program that outputs bufferedImages. My goal is to eventually get these images to display on a webpage.p  pIm having trouble understanding how my java file .java which is currently running in NetBeans interacts with a servlet andor JSP.p  pIdeally, a servlet or JSP not 100 clear on how either of those works. I mostly understand the syntax by looking at various examples, however could get my output the bufferedImages when the program runs and the HTML file could somehow interact with whatever they are doing so that the images could be displayed on the webage. Im not sure if this is possible. If anyone could suggest a general order of going about things, that would be awesome.p  pIn every exampletutorial i find, no one uses .java files  there are .classes in the WEBINF folder  it doesnt seem like people are using full on java programs. However, I need my .java program to run so that I can retrieve the output and use it on the webapp.p  pAny general guidance would be greatly appreciatedp

Negative 45272 pOkay, so quite a smile question that I am stuck with. I am attempting to make a HTML text box that when submitted, the text is thrown into a function and checked to see if there are any links. If there is a link, it is wrapped in anchor tags and made into a clickable link.p  pSo I got that part working, but I then created an edit function. So when an edit button is pressed on the comment, a popup is shown with the created comment. The value of the comment taken from an XML file is placed into the value of this edit text area. But the value of the links still has the anchor tags, so it looks extremely messy.p  pI am trying to make a function that runs over this comment and removes any anchor tags and just has the remaining text within the anchor tags.p  pSimple example, when a user posts a comment, with a link like www.stackoverflow.com, it will be saved in my XML document like sop  precodelta hrefwww.stackoverflow.comgtwww.stackoverflow.comltagt codepre  pIt also works for if the user posts the link with http at the beginning.p  pI am now trying to revert the link to normal text like it was before.p  pHere are both of my functions. The first one, codeconvertLinkcode works perfectly. codeconvertLinkEditcode is attempting to revert the process, but I am having no luck.p  precodefunction convertLinktext    var words  text.split    var newText      for var i  0 i lt words.length i      var word  words[i]     if word.indexOfhttp  0        word  lta href   word   gt  word  ltagt      else if word.indexOfwww.  0        word  lta href http  word   gt  word  ltagt           newText  word          return newText   function convertLinkEdittext    var words  text.split    var newText      for var i  0 i lt words.length i      var word  words[i]     if word.indexOfhref  0        if index of finds href, it means a link is coming up       Therefore, since everything is split at blank spaces,       after the next blank space will be the current text that needs saving           newText  word          return newText  codepre  pInside my non working function is comments on how I think it should be done, although I am not to sure on how to implement.p

Negative 45272 pi am making a app that tracks the user and tracks another user which in theory would be an animal. my app goes like this, you register a username and pass then when this is done the user can log into the map by reentering the correct username and password. This is where the issues begin. upon creation of the screen the map loads with the users current location and auto sends a sms to the animals phone to request gps details, this then sends back 2 sms messages, 1 containing the gps information. i have a SmsReceiver class which reads this information and extracts the longitude and latitude data, converts it into a double then passes it to the map activity to be converted into a lnglat variable and displayed on the google map with a marker. Now the issue i am having is that it can take several minutes for the sms to return with the gps information, when this is done and the intent is used to send the coordinates to the map page a button must be clicked so that the longitude and latitude are combined into the AnimalCoordinate and the marker is shown, however because og the time gap its imposible to press the button at the same time the sms is retrieved and it causes a crash as the data is being sent from the smsreceiver class to nothing on the other side, and if i take the intent out of the onclick method the same thing happens but in reverse, the map runs the intent but the informaion is not there yet and it crashes. any help would be greatly appreciated as this has been a nightmare.p  pi am also sorry if i overcomplicated the explanation, i wanted to ake sure it was explained as best i could. the code is below for the two classes.p  precodeMap class  public class MainScreen extends FragmentActivity implements LocationListener  private GoogleMap map private LocationManager locationManager private String provider final Context context  this       Override    protected void onCreateBundle savedInstanceState      super.onCreatesavedInstanceState     setContentViewR.layout.activitymainscreen     map  SupportMapFragmentgetSupportFragmentManager.     findFragmentByIdR.id.map.getMap      LocationManager service  LocationManager getSystemServiceLOCATIONSERVICE     boolean enabledGPS  service             .isProviderEnabledLocationManager.GPSPROVIDER     boolean enabledWiFi  service             .isProviderEnabledLocationManager.NETWORKPROVIDER       Check if enabled and if not send user to the GSP settings     if enabledGPS          Toast.makeTextthis, GPS signal not found, Toast.LENGTHLONG.show         Intent intent  new IntentSettings.ACTIONLOCATIONSOURCESETTINGS         startActivityintent           locationManager  LocationManager getSystemServiceContext.LOCATIONSERVICE      Define the criteria how to select the locatioin provider gt use      default     Criteria criteria  new Criteria     provider  locationManager.getBestProvidercriteria, false     Location location  locationManager.getLastKnownLocationprovider       Initialize the location fields     if location  null          Toast.makeTextthis, Selected Provider   provider,                 Toast.LENGTHSHORT.show         onLocationChangedlocation      else           do something           Sets the map type to be hybrid     map.setMapTypeGoogleMap.MAPTYPEHYBRID      Bundle b  getIntent.getExtras       double lat   location.getLatitude     double lng  location.getLongitude     Toast.makeTextthis, Location   lat,lng,             Toast.LENGTHLONG.show     LatLng Usercoordinate  new LatLnglat, lng     Marker User  map.addMarkernew MarkerOptions     .positionUsercoordinate     .titleYou are here     .iconBitmapDescriptorFactory.fromResourceR.drawable.iclauncher     Move the camera instantly to user with a zoom of 15.     map.moveCameraCameraUpdateFactory.newLatLngZoomUsercoordinate, 15       Zoom in, animating the camera.     map.animateCameraCameraUpdateFactory.zoomTo18, 2000, null      Sends sms to animal phone       String phoneNo         String sms  GPSLocation        try          SmsManager smsManager  SmsManager.getDefault         smsManager.sendTextMessagephoneNo, null, sms, null, null         Toast.makeTextgetApplicationContext, SMS Sent,                     Toast.LENGTHLONG.show        catch Exception e          Toast.makeTextgetApplicationContext,             SMS faild, please try again later,             Toast.LENGTHLONG.show         e.printStackTrace               public void maphelpView view      method for the help button      AlertDialog.Builder alertDialogBuilder  new AlertDialog.Builder             context           set title         alertDialogBuilder.setTitleHelp           set dialog message         alertDialogBuilder      .setMessageClick the Pet button to display the pets location.

Negative 45272 pOk so I have managed to do this once before but I simply cannot remember how or find the source I found back then. I am making a simple flash game. There are several characters moving. To make each level more difficult than the other I have decided to alter the movement speed of each character from level to level. If I declare and assign values to these variables on my main timeline in frame 1 it doesnt work the way I want it. When you go to level 2, which is in another frame, the speed goes up like it should. But when you go to the next level, which is level 1 with higher movement speed, the value assignment is processed again, which means the movement speed goes back to scratch.p  precodeframe 1 var speedint  5 level accomplished, speed, goto frame 2  frame 2 level accomplished, speed, goto frame 1 codepre  pAnd then all the code on frame 1 runs again, setting the value of speed back to 5.p  pI have tried putting the variable in a class, but the problem is still the same, everytime it goes back to frame 1 the code var speedSpeed  new Speed runs again and the value of the variable goes back to whatever I assigned in the speed.as file.p  pI have tried so many different combinations to just make the global variables inside a package but outside any class so that it is always globally accessible without creating a new object.p  pHere is my current codep  precodespeed.as package  public var speedint  5   game.fla import speed  tracespeed codepre  pThis throws the error Access of possibly undefined property speed...p  pAs I said, I have tried many different combinations and got a lot of different errors, been googling and digging for 89 hours and its driving me crazy. You guys are now my last hope, I would be very grateful for an answer easily telling me how to use my global variables I know global variables are bad, seen a lot of people writing it even though I dont really know why, if there is another easy and better solution please do tell, but I dont want to rewrite the entire code or anything to make it compatible with some other solution. I know that global variables will solve this problem for me, I just dont know how to use them.p  pI will need instructions on what to do in both the .as file and the .fla file. Thanks in advancep

Negative 45272 pThis might not even be an AngularJS question and could just be an AJAX question. Im new to the developer side of the frontend so bear with me.p  pWhen making an AJAX call to fetch JSON data, where does the logic behind what data is returned and viewed fall In my mind, there would be a couple of possibilities and I want to understand which is the proper choice and why.p  pLets use an example of searching and playing a Youtube video.p  ol lipThe logic could fall to the backend controller, where the JSON is rendered based on some logic to give you a JSON file with exactly the right data. i.e. you search cat videos and when making an AJAX call, the JSON file you pull has been rendered to be only cat videos.pli lipThe opposite end would be that the Angular controller has the logic. This would imply that all data is called cat videos along with everything else... music videos, funny videos, tutorials, and so on and then sorted through on the client side. This, to me anyway, would be more inefficient  slow for the client, so doesnt seem to make sense. I suppose still might do some filtering of the data on the client side though. So, maybe a search for cat videos wouldnt return ALL videos, but definitely all cat videos and any filtering based on, say,  of views, video length, and so on would be done on the client side vs. calling the database again for a new set of videos.pli lipNot sure if this is accurate, but could you have logic in your factory to return only a portion of the data However, I believe the entire JSON file would need to be rendered, but only portions would be returned. I guess depending on where the JSON file renders i.e. backend or frontend this could be similar to either option 1 or 2.pli ol  pOr maybe Im misunderstanding things entirely and the way this works is entirely differentp  pIm basically looking to figure out how the scenarios of 1. user searches a term and results are shown, 2. user clicks a search result and now more detailed data of the result is on its own page. And how this ends up working out. Im looking for help with AngularJS, but I think this ultimately an AJAX question single page app or not more than anything.p

Negative 45272 pTrying to summarize in as few of words as possiblep  pI am trying to create a system that tracks the various products an individual can sell and the commission percentage they earn on that particular item. I am thinking about creating reference integers for each product called levels which will relate to their commission percentage in a new lookup table instead of a single reference point.. Is this overkill though or are there any benefits over just placing inline for each recordp  pMy gut tells me there are advantages of design 1 below but not sure what they are the more I think about it. If I need to update all individuals selling product X with level Y, indexes and replaces make that easy and fast ultimately in both methods.

When I did that, the runtime started telling me that fileProcessor was not serializable.  Ive tried to make it serializable, but the message is still there.  p  pThere are three different bean classes and four different beans loaded under fileProcessor Ive been over all of them to ensure they are serializable, but the message still appears.  The message also appears to indicate that the log4j Logger is the nonserializable entity, but I cant see how that is.  I made it transient in one pass, no difference.p  pThe standard answers to the serializable problem I find on SO and elsewhere involve moving making a call within the job bean to the job execution context, passing in the reference through SchedulerContextAsMap.  But, as near as I can tell, this depends on having globally unique names for the parameters to which to load the globally unique bean names, which doesnt work as I have this set up.  I reuse the parameters since I reuse the bean itself.p  pIm new to Spring design, but I thought this was the way it was supposed to work  reusable components, configured with XML to avoid having similar classes slightly modified to do different things.  So how can I make my 4 jobs work  Do I have to copyandpaste them, then slightly modify the names so theyre different, and unique in the configuration  Or is there some other piece I am missing and can use herep

Negative 45272 pI may be completely missing the point here but I have the following method to print out the args in a cpp program in visual studiop  precodeint tmainint argc, char argv[]       char fu  Bar      stdcout ltlt Test,  ltlt argc ltlt ,  ltlt argv[0] ltlt ,  ltlt argv[1] ltlt ,  ltlt fu ltlt endl         printfs, s, s, argv[0], argv[1], fu     return 0  codepre  pThe problem I am having is it only seems to print the first character of the args and not the whole string.p  pFrom what I can tell, argv[0] dereferences the argv array to get a char, and this is what I am passing into the coutprintf functions. They should then print all the characters up to a 0 character.p  pI created the test char fu to see if the problem was with passing in a char to the functions, but Bar is successfully printed.p  pThe only thing I can think is because the size of fu is known at compile time and the size of argv isnt something funny is going on with the way it is compiled.p  pI know I can print out the contents by looping through the characters but this seems to defeat the point, for example what if I want to work with the strings for comparison or something.

From the project descriptionp  blockquote   pIm looking to add a module on www.videocontractor.com and www.photocontractor.com that will enable visitors to the sites to add their business listing. Im not sure if this can be done. Im would like the javascript in the index.html file to be updated by site visitors. I think a PHP solution is needed. Im open to other ideas.p blockquote  pCan someone on here tell me yes or no if I can add the functionality that has been somewhat described above Are there any alternatives I should look into that would provide me with the same end result. p  pa hrefhttpswww.freelancer.comprojectsPHPJavascriptPHPJavaforbusinessdirectory.html relnofollowhttpswww.freelancer.comprojectsPHPJavascriptPHPJavaforbusinessdirectory.htmlap

The problem is Im trying to create a new entity in the database, with a db generated identity property, in LINQ to SQL and then create another entity associated with the first one.

Negative 45272 pI volunteer for a nonprofit with an interesting issue that I suspect is a common one.

I found a problem that I thought was similar at a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions9519673whydoesgoogleloadcausemypagetogoblankWhy does google.load cause my page to go blanka so I tried to do setTimeoutfunction google.loadvisualization, 1.0, packages[corechart], 100 The problem with this solution was that if the delay is too low, the page will return with no errors, but it will be completely blank however, if I set the delay too high, the page will just not load the package and the Javascript will break at p  precodevar data  new google.visualization.DataTable codepre  pwhen I call the function. Additionally, that poster stated problem with document.write, but I have no issues if I add document.write lines before or after I add the content to the page. I would appreciate it if anyone knew how to get Google Charts to work with Wkhtmltopdf and could help me.p  hr  pOk, In an attempt to give the API more time to load, I moved where I call the function to the end of the PHP. Now, it just sets an array of elements that need graphs drawn in them and the proper values, then it calls the function with the value from the arrays. I am not sure what the problem is now though because it is breaking on codechart.drawdata, optionscode now. It appears to be getting the correct values and element passed to it though.p  pThis will seem really roundabout since it is. For whatever reason, Wkhtmltopdf cannot read anything I put in a javascript tag. I have tried everything I can to get it to read it, but it just will not haha. The CakePDF plugin can read Javascript though, so my JS code is in the default PDF layout. Then in the actual view that is rendered by WkhtmltoPdf, I create an array of elements and values. I then do this after many different possible solutions, this is the only way I was able to call the JS functionp  precodefor i  0 i lt sizeofgradearray i      element  gradearray[i][2]     echo ltscript typetextjavascriptgtdrawCharttrue, .thisgtJsgtvaluegradearray[i][0]., .thisgtJsgtvaluegradearray[i][1].,.jsonencodeelement.ltscriptgt  codepre  pIt appears to pass all of the correct data. Upon calling the function, I have debug lines printing the parameters, and all parameters are correctly printed. I also noticed that if I do document.writetest in the same place as the chart.draw, it will write test without any error. For some reason, if I do chart.draw, it just says Wkhtmltopdf didnt return any data.p

Negative 45272 pFor my Senior project I am trying to find the best way to create a grid of up to 1000 x 1000 images and save as a pngtiffpsdbmpetc I prefer png with the ability for the alphatransparency. I am trying to use as little memory as possible so the best would be to stream the images directly to the file.p  pThe main question is what is the best way to stream a bunch of BufferedImage to filep  pI was thinking of doing 1 row of photos at a time then stream to the file and repeating, that way the only things loaded into memory is 1 row at a time.p  pHowever, I am having trouble finding examples that streams BufferedImages to a file one after another.p  pAny help would be greatly appreciated.p
Negative 45272 pSo I want to convert a byte array returned by the DatagramPackets getData function into a string. I know the way to convert the whole byte array to string is justp  precodeString str  new Stringbytes codepre  pHowever, this prints out null characters at the end. So if the byte array was p  precode[114, 101, 113, 117, 101, 115, 116, 0, 0, 0] codepre  pThe 0s print out empty boxes on the console. So I basically only want to print outp  precode[114, 101, 113, 117, 101, 115, 116] codepre  pSo I made this functionp  precodepublic void printDatagramPacket d          byte[] data  d.getData         forint i0 ilt d.getLength i              ifdata[i]  0                 System.out.println data[i]                codepre  pBut unfortunately this is printing out the actual numbers instead of the letters. So how can I convert each individual byte to a string and print that out. Or if there is another way to print the byte array without the nulls at the end then thatll be fine too.p

Negative 45272 pI am having a problem with a Java code that is using SimJava simulation library. The library basically helps with creating independent entities that can run as a java thread. The problem I am having is that I have a code segment that is used as the body of each of the entities that are running as a thread. These entitiesthreads are sharing an event that transfers a ConcurrentLinkedQueue between these threads. I used the concurrentlinkedqueue as I had problems with LinkedList concurrency control. The problem is that if I run the model for 100 repetitions or less, it works fine. If i go 100 or more i get a null pointer exception for the concurrent queue. Here is the code segment of the body that has the problem.p  pNull pointer exception happens at the line where I am trying to pull from queue even though the line before is checking if the queue is empty or null. The exception is thrown at the line  nextNode  dcPath.poll.intValuep  pFor some reason the poll call is returning a null and the intValue is being applied to a null object. My question is that how is this possible with the if statement before is already checking for the queue content How can I control this race conditionp  precodepublic void body     synchronized this   ConcurrentLinkedQueueltIntegergt dcPath  new ConcurrentLinkedQueueltIntegergt        int nextNode   int distance  0   while Simsystem.running      Simevent e  new Simevent     simgetnexte     Get the next event     dcPath  ConcurrentLinkedQueueltIntegergt e.getdata     if dcPath  null ampamp dcPath.isEmpty       nextNode  dcPath.poll.intValue  THIS LINE IS THROWING NPE Exception       if dcPath  null ampamp dcPath.isEmpty         int outPort  findMatchingOutPortdcPath.peek.intValue         if outPort  1           simscheduleout[outPort], 0.0, 0, dcPath            distance  this.calculateSensorToSensorDistance out[outPort].getdest                                          codepre

Negative 45272 pSorry for the cryptic subject but summarizing what this is about, is kind of hard. So please bear with me for a moment...p  pI am working on an application that is designed to be highly modular and extendable by means of plugins. So basically you have models that are stripped down to a bare minimum of data and behavior the common set while the rest can come in via plugins.p  pFor example An admin creates instances of a model through the admin. Some require just the basics but others do require special behavior and some extra data, thus he adds plugins to those.p  pWhat jumps to mind is model inheritance for the plugins. But since it is unforeseeable how many plugins an installation will have and how many a specific model instance will have attached to it or what kind of plugins since the plugin system is heterogenous, performance is a great concern of mine.p  pEach time a model is utilized for a sites visitor, every plugin needs to get evaluated.p  pThus I want to make sure that I get everything for a model with 1 query instead of several. This naturally can result in quite a lot of joins, actually at least ON with N being the number of plugins that the system has installed for a specific model type. This alone worries me about the scalability and feasibility of such a system.p  pSo Id like to ask the community for advice if my concerns are justified and if this is a sound approach By the way, after having implemented my own solution, I came across the InheritanceManager from djangomodelutils which is what is used now for the downcasting part if that matters.p  pRight now I am also thinking about possible alternatives without loosing the flexibility of the plugin system itself which is a necessityp  pInstead of saving each plugin to its own table, the plugin system could be designed to utilize just one table with all the common plugin meta data saved as columns and the rest is being serialized to JSON and saved as such in another column. Thus, one could very easily get all plugins for a model and only had to construct the plugin model manually with the serialized data. This would work just fine with heterogenous and homogenous plugins. Naturally a plugin and the overall system looses some options when it comes to querying the database for specifics of a plugins serialized data. Also there are ACID constraints like not being able to atomically increment a single field. But those limitations would be fine and could also be overcome if a plugin required it by means of a dedicated data model for example.p  pAgain, Id kindly ask for advice if this would be a more scalable approach compared to my initial solution above or if this is something that just stinks of problems and should be avoided at all costs p  pThanks in advance for any help and hints in advance. It is very much appreciated...p  pLast but not least, full disclosure I posted this question to the djangousers list as well. I hope this is okay.p  h2strongUPDATE 1strongh2  pI realized I never made it really quite clear that my application is based on Django 1.6 and thus Im aiming to be as db agnostic as possible excluding sqlite, even though personally I only use PostgreSQL.p

Negative 45272 pSo I just checked out an Android project a colleague of mine checked in where codegradle.xmlcode was set up with realtive paths in the codemodulescode section though the use of codeMODULEDIRcode.

Negative 45272 pBasically, my program records user input via the microphone and store it as a .pcm file in the sdcard directory. Itll be overwritten should there be an existing one. The file is then later sent for playback and analysis mainly FFT, RMS computation.p  pI have added another function which allows the program to record system audio, so it allows users mp3 files to be analyzed as well. It streams the system audio and store it as a .pcm file for later playback and analysis.p  pIts all functioning well. However, theres a slight issue, when the program streams audio, it captures input from the mic and therell be noises in the playback. I do not want this as itll affect the analysis reading.

The rules for the combinations are as followsp  ul liThere are a total of N gamesli liEach game has 3 possible outcomes win, lose, or drawli liEach outcome has positive or negative scoreli ul  pFind the top outcome combinations of size N in order to maximize the total scorep  pFor example, with N  2p  precodeGame 1, Outcome 1  3 points Game 1, Outcome 2  1 points Game 1, Outcome 3  3 points  Game 2, Outcome 1  3 points Game 2, Outcome 2  1 points Game 2, Outcome 3  3 points codepre  pWith these 2 games and point values for each possible outcome, here is the ordered list of combinations I would expect to see. Note that combinations 4, 5, and 6 are ties so they could have been in any order here.p  precodeCombination 1  Game 1, Outcome 1  Game 2, Outcome 3 gt Total 6 points Combination 2  Game 1, Outcome 1  Game 2, Outcome 2 gt Total 4 points Combination 3  Game 1, Outcome 2  Game 2, Outcome 3 gt Total 2 points Combination 4  Game 1, Outcome 1  Game 2, Outcome 1 gt Total  0 points Combination 5  Game 1, Outcome 2  Game 2, Outcome 2 gt Total  0 points Combination 6  Game 1, Outcome 3  Game 2, Outcome 3 gt Total  0 points Combination 7  Game 1, Outcome 3  Game 2, Outcome 2 gt Total 2 points Combination 8  Game 1, Outcome 2  Game 2, Outcome 1 gt Total 4 points Combination 9  Game 1, Outcome 3  Game 2, Outcome 1 gt Total 6 points codepre  pI can compute these ordered combinations by brute force for small values of N, but given that there are a total of 3N combinations and that N can be as large as 128, I dont expect brute force to work for very long. So, I am looking for a way to identify the first M combinations, where M ltlt the total number 3N of combinations.p  pIve spent quite a bit of time trying to come up with an algorithmic way to pick these combinations but Im coming up short. Id appreciate any suggestions that point me in the right direction.p  pThanksp

Negative 45272 pI can not understand why following setup gives me the Inequality constraint ambiguity error. The general idea although simplified in this question is to pin the View to the top and left, give it fixed height and variable width. Thus, 4 constraints have been added 3 with equal values for top, left and height and 1 with less than or equal. And it gives me that error. Finally, what I am trying to achieve, is to put other new to the right of this View, and specify the spacing between them. So, whenever Left view changes the width, the right View will change the X.p

Negative 45272 pIm an sql newbie and Im confused about using stored procedures. p  pWhat I have are two tables, a users table and a registrations table with a one to many relationship between the two. In simplest terms, I want to output a list of users with a count of their registrations. I know how to do this with a left join. However, the select on the registrations is getting somewhat messy and Id like to have it be cleaner.p  pWhat I would really like is select users.name, getCountusers.id from users and have all the logic for counting the registrations in the getCount stored procedure. But Im not finding any docs for doing it this way. Is this possible or does getCount go into a left join or is this just not what stored procedures are forp

Negative 45272 pI need some advice on how to get a VB.NET form to return a value from a C form.p  pUnfortunately converting the VB project to C would simply take to long.p  pBoth are completely separate projects they are independent of each other and not in the same solution.p  pBasically the C app has 3 parameters nRoll,nPitch,nYaw they are declared as integers. I would like my VB project to be able to get these 3 values so they can be used in the VB form.p  pIs it possible to do this with separate projects or would I have to look at doing something more complex like adding the VB project into the C solution and passing the parameters like you would with normal forms, would this work p  pEverything I have found on the web seems to tell me that this is not possible without compiling one of the projects into a DLL and referencing it to be able to parse the values between the two projects. However I dont particularly want to do this as I may end up finding I have wasted time if it does not work.p  pThe other method I have thought of is silly and inefficient but I could simply write the 3 values from the C project to a text document and then parse the values in VB to use them provided this is possible without getting a file in use error. p  pSo if anyone has knowledge in doing this could you please guide me through the procedure since its only 3 values I need I am looking for the most simplest method. Any help would be greatly appreciated.p  pThanks Callum p

Negative 45272 pstrongemBACKGROUNDemstrong br Im helping a 3rd party host 3 apps that they paid me to write theyve given me access to their Apple credentials  created expressly for this app  in order to manage the iTunesConnect process.p  pBecause of this, I get access to all of the sales data, etc. through iTunesConnect. We currently have all 3 apps released, two of which are firsttime releases and one of which has been on the store for a few months and updated a couple of times. The first app was initially released with a 1.99 price point as an introductory price, which went up to 3.99 after about a month.p  pstrongemACTUAL QUESTIONemstrongbr I just got my daily report from AppFigures.com highly recommended, by the way its a relatively cheap way to get a good amount of automated data and analytics about app sales, and I noticed that app 1 had 3 refunds yesterday. Weve only had 7 refunds ever, and all 3 of these refunds were originally purchased at the 1.99 price point. Therefore, this has made me very curious as to why they got the refund NOW. We had bugs earlier on that have subsequently been resolved by updates, so I dont understand why someone would have a legitimate reason to ask for and receive a refund at this point.p  pstrongPlease notestrong Im fully aware that Ill never get the information to tie back directly to the user. I understand why, but its a bit of a shame and its why we included a voluntary contactfeedback mechanism in the app itself. Im just wondering if I can see from Apple the reason they selected for requesting the refund. p  pBasically, Id like to answer the following questionp  pWhy did Apple think it was justified to refund this users moneyp  pIm guessing it would be a helpful piece of information for us if theres something wrong with the app and were not aware, this could help us fix it. Does anybody know howif that information is availablep

Negative 45272 pWe have been running a browser strategy game for about 5 years. Our animated water worked for a couple of years but is suddenly broken in chrome. Still works in other browsers. The bug showed up in chrome canary developer version of chrome a few months back, and now also in normal chrome.p  pHere is a example of how our css looks like     backgroundurlver101terrainwater128patt.gif 384px 320px,      urlver101terrainwaterwbase.png 384px 320px      width64px height64pxp  pHere is what it looks like in the browser a hrefhttpwww.warbarons.comtestwater.html relnofollowhttpwww.warbarons.comtestwater.htmlap  pThe first background layer have a animated gif where each frame only contain the pixels that are changed, the rest is transparent. The next background layer is a static image of water. The result is a optimized gif animation of water where we dont need to hold information that doesnt change in every frame of the gif.p  pThe problem that we have now is that the second layer is not displayed. If I put a transparent static PNG image in the first layer the second layer is drawn, but not with the animated gif.p  pWe have been running this game for a long time with no problem, and the interesting part now is that it worked in chrome until we cleared our cache after getting complaints from our players. This would make it seem like we have changed something the broke it but it still works in firefox after clearing cache, and all our older versions of the game that we havent touched are also broken now in chrome. It seems to me that this is a bug introduced in chrome, but Im probably wrong. Any suggestion to get this back working would be great for us and our players who are suffering from flashing disco water.p

Negative 45272 pIm facing the following task in ArcGIS  Im using ArcMap 10.2 I have a polygon shapefile with counties of say a state in US. From this shapefile, I create a layer which marks all counties in which there is at least 1 city of more than 50000 inhabitants I think of this as the treatment condition. Then Im creating buffers around the polygons in my layer of counties with those large cities, i.e. Im drawing a buffer of say 100km around every county that has at least one city with more than 50000 inhabitants.  So far so goodp  pThe final step of this exercise should be to create a count for every polygon with the number of buffers that are touching this polygon. For instance, the buffers around counties B, C and D all touch county A. However county A doesnt have a city of more than 50000 inhabitants. Hence, I want the count for city A to be 3 its touched by B, C and D. I created the union of all my buffers but I simply cant find the right way to create this count for every polygon.  Ive done an extensive Google search and Im apologize if I overlooked the obvious solution. p  pAny help is appreciatedp  pMichael Kaiser [Staff Research Assistant UCSD]p

When I try to run the AsyncTask, it always crashes at some point in code of doInBackground. Sometimes its on url.openConnection, sometimes at httpurlconection.getInputStream, sometimes at ifstreamnullstream.close, sometimes at some other random point in code. On very rare occasions the AsyncTask can finish itself, but crashes on the next request anyway.p  pThe main loop is just waiting for the AsyncTask process to stop, by running a volatile boolean in whileXMLreaderAsyncTask.parsingnotCompletep  pThe kicker is that I use a DefaultUncaughtExceptionHandler to write a TXT file report on all crashes, but it doesnt worktrigger for this type of crash. It works fine if I trigger it by going out of bounds of an array, but not for what is causing the crash of the AsyncTask XML reader.p  precodepublic static Thread.UncaughtExceptionHandler androidDefaultUEH  Override protected void onCreateBundle savedInstanceState          super.onCreatesavedInstanceState ...  androidDefaultUEH  Thread.getDefaultUncaughtExceptionHandler Thread.setDefaultUncaughtExceptionHandlernew Thread.UncaughtExceptionHandler      Write a TXT report file androidDefaultUEH.uncaughtExceptionparamThread, paramThrowable  ...  codepre  pI cant get eclipse to detect the phone as plugged in, so I cant get the LogCat report.

In my opinion the togglePanel is not the item, which needs the form because its switch type is client not server and ajax, which need form tags. But the command link does need the form tag, because if I remove it, an error occurs saying this link is disabled as it is not nested within a jsf form. p  pSo I tried to replace the commandLink with a commandButton. This worked fine first and the form wasnt necessary anymore. But somehow the behaviour is completely random now. Sometimes the tables can be expanded, sometimes nothing happens when i click the expand button. When i add form tags again, it works fine, but doesnt solve my ViewExpiredException.p  pHope, somebody can help me out here...p  pThanks for your helpp  pBuntspechtp

Negative 45272 pIm working on an MVC5 application. On the home screen is a grid allowing users to view Data and be transferred to a number of Views for various actions on each record. One of these is an [EDIT].p  pThe issue Im encountering is as follows due to the amount of data it is convenient to Filter the data down say to a specific location and then Edit records from there. The filter on this grid Grid.MVC from CodePlex performs filtering partially by modifying the URL a hrefhttphomeURLgridfilterLocation.DEPT1accounting relnofollowhttphomeURLgridfilterLocation.DEPT1accountinga such as 1 being Equals, 2 being Cotains, 3 being StartsWith, and 4 being EndsWith and then after the next 2 underscores being the search criteria. p  pThis functions fine, however upon [POST] return from the Edit the user currently is returned to main Index view without the filtering criteria still set forcing them to go in over and over and add filtering criteria before performing the similar EDIT on records of the same criteria.p  pMy POSTEDIT method is currently setup to includep  precode        if ModelState.IsValid                      collection.MODIFIEDDATE  DateTime.Now             collection.MODIFIEDBY  System.Environment.UserName              db.Entrycollection.State  EntityState.Modified             await db.SaveChangesAsync             return RedirectToActionIndex, Home          codepre  pFor my attempts I had first thought to return the View with the updated collection codereturn Viewcollectioncode but this of course just takes me back to the EDIT view, not the home view with the data grid filtered down as previously specified. I considered adding a field in the database, something like LASTFILTEREDURL, but this just feels like an overgrown bandaid. p  pDoes anyone know of a clean way to go about thisp  hr  pstrongEDITstrongp  pI had thought to do something similar to Andreas suggestion early on, but had not thought of doing an explicit redirect with the Parameter of the urlfilter passed in the Redirect.

Currently I am working on the Dijkstra Algorithm.p  pSo, I have made my own codeHeapcode class which works as a minpriority queue for the implementation of the Dijkstra algorithm. Since, in the Dijkstra algorithm, you need to update the distance of a vertex strongwhich is already in the heapstrong, from the source vertex in the Graph, if its distance is less than its current distance, and then accordingly adjust the values in a Heap. p  pFor this, I need to keep an codeint position[]code array to keep a track of the positions at which the elements are currently in the codeHeapcodep  pThis is my Vertex Class p  precode    class Node     public         int data         int weight          .....          friend intamp operator []int a, Node i              return a[i.data]               codepre  pMy codeminPriorityQueuecode class p  precodetemplate lttypename tgt class minPriorityQueue      int size, currentPosition     int position     t data     bool comparet data1, t data2 public     minPriorityQueueint size, bool func1t data1, t data2, int position          thisgtsize  size         currentPosition  1         data  new t[size]         compare  func1         thisgtposition  position          ........      void swapPositionValueint parent, int temp          int tempPosition  position[data[parent]]         position[data[parent]]  position[data[temp]]         position[data[temp]]  tempPosition               ......  codepre  pSince my vertices are code0,1,2,3, ...code So, I try to overload the code[]operatorcode of my codeVertexcode class so that it returns me the codedatacode of the current vertex which is one from code0,1,2,3 ...code, so I can use it to access that index of the codepositioncode array.p  pI get the compilation error  codeerror int operator[]int, graphVertex must be a nonstatic member functioncode Well, since I get this error I assume that it must have been specified in the standard that I cannot overload the code[]operatorcode using a friend function, but strongwhy I cannot do it Does it lead to any ambiguitystrong I dont see what can be ambiguous in what I am currently using.p  pSecondly, is there any way I can swap the values in my codepositioncode array My codeminPriorityQueuecode class is a generic class which I am using at several other places at my code as well.

So, I need to update the Nodes in the Heap, and then I need to move them to their correct positions, according to their new weights To update their weights, I need to know at what position are the Nodes located in the codeHeapcode, and the position is decided by the codedatacode of the codeNodecode. So, overloading the code[]operatorcode was just a small way out for me, so that when I do codeposition[Node]code, I can access codeposition[Node.data]code.p  pstrongWhy this is not a duplicatestrong The linked question is a broad operator overloading post, it just mentions 1 point where it states that code[]operatorcode can only be overloaded with member functions and not otherwise, does not state why And this is a specific problem I am facing where I do not want to sacrifice the generic property of my self made Heap, and use it for the Dijkstra as well.p  pstrongEDIT2strong  While writing this explanation I realize I had made a big mistake in my overloaded function.

Negative 45272 pIm trying to set up some streams and taps in Spring XD 1.2.1 using Kafka as the message bus and encountering some issues.p  pFor testing purposes I have set up a Spring XD cluster with and Admin Node and two Container Nodes although in production we would probably want at least 3 Container Nodes.p  pIdeally also we want all modules deployed to all containers for load balancing and failover purposes, although since module..count0 does not work on with the Kafka message bus Im doing this manually by defining module count 2 for each module.p  pThe streams we want to create will send data through from a source to a sink and additionally send it to several counters.p  pFor testing Im using a http  file stream.p  pFirstly I created p  precodestream create httpfiletest definition http  file  codepre  pand deployed with p  precodemodule.http.count2,module.file.count2 codepre  pThis creates both modules on each container and when I pass a message through it correctly sends the message to only one of the file outputs on one of the container machines.p  pI then created p  precodestream create name httpfiletesttap definition tapstreamhttpfiletest1 gt transform  counter namehttpfiletestcount codepre  pWhen I deploy this without deployment properties it creates single transform and counter modules as expected and correctly counts the messages flowing through.p  pHowever if I deploy this with p  precodemodule.transform.count2,module.counter.count2  codepre  pie 2 transform and 2 counter modules, one on each node each message gets counted twice.p  pIs this a bug It looks like a hrefhttpsjira.spring.iobrowseXD3100 relnofollowhttpsjira.spring.iobrowseXD3100a although I think this was raised with Rabbit as the message bus and its closed  is it possible this is still happening with Kafka as the message busp  pOn Kafka the flowing topics are createdp  precode                                        Partitions  Brokers httpfiletest.0                              2       2 httpfiletesttap.0                           2       2 SpringXdOffsets                             1       1 tap3Astream3Ahttpfiletest.http.0          1       1 tap3Astream3Ahttpfiletesttap.transform.0  1       1 codepre  pIs the difference in partitions relevant herep  pAs an alternative to using taps, I tried using a named channel iep  precodestream create httptotopic definition http gt topicmytopic stream create topictofile definition topicmytopic gt file stream create topictocounter1 definition topicmytopic gt counter namecounter1 stream create topictocounter2 definition topicmytopic gt counter namecounter2 codepre  pAnd again deployed everything with a module count of 2. This not only gives duplicate messages in the counters but also in the file output ie I get a message in the output file on each container. Interestingly this seems to behave exactly the same if I use queuemyqueue.p  pIn these scenarios XD does just seem to create one topic in Kafka which looks like what I want.p  pWhat is the expected behaviour here Ideally what I want is to be able to place a message on a named channel and each distinct consumer ie file, counter 1 and counter 2 to pick up that message once even if there are multiple instances of them on different nodes.  Is this possible Should it be a queue or a topicp  pAlso it would be useful to have a bit more documentation on how streams, taps and named channels get mapped into queuestopics on Rabbit and Kafka. We are trying to design the streams to limit the amount of queues  topics created in the message bus, so it looks like the second approach a topic instead of a tap would be better in that regard.p

Negative 45272 pIm attempting to use a hrefhttpscode.google.comppgprovider relnofollow titlepgProviderpgProvidera as part of a move to Postgresql to get membership working in a .NET MVC4 web app, however I keep encountering the following errorp  precodeERROR 42P01 relation versions does not exist codepre  pSo far Ive set up the web.config as suggested and confirmed that the provider is successfully connecting to the database using .NET Reflector. Ive narrowed the issue down to the codeValidateVersioncode function within the a hrefhttpscode.google.comppgprovidersourcebrowsetrunkpgProviderDDLManager.cs relnofollowDDLManager.csa file in pgProvider.p  pEssentially what is happening is pgProvider is trying to check if it should autocreate the membership tables by checking if the tables already exist. However the way in which it does this is by running this queryp  precodeselect count from pgtables where schemaname  public and tablename  versions codepre  pAnd then tries to parse the result into an int, returning the bool from codeint.TryParsecode as the indicator of whether the table exists or not. But because the result that is being returned is 0 instead of NULL which I assume is what pgProvider expects if there is no table, it always evaluates to true...because obviously 0 is an int.

Negative 45272 pIm trying to learn Django and I would like feedback from anyone who has any MVCMTVPHPRuby framework experience. Does anyone find that the user model is too tightly coupled with authp  pBackground When you first implement authentication for Django, you include the module django.contrib.auth p  pThis will bring in several models like User, Group, Message etc. Lets focus on the User model as this is the one of the most important tables in any website.p  pIn short the User table has these fieldsp  pUserp  ul liusername maxlength 30, unique, [letters, digits, underscores]li lipassword maxlength 75li liemail maxlength 75li li...and about 8 other useful fields like firstname, lastname, etc.li ul  pstrongGoalstrongp  pI want to remove username and use email as the login for every user. Its a pretty simple request that many websites use these days.p  pI dont want to monkey patch the core code since this will make upgrading more difficult later on. This means modifying the User model is out of the question. I only want to do a few simple and basic things I expect a few frameworks to do so let me address how Django does it.p  pstrongAdding new fields to the User modelstrongp  pDjango docs says to use create another table and insert the fields there. You will have a one to one relationship between the User table and the Profile table.  eg. If You want to add an image field to each user you add it to the profile table. A join query is made every single time. Theyve even specified a constant to tell the framework what table to use AUTHPROFILEMODULE  accounts.UserProfile I dont think its the best practice to have to do a join query every time I want a field that should belong to the user table.p  pAnother option is to use the function addtoclass.  The django community has stated its not good to define new fields outside of the main class because other developers who add methods wont know all the data members. p  pstrongEditing old fieldsstrongp  pThe auth module does a check against two fields username and the hashed password. Looking at the above table I would need to change the username model to accept these properties. Length of 75 with all the valid characters of the email. The django suggests I check against the email field.p  pTwo problems arise if I use the email field to auth against I need to write a new class to be used in a constant AUTHENTICATIONBACKEND, so it checks against the email field and I have an unused field called username.p  pstrongAdding new methodsstrongp  pIn MVCMTV a design principle is to use fat models skinny controllers. Since the model is declared in auth, Im not sure how  one is supposed to add methods that act on the user models fields. Since django suggests using a Profile model, I suppose they will have to go there.p  pstrongExtending the User classstrongp  pA small annoyance would be that I cant use the name User and instead must use Users or Accounts. A bigger one is I dont think the auth would recognize this new module. Meaning I would have to rewrite a bunch functionality that is is present. This one doesnt bother me as its something I expect to do in other frameworks.p  pAny comments are appreciated. I wouldnt ask all these questions and look for solutions if I wasnt truly interested in using django.p

Negative 45272 pIve been trying to parallelize this piece of code for about two days and keep having logical errors.

What should i do to make my variables which hold values of text and image visible in the third set of files In C there is EXTERN key word for such things if im not mistaken.

Negative 45272 pa hrefhttpstackoverflow.comq10282857567863Thisa StackOverflow question gave me food for thought on what is a good structure for Rails i18n files, so I thought Id share another structure for refactoring Rails i18n yml files for your considerationcriticism.  p  pGiven that I would like top  ol likeep the default app structure so I can use shorthand lazy lookups like codet.sometranslationcode in my views, as well as have an idea where translations are used in the app,li liavoid as much string repetition as possible, in particular with words that are not just the same, but also have identical contextsmeanings,li lionly have to change a key once to have it reflected everywhere its referenced,li ol  pfor a strongconfiglocalesen.ymlstrong file that looks something like thisp  precodeactiverecord   attributes     user       email Email       name Name       password Password       passwordconfirmation Confirmation   models     user User users   fields     email Email     name Name     password Password     confirmation Confirmation sessions   new     email Email     password Password codepre  pI can see that there is significant repetition, and that the context of words like Email and Password are unambiguous and have the same meaning in their respective views.  It would be a bit annoying to have to go and change them all if I decide to change Email to email, so Id like to refactor the strings to reference a dictionary of some sort.  So, how about adding a dictionary hash to the top of the file with some codeampcode anchors like thisp  precodedictionary   email ampemail Email   name ampname Name   password amppassword Password   confirmation ampconfirmation Confirmation  activerecord   attributes     user       email email       name name       password password       passwordconfirmation confirmation   models     user User users   fields       email email     name name     password password     confirmation confirmation sessions   new     email email     password password codepre  pYou could still continue to use static strings eg User above, but whenever you get more than one instance of exactly the same wordphrase in your views, you could refactor it out to the dictionary.  If the dictionary translation of a key in the base language doesnt make sense for a target language, then just change out the referenced value in the target language to a static string or add it as an extra entry to the target languages dictionary.  Im sure each languages dictionary could be refactored out into another file if they get too big and unwieldy as long as it then gets reimported at the top of the translation file so the references work.p  pThis way of structuring i18n yaml files seems to work well with some local test apps I tried it on.  Im hoping the wonderful a hrefhttpwww.localeapp.comLocaleappa will provide support for this kind of anchoringreferencing in the future.  But anyway, all this dictionary talk cant possibly be an original idea, so are there other issues with anchor referencing in YAML, or maybe just with the whole dictionary concept in general  Or is it just better to just rip out the default backend entirely and replace it with a hrefhttpredis.ioRedisa or something if you have needs beyond Rails default i18n conventionsp  pstrongEditstrongp  pI wanted to try and address tigrishs workflow example mentioned in a comment below up here, rather than as another comment below his answer.

Negative 45272 pAfter upgrading from Boost 1.47.0 to 1.50.0 our build times exploded for the debug builds. They now take approx. 3 times longer while the release builds are somewhat slower but not a lot. We use VS2010 in combination with Teamcity for building. p  pAnybody have a clue where this is coming from From what I see in the build logs every project that uses Boost is building a lot slower, it doesnt seem related to a specific part of Boost. We do precompile the Boost headers.p  pI had to increase the memory available for precompiling in some projects using the Zm compiler option so that indicates at least that more memory is needed than before. Our build agents seem to have enough memory though. I did notice that the compiler cl.exe doesnt use a lot of CPU time 510 which may indicate slowness getting the header files from the network but I dont see why this has changed a lot when upgrading Boost versions.p  pAny help is really appreciated.p

Negative 45272 pIm working on an app and Ive recently added in a sidebar and I want it to act like Facebooks. They have a search bar anchored at the top, as a custom header Im sure since the other section headers replace it as you scroll, but the header doesnt allow bouncing. The thing that I cant figure out how to do is allow for bouncing on the cells within the tableview. Setting tableview.bounces  NO locks everything in place, but doesnt allow for the cells to bounce like I want them to. p  pIn summary, I have a sidebar that slides over. I have one section, with a custom header. I want that header anchoredlocked to the position it is initialized in no bouncing above the header. Then I want the cells within the tableview to be able to bounce at the top and bottom of the view. p  pThanks for any help or input.p

How is this possible Why dont I get the expected imaxlogimax dependence I have limited experience with C, please help Thanksp  pstrongUpdatestrong thank you Xeo, Rick and everyone who responded. As Xeo and Rick explained, the problem is that the comparator in my case codestruct acode with the map containing values gets copied on each comparison, hence the computational complexity codeOimax2 logimaxcode. One way around this that I can see so that changes to my code are minimal is to use a pointer to the map, namely codemaplta,floatgt valscode, instead of codemaplta,floatgt valscode. Then the map copying is avoided, and the complexity is back to codeOimax logimaxcode. Thanks a lot p

Negative 45272 pI literally started learning MASM32 yesterday so bear with me if this is a dumb question.p  pMy understanding of codeaddrcode and codeoffsetcode is as follows both return the memory address of a variable but codeoffsetcode only works on global variables whose memory addresses are know at assemble time and codeaddrcode will work on both global and local variables.

Is it something to do with regular expressions which Im not very familiar with other then the fact that it is a custom pattern used to match parts of a string. p  pThe book explanation was as followsp  pThe delimiter and normalize members are all for the normalization of regular expression strings, so that the remaining methods can operate on them without first having to check or normalize them. The match and split methods perform similarly to the pregmatchall and pregsplit functions, but require less formal structure to the regular expressions, and return a more predictable set of results. The match method will return the first captured substring, the entire substring match, or null. The split method will return the results of a call to the pregsplit function, after setting some flags and normalizing the regular expression.p  pThanks for the help in advance.p

I also know codeAVFoundationcode has great support for handling tracks. What I dont know, is if these are compatible to each other Can AVFoundation handle separate tracks from within one single file And are there any codecs with support for such tracking for iOSe.g .mp4, .mov, ... p  pI imagine problems would occur if a standard video player tried to watch this resulting moviefile possibly only playing the video with the first audio track, but Im thinking since I can already assume there are two or more audio tracks, it could be done Is this possible in any wayp

Negative 45272 pI am trying to serialise and store objectsdata in a database efficiently. The object can take any form but in most cases it will be of a class that has a primitive counterpart such as codeIntegercode. I have written the following methods to marshal and unmarshalp  precodeprivate String marshallObject obj throws IOException      if obj instanceof String          return String obj      else if obj instanceof Integer  obj instanceof Byte  obj instanceof Short  obj instanceof Long  obj instanceof Float  obj instanceof Double  obj instanceof Boolean  obj instanceof Character          return obj.toString      else          ByteArrayOutputStream baos  new ByteArrayOutputStream         try ObjectOutputStream oos  new ObjectOutputStreambaos              oos.writeObjectobj                  return new StringBase64Coder.encodebaos.toByteArray        private Object unmarshallString str, Class type throws IOException, ClassNotFoundException      if type.equalsInteger.class          return Integer.parseIntstr      else if type.equalsString.class          return str      else if type.equalsByte.class          return Byte.parseBytestr      else if type.equalsShort.class          return Short.parseShortstr      else if type.equalsLong.class          return Long.parseLongstr      else if type.equalsFloat.class          return Float.parseFloatstr      else if type.equalsDouble.class          return Double.parseDoublestr      else if type.equalsBoolean.class          return Boolean.parseBooleanstr      else if type.equalsCharacter.class          return str.toCharArray[0]      else          byte[] data  Base64Coder.decodestr         Object o         try ObjectInputStream ois  new ObjectInputStream                 new ByteArrayInputStreamdata              o  ois.readObject                  return o       codepre  pThese methods work fine or at least my JUnit test seems to think they do but I am just wondering what the best way to store the outputted values would be. The two options I see are LONGTEXT or BLOB. I can see some advantages for both. From what I have researched both will have a maximum length of 4GB  1B. BLOBS are not searchable but store the data passed to them byte for byte which may or may not be advantageous  I am not sure. LONGTEXT is searchable and if I can change the encoding from UTF8 to something closer to BASE64 if you know what encoding would be best, let me know then it might be more space efficient than the BLOB encoding which at the moment is encoded as UTF8 and reversible via codeCONVERTvalue USING utf8code.p  pAnother option I saw was storing both by having a coderawValuecode which just uses the code.toStringcode method on whatever is being stored and codevaluecode which is a BLOB or even LONGTEXT if appropriate. This would provide searchable data in the coderawValuecode and an object representation in the codevaluecode. I am not sure if this would be something beneficial to do in the long run, but it would make it easier for thirdparties to access the database and to read the data from other languages such as PHP.p  pI am willing to take on suggestions for completely different approaches if you feel you have something better for this scenario.p

Negative 45272 pIve got an ASP.NET website that I deployed to Azure. Im using VS2013, .NET 4.5.1 and Azure SDK 2.2. I turned on remote debugging for VS2013 in the management portal. I can successfully right click the website under the Azure node in servers, and select Attach debugger. It says that it is downloading debugging settings, and then the web browser comes up. But breakpoints are never hit despite them being in code that I know is executed. One clue the breakpoint has an open circle and states The breakpoint will not currently be hit. No symbols have been loaded for this document. But the breakpoint works fine when testing locally. Does anyone have any thoughts on how to address thisp  pThanks...p  pBenp  pUpdate I dropped from .NET 4.5.1 to 4.5 problem persists.p
Negative 45272 pApologies if a similar question has been addressed elsewhere but Im struggling to find the obvious answer to my issue....  I have rolled out a split end database .accdb created in Access 2013 to 6 members of my team by providing each with a copy of the front end which links to a back end on a shared network drive. Four of the users are opening the db through Access 2013, one through Access Runtime 2013 and one through Runtime 2010 32 bit.p  pThe primary job of the database is to allow users to allocate and manage tasks for a set of campaigns. The db centres around a task table which is updated via a bound form. When new task records are created, usually via a control from a parent campaign form, some fields are prepopulated. p  pThe frequent bug seems to occur when a two users are editing different task records via the task form at the same time. Occasionally, one of the task records becomes corrupted hashed out or Chinese characters but more often one of the tasks becomes duplicated in place of the other. This then leads to duplicate task IDs and the loss of the primary key on this field. p  pI have tried setting record locking to both no locks optimistic locking  on users access clients except the Runtime versions where I cant see there is an option to do this and on the task form itself  and edit record pessimistic locking using the setting in the task form properties. p  pI am having trouble diagnosing whether the error lies with locking andor the point at which a record is saved currently just on form close or whether there is a bigger weakness in the set up. Does anyone have any ideas as to why this duplication and sometimes corruption might occur Thanksp

Negative 45272 pI have been collecting tweets from the past week to collect the past7days tweets related to lung cancer, yesterday, I figured I needed to start collecting more fields, so I added some fields and started recollecting the same period of Tweets related to lung cancer from last week. The problem is, the first time Ive collected 2000 tweets related to lung cancer on 18th, Sept 2014. But last night, it only gave 300 tweets, when I looked at the time of the tweets for this new set, its only collecting tweets from something like 2329 to 2359 on 18th Sept 2014. A large chunk of data is obviously missing. I dont think its something with my code below, I have tested various ways including deleting most of the fields to be collected and the time of data is still cut off prematurely.p  pIs this a known issue with Twitter API when collecting last 7 days data If so, it will be pretty horrible if someone is trying to do serious research.

Negative 45272 pI have a bat script which is rather complex and runs every 15 minutes. It opens a browser, runs an iMacro to sign in and download a file, closes the browser, extracts the file, initiates a javascript which verifies that the downloaded file is more recent than the one downloaded 15 minutes earlier, opens Excel, imports the downloaded file, triggers a very involved VB Script, exports a csv file, closes Excel, opens a new browser, logs in to a 2nd site, uploads the csv file and closes the browser again.p  pMeanwhile Im doing my job, which requires many browser tabs open in several different browsers, and web development software.p  pWhile the script is running, my computer will frequently come to a near standstill, preventing me from doing any other work  presumedly because the CPU usage is maxed out. Not only can I not do other work, but my script frequently fails to complete because the browser is so slow it times out before the page loads.p  pTask Manager tells me that my CPU usage while running the script is 98100 and Im using 7 out of 8 MB of RAM. Obviously, Im pushing my computer to its limits. Is there anything I can do to help minimize the slow down, such as allocate some RAM, partition my hard drive, make a sacrifice to the processor gods, etc. My computer is a 64bit running Windows 7 Pro with 8MB of RAM and a 3.00 GHz processor.  I cant get a new computer but I can probably ask for additional RAM if it would help.p  pI dont know very much about performance optimization, so any suggestions are welcome. I cant stop using the script, run it less often, or run it on a different computer.p

Negative 45272 pI need to format datetime in a gridview to just show the date. I cant just change the format fo the indiviidual column during the extraction from sql because the code uses the .net generated SqlDataAdapter.Fill. I read on other stackoverflow questions for how to change the date format in bound fields and yet other answers call for using somehting like gridview. Format which intellisense is not finding and is unsurprisingly giving me a nodefinition compile error if I try to just type and use it. I cant simply change teh property in the aaspx becuase it is a programatically generated gridview. p  pIs there a way to enumerate across the columns in the gridview and check if a column is already a datetime type they will be coming in as datetime from sql, the sort is already working properly so they are not coming in as strings and change the format on those to just date currently when I try to enumerate across the columns it skips because the count of columns in the gridview during the data bound is still coming out as 0. Or does anyone have an idea that would be less expensive, these are thousands of rows coming in so it may be much better if I can just format the column or entire gridview for datetime information. thank youp  pEDIT I found a way by putting this in the gridviewRowDataBoundp  precode                foreach DataControlFieldCell cell in e.Row.Cells                                      AutoGeneratedField field  cell.ContainingField as AutoGeneratedField                     if field  null ampamp field.DataType  typeofDateTime                         cell.Text  DateTime.Parsecell.Text.ToShortDateString                  codepre

Negative 45272 pI have a sidebar menu that expands on hover. Works really really great, but Id like to make it to where when it expands IF it touches another element it will push it over. I say this because my content will be centered so it comes down to the users resolution for this to happen. On my page I have one other element besides my menu and it is an errori triggered this error on purpose for testing. The error element should be 100 width. Again this is here for testing purposes. Right now the sidebar is overlapping the error element even when not expanded.

Negative 45272 pAccording to apples document a hrefhttpsdeveloper.apple.comlibrarymacdocumentationCocoaConceptualCocoaViewsGuideSubclassingNSViewSubclassingNSView.html relnofollowCreating a Custom Viewa this method should be called if youre using a custom view proxy in the Interface Builder. p  pemIf you have not created an Interface Builder palette for your custom view, there are two techniques you can use to create instances of your subclass within Interface Builder. The first is using the Custom View proxy item in the Interface Builder containers palette. This view is a standin for your custom view, allowing you to position and size the view relative to other views. You then specify the subclass of NSView that the view represents using the inspector. When the nib file is loaded by the application, the custom view proxy creates a new instance of the specified view subclass and initializes it using the initWithFrame method, passing along any autoresizing flags as necessary. The view instance then receives an awakeFromNib message.em p  pUnfortunately, Its not been called in my case. Has anybody had to deal with this issuep

Negative 45272 pIf my Cassandra codeDELETEcode operations always use a consistency level of codeALLcode, is it safe to reduce the codegcgracesecondscode property to a low value It seems to me that the codeALLcode consistency level means that repairs of deletion operations are never necessary, so the safety provided by the GC grace period is unnecessary. Or are there corner cases that mean the GC grace period is still usefulp
