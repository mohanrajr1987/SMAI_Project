Negative 23087 pI am using a Datagrid with several columns of data call it myDG and one of these columns is a DateTime bound to a datasource.

Negative 23087 pI have a Graph being drawn inside a codeUIScrollViewcode.  Its one large codeUIViewcode using a custom subclass of codeCATiledLayercode as its layer.p  pWhen I zoom in and out of the codeUIScrollViewcode, I want the graph to resize dynamically like it does when I return the graph from codeviewForZoomingInScrollViewcode.  However, the Graph redraws itself at the new zoom level, and I want to reset the transform scale to 1x1 so that the next time the user zooms, the transform starts from the current view.  If I reset the transform to Identity in codescrollViewDidEndZoomingcode, it works in the simulator, but throws an codeEXCBADACCSEScode on the device.p  pThis doesnt even solve the issue entirely on the simulator either, because the next time the user zooms, the transform resets itself to whatever zoom level it was at, and so it looks like, if I was zoomed to 2x, for example, its suddenly at 4x.  When I finish the zoom, it ends up at the correct scale, but the actual act of zooming looks bad.p  pSo first how do I allow the graph to redraw itself at the standard scale of 1x1 after zooming, and how do I have a smooth zoom throughoutp  pbEditb New findings The error seems to be code[CALayer retainCount] message sent to deallocated instancecodep  pIm never deallocating any layers myself.  Before, I wasnt even deleting any views or anything.  This error was being thrown on zoom and also on rotate.  If I delete the object before rotation and readd it afterward, it doesnt throw the exception.  This is not an option for zooming.p

But would I get the performance characteristics of a hash table, or would the the interface add overheads that would reduce the performancep

Negative 23087 pIve an eventdriven app that has recently started using SQL Express 2008 instead of Std version in dev and test to store the current state of a state machine. After moving to SQL Express, we started seeing a discrepancy between the order in which we write to the database using LINQ to SQL and the order in which a hrefhttpsqlprofiler.googlepages.com relnofollowSQL Express Profilera reports the data going into the database.p  pWe log the data using Log4Net, and the log entries show the incoming events occur in the correct order and we emmustem have processed them in the correct order. Weve also found when profiling SQL express, that the data is being written emout of orderem. The effect is that when subsequent events come in about 500ms after calling codeSubmitChangescode on the LINQ data context, the DB writes have not yet been committed, so the state models think we are in an invalid state, and dont transition properly. The end result is chaos.p  pFor what its worth, I dont see this in SQL Server 2008 Standard, so Im wondering if this is a problem with SQL express Have you seen similar problems to thisp  pIm assuming that its not a problem with the profiler, since we do actually have a transition problem with some state transitions, so the profiler does seem to agree with observed results.p  pRegards,p  pAndrew Matthewsp

In cases where the server is not responding, the codeHttpWebRequest.GetResponsecode is taking about 20 seconds to time out, even though I have specified a timeout of only 5 seconds. In the interest of getting through the servers on a regular interval, I want to skip those taking longer than 5 seconds to connect to.p  pSo the question is emIs there a simple way to specifydecrease a connection timeout for a WebRequest or HttpWebRequestemp

Encrypted files must  be decrypted before they can be extracted.   Each encrypted file has an extra 12 bytes stored at the start of  the data area defining the encryption header for that file. The  encryption header is originally set to random values, and then  itself encrypted, using three, 32bit keys. The key values are  initialized using the supplied encryption password. After each byte  is encrypted, the keys are then updated using pseudorandom number  generation techniques in combination with the same CRC32 algorithm  used in PKZIP and described elsewhere in this document.   The following is the basic steps required to decrypt a file   1 Initialize the three 32bit keys with the password.  2 Read and decrypt the 12byte encryption header, further  initializing the encryption keys.  3 Read and decrypt the compressed data stream using the  encryption keys.

Read the 12byte encryption header into Buffer, in locations  Buffer0 thru Buffer11.   loop for i lt 0 to 11  C lt bufferi  decryptbyte  updatekeysC  bufferi lt C  end loop   Where decryptbyte is defined as   unsigned char decryptbyte  local unsigned short temp  temp lt Key2  2  decryptbyte lt temp  temp  1 gtgt 8  end decryptbyte   After the header is decrypted, the last 1 or 2 bytes in Buffer  should be the highorder wordbyte of the CRC for the file being  decrypted, stored in Intel lowbytehighbyte order. Versions of  PKZIP prior to 2.0 used a 2 byte CRC check a 1 byte CRC check is  used on versions after 2.0.

Negative 23087 pIm new to Python, with a background in statically typed languages including lots and lots of Java.p  pI decided on PyDev in eclipse as an IDE after checking featurespopularity etc.p  pI was stunned that autocomplete doesnt seem to work properly for builtins. For example if I try automcomplete on datafile afterp  pdatafile  opendirectoryaccount, r datafile.p  pNo useful methods are suggested e.g. realines.

My PyDev interpreter is set up fine with forced builtins.p  pIs it possible to get autocomplete for builtins with PyDev Am I approaching the IDE wrong, i.e. should have an interpreter running on the side and test stuff with it So far the IDEs have seemed weak, e.g. IDLE segfaulted on my new mac after 2 minutes.

I want to find the angle in radians between the center of the earth and these two LatLon objects. p  pIm going to use this angle and the radius of the earth to calculate the arc length between the two locations I figure this will give better precision than using simple Pythagoras, and be faster than computing the great circle distance.p  pI already have code to give me the Pythagorean distance and the great circle distance.p

Negative 23087 pIm working on a core data application that has a rather large hierarchy of managed objects similar to a tree.p  pWhen a base object is created, it creates a few child objects which in turn create their own child objects and so on. Each of these child objects may gather information using NSURLConnections.p  pNow, Id like to support undoredo with the undoManager in the managedObjectContext. The problem is, if a user creates a base object, then tries to undo that action, the base object is not removed. Instead, one or more of the child objects may be removed. Obviously this type of action is unpredictable and unwanted.p  pSo I tried disabling undo registration by default. I did this by calling codedisableUndoRegistrationcode before anything is modified in the managedObjectContext. Then, enabling undo registration before base operations such as creating a base object the again redisabling registrations afterwords.p  pNow when i try to undo, I get this error p  blockquote   pundo NSUndoManager 0x1026428b0 is in   invalid state, undo was called with   too many nested undo groupsp blockquote  pThoughtsp
Negative 23087 pIm writing an app that dynamically loads buttons and then, based on the changes in app settings, previous buttons will be unloaded and new ones will be loaded.

For example, Nil is a case object in the scala library.p  pHowever, both TreeMap and TreeSet create a new instance upon each empty call. After playing around with this for a while, its clear that the problem is the fact that orderings are not covariant. Is there a workaround for thisp

Negative 23087 pI have a Mac OS X application that is also a protocol handler just as, for example, Safari is a protocol handler for the HTTP and HTTPS protocols. So when a user clicks a link of the form myschemesomekindofinfo in any application at all, my application launches to handle the link.p  pNow I need to be able to determine if the application was launched by such a link click, or if it was launched by any other method. In other words, it was launched by any method besides a link click. In those cases, I want the app to stay open, but if it was launched by a link it should quit and ignore the link. This way it only operates when already running.p  pIs there some way within the app at startup to introspect and find out that it was launched by a standard method rather than by an AppleScript GetURL event Id like to find out through a documented method, rather than  for example  just have my app only open these links after its been running for a half a second.p

Negative 23087 pIm trying to determine which is the right way to code a DAO for a class that contains a few primitive data types, and three strongly typed objects which have DAOs of their own.p  pHeres the class Im implementing the DAO for, minus the getterssettersp  precodepublic class Course      private int id     private int number     private String title     private Subject subject     private School school     private Instructor instructor     ...  codepre  pThe Subject, School, and Instructor classes all have DAOs of their own. So my initial thought was to use those DAOs to instantiate the Subject, School, and Instructor objects in the Course object relevant code is in the try blockp  precodepublic class CourseDAO      public static Course selectCourseint id              ConnectionPool cp  ConnectionPool.getInstance         Connection c  cp.getConnection         PreparedStatement ps  null         ResultSet rs  null          Course course  null          String query  select id, number, title, subjectId, schoolId, instructorId                   from course                   where id                     limit 1          try                      ps  c.prepareStatementquery             ps.setInt1, id             rs  ps.executeQuery             if rs.next                              course  new Course                 course.setIdrs.getInt1                 course.setNumberrs.getInt2                 course.setTitlers.getString3                 course.setSubjectSubjectDAO.selectSubjectrs.getInt4                 course.setSchoolSchoolDAO.selectSchoolrs.getInt5                 course.setInstructorInstructorDAO.selectInstructorrs.getInt6                               catch SQLException e                      e.printStackTrace                  finally                      DBUtil.closeResultSetrs             DBUtil.closePreparedStatementps             cp.releaseConnectionc                   return course       codepre  pThe other DAOs look very similar to this one.

Negative 23087 pI realize this question is not completely cut and dry, but in general how do you know when an object has too many types p  pIm currently supporting a project in which I am unfamiliar with the baseline but am tasked to basically do bug fixes in a push to work down the number of items in our SPR database.   I keep coming across classes that extend many different interfaces, including one such class which extends a total of twelve. Many others extend 7 or 8.p  pNow I know its good design practice to depend on interfaces rather than concrete implementations, but is this going too far  Is this an actual code smell and potentially a sign of bad design, or am I just overreacting and depending on circumstance, it can be normal for a class to extend seven, eight, and even twelve different interfaces  It is tiring grepping through the baseline trying to track down the actual concrete types of an object that implements twelve interfaces.p

Negative 23087 pI need to do some calculations when one of my Components a Canvas gets resized.

Given the circumstances surrounding the situation, not all of which are strictly technical in nature, a tool to manually change the timestamp is not acceptable, nor is a modified version of codearcode, nor is messing with the actual system time.p  pEdit In this circumstance, I have to prove that, without any unacceptable deviation from the build path, the binaries can be produced from source.  In some industries e.g. finance this is apparently a standard practice.  A handrolled tool to change the timestamps is unacceptable because a special tool, which was not in the original build path, was used.  A handrolled version of codearcode is unacceptable similar problem.  The problem with changing system clock is that the build would have to be perfectly coordinated it is an hourlong build with a lot of libraries and binaries.  Acceptable solutions includep  ul liflags to AR or other programs that could override the timestamp in the libraryli lian existing age  1 year tool to do thisli liflags to GCC that could override the timestamp coming from ar when doing the linkingli ul

Negative 23087 pIve a collection of a usertype News currently stored in a NSArray. I have to store them in UserDefaults to save them on the Device. A News have a property ID which is unique. Before storing them to UserDefaults, I convert the NSArray to a NSDictionary where the key is the ID and the object for this key is the News. Is this a good way to store themp  pThe reason for choosing an NSDictionary is to be able to check if a News with a specific ID exists in the list of News each time I redownload the News from a Web Service. This way I have only one News instance for each News ID. I think this would be hard to manage using a normal NSArray  or Im missing somethingp

I want my user to upload their SCSS files to my server and then compile it into normal CSS at the server, once compiled, the file will be sent to the user again for the download. It would seem user seamless as they just uploaded and then downloaded the file. But behind the scene compilation is occurred. I can do that this way...p  ol liUser uploads file send POST requestli liI process the request by getting file, reading contents, writing to scss file.li liI connected to server terminal using SSH and compiled this file using strongcompass compilestrong and then send compiled file back to the user as request POST response.li ol  pThere would be huge SSH connections and my server would be exhausted.

Negative 23087 pThere is an Arduino library called ByteBuffer found a hrefhttpsiggiorn.comp460 relnofollowherea, which is a circular buffer implementation. I modified it slightly calling it ByteBufferPro, by chopping off support for all nonbyte datatypes, and adding few convenience methods. I intend to use this in my InterruptServiceRoutine, that is already doing some heavylifting. To relieve some bit of workload on the ISR, I intend to let the ISR push bytes of information on the circularbuffer since capturingstoring them is timecritical, but actual processing of that information is not as timecritical, which I do in the main loop.p  pFollowing the logic that any variable that can be updated in ISR should have the volatile qualifier in declaration, I did declare the buffer as volatile, but now I am seeing these compilation errorsp  precodeByteBufferProExample.cpp In function void setup ByteBufferProExample12 error passing volatile ByteBufferPro as this argument of void ByteBufferProinitunsigned int discards qualifiers ByteBufferProExample.cpp In function void loop ByteBufferProExample24 error passing volatile ByteBufferPro as this argument of void ByteBufferProclear discards qualifiers codepre  pWondering as to what is the reason, and how I might fix this  Taking the cribbage being about this pointer, I have a feeling that if I turn the implementation of ByteBuffer from C to a C one OO to procedural, that should be an easy way to fix it, although I really like the OO semantics. Would do so, if there is no other way.p

Ive replaced the myfacesapi.jar and myfacesimpl.jar with the corresponding jsfapi.jar and jsfimpl.jar, and took out from web.xml as many MyFaces parameters and filters as possible some needed to remain because I still use Tomahawk. I have also upgraded Tomahawk to 1.1.11 for JSF2.p  pThe applications JSCookMenu renders just fine, but doesnt trigger any action when clicking the menu items. I have some tnavigationMenuItem whose action attribute is bound to an outcome in facesconfig.xml which should load a new view id, and yet some tnavigationMenuItem whose actionListener attribute is bound to a bean method the Logout menu item, for example. Neither of them works, the actionListener code from my bean is not even called.p  pIm not even sure how to investigate this, did anybody have a clue as to how can this be solved Im hoping something in web.xml can be of help.p  pThe navigation cases are written correctly in the facesconfig.xml, they used to work on JSF 1.2MyFaces and also on JSF 2MyFaces prior to the migration to Mojarra.p  pThis is the relevant part of my web.xml filep  precodeltservletgt     ltservletnamegtfacesltservletnamegt     ltservletclassgtjavax.faces.webapp.FacesServletltservletclassgt     ltloadonstartupgt1ltloadonstartupgt ltservletgt ltservletmappinggt     ltservletnamegtfacesltservletnamegt     lturlpatterngt.xhtmllturlpatterngt ltservletmappinggt ltcontextparamgt     ltparamnamegtcom.sun.faces.allowTextChildrenltparamnamegt     ltparamvaluegttrueltparamvaluegt ltcontextparamgt ltcontextparamgt     ltparamnamegtjavax.faces.FACELETSRESOURCERESOLVERltparamnamegt     ltparamvaluegtcom.avalanche.jsf.MyResourceResolverltparamvaluegt ltcontextparamgt ltcontextparamgt     ltparamnamegtjavax.faces.STATESAVINGMETHODltparamnamegt     ltparamvaluegtclientltparamvaluegt ltcontextparamgt ltcontextparamgt     ltparamnamegtorg.apache.myfaces.AUTOSCROLLltparamnamegt     ltparamvaluegttrueltparamvaluegt ltcontextparamgt ltcontextparamgt     ltparamnamegtfacelets.DEVELOPMENTltparamnamegt     ltparamvaluegttrueltparamvaluegt ltcontextparamgt ltcontextparamgt     ltparamnamegtfacelets.RECREATEVALUEEXPRESSIONONBUILDBEFORERESTOREltparamnamegt     ltparamvaluegtfalseltparamvaluegt ltcontextparamgt  ltfiltergt     ltfilternamegtfacesExtensionsFilterltfilternamegt     ltfilterclassgtorg.apache.myfaces.webapp.filter.ExtensionsFilterltfilterclassgt     ltinitparamgt         ltparamnamegtuploadMaxFileSizeltparamnamegt         ltparamvaluegt1gltparamvaluegt     ltinitparamgt ltfiltergt ltfiltermappinggt     ltfilternamegtfacesExtensionsFilterltfilternamegt     ltservletnamegtfacesltservletnamegt ltfiltermappinggt ltfiltermappinggt     ltfilternamegtfacesExtensionsFilterltfilternamegt     lturlpatterngtfacesmyFacesExtensionResourcelturlpatterngt ltfiltermappinggt codepre

Negative 23087 pI have a question on using MVVM within a Silverlight application I am developing. Whilst I understand the concept of MVVM, I am unsure how it would be best be applied within my application or even if MVVM would be suitable for my application.p  pMy application is a navigation application, which simply displays a series of live video streams to the user. The user can switch between streams etc. There is no backend data store for the application, stream details are simply passed to the Silverlight application by the hosting page in a JSON encoded string. p  pIs MVVM best suited to this type of application, or would it be more suited to a data centric applicationp  pI hope I have given enough information regarding the application, if however you need more information, I will be happy to edit this question.p  pMany Thanksp

Negative 23087 pIm having a hard time understanding how to implement a single model selfjoin in Rails.  The a hrefhttpguides.rubyonrails.orgassociationbasics.htmlGuide to ActiveRecord Associations section 2.10a briefly explains SelfJoins but doesnt offer enough information, and every example or post about this such references the Friendly Friend Railcast example that isnt a single model self join, as described in the a hrefhttpguides.rubyonrails.orgassociationbasics.htmlRails Guide section 2.10a.p  pThe idea is a model that hasmany and belongsto itself, without needing a separate table for the relationship. The only reason I see for needing a separate table is if you want the relationship to contain more information than just the relationship. e.g. best friends, barely know themp  pI have a simple Post schemap  precodecreatetable posts, force gt true do t     t.datetime posted     t.string   nick     t.string   title     t.text     content     t.integer  parentpostid     t.datetime createdat,     null gt false     t.datetime updatedat,     null gt false end codepre  pThe parentpostid is a selfreference to other Post postids. The posts.rb model has the relationship definedp  precodeclass Post lt ActiveRecordBase   hasmany replies, classname gt Post   belongsto parentpost, classname gt Post,     foreignkey gt parentpostid end codepre  pIn the Controller or View Im hoping to be able to do something like thisp  precodeposts.each do post   ...   replies  post.replies   replies.each do reply     ...   end end codepre  pOr find a posts parentp  precodeparentpost  post.parentpost codepre  pThis may all be some syntax misunderstanding. So thanks in advance to anyone who can slap some sense into me.

Negative 23087 pI want to send an HTML email with PHP.  I was wondering what headers should be used in the email to ensure it doesnt get blocked or end up in SPAM folders.p  pThe email contents will contain CSS and HTML.  The replyto field will be different than the senders  will this affect anything p  pstrongEDITstrong I dont know why my question was voted down.  Anyway, Im not looking to email SPAM or mailing lists.  The reason why I want the replyto field to be different than the sender is because Im creating a web app where a user manages jobs from various clients.  Whenever a job is updated or created, the app will automatically send an email regarding job updates to the client.  The client can then reply to the email to contact the user  thats why I need the replyto field to be the users email address.p

Negative 23087 pI have been trying to use TimeZoneInfo.GetSystemTimeZones in .net4 to replace our old method which uses COM to call into some MFC code. However, Ive had to revert to the COM method because GetSystemTimeZones doesnt return all time zones. Being based in the UK and not including GMT Standard Time in our list of options is a problem.p  pWhen I look in the registry, I find that emGMT Standard Timeem has a emDynamic DSTem subkey with no rules defined. I downloaded the .net4 source code and, in TimeZoneInfo.cs,  GetSystemTimeZones eventually calls TryCreateAdjustmentRules which appears to return false if the emDynamic DSTem key has no FirstEntry or LastEntry defined.p  precode                          loop over all of the lttimezonenamegtDynamic DST hive entries                             read FirstEntry  MinValue       year1, 12, 31              read MiddleEntry yearN, 1, 1  yearN, 12, 31               read LastEntry   yearN, 1, 1  MaxValue                      read the FirstEntry and LastEntry key values ex 1980, 2038             Int32 first  Int32dynamicKey.GetValuecfirstEntryValue, 1, RegistryValueOptions.None              Int32 last  Int32dynamicKey.GetValueclastEntryValue, 1, RegistryValueOptions.None              if first  1  last  1  first gt last                   rules  null                 return false               codepre  pAs TryCreateAdjustmentRules returns false, TryGetTimeZoneByRegistryKey throws an InvalidTimeZoneException which means emGMT Standard Timeem doesnt get added into the time zone collection. Ive tried deleting the empty emDynamic DSTem subkeys but something adds them back in again probably Windows Update.p  pIve done alot of searching but havent seen anyone else report this problem. Im not sure whether there is a GetSystemTimeZones fix or whether I can stop the empty emDynamic DSTem subkey appearing in the first place. Any ideasp

From searching on Google, Im definitely not the only person whos experienced this problem in general but none of the solutions I have found seem to be working. p  pMy problem is that the host application is not accepting requests that contain the codecode character and no matter what I try it wont pass off the request to my codeJsonpMediaTypeFormattercode. Because of that I have no idea if the formatter would or wouldnt fix the actual problem.p  pUsing fiddler, I can see that the request is being made with an codeAcceptscode header of codecode which I imagine isnt going through to my formatter and I cant add codecode to the codeMediaTypeHeaderValuecode because it complains that its a range. p  pPlease any help or suggestions would be appreciatedp  hr  h3Full Description of Setuph3  pI created a sandbox solution to test with that is composed of two ASP.NET web application projects.

Each such pair is arranged in exactly one cell of the single column by using a codeDockPanelcode for each pair.p  pThe Slider has a minimal width so that it does not collapse, the textbox does not, it is resized dynamically on receiving input.p  pThe problem is that when the textboxs width increases the column width is not equivalently changed. This causes the slider in the corresponding row to be visually clipped on the right side. As a result the sliders knob disappears in the void when moved to the right end. p  pSo the question is How do I force the column width of the gridview to resize dynamically if the contents exceed the available space which was set at initialization timep  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comUv1BZ.png altPercentage sliders with disappearing knobsp  pemJust ignore the label between the textbox and the slider without it the behaviour does not change.emp

Negative 23087 pi have a case where i create a class inside an outer function and then return that class. the class has a specified parent class. i would like that class variable to be accessible by class methods on the parent class, these methods are called at class initialization time. in summary, i need to be able to set a class variable not hardcoded so that it is available before initializing other, hardcoded class variables.p  pheres some sample code to make that clearerp  precodeclass Parentobject     classvar  None      classmethod     def getclassvartimestwocls         return cls.classvar  2   def outerfunctionclassvarvalue      class ChildParent         othervar  Parent.getclassvartimestwo  lt at this point, somehow Childs classvar is set to classvarvalue codepre  pNot sure if this is even possible in python. Maybe classvarvalue doesnt need to be passed through the outer function. I tried using metaclasses and forcing the variable through in the class attribute dictinoary, but couldnt figure out how to set classvar on Child early enough so that it was set prior to initializing othervar. If that was possible, then this would all work. Any thoughts are appreciatedp  pEdit also considered making othervar a lazy property, but that isnt an option for my use case.p
Negative 23087 pWhen should I save my models in rails and who should be responsible for calling save, the model itself, or the caller p  pLets say I have publicmethods like codeudpatepointscode, codeupdatelevelcode, etc. in my user model. There are 2 optionsp  ol liThe modelmethod is responsible for calling save . So each method will just call  codeself.savecode.li liThe caller is responsible for calling save. So each method only updates the attributes but the caller calls codeuser.savecode when its done with the user. li ol  pThe tradeoffs are fairly obvious  In option em1em the model is guaranteed to save, but we call save multiple times per transaction.  In option em2em we call save only once per transaction, but the caller has to make sure to call save. For example codeteam.leader.updatepointscode would require me to call codeteam.leader.savecode which is somewhat nonintuitive. This can get even more complicated if I have multiple methods operating on the same model object. p  pAdding a more specific info as per request  update level looks at how many points the users has and updates the level of the user. The function also make a call to the facebook api to notify it that the user has achieved an new level, so I might potently execute it as a background job. p

Negative 23087 pstrongBackgroundstrong You can skip this sectionp  pI have a large amount of data about 3 mb that needs to be kept up to date on several hundred machines.  Some of the machines run C and some run Java.  The data could change at any time and needs to be propogated to the clients within minutes.  The data is delivered in Json format from 4 load balanced servers.  These 4 servers are running ASP.NET 4.0 with Mvc 3 and C 4.0.p  pThe code that runs on the 4 servers has a hashing algorithm which hashes the Json response and then converts the hash to a string.  This hash is given to the client.  Then, every few minutes, the clients ping the server with the hash and if the hash is out of date the new Json object is returned.  If the hash is still current then a 304 with an emptry body is returned.p  pOccasionally the hashes generated by the 4 boxes are inconsistent across the boxes, which means that the clients are constantly downloading the data each request could hit a different server.p  pstrongCode Snipetstrongp  pHere is the code that is used to generate the hash.p  precodeinternal static HashAlgorithm Hasher  get set  ...

It is not converted.p  pstrongThe Problemstrongp  pI discovered that the Prehash and ASCIIBytes values were the same, but the HashedBytes values were different  which meant that the Hash was also different.p  pI restarted the IIS WebSites on the 4 server boxes several times and, when they had different hashes, compared the values in BeyondCompare.  In everycase it was the HashedBytes value that was different the results of SHA1Managed.ComputeHash...p  pstrongThe Questionstrongp  pWhat am I doing wrong  The input to the ComputeHash function is identical.

Negative 23087 pIm just starting to learn rubyp  pIm trying to get the first key and value key from a hash table in ruby. I dont know the key values of the hash because it is passed to the method.

Negative 23087 pThis has me perplexed. I have a textbox. You type something in, and press enter. Javascript creates a readonly input element in separate form. Along side the text input boxes are buttons to remove them. There is also a submit button at the bottom of that form to submit all of the readonly text inputs. p  pSince clicking a button inside of a form would submit the form and I just want to remove the parent div that contains both the button and its corresponding text input, a function is called when the form submits. This function determines which type of button remove or submit was pressed and acts accordingly.p  pHere comes the problem. When a remove button is pressed, the function codedestinations.entercode is never called. What I did to solve this was to create a global function called codesubmitDestinationscode that replicates the functionality of codedestinations.entercode. If this function is called instead, everything goes off without a hitch.p  pDoes anyone have an idea as to why codedestinations.entercode will not run on submit, but codesubmitDestinationscode will I want to believe that it has something to do with closures, because the function scope appears to be the only difference between the two functions.

Negative 23087 pI am new to Windows 8 App Store development and have bumped into something strange.p  pIf I create a normal .net library signed library and attempt to add it to my Windows Store application, Visual Studio 2012 moans that I cant add this project. Both projects are in the same solution.p  pThis project contains a reference to the System.Net assembly, as I use some of the types from there. I know that System.Net is not a fully supported namespace. TcpClient, NetworkStream, etc have all been removed. I also know that StreamSocket, DataReader and DataWriter in the Windows.Networking namespace is the alternative.p  pBefore I loose you, let me get to the point. Instead of adding the compiled assembly from this project as a project reference to the Windows Store application, I browse for the compiled assembly on my hard drive and reference the assembly directly.p  pTo my surprise, this worked This leads me to the following questionsp  ul liWhy That doesnt make sense to me. Someone please explain.li liAlso, if I use this library, will the Windows Store reject my application strongAnswering the second question myself... Answer is YES Windows Certification App, no longer recognises this as a Windows Store App if the mentioned library is referenced.strongli ul

Im trying to make an app that makes it easier to play a specific browsergamep  pMy idea was to load the website and let my app show an activity based on the content of this loaded site. The app basically shows no WebViews. Or can I make the WebView invisible somehowp  pAs you might have already realized, Im not that advanced with androidjava programming. although Im not that bad at HTMLCSS and really basic C So please try to keep the codes short.p  pThank you p
Negative 23087 pI am having a strange problem trying to get a small program running at boottime before any user has logged in.p  pI have used different methods of running the program at boot and nothing has helped me yet Anyway, I have a small Qt program that communicates with a different program via DBUS systembus. Currently the program is started with upstart and registers the service etc. fine on the systembus. I can also call different methods of the program using qdbus system, these methods return immediately with correct return values. I have set the Qt program to send a DBUS signal every second. when monitoring this with dbusmonitor i only see a signal being passed every 25 seconds but when I kill the program and log in as a user root the program sends its signals just fine every second.p  pHow is this possible I want the program sending the signals to run when the computer boots and have another user application connected to the signals to take action when the signal is received.p  pI have tried to run the program as an upstart job, using the init.d way and the normal rc.local way but all with the same result.p  pDo I have to have a user logged in for this to workp  pThanks,p  pSiscop

Negative 23087 pI have a MVC3 wep application that connects to a WCF service to get its needed data. This WCF service gets the data from a MS SQL 2008 R2 database using Entity Framework 5 Code First.p  pI have one call that gets data from the database, that has a lot of includes, but the data in the database is quite small. I have added a Stopwatch in the method that retrieves the data and logs how much time the actual data retrieval takes.p  pOn my machine when I start the service up fresh, the first time that method is run it takes around 3500ms. I guess this is because EF does something to check database consistency and so on. All calls after this takes 1040 ms and is perfectly acceptable.p  pOn the real server however, all calls regardless if its the first call or not takes 40005000ms, and that is unbearable. Calls to other methods that retrieve data shows the same symptoms, and is extremly slow on the server, but fast on my machine.p  pThe only differences between my machine and the server that I can see arep  pMy machine runs Windows7, has 8Gb memory, .NET framework 4.5 installed, MS SQL Server 2008 The server is a virtual machine runs Windows Server 2008 R2, has 4 Gb of RAM dedicated, .NET framework 4 installed and runs MS SQL Server 2008 R2.p  pAnyone knows why the data retrieval performance is so extremly slow on the server but not on my machinep

What I see now isp  pre webapp Maven Webapp war     Other Sources          srcmainresources     Dependencies     Project Files pre  pWhats missing here is srcmainwebapp, which is the directory for all my static files and web content. Of course, I can see it under the Files view, but I dont want to use the Files view. Why is it that I cant see this directory under the Projects viewp  pThanks in advance.p
Negative 23087 pIm creating bindings for a subset of wxWidgets using Boost Python. Window objects in wxWidgets should not be deleted manually since they handle their own deletion for example, when a top level window is closed by the user clicking the close button it automatically deletes itself. If a window emisem deleted strange things will happen with event handlers etc.p  pDetails a hrefhttpdocs.wxwidgets.org2.8wxwindowdeletionoverview.html relnofollowhttpdocs.wxwidgets.org2.8wxwindowdeletionoverview.htmlap  pThis however leads to a problem with window objects created in Python on garbage collection the C object is always deletedp  pIs there any way to tell Boost Python to not take ownership of C objects it creates Something like a call policy for the constructor perhapsp  pAlso, Im a little bit worried about how to handle objects deleted from C. What should happen to the Python object when an associated C object is deleted Python will not get notified about this in any way.p

Negative 23087 pI am creating a BASH script and working with the BASH codegetoptcode command to parse command line arguments.  Instead of returning the arguments provided on the command line, codegetoptcode returns the arguments that were supplied to the codegetoptcode command.

Negative 23087 pI did some java byte code generation using ASM.br By walking through some sort of AST of some kind of small DSL in visitor pattern.br And Im worrying about the generated byte code is too straightforward, that is, without any compiletime optimization.br Although in my case, that could be ok if the generated byte code is not optimized, still I cant help to ask is there a need for those projects which generate byte code at runtime to do bytecode optimizationbr I know the fact that for jvm, most of the optimization work is done while the program is running, by jit compilation. So the bytecode optimization at compile time may effect little.br But, really Is it absolutely meaningless to do bytecode optimization for the bytecode generated on the fly Is there any one to share some experience about the difference, mainly in runtime performance, between bytecodes with and without any form of optimization  p

In book they have only explained about code[Required]code and code[Datatype]code attribute.

Negative 23087 pWe have a number of policies about 150 or so we make available for download on our webpage.p  pRecently, Management had us move from all policies residing in one PDF to one policy per PDF.  Their reasoning was to make it easier for the end users to download the policy that they want, and to make it easier for us to replace them when they change.p  pNow, some end users are complaining that they want to download the whole set of policies as one large PDF.  Maintaining both formats as independent documents not only doubles our work, but increases the likelihood of error.p  pSince these are changed often, what I would like to do is to build a script to instruct Adobe Acrobat Pro to combine these individual policy PDFs together in a specific order.  p  pThis doesnt have to be a scrip since a GUI method would also work.  p  pCan this be done  If so, were can I look for examplesp

Negative 23087 pI have some code that was recently upgraded from EF 4.2 to EF 5.0 actually EF 4.4 since I am running on .Net 4.0. I have discovered that I had to change the syntax of my query, and Im curious as to why. Let me start off with the problem.p  pI have an EventLog table that is populated by the client periodically. For each event log an entry is created in a Report table. This is the query that is run periodically to discover any event logs that do not have an entry in the Report table yet. The query I used in EF 4.2 wasp  precodefrom el in repository.EventLogs where repository.Reports.Anyp gt p.EventLogID  el.EventlogID codepre  pSince upgrading to EF 5.0 I get the following error at runtimep  blockquote   pSystem.NotSupportedException Unable to create a constant value of   type Namespace.Report. Only primitive types or enumeration types   are supported in this context.p blockquote  pI discovered that rewriting it with the join syntax fixed the issue. The following works in EF 5.0 and is roughly the equivalentp  precodefrom eventLog in repository.EventLogs join report in repository.Reports on eventLog.EventlogID equals report.EventLogID into alreadyReported where alreadyReported.Any codepre  pSome people may have mixed opinions about the mixed syntaxstyle of the first query, but Im really more interested in the why of this. It seems odd that the EF 4.2 compiler could generate the SQL for the original query but that the EF 5.0 refuses. Is this a setting I am missing or just a tightening of constraints between the two Why is this happeningp

Negative 23087 pI am trying to draw parallels between ObjectiveC Category and features in Java and Ruby. Please see if these conclusions are accurate  p  pObjectiveC Category adds new methods to an existing class even when you do not have access to source code of the class. Java does not have anything similar but in Ruby you can open any class, including core language class like String. p  precodeclass String    def mynewmethod   new test method  end end  some string.mynewmethod gt new test method codepre  pSimilarly in ObjectiveC  you can reopen the NSString class using category. p  precodeimport NSStringForTest.h  implementation NSString ForTest  NSString myNewMethod    return new test method   end codepre  pHowever, one difference I see is that, in Ruby, once a class is opened and modified within a runtime, ALL subsequent uses of that class are affected, in other words it is a system wide change, while in ObjectiveC only code that imports this header file and any subclasses are affected.  Are there any other differences p

Negative 23087 pI am wondering what is the correct approach. First here is the test code.p  precodedescribe Something, gt     it should trigger event, done gt         spy  sinon.spy         instance  new Something         instance.onitsdone, spy         instance.methodCall         spy.should.have.been.calledOnce         done codepre  pLooks pretty straightforward, but since events are usually asynchronous, this cannot work.p  precodeclass Something     constructor gt         events       on event, cb gt         events[event]  new signals.Signal unless events[event]         events[event].add cb     methodCall gt          Fire up itsdone event when everything else is done         setTimeout gt events[itsdone].dispatch, 0 codepre  pThis way test will fail obviously. Then I thought about something like this...p  precodedescribe Something, gt     it should be triggering even, done gt         instance  new Something         instance.onitsdone, done         instance.methodCall codepre  pThis works correctly and when event is not triggered, test will fail after 2 seconds. However there is no verification, that it was triggered only once. Maybe I need another test for that  Since I already know its triggered at least once, I can use test with spy after this one probably. Although it seems too much hassle for one event.p  pAnother dirty approach could be thisp  precodedescribe Something, gt     it should be triggering even, done gt         spy  sinon.spy         instance  new Something         instance.onitsdone, spy         instance.methodCall         setTimeout gt             spy.should.have.been.calledOnce             done         , 0 codepre  pIt isnt probably really bulletproof. It would need bigger timeout probably to be sure. However that means tests will take longer to process, which is not good idea.p  pDo you have any other ideas how this should be solved p

Negative 23087 pDue to one agent wanting his website url on the functionality that I worked on a month ago I ended up having to make some minor changes. I have two function PHP pages that run a very similar script but I had to make two based of two value sets.

Once I had that done I was under the impression that it would be smoothing sailing from there..it was not... p  pI used the exact same statement for both of their scripts and only one works. The only thing that differs from them is what value it is receiving and that I use JavaScript  AJAX for the first one Which works and then decided to learn jQuery  AJAX to do the next one.

Switching from GoDaddy for this particular website is out of the question unfortunately.p  pSo Ive tried the following so farp  pUsing codesendmail emailexample.com lt logfile.logcode However, on GoDaddy sendmail isnt actually sendmail, it is a wrapper script emgdmailwrap.plem which checks email quotas before submitting to the real sendmail binary which is actually sendmail.realp  pSo then I tried just running the command to sendmail.real directly. It said the mail was successfully queued. I checked the queue frequency for sendmail and it is 1 hour. However, a whole day has gone by and nothing.p  pThere is also a sendmail.sendmail binary which also said the mail was queued but nothing was received by me either.p  pI checked for any other executable mail programs but couldnt find anything else that GoDaddy offers no mail or elm.p  pI then thought Id go more obvious and just let the cron job run a .php script with a simple mail call. I tested it through a browser and it works immediately and I get an email within seconds. However, when running it through cron on GoDaddy the cron command would be codewebcgibinphp5 HOMEtestmail.phpcode I get nothing. Yet this same php script works perfectly fine from the browser. And its not that the php script wasnt executed. I had to fwrite to a file with the status of the mail call which was TRUE, thus the mail should have at least been queued for delivery and the mail call gets to me within seconds from a browser.p  pI reasoned that maybe the php binary that runs from the browser is different from what the cron runs so I ran every php executable on the server through SSHp  precodewebcgibinphp5 webcgibinphp53 usrlocalphp53binphp53 usrlocalphp5binphp5cgi cgibinphp5 cgibinphp53  All with f testmail.php codepre  pAgain, no email. And the return value of each mail call was TRUE so they should have been queued for delivery just like everything else I tried.p  pSo in short, Im out of ideas on how to get GoDaddy to send me an email from a cron job. I have working cron jobs on many of my GoDaddy accounts and they work fine, however this is my first attempt at getting one to send an email.p  pThe only thing I can think of is coding an email client by hand, in perl or C or something, generating the headers and connecting to an smtp server elsewhere and all that jazz, and getting that to run through a cron job.p  pI also thought of, since I can get mail from a browser, I could just make it so the script that emails me my logs is accessible that way. However, Id really rather have a script like that below the public html directory.p  pIf I absolutely cant get my log files sent to me automated by GoDaddy, Ill just have to log in each day and download them manually as opposed to them being emailed to me.p  pI apologize for the crazy formatting of this post. Hopefully the main idea of what I want wasnt lost through my rambling.p  pSo again, if anyone has any ideas on how I could send an email from GoDaddy through a shell or cron job essentially being one and the same, Ill give it a try.p  pI thought getting my log files emailed to me each dayill get that set up in minutes 36 hours later.... p  p[EDIT] Ive worked on this for like 8 hours now in my spare time today and had over 80 tabs open in my browser to try possibilities. p  pThe best that Ive come up with for now is having a PHP script that connects to GoDaddys relayhosting.secureserver.net directly with fsockopen on port 25, and then send an email directly using the SMTP protocol. This does in fact work from a cron job or shell.p  pI was really hoping that I could just let a cron job simply run sendmail directly like regular nix sysadmins can do. If anyone else has any suggestions let me know. If not maybe Ill answer my own question with the full PHP script I come up with that will email me my logfiles daily from GoDaddy.p  pThanks again for your timep
Negative 23087 pThe following list has format ID, level, valuep  precode[A, 1, None,  B, 1, None,  C, 1, None,  A, 2, 1.1,  B, 2, 5.0,  C, 2, 5.0,  C, 3, 40,  B, 3, 55] codepre  pSo the catch is to sort items of the same emlevelem with the same emvalueem according to their values from one emlevelem lower. If values one emlevelem below are equal, it goes 2 levels below, and so on. So the end list should look like thisp  precode[A, 1, None,  C, 1, None, lt this moved up because  lvl3 C[value] lt B[value]  B, 1, None,  A, 2, 1.1,  C, 2, 5.0, lt this moved up because  lvl3 C[value] lt B[value]  B, 2, 5.0,  C, 3, 40,  B, 3, 55,] codepre  pCould somebody suggest an algorithm to achieve that Btw, I always get the starting list sorted by emvalueem and then by emlevelemp

Negative 23087 pI was not able to find a clear answer to my question, maybe I used the wrong search termp  pI want to record many images from a camera, with no compression or lossless compression, on a not so powerful device with one single solid drive. After investigating, I have decided that, if any, the compression will be simply png image by image this is not part of the discussion. Given these constraints, I want to be able to record at maximum possible frequency from the camera. The bottleneck is the only one hard drive speed. I want to use the RAM for queuing, and the few available cores for compressing the images in parallel, so that theres less data to write.p  pOnce the data is compressed, do I get any gain in writing speed if I stream all the bytes in one single file, or, considering that I am working with a solid drive, can I just write one file lets say about 1 or 2 MB per image still working at the maximum disk bandwidth or very close to it, like 90p  pI dont know if it matters, this will be done using C and its libraries.p

Negative 23087 pI would like to be able to validate a create form with related models before I initiate a save. I am saving an organization which has a number of related models. Since I have a number of manytomany relationships I have to create the primary model first then go through a laborious process of separately creating each related model from the input data. I call a createRelated method within the Organization repository after the initial organization is created.p  precodepublic function createRelatedinput      thisgtorgtypesgtattach1, [objectstateid gt ORGANIZATIONSTARTED]     thisgtaddressesgtcreatearrayonlyinput, [street1, zip, city, statecode]     for i0 i lt 2 i                ifinput[phonenumbers.i.number]                      thisgtphoneNumbersgtcreate[phonenumbertypeid gt input[phonenumbers.i.phonenumbertypeid], number gt input[phonenumbers.i.number]]                     thisgtproceduresgtattachinput[procedures]          input[objectstateid]  USERSTARTED     input[password]  thisgtencryptPasswordinput[password]     thisgtusersgtcreatearrayonlyinput, [firstname, lastname, email, password, objectstateid]     thisgtprofileElementsgtcreate[type gt shortdescription, content gt input[shortdescription]]  codepre  pHaving to call out each input and sending it to its appropriate model does NOT seem right to me, but that is what I heard on IRC as the right way. But now I come to validation and currently there is no validation on create for these models even though the input may violate the validation rules. I am surprised that there is no naming convention that I have seen that clearly identifies related model input so that it can all be validated and created without manual processing like the above.

Negative 23087 pSay I have a table called child that contains a foreign key referencing another table called parent. If the parent table contains column values I frequently want to access when SELECTing from the child table, is it better to JOIN the tables on the foreign key or store the columns im frequently accessing from the parent table a second time in the child table.p  pSometimes I also have a third grandchild table that references the child table and want a mixture of information from all 3 tables. A triple JOIN seems like im over complicating it.p  pI feel like theres a much better way to go about this. If anyone has advice or some good resources on this topic, let me know. p
Negative 23087 pI have a doubt related with my app. My app takes like 510 seconds to download all the data from my web service and also from twitter using STTwitterAPI, and i download all this content when the app just starts. The question is What you guys would do during this 510 secs Show an UIAlertView saying that the app is downloading content Load an Image to a UIImageView and once the data is downloaded delete the UIImageViewi dont know how to check that Is there any method that apple provides to give a solution to this questionp  pI just thought about setting a NSTimer for the UIImageview or the NSAlertView, the problem is that if i keep adding data to the server, or depending the connection of the user that is downloading the data, maybe the UIImageView goes away before all the data is already download. p  pWhat would be the best solution Does STTwitter have a method to check if all the data is downloadedp  pPD Sorry for my english, I tried hard p

Negative 23087 pI have a situation where I have a stored procedure that does a lot of  codeLEFT OUTER JOINcodes because I am retrieving two types of games, pools and brackets. They diverge off a main entity called game.  p  pAs of now I am grabbing all pool and bracket games in one stored procedure. Because pool games wont have bracket data I need to do a codeLEFT OUTER JOINcode on the pool query of the SQL and viceversa for the bracket games.  p  pI was thinking I could split these up into separate stored procedures and get rid of the codeLEFT OUTER JOINcode. Is this something that would speed up performancep  precodeALTER PROCEDURE [Test].[Test]     Page INT  1,     PageSize INT  10,     SortOrder NVARCHAR100  Id,     SortDirection VARCHAR4  ASC,

Negative 23087 pWhat techniques are there for creating a products grid that has padding between each item, but only within the grid For example, what I am trying to achieve is the belowp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.com00jhp.jpg altenter image description herep  pSample markupp  precodeltdiv idcontainergt     ltdiv classitemgt          lt content gt     ltdivgt ltdivgt codepre  pCSSp  precodecontainer  width 100 minwidth 960px  .item  float left width 300px height 100px  codepre  pin the above, code.itemcode is going to be output 9 times.p  pThe solution would need to be IE8 compatible and preferably using a technique that isnt a hack. I have tried using codedisplay tablecode with codeborderspacingcode property  but this outputs the padding on the outer sides too.p  pI know I can also add specific classes to items to control whether the padding is shown for that item, but I was hoping for a more automated solution.p  pEdit The padding width should be calculated dynamically, so for example if the container is 960px, the padding is going to be 30px wide.p  pSecondly, if there are less than 3 items on the last row, these should not appear centered on the row, i.e. if there are only two items then the last cell should just be empty.p  pEDIT All the solutions so far insist on specfying the width of the gappadding. strongI want to have the padding calculated dynamically.strong The only width I need to specify is that of code.itemcode, which is currently a fixed with of 300px.p

Negative 23087 pIm having a difficulty with a website for work.  Some users of Internet Explorer and Safari are not storing anything in their session  cookies and I need to find a way to store information while they are on the site.p  pIs there a way with phpjavascriptsomething else to request they add the site to their trusted sites or to allow cookies  sessions at all  Would having a certificate of any kind do this  Does anyone have any other suggestions of ways to do this  It would need to be an array of items to be stored and cant be stored in post  get formats as it involves leaving the page to go to a third party and then coming back to the page.p  pIn case youre concerned, its all above board in terms of what its doing.  Its all to integrate with a 3rd party system that doesnt allow the flexibility that the site requires when it comes to rules.p  pFor clarification The session has been used to store the information but a lot of complaints were coming back from people using internet explorer saying that the rules applied werent working.  These are dependent on information being stored to the session.  After testing we found that sessions werent storing on a lot of internet explorer browsers.  To combat this we have tried storing a key to a cookie and then using this to reference a database which stored this information instead.  However, we are finding that with higher security settings these arent working also.  It needs to function without having them log in.  This is the issue.p  pUPDATE I have tested and it appears that if a site has an SSL cert applied to it the issue doesnt exist.  Will need to confirm but that may be the answer.p

Negative 23087 pIn short, Im managing a bunch of versioned SQL Scripts where one requirement is that they need to be sort of backwards compatible in that the same scripts can be executed multiple times, still guaranteeing the same end result for the latest version. Basically, say we are on version 3. We need to be able to run scripts for versions 1, 2 and 3 over and over, without errors, and still guarantee that the end result is the same complete version 3.p  pNow this is easy with normal scenarios just check if column  table  type is right and create  modify if not, but how do you deal with for instance a trigger thats way over 8000 characters long and cant be executed as dynamic SQL As version 2 is installed, the triggers are dropped, at the end, new ones are created to match v2s datamodel. But if v3 removed one of the columns referred to by the v2 trigger, that trigger will now fail.p  pI cant make any kind of IF checks to see if our log has v3 scripts, or if the datamodel doesnt match the requirements. Id hate to make others do manual labor to do something Im sure can be automated one way or another. So is there any nice gimmick, trick or just something I missed that could helpp  pThanks for the help. p

Negative 23087 pWere in the process of rewriting a web application in Java, coming from PHP. I think, but Im not really sure, that we might run into problems in regard to connection pooling. The application in itself is multitenant, and is a combination of Separate database and Separate schema.p  pFor every Postgres database server instance, there can be more than 1 database named schemaxXXX holding more than 1 schema where the schema is a tenant. On signup, one of two things can happenp  ol liA new tenant schema is created in the highest numbered schemaXXX database.li liThe signup process sees that a database has been fully allocated and creates a new schemasXXX1 database. In this new database, the tenant schema is created.li ol  pAll tenants are known via a central registry also a Postgres database. When a session is established the registry will resolve the host, database and schema of the tenant and a database session is established strongfor that HTTP requeststrong.p  pNow, the problem I think Im seeing here is twofoldp  ol liA JDBC connection pool is defined when the application starts. With that I mean that all databases hostdatabase are known at startup. This conflicts with the signup process.li liWhen Im writing this we have 20 database servers with 1000 databases for a total sum of 100k tenant schemas. Given those numbers, I would need 201000 data sources for every instance of the application. Im assuming that all pools are also, at one time or another, also started. Im not sure how much resources a pool allocates, but it must be a non trivial amount for 20k pools.li ol  pSo, is it feasable to even assume that a connection pool can be used for thisp  pFor the first problem, I guess that a pool with support for JMX can be used, and that we create a new datasource when and if a new schemasXXX database is created. The larger issue is that of the huge amount of pools. For this, I guess, some sort of pool manager should be used that can terminate a pool that have no open connections and on demand also start a pool. I have not found anything that supports this.p  pWhat options do I have Or should I just bite the bullet and fall back to an out of process connection pool such as PgBouncer and establish a plain JDBC connection per request, similar to how were handling it now with PHPp

Negative 23087 pIm trying to write a program to smooth discrete digitized data for use in a motion simulator. The data will be provided as a set of t, xt points and is intended to be used to create cyclic motion thus the smoothed data must be not only continuous over the range of t values but also between the two endpoints. In addition, data provided will most likely be of significantly lower resolution than required and thus significant interpolation will take place.p  pIve looked at various techniques such as GaussNewton and LevenbergMarquardt curve fits, but these assume that an objective function is known beforehand and it will not be. Unfortunately the users of said motion simulator may not be able to choose an appropriate function due to their differing backgrounds. Finally, the code must be usable on a nonproprietary, crossplatform and preferably compiled language which can run on embedded platforms most likely Linux on ARM  this precludes the use of Maple which provides a generic fit routine that selects an appropriate objective function, Matlab similar IIRC or other mathrelated languages.

Negative 23087 pI have a largeish Win32 program that Im maintaining, and Id like to instrument it to automatically and unconditionally generate a minidump file whenever emsomething bad happensem. I cant ask customers to install userdump.exe, and I cant ask them to install visual studio. p  pIs there a good way of doing this Id like to be able to generate a minidump whether abort is called from our assert handler which is complicated, whether someone touches bad memory, or anything else really bad happens.p  pOn Posix, Id install a signal handler and be done with this. My understanding is that the equivalent approach on Windows is SEH, but our program starts up a lot of threads in a lot of different places so it would be very painful to wrap every thread entry point with a trycatch.p  pIdeasp

Negative 23087 pWhere is the flaw in my reasoning From my understanding yield works similar to a return statement that comes back to the generator to continue iterating. I was expecting the code to continue adding onto the list but I get an error.p  precodedef methodself     samplelist  []     whilecondition          the data is collected          samplelist  data          yield samplelist  finalList  file.method codepre  pEDIT My initial error was due to attempting to concatenate finalList using  when it didnt have an initialized value. This was resolved by using finalList.append, however, yield still isnt working and I would really appreciate it if someone could help me understand why.p  pThere was a fairly helpful answer posted and then deleted for some reason. But it explained that yield was really returning a generator object. From this I tried a few different things.p  p1 They also suggested to use listfile.method to iterate over it. However this further changed the type of finalList to a tuple and wasnt compatible with the rest of my code.p  p2 I tried to iterate over the object doingp  precodefor x in filewriter.writerecords     sample.appendx codepre  pBut with the same result. How can I append the values from the generator objectp

Negative 23087 pWhen I create a JUnit test and run it with Run AsJUnit test, Eclipse always wants to run the test with JUnit3 runner. I always have to go to Run Configuration then and manually set the current test to JUnit4 runner. This is absolutely annoying. I always get...p  blockquote   pNo tests found with test runner JUnit 3p blockquote  pIndeed, its an Android Maven project, and maybe Eclipse got some wrong information about running test within the project since Android uses JUnit 3, but actually it doesnt matter if its an Android project and there is nothing configured for JUnit 3, no Maven config, no build path config. Its always JUnit4.p  pI run a plain Junit4 test not on Android, so why does Eclipse always think to run the test with JUnit3 And where can I default it to JUnit4 The build path of the project contains JUnit 4.8.2 as well.

Negative 23087 pIm working with a weird data model no way around it at this point. Im using restangular to make a rest call to get back a single resource objectp  pNormally, the resource object returned by restangular is just whatever I set my  scope.resource  response to and I can do resource.name , resource.id in the viewtemplate, etc..p  pExcept this group of resources instead of returning the key, value pairs in the response object, it returns an object within an object like sop  precoderesource1 name value, stuff value, etc codepre  pwhich is fine because then I would just set my scope.resource  response.resource1 in my controllerp  pexcept the problem is, is that theres 5 different kind of resource object names so if I make a resource by id call I might get back resource2, resource4, resource1, etc. so setting my scope.resource  response.resource1 would only work when I get resource1.p  pMy first attempt to solve this was to just use ngrepeat in which I setp  precodeltul ngrepeatresource, value in resourcegt         ltli classlistgroupitemgt             Name             ltspan classpullrightgt  resource.name  ltspangt         ltligt ltulgt codepre  pwhich works great except because restangular returns all this extra stuff its looping through each object its repeating a bunch of blank html stuff if that makes sense.p  pMy other thought was to try making a constant and make an object that has all 5 resources there and my ngrepeat would only populate based off that constant object ie it would check for those strings resource1, resource2, etc and if its there then it will populate the template. But Im not exactly sure how to do this.p  pAny other options or are there ngrepeat features im just not utilizing any Help thanksp

Negative 23087 pSituationp  ol liI merged 2 assemblies Functionality.dll and Models.dllli liFunctionality calls codeRazorEngine.Razor.Parsetemplate, new Models.Modelcode simplified Functionality.dll references Models.dll and RazorEngine. a hrefhttpsrazorengine.codeplex.com relnofollowRazorEnginea is added to the GAC.

This 3th party tool loads this merged dll dynamically into its appdomain and executes it.li ol  pResult Exception is thrown codeUnable to compile template. The type or namespace name Models could not be found. are you missing an assembly referencecode p  pTo me this is weird, because the Models namespace is part of the merged assembly. And if I check with the debugger it is loaded. AppDomain.CurrentDomain.GetAssemblies.  BUT the merged assembly has no location. Assembly.Location  . I assume this is because it was dynamically loaded by the 3th party application And that causes the RazorEngine to throw this exception, because it adds references to all loaded assemblies by location codeparams.ReferencedAssemblies.Addlocationofdllcodep  pMy question isp  pHow can I make sure that my dynamically loaded, merged dll is correctly loaded into the appdomain so the RazorEngine can add a reference to it For me its not handy to ALSO put my merged dll into the GAC. I already uploaded it into my 3th party application. And that 3th party application has potentially multiple servers. I know, it is possible to add it in the GAC, and maybe thats what the GAC is for, but I was just wondering if I could somehow load my merged assembly again into the currently running AppDomain With a location so the RazorEngine can add a reference to it. Weird right The RazorEngine.dll runs in the same AppDomain as the merged dll. I doublechecked thatp  pLong question. Sorry for that. I hope someone can give me some pointers on how this all hangs together AppDomain, dynamically loaded, merged assemblies using a GAC assembly RazorEngine that needs to know the Types in the merged assembly.... pfftp  pThanksp

Negative 23087 pHere is the story. I have a simple app in which I use 2 tabs, both of them with UITableView. The first tabview is called codeFavoritescode and the second one is called codeMy Profile.code In addition I have a custom UITable cell named codeCustomViewCell.xibcode with an identifier of the same name. codeFavoritesViewControllercode is a subclass of UITableViewController and that one is running perfectly. But for the codeProfileViewControllercode I am using normal ViewController because I dont want the whole view to be UitableView. To make that possible, I the following to codeProfileViewController.hcodep  precodeinterface ProfileViewController  UIViewController ltUITableViewDelegate, UITableViewDataSourcegt  property nonatomic, strong IBOutlet UITableView tableView codepre  pthen in the codeviewDidLoadcode of ProfleViewController.m file I havep  precode[self.tableView registerNib[UINib nibWithNibNameCustomViewCell bundlenil]      forCellReuseIdentifierCustomViewCell] codepre  pThe following methods are implemented just as in the other tab thats workingp  precode NSIntegernumberOfSectionsInTableViewUITableView tableView        Return the number of sections.     return 1    NSIntegertableViewUITableView tableView numberOfRowsInSectionNSIntegersection        Return the number of rows in the section.     return [self.myArray count]     UITableViewCell tableViewUITableView tableView cellForRowAtIndexPathNSIndexPath indexPath         Here I am customizing the cell and returning it.   codepre  pWhen i run the app, the cells are the right height, but are empty.  To debug I put a break point right before cellForRowAtIndexPath, and the app runs without an error which it shouldnt. So, the program is not even getting to this method.

Negative 23087 pI am working on a relatively simple program in Unix, a clientserver interaction simulating a restaurant. Basically, the clients that enter the restaurantserver can order one or more dishes to send to the cook through a FIFO. The menu has to be set somewhere and be accessible by both server and client. It has to be an array of dish structures. My first idea was including all this in a custom header file In shared.hp  precode   typedef struct dish    char name [MAXLEN]     name of food    int id                  ID    int preptime            time needed to prepare it     dish     typedef struct request         pidt cpid              client pid    dish menu [MENUSZ]      array of dishes     request codepre  pIn this way the client chooses the dishes in a randomish way and sends the request to the server. My problem is how and where can I make a list of all the available dishes This dish list MUST be available for all the clients and defined apart. To give an example of what I mean, I have to do something similar to thisp  precode  dish dish1    dish1.name  Pasta   dish1.id  1   dish1.preptime  5 codepre  pSomething like this, a list stored somewhere and accessible by clients and server most likely that makes easier sending info to the server, so that I can just send the ID and the server already knows which food is it. Thanks in advancep

Negative 23087 pI read the C Language Specification on the emConditional logical operatorsem codecode and codeampampcode, also known as the shortcircuiting logical operators.

Why does this happen As you can tell, we could change the codeBcode getter to return a crazy object, like codeHello worldcode, and codexxcode would still evaluate to codetruecode without bindingproblems...p  pEvaluating codeA ampamp Bcode for codeyycode also leads to no bindingtime error. And here both properties are retrieved, of course. Why is this allowed by the runtime binder If the returned object from codeBcode is changed to a bad object like a codestringcode, a binding exception does occur.p  pstrongemIs this correct behavioremstrong How can you infer that from the specp  pIf you try codeBcode as first operand, both codeB  Acode and codeB ampamp Acode give runtime binder exception codeB  Acode and codeB amp Acode work fine as everything is normal with nonshortcircuiting operators codecode and codeampcode.p  pTried with C compiler of Visual Studio 2013, and runtime version .NET 4.5.2.p

Negative 23087 pI hope this question isnt to broad or subjective, but what I am looking for is whether there is or are wellestablished ways in to implement a Laravel framework within an existing website.p  pWe are currently using a custom CMS for our site, which covers 95 of our needs. However, Id like to make a subdirectory of which all of emitsem subdirectories implement Laravel. My concern is that Im not entirely sure how the innerworkings of Laravels Routing works and Im not sure whether or not our CMS does its own routing behind the scenes as well, so I wouldnt want to have conflicting URI issues of our CMS stepping on Laravels toes and vice versa.p  pIm only slightly familiar with the .htaccess rules, but would that a separate .htaccess in the Laravel subdirectory be the key to implementing Laravels Routing beginning at that folder down, and not for any of the other pages on the site And if our CMS does do its own routing, would the lowerlevel .htaccess override the higherlevel onep  pDoes any of this raise any red flags on problems that could arise later in developmentp

So, basically, it looks like thisp  ul liHair level 0 ul liHair level 1 ul liHair level 2li ulli liHair level 1li ulli ul  pNow, the issue Im having is this Lets say, for instance, I change a field in level 2.  I want Level 1 to be notified, but I dont know how to notify level 1. Is there a way I can have an object talk to the object thats containing it  Now, if I were using Android, maybe I could use a broadcast receiver, but Im not familiar with anything like this in Java or a way just DIRECTLY talk to the parent hair level.

Negative 23087 pI am working on a small practice program where I have 3 white boxes in a row.  My goal is using Javascript for any of the boxes to change from white to red when the mouse is over the box, and then to turn yellow when the mouse comes off the box.  The code below works on the initial box but not on the other two.  When I put the mouse over the other boxes, it doesnt change them but it does change the color on the inital box.  Ive looked at similar questions but most of them involve jquery, which I am not using.  Ive done some research and possible solutions might involve using addEventListener or using this.  I dont want to give different names to the button ids and write additional procedures based on them  that would be inefficient.  I know there must be a more efficient way.

Negative 23087 pI have a deeply nested configuration hassle.p  pThe problem happens to be in machine learning, where an enduser calling a crossvalidation routine, may, or may not specify any of various parameters e.g. randomSeed  17p  pEither way, the parameters then have to be passed first to the crossvalidation algorithm, and then on to a first machine learning algorithm. The machine learning algorithm, must be able to set and pass on other parameters, all without the initial user knowing.   p  pMost all of the consumers in the chain of parameter users expect a java Map interface to be doing the lookup from. p  pFlattening the keys into one library is unattractive for performance reasons  both CPU and memory   the root keyname space will be used without modification many thousands of times, and each time a number of additional parameters need to be specified before the bundle is passed along. p  pA decent analog is how the PATH variable works, each element in the path being a directory keynamespace. When a query is made against the PATH variable eg. you type emacs at the command line, it looks in each directory unnamed namespace of keys for that filename specified value in order, until it either finds it, or fails to find it.  If it finds it, you get to execute the specific contents of the executable file it found get the value of the parameter set. If you have a PATH variable from another, you can append a new directory  anonymous keyspace  in front of it as you pass that PATH variable setting along to a new enduser, without modifying the previous directories preferences.p  pGiven the namespace on the configuration parameters is effectively flat, a solution like Pythons a hrefhttpsdocs.python.org3librarycollections.htmlcollections.ChainMap relnofollowChainMapa would be perfect eg a hrefhttpsdocs.python.org3librarycollections.htmlchainmapexamplesandrecipes relnofollowexample usagea but Im finding no equivalent solution in Java  p

Negative 23087 pQuestion up front TLDR style since this is a longish post Is there a better way to kick off 2 chained commands i.e. cmd1cmd2 as background processes in a script while allowing the original script to exit fullyp  pA similar question to this was asked before 3 years ago, but it didnt cover my needs.  This question was ultimately answered by having the background process kick off emasem the script was exiting.  I have a specific need to have this background process kick off emafterem the script has exited.p  pI have a situation where I need a script to run fully and exit, but I need the script to execute 2 background tasks, in order after the script exits.p  pThe tasks are thesep  precodesleep 5 service proprietaryAgent restart codepre  pThe sleep is there only to give the originating script time to exit.  So I guess this command could take place emasem the script is exiting.  The rub is, the proprietaryAgent.  This agent is a mechanism thats allowing me to run a script remotely.  So restarting it during the script is problematic.  I need to run a script that will start a background job then exit, and that background job needs to be essentially wait a bit to give the original script time to fully exit, then restart this agent.p  pIve triedp  precodesleep 5service proprietaryAgent restart amp disown exit 0 codepre  pAnd Ive triedp  precodenohup sleep 5nohup service proprietaryAgent restart amp exit 0 codepre  pIm pretty sure I see the logic fail there, in that starting sleep as a foreground process, then the script owns the sleep 5 envocation and will not exit until sleep has completed, which restarts the proprietaryAgent as the script is exiting.  However, the requirement of this question is the proprietaryAgent must start AFTER the script exits, not during the exit or before.p  pI also triedp  precodetrap nohup sleep 5nohup service proprietaryAgent restart amp 0 exit 0 codepre  pBut trap detects the exit, and kicks off then runs fully, THEN allows the script to fully exit.  So that didnt work.p  pSo like a goober I triedp  precodenohup sleep 5 ampnohup service proprietaryAgent restart amp exit 0 codepre  pI dont honestly know what this does.  I tried it just to try it.  But in this context I think sleep is itself a background process, and disconnected from the chaining  that would cause the next command to wait on it.p  pLastly I tried this basically have a script write a 2nd script, and kick that off in the backgroundp  precodeecho binbash gt vartmprestartAgent.sh echo sleep 5 gtgt vartmprestartAgent.sh echo service proprietaryAgent restart gtgt vartmprestartAgent.sh chmod 755 vartmprestartAgent.sh  nohup vartmprestartAgent.sh amp exit 0 codepre  pI think Im close here, though it still needs troubleshooting, but its back to the original question.

Negative 23087 pim developing iOS application for some kind of video processing. This application should download videos from different sources it already works with photo stream, iPod library and external files. Now im trying to implement downloading video files from users Vimeo feed. ive created Vimeo API application, implemented authentication and implemented reading data from mefeed using VIMNetworking for iOS. Data in JSON format mapped to VIMVideo objects are successfully loaded and video information name, creation time, thumbnail picture and so on ... are successfully displayed in applications UICollectionView.

If the buffer is the same size or larger than the input, I get no output and no error. Am I closing a channel at the wrong time Do I have the wrong expectation about how buffers work Or, something elsep  precodepackage main  import      fmt     sync   var wg1, wg2 sync.WaitGroup  func main      share  makechan int, 10     out  makechan string     go printChanout     for j 1 jlt7 j          go readIntshare, out, j          for i1 ilt100 i          share lt i          closeshare     wg1.Wait     closeout     wg2.Wait  func readIntin chan int, out chan string, id int      wg1.Add1     for n  range in          out lt fmt.Sprintfgoroutined was sent d, id, n          wg1.Done  func printChanout chan string     wg2.Add1     for l  range out          fmt.Printlnl          wg2.Done  codepre  pTo run this Small buffer, expected output. a hrefhttpplay.golang.orgp4r7rTGypPO relnofollowhttpplay.golang.orgp4r7rTGypPOa Big buffer, no output. a hrefhttpplay.golang.orgpSBDsw7Ctu relnofollowhttpplay.golang.orgpSBDsw7Ctuap

Negative 23087 pI did a lot of research but couldnt really find an answer to this.p  pI used PHPExcel for reading raw data from an excel sheet. It works fine.  Now I need to get a SUM from cell codeA1code to codeA500code, i.e. codeSUMA1A500code. To do that, I understand I need to     p  ul liStep 1. Insert this formula to a cell using codesheet1gtsetCellValueB1, SUMA1A500code.li liStep 2. Use codesum  sheet1gtgetCellB1gtgetCalculatedValuecode to get the calculated value.li ul  pMy question is, is there any way to get the sum without the need of inserting the formula into a cell in the first place In other words, to achieve the result in Step 2 without Step 1. Because I dont want to addchangeedit anything onto the original excel sheet.  Thanks a lot.  p

Negative 23087 pstrongProblemstrongp  pI need to sanitize a collection of Strings from user input to a valid property name. p  pstrongContextstrongp  pWe have a DataGrid that works with runtime generated classes. These classes are generated based on some parameters. Parameter names are converted into Properties. Some of these parameter names are from user input.
