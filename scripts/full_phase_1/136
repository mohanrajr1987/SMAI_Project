Positive 136 pIm new to Azure App Services and Im not getting the point about Azure API Apps access control. As I understood, the API Apps services has built in features to enable authentication on the API using Azure ActiveDirectory or thirdparty services.p  pIn my case, Im studying to use this with ASP.NET 5 REStful services capabilities. In that way, Ill usually need to authorize or not the access to some endpoint based on the claims a user might have, because in order to authorize or not something is a matter of business rules instead of a simple allowdeny based on login.p  pAs I understood, Azure will just take care of authentication, it will redirect the client to the identity provider, will get the token and generate another token which will allow access to the API. But, how this connects with my app Is it possible, working that way, to deal with claims for users If so, how is this donep  pIm a little in doubt, because Im failing to see how this really connects with my app, in the sense of allowing me to do what Im already used to do.p

Ive setup a filter which doesnt allow words like SELECT, WHERE, UNION to be passed in which I guess makes it safer. I know codemysqliquerycode only allows one query to be run at once so theres some security there from concatenating updates onto the end of of selects.p  pDo I have any other options herep  pEdit I should probably add that if anyone is able to provide an example of an attack which is completely unavoidable without parameterized queries that would also be helpful. We have a query which looks like thisp  precodeSELECT pl.created p.LoginName, pl.usernameentered, pl.ipaddress FROM loginattempts pl LEFT JOIN people p ON p.PersonnelId  pl.personnelid WHERE p.personnelid  id AND pl.created gt date1 AND pl.created lt date2 codepre  pIve substituted a UNION query into the id codeUNION SELECT  FROM p WHERE 1  1code sort of thing and I can prevent that by not allowing SELECTUNION but then Im sure there are countless other types of attack which I cant think of.

Positive 136 pthe question title may not be cleared of what i am asking.p  pMy question is pretty general in all login system design with Facebookgoogletwitter, and how can i avoid a hacker to generate fake data to register on my application.p  pHere is more detail of what i want to askp  pWhen a person press login with Facebook and authenticated with facebook, my app should have this users email, userid and accesstoken, then i can use these data on my own database to create the user account and log in the user. strongSo here is what i cant figure outstrong. A hacker can easily generate a fake emailuseridaccesstoken and create a POST request to my server acting as a valid Facebook login.

Each object   created is assigned a unique object   key, stored as an integer,when it is   created. These keys start at 1 and   increment every time a new object of   any type gets created.p blockquote  pIf this is still true in .NET Framework 3.5 can someone please confirm, then the only problem I see with the default implementations of reference types is that the hash code will have a poor distribution. p  pIll break my questionsp  pa So it it recommended to override codeGetHashCodecode to if it is used in a codeDictionarycode or does the default implementation perform just fine p  pb I have reference types where it would be easy to do since they have fields that identify them uniquely but what about those reference types where all members are also reference types.

Negative 136 pIve been getting frustrated with some subversion conflicts ive been getting for a long time now.p  pIm talking about when I do an update on a file and it says there are conflicts, so I open the file and theres no ltltltlt  stuff in there.  In tortoisesvn or visualsvn I go Edit Conflicts and there are no red conflict zones.  On the file system there are 2 additional files generated from the conflict... p  pIve been using subversion for several years and only in the past year on my work machine has this behavior been occurring.  Because of this Ive stomped many of my team mates commits because of the conflicted state with that doesnt display conflicts.p  pI had a team mate commit append a few characters to a line and this happened again today.  There is no way this should be happening, is a configuration file on my machine messed up or is there a bug in subversion  Anybody else have this happenp  pThanksp  pTO MAKE THINGS ABSOLUTELY CLEAR...p  pWhen there is a conflict... I want there to be ltltltltltltltltltltlt   stuff in my file.  And when I say edit conflict it should show me the conflicts. When for some stupid reason SVN cant merge the revisions, and flags the file as a conflict, SHOW ME THE CONFLICTS. Its no use to me if SVN just dumps 2 files to disk, one of my current revision and another of trunk.  If I have to compare files manually then what good is source control.  If it cant merge show me the conflicts.  Somethings gotta be screwy.p

Negative 136 pWhen dealing with large collections, which of the following approaches is betterp  pClass SimpleObject with only fieldsproperties and class SimpleObjectController that contains all the method implementations required by SimpleObject. At runtime, I build a collection of SimpleObjects, instantiate one SimpleObjectController and call its methods, passing the SimpleObject I want to work with.p  porp  pClass ComplexObject that aggregates the SimpleObject and SimpleObjectController in the traditional OO approach. At runtime I have a collection of ComplexObjects, iterate over them, calling their methods as needed.p  pIt has been suggested to me that the first approach is preferable in terms of memory usage as all the heavyweight code is only in one object instead of each one in the collection. My understanding was that if we had 1000 of these objects in a collection, that doesnt mean there is 1000 of the same method implementations sitting in memory. There would be 1000 instances of the data, but they would share the one code instance x86 code segment amp data segment. It also seems to fly in the face of general OO principles and encapsulation.p

Negative 136 pOk,p  pSo Ive tried to make an application which relies on images being scaled by an individual factor.

Negative 136 pAnother jquery calculation question.p  pIve this, which is sample code from the plugin site that I am playing with to get this workingp  precode        function recalc     [idtotalitem].calc         qty  price,                  qty input[nameqtyitem],          price input[namepriceitem],         ,          function s return s.toFixed2,          function this var sum  this.sum              grandTotal.val                  round the results to 2 digits                 sum.toFixed2                             codepre  pChanges in the price fields cause the totals to updatep  precode        input[namepriceitem].bindkeyup, recalc         recalc codepre  pProblem is I wont know the value of the price fields, they will be available to me only as a substring of values entered by the user, call it itemcode. There will be a variable number of items, based on a php query.p  pIve come up with this to change the price based on the itemcodep  precode    input[nameitemcodeitem1].keyupfunction       var codeprice  this.value.substring2,6     input[namepriceitem1].valcodeprice   input[nameitemcodeitem2].keyupfunction       var codeprice  this.value.substring2,6     input[namepriceitem2].valcodeprice  codepre  pHowever while it does that, it also stops the itemtotal from updating. Also, I feel there must be a way to not need to write a numbered function for each item on the list. However when I just usep  precode    input[nameitemcodeitem] codepre  pupdating any itemcode field updates all price fields, which is not good.p  pCan anyone point me in the right direction I know I am a bit clueless here, but javascript of any kind is not my thing.p  pOk, updating this now to add some html. Basically though this is now just a little piece of sample stuff from the jquery calculator site, which I am using to get the functionality right before puttng it all into the actual functioning script.

Negative 136 pI am drawing custom UITableViewCells.  My cells are opaque and are completely drawn in the drawRect of the cell to help with performance.  I want to handle the look of a selected cell myself.  If I dont, then the contents of my cell is covered up by the selectedBackgroundView that is added.  Is it common or acceptable to override the setSelectedanimated method of my cell so this is done properly.  I guess if I did that, then I would not call the supers setSelected method since I would be handling how the cell will show that its selected.  I would also have to set the selected property of the cell.p  pAny help would be great.  Thanks.p

Negative 136 pIve been having quite a bit of trouble with Google Maps API and a database driven map. In a previous question I had inquired about faster geocoding of addresses to a map and basically what I need to do is store LatLng into the database and create a map from there, instead of geocoding while the map is loading.p  pHowever, Im unsure exactly how to do this. I know the basic premise  1 User registers and enters in their address. 2 Database should store the users information, along with the address. 3 Address needs to be geocoded and then added to the LatLng fields in the database. 4Markers can then be placed on the map by looping through a query involving the LatLng fields.p  pAny ideas how to do this Im using ColdFusion, SQL Server. p

Negative 136 pWhile installing an application onto a clients server, I would like to make sure that the client or a future developer for them, etc does not copy my application and place it on other domainsserverslocal servers.p  pHow can I verify that my application is running on the server I installed it on I do not want any substantial lag in the script every time it runs, so I assume a handshake method is not appropriate.p  pI was thinking the script could request a PHP page on my own server every time it runs. This could send my server their server info and domain name, which my script can check against a database of accepted clients. If the request is invalid, my server handles the work of emailing me the details so I can follow it up. This should not slow down the clients script as it isnt expecting a response, and will still operate on their invalid server until I can investigate this and follow it up with them personally.p  pIf this is the best method or if there is better, what PHP call should I be making to request my servers script codefilegetcontentscode, codecurlcode and similar seem to always retrieve the response, which I dont need.p  pstrongUPDATEstrongp  pThank you all for your responses. I completely understand that PHP is open source and should be freely available to edit. I should have stated more clearly initially, but my intentions were for this verification method to assist me in finding anyone breaching my license agreement. The application is covered under a license, but I would also like to include this check so that I can monitor an initial misuse of my application.p  pHence, somebody may still breach my license and it would most likely go unnoticed, but if I implement this script I have the advantage of any lazy robbers who dont break apart my application and remove the verifier before ripping it.p  pDoes this justify the use of such a script If so, is cURL my best optionp

Negative 136 pI have a program that has a ton of sensors producing data at a fairly high rate, and consumers that need to consume it.  The consumers consume at very different rates.p  pSince I am using IObserverIObservable, the trivial solution was to simply create a Task for each event and wrap the OnNext call and the data in a lamda.  This worked very well, I was surprised how little overhead there was over raw calls.p  pThe problem is that some of these consumers need the order of events strictly enforced, and cannot miss any events.  PerferFairness isnt good enough.p  pThe best solution I have come up with is instead of wrapping the eventOnNext pair, to wrap an Insert into a ParallelQueue, one queue per consumer, and have a thread on the other end of the Queue to make the OnNext calls.p  pThree immediate problems with this approach.  Its much, much slower than the TaskOnNext wrapping solution.  There is no Blocking Dequeue or is there for ParallelQueue so the implementation is a bit tricky.  The third is that this seems such a common problem that I cant imagine there isnt some way to enforce order that I missed, maybe something like multiple task factories sharing an underlying pool, each Factory with some setting that makes them strictly enforce order.p  pAnyone know the proper way to achieve what Im trying to dop  pEDIT  Any solution that involves a thread per consumer or producer doesnt work.

Negative 136 pI am using mercurial for source control. I want to have a main dev branch, and then have points in time that align with say v1.0 v1.01 and v2.0, so that at any time I can pull down say v2.0 and crush some bugs on it. I have heard some people say I need tags, some say I need bookmarks, others say I need named branches, and still others say I just need to maintain multiple cloned repositories. p  pFrom my point of view, multiple cloned repos seems like a poor choice because one thing I like about DVCS is that once you clone the repo, you have all past history and can totally restore from someones laptop if your central server burns down. If your repo is split up all over the place, I feel like you lose this benefit, unless you expect people to clone 5 repos and maintain them on their computers locally. This concerns me because the majority of people say that this is a good way to do it, yet it logically doesnt make sense to me. I understand this is not a proper way to do backups, but not having full access to a part of the repo without going back to the server seems odd to mep  pSo to me, the way to keep everything together must be either tags, named branches, or bookmarks. However, I cant seem to differentiate these. People tend to explain bookmarks as kinda like tags, with some caveats and named branches as some kind of a moving tag that is probably better done with clones. p  pI really like git style branching single repo, multiple branches off of it, however, I do not want to resort to weird plugins or hacks to make it look like git. I want to understand the proper mercurial way. p  pBonus how do smallscale branches fit into the mix, i.e. you want to work on a small feature in its own branchp
Negative 136 pIm trying to display html table of values with about 20 columns  where say staff users see one subset of columns, and nonstaff users see another subset of columns.  I may want to define further types of users later.  Now right now I have three static header rows so the template looks like p  precodelttablegt lttrgt   ltthgtCol Altthgt    if user.isstaff ltthgtCol Bltthgt endif    ...    if not user.isstaff ltthgtCol Kltthgt endif  lttrgt lttrgt   lttdgtCol A second headerlttdgt    if user.isstaff lttdgtCol B second headerlttdgt endif    ...    if not user.isstaff lttdgtCol K second headerlttdgt endif lttrgt lttrgtlttdgtCol A third headerlttdgt  ...  lttrgt   for obj in objectlist  lttrgt   lttdgt obj.cola lttdgt    if user.isstaff lttdgt obj.colb lttdgt endif    ...    if not user.isstaff lttdgt obj.colk lttdgt endif  lttrgt  endfor lttablegt codepre  pHowever, I find nonDRY as every time, if I want to change if a usertype can see a column, I have to change it in 4 places.  Or if I want to define multiple different classes of users, Id have to have complicated if statements.  Id prefer something likep  precode  if showcola lttdgtobj.cola lttdgt endif  codepre  pWhere I can define at the top of the template or possibly in the view that user.isstaff can see showcola.  Is something like this possible  Im using a generic view objectlist.  Maybe modify all users to have attributes user.showcola somehow and do  if user.showcola   Im not sure how to add boolean attributes to users.p  pEDIT May want multiple users with custom views e.g., staffview adminview, unprivileged, etc., so if statements would get unwieldy.  A cells contents is typically more complicated than  obj.colb  tried simplifying problem to get to the point.  E.g.p  precodelttdgt if obj.customaddress     obj.customaddress.webprintsafe   else     obj.business.address.webprintsafe   endif lttdgt codepre  pAlso while multiple templates would work with a simple switch like      if user.isstaff          include templatestaff.html       else  if user.isadmin          include templateadmin.html       else          include templateother.html       endif       endif p  pI find its not DRY at all e.g., every edit to a template has to be replicated in three  template.  I guess I could make a script that read generates the three templates from some supertemplate outside of django but its getting very inelegant.p

Negative 136 pI notice a pattern, when i did C and backend programming in C or any language all my classes are neat and tidy. Recently i notice all my code are in a class and i literally have 50functions in it. I now realize its because i am doing UI. If i were to separate them by pages or formsdialogs i would have a LOT MORE files, more lines of code and longer line of code. If i separate them i get the same problem more files, lines, longer lines. Obviously the less lines the better less code  less to debug, change or break during maintenance.p  pThis specific project is 5k lines with 2k being from the web or libraries. All my .cs files are lt1k lines. Is this acceptable even though i have 50functions in a single classp  pBonus I notice most of these functions are called only once. and putting certain code blocks such as one function make two calls to the db as their own function makes it harder for me to edit since they are divide between files and this balloon function count. So, i kind of dont know what to do. Do i create more classes to reduce function count per class, it will increase function calls overall and already most are only called once  How do i design classes doing frontendUIp

Negative 136 pBefore I even ask, let me get the obvious answer out of the way emThe codeICollectionltTgtcode interface includes a codeRemovecode method to remove an arbitrary element, which codeQueueltTgtcode and codeStackltTgtcode cant really support since they can only remove end elements.emp  pOK, I realize that. Actually, my question is not specifically about the codeQueueltTgtcode or codeStackltTgtcode collection types rather, its about the design decision of not implementing codeICollectionltTgtcode for emanyem generic type that is essentially a collection of codeTcode values.p  pHeres what I find odd. Say I have a method that accepts an arbitrary collection of codeTcode, and for the purpose of the code Im writing it would be useful to know the size of the collection. For example the below code is trivial, for illustration onlyp  precode Argument validation omitted for brevity. static IEnumerableltTgt FirstHalfltTgtthis ICollectionltTgt source      int i  0     foreach T item in source              yield return item         if i gt source.Count  2                      break                codepre  pNow, theres really no reason why this code couldnt operate on a codeQueueltTgtcode or a codeStackltTgtcode, except that those types dont implement codeICollectionltTgtcode. They emdoem implement codeICollectioncode, of courseIm guessing mainly for the codeCountcode property alonebut that leads to weird optimization code like thisp  precode OK, so to accommodate those bastard QueueltTgt and StackltTgt types,  we will just accept any IEnumerableltTgt... static IEnumerableltTgt FirstHalfltTgtthis IEnumerableltTgt source      int count  CountQuicklyltTgtsource      ...     Then, assuming weve got a collection type with a Count property,  well use that... static int CountQuicklyltTgtIEnumerable collection       Note I realize this is basically what Enumerable.Count already does      minus the exception I am just including it for clarity.     var genericColl  collection as ICollectionltTgt     if genericColl  null              return genericColl.Count           var nonGenericColl  collection as ICollection     if nonGenericColl  null              return nonGenericColl.Count            ...or else well just throw an exception, since this collection      cant be counted quickly.     throw new ArgumentExceptionCannot count this collection quickly  codepre  pWouldnt it make more sense to just strongabandon the codeICollectioncode interface completelystrong I dont mean drop the implementation, of course, as that would be a breaking change I just mean, stop using it, and simply implement codeICollectionltTgtcode with explicit implementation for members that dont have a perfect matchp  pI mean, look at what codeICollectionltTgtcode offersp  ul licodeCountcode  codeQueueltTgtcode and codeStackltTgtcode both have this.li licodeIsReadOnlycode  codeQueueltTgtcode and codeStackltTgtcode easily emcouldem have this.li licodeAddcode  codeQueueltTgtcode could implement this explicitly with codeEnqueuecode, as could codeStackltTgtcode with codePushcode.li licodeClearcode  Check.li licodeContainscode  Check.li licodeCopyTocode  Check.li licodeGetEnumeratorcode  Check duh.li licodeRemovecode  emThis is the only one that codeQueueltTgtcode and codeStackltTgtcode dont have a perfect match for.emli ul  pAnd heres the real kicker codeICollectionltTgt.Removecode emreturns a codeboolcodeem so an explicit implementation for codeQueueltTgtcode could totally for example check if the item to be removed is emactuallyem the head element using codePeekcode, and if so, call codeDequeuecode and return codetruecode, otherwise return codefalsecode. codeStackltTgtcode could easily be given a similar implementation with codePeekcode and codePopcode.p  pAll right, now that Ive written about a thousand words on why emIem think this would be possible, I pose the obvious question strongwhy emdidntem the designers of codeQueueltTgtcode and codeStackltTgtcode implement this interfacestrong That is, what were the design factors which I am probably not considering that led to the decision that this would be the wrong choice Why was codeICollectioncode implemented insteadp  pI am wondering if, in designing my emownem types, there are any guiding principles I should consider with respect to interface implementation that I might be overlooking in asking this question. For example, is it just considered bad practice to explicitly implement interfaces that arent fully supported in general if so, this would seem to conflict with, e.g., codeListltTgtcode implementing codeIListcode Is there a emconceptualem disconnect between the concept of a queuestack and what codeICollectionltTgtcode is meant to representp  pBasically, I sense that there must be a pretty good reason codeQueueltTgtcode for example emdoesntem implement codeICollectionltTgtcode, and I dont want to just go blindly forward designing my own types and implementing interfaces in an inappropriate manner without being informed and fully thinking through what Im doing.p  pI do apologize for the superlong question.p

Negative 136 pI have a built a web application that now has a requirement of storing user credentials for access to another system.  As much as I would like to emnotem do this, unfortunately I have no choice in the matter.p  pMy web application interfaces with a Windows domain controller over LDAP to verify user accounts.  So, when the user logs into my application, the application checks LDAP to make sure they are a valid user and their password is correct.  Once authenticated, the users miscellaneous data is loaded from a MySQL database.p  pNow, I need to store a username and password for this other system in this database somehow, and I am exploring the most secure way to do it.p  pOne method I have considered was encrypting the credentials for this other system using the users domain password as verified by LDAP as the encryption key.  This way if someone did get the database somehow, it wouldnt be of much use as each record would be encrypted with a different hopefully anyway key, and that key wouldnt be present in the web application itself anywhere.  The problem with this method is that when the user changes their password, the saved credentials for the other system are no longer valid.  I would then have to prompt again for the other system credentials.  I am not opposed to doing this, provided that there isnt another method.p  pAny thoughts  Thank you for your time.p  pstrongEditstrong Something else I just thought of was encrypting based on some other data exposed for LDAP. One value that looks promising and also probably insecure to anyone on the domain is the codeobjectGUIDcode, which I assume is the GUID for the account.  I might use this the encryption key.  Is this easy to find by domain users or othersp  pstrongEdit 2strong  I have found that any domain users can easily look up the GUID via LDAP, so I have decided that method is out.  I may have to encrypt based on the user password, unless there are other recommendations.p

Negative 136 pAssuming I have one database keeping a simple history with multiple front ends talking to it one front end per server, I wonder what are the common solutions to deal with time. As soon as I have multiple servers, I cannot assume a global consistent clock, and I was interested in the possible solutions to maintain some kind of ordering between requests.p  pFor a concrete example, lets say I want to record histories of customers, where history is defined as time ordered set of records. The record table would be as simple as customerid, time, data, and history would be all the rows where customerid  requested id. Each request sent by the user would contain one record sent to one customer. Ideally, the time should refer to the actual time the request was sent to the front end by the customer as thats the time as seen from the user POV. To be exact, I only care about preserving the ordering between records for each customer, not about the absolute time.p  pI am aware of solutions such as vector clocks, etc... but that seems rather complex, and I would expect this to be a rather common issue p  pSolutions which are not acceptable in my casep  ul liChanging the requests arriving at the front end I unfortunately have to work under the constraint that the requests are passed as is. I have complete control of whatever communication protocol is needed between front ends and database, though.li liServer time clocks are synchronized li liAll request which require being ordered to each other are handled by the same front end serverli ul  p[EDIT] the question may sound a bit like redherring, so here is my rationale for asking it while this is not my issue right now, I am interested in the possibility to go to a platform like Google App Engine, which explicitly says that their servers are not guaranteed to be time synchronized. The solution to that issue for request ordering does not sound obvious to me  but maybe something like vector clock is actually the only good solution p

Negative 136 pIm having a strange, and very random bug occur within an OpenGL live wallpaper that Im developing.p  pMy code is structured in such a way that the OpenGL scene pauses and then resumes when the user enters and exits the Preferences screen. Initially it worked wonderfully, but after implementing more features thus creating a bit more overhead the live wallpaper occasionally freezes when exiting the Preferences screen. Logcat kicks out the following message which Ive personally never encountered before and repeats the message every second or so until I manually back out of the wallpaperp  precodeWSharedBufferStack10715 waitForConditionLockCondition timed out identity4902, status0. CPU may be pegged. trying again. codepre  pWhats odd is how random it is. Sometimes it doesnt occur for 50 preferenceexits or more. Other times it happens more frequently.

Negative 136 pI am registering a callback that I want to access asynchronously. This callback will be executed for validation before form submit.

The callback is registered in a usercontrol on the page instead of the page itself.p  pI can change the form action on the clientside after I make the calls, but Id rather take care of it all in the callback registration.

Negative 136 pEDIT The solution is in the comment below my question.p  pIm unsure why my app is force closing.  Recently I had deleted an xml file named directory.xml and a java class file named Directory.java, and added in 4 xml and java files directory1.xml, directory2.xml, directory3.xml, directory4.xml, Directory1.java, Directory2.java, Directory3.java, Directory4.java.  I updated the manifest to include these changes.  There are buttons I have on a layout called mainselect.xml.  Four buttons are the buttons that have onclick listeners set up on them to call the java files Directory14.java, which simply sets the content layout to the associated .xml file.  It all sounds so simple.p  pHowever, after looking at my LogCat, I noticed it said thisp  precode0812 102650.973 ERRORAndroidRuntime1205 FATAL EXCEPTION main 0812 102650.973 ERRORAndroidRuntime1205 java.lang.RuntimeException Unable to start activity ComponentInfoaround.lowellaround.lowell.Main java.lang.NullPointerException 0812 102650.973 ERRORAndroidRuntime1205     at android.app.ActivityThread.performLaunchActivityActivityThread.java2663 0812 102650.973 ERRORAndroidRuntime1205     at android.app.ActivityThread.handleLaunchActivityActivityThread.java2679 0812 102650.973 ERRORAndroidRuntime1205     at android.app.ActivityThread.access2300ActivityThread.java125 0812 102650.973 ERRORAndroidRuntime1205     at android.app.ActivityThreadH.handleMessageActivityThread.java2033 0812 102650.973 ERRORAndroidRuntime1205     at android.os.Handler.dispatchMessageHandler.java99 0812 102650.973 ERRORAndroidRuntime1205     at android.os.Looper.loopLooper.java123 0812 102650.973 ERRORAndroidRuntime1205     at android.app.ActivityThread.mainActivityThread.java4627 0812 102650.973 ERRORAndroidRuntime1205     at java.lang.reflect.Method.invokeNativeNative Method 0812 102650.973 ERRORAndroidRuntime1205     at java.lang.reflect.Method.invokeMethod.java521 0812 102650.973 ERRORAndroidRuntime1205     at com.android.internal.os.ZygoteInitMethodAndArgsCaller.runZygoteInit.java858 0812 102650.973 ERRORAndroidRuntime1205     at com.android.internal.os.ZygoteInit.mainZygoteInit.java616 0812 102650.973 ERRORAndroidRuntime1205     at dalvik.system.NativeStart.mainNative Method 0812 102650.973 ERRORAndroidRuntime1205 Caused by java.lang.NullPointerException 0812 102650.973 ERRORAndroidRuntime1205     at around.lowell.Main.onCreateMain.java22 0812 102650.973 ERRORAndroidRuntime1205     at android.app.Instrumentation.callActivityOnCreateInstrumentation.java1047 0812 102650.973 ERRORAndroidRuntime1205     at android.app.ActivityThread.performLaunchActivityActivityThread.java2627  0812 102650.973 ERRORAndroidRuntime1205     ... 11 more codepre  p..which seems to be saying it cant start the Main activity main.xml leads to mainselect.xml by pressing a button, by the way.

I use iMemoryCache.Defaulti to store keyvalue pairs, nothing big. Nevermind policies and expire times, if got that. The thing that mystifys me is why my cache gets cleaned out after If accessed a key retrived the value the first time. If i dont access the cached item, eventually the item will expire and my remove handler is called  its all good. But when i retrive the item the first time, my remove handler is called after a short while. The iChacheEntryRemovedReasoni is set top  precodeCacheSpecificEviction  A cache entry was evicted for as reason that is defined by a particular cache implementation. codepre  pI cant find any explanation to what this means. The mystifying thing here is that when i inspect the cache object when debugging in the handler and on succeeding controller calls, the cache enum is empty. If I set add a new CacheItem to the cache, I can yet again access the key once, and history repeats. The behavior is like a oneoff caching mechanism which i totally dont need.

This therefore means if a CSRF attack occurs, the state value of the CSRF attack client side wont match that of SESSION[state] hence the code does not proceed and the attack is prevented.p  pPlease correct me if I am wrongp
Negative 136 pI am wondering, is there any way to omit a javascript file from Chrome Developer Tools debugger, so it will automatically skip over any function calls made to that script p  pI ask because my projects often include large libraries such as jQuery. When I step through javascript in Chrome Developer Tools while debugging, I have to step through jQuerys lib every time I make a jQuery call in my script. p  pI end up having to set breakpoints one line after every call to the jQuery object. Its the only way I have found to skip past and its very annoying.p

Negative 136 pSo I am checking the the scrollHeight of some dynamically generated content to determine whether or not to include a more button in the content. The user can click the more button to expand the content and see everything inside. However using the same function every time sometimes it says the scrollHeight of the elements is 0 which needless to say breaks the function for those elements. I am beyond boggled as to why this function would work 90 of the time but sometimes say the elements dont have a scrollHeight when they clearly do they take up space on the page.p  pHere is the functionp  precodefunction hideshowexpandbuttonlength     var currentdiv       var currentspan       console.loglength     forvar i  0 i lt length i         ifdocument.getElementByIdmessagespani             currentdiv  document.getElementByIditemscontenti             currentspan  document.getElementByIdmessagespani             console.logcurrentdiv.scrollHeight, height of the div             ifcurrentspan.scrollHeight gt 128 ampamp currentdiv.scrollHeight lt 170                 console.loginside of the check for the conversation screen                 currentdiv.innerHTML lta href idexpandcolapsebuttoni classexpandcolapsebuttonconversation stylecolorblue onclickexpandcolapse i  gtMore...ltagt              else ifcurrentspan.scrollHeight gt 128 ampamp document.getElementByIditemscontenti.scrollHeight gt 200                  currentdiv.innerHTMLlta href idexpandcolapsebuttoni classexpandcolapsebuttonattatchment stylecolorblue  onclickexpandcolapse i  gtMore...ltagt              else ifcurrentspan.scrollHeight gt 128 ampamp currentdiv.scrollHeight lt 200                 currentdiv.innerHTML lta href idexpandcolapsebuttoni classexpandcolapsebutton stylecolorblue onclickexpandcolapse i  gtMore...ltagt                             codepre  pAs you can see I am checking the scrollHeight on the span and on the div because I have a couple of different types of cells that are being generated and I have to place the more button in different places depending on the type of cell.  This function only gets called at the end of the function that generates the content being checked and I have tried it with a codesetTimeoutcode call on the miniscule chance that it was going through this function before they were fully created I dont know how that would happen but who knows. p  pP.S. This is all taking place inside of a chrome ext. I dont think that has anything to do with it but who knows. Also the position on the elements is relative as I have seen others post about scrollHeight issues with codeposition absolutecode.p  pEdit to make more specificp  pHopefully this helps, the cells I am trying to measure are in a containing div that gets its display set to none several different ways. What is happening above happens in one of the instances where I have navigated away set display to none from the container and then navigated back to it set display to block. You can do this in about a dozen ways inside of the chrome ext. but it only says they dont have a scrollHeight or any height for that matter I tried using codegetBoundingClientRectcode and it returned 0 for everything for one case which is why I am confused.p  pAlso might be useful to know, on navigation back to the container the cells are rebuilt every time and as I stated above my function to get the scrollHeight is called at the end of the function to build the cells. So everytime you get back to the container my function is also called.p

Negative 136 pI have an app that plays some sounds at certain points in the apps life cycle.

Negative 136 pIve been stuck on this one for a while and any advice would be greatly appreciated.  Ive created a singleton object called SharedUser that represents the user who is currently using the app.  This SharedUser object has two NSStrings for username and userId and an NSArray for the company departments to which the user belongs.  The user is initialized upon login with a method called initWithUsername.  Inside this method the username is used to parse the user and get the users unique id number and the the users departments.p  pMy problem is as follows when I get the user through the sharedUser method at a later point in the app, the userId string is empty and causes an excbadaccess error when I try to use it.  I know that the userId string is being initialized though because I have observed this happening in the debugger.  However, strangely enough, the username string still exists for the same object that is lacking the userId string.  Im very confused as to how the memory behind userId could be released while username would still hang around.  p  pMy SharedUser class looks like thisp  precodeimplementation SharedUser synthesize userId synthesize username synthesize departmentIds  static SharedUser sharedUser  nil  SharedUser sharedUser   synchronizedself          if sharedUser              sharedUser[[self alloc] init]                   return sharedUser    idallocWithZoneNSZone zone      synchronizedself          if sharedUser  nil               sharedUser  [super allocWithZonezone]              return sharedUser                    return nil    idcopyWithZoneNSZone zone      return self     idretain      return self     unsignedretainCount      return NSUIntegerMax     oneway voidrelease       never release     idautorelease      do nothing     id init      synchronizedself          [super init]         username           userId           departmentIds  nil         return self          void initWithUserNameNSString  loginName       username  loginName      create a request and a connection         NSURL url  [NSURL URLWithStringhttpblah.comurlforthejson]        ASIHTTPRequest request  [ASIHTTPRequest requestWithURLurl]     [request startSynchronous]     NSError error  [request error]      if error           NSString responseString  [request responseString]         NSArray listOfPeopleDictionaries  [responseString JSONValue]          for NSDictionary personDictionary in listOfPeopleDictionaries               if [loginName isEqualToString[personDictionary  objectForKeyusername]]                   Set the user id                 userId  [personDictionary objectForKeyid]                   Set the users department                 NSArray departmentsArray  [personDictionary objectForKeyorganizations]                 for NSDictionary department in departmentsArray                      [departmentIds addObject[department objectForKeyid]]                                                     else          give error           voiddealloc       Should never be called     [username release]     [userId release]     [departmentIds release]     [super dealloc]  codepre  pThe following code would cause an excbadaccess error on the third line.p  precodeSharedUser user  [SharedUser sharedUser] NSLog, user.username NSLog, user.userId codepre  pThat said, my question is where is the memory behind the userId string being released and what do I do to fix it  Im brand new to stack overflow so please be gentle.p

Negative 136 pWhen I study complex Java codes I didnt write, I regularly write down in notepad the call stacks of some resources I find interesting for a given problem. These resources are generally methods or constants.p  pHeres an example p  precodeCONSTANTNAME     com.company.common.context.business.Context.methodName1         com.company.domain.web.controller.subdomain1.BusinessController.handleRequestHttpServletRequest, HttpServletResponse         com.company.domain.web.controller.subdomain2.BusinessController.handleRequestHttpServletRequest, HttpServletResponse         com.company.domain.web.controller.subdomain3.BusinessController.handleRequestHttpServletRequest, HttpServletResponse     com.company.common.context.business.Context.methodName2         com.company.domain.web.controller.subdomain1.BusinessController.handleRequestHttpServletRequest, HttpServletResponse         com.company.domain.web.controller.subdomain3.BusinessController.handleRequestHttpServletRequest, HttpServletResponse         com.company.domain.web.controller.subdomain2.BusinessController.handleRequestHttpServletRequest, HttpServletResponse     com.company.common.context.business.Context.methodName3Long, boolean         com.company.domain.web.controller.services.ClassName.onSubmitHttpServletRequest, HttpServletResponse, Object, BindException codepre  pFor that purpose, I rightclick in Eclipse on a constantmethod and select References, workspace shortcut CTRLShiftG. In the Search tab, I rightclick on a result and select Copy qualified Name. I then copy it in notepad with a suitable tabulation no tabulation for the first variablemethod and an additional tabulation for each call level. If a method is called by 2 pieces of code, the same tabulation is added for the fully qualified names of the 2 calling methods. The result looks thus a bit like java stacktraces.p  pWhy do I do that  Because I think it gives plenty information on some resources and allows to know in which execution context they are used. Of course, this does not work with configuration resources xml configuration files for example.p  pFor large programs, this manipulation can become cumbersome.p  pIf I use debug mode in Eclipse, I can get an interesting stacktrace when a breakpoint is hit but this is just for a single case and I want more abstraction when I study codes.p  pDo you know if some tools could do that kind of job for me p  pThanks  p  blockquote   pstrongEDIT strong The best way I found to do it is p      ol   limake an open call hierarchy on a constantmethodvariable.li   liexpand all items by using the keyboard arrows in the Call Hierarchy viewli   lirightclick on the root item and choose Copy Expanded Hierarchy.li   ol      pYou then have call stacks you can study in notepadp blockquote

Negative 136 pI am studying Encog versions 3.0 and 3.1 for Java neural network framework and would like to try LevenbergMarquardt algorithm in my neural network training. However my actual neural networks are pretty complex natural featuring hundreds of input neurons and not a single Ive been simplifying from tens of thousands to 136 network appears to be possible to be trained with LevenbergMarquardt saying there is not enough memory while I dedicate 2 GiBs to the JVM. But it performs very good when I try a simple synthetic task with a simple just 3 input neurons network.p  pThe question is how can I estimate the amount of memory it will take Encog to train a particular network with a particular sample set with LevenbergMarquardt algorithm How can I guess what is the maximum complexity can be fit in 2 GiBs the actual machine has 4, but the JVM seems unable to allocate more than 2p

Negative 136 pIve been trying to work with MIDI files for the game that Im making in Java. During the process, I have encountered so many problems, not only because Im new to this stuff but more so because of the bugs with playing audio files on Mac OS X Lion in newly updated Java. Anyway, right now Im working with Sequence, which it works perfectly fine except that its keep getting clipped randomly before it ends. It stops and then continues playing few seconds later. p  pI have also tried working with codeAudioClipcode, which produces a similar result. In fact it was worse with the codeAudioClipcode as it sometimes even changed the instruments randomly, which I have no idea why thats happening Is there stronganystrong way to please get these MIDI files playing without any problem I have been searching and asking a lot for this but I still didnt get an answer to this. p

Negative 136 pI am using ImportXML in a google docs sheet to aqcuire data from the sistrix api. It works fine but I encountered the limitation of 50 ImportXML commands in one sheet. So I used a script that writes the ImportXML command to a cell temporary formula and takes back the resulting value of the cell and copies it to the destination cell. So you can do as much ImportXML queries as you need, as they only appear in one temporary cell in the sheet. The problem here is, that the ImportXML query SOMETIMES takes very long or returns with NA. p  pIs it possible that my script sometimes doesnt wait for the ImportXML query to return and so the result is corrupted I am currently doing it in this wayp  precodefunction GetFormulaDataformula, sheet, row, col    write the formula ImportXML... to the specified cell sheet.getRangerow, col.setFormulaformula   return the value of this cell resulting from the formula return sheet.getRangerow, col.getValue    codepre  pSo this can obviously only work if the formula the ImportXML query is done and has written the return value into the cell, so I can read afterwards.

It is more common to use UrlFetchapp within google doc scripts than ImportXML. But you have to gain the xml data yourself from the http response. This questions can be closed.p

Negative 136 pI am developing an AJAX application and in the process of doing this I am creating many small JS files that will eventually be concatenated and minified in the production release.  However in development I will be working with the individual uniminified files.p  pThe issue I have is that I am using Kate in Ubuntu as my editor and when I make small errors like an extra comma in a JSON structure, or an extra parenthesis, colon, semicolon, or other simple syntax error I have no way of knowing until I see it in Firebug or IE Developer Toolbar run in a VM.  Unfortunately Firebug isnt very good at identifying which line has the syntax error and only IE complains about extra commas.  If I could see these mistakes in realtime like a good modern IDE it would be awesome. However, Ill settle for any syntax checking solution that doesnt require me to copy and paste each file from my local machine into a text area.p  pAlso, JSLint goes a bit overboard with its checking.  Half of the things it complains about I do intentionally.p  pWhat are my optionsp

Negative 136 pMy question is similar to a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions3225223doineedtoprotectthisvariablewithalockthis threada, however I am sure if the conclusion drawn in the given thread applies here.p  pMy use case In the application, there is a status thread which sends out the same texual information after every 1 second. Texual information contains the application group name. This status is used by status reader to determine if application server is onoff.p  pNow application group name can change during its life time. It is ensured that only single thread in the application triggers this event due to some user activity. Now this single thread has the new application group name which I need to update to my status thread.p  pMy current implementation is as followsp  ol lipStatus Thread Main Take ReadLock Read the application group name Release the ReadLockp  psend the statuspli lipUpdater Thread Main Taken write Lock Update the group name Release the WriteLockpli ol  pHowever, due to large number of updates to be sent I fear that I might introduce performance degration for heavy load. So I am working on following implementation, but I am not sure if this would work.p  pNew proposed implementation isp  ol liSender Thread holds char ptr, char[1024] primaryData, char[1024] secondaryData.li liWhen first time application is started, group name is updated in primaryData and ptr points to primaryData.li liWhenever update thread has update event, it will Check if ptr  primaryData     Copy new application name to secondaryData         ptr  secondaryData else     Copy new application name to primaryData.     ptr  primaryDatali liStatus thread will always use data pointed by ptr to send the status. Status Thread will eventually receive updated ptr considering cache coherency and will start transmitting new data.li ol  pFew points to be considered over here. 1. Its ok even if new data is not instantly available to Status thread 2. I dont want program crash due to invalid memory access.p  pFriends, could you please tell me if above logic would help me to avoid readwrite lock.p

Negative 136 pI am not sure if I understand the usage of codecrossdomain.xmlcode correctly. I am, using Uploadify 2.1.4  A flash based file uploader. I have a need to upload files from codeDomain Acode to codeDomain Bcode. Uploadify is hosted and served from codeDomain Acode. To allow the Uploadify flash plugin to communicate and upload to codeDomain Bcode, I must host a codecrossdomain.xmlcode file on codeDomain Bcode. So, if Uploadify finds a codecrossdomain.xmlcode file on codeDomain Bcode that has codeDomain Acode in its whitelist, then the file upload to codeDomain Bcode will be processed. All sounds good until now.p  pHowever, I fail to understand whats preventing an attacker in building a clone uploader on a local website install in his computer and subsequently modifying the codeetchostscode to make the local install use codeDomain Acode as the domain name. Now, the attacker could upload files to codeDomain Bcode, pretending to be codeDomain Acode and codeDomain Bcode would frankly accept the upload as it has codeDomain Acode listed in the whitelist within codecrossdomain.xmlcode.p  pWhats the purpose of codecrossdomain.xmlcode, if it could be easily circumvented like above I could be completely wrong in my understanding of this. An insight would be helpful.p

Negative 136 pI have a working MySQL data warehouse that is organized as a star schema and I am using Talend Open Studio for Data Integration 5.1 to create the ETL process.  I would like this process to run once per day.  I have estimated that one of the dimension tables dimUser will have approximately 2 million records and 23 columns.p  pI created a small test ETL process in Talend that worked, but given the amount of data that may need to be updated daily, the current performance will not cut it.  It takes the ETL process four minutes to UPDATE or INSERT 1,000 records to dimUser.  If I assumed a linear relationship between the count of records and the amount of time to UPDATE or INSERT, then there is no way the ETL can finish in 34 hours my hope, let alone one day.p  pSince Im unfamiliar with Java, I wrote the ETL as a Python script and ran into the same problem.  Although, I did discover that if I did only INSERT, the process went much faster.   I am pretty sure that the bottleneck is caused by the UPDATE statements.p  pThe primary key in dimUser is an autoincrement integer. My friend suggested that I scrap this primary key and replace it with a multifield primary key in my case, 23 fields.p  pBefore I rip the test data out of my warehouse and change the schema, can anyone provide suggestions or guidelines related to p  ol lithe design of the data warehouseli lithe ETL processli lihow realistic it is to have an ETL process INSERT or UPDATE a few million records each dayli liwill my friends suggestion significantly help li ol  pIf you need any further information, just let me know and Ill post it.p  pUPDATE  additional informationp  precodemysqlgt describe dimUser Field                        Type                Null Key Default            Extra userkey                     int10 unsigned    NO   PRI NULL               autoincrement idA                         int10 unsigned    NO       NULL idB                         int10 unsigned    NO       NULL field4                      tinyint4 unsigned NO       0 field5                      varchar50         YES      NULL city                         varchar50         YES      NULL state                        varchar2          YES      NULL country                      varchar50         YES      NULL zipcode                     varchar10         NO       99999 field10                     tinyint1          NO       0 field11                     tinyint1          NO       0 field12                     tinyint1          NO       0 field13                     tinyint1          NO       1 field14                     tinyint1          NO       0 field15                     tinyint1          NO       0 field16                     tinyint1          NO       0 field17                     tinyint1          NO       1 field18                     tinyint1          NO       0 field19                     tinyint1          NO       0 field20                     tinyint1          NO       0 createdate                  datetime            NO       20120101 000000 lastupdate                  datetime            NO       20120101 000000 runid                       int10 unsigned    NO       999 codepre  pI used a surrogate key because I had read that it was good practice.

Negative 136 pI recently started a new project using different carefullychosen technologies, my project is built as follow p  pThe approach is APICentric, which means Im building a website and an iOS app communicating with an API written using codeSymfony2code. Ive successfully managed to write my API, and it is perfectly working.  To gain access to the services provided by the API, the main actors the emwebsite usersem, the emiOS app usersem and the emdevelopersem can authenticate theirself in several ways p  ul lipClients can gain access with a loginpassword couple through the website interface which is communicating directly with the API through AJAX to validate the provided credentials and set a session. So, when someones logs in our website, they have automatically access to the API as well.pli lipDevelopers can authenticate theirself through the API using codeHTTPBasiccode over codeSSLcode, which will as well generate a session and give them access to the services they are authorized to call.pli lipAlso, Developers and clients can gain access to the website and the API using their facebook account through the emFacebook Connectem functionality. This deletes the step where each actor has to create an account on our website.pli ul  pSo basically, the credentials are provided either through codeHTTPBasiccode or using the codeFacebook Logincode functionality.p  pNow that my authentication system is working and that my clients are able to access the website, I would like them to connect to a realtime server when they log in. Like in Facebook or Google if you want where the realtime server manages chat and push informations.p  pIn this case im using codeNode.jscode and the powerfull codesocket.iocode library to manage everything that deals with the realtime side.  Of course, the realtime service will need some credentials to authenticate the user since he is authenticated to the Symfony security system with a session but is not authenticated against the realtime server. p  pA solution Ive been thinking about would be to use the codePdoSessionStoragecode in my API Symfony side and store all the active sessions in a database such as MySQL or PostgreSQL. Doing so, I would be able to send to my realtime server the session id generated by symfony and check on the database if the session id provided is correct or not. If he is Ill let the user access the services provided by my realtime server and associate his session with an identity.  But I really dont know if this is a good solution and I would like some more experienced advices on this and on how to deal with this issue.p  pemNote  For some reasons, I cannot implement codeOAuthcode even if it could be a solution to solve this issue using a Single Sign On approach.emp

Negative 136 pAlthough this has been asked before, by a number of people, this is not the basic install question while the answer may be simple.p  pOK, I am running two install of OpenCV sidebyside 2.3.1 and the latest 2.4 but I primarily use 2.3.1.p  pSo, I have had cvBlob working fine before on the same machine but I came around to doing some reinstall. Anywho, I have build OpenCV successfully and I have made the change from the CvBlob project site to include the a hrefhttpcode.google.compcvblobwikiHowToInstall relnofollowOpenCV library in the CMakeLists.txtap  pTo make sure that OpenCV was fine, I have run and rerun make and make install to ensure it is in the usrlocalinclude directory. Test applications using OpenCV work fine and usingcodefile opencvlibrary.dylibcode shows that the opencv libs are 64 bit.p  pOn to the crux of the problem, I run codecmake .code from the root of the cvblob dir and all comes back fine. codemakecode and then codesudo make installcode is run and I am told that all went well. Again, codefilecode shows that libcvblob is a 64 bit library, although I am not using it.p  pI go to a c program that uses both opencv and cvblob, with absolute paths to opencv.hpp and cvblob.h as includes.p  pThen, thisp  pcodeUndefined symbols for architecture x8664   cvLabel, referenced from       main in cchIl24a.o   cvFilterByArea, referenced from       main in cchIl24a.o ld symbols not found for architecture x8664 collect2 ld returned 1 exit statuscodep  pNot sure what has gone wrong, aside from the obvious, but it should have linked to the opencv libs and I cannot see where I may have gone wrong.

Negative 136 pIt appears that SaveChanges is very slow when saving lots of records, even if the records are of the same type. The image below shows a profiling session of an attempt to save 60000 records, the records are of mixed types, however many of them share the same type. My expectaion was that CreateDbCommandDefinition called by SaveChanges will be called once per records type, surprisingly its being called for each record seperately. This results in bad performance of course. p  pI checked this both with EF 4.3.1 and 5.0, same results. Is there anyway to configure EF in such a way that it doesnt create a command per each records insertedupdated in the dbp

One function returns a c string, which I then convert to a cstring, and the other loads the string, converts the cstring from that and returns it.

Negative 136 pI have a PHPMySQL based web application which has multiple language support by way of a MySQL table languagestrings with stringid, langid, langtext fields.

Negative 136 pIm currently working on implementing a Dropbox OAuth client for my application. Its been a fairly painless process until I hit the end. Once Ive authorized, when I attempt to access user data I get a 401 back from Dropbox about the token being invalid. I asked on the Dropbox forums and it looks like my request is missing the accesstokensecret that Dropbox returns back. I was able to use Fiddler to dig out the secret and add it to my request url and it worked fine, so thats definitely the issue. So why doesnt DotNetOpenAuth return back the access token secret when it returns the access tokenp  pFor reference, my codep  pre classlangcs prettyprintoverridecodepublic class DropboxClient  OAuthClient      public static readonly ServiceProviderDescription DropboxServiceDescription  new ServiceProviderDescription              RequestTokenEndpoint  new MessageReceivingEndpointhttpsapi.dropbox.com1oauthrequesttoken, HttpDeliveryMethods.GetRequest  HttpDeliveryMethods.AuthorizationHeaderRequest,         UserAuthorizationEndpoint  new MessageReceivingEndpointhttpswww.dropbox.com1oauthauthorize, HttpDeliveryMethods.GetRequest  HttpDeliveryMethods.AuthorizationHeaderRequest,         AccessTokenEndpoint  new MessageReceivingEndpointhttpsapi.dropbox.com1oauthaccesstoken, HttpDeliveryMethods.GetRequest  HttpDeliveryMethods.AuthorizationHeaderRequest,         TamperProtectionElements  new ITamperProtectionChannelBindingElement[]  new PlaintextSigningBindingElement            public DropboxClientstring consumerKey, string consumerSecret           thisconsumerKey, consumerSecret, new AuthenticationOnlyCookieOAuthTokenManager                public DropboxClientstring consumerKey, string consumerSecret, IOAuthTokenManager tokenManager           basedropbox, DropboxServiceDescription, new SimpleConsumerTokenManagerconsumerKey, consumerSecret, tokenManager                protected override DotNetOpenAuth.AspNet.AuthenticationResult VerifyAuthenticationCoreDotNetOpenAuth.OAuth.Messages.AuthorizedTokenResponse response                          var profileEndpoint  new MessageReceivingEndpointhttpsapi.dropbox.com1accountinfo, HttpDeliveryMethods.GetRequest         HttpWebRequest request  this.WebWorker.PrepareAuthorizedRequestprofileEndpoint, response.AccessToken          try                      using WebResponse profileResponse  request.GetResponse                              using Stream profileResponseStream  profileResponse.GetResponseStream                                      using StreamReader reader  new StreamReaderprofileResponseStream                                              string jsonText  reader.ReadToEnd                         JavaScriptSerializer jss  new JavaScriptSerializer                         dynamic jsonData  jss.DeserializeObjectjsonText                         Dictionaryltstring, stringgt extraData  new Dictionaryltstring, stringgt                         extraData.AdddisplayName, jsonData.displayname  Unknown                         extraData.AdduserId, jsonData.uid  Unknown                         return new DotNetOpenAuth.AspNet.AuthenticationResulttrue, ProviderName, extraData[userId], extraData[displayName], extraData                                                                     catch WebException ex                      using Stream s  ex.Response.GetResponseStream                              using StreamReader sr  new StreamReaders                                      string body  sr.ReadToEnd                     return new DotNetOpenAuth.AspNet.AuthenticationResultnew Exceptionbody, ex                                              codepre

Negative 136 pI was reading an article on solving the problem of codeLongest Common Subsequencecode at a hrefhttpwww.geeksforgeeks.orgarchives12998 relnofollowgeekforgeeksa, where there are two solutions, one recursive, and another through DP by a 2D array. The DP solution does it in codeONMcode time, while the recursive one does it in codeO2Ncode time.p  pThe main problem with the recursive solution is the occurrence of overlapping of subsequences, as given there. however, if I store each pair in a hash, so that the next time that value is required by a recursion of the function, it can directly fetch the value from the hash instead of recursing further. So how much will this addition improve the efficiency Will it come to codeONMcodep  pAnd secondly, how come the recursive solution yields codeO2Ncode time How to find out the complexity of recursive functions like this one, or the one to find Fibonacci sequence, etcp

Negative 136 pIm in the process of updating my AUTOINCREMENT PRIMARY KEY ID columns from INT to BIGINT. Im using MySQL version 5.0.82 with InnoDB tables.

But my question is, does MySQL update this key to be applicable for BIGINTs, or does it maintain only INT capabilitiesp  pI looked through the MySQL reference guide for ALTER TABLE, and I found mention that if the size of a column is decreased to less than an indexs length then the index will be shortened, but I couldnt find anything indicating what would happen to an index if the underlying column grows in size. Id like to know if I should be dropping and recreating the indexes, too, or if MySQL will do what Im hoping.p

Negative 136 pI have an ASP.NET Controller, that has a function, that simply returns a ContentResult of a WebClient.p  pIn this case, CNN is my testbed, my WebClient, downloads CNN as a string, into its content, and returns the result as an ActionResultContentResult on a controller.p  pIm calling a RenderPartial on this action, to get CNN to display below and to the right of my current content, in its own box.p  pThe problem Im running into, is when you click a link on CNN, it redirects to a relative url sometimes, and that relative url, doesnt exist in my localhost, and wont exist on my web server, thus the link fails.p  pWhen it does redirect to an absolute url, thats also a problem, as the resulting page replaces my .NET shell.p  pWhat I need it to do, is take any URLs that are inside that ContentResult I returned, and if any of those URLs are clicked, pass them back to my .NET application, to be downloaded by the WebClient, and rendered back in that shell.p  pIm aware I could use an IFRAME to do this instead of WebClient, but an IFRAME is impossible in my case, as its restricted by the public API were consuming, its restrictedhas flaws in the framework that API is servicing, and its blocked on some of our client machines, which we have no control over.p  pAlso, the client machines will be off our network, so I cant use an AJAX load, as thatd be XSS.p  pOne idea that I can think of, is basically to create custom routes, with filtersrules, that look for CNN like links, and pass them to my controller, as a parameter then have my controller render my page, and pass those links to the web client.p  pThis would obviously be a lot of work, and not even really sure where to start with it in the routing engine.p  pThe only other thing I can think of that might work, is checking the validity of the URL, by attempting to see if it points to a valid link. If it doesnt point to a valid link, adding CNNs url prefix to it, and seeing if that is then a valid link. But that seems like a lot of work, for a solution that would be a heavy hit on performance, as checking each link on a page like CNN, could be very costly. Also, since Id be running each link twice, thatd be a problem where POST operations were required, as itd essentially run each operation twice, and being that this is a public API Im consuming off a public framework, I wouldnt have control of the source code to safeguard against that.p  pAny other suggestions Is there any way to accomplish what Im trying to do easilyp

Negative 136 pFor the past year or so Ive been familiarizing myself with Javascript, and in an attempt to really learn the language thoroughly I decided to make an HTML5 game The problem ive run into is that I have absolutely no idea how to move an image across the screen smoothly, and at an angle. I could move it at a forty five degree angle by moving it one pixel updown the x axis and one pixel updown the y axis, but thats just not specific enough. How would I go about moving it at a very specific angle It seems to me that there would have to be a function that rounds it to the nearest pixel p  pNot exactly sure...

I even applied the same settings in Ubuntu and got rid of Ubuntu think It may be an issue with dual boot and still wont work. Tried both WAN IP and DDNS as well. I also heard some PC work with WOL only when it sleeps or hibernates so I spent another hour or so trying to make the Sever to go to sleep but it wont support sleep. p  pWell, WAKE ON LAN WOL just doesnt work for whatever reason. One thing I noticed was the MAC address I get in the O.S is one letter different last digit then the MAC address I got in BMC BASEBOARD MANAGEMENT CONTROLLER I have tried both MAC, and tons of different ports try to wake the PC up but still no luck. INeed help...My major concern is why MAC in the O.S is one digit different than the one in BMC setting like regular bios setting for WOL xxxxxxxxxxxa and xxxxxxxxxxxb..thats weird p

My first instinct is thisp  pcodepopulation [individualvocab for N in rangeN]codep  pBut of course, the problem is that this isnt dynamic all the individuals in the population in this case are a direct copy of one another i.e., point to individualvocab and therefore wont change independently, such that if I do this with an N of 3, then try to assign a new value to the word ending of the first word of the first individual, I get this where the ones are e and the 2s are t, which changes the ending of the first word for every individualp  blockquote   blockquote     blockquote       ppopulation[0][0][0]  new endingp              ppopulationp     blockquote   blockquote blockquote  pcode[[[new ending, 2], [1, 2], [1, 2], [1, 2], [1, 2]], [[new ending, 2], [1, 2], [1, 2], [1, 2], [1, 2]], [[new ending, 2], [1, 2], [1, 2], [1, 2], [1, 2]]]codep  phow can I efficiently make a dynamic list of lists of listsp

Negative 136 pI hope this hasnt been asked too much before. When I search I only get questions pertaining to rescaling to window size.p  pNow my question. I got one space ship firing a beam against another ship. I want the beam to show for some time and I want it to bridge the two ships. In other words, I want the beam to extend its width between the two ships.p  pI try to do this with a dot movie clip that is 1 pixel wide and high and aligned left edge.

Negative 136 pim creating a statebased game using slick 2d, and lwjgl. I currently am using if statements to check whether the mouse is inside the area of the button, and another if statement to check whether the mouse button is down the button is just a picture g.drawImagebuttonImage.png, x,y .

Negative 136 pHow can I create a procedure that inserts a record into a table by a sort order ranking column and moves the rest down. For example, my sp receives the input of PhysIDFK, UserIDFK,UserRoleIDFK, which have a constraint that they must be a unique combination, and the last input, SortOrder which determines where the combination is inserted within the table and every record after that sort order moves down or adds 1 to the sort order to make room for the inserted row.p  pThere are three roleid options per physid.

The article talks about generational GC, deallocation, threadlocal allocation and escape analysis.p  pHowever, I just had a little voice in my head ask me, But is this true of the garbage collector implementation in Android and I dont know the answer. I wouldnt even know how to go about finding the answer.p  pI remember having the GC run less often in my android apps when I implemented pooling for small objects that were used often, though. Not sure if that means a faster app.. Also, GC ran more often without pooling according to logcat, so I assume Androids implementation of the GC loses to pooling.. But this assumption has very little backing because I didnt notice any significant performance difference with or without pooling.p  pSo.. Anyone here know if pooling is more efficient than Androids GC for small objects used oftenp

Of course, there is no output to codestdcoutcode and codestaticcastcode is used instead of codestdmovecode, so that they are valid codeconstexprcode definitions. And since in emC11em codeconstexprcode still implies codeconstcode, the overload commented out in the sample code cannot be provided as it would redefine the constqualified rvalue overload.p

Negative 136 pI am using PhlyRestfully to develop a web based API that has the business logicServices, Entities... in other module. In order to do that Ive created a module named Api that has configured the PhlyRestfully to use the hydrator codeClassMethodscode. The issue is that my entity has a lot for proprieties and the api response is reflecting the entity and I dont want that.p  pFor example  my entity has the proprieties p  precodeclass Deal     dealid    title    description    price  codepre  pThe fetch method created in ModelService is returning a Deal but it selects only the title and dealid because these are only columns that I want to display in the response. The response doesnt have only the title and dealid as I wanted but is reflecting the hole entity. If Im not specifying the hydrator in the config the response is how I wanted wih  title and dealid but there is another problem in response, the key has an additional textu0000u0000.From what I saw in the code the additional text is added because of the cast and a hydrator is necessary.p  pThere is any solution to resolve this problem without build a separate logic in the Api module Can someone suggest me any other solutions p  pbr strongResourcestrongbrp  precodenamespace ApiResources  class Deals extends AbstractListenerAggregate       protected listeners  array      protected table

Negative 136 pSo I have an X window that belongs to another process, and I want to trigger a resize event for that window, preferably without actually resizing it.p  pMy first approach was to just resize the window twice, going back to the original size the second time, but I failed. The problem is that the window in question is displayed fullscreen, and apparently calling codeXResizeWindowcode or codeXMoveResizeWindowcode on these does nothing which makes sense in some way. It works fine if the window is not in fullscreen mode.br  As this was only for quick testing anyways I started wondering if it is possible to fakeinject a resize event for that window in the X server. For MS Windows that seems quite easy, found a lot of examples while googling, but for X it seems Im out of luck.p  pBackground as people will probably ask anyways  Im launching a VMware Player instance in fullscreen, and in some cases after bootup, the Windows guest doesnt change its resolution according to the host but it mostly does, thanks to the VMware Tools being installed on the guest. The VM is used on several machines having differently sized screens connected, so I cant preconfigure the image to have the correct resolution. Currently the users are told to exit and reenter fullscreen if the resolution is wrong, but that is pretty inconvenient. So my idea was to simply tell the VMplayer that it just got resized after bootup, but maybe there is a better approach at all...p

Negative 136 pIm compiling a SWIG wrapped C library into a python module, that should ideally be distributable for individuals to use the library transparently like a module. Im building the library using cmake and swig on OSX 10.8.2 System framework  Apple python2.7.2, Installed framework  python.org python 2.7.5p  pThe trouble Im running into is that after linking with the framework, the compiled library is emveryem selective of the version of python that is being run, even though codeotool Lcode shows that it is compiled with compatability version 2.7.0. It appears that the different distributions have slightly different linker symbols and stuff starts to breakp  pThe most common problem is that it crashes the python kernel with a codeFatal Python error PyThreadStateGet no current threadcode according to a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions15678153homebrewpythononmacosx108fatalpythonerrorpythreadstategetnocuthis questiona, indicative of a linking incompatability. I can get my library to work in the python it was compiled against. p  pUnfortunately this library is for use in a academic laboratory, with computers of all different ages and operating systems, many of them in permanent deprecation in order to run proprietary software that hasnt been updated in years, and I certainly dont have time to play I.T. and fix all of them, currently Ive just been compiling against the version of python that comes with the latest Enthought distribution since most computers can get that in one way or another . A lot of the researchers I work with use some python IDE specific to their field that comes with an interpreter built in, but is not modifiable and not a Framework build so I cant build against it, for the time being, they can run their experiment scripts in Enthought as a stopgap, but its not ideal. Even when I link against the python.org distribution that is the same version as the builtin IDE python 2.7.2 I think, it even has the same damn release number, it still breaks the same way. p  pIn any case, the question is, is there any way to link a SWIG wrapped python library so that it will run at least on OSX regardless of what interpreter is importing it given certain minimum conditions, like guaranteed to be 2.7.0.p  pstrongEDITstrongp  pCompiling against canopypython installed version with the following linker flags in cmakep  pcodeset CMAKESHAREDLINKERFLAGS L LibraryEnthoughtCanopy32bitUserlib ldl framework CoreFoundation lpython2.7 u PyMacError LibraryEnthoughtC anopy32bitUserlibcodep  pThis results in an rpath symbol path when examining the linked library with codeotoolcode, seems to work fine with enthoughtcanopy on other OSX systems, the codelpythoncode seems to be optional, it adds an additional python symbol in the library reference to the osx python not system pythonp  pCompiling against system python with the following linker flagsp  pcodeset CMAKESHAREDLINKERFLAGS L LibraryFrameworksPython.frameworkVersionsCurrentlibpython2.7config ldl framework CoreFoundation  u PyMacError LibraryFrameworksPython.frameworkVersionsCurrentPythoncodep  pWorks in enthought and system pythonp  pNeither of these work with the bundled python with a hrefhttpwww.psychopy.org relnofollowpsychopya, which is the target environment, compiling against the bundled python works with psychopy but no other python.p

Negative 136 pSo this stems from a problem yesterday that quickly spiraled out of control as the errors were unusual. This problem still exists but the question was put on hold, a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions17903067indexundefinedwhenreceivingpostfromjqueryherea, and I was asked to reform a new question that now relates to the current problem. So here we go.p  pThe problem is basic in nature. If you were helping yesterday I have switched from a .post to an .ajax post to deliver a variable to my codePHPcode file. However my codePHPcode file seems to never receive this variable stating that the index is undefined. p  pNow this would normally mean that the variable holds no value, is named incorrectly, or was sent incorrectly. Well after a full day of messing with this kill me I still see no reason my codePHPcode file should not be receiving this data.

Negative 136 pWhile analyzing  the HTTP Requests OF a website. I found that in one of the POST request it sends three postdata to  the server the first one was SAML data first base64 encoded then urlencoded. But I am not able to figure out the value of other two postvars. One thing I am sure about is that it is not using any encryption methods like md5 or sha1 etc. COZ the response text contains my user name value which according to my research is neither stored in session variable or cookies means this encoding of post data can be reversed. So I am guessing that may be my  user name RAHUL is  inside one of these post variables.

Negative 136 pUsing Adobe Flash CS6 Exporting Flash player 11.2 OS OSXWindowsp  pHeya guys. Ive been having this huge issue for a while now. Im working on an educational game. This main SWF loads several other SWFs. Since its a bilingual game, each activity has two versions, the spanish and the english one. p  pNow to the main concern. Lets say I have this activity called hangman. I have the hangman.swf which is the spanish version and the hangmanE.swf which is the english one. Theyre virtually the same except for the actual assets used. Both are loaded by a master SWF. So in their libraries I have a sound which has a class called AudioInstruction, which is the activitys instruction. The actual file is different since I need one for each language, but the class given is the same.p  pstrongFile mapstrongp  ul liMaster.swf ul liHangman.swfli liHangmanE.swfli ulli ul  pThe problem comes when I open the spanish version and then I switch to the english one or vise versa. Since the english one was opened second, it actually ignores its internal AudioInstruction file and just plays the spanish one. strongAs if having an asset with the same class name makes the second SWF ignore its own assets. Has anyone encountered this problemstrong p  pIt can happen with any type of asset MovieClip, Sound or Graphic. I thought it was because of in frame coding, but I made them class based and they still have this issue. This isnt exclusive to any OS, it happens in both Windows and Mac OSX.p
Negative 136 pI was hoping for a way to comment out code on release versions.p  pWhat led me to Ant was that strongProguards way of removing Log.Dstrong debug calls was unsatisfactory as it was leaving the string literals in the dex files, even though the Log.D code was being removed by its optimisation technique. As pointed out on this thread a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions6009078removingunusedstringsduringproguardoptimisationRemoving unused strings during ProGuard optimisationap  pThere someone one has suggested Ant could be used with a replace algorithm but this wipes out the code when it is run. I was hoping if there was a way of commenting out the code so it became strongant Log.dstrong, then once it compiles the strongantstrong could be removed.p  pI am new to ant, and I wasnt able to find any search results for commenting out code in Ant. Is it not a recommended practice I feel copying all the files to another directory and then removing the lines and then copying it back is overkill. If the compile fails you are left with your code in another directory.p  pSo at the moment I am using the below regex pattern to comment out the code. p  precode ltregexp patternsLog.ds.sgt         ltsubstitution expression1AntComment Log.d2gt codepre  pI was wondering if there is a better way i.e. a built in way of handling comments.  p  pAlso is there a way trial run ant regex statements to see what it picks upp  pListening to strongJean Waghettistrong i tried a few bits of code with strongconditional compilationstrongp  pI just tried a few variations, it seems it needs you to have ifDEBUG in the same function. So this piece of code will end up having the string literal in the classes.dex file.p  precodeLogger.myLogSensitive Info  c  you call this  in Logger class  myLog method static void myLogString msg ifDEBUG codepre  pIf you try to have a bit more sophisticated logging, where it needs figure out whether to log but with an and ampamp with DEBUG it ends up adding the string literal in the dex file eg p  precodepublic class SomeClass   public final boolean log  DEBUG ampamp figureLog   private boolean figureLog     some condition based on other settings     in the code   if log codepre  pTo achieve a more sophisticated logging you have to have thisp  precodeifDEBUG ampamp log  codepre  pbefore all logging calls, it creates too many unused code warnings and looks ugly for me.  p

Negative 136 pIm currently trying to polish my application and improve its performance. Basically, its an advanced Graph class. It draws a few lines and refreshes them.p  pAfter fixing a few slow points, I wanted to benchmark my result. My drawing was stuck at 65 FPS which is perfect but Im benchmarking. I Invalidate my object in a timer set to 1 ms and redraw my stuff using the protected override void OnPaint way.p  pAfter that, I put the Invalidate into the protected override void OnPaint. The FPS was set to a few thousand afterwards. But using that method will result in an empty screen.p  pMy question is Is that issue done on purpose That would make sense as anything higher than your screen refreshrate is wasted power.

Negative 136 pIm having such a frustrating time figuring this out. Im making a loginregistration function for an iOS app thats working fine on my local server. I want to import it to an actual server but I have been having very little success. I included sample code at the end of this for reference.p  pI set up an EC2 instance and made sure to open port 3306 in the security group a hrefhttpec254215166236.uswest1.compute.amazonaws.comsg.png relnofollowseen herea. The problem Im having is when I try to make the initial connection to the instance via the app. When I connect to codehttp54.215.166.236code in API.m my instances elastic IP I do not get a successful connection. By that I mean, the failure block on this method gets calledp  pcode[operation setCompletionBlockWithSuccess  failure ]codep  pHowever, the php files do get run before the successfailure determination and this is what I see in the apache error logsp  blockquote   pmysqliconnect HY0001130 Host 54.215.166.236 is not allowed   to connect to this MySQL server in varwwwhtmlphplib.php on line 6p blockquote  pAnd thats when Im accessing the MySQL db viap  precodelink  mysqliconnect54.215.166.236,user,password mysqliselectdblink, db codepre  pBut when I change the address to include the 3306 port I get...p  precodelink  mysqliconnect54.215.166.2363306,user,password mysqliselectdblink, db codepre  blockquote   pmysqliconnect HY0002005 Unknown MySQL server host   54.215.166.2363306 0 in varwwwhtmlphplib.php on line 6p blockquote  pAgain, this is all when I try to make the initial instance connection with the address codehttp54.215.166.236code. Therefore, this tells me that Im successfully connecting to the EC2 instance, but Im not connecting to the MySQL database which is why I get sent to the codefailurecode block  p  pWhen I go back and change that initial connection address in API.m to codehttp54.215.166.2363306code, the connection proceeds to the codesetCompletionBlockWithSuccesscode block, however I get no log output from apache, php, or mysql and no entries in the server database. Its as if the php files arent being executed. In fact, this is probably exactly whats happening, because when I try and go to run php files like codehttp54.215.166.2363306index.phpcode, my browser attempts to download the php file, rather than executing it. This is why Im so confused. If theres no attempt at even logging into the MySQL database because no log output and no successful input of data in the db, why does adding 3306 port on initial connection give me a successful connectionp  pIm at such a loss here.

Negative 136 pi have an issue with a fix i made to allow a flood filled object be printed...p  pso, the full story is we were using the windows GDI FloodFill function, which we noticed doesnt work on printers, so what i found on the inet, was to create a memory DC, compatible with the printer DC, and make all my drawing operations on the memory DC, and then BitBlt it all at once to the printer DC i had to change to use a recursive, color replacment flood fill function too, since the memory DC only allows what the main DC didp  pthe problem is the memory DC seems to be a pixel or two bigger on the x and y, but i dont know what to do, when i get the selected bitmap from the memory DC, it shows it to be the correct size, i would like to use StretchBlt, but the values i have access to use as params for StretchBlt, make it no different than calling BitBltp  plet me know if you need more info...p  pthanks in advancep  pheres my codep  precodeHDC hMemPrnDC  CreateCompatibleDC hPrnDC HBITMAP hBitmap  CreateCompatibleBitmap hPrnDC, iWidthLP, iHeightLP HBITMAP hOldBitmap  SelectBitmap hMemPrnDC, hBitmap       paint the whole memory DC with the window color HBRUSH hBrush  CreateSolidBrush GetSysColor COLORWINDOW RECT rect      add one to right and bottom, FillRect doesnt include the right and bottom edges SetRect amprect, 0, 0, iWidthLP  1, iHeightLP  1      NOTE im doing this cause it starts out as all black FillRect hMemPrnDC, amprect, hBrush       delete object DeleteBrush hBrush    do all my MoveToEx, LineTo, Ellipse, Arc, TextOut,  SetPixel, etc calls on hMemPrnDC here        copy all the memory DC drawing data to the printer DC BitBlt hPrnDC, 0, 0, iWidthLP, iHeightLP, hMemPrnDC, 0, 0, SRCCOPY       select old bitmap, and clean up objects SelectBitmap hMemPrnDC, hOldBitmap DeleteBitmap hBitmap DeleteDC hMemPrnDC hMemPrnDC  NULL codepre  pUPDATE Sept 5p  phere is a link to a PDF print where I draw straight to the printer DC a hrefhttpwww.winsim.comstackoverflowhPrnDC.pdf relnofollowhPrnDC.pdfap  pand here is the same but I draw to the memory DC then BitBlt it to the printer DC a hrefhttpwww.winsim.comstackoverflowhMemPrnDC.pdf relnofollowhMemPrnDC.pdfap  pnow, I did enable my recursive flood fill function on the second, to show an example of what we are trying to achieve, it does the same without it, so that is not an issuep  pas you can see, the bottom and right edge are cut off, Im also concerned about the differences in font amp line weight between the two, but not as much as the sizing mismatchp  pNOTE the filename printed at the top doesnt go through the memory DC, that is always drawn straight to the printer DCp

Negative 136 pI have an application that is used to manage customer loyalty points for a supermarket. We have a database that supports our internal call centre application which has operated for about 10 years or so, but more recently we have also exposed a web services layer direct to the database to support a public website, where customers can log in and updated their details directly. The web site is maintained by a third party, which makes changes a little more complicated.p  pNow, the problem is that there are a few nightly batch jobs which can take hours to run and lock the database for long periods of time. I have been tasked with making sure that the web services arent affected by these batch jobs.

First, codegetAllIconsOfOldCategoryint oldCategorycode and second  codegetIconint deviceId, int unitenumber, int status, int oldCategorycode. In application, where I am using first metod, everything works....but when I try to use second method, application throws NullPointerException before codegetIconcode method start executing and application is Forced closed. p  pSo, below I will provide the class, where I use this Databashandler class and its methods. Here is, lets call it classA.java. So, classA this extends to another classis used to render listView and every individual line of listView. [ImageView][Text][SwitchButton]this is one line in listView. Here Ive got codeonCreatecode method I think its nothing wrong with this method, because it doesnt show any error and it works when I press on imageViewyou will see more explanation below.p  precodeprivate DatabaseHandler db  public void onCreateBundle savedInstanceState      super.onCreatesavedInstanceState     db  new DatabaseHandlerclassA.this             .getParent   codepre  pSo, in this class, there is methos coderenderDevicecode which is used to render all lines in listview, and it return view. And my goal is, to check, if there is image in database, show this one, and if there is not, than show pre defined one. But, it doesnt work... Its all right till the line, where I call codedb.getIconcode method. Then it show the error. And the method dont even start executing.p  precodeImageView devicestatusimage  ImageView lightView                 .findViewByIdR.id.devicestatusimage         Settings settings  Settings.getInstance           String icon  db.getIconlight.id, settings.getLastPkAccessPoint, status, light.oldCategory          if  icon  null              int resId  getResources.getIdentifiericon, drawable,                     getPackageName             devicestatusimage.setImageResourceresId          else             devicestatusimage.setImageResourceR.drawable.normalicon            codepre  pBut, moreover, Ive got codeonClickListenercode on codedevicestatusimagecode. And here works everything... So, it open up a dialog. That means that codeClassA.this.getParentcode is good and it works. And you can see, I call codedb.getAllIconsOfOldCategorycode  where I set new adapter. p  precodedevicestatusimage.setOnClickListenernew OnClickListener           public void onClickView v              final Dialog dialog  new DialogClassA.this                     .getParent             dialog.setContentViewR.layout.listviewicon             listView  ListView dialog.findViewByIdR.id.listview              IconAdapter adapter  new IconAdapterinflater, light.id,                     light.oldCategory, light.name, db                             .getAllIconsOfOldCategorylight.oldCategory                  listView.setAdapteradapter             dialog.show              Button bCancel  Button dialog.findViewByIdR.id.bCancel             bCancel.setOnClickListenernew OnClickListener                   public void onClickView v                      dialog.dismiss                                               codepre  pSo, I tried to add codeString icon  db.getIconlight.id, settings.getLastPkAccessPoint, status, light.oldCategorycode into OnClickListener, just to check if here the method execute I check this with debugging and it worked, the method codegetIconcode executed... But, when I put it back to the place where it need to be. Surprise, surprise, it dont work any more..p  pAnd, here is log file, if it will help you.

Negative 136 pI thought you guys might be able to help me wrap my head around this. I want to be able to generate rects and assign images to those rects. Ive been doing this for the whole project and isnt too hard. The hard part here is that I want this particular function to be able to generate as many different rects as I want. The project is a game that takes place on like a chess board. I figure I can write like... if statements for every single space and then have like a bazillion parameters in the function that dictate which rects get generated and where, but I was hoping someone might be able to think of a more elegant solution. p

Negative 136 pIm debugging a program written by a customer to interface with some hardware my company manufactures using a simple API we supply.    The customer program is a .Net C program using Winforms and its very simple a Form, a Button and a TextBox because they were just testing their ability to access our API.p  pOn a 32 bit XP system it runs fine and exits cleanly when I click the X in the top right corner of the Form.p  pOn a 64 bit Win 7 system it runs fine but clicking the X only closes the Form it doesnt kill the process.  Furthermore, Task Manager wont kill the process, and puts up no message saying why.   And even in the CommandPrompt window, run as Administrator, when I try to kill it with TaskKill it says, This process can only be terminated forcefully with a F option.  So I do that and it says SUCCESS.  The process with PID 7468 has been terminated.p  pstrongExcept that it hasnt.strong  Both Task Manager and Process Explorer still show it running.

Negative 136 pIm a coach of a middle school Lego Robotics team, competing in our local FIRST Lego League competition. Im interested in bringing Agile methodologies to our team. From what Ive been seeing, it seems like a good fit, and would really help teach the students how things work in real world software engineering. The problem is that Im a bit shaky on some aspects of adapting Agile to a softwarehardware problem.p  pHeres what I have so farp  ul liIn the competition, the robot is set up on a table with many Lego structures. These make up missions worth varying number of points. The robot leaves a Base area, does something ideally one or more missions and returns. This sounds a lot like a user story, and Im already planning to get the students to write what they want the robot to do that way. All the missions basically become the backlogli liIm also going to use Planning Poker to estimate how hard theyll be to build and program for. Our team only meets for 1 hour per week, though. What would be the best way to set up the time estimates Im thinking that the smallest unit should be 12 an hour, and would go up from there.li liThese missions tend to be pretty complex sometimes, and benefit from being broken down into simpler tasks. Should we worry about that when writing up user stories Doesnt seem so...li liAs coach, should I act as project owner Or should a student on the team be tasked with determining which missions or combination of missions is most importantli liGiven that our team is small 8 students, would one Scrum Master be bestli liGiven that our team is small, is it fine for students to be testers and developers as needed Id like to avoid giving them excuses for downtime.li liSince we only meet 1 hour per week, would a sprint length of 1 month be bestli liIve also been looking at the concept of testfirst design, and while it seems great, I dont understand the terminology. How would I get my students to design the robot and its programs test first Would it even be appropriateli ul  pI know these are a lot of questions.

Negative 136 pI am new to JS and it has been a bear for me to learn. I am working to build a responsive site using media queries. I want a clickable slideshow that changes the main photo when you click one of the three thumbnails.p  pI have decided to keep the slideshow simple. I have a div with a main image and three thumbnails underneath. When I click a thumbnail I want the codemainPhotocode div class to change to a different class with a different codebackgroundimagecode. I am using the jquery code.onclick,code function and code.addClasscode to change the div class when one of the thumbnails are clicked. I am doing this because I am going to use media queries. If the screen is smaller or larger the div classes I am calling will have a different background image to fit the larger or smaller window. I have not added the codemediacode code yet. But eventually I will have different backgroundimages for each class depending on certain screen sizes.p  pRight now I just want to keep it simple and create the script that works first. My problem is that when I click the thumbnails it only works once and it only works in order meaning if I click codethumbnailThreecode before codethumbnailTwocode I cannot click the others. I want to be able to click all three as money times as I want. Maybe there is an easier way to do this, but I am new to JS and jQuery.

Negative 136 pI just switched some NUnit test projects from x86 to AnyCPU and started to run them in 64bit runtime using nunitconsole.exe instead of nunitconsolex86.exe. This resulted in some 50100 longer test duration to my great surprise. I can easily simulate it repeatedly on any of the test assemblies and even profiled the test runs, but Im not able to figure out whats causing the performance penalty, because just everything seems to perform slower in 64bits. I also tried to run the tests on few different machines with same results.p  pTest assemblies are using Spring.NET IOC and Oracle ODP managed provider this was the reason behind switching tests from x86 to AnyCPU to perform integration tests. The only difference in test runs is really the 32 vs 64bit environment or nunit executable nunitconsolex86.exe vs nunitconsole.exe respectively.p  pIs there any general reason for such a big test duration difference Or does anyone have an idea what should I check to find out the cause of the issuep  hr  pFollow upp  pThe problem is caused by Oracle ODP.NET Managed Driver released this august version 121010 or 4.121.1.0. It apparently has a hrefhttpsforums.oracle.comcommunitydeveloperenglishoracledatabasewindowsand.netodp.netcontentfilterIDcontentstatus5Bpublished5Dobjecttypeobjecttype5Bthread5D relnofollowmany performance issuesa and one of them is 64bit performance penalty.

Negative 136 pNote this is for a school assignment, so although there are definitely more effective ways to solve the problem Im facing, it needs to be done in a particular fashion.p  pIve created a form on Access titled Newborn Disease Risk Calculator.

Negative 136 pWith Ember, you can find a number of tutorials on building blogs and to do lists, but there doesnt seem to be much on anything that requires more complex models. Im looking for a little more guidance as to whether or not there are best practices for dealing with complex normalized data in Ember.p  pFor instance, Im working on a wine cellar app, and Im using 8 different tables to model bottles of wine though the details arent really importantp  precodewines categories bottlevarietals winevarietals producers appellations regions countries codepre  pIn order to display the wine bottles, I will need to join all of this data. I see two ways of doing thatp  ol liDo a join on the server side, and send a package of wine bottles to the client where youd only have a codewinebottlecode model.li liCreate 8 Ember models that correspond to each table, and create Ember relationships with codehasManycode, codebelongsTocode, etc.li ol  pBoth ways seem feasible and like they would have their advantages and disadvantages. Given that Ember is an opinionated framework, is there an Ember Way on this one, or does this just come down to developer tastesp

Negative 136 pI have an application that reads from a text file that is being simultaneously written to by another application. The application that reads the file opens it in text mode using C  fopen. The lines in the file can be big, like up to a few 100 megs in size. For this reason we have a function that reads chunks of 4K from the file using fgets and appends it in a string object until it manages to read a complete line. It is possible that the application which is writing into the file has written a partial line when a read attempt was made. Out custom ReadLine function handles this scenario by detecting endoffile, resetting the file pointer to last known good position, and discarding the text thats been read already. p  pHeres how that function looks likep  precodedefine MAXBUFSIZE 4096  bool ReadLineFILE fp, stdstringamp result, boolamp isEof       result.clear     long const lastOffset  ftellfp     bool hasReadOneLine  false     isEof  false      debugprintlastOffset      while hasReadOneLine ampamp isEof           char dataRead[MAXBUFSIZE]         memsetdataRead, 0, sizeofdataRead          if fgetsdataRead, MAXBUFSIZE, fp  NULL               if feoffp                  debugprintFlag 1                 isEof  true              else                  debugprintFlag 2                 result.clear                 fseekfp, lastOffset, SEEKSET reset the file pointer to where it was                 return false                                 result  dataRead         hasReadOneLine  result[result.length1]  n        end loop      if hasReadOneLine          debugprintFlag 3         result.clear         fseekfp, lastOffset, SEEKSET reset the file pointer to where it was         return false            drop the newline character ...     if result[ result.length1]  n          result.resizeresult.size  1           return true   codepre  pProblem  I have run into a scenario where after reading a full line from the file, the ReadLine function is returning the last chunk from the previously read line when it is called again to read the next line. I logged the value of lastOffset returned by the ftell and noticed that in that rare scenario the fgets has not moved the file pointer to the end of the line which it read. p  pI added some debug lines but in my case only thing that got printed was the lastOffset value.p  pIn the call where the ReadLine returned an incomplete line, the value of lastOffset is 21563617 Length of the incomplete line is 920p  pIn the call before where it returned a complete line, the value of lastOffset is 21442207 Length of the line read in this previous call is 122331 including newlinep  pMy question is has anyone ever encountered similar problem What is your opinion about what could be potentially going wrong I am not necessarily looking for a complete answer but just some pointers about what could potentially go wrong.p  p UPDATE p  pI managed to reproduce the problem with a small utility, writing in a file in chunks of 4K and with a sleep interval of 10 ms, while the other program that uses the function above reading from the same file simultaneously. p  pLooks like doing fseek to reset the filepointer is a bad option in the function above as resetting the filepointer to a previous position does not necessarily clear the Clibrarys own internal buffer. I am still not fully convinced with this explanation as in some cases repro cases the file pointer resetting never happened. p  pAnyway, I did some more search on the web, and some thread seemed to suggest using lowerlevel streams and handle the buffering in the library itself. So I have changed the implementation of the function above and its other helpers to do just that. I am now using sopensreadlseek for Windows and standard POSIX interface for LinuxSolaris to perform the lowerlevel IO handling. With these changes it seems to work, I am not seeing the issue anymore. p  pThank you all for your time. All your input is much appreciated.p  pSuman p  p UPDATE 2 p  pWell now I definitely know the reason. The problem is that ftell and fseek are unreliable if the file is opened in text mode. If the file is opened in binary mode, then the function above works fine.p  pHeres a link to an article where someone else found this issue before a hrefhttparstechnica.comcivisviewtopic.phpf20ampt420490 relnofollowhttparstechnica.comcivisviewtopic.phpf20ampt420490ap  pThis is a good thing, because now I have a fix that requires changing 1 line, instead of 200 p

Negative 136 pI know this might be a old question, but I want to focus on the probability.p  pMy first question is in C, coderandcode will give a number from code0code to codeRANDMAXcode, does each number in this interval have the same probability to be chosen by coderandcodep  pThe second question if coderandcode lets each number from code0code to codeRANDMAXcode to have the same or approximately same probability to be chosen, when I want to get a random number from 0 to N1 N1 lt RANDMAX, Ill do this generallyp  precoderandN codepre  pBut if codeRANDMAXcode is NOT the multiple of N, the probability of random number chosen from 0 to N1 might not be samep  pFor instance, suppose RANDMAX150 and N100, when I do coderand100code, the number from 0 to 49 will have a higher probability to be chosen than the number from 50 to 99 because 150 is not the multiple of 100.p  pIs there a algorithm or function in C, which can let each random number have the same probability to be chosenp

Negative 136 pIv been having a problem and i didnt find anything by Googleing it The scenario is as follows...br I installed codexamppcode and use it to develop my website in php I wrote .php codes in my codehtdocscode folder, test it locally by codelocalhostcode and when it works correctly, i upload it to webserver using codeFileZillacode. Everything works perfectbr The problem is that I use MySQL php commands like codemysqlconnect...code in my local files, and it gives me error in local test browser because the connection namepass and databases is different from what it should be on server, but it works OK on server side So, the problem is when MySQL commands come into play, I cant test it locally then publish it to server.br I use codephpMyAdmincode to configure databases in both local and server side.br One solution would be to have 2 different folder, one for local test, and one for server. but every time I change a file in local folder, I should go and change it in another folder, then upload it... which is a nightmarebr Other solution that im currently using is simply i upload every change and test it on server which i think its not correctbr I really appreciate any suggestion to work around this problem  p

Negative 136 pI want to create a program codeFoo.execode with error logging into codefoo.logcode. That program is installed NSIS Installer into codeCProgram Files x86Foocode. During installation NSIS added a shortcut codeCreateShortCut SMSTARTUPFoo.lnk INSTDIRFoo.execode to start codeFoo.execode when windows starts.p  ul liWhen windows executes my program after startup it starts my program with nonadministrative rights.. So my program can not edit codeCProgram Files x86Foofoo.logcode. Workaround for that is to store editable files in another directory e.g. in codeAPPDATAcode.li liBut here comes the real problem I added a update function into my program which works in the following way ul lidownload the new binary and save as codeFooNew.execode. This file does not have any permissions explicitly not the executeflag.li licreate a selfcopy with execute permission codeFooCopy.execodeli liAfter starting it, codeFooCopy.execode opens codeFooNew.execode and writes it content into codeFoo.execode. Now, codeFoo.execode is updated and has the executepermission.li licodeFooCopy.execode will be removed.li ulli ul  pSo I have not testet the updating but most likely it wont work. I assume that codeFoo.execode can not create files in codeCProgram Files x86Foocode so the updating fails at point 1.p  pAn idea is to save codeFoo.execode not in codeCProgram Files x86code but in codeAPPDATAcode. So the program has all needed rights. The question is starting that program It is compiled for 32bit. Is it possible to have a launcher codeCProgram Files x86Foolauncher.execode which starts the real application in codeAPPDATAcodep  pThats confused, isnt it How could I change the autoupdate procedure so that UAC will not kick mep  pAs an example I see codefirefox.execode. How does it updating, thus, writing directly into codeCProgram Files x86...code when normally emno oneem could write into that directory without prompting the user.p  pChrisp

Negative 136 pId like to do a shallow clone of a large repository to reduce the download time. I dont actually need any history or git metadata for this use case. I just need the files in the repository at a specific commit hashtag. Using codedepth 1 branch ltnamegtcode works for the tip of a branch or a tag, but doesnt allow a raw commit hashtag. I saw one workaround where a clone was made with codedepth 50code and followed by a codegit checkoutcode at the desired hashtag. The desired hashtag was always within 50 from the tip, but in my use case, I cant guarantee any fixed distance without defeating the purpose of the shallow clone. Is there another approach to doing this or a configuration option I missedp

The problem is that my generated codejscode that is used as cache by my application contains inline codecode that basically fail when interprated by the browser.p  pNow, Im looking for the source, in first place I thought JSMinPlus was bad and didnt remove the comments, but it does. The problem looks like being due to the size of the file 1Mo, 1.5M chars and at a certain point 750000 chars the comments are not removed anymore.p  pI opened an issue on the repo, here a hrefhttpscode.google.compminifyissuesdetailid308 relnofollowhttpscode.google.compminifyissuesdetailid308ap  pTo be sure its due to the size, I made a test by executing twice my code and creating two different files in the cache, the second much smaller than the first one.p  pThe result is clear enough for mep  pIf I import all my files a hrefhttpsgist.githubusercontent.comVadorequest10422717raw636fdd6c377424dbc9baea86a76217a4f240fc7fdefault.js relnofollowhttpsgist.githubusercontent.comVadorequest10422717raw636fdd6c377424dbc9baea86a76217a4f240fc7fdefault.jsap  pIf I import just a few libraries a hrefhttpsgist.github.comVadorequest10422779 relnofollowhttpsgist.github.comVadorequest10422779ap  pemPlease search for fancyboxjqueryfancyboxthumbs.js and compare between both files.emp  pIm not sure the file size or memory used is related to the problem, at a certain point it doesnt delete the comments anymore.p  pDid you ever encountered this issue Do you have any idea about what I could dop

Negative 136 pI have a Python script which uses the pyodbc module to connect to SQL Express 2008. It selects the records in a SQL Server table over 600,000 rows and updates a column in that table using a complicated REGEX based function parseAddress to extract an address value from two table fields. p  pWhen I test this on a TEMP table created from a subset of the data it works fairly fast 10,000 rows in 133.8 seconds 74 per second but on the 600,000 row table it slows down considerably. Interestingly, if I pull the 600,000 records into ArcGIS, export them to a filegeodatabase and run the parseAddress as a field calculator, it completes extremely quickly. I was trying to avoid the extra processing in Arc if possible, hoping that it would be faster on the database.p  pPythons memory usage goes from 11MB 10,000 rows to about 145MB when loading the larger table I have 8GB of RAM and doesnt get any higher. I am using fetchall and iterating through the result as I was having some trouble getting it to iterate otherwise  I kept getting an error that the Previous SQL Query was not a query when attempting to apply the SQL update using dbCursor, and uCursor was locked from updating while dbCursor was live. I am also unable to access named columns, eg row.ProvID fails, so there might be an issue with my install, I grabbed the latest pyodbc version 3.0.7 today though.p  pI tried the list approach in a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions9402033pythonisslowwheniteratingoveralargelistPython is slow when iterating over a large lista of coderows  listdbCursor.executesqlSelect.fetchallcode , which was 10 faster on my test table, but seems to have a minimal effect on the big table processing.p  pWhat can I do to speed this up emupdate I let it run  667041 records updated in 102296.9 seconds 6.5 per secondemp  pAlternatively, if there is some way I could write this in SQL directly I would love to know.

Negative 136 pThis seems really poorly documented.. The a hrefhttpmongoosejs.comdocsapi.htmldocumentDocumentupdate relnofollowdocumentationa example just has codecallbackcode being passed to update.  There is a link redirecting to codeModel.updatecode a hrefhttpmongoosejs.comdocsapi.htmlmodelModel.update relnofollowherea and the example shows the parameters of the callback are codeerr, numberAffected, rawcode.p  pDoes the Documentupdate callback pass the same parameters  I was hoping to get the updated document returned.

Negative 136 pIve got an iPhone app that has been live for some time now. Mostly, in app purchases work great, but for some users lt 1, SKProductsRequest is returning 0 products should be 1. p  pDoes anyone have any insights into why this might be happening I am stumped as to how to reproduce the problem locally. Things Ive ruled out arep  ul liNo net connection at request timeli liParental controls on in app purchasesli liJailbreaking vanilla jailbreaking with no tweaks causes no problemsli ul  pI dont know if there are any invalid identifiers returned, but Im not sure this info would help much.p  pOne thing I have been unable to rule out is whether this is only happening for certain stores countries but not others. I wont have data on this until my next release goes live.p  pAny suggestions I am at my wits end. Thanks in advancep  pNote There are a lot of questions on S.O. about SKProductsRequest returning 0 products, but these all seem to be about problems while testing SKProductsRequest prerelease, and not after a successful deployment where failure is intermittent.p
Negative 136 pWould like to check if there is any free or less cost service available to show a location in the map Currently, in one of our clients website, there is a requirement to show the current location this location is however obtained by one of clients own program. However since its just a plotting of coordinates in the map, the client is not willing to invest on license provided by Google or by Bing because the license given by these guys are for the entire API and in this case there is no need for the entire API as the locations latlong are already available. And since our client charges the consumers a fee not just for the map but for various other functionalities , there is an ask for a proper license. Any idea or thoughtsp  pThanksp

Negative 136 pI have tomcat setup to create 100 log files, with each file being 5MBs. One of the things that bothers me is that tomcat will rename every file, once the file being written currently reaches its size limit. Assume a basename of codemyFile.logcode, codemyFile.log.98code will be moved codemyFile.log.99code overwriting codemyFile.log.99code, codemyFile.log.97code will be moved to codemyFile.log.98code ... and finally codemyFile.logcode will be codemyFile.log.1code, and a new codemyFile.logcode is created. That is a lot of renames to go through.p  pI want to change this renaming strategy to the following Persist a number, say codencode, which is incremented each time we have a log rotation. Move the current file, codemyFile.logcode, to codemyFile.log.ltngtcode, and remove the file codemyFile.log.ltn100gtcode, if any. Two file system operations. The latest is always the one with the highest number. No renaming to be done.p  ul liIs there a rolling strategy to implement that or something that achieves my goal of no renamingli liIf not, can I implement a class that overrides the original rollerli liFinally, is this an unreasonable thing to ask I.e., so unimportant that should not think about itli ul  pThanks.p

Negative 136 pemThe biggest problem is that I even dont really know how to describe the problem Im asking about. Its the first time in more then a decade of wed development.em p  pIm working on a Rails 4.1.1 app and using angularjs pretty extensively, though I dont know it well yet. And everything seemed to be working fine up to the moment when I tried to add some browser history manipulation to my app e.g. changing the displayed url when listing though a paginated list so that that url can be copied and distributed. To do this I added a config to my app.p  precodeapp.config locationProvider gt   locationProvider.html5Modetrue codepre  pAnd then in my angular controller added the location binding like thisp  precodescope.watch pagination.cur, newVal gt   scope.loadNews newVal   location.pathnews.searchpagenewVal codepre  pthis is ment to change the url in the browser searchbox when the user goes from one page to another.p  pThat workes well, the url does change appropriately, but all the sudden strongall the html links on the page got brokenstrong. I mean litteraly. I click any link on the page even outside the controller div, the url in the serchbox changes appropriately, but the turbolinks toes not fire the Ajax request to get the new page content. If I then refresh the page, it loads the correct page. p  pI know its really weird. Whats weirder, that I dont get any JavaScript errors or anything unusual.  The only way I found to get the links working again  is to remove that initial config.br But when I do it, the location falls back to hashtag syntax, wich is really not at all what I want.p  pMy only assumption is that there could be some kind of a conflict between angular location service and turbolinks when handling browser history, but even if thats right, I have no idea how to get around it. And I really need that kind of manipulation, cause Im going to be using it alot in this and other apps. p  pemI really dont know, what other information on this problem may be usefull, dont hasitate to ask for updates. Ill post whatever I can.emp  pP.S. Btw, can this kind of manipulation be done by means of turbolinks Cause its exactly the same thing turbolinks does when changing the displayed url after page body reload, but I cant find any documentation on its public API for that.p  pstrongUPDATEstrongp  ol lipHave no idea whats the source of the problem yet, but it seems to be not related to the turbolinks gem. Removing turbolinks requirements from the application.js file does not change anything.pli lipUsing window.history.pushState instead of location.path solves the functionality problem, but does not explain the initial bug.pli ol

Negative 136 pI can successfully bind a DataTable to a GridView by auto generating columns, but I need to display a multilined cell for one of the columns. To do this, I want to use a template field with an item template using a TextBox object. I fill in the DataTable by adding columns and then adding the rows.

My issue is getting the gridview to extract my data based on the column names and filling in the template fields I have set up. If  I turn AutoGenerateColumns off then the 4 templatefield columns still appear in the correct amount according to the datatable too, just blank, and if I have it set to true, then the 4 blank columns appear as well as 4 additional columns with the same headers that contain my data using the defaults for what the cell contains to display the information.p  precode    ltaspGridView IDDataGrid1 runatserver AutoGenerateColumnsFalse     HeaderStyleBorderStyleNone CellPadding3 ItemStyleWraptrue gt     ltColumnsgt         ltaspTemplateField HeaderTextCodegt             ltaspItemTemplategt                 ltaspLabel IDtxtCode runatserver Textlt EvalCode gtgt                  ltaspLabelgt             ltaspItemTemplategt         ltaspTemplateFieldgt         ltaspTemplateField HeaderTextTitlegt             ltaspItemTemplategt                 ltaspLabel IDtxtTitle runatserver Textlt EvalTitle gtgt                  ltaspLabelgt             ltaspItemTemplategt         ltaspTemplateFieldgt         ltaspTemplateField HeaderTextClassgt             ltaspItemTemplategt                 ltaspLabel IDtxtClass runatserver Textlt EvalClass gtgt                  ltaspLabelgt             ltaspItemTemplategt         ltaspTemplateFieldgt         ltaspTemplateField HeaderTextHistorygt             ltaspItemTemplategt                 ltaspTextBox IDtxtHistory runatserver IsReadOnlytrue Textlt EvalHistorygtgt                 ltaspTextBoxgt             ltaspItemTemplategt         ltaspTemplateFieldgt     ltColumnsgt ltaspGridViewgt codepre  pThe above is the portion of my asp.net code that relates to the GridView in question.

Negative 136 pIm new to Eclipse RCP development and just built an initial prototype application on e4, because e4 tutorials are the first to shown on Google and it seems to the be recommended API. But now after the very basic functions are completed, I found that nobody seems to be mixing e4 with anything in Eclipse IDE itself  such as preference dialog, perspectives list UI etc  if there is anyone using e4 in realworld projects at all. I checked the source of Luna and then realized that basically all features are still implemented on old 3.x API.p  pSo what should I do now While its still possible to continue with e4, there are no more examples other than those in platform source, and no more book I bought the only one or practical tutorials covering topics such as integrating with editor or outline. Or I could just give up now and remake everything with old API  but what would I losep
Negative 136 pWhen building a C DLL or shared library codeattributevisibilitydefaultcode or codedeclspecdllexportcode is frequently attached via a macro to those concrete symbols classes, functions, etc that should be made available to consumers of the library, with the other symbols defaulted to have internal visibility.p  pBut what should be done about inline functions or templatesp  pIt seems that for inline functions the answer should be that no annotation is needed. If the consumer of the header defining the inline function actually inlines the function, then there is no symbol needed. If the consumer emits an outofline definition instead, that is still OK. The only wrinkle is that the definitions of the inline function inside the DLL and inside each consuming library may differ. So, you could get some trouble if you were expecting to reliably compare the addresses of inline functions, but that seems pretty sketchy anyway.p  pGiven that argument, it would seem that since templates bodies are typically entirely visible to the consuming TU, that the same logic would apply.p  pI feel like there are probably some subtleties here with respect to extern template and explicit instantiations.p  pDoes anyone have concrete guidance on how visibility attributes should adhere to inline functions and templatesp

Negative 136 pIm working on a small homemade 3D engine and more precisely on rendering optimization.

So, if I have a scene composed by 10 boxes, all sharing the same texture and need to be rendered with the same shader program for example including ADS lighting so all the vertices of these meshes will be merged into a unique VBO, the texture will be bind just one time and one simple draw call only will be needed.p  precodeScene description   10 meshes boxes mapped with texture1  Pseudocode render  shaderProgram1gtBind       glActiveTexturetexture1      DrawCallrender 10 meshes with texture1  codepre  pBut now I want to be sure one thing Lets assume our scene is always composed by the same 10 boxes but this time 5 of them will be mapped with a different texture not multitexturing, just simple texture mapping.p  precodeScene description   5 boxes with texture1  5 boxes with texture2  Pseudocode render  shaderProgram1gtBind       glActiveTexturetexture1      DrawCallrender 5 meshes with texture1  shaderProgram2gtBind       glActiveTexturetexture2      DrawCallrender 5 meshes with texture2  codepre  pAnd my fragment shader has a unique declaration of sampler2D the goal of my shader program is to render geometry with simple texture mapping and ADS lightingp  precodeuniform sampler2D ColorSampler codepre  pI want to be sure its not possible to draw this scene with a unique draw call like it was possible with my previous example 1 batch was needed.

Negative 136 pI am starting to learn serverside development and want to do TDD. I am also deploying with Jenkins for Continuous Integration. When I run tests during development, I want to use localhost as the server name, but when the tests run with Jenkins, they should use the production server instead.

Negative 136 pI am trying to properley implement a background worker with a progress bar in my app. What my app does is check to see if certain files exist on the PC. If they dont, it will copy the files from a server over to the PC. It also checks, if the files do already exist, to see if there are any newer versions of the file for download. If so, it copies them over.p  pI would like to implement a background worker with progress bar to show the user how far done it is. My work consists of 4 methods that fire to check for and copy the files. And that is where I get confused. All examples I have seen with progress bars and background workers dont usually have methods in the DoWork of the worker.p  pHere is my codep  precodeprivate void btnClickClickobject sender, EventArgs e              Form1 frm  new Form1         frm.Enabled  false to insure the user doesnt close the form until the progress is completed         worker  new BackgroundWorker         worker.WorkerSupportsCancellation  false         worker.DoWork  DoWork         worker.ProgressChanged  ProgressChanged         worker.WorkerReportsProgress  true         worker.RunWorkerAsync         worker.RunWorkerCompleted  workerRunWorkerCompleted         while worker.IsBusy I think this is my mistake.

It does copy. My problem is the bar fills up before the actual work starts. And if I move the increment code, it doesnt fill up 100. The files are copied but the bar would be only 10 full.p  pSo basically, I know I have put the increment code in the wrong place, but I dont know where the code should go.p  pAn ugly way to do this would be to put codeworker.ReportProgress25code and increment by 25 in the DoWork and just fill it when completed, while commenting out codeprogressBar.Increment1code in the codewhile worker.IsBusycode code.

Negative 136 pNow a days I hear different terms like Webservice, API, Rest, RestFulAPI, SOAP etc. We write a RestApi by using google cloud end points for our mobile application. Even though we are implementing RestAPI, I have a lot of confusion about the terms which I have mentioned.

Negative 136 pMy model takes two numbers from one sheet, adds the average to another sheet in the last cell of a defined column. The problem that I have is that when I insert a new column, the references get missed up and Im trying to have a macro that would 1. take the average 2. look for a specific column on the second sheet 3. paste the averaged value to the last cell.p  pPlease help me with this I have been trying to get my head around it for a long time.p  pmy problem is that I have to insert new columns and I need to keep the references dynamic when adding a value to the last empty cell in a column. For example if i have salary as col A, and expenses as Col B  in this model that I have now I put in .CellsemptyRow, 1 and .CellsemptyRow, 2 now if I insert a column between A and B the references 1 and 2 will not work. Is there anyway that I can work around this where if i add a new column it wont mess up the references in the macro  Thank you.p  pThis is the code that I have right now but it does not really work  when I insert a new column the column defined name does not shift right. p  precodeSub demo      Dim expCol As Long, FirstEmptyRow As Long      RangeBB.Cells.Name  expenses      expCol  Rangeexpenses.Column      FirstEmptyRow  CellsRows.Count, expCol.EndxlUp.Row  1      CellsFirstEmptyRow, expCol.Value  123  End Sub codepre  pP.S. 123 here is just an example for testing purposes. The value that would replace it in my model is the average I talk about in the question. p

Negative 136 pI find that the codestdmutexcode implementation in Visual Studio 2013 is too slow.

Negative 136 pI am using Apache CXF with Spring and Dozer Mapper to convert DTOs Database Objects in to models. For strongHibernatestrong side I have enabled codelazyextracode and codelazytruecode for mapping and which works fine hibernate loads child whenever respective getter methods are called. But when I convert DTO using dozer mapper it calls getter methods of all the child object in some case it was not necessary but in some it is not necessary. Is there any way by using which I can reduce overheads. p

Negative 136 pWhere I work we use Git for our current projects, but we have a few legacy projects on SVN.  Im looking at converting a couple of large legacy projects 26,000 commits from SVN to Git.p  pHowever, the issue I have is that we also wish to keep the SVN repositories.  The reason for this is that deployments are handled by updatingswitching SVN checkouts existing on client environments Updating our deployment scripts to use Git, reconfiguring all of our clients environments to use Git checkouts etc. is a very big task We think that the benefits of switching to Git having a single VCS with a consistent pullrequestcodereview process for all projects are sadly outweighed by the costs involved in doing this.p  pSo as a compromise, wed like to have a workflow that looks like thisp  ul liGithub pull request.li liMerge pull request to master.li liUpdate SVN with latest code in Git master branch.li liUpdate SVN checkout on client server.li ul  pSVN would only be written to as part of this process i.e. wed only need to synchronise in one direction Git to SVN.p  pIve seen the codegit svncode command and a hrefhttpsgithub.comnirvdrumsvn2git relnofollowhttpsgithub.comnirvdrumsvn2gita and a colleague has successfully generated Git repositories from SVN using this.  However, I wasnt able to easily get commits back into SVN after checking out the repository from Github that he generated.  Wed originally planned to use codegit svn dcommitcode to do this, but, as I understand it, this command essentially requires the Git repository to be synchronised with SVN.  codegit svn dcommitcode does not seem to work with a fresh checkout of the Git repository I believe this is because codegit svn initcode and codegit svn fetchcode need to have been run before codedcommitcode will work please correct me if Im wrong.p  pThe problem with this is that codegit svn fetchcode takes emdaysem to run on repositories this large.  Any developer wishing to perform a release would need to have a Git checkout synchronised with SVN, which doesnt seem like a reasonable option, particularly when it is considered that these are legacy projects that will be worked on, but infrequently.p  pAs an alternative to codedcommitcode, Ive written a script to checkout the SVN and Git repositories, delete the contents of the SVN checkout and replace it with the contents of the Git repository, then commit back to SVN.  The atomicity of the commits and the history for new commits would not be copied to SVN using this approach, but that is not a concern.  The history would still exist in Git As long as SVN reflects the latest state of the files in Git, its not a problem.  This emalmostem seems to work, but there are some issues with this script generating large whitespace commits for lineending changes and deleting empty directories from SVN Git does not support committing empty directories like SVN does.p  pIs there a better way to handle this workflow  If the script is the way to go, can you suggest any configuration options to make this process run smoothly  Im thinking SVNs codeeolstylecode and Gits codecore.autocrlfcode settings may be able to be used to work around this possibly in combination with a tool like codedos2unixcode, but I cant quite work out the best approach.  I may be able to fix the empty directories issue with code.gitkeepcode placeholder files, but this will obviously require the code to be tested to ensure that these files can exist without causing problems Is there another way around thisp  pAny advice appreciated.p

Negative 136 pI have the following HTMLp  precodeltdiv classrow ngrepeatquestion in currentTemplate.questionsgt     ltdiv classcolxs4 ngshoweditingQuestion[index]gt         ltselect stylewidth100 ngmodeleditingCurrentlySelectedAnswerOption[index]         ngoptionsanswerOption as answerOption.back for answerOption in answerOptionsgt         ltselectgt     ltdivgt ltdivgt codepre  pI am wondering how I set the value of what is shown in the select statement.  When the page loads, it should already be set, because I go through a for loop to set the values of editingCurrentlySelectedAnswerOption so that each one is preselected the [index] is referring to the index of an ngrepeat which this is inside of.  Since there are multiple selects inside the ngrepeat, I need one spot per ngrepeat in the array to keep track of each individual selection, but instead it comes up as a blank spot first.  I have used nginit, a function that is called whenever a button is pressed which unhides the above div, and a function when the page loads.  I have used bindings in the DOM and console.logs to check the values.  They all seem to be correct.  answerOptions in the ngoptions isp  precodevar answerOptions  [      front RadioButton, back MultiChoice       front CheckBox, back MultiAnswer       front TextBox, back Free Text  ] codepre  pWhen I print what editingCurrentlySelectedAnswerOption[index] is it always comes up correctly showing an object just like one of the above objects, but for some reason it is always a blank select statement when it loads.

Negative 136 pI have a fairly large Windows application about 10 years old, written in c which works with SQL2000 Express MSDE. It operates with database pretty extensively, but doesnt have performance issues. Due to SQL2000 MSDE compatibility issues with Windows 78 I want to migrate the application to SQL2014 Express. p  pAll database access code is written in tsql and as such the application migrates to SQL2014 without any code changes and all features work as expected. Except its so badly slow it makes no sense to use the application under SQL2014. All selectupdateinsert queries take about 520 times more time to execute.p  pThese are connection strings that I triedp  precodeProviderSQLOLEDBData SourcelocalhostappUser IDappuserPasswordpassword ProviderSQLOLEDBData SourcelocalhostappTrustedConnectionyes codepre  pI dont convert SQL2000 database to 2014 as the application creates a new database from scratch from scripts on its first run. Nothing fails, the default DB size is 12MB, the schema is pretty well optimised.p  pI also tried the same under SQL2008R2 Express  its as slow as SQL2014 Express. Tried different PCs under Windows 788.1  all the same.p  pThe main detail which I noticed is that when I run the application under SQL2014 the most CPU consuming process in Windows Task Manager is Local Security Authority Process. This process doesnt appear in Task Manager at all when I run it under SQL2000 MSDE and the application runs much faster. I guess LSA may be very heavy processing my open connection requests, but I dont know what to do about it.p  pThe application is written is a way that it doesnt keep connections open, but creates them on demand and then releases. I tried to run SQL 2014 service under different accounts  it made no difference.p

After having a similar problem I updated my JDBC driver mysqlconnectorjava5.1.26bin.jar. The error then changed from      User does not have access to metadata required to determine stored procedure parameter types. If rights can not be granted, configure connection with noAccessToProcedureBodiestrue to have driver generate parameters that represent INOUT strings irregardless of actual parameter types.  to      No access to parameters by name when connection has been configured not to access procedure bodies  I changed my Callable Statement to reference parameters by index instead of name, and hey presto it works.  Updating the driver may not be necessary, just knowing to use indexes instead of names when you dont have metadata access or routine body access.

Negative 136 pSorry if I sound unexperienced or make no sense, Im currently in my second computer science year and Im currently making a light 2D game engine in java for a school project  We can choose what we want to do for this one .p  pSo Im currently working on the asset manager. For now it contains a hashmap with assets and a InputStreamProvider.p  pThe InputStreamProvider is an interface between the assetManager and different kind of providers. For now, I only have a FileProvider which provides a stream from a file. p  pFor now everything is ok, but when it comes to actually retrive the file from an id, I got a small problem with the extension. I thought that one of the advantages of using an asset manager was that you could just use IDs for your assets, which is fine once they are loaded, but when you need to load them how do you know the file extentionp  pHere is my workaround which is obviously not a good solution using a config file which lists the extentions being used for the assets and then trying to load the file with every extention.p  precodepublic class FileProvider extends AssetInputStreamProvider   private final static String assetLocation  assets protected final static ListltStringgt assetExtentions  new ArrayListltgt  static      try          InputStreamReader isr  new InputStreamReadernew FileInputStreamnew Fileconfassets.cfg         while isr.ready              String ext  new String             Character c  char isr.read             while c.equals,                  ext  c                 c  char isr.read                          assetExtentions.addext               catch FileNotFoundException ex          Logger.getLoggerAssetInputStreamProvider.class.getName.logLevel.SEVERE, null, ex      catch IOException ex          Logger.getLoggerAssetInputStreamProvider.class.getName.logLevel.SEVERE, null, ex         Override public InputStream getInputStreamString type, String name       File file     for String assetExtention  assetExtentions          try              System.out.printlnassetLocation  type    name  .  assetExtention             file  new FileassetLocation  type    name  .  assetExtention             return new FileInputStreamfile          catch FileNotFoundException ex              Logger.getLoggerFileProvider.class.getName.logLevel.SEVERE, null, ex                    return null  codepre  p    p  pSo Id like to know if there is a way to load a file without knowing its extention, or if Im completely mistaken about the way to load assets and then if anyone could tell me the way to do it properly it would be really helpful.p  pAnd out of curiosity, its out of the scope of my question but Ive seen some people using integer for IDs but no matter how much I think about it, I cant figure how to do it without hardcoding resources and giving them an int value so Id like to get some hints to know how to implement such a system too.p  pThanks a lot for reading and have a good day.p

Negative 136 pI have an application that uses COM to automate Word. It needs to run even when a user is not logged in. I achieved this on Windows 7 by making it run as a scheduled task which runs at startup and doesnt require a user to be logged on. I also had to use the hack where you add a Desktop folder in CWindowsSysWow64configsystemprofile.p  pI tried this same method in Windows Server 2012, but it doesnt work. I can see in the task scheduler that the application is starting an instance of Word. However, it then appears to hang and nothing happens. I think perhaps the invisible instance of Word is showing an error message which causes the whole thing to hang, as I cannot dismiss the message.p  pHas anyone else had trouble getting COM to work on windows server Is there any way of showing hidden instances of Word to see if an error dialog is showing Or any other way of diagnosing what the problem isp  pI know ideally we would have an app that created the word documents without using COM, but this is not an option at the moment.p

When the switch is false, just the second part of the block runs, as expected.

Assume t is 4th local variable.                mv.visitVarinsniload, 4    else ifb instanceof Doublemv.visitVarinsn     else ifb instanceof Bytemv.visitVarinsn     mv.visitVarInsnINVOKEVIRTUAL, .., test, methodType codepre  pAs there are too long ifelse condition test for bs type, i am wondering whether there is already some existing ASM API can do this for me. p

Negative 136 pI started studying PHP few weeks ago and Im a little bit confused with conditional embed HTML between PHP code blocks and setting cookies. What I want to do is a simple code that checks your name, password and email, sets cookie if they are valid when you have already logged in, you should see log out button. So, my codep  precode    ltphp     if POST[name]  admin  and POST[pass]  admin and POST[mail]  admingmail.com      setcookieTest,Value      echo Success ltbrgt            if POST[logout]      setcookieTest, , time  3600     echo Goodbye            gt      ltphp ifissetCOOKIE[Test]      gt        ltinput typesubmit valuelogoutgtltbrgt      ltphp endif gt      ltphp ifissetCOOKIE[Test]      gt     ltDOCTYPE html PUBLIC W3CDTD HTML 4.01 TransitionalEN httpwww.w3.orgTRhtml4loose.dtdgt     ltform action methodPOSTgt     ltinput typetext namenamegtltbrgt     ltinput typetext namepassgtltbrgt     ltinput typetext namemailgtltbrgt     ltinput typesubmit valuegogtltbrgt     ltphp endif gt codepre  pHowever, I cant figure out how to make it work properly when I enter correct username, password and mail, I dont see logout button, theres still a form and i need to enter username again to finally see logout. Second problem, when I press logout, nothing happens. I guess I cant set the cookie because headers were already sent, but I cant figure out how to rewrite it.p

However, in both cases the codeperf reportcode for codee cputxabortcode  points to the intuitively correct assembly lines an codexabortcode instruction for the first example and a codesyscallcode one for the second one.  In the real codebase, the perf report points to a stack push right at the start of a functionp  precode               00000000004167e0 ltmynsmyfungt     100.00       4167e0       push   rbp       0.00       4167e1       mov    rsp,rbp       0.00       4167e4       push   r15 codepre  pI have also run the same command under the intel software development emulator. It turns out that the problem goes away in that case I get no aborts as far as the application is concerned.p

Negative 136 pI am trying to get a TileWMS layer working with the CS as CRS1 defined in WMS1.3.0. By defining the right projection stated in CRS1, axisorientation as es, I could get it working for ImageWMS. However, when using TileWMS, I found all the tileGrids defined in open layer 3 are always aligned with en direction. tileindex x increments as x goes right, tileindex y increments as y goes up. So it is different from the CRS1 definition. This causes the tiles are put into wrong direction in y axis.p  pMy question is that is there any way that I can change tiling direction to follow the axixorientation defined in my projection, in this case, is es Or are there any advice or examples for es projection like CRS1 in tiled API of open layer 3 p

Negative 136 pI am trying to design a small program for future AP Computer Science students which will allow them to create and customize a GUI very easily. For more advanced users, I would like to give them the option to write their own code to help themselves customize their GUI even further. As you can see below, I have a few menu options that are prebuilt, and allow for very basic editing of their GUI.  However, I also have an add menu item option.  Ideally, this should display the text within the JTextArea link to screenshot below, and allow for the user to write whatever code they want which can interact with the class and all of its accessible elements.  So, for example, if a user was to write something very simple likep  precode    System.out.printlnhello codepre  pwhich would replace thep  precode     code to execute goes here...  codepre  pand renamed thep  precode    NAMEOFMENUITEMHERE codepre  ptop  precode    print hello codepre  pand then proceeded to hit the CREATE JButton, a new menu item would appear before quit called print hello, and whenever it was selected, the program would print hello to the terminal window. Obviously, it could get quite a bit more complicated than that, and therefore I think I can see some great potential in this idea, but I dont know how to begin.  Ive dug around quite a lot and have seen a bunch of dynamic code execution methods, as well as reflection, but Im not sure that either of these two ideas will work, and if so, I dont know how to implement them. pMy menu items are set up so that they are stored within an ArrayList which contains anonymous classes of my Executable class as seen belowp  precodepublic abstract class Executable       private String name     private BasicWindow window     private int xPos  0      public ExecutableString name, BasicWindow window          this.name  name         this.window  window           public BasicWindow getWindow  return window       public String getName  return name       public void setNameString name  this.name  name       public abstract void execute      public void setXPosint xPos  this.xPos  xPos      public int getXPos  return xPos    codepre  pAnytime an item is selected, my program will call its execute method.  As an example, for my first two menu items, they are made like sop  precodemenuItems.addnew Executabletoggle resizable currently false, this          public void execute              window.setResizablewindow.isResizable             setNametoggle resizable currently window.isResizable                menuItems.addnew Executabletoggle undecorated currently false, this          public void execute              window.dispose             window.setUndecoratedwindow.isUndecorated             setNametoggle undecorated currently window.isUndecorated             window.setVisibletrue               codepre  pSo to sum it all up, I need help  Is what Im trying to do even possible  And if so, how would I go about doing it Im pretty much all selftaught in this area they dont teach you this stuff in AP haha, so while I think I have a good understanding of what Ive done so far, I only have a year of experience with Java, and am sure that my techniques arent the greatest.

Negative 136 pIm writing a Python application that interacts with a MySql database. The basic way to do this is to connect to the database and execute the queries using the databases cursor object.

Negative 136 pIm using the C ODBC function SQLExecute to run a query and if it returns anything other than one of SQLSUCCESS, SQLSUCCESSWITHINFO, SQLNODATA Im calling SQLGetDiagRec to retrieve the most recent error. This all works fine but I recently had the application which performs this logic just start to apparently leak memory really quickly and then crash. After some investigation I discovered that it was running a stored procedure which had got into an infinite loop and was erroring with each loop and the memory increase was due to the status message queue in ODBC growing with the error messages. We have many hundreds of stored procedures so it would be quite a job to check them all although we probably should so Im trying to build in some defences into the application.p  pIve subsequently added a call to SQLCancel if the query takes longer than an arbitrary time but Id also like to monitor the size of the ODBC status message queue whilst the query is being executed. Ive tried calling SQLGetDiagField whilst the call to SQLExecute is running but it just blocks and then it also blocks the SQLCancel from working. It looks from the documentation that you cant call the diagnostics functions during a call to SQLExecute along with SQLConnect, SQLFetch etc.. which would explain the blocking and also that ODBC imposes no limit on the number fo diagnostic records that can be stored at any one time this means that even if our arbitrary timeout is quite short the status messages could have balloned the memory usgage anyway by the time we call SQLCancel. I also know for sure that SQLCancel does clear the status message queue assuming that its not too late by the time we call it.p  pSo what Id like to do is to monitor the ODBC status messages during a call to SQLExecute and possibly even consume them during the execute. So when the number of errors gets to 100 for example we would issue a call to SQLCancel and then have our timeout mechanism as a backup. The only hope I can see is that theres some way of limiting the status messages at the SQL Server driver level if theres nothing I can do at the ODBC level.p  pAny suggestions or comments would be most welcome.p

But, new tasks are being scheduled at a rate of 20   per second, so the internal queue in the task executor will grow at a   rate of 16 per second while the process is idle, so we essentially   have a memory leak.p      pOne of the ways to handle this is to set the queuecapacity attribute   of  the Task Executor to 0.p blockquote  pCan someone please elaborate it.p  pHere is my understanding of the above codep  ppoolsize is 20  so 20 threads will execute.p  preceivetimeout is 5 seconds So 20 threads will be given 5 seconds to complete the tasks.p  pfixed rate is 50 ms  so new tasks are being scheduled at a rate of 20 per second.p  pI have few questionsp  pQ. what will happen if it takes more than 5 seconds to execute 20 threadsp  pQ.

Negative 136 pI am trying to make a GUI that allows you to add or remove members to a group. How i did it was for the member view i created a VBox layout to hold all the members. Each member has its own grid layout. When the user presses add member it will add a members layout to the VBoxThe area to view all the members. The problem is when i press remove member, it will remove the member below the one i want to remove and on the last member the GUI gives an error saying Could not remove member index 2, size 2.p

Negative 136 pI just came to a strange JAVA problem that i cant fix. p  pI call a JAVA bean to retrieve some values from a view. To do that i call a JAVA class to do the Lookup.p  pThe lookup is called twice. Once with the currentUser id and after that with SessionAsSigner to retrieve documents the currentUser cant read because of reader fields.p  pHere is my observation It seems that the first time you retrieve a sessioneither the asSigner or currentSession this session will be then the only session you can use in this thread. Once you call the other method it will still be either the currentSession or the asSigner session.p  pI tried to recylce the session, write 2 beans that carry only the session, write two JAVA classes that each host different sessions the result is always the same. The first session initialized is the only session you can get. To retrieve the session i used already the ExtLib class, DomUtils and VariableResolver but it seems to be always the same issue regardless how i get the sessions.p  pHere is a small example and the result i getp  pExample 1p  precodeSession sUtil.getCurrentSession VectorltStringgtresultUtil.lookups,view,key result is empty because user cant read the documents OK Session sUtil.getSessionasSigner VectorltStringgtresultUtil.lookups,view,key result is empty although Signer can read document NOK codepre  pExample 2p  precode Session sUtil.getSessionasSigner  VectorltStringgtresultUtil.lookups,view,key  result returns the documents OK  Session sUtil.getCurrentSession  VectorltStringgtresultUtil.lookups,view,key  result again returns the documents allthough the user shouldnt be able to read it NOK codepre  pSo whatever i do the second call is always wrong because of that issue. Has anybody any idea what i can do about it.p
