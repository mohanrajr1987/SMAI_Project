Positive 197 pI have a website with a basic bootstrap carousel no nextprevious buttons, titles, etc. that changes through 20 images.  I would like it to randomly select an image from a folder each time instead of me listing each image in the HTML.

This would be much more convenient to update especially if the client wants hundreds of pictures to potentially show in this carousel.  Thanksp
Positive 197 pIm trying to make a function that will fill a list with random numbers, and based on the type of the list items it should generate either integer or floating point numbers. So far Ive come up with the following code, and it works p  precodetemplate lttypename Tgt void generateRandomlistltTgtamp numberList     defaultrandomengine randomGeneratorrandomdevice      if typeidT  typeidint          uniformintdistributionltTgt distribution1000, 2000         auto myGenerator  binddistribution, randomGenerator         generatenumberList.begin, numberList.end, myGenerator          else if typeidT  typeiddouble          uniformrealdistributionltTgt distribution1000.0, 2000.0         auto myGenerator  binddistribution, randomGenerator         generatenumberList.begin, numberList.end, myGenerator          else         return        codepre  pHowever, Im not really satisfied with this solution. It just feels like there should be some way to break out everything but the actual distribution from that IF statement. Something likep  precodetemplate lttypename Tgt void generateRandomlistltTgtamp numberList     defaultrandomengine randomGeneratorrandomdevice      X distribution     if typeidT  typeidint          distribution  uniformintdistributionltTgt1000, 2000     else if typeidT  typeiddouble          distribution  uniformrealdistributionltTgt1000.0, 2000.0     else         return      auto myGenerator  binddistribution, randomGenerator     generatenumberList.begin, numberList.end, myGenerator  codepre  pX is a placeholder for whats missing herep  pBut since codeuniformintdistributioncode and codeuniformrealdistributioncode dont have a common base class, how would that be possible I have tried playing around with function pointers and functors, but I never seem to get past that IFstatement, and its annoying. Can this be solved in a more elegant wayp  pNOTE Its part of a school assignment, and we have to use codegeneratecode and the codeltrandomgtcode functions and templates to generate the random numbers. I think my original solution is acceptable, I just dont like the look of those duplicate lines of code in the IFstatement... p

What Im trying is the simplest thing I thought of, press a button for your choice r, p, or s and that will make a variable used in the rest of the program to compare to the computers choice, finding the winner, etc.  I already have the program worked out, the problem is the GUI stuff.  Im using netbeans and a JFrame, which is completely new to me.  I have a lot of questions, and maybe there is a nice tutorial out there for me someone could link to, but using the official netbeans site hasnt helped much so far.  Anywaysp  ol lipIm not sure where to put my main method code that would be in the text program, make a new class, or put it in the main method of the frame I use.pli lipBecause of that, the reason I cant even compile is that the main function is trying to use the variable I want to make in the button. The whole order of operation is unknown to me I guess.  I looked at the netbeans examples and I think I could make this work by doing something a little more complex, but it seems unnecessarypli ol

Negative 197 pIs there a compiler or standalone preprocessor which takes C files and runs a template expansion pass, generating new C code with expanded template instantiationsp  pI remember such a tool in the mid90s when templates were still new and experimental, and the preprocessor was a way to do template programming with compilers without native template support.p  pThis is a lot more complicated than a macroprocessing step since it would likely require parsing and tokenizing the code to understand the contexts.p  pMy hope is to use such a tool when writing OpenCL code.  a hrefhttpen.wikipedia.orgwikiOpenCL relnofollowOpenCLa is C, but does not support templates.

Complexes have multiple Units, Amenities, Pictures, Links, Documents, and Events. Units have multiple Pictures, Links, and Documents. codepre  pAmenities, Pictures, Links, Documents, and Events all have the necessary foreign keys in the database to specify which unitcomplex they belong to.p  pI need to load the necessary objects from the database into PHP so I can use them in my project.p  pIf I try to select all the data out of the table in 1 query, using LEFT JOINS, Ill get AT LEAST  of links   of pictures   of documents rows for each unique unit. Add amenities, and events to that and Ill get all that   of amenities   of events  for each complex...Not sure I want to try to deal with loading that into an object in PHP.p  pThe other possibility is for each complexunit, execute 1 separate SQL statement each for  links, pictures, documents, events and amenitiesp  pMy questions are as followsp  pIf I properly index all my tables, is it REALLY a bad idea to execute 35 extra queries for each complexunitp  pIf not, how else can I get the data I need to load into a PHP object. Ideally, I would have an object as follows for unitsp  precodeUnit Object      [id]     [mlsnumber]     [type]     [retailprice]     [investorprice]     [quantity]     [beds]     [baths]     [squarefeet]     [description]     [featured]     [yearbuilt]     [hasgarage]     [stories]     [otherfeatures]     [investornotes]     [tourlink]     [complex] gt Complex Object                      [id]             [name]             [description]             etc.              [agent] gt Agent Object                      [id]             [firstname]             [lastname]             [email]             [phone]             [phone2]              etc.               [pictures] gt Array                      [1] gt Picture Object                                                [links] gt Array                      [1] gt Link Object                                                [documents] gt Array                      [1] gt Document Object                                                 codepre  pI dont ALWAYS need ALL of this information, sometimes I only need the primary key of the complex, sometimes I only need the primary key of the agent, etc. But I figured the correct way to do this would be to load the entire object every time I instantiate it.p  pIve been doing a lot of research on OO PHP, but most read all online examples use only 1 table. That obviously doesnt help as the project Im working on has many complex relationships. Any ideas Am I totally off the mark herep  pThanksp  p[UPDATE]p  pOn the other hand, usually on the frontend, which everyone will see, I WILL need ALL the information. For instance, when someone wants information on a specific complex, I need to display all units belonging to that complex, all pictures, document, links, events for the complex as well as all pictures, documents and links for the unit.p  pWhat I was hoping to avoid was, during one page load, executing one query to get the complex I need. Then another query to get the 20 units associated with the complex. Then for each of the 20 units, executing a query for picture, another for documents, another for links, etc. I wanted to get them all at once, with one trip through the database.p  p[EDIT 2] Also, note that the queries to select the pictures, documents, links, events, and agent from the database are pretty simple. Just basic SELECT [list of columns] FROM [table] WHERE [primarykey]  [value] with the occasional INNER JOIN. Im not doing any complex computations or subqueries, just basic stuff.p  p[BENCHMARK] So after reading all the answers to my question, I decided to run a benchmark on what I decided to do. What I do is load all the units that I need. Then as I need to display pictures, document, blah blah, I load them at that time. I created 30,000 test units, each with 100 pictures, 100 documents, and 100 links. Then I loaded a certain number of units I started with 1000, then 100, then the more realistic 10, looped through them, then loaded all pictures, documents and links associated to the unit. With 1000 units, it took approximately 30 seconds. With 100 units, it took about 3 seconds. With 10 units, it took about .5 seconds. There was a lot of variance with the results. Sometimes, with 10 units, it would take .12 seconds. Then it would take .8. Then maybe .5. Then .78. It was really all over the place. However, it seemed to average around half a second. In reality, though, I might only need 6 units at a time, and they each might only have 10 pictures, 5 links and 5 documents associated with them...so I think the grab the data when you need it approach is the best bet in a situation like this. If you needed to get all this data at once though, it would be worthwhile to come up with a single SQL statement to load all the data you need so you are only looping through the data one time 6700 units at a time took 217 seconds while the full 30,000 made PHP run out of memory. p

Negative 197 pIm fairly new to Google App Engine and Python, but I did just release my first realworld site with it.

Negative 197 pWe are writing JUnit tests for a class that uses Spring autowiring to inject a dependency which is some instance of an interface. Since the class under test never explicitly instantiates the dependency or has it passed in a constructor, it appears that JMockit doesnt feel obligated to instantiate it either.p  pUp until now we have been using SpringRunner to have Spring load mock dependencies for us, which works. Two things we dont like about this are 1 the Spring framework has to be loaded and initialized each time running the tests which is not exactly speedy, and 2 we are forced to explicitly create all mock dependencies as real classes, something which JMockit helps eliminate. p  pHeres a simplified example of what were testingp  precodepublic class UnitUnderTest      Autowired    ISomeInterface someInterface     public void callInterfaceMethod         System.out.println UnitUnderTest.callInterfaceMethod calling someInterface.doSomething       someInterface.doSomething       codepre  pSo, the question is, is there a way to have JMockit create a mock codesomeInterfacecodep
Negative 197 pOne line of background Im the developer of a hrefhttpcode.google.compredis relnofollowRedis, a NoSQL databasea. One of the new features Im implementing is Virtual Memory, because Redis takes all the data in memory. Thanks to VM Redis is able to transfer rarely used objects from memory to disk, there are a number of reasons why this works much better than letting the OS do the work for us swapping redis objects are built of many small objects allocated in non contiguous places, when serialized to disk by Redis they take 10 times less space compared to the memory pages where they live, and so forth.p  pNow Ive an alpha implementation thats working perfectly on Linux, but not so well on Mac OS X Snow Leopard. From time to time, while Redis tries to move a page from memory to disk, the redis process enters the uninterruptible wait state for minutes. I was unable to debug this, but this happens either in a call to codefseekocode or codefwritecode. After minutes the call finally returns and redis continues working without problems at all no crash.p  pThe amount of data transfered is emveryem small, something like 256 bytes. So it should not be a matter of a very big amount of IO performed.p  pBut there is an interesting detail about the swap file thats target of the write operation. Its a big file 26 Gigabytes created opening a file with codefopencode and then enlarged using codeftruncatecode. Finally the file is codeunlinkcodeed so that Redis continues to take a reference to it, but we are sure that when the Redis process will exit the OS will really free the swap file.p  pOk thats all but Im here for any further detail. And BTW you can even find the actual code in the Redis git, but its not trivial to understand in five minutes given thats a fairly complex system.p  pThank you very much for any help.p

Negative 197 pI was contracted to build an online knowledge base that searches and crossreferences many thousands of replacement parts for a niche industry.  My client furnishes this app to his customers on a subscription basis.  p  pIt uses MySQL and PHP and it works great.  I want to deploy it in demo mode to sell my skills.  I want the user to see the functions, but I have to guard the data for my client.  p  pMy first idea was to obfuscate the results.  Thats at crosspurposes with showing how well it searches.  Im considering a limit on how many searches you can perform, but thats awkward too as someone could visit every day and get more answers than we would prefer.  p  pOther posts Ive found are about letting people interact with an app, but without the challenge of protecting a big knowledge base.p  pCan you suggest an approach   Note, I put the tag emobfuscationem, but not sure it applies because java code obfuscation seems to be unrelated.p  pUPDATE 1  About obfuscation ...

Negative 197 pstrongGoalstrongp  pPass images generated by one process efficiently and at very high speed to another process. The two processes run on the same machine and on the same desktop. The operating system may be WinXP, Vista and Win7.p  pstrongDetailed descriptionstrongp  pThe first process is solely for controlling the communication with a device which produces the images. These images are about 500x300px in size and may be updated up to several hundred times per second. The second process needs these images to process them. The first process uses a third party API to paint the images from the device to a HDC. This HDC has to be provided by me.p  pNote There is already a connection open between the two processes. They are communicating via anonymous pipes and share memory mapped file views.p  pstrongThoughtsstrongp  pHow would I achieve this goal with as little work as possible And I mean both work for the computer and me of course . I am using Delphi, so maybe there is some component available for doing this I think I could always paint to any image components HDC, save the content to memory stream, copy the contents via the memory mapped file, unpack it on the other side and paint it there to the destination HDC. I also read about a IPicture interface which can be used to marshal images. I need it as quick as possible, so the less overhead the better. I dont want the machine to be stressed just by copying some images.p  pWhat are your ideas I appreciate every thought on thisp

Negative 197 pOK I am going to try to explain this the best I can and maybe someone will understand it. I have a CRM application I am building and have the following tables contacts, email, phone, website and address. I have been trying to create a Query that gathers all the info into one result set. I have kind of found a way that works 99.9 but I think I am missing something for that 1 to work and have killed myself trying to find it. p  pMy query looks like this p  precodeSELECT  contacts.fullname, contacts.title, contacts.company, contacts.background, GROUPCONCAT email.emailtype ORDER BY  email.emailtypeas emailtype, GROUPCONCAT email.email ORDER BY  email.emailtypeas email, GROUPCONCAT phone.phonetype ORDER BY phone.phonetypeas phonetype, GROUPCONCAT phone.phone ORDER BY phone.phonetypeas phone, GROUPCONCAT website.websitetype ORDER BY website.websitetypeas websitetype, GROUPCONCAT website.website ORDER BY website.websitetypeas website, GROUPCONCAT address.type ORDER BY  address.type  as addresstype, GROUPCONCAT address.addressstreet ORDER BY  address.type  as street, GROUPCONCAT address.addresscity ORDER BY  address.type  as city, GROUPCONCAT address.addressstate ORDER BY  address.type  as state, GROUPCONCAT address.addresszip ORDER BY  address.type  as zip, GROUPCONCAT address.addresscountry ORDER BY  address.type as country FROM contacts Left Join email ON contacts.id  email.contactid Left Join phone ON contacts.id  phone.contactid Left Join website ON contacts.id  website.contactid Left Join address ON contacts.id  address.contactid GROUP BY contacts.id ORDER BY contacts.id ASC codepre  pNow like i said it works like 99.9 of the way I want it to but here is the result set now this is a simulated result object but it follows what currently is spit out after the query.p  precodestdClass Object      [fullname] gt John Mueller     [title] gt President     [company] gt Mueller Co.     [background] gt This is the contacts background info.     [emailtype] gt 1,1,1,1     [email] gt jmmc.com,jmmc.com,jmmc.com,jmmc.com     [phonetype] gt 1,2,3,4     [phone] gt 123 5551212,123 5551213,123 5551214,123 5551215     [websitetype] gt 1,1,1,1     [website] gt www.mc.com,www.mc.com,www.mc.com,www.mc.com     [addresstype] gt 1,1,1,1     [street] gt address1,address1,address1,address1     [city] gt city1,city1,city1,city1     [state] gt state1,state1,state1,state1     [zip] gt zip1,zip1,zip1,zip1     [country] gt   codepre  pNow as you can see the result acts like I want it to except for when on one the items has multiple valid items, i.e. in this case John has 4 types of phone numbers and this causes the other records in the DB to multiply accordingly. So in this case you get 4 of the same item in all the other supporting tables. p  pI have tried everything I can and maybe it cant be done but I thought I would try one more time and see if anyone would look at it and say oh yea youre missing 5 letters that will make it work or something. At this point even a your stupid that wont work woud be great too. p  pThanks again for any help anyone can offerp  pUPDATEp  pI feel Like such a noob now, I pulled a classic mistake i checked my result without full verification, but at the same time by the information i provided it was not clear. Ill explain my original solution worked except that when i had 3 work type1 numbers i would end up with a result like phonetype  1 and phone  5551212,5551213,5551214 this is fine but when i have 2 work and 1 home the type identifiers were useless, but i never said that you can have more than one of any type for a contact so actually both of my answer below are correct, with that said the sql was a bit malformed but i knew what he was saying so it actually worked better and correct on the nose. BTW just pulling distint from the type fields wouldnt do it either ... I tried that. p  pPatial new query solution p  precodeSELECT  contacts.fullname, contacts.title, contacts.company, contacts.background,  innerphone.phone, innerphonetype.phonetype  FROM contacts  left Join SELECT phone.contactid, GROUPCONCATphone.phone ORDER BY phone.phonetype as phone FROM phone GROUP BY phone.contactid  innerphone ON contacts.id  innerphone.contactid left Join SELECT phone.contactid, GROUPCONCATphone.phonetype ORDER BY phone.phonetype as phonetype FROM phone GROUP BY phone.contactid  innerphonetype ON contacts.id  innerphonetype.contactid  ORDER BY contacts.id ASC codepre  pThank you for your answers, and as a side note I just canceled that overpriced Experts Exchange this is so much easier to use and find what you are looking for and best of all free   thanks again. p

Negative 197 pI have setup two different PHP systems this summer. Each uses two different methodsp  pstrongMethod 1 One PHP File Per Taskstrongp  pThis method requires that a codePHPcode file be created for each major task. For example, my upload script would be access via codehttpwww.domain.comupload.phpcode. On codeupload.phpcode, a controller and a view class are instantiated and used. For example, codeupload.phpcode might look something like thisp  precodeltphp requireonce PATHLIBRARY . controlUploader.class.php requireonce PATHLIBRARY . viewUploaderPage.class.php  uploader  new Uploader uploadergtsetViewnew UploaderPage uploadergtinit gt codepre  pIn the above script, if I wanted to call on another script, I would simply redirect and append the neccessary URL encoded variables codeheaderLocation editdetails.phpimageid456code.p  pstrongMethod 2 A main codeindex.phpcode file that handles all requestsstrongp  pThis method does not require that a codePHPcode file be created for each major task. Instead, each controller class that will be used in the system is registered on codeindex.phpcode with a unique class that I call codeRoutercode. The router decides if the specified Controller is legal or illegal and acts accordingly routes the browser to the correct controller. For example, a simplified version of the codeindex.phpcode scriptp  precodeltphp requireonce bootstrap.inc requireonce PATHLIBRARY . routerRouter.class.php  router  new Router routergtregisterUploader, PATHLIBRARY . controlUploader.class.php routergtregisterDetailsEditor, PATHLIBRARY . controlDetailsEditor.class.php routergtroute gt codepre  pThus, every action takes place at codeindex.phpcode. There is no need for a lot of files which dont do much else that instantiate a specific view and controller class. BUT, if you want to call scriptclass A from scriptclass B, then you need to pass the controller classs name along on the URL codeheaderLocation index.phpcontrollerDetailsEditorampimageid456code.p  pSo far, I dont really like the fact that I need to include the Controller name in the URL. I feel that it exposes too much of my underlying system to the enduser. But, I do like the fact that I can register all controller classes on one page. Mostly, I dont know if exposing the controller name is safe or not. One other annoyance is that, if I want to call on a script via POST requests, I have to include a hidden input that specifies the required controller class e.g. codeltinput typehidden namecontroller valueDetailsEditor gtcode.p  pI hope that is enough to go on. I am just nervous that the second method is not really going to serve me well in the months ahead. I have a small window of time soon to choose one or the other.p  pThankyou.p

Negative 197 pIm trying to create an endless animation of layer rotating slightly to the left, then slightly to the right and back. So Im animating 10 degress to the left, then 20 to the right, then 10 to the left again. It works great on simulator, but on device the layer shivers.

However, if i codeimport win32uicode, then it does not shutdown properly as explained in a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions4308346twistedgtkshutdownnotworkingproperlythis questiona .p  pThere are other problems. In the process of narrowing down my application to see what caused it to not shutdown, I came upon a point where I was deconstructing a logger class I had written that I had no problems with. In the constructor I had the linep  precodeself.logger  logger codepre  pI had commented out the rest of the class so codeself.loggercode was not even used.

This happened with various other lines of code in the logger class as well. I suspect it would happen with other random bits of code, too. But in any case  setting a variable that strongisnt even usedstrong should strongnotstrong cause any kind of problem. Note that at this point I was still using twisted with pygtk. I havent reproduced this yet with just gtk.p  pThis makes me suspect pygtk is being really unstable... has anybody come across this before Is there anything I can do The reason I updated from codegtk 2.12code was because my application would crash randomly, but this is far worse. p  pUPDATE The bugs happen on 64bit Windows 7.

Negative 197 pIm making a fighting game in Java for a project and trying to get a picture to move and be repainted across the panel reacting to the keyboard keyEvents.  Im trying to accomplish this by having a switch in the keyPressed method, while adding the keyListener to the panel.

The program compiles fine and all, yet nothing happens. I have no idea what is going wrong. It doesnt reach the breakpoint in the codekeyPressedcode method if I make one, nor will it it do a codeprintlncode if I put it in there. So the codekeyPressedcode method doesnt react at all.

Besides they are injected with different DomainService so entities bind with controls on view are different.p  pThe view model registers for some messages to keep track of the variation in other viewmodels it interacts, say a selection changed means the user wants to display other things in order to retrive data on DB.p  pThe problem is if I call view A and then view B I register for the same messages 2 times so Ive 2 operations on DB.p  pWhat I think correct is to dispose viewmodel bound to view A when I call view B generally when I close view A.

When the grid loads im getting View 1  7 of 7 and i can see 7 records, when Im applying a filter the output is View 1  3 of 4. Which means that 4 records match the filter but it keeps displaying only 3. Now if i clear the filters i get View 1  6 of 7, again one record is missing. I checked the table with firebug to see if the record is hidden but still nothing. I tried firefox, chrome, IE and in all browsers i get the same error. The jqgrid version is 4.1.1.

Negative 197 pstrongThe Scenariostrongp  pIm working on a large webformsheavy intranet site right now, and were trying to replace the 500 forms with a generic, databasedriven form engine which will dynamically add various fields and validation and wire up any dropdown bindings and so forth.  So far, so good.p  pHow we do this is fairly easy we have a routine called during page init which gets the appropriate field definitions and associated validators both client and custom and basically adds each in turn to a placeholder.  p  pAs part of the remit we need to create some composite controls for things like platform which have some specific serverside functionality that we cant really make generic, but which are used all over the place.  p  pThe plan was to simply extend the current design to add instances of these composite controls where required into the placeholder.p  pHowever, these controls do certain things on Load and PreRender which is where we have hit a problem.p  pstrongThe Problemstrongp  pRecall that were doing all of this in Init  Well, we need to in order to build in things like dynamic serverside custom validators whose method names we hold in the database and basically wireup using reflection after the associated control has been instantiated.p  pWe are quite able to add instances of our composite control this way, and all appears well.  However, when the controls Load or PreRender events are fired, we find a peculiar thing and this is where I need you clever people to help me out.p  pBasically, Im getting a NullReferenceException when I want to access any of the child controls on this composite control.  These are simple things like an image that I want to hide which is declarative on the .ascx and not dynamic and a dropdown list into which Id like to stuff some values from the database.  The strange thing is that even if I move this code out to PreRender, these controls dont appear to be instantiated even though they should be given that theyre declared, um, declaratively and were at the PreRender stage.  p  pHeres a typical fragment apologies, its in VB.NET 2.0 due to client restrictions thats just how it is p  precodeMe.EnsureChildControls IsRequiredFieldIndicator.VisibleIsRequired If Not IsPostBack Then     LoadDropDownListFromBLL End codepre  pThe exception occurs when we attempt to do something with any actual child control, such as the IsRequiredFieldIndicator control which is an image.  In other words, it aint there.  Oddly enough, when we inspect whats happening, the ChildControlsCreated property has been set to true yet the contents of the Controls collection shows nothing empty.  p  pIs there something fundamental that Im missing here  The composite control works perfectly in all regards if we place it declaratively on the page, so I am tempted to say that the problem might be related to some lesserknown characteristic of the page lifecycle as regards dynamically added composite controls.p  pOh, and before someone suggests it, I have ensured that the composite control implements the INamingContainer interface but to no avail.p  pHas anyone ever encountered something like this and, if so, how did you get around itp  pMany thanks,p  pJohnp

Negative 197 pIve created a wrapper around boostasioioservice to handle asynchronous tasks on the GUI thread of an OpenGL application. p  pTasks might be created from other threads so codeboostasiocode seems ideal for this purpose and means I dont need to write my own task queue with associated mutexes and locking. I want to keep the work done on each frame below an acceptable threshold e.g. 5ms so Im calling codepollonecode until the desired budget is exceeded, rather than calling coderuncode. As far as I can tell this requires me to call coderesetcode whenever new tasks are posted, which seems to be working well.p  pSince its short, heres the whole thing, sans codeincludecodep  pre classlangcpp prettyprintoverridecodetypedef stdfunctionltvoidvoidgt VoidFunc typedef stdsharedptrltclass UiTaskQueuegt UiTaskQueueRef  class UiTaskQueue   public      static UiTaskQueueRef create              return UiTaskQueueRef new UiTaskQueue            UiTaskQueue         normally just hand off the results of stdboostbind to this function     void pushTask VoidFunc f               mService.post f          mService.reset            called from UI thread defaults to 5ms budget but always does one call             void update const float ampbudgetSeconds  0.005f                getElapsedSeconds is a utility function from the GUI lib Im using         const float t  getElapsedSeconds         while  mService.pollone ampamp getElapsedSeconds  t lt budgetSeconds        private      UiTaskQueue       boostasioioservice mService  codepre  pI keep an instance of UiTaskQueueRef in my main app class and call codemUiTaskQueuegtupdatecode from within my apps animation loop.p  pId like to extend the functionality of this class to allow a task to be canceled. My previous implementation using almost the same interface returned a numeric ID for each task and allowed tasks to be canceled using this ID. But now the management of the queue and associated locking is handled by codeboostasiocode Im not sure how best to do this.p  pIve made an attempt by wrapping any tasks I might want to cancel in a codesharedptrcode and making a wrapper object that stores a codeweakptrcode to the task and implements the codecode operator so it can be passed to the codeioservicecode. It looks like thisp  precodestruct CancelableTask      CancelableTask stdweakptrltVoidFuncgt f  mFuncf      void operatorvoid const          stdsharedptrltVoidFuncgt f  mFunc.lock         if f              f                   stdweakptrltVoidFuncgt mFunc  codepre  pI then have an overload of my codepushTaskcode method that looks like thisp  precodevoid pushTask stdweakptrltVoidFuncgt f       mService.post CancelableTaskf      mService.reset  codepre  pI then post cancelable tasks to the queue usingp  precodestdfunctionltvoidvoidgt task  new stdfunctionltvoidvoidgt boostbindampMyAppdoUiTask, this  mTask  stdsharedptrlt stdfunctionltvoidvoidgt gt task  mUiTaskQueuegtpushTask stdweakptrlt stdfunctionltvoidvoidgt gt mTask   codepre  pOr with the codeVoidFunccode typedef if you preferp  precodeVoidFunc task  new VoidFunc stdbindampMyAppdoUiTask, this  mTask  stdsharedptrltVoidFuncgt task  mUiTaskQueuegtpushTask stdweakptrltVoidFuncgt mTask   codepre  pSo long as I keep the codesharedptrcode to codemTaskcode around then the codeioservicecode will execute the task. If I call coderesetcode on codemTaskcode then the codeweakptrcode cant lock and the task is skipped as desired.p  pMy question is really one of confidence with all these new tools is codenew stdfunctionltvoidvoidgt stdbind ...  code an OK thing to be doing, and a safe thing to manage with a codesharedptrcodep
Negative 197 pThe application I am working on is relying on Autofac as DI container and one of the reasons that made me decide to use it, among others, was the delegate factory feature see a hrefhttpcode.google.compautofacwikiDelegateFactories titleherehereap  pThis works fine for all cases where I need to recreate the same elements several times as is the case of some reports and related screens. Some reports even those of the same type are executed concurrently but they change only by their userdefined parameters so it makes sense I think to inject factories in order to create instances, passing the free parameters and leave the rest to the application.p  pThe problem comes with the fact that each report is made of a variable number of sub reports tasks and each task implements an ITask interface. Each report may have up to 50 different tasks to use and each task encapsulates a precise business operation. One option I have is to inject delegate factories for and create them when needed.p  pThese tasks have to be dynamically generated by factories and something likep  precodevar myTaskA  taskFactoryConcreteTaskA var myTaskB  taskFactoryConcreteTaskB var myTaskC  taskFactoryConcreteTaskC ... var myTaskZZ   taskFactoryConcreteTaskZZ codepre  prequires a lot of manual wiring delegates, constructor, backing fields etc while something like p  precodevar myTaskA  taskFactory.CreateltConcreteTaskAgt var myTaskB  taskFactory.CreateltConcreteTaskBgt var myTaskC  taskFactory.CreateltConcreteTaskCgt ... var myTaskZZ  taskFactory.CreateltConcreteTaskZZgt codepre  pwould be incredibly less work especially if the taskFactory wraps the container as shown in a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions1770113howdoiimplementadelegatefactorythis other posta, but also it would basically mean I am using a service locator to create my tasks.p  pWhat other options do I have that may be suitable to solve thisp  pNOTE there is a good chance I am completely off track and that I have to read a lot more about DI, in which case any contribution would be even more importantp

Negative 197 pI have a partial view that sometimes needs to collect data and sometimes just needs to display the saved data and not allow editing.p  pI would like to use the same partial view for both needs because the formatting is complex.  However, I dont want to just apply the disabled tag to specific controls  I want on the server side to render the readonly data as text, not as controls, so that it cant be posted back.p  pTo complicate things, there is one field, for comments, that can be edited even when all the other fields are readonly, so there will be a post back.  p  pIm thinking about a general solution to this problem.  The simplest thing to do would be to apply the following code pattern to all the fieldsp  precode ifcondition     Html.TextBoxFormodelgtmodel.Field  else      Html.DisplayFormodelgtmodel.Field   codepre  pBut thats inelegant and can lead to harder to read code.  Also, since the pattern has to be manually applied, it would be easy to make mistakes.  p  pI was toying with writing some extension methods to supplement TextBoxFor, et al, that would take an additional parameter that indicated whether to invoke TextBoxFor or DisplayFor.  p  pBut what Id like even better would be something that I could set on a containing element that would automatically affect how the child elements are rendered, the way you can set the Visible property on an ASP.NET WebForms Panel control.  p  pSo now Im treading out into the field of the hypothetical.  To achieve such a thing, I would need a serverside containing element perhaps following the same pattern as BeginForm that had awareness of its own scope and could affect how the rendering extension calls it contained were invoked.  p  pIs such a thing even possiblep

Negative 197 pThis is probably the easiest question to answer that you will find on stackoverflow, but I would like to get this confusion out of my head once and for all. Consider the following if statementp  precodeifx gt 0      echo Inside if   apparently there is a hidden else here....  echo This comes after if codepre  pAnd now consider the following onep  precodeifx gt 0      echo Inside if  else      echo Inside else   echo This comes after ifelse codepre  pIn the first example, if the condition evaluates to true, Inside if will be printed, but wont what comes after the if This comes after if get printed also I mean, I dont have return inside my if, so the code should continue normally, right. Same thing for the second if statement, whatever comes after the statement will get printed because the execution of the code will continue normally. Is there really a virtual else after an ifstatement if we dont explicitly define one I mean, if what comes after my if statement is printed whether the condition evaluates to true or not, then theres not really a virtual else after my if. Also, When is an Else absolutely necessary in an ifthenelse statement instead of just relying on the virtual else as in the first example Please shed some light on this.p  pThank youp

Negative 197 pSo I have an app that plays a bunch of songs while the user can flip through a comic book.  I use AVAudioPlayer and I have it set up to play the songs in a set order.

Negative 197 pI hope to get some assists from one of you. p  pMy problem is like this  Table one contains some network switch port configuration information. I fill each day all changes into this table to get a history.  This table will contain around 12000 lines. This table will grow about 1020 lines per day. The table has rows like this tblportconfig id, switchid, portid, portname, changedatep  pThe second table tblporterrors contains error statistics of all ports. This table will be updated every four hours and only ports with errors are inserted. The table looks like this id, date, switchid, portid, errorcounter1, errorcounter2, .p  pSo far so easy p  pI am looking now for an select statement which gives me all switches and ports of a specific time range. My problem is that I want to add the portname from tblportconfig in my query to make the output more user friendly.p  pLets say I want to look for the errors on switch 1 port 1 at  2012.03.29 and I want to get the port name from table tblportconfig and the error counter of that port on the period of time.p  pBut in my table tblportname the most current entry of that switch port has very often a date which is older than the date of the query.p  pIn addition it can happens that not the most current value is correct. Lets assume that we have for a specific switch and port following history of the port name 2012.03.01 name1 2012.03.02 name2 2012.03.08 name8 2012.03.29 name29p  pNow I want to get the error counter of the date 2012.03.07 for that port. The correct name for the date is name2 which should be included in the out put. Any ideas how I can solve thisp  pRegards, Andreas precode  phpMyAdmin SQL Dumpbr  version 3.4.10.1  p  h2 a hrefhttpwww.phpmyadmin.net relnofollowhttpwww.phpmyadmin.netah2  p Host localhostbr  Generation Time Mar 30, 2012 at 1104 AMbr  Server version 5.5.19br  PHP Version 5.3.8br SET SQLMODENOAUTOVALUEONZERO  p  h2SET timezone  0000h2  h2 Database codetestcodeh2  h2 Table structure for table codetblportconfigcodeh2  pCREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS codetblportconfigcode br   codeidcode int10 unsigned NOT NULL AUTOINCREMENT,br   codeswitchidcode int10 unsigned NOT NULL,br   codeportidcode int10 unsigned NOT NULL COMMENT decimal port id,br   codeportnamecode varchar32 NOT NULL,br   codechangedatecode date NOT NULL COMMENT Date when port config has been changed,br   PRIMARY KEY codeidcode  p  h2 ENGINEInnoDB  DEFAULT CHARSETlatin1 AUTOINCREMENT7 h2  h2 Dumping data for table codetblportconfigcodeh2  pINSERT INTO codetblportconfigcode codeidcode, codeswitchidcode, codeportidcode, codeportnamecode, codechangedatecode VALUESbr 1, 2, 0, , 20120101,br 2, 2, 0, name1, 20120115,  p  h23, 2, 0, name2, 20120119h2  h2 Table structure for table codetblporterrorscodeh2  pCREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS codetblporterrorscode br   codeidcode int11 NOT NULL AUTOINCREMENT,br   codedatecode datetime NOT NULL DEFAULT 00000000 000000,br   codeswitchidcode int11 NOT NULL,br   codeportidcode int11 NOT NULL,br   codeerrdiscardsc3code int11 NOT NULL,br   codeerrrxencincode int11 NOT NULL,br   codeerrrxencoutcode int11 NOT NULL,br   PRIMARY KEY codeidcode,br   KEY codedatecode codedatecode,br   KEY codeswitchidcode codeswitchidcode,br   KEY codeportidcode codeportidcodebr  ENGINEInnoDB  DEFAULT CHARSETlatin1 COMMENTTabelle mit allen error countern AUTOINCREMENT8   p  p  p  h2 Dumping data for table codetblporterrorscodeh2  pINSERT INTO codetblporterrorscode codeidcode, codedatecode, codeswitchidcode, codeportidcode, codeerrdiscardsc3code, codeerrrxencincode, errrxencoutcode VALUESbr 1, 20120113 200000, 2, 0, 150, 151, 152,br 2, 20120113 200000, 2, 1, 151, 151, 151,br 3, 20120113 200000, 2, 2, 152, 152, 152,br 4, 20120113 220000, 2, 0, 220, 220, 220,br 5, 20120113 220000, 2, 2, 222, 222, 222,br 6, 20120120 180000, 2, 0, 180, 180, 180,br 7, 20120122 140000, 2, 0, 140, 140, 140  p  ppre My select statement which I run looks like thisbr pre SELECT p.date, p.switchid, p.portid, p.errdiscardsc3, c.portname, c.changedate FROM tblporterrors p left join  tblportconfig c on p.switchid  c.switchid and p.portid  c.portid WHERE p.errdiscardsc3  0  prebr And will return lines like thisbr pre  p  pdate    switchid   portid errdiscardsc3 portname   changedate strongem20120113 200000  2   0   150  20120101emstrong 20120113 200000 2   0   150 name1   20120115 20120113 200000 2   0   150 name2   20120119 strongem20120113 220000  2   0   220  20120101emstrong 20120113 220000 2   0   220 name1   20120115 20120113 220000 2   0   220 name2   20120119 20120120 180000 2   0   180  20120101 20120120 180000 2   0   180 name1   20120115 strongem20120120 180000  2   0   180 name2   20120119emstrong 20120122 140000 2   0   140  20120101 20120122 140000 2   0   140 name1   20120115 strongem20120122 140000  2   0   140 name2   20120119emstrong pre p  pOnly the line in emitalicem are correct for SwitchID 2 and PortID 0.  p  pI want to get only a single row with the correct port name for each line which is in the table tblporterrors.br Please have a closer look at the different dates of emchangedateem and emdateem.br I am looking for the next oldest date compared to the date of the selected port error date.br I hope that you can understand my issue.

Negative 197 pI am try to create a search string to add the view pannel search property. I need to be able to search between 2 dates  from date and to date. The syntax that works is date equal to e.g. FIELD Form form AND FIELD dateCompleted  01012012 works OK. The dates are inputed into 2 input controls using a date picker or entered manually.  If the try  FIELD Form Form AND FIELD dateCompleted  01012012 AND FIELD dateCompleted lt 31012012 to search between the 2 dates, I get an error, or seach return no documents found. There are documents dateCompleted is datetime field, so should return dococuments. Any idea what the correct syntax should bep

Negative 197 pI am writing a simple photo viewer in C using gtkmm and I can not sort out how to set widget size.

Negative 197 pI have two separate sets of tables in the same database that model the exact same data but in different states. One is a live state, and the other is a staging state not test.

If the Environment is Live, then I pull from a different set of tables.p  pSo, normally with EF, I will get two separate models with different names.

Negative 197 pIm working on creating a JsonConverter for JSON.NET that is capable of serializing and deserializing expressions System.Linq.Expressions. Im down to the last 5 or so of the work, and Im having problems being able to run a LINQtoSQL query generated from the deserialized expression.p  pHere is the expressionp  precodeExpressionltFuncltTestQuerySource, Bundlegtgt expression  db gt      from b in db.Bundles     join bi in db.BundleItems on b.ID equals bi.BundleID     join p in db.Products on bi.ProductID equals p.ID     group p by b.First.Key codepre  pThis is a pretty straightforward grouping query in LINQtoSQL. codeTestQuerySourcecode is an implementation of codeSystem.Data.Linq.DataContextcode. codeBundlecode, codeBundleItemcode, codeProductcode, are all LINQtoSQL entities decorated with codeTableAttributecode and other other mapping attributes. Their corresponding datacontext properties are all codeTableltTgtcode properties as normal. In other words, nothing spectacularly notable here.p  pHowever, when I attempt to run the query after the expression has been deserialized, I get the following errorp  precodeSystem.Reflection.TargetInvocationException Exception has been thrown by the target of an invocation. gt     System.NotSupportedException The member ltgtfAnonymousType02[Bundle,BundleItem].bi has no supported translation to SQL. codepre  pI understand that this means that something the expression is doing cannot be translated to SQL by the LINQtoSQL query provider. It appears that it has something to do with creating an anonymous type as part of the query, like as part of the join statement.

The returned numbers arent massively off, but they are definitely incorrect.

Negative 197 pI want to create a javascript class based off the jquery ui datepicker functionality. I dont have much experience writing classplugin definitions in javascript so I am basically just basing this off some code ive seen on the web. p  pSo in the applications sometimes I only have to show one datepicker so Id like to just have a defaults option section just so the options dont have to be written in every file. That part works fine what I am struggling with is then if there are two id like to set an additional argument, in this case and onClose function.p  precodevar showfrom  new Date var showto  new Date function use strict  Datepick Instance      var Datepick  function  element, options          this.element  element        this.options  .extend, .fn.datepick.defaults, options             return this          .fn.datepick  function  options         var this  this       this.datepickeroptions         .fn.datepick.defaults          dateFormat yymmdd,        showAnim fadeIn,        minDate showfrom,        maxDate showto,        showOn both,        buttonImage imagescalendaricon.gif,          gotoCurrent true         .fn.datepick.Constructor  Datepick    window.jQuery    function    fromdate.datepickonClosefunctiontodate.focus    todate.datepick    codepre  pI also guessing that some of this is unnecessary I would just like a clean way to initialize the standard datepicker. Do I have to write a prototype for the Datepick as well I didnt think so because I am not really adding any functionality to the jqueryui class.p  pJSFiddle a hrefhttpjsfiddle.net4LmP915 relnofollowhttpjsfiddle.net4LmP915ap

Negative 197 pI have a view in my django project that fires off a celery task. The celery task itself triggers a few mapreduce jobs via subprocessfabric and the results of the hadoop job are stored on disk  nothing is actually stored in the database. After the hadoop job has been completed, the celery task sends a django signal that it is done, something like thisp  pre classlangpython prettyprintoverridecode tasks.py from models import MyModel import signals  from fabric.operations import local  from celery.task import Task  class HadoopificationTask     def runself, mymodelid, otherargs         mymodel  MyModel.objects.getpkmymodelid         self.hadoopifyfunctionmymodel, otherargs         signals.completesignal.send             senderself,             mymodelidmymodelid,             completeTrue,               def hadoopifyfunctionself, mymodel, otherargs         localhadoop jar usrlibhadoophadoopstreaming.jar D mapred.reduce.tasks0 file hadoopify.py mapper parsemapper.py 0 0 input usermeinput.csv output usermeoutput.csv codepre  pWhat is truly baffling me is that the django runserver is emreloadingem when the celery task is run, as if I had changed some code somewhere in the django project which I have not, I can assure you. From time to time, this even causes errors in the runserver command where I see output like the following before the runserver command reloads and is ok again note this error message is very similar to the a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions7435242weirdbehaviorcausesmyrunservertonotrespondproblem described herea.p  precodeUnhandled exception in thread started by ltfunction innerrun at 0xa18cd14gt Error in sys.excepthook Traceback most recent call last   File usrlibpython2.6distpackagesapportpythonhook.py, line 48, in apportexcepthook     if not enabled TypeError NoneType object is not callable  Original exception was Traceback most recent call last   File homerdmBizProjectsDaegisServerDevelopmenttarenvlibpython2.6sitepackagesdjangocoremanagementcommandsrunserver.py, line 60, in innerrun     runaddr, intport, handler   File homerdmBizProjectsDaegisServerDevelopmenttarenvlibpython2.6sitepackagesdjangocoreserversbasehttp.py, line 721, in run     httpd.serveforever   File usrlibpython2.6SocketServer.py, line 224, in serveforever     r, w, e  select.select[self], [], [], pollinterval AttributeError NoneType object has no attribute select codepre  pIve narrowed the problem down to when calls are made to hadoop by replacing codelocalhadoop ...code with codelocallscode which does not cause any problems with reloading the django runserver.

Negative 197 pSorry if theres already an answer for this, I searched for it and I didnt find exactly my scenario.p  pOnce again is a question like What is the fastestbest performance DB. But since the answer depends on the scenario, my scenario is this I want to write many logs to DB, thousands per second. But I will not read them often. Indeed 99,99 of them will never be read again, but once in a while I will need to read. Schema is not complex, just keyvalue. Once in a while I will read by value and I will not care at all if this read takes minutes. The correctness of the read will be critical, but not the performance.p  pSo far it seems the best solutions are things like MongoDB, Cassandra... and perhaps the best DynamoDBp

Negative 197 pMy question concerns classes design in OOP. Let say we have ItemBase which is parent class for Canceled, Modified and Added class. We also have DueToBase class  parent of Provider and Distributor.p  hr  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comKS67Q.png altsimple diagramp  hr  pItemBase may be changed due to DueToBase class. p  pAssume that ItemBase has property of type DueToBase, and DueToBase has interface method called compute. Compute algorithm is strongRELATEDstrong to the specific ItemBase derived class. So we have six different possible combinations of ItemBaseDueToBase relationship. p  pExample.p  precodeItemBase ib  new Added ib.changed  new Providerib ib.changed.compute codepre  pMy question is how should relationship between ItemBase and DueToBase be built in real object oriented programming  I do not see swichcase or if condition clause in compute method for checking which type of instance ItemBase is.  It gets even worse if DueToBase has another XXXBase class inside which has another interface method YYY which algorithm depends on the specific instance of DueToBase and even on the ItemBase.  How to deal with such cases  Is there any good programming pattern for such things  Maybe direction I followed is bad. I would appreciate for your assistance.p  pmaybe that my diagram was not clear. The problem is with following...  pseudocodep  precodedoSomething    ifitemBase instanceof Cancelled       ifdueToBase instanceof Provider          algorithm1       else ifdueToBase instanceof Company          algorithm2    else ifitemBase instanceof Modified       ifdueToBase instanceof Provider          algorithm3       else ifdueToBase instanceof Company          algorithm4    else ifitemBase instanceof Added       ifdueToBase instanceof Provider          algorithm5       else ifdueToBase instanceof Company          algorithm6      codepre  pit gets even worse with deeper if clauses.p

Negative 197 pNot sure if Im using the right terminology so this question may already be answered somewhere on stackoverflow if so, please let me know. Is there a way to designate multiple gravity points in a d3.js graph where the gravity point is one node with a fixed x,y value in each cluster For example, Im using the code from a hrefhttpbl.ocks.org2920551 relnofollowthis examplea to display clusters. The only difference in what my graphs will look like is that the nodes will have links to each other possibly to nodes in other clusters as well. I want to make sure the other clusters overlap as little as possible and still show any links between each cluster.p  pIve tried force.gravity0.1 with force.charge10. That seems to keep the clusters apart but the betweencluster distance continues to decrease as gravity increase because there is only one gravity point located in the middle of the graph by default.p

Negative 197 pIve put together a little app using Kendo UI that stores user inputs in a Javascript array, and then prints these items out by adding text to a div. Along with the text, I need to have a delete button to remove these items from the array. p  pSince Im adding the delete buttons to the DOM after I initialize Kendo UI, I assume I need to  use the code.kendoMobileButtoncode method on each button I add.

Negative 197 pI coded a Windows screensaver using CWinAPIs some time ago but now when I try it on Windows 8 at a logon screen when no users are yet logged in it doesnt seem to work. It is clearly a bug in Windows 8, because when I reboot the system my screensaver begins to work just fine. Note that this behavior never happened on any previous version of Windows.p  pWhat happens is that when the screensaver starts, the screen turns black and nothing happens after that moment. Obviously I cant debug it with the Visual Studio, so I added a trace statement into the first line where it should begin executing in WMCREATE in ScreenSaverProc but that line never gets called when the screensaver hangs up like I described above.p  pThis tells me that some initialization code hangs up before the WMCREATE message is sent, but to fix that I do not have access to that code because a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibrarycc14406628vvs.8529.aspx relnofollowMicrosofts tutorial on WinAPI screensaversa instructs to link to Scrnsave.lib or ScrnsavW.lib in my case.p  pSo I was wondering, is there any way to build a WinAPI screensaver without using Scrnsave.libp

Now this is what should happenp  p1 When visiting code....[...].test.web.comcode, check whether that directory exists. If not, try whether code..[...].test.web.comcode exists. So one level higher. Repeat step 1 in that case. So for example, when I visit codea.b.test.web.comcode, it will first check if codea.b.test.web.comcode exists, if exists, it will load that folder. If not, it will test for codeb.test.web.comcode, if that does not exists it will test for codetest.web.comcode which finally existsp  p2 When still no folder exists, use the codewebsitecode folder. So for example, when I go to codebla.web.comcode, it cannot find such a directory, so it will load codewebsitecode.p  pHow can I get this workingp
Negative 197 pShort description of our application We analyze .NET assemblies and detect dependencies between them e.g. method calls. We save those dependencies in a MSSQL server database. From a classmethod in code we can now find all direct and indirect dependencies and are able to find out which code may break if we change the interface or implementation.p  pAlthough we make good use of indices dropped our import performance, but that runs overnight anyways we still have performance issues. As we import many many versions of the same assembly we have quite a heavy amount of data and queries take a few seconds, which is just not fast enough lt 1.5s is the target.p  pAs dependencies are a graphlike structure were wondering if switching from MSSQL to a NoSQL graph database may help.

Negative 197 pI am trying to find the most optimized way to draw images in iOS on the iPad 3. I am generating a reflection for a third party version of coverflow that I am implementing in my app. The reflection is created using NSOperationQueue and then added via UIImageView in the main thread. Because the coverflow part is already using resources for the animations as you scroll through the images, with each new image that is added, there is a bit of a pop in the scrolling and it makes the app feel kind of laggyglitchy. Testing on iPad 1 and 2 the animation is perfectly smooth and looks great. p  pHow can I further optimize the drawing to avoid this. Any ideas are appreciated.

Negative 197 pHere is some representative code that gets the error Im experiencingp  precodeclass Data    class Table    virtual stdvectorltDatagt getData  0   virtual void putDataData dataItem  0   virtual Data getDataint index  0   class DerivedData  Data    class DerivedTable  Table    stdvectorltDerivedDatagt getData  return myData   invalid covariant return type   void putDataDerivedData dataItem  myData.pushbackdataItem    virtual DerivedData getDataint index  return myData[index]   invalid covariant return type    stdvectorltDerivedDatagt myData  codepre  pFirstly, I dont quite understand why it is that the override of putData is happy with the parameters being changed, but I cant change the return type for getData, although I appreciate this is something I can gain an understanding of from more reading.p  pSecondly, and my main question, how could this code be changed to make it work. My basic goal is to allow for multiple table like objects which will store and control data objects. While each data object will share some things in common, there will be some distinct differences which the table will control and work with. For example, one table might have data objects which have a name parameter, and so the table will provide a function which prints a list of all the names of the data it holds. This way I can have generic code which works with all of these table objects, and specialized code which operates only with one type of table.p

Negative 197 pIm writing a program in Python for which Im considering a local clientserver model, but I am struggling to figure out the best way for the server to communicate with the clients. A simple, canned solution would be bestIm not looking to reinvent the wheel. Here are my needs for this programp  ul liRuns on Linuxli liServer and clients are on the same system, so I dont need to go over a network.li liLatency thats not likely to be annoying to an interactive user.li liMultiple clients can connect to the same server.li liClients are started independently of the server and can connectdisconnect at any time.li liThe number of clients is measurable in dozens I dont need to scale very high.li liClients can come in a few different flavors ol liStream readers  Reads a continuous stream of data in practice, this is all text.li liState readers  Reads some state information that updates every once in a while.li liWriters  Sends some data to the server, receives some response each time.li olli ul  pClient type 1 seems simple enough its a unidirectional dumb pipe. Client type 2 is a bit more interesting. I want to avoid simply polling the server to check for new data periodically since that would add noticeable latency for the user. The server needs some way to signal to all and only the relevant clients when the state information is updated so that the client can receive the updated state from the server. Client type 3 must be bidirectional it will send usersupplied data to the server and receive some kind of response after each send.p  pIve looked at Pythons IPC page a hrefhttpdocs.python.org2libraryipc.html relnofollowhttpdocs.python.org2libraryipc.htmla, but I dont think any of those solutions are right for my needs.

Negative 197 pIn order to make the discussion clear, Im going to describe the problem in a very general manner, i.e. I will neither provide names of real classes nor will I describe the domaincontext however, I might if it turns out to be urgent.p  pImagine class codeAcode. Let this class have 2 strongimmutablestrong fields, for instance codexcode and codeycode please, notice, that these could be potentially strongbigstrong objects, i.e. inefficient to copy. Additionally, let these codexcode and codeycode be strongprimarystrong fields, i.e. only they are used in the implementation of codecodecodecode operators as well as hashcomputing function.p  pSince codeAcode is strongimmutablestrong in terms of codexcode and codeycode, the idea is to let multiple instances of codeAcode say codea1code and codea2code which have codea1.x  a2.xcode codea1.y  a2.ycode i.e. codea1  a2code to strongimplicitlystrong have shared access to those codexcode and codeycode, so that there is no unnecessary duplication.p  pMoreover, now imagine that there is another field in codeAcode codezcode, which is strongsecondarystrong and strongmutablestrong, and serves as a sort of behavior tweak for codeAcode. By design, it is desired to make this field shared among strongequalstrong instances of codeAcode strongtoostrong. So, if I invoke codea1.setZ...code this change will also affect codea2code because their access to codezcode is strongsharedstrong.p  pAs a result, we end up with a class codeAcode which has pure strongvalue semanticsstrong, but shares its members strongimplicitlystrong across equal instances. AFAIK such pattern is called a hrefhttpen.wikipedia.orgwikiFlyweightpattern relnofollowFlyweighta or strongaliasingstrong.p  pOne more detail before we move to the question. Most classes in the project are implemented using strongPimplstrong idiomp  precodeprivate   class Private    Private p codepre  pand class codeAcode is not an exclusion. Thats why the proposed idea of implementing the scheme described above is as follows.p  ol liUse strongshared pointerstrong to codeAPrivatecode instead of raw one in strongPimplstrong idiom li liHave global set of strongshared pointersstrong to codeAPrivatecodeli liIn constructor of codeAcode to check whether a strongshared pointerstrong to suitable codeAPrivatecode already exists in the set utilizing codexcode and codeycode of course, and if yes, then simply set codepcode to it, otherwise create new instance of codeAPrivatecode and store strongshared pointerstrong to it in this set, and similarly set codepcode to itli licodeAPrivatecodes destructor should remove strongshared pointerstrong to codethiscode from the set.li ol  pThis looks like the most straightforward and intuitive implementation. However, the problem is that since this global set holds a strongshared pointerstrong to codeAPrivatecode, it means that even when all instances of corresponding codeAcode are destroyed, the reference counter will stay on code1code, i.e. it will never reach code0code, and thus the memory is never freed.p  pI thought it would be good if some strongshared pointersstrong would offer a method to set lower bound for the reference counter. In this case, for example, I would simply set it to code1code which would mean that when it reaches code1code it frees the memory. Unfortunately, I havent found any implementation of such behavior in popular libraries Boost, Qt, Poco, etc.. Of course, I could do manual reference counting for my problem, but that just doesnt feel right and smells like reinventing the wheel.p  pProbably, there are other ways to solve this problem. Looking forward for your suggestions.p  pstrongNOTEstrong I would like to immediately intercept any advising to transform the problem to strongpointer semanticsstrong which I am well aware of. I need the solution exactly for the scheme described above.p

Negative 197 pWhats the conventional way to update a UI from within a threadp  pFor example I have a method within a class that handles a users login.

Update label on UI  codepre  pI dont want to include the code to update the UI within the method because the class itself is used in other projects, and by other team members on different projects.

Negative 197 pI would not ask this if my peculiar case had already been answered on this forum so please pardon my reasking.p  pI have a rails app which uses an sqlite3 database for development and it already contains all the data I need for the app. On pushing this app to heroku I was unable to view the app over there until I had to run heroku run rake dbmigrate. Now I can view the app, but I cant login in with admin accounts or do any other thing that requires data from the database. i already did all that is required I think as shown in my gem file belowp  precode    source httpsrubygems.org  gem rails, 3.2.12 gem bcryptruby gem kaminari gem gon . . . gem jqueryrails, 2.0.2  group development, test do   gem sqlite3, 1.3.7 end  group production do   gem pg, 0.12.2 end . . codepre  pI also tried heroku dbpush but that didnt help either. The main issue is that i am working on this app with someone else and we employ github for version control. But whenever I we get updates form each other our sqlite database always seems to empty itself. So to solve this problem we usually have to email the updated database directly to the other, who then proceeds to use it and replace the empty on in his local repo. I suspect that the reason why heroku rakedbmigrate is this. p  pBut giving as weve come this far in our development, we really cannot afford to start over. Is there a way we can populate the remote heroku database with the content of our local repo db Thanks for your responsesp

Negative 197 pMy question is largely about x86x64 code optimization, primarily on Windows if that makes a difference.p  pWhat learning resources would you recommend for someone who want to dedicate a fair amount of time about optimizations in the lowest levels possible Links, books, tools, APIs, all advice is recommended. It would also be nice if you wrote a very short description of why you recommend a particular link and maybe what I should expect to learn from it. p  pUltimately I hope at some point I get skilled in easily detecting performance bottle necks and understand emwhyem there is a bottle neck or emwhyem a particular function is stalling and hopefully realise emwhat options I have availableem to get rid of the bottle necks.p  pI have been coding for quite some time professionally but I feel I want to dedicate a fair portion of my time to learn optimization thoroughly. I understand Assembly language, C, C and how you can write code that is cache friendly by localizing data structures to avoid cache misses et.c. but I feel I overall lack much knowledge about fine tuning applications. I have used some profilers that help me indicate issues in various functions and I usually am able to get it more performable. But I dont know if the code still is performing worse than it should and I would like to learn to understand how to analyse the program in minute detail. p  pWhat I dont know is if emthis assembly instruction hereem is better or worse with emanother instruction thereem that could do the same job, nor if there is any way to easily detect functions or even instructions that are busy waiting for a particular process in the computer. My emrookieem impression that I accumulated through my years is that the problem is more complex than just looking at the instructions in isolation. This is probably because I dont fully understand subjects like speculative execution and other features. Heck, I dont even know what a clock cycle means to my instructions as I found out that 1 clock pulse doesnt correspond to 1 executed instruction. So that would also be something Id like to bridge my gap on.p  pIm a sort of person who picks a subject and then obsesses about it to the point it gets ridiculous. Some people may ask but emwhyem would you want to optimize something further than that Is it even a problem and the answer Id typically give is oh, it doesnt emhaveem to be faster than this. I just emwantem to make it faster, in order to learn more about it. I want to understand the system as totally as I can. p

This then appears to affect performance even though the node is not being displayed as the CCNode and other dependents are still somehow in the cocos2d system.p  pHeres the function that moves the CCNodep  precodeinterface CocosUtil  NSObject     typedef void NodeCompletionBlockCCNode sprite   void moveOperandCCNodeoperand throughCircleWithCentreCGPointcentreOfElipse      startingDegreesfloatstartingDegrees      endingAtDegreesfloatendingDegrees       startingRadiusfloatstartingRadius         endingRadiusfloatendingRadius  withInitialDurationccTimeinitialDuration     withMainDurationccTimeduration            clockwiseBOOLclockwise      completionBlockNodeCompletionBlockhandler  end   implementation CocosUtil   float angleFromDegreesfloatdeg      return fmodf450.0  deg, 360.0    Calculates the angle from one point to another, in radians.   float angleFromPointCGPointfrom toPointCGPointto      CGPoint pnormal  ccpSubto, from     float radians  atan2fpnormal.x, pnormal.y      return radians    CGPoint pointOnCircleWithCentreCGPointcenterPt andRadiusfloatradius atDegreesfloatdegrees      float x  radius  cos CCDEGREESTORADIANS[self angleFromDegreesdegrees]  radius     float y  radius  sin CCDEGREESTORADIANS[self angleFromDegreesdegrees]  radius     return ccpAddcenterPt, ccpSubCGPointMakex, y, CGPointMakeradius, radius    void moveOperandCCNodeoperand throughCircleWithCentreCGPointcentreOfElipse      startingDegreesfloatstartingDegrees      endingAtDegreesfloatendingDegrees       startingRadiusfloatstartingRadius         endingRadiusfloatendingRadius  withInitialDurationccTimeinitialDuration     withMainDurationccTimeduration            clockwiseBOOLclockwise      completionBlockNodeCompletionBlockhandler      float range      if clockwise  YES          if endingDegrees lt startingDegrees              range  360.0  endingDegrees  startingDegrees          else              range  endingDegrees  startingDegrees               else          if endingDegrees gt startingDegrees              range  360.0  startingDegrees  endingDegrees          else              range  startingDegrees  endingDegrees                    block float degrees  startingDegrees     block float radius  startingRadius      const float incrementAngle  10.0      float intervals  range  incrementAngle  1      ccTime interval  duration  intervals     float radiusStep  endingRadius  startingRadius  intervals      if clockwise  YES          degrees  incrementAngle      else          degrees  incrementAngle           radius  radiusStep      block void moveToNextPoint      moveToNextPoint  [         if fabsfdegrees  endingDegrees lt 1.0              [operand runAction[CCSequence actions                                 [CCEaseBounceOut actionWithAction                                  [CCMoveTo actionWithDurationinterval position[self pointOnCircleWithCentrecentreOfElipse andRadiusradius atDegreesdegrees]]],                                 [CCCallBlock actionWithBlock                                                                        if handler  nil                                           handleroperand                                                                        ],                                 nil]]          else              [operand runAction[CCSequence actions                                 [CCMoveTo actionWithDurationinterval position[self pointOnCircleWithCentrecentreOfElipse andRadiusradius atDegreesdegrees]],                                 [CCCallBlock actionWithBlockmoveToNextPoint],                                 nil]]              if clockwise  YES                  degrees  incrementAngle                  if degrees gt 360.0                      degrees  degrees  360.0                               else                  degrees  incrementAngle                  if degrees lt 0.0                      degrees  degrees  360.0                                            radius  radiusStep               copy]      [operand runAction[CCSequence actions                         [CCMoveTo actionWithDurationinitialDuration position[self pointOnCircleWithCentrecentreOfElipse andRadiusstartingRadius atDegreesstartingDegrees]],                         [CCCallBlock actionWithBlockmoveToNextPoint],                         nil]]    end codepre  pYoull note that the arc that the node is moved through is broken into 10 degree steps.

The line segments are precisely where they should be located, and there is no need for the final curve to be smooth.

So, once more, i need to find all mined fields with optimal number of opened fields. And of course i need a heuristic for my algorithm which will help to choose one of all safe unopened fields. And that list of safe unopened fields needs to be determined after every opening. So i need to call main function, that function will check did i find all mined fields, if not, then all safe adjacent unopened fields needs to be added to list of paths. And a path with best heuristic will be chosenp

Negative 197 pEdit 1 reduced the problem to a jsfiddlep  pI removed some unnecessary detail of the original problem.p  pI am trying to center a popup in the window. Because of how it will be used in the original context, the popups width will be dynamic. Its only contents will be text, but it wont be known how long that text will be. In most cases it will fit on one line, but if the text is longer and the user has a lower screen resolution, it may need to occupy 2 lines, and I would like to keep all the text on the screen. The text is static in the jsfiddle, so that is obviously not what is causing the issue. Im just clarifying in case anyone is wondering why I havent tried setting a width for the popup. Im using jquery to get the width using outerWidth and window.resize to trigger the centering function when the browser window is resized.p  pIt works fine as long as the popups width is smaller than the element containing it. I would like for the popup to just take the full width of its container if it is made small enough that the text has to go to two lines. As you will see in the video below, if you make a large adjustment in the browser window size, the width isnt always being reported correctly, which is causing the element to have a space on the left side instead of being centered. In other words, outerWidth is reporting a width different than what is being rendered by the browser.p  pSee this video for a demonstration of the problem a hrefhttpyoutu.beTnq6nrrDKvw relnofollowhttpyoutu.beTnq6nrrDKvwap  pThis is happening for me in Firefox, Chrome, IE, Opera, and Safari. Perhaps it is a problem with jquerys outerWidth function. Or perhaps I dont understand something about how it is supposed to work. Is there another method to accomplish what Im trying to dop  pHere is the javascript, nothing too complicatedp  precodefunction centerhorizontallyid      var windowWidth  document.documentElement.clientWidth     var popupWidth  id.outerWidth      var newleft  Math.max0, windowWidth2  popupWidth  2      ...      id.cssleft, newleft  px   function     window.resizefunction          centerhorizontallypopup           centerhorizontallypopup  codepre  pThe only important css is that the popup has position fixed and no set width or height. If I set the width of the popup, it sticks along the left side like it should, but the text extends beyond the right boundary. I would like to keep all the text on the screen and have it take the full width and jump some text down to the next line if needed. When the width gets low enough for that to happen, I just want the notice to occupy the entire width of the viewing area.p  pa hrefhttpjsfiddle.netdnagqHjVG5 relnofollowhttpjsfiddle.netdnagqHjVG5ap  pEdit 2 the solutionp  pThis is the solution I ended up using thanks to the help I got.p  pa hrefhttpjsfiddle.netdnagqHjVG44 relnofollowhttpjsfiddle.netdnagqHjVG44ap  pInstead of repositioning the popups, the popups are left with an auto width and display inlineblock. They are contained inside a div with fixed positioning. When the window is resized, the containing div is resized and repositioned. You can specify how much horiziontal space you want outside of the popups when the windows is reduced by changing the number in the function. There might be a way to do this with css only, but Im just happy to have something functional at the moment.p

Negative 197 pI am creating a custom segue to do custom animation page curl when pushingpopping a UINavigationController. The animation works fine except for the fact that its clipped to the boundaries of the UINavigationController.

Setting this views clipToBound to NO does the trick. However, since the view is most likely private and undocumented, it feels hackybrittle. Is there any other way to accomplish thisp
Negative 197 pI am playing with using generics to be able to restrict subtypes in a composite hierarchy, so that I could force different types at different layers of a hierarchy.p  pFor example having a BusinessDivisionDepartmentGroupPerson hierarchy, where the composite nodes at each level would only accept child nodes of the proper type the next lower level in the hierarchy. So I would construct the levels in the composite using generics at each level type instantiated to accept only nodes from the next lower level.p  pBut I get an error with the generics, and am not sure if it indicates a design error, or just something that java Generics cant do for me. The idea seems valid, I just want to restrict the types accepted by the add methods to only accept a subtype from the specific next level in the hierarchy to force the levels of structure. Since I am just lowering the upperbound on the type at each stage, all messages sent to the list would still be valid.p  pTop level node in the typical GOFComposite patternp  precode   public abstract class Business  ...  codepre  pComposite node hierarchy top levelp  precode  public abstract class Group extends Business       protected ListltBusinessgt subs       composite links     public Group addBusiness comp          subs.addcomp         return this      codepre  pSubsequent levels in the composite hierarchyp  precode public class ArealtT extends Businessgt extends Group       protected ListltBusinessgt subs       composite links      public AreaString title         supertitle         subs  new ArrayListltBusinessgt           Override     public Group addT comp       Error Here          super.addcomp         return this      codepre  pThe Error isp  blockquote precode Multiple markers at this line      The method addT of type ArealtTgt must override a superclass method codepre      p Name clash The method addT of type Area has the same erasure as addBusiness of type Group but does not override itp blockquote  pI tried a variation where I gave a similar type to the Groupadd method so they would have the same type signatures,p  ppublic  Group addT comp   ... p  pBut that fails similarlyp  blockquote precode Multiple markers at this line codepre      p The method addT of type Area must override a superclass method      overrides labs.composite.company.Group.add      Name clash The method addT of type Area has the same erasure as addT of type Group but does not override itp blockquote  pAm I missing something here TIAp  pPS Actually I think that this use of generics does not do exactly what I want anyway even if it did work, since i want to not only change the upperbound at each level, but require a specific single level in the type hierarchy, not any covariant argument type. I really would want something like, emfor any type T which is a subtype of Composite, accept only that type of object in the add methodem, I think that instead the generics says emaccept any object as an argument which is a subtype of Compositeem. I suppose that is impossible since arguments in Java are covariant, and LSP will always allow subtypes to be used.p

Negative 197 pI am having some problems reading data from a database in Matlab. The url link I use to download the data gives a semicolon delimited text file and I need Matlab to identify this data and arrange it accordingly in a codestructcode format since the data has different classes for example. I have already used codeurlreadcode and could download the data succesfully, the only problem is I am getting all the data as a character string inside one cell and I need to get this data as a table and well organized.p  pBasically I would like to know if it is possible to load data from a url into Matlab the same way the coderead.csvcode function in R does, where you just put the url where the file name should go and define how the data is delimited and viola, you get your codedata.framecode with all your data perfectly organized as it should.p  pI suppose there are ways to interpret the character string after using codeurlreadcode and convert it somehow into an organized codestructcode variable but there has to be a way to read it directly from the url as R does.p

Negative 197 pIm fairly new to Node.js and am having trouble understanding the way to go about loading libraries or files, in strongruntimestrong.  Apparently, it is a bad idea to load files in runtime using Node.jss native require function because it is blocking io, and therefore should not be used from within request handlers. So, Im assuming something like this is to be avoidedp  precodevar http  requirehttp.createServerfunctionreq, res     var file  require.pagesreq.url   res.end .listen8080 codepre  pstrongSo then is there a way to require files in runtime, in a nonblockingasynchronous waystrong p  pI dont think it would always be possible to load files in boot time rather than runtime because like in the example above, the only way to know what file to loadrequire is by getting the name through the codereq.urlcode property. p  pSo that seems like the only option. Unless, all the files in the folder are preloaded and then called upon by name, in the callback By using codefs.readdirSynccode or something to iterate through all the files in the folder and compare the gotten files names to the codereq.urlcode property, but that seems wasteful. Preloading all the files in the folder maybe around 50 files and then only using 1 of them, doesnt seem like a good idea. Am I wrongp  pEither way, I would just like to know if there is a way to require files in runtime in a better, nonblockingasynchronous way.p  pThank youp

Negative 197 pSay i have many tables in database that contain strongnumeric idstrong e.g. fields strongusertypestrong, stronguserstatusstrong, strongusercurrencystrong etc.p  pnow i do have to display this information along other info on my pages of my website, say i have 10 pages where some of above info will be printedp  pstrongMETHOD 1strong when i write query i do something likep  precodeSELECT ...        userstatus        ...

All has to be done is add new line in database table statuses oncep  pHowever with second method i have now about 10 tables in database that just contain the numerical id descriptions strongtbluserstatuseds, tblcurrencynames, tblusersexstrong etc.p  pstrongMETHOD 3strong i wonder would it be a good practice to use once table to store this ids E.g.p  pstrongtblidlabelsstrong p  precode    id    idtype  idnumber  idlabel     421        2        1        New User          422        2        2        Application Accepted     423        2        3        Payment received     424        8        1        USD     425        8        2        EURO     426        5        1        Male     427        5        2        Female     ... codepre  pThen i just do same as method 2 except i left join this table based on idnumber e.g.p  precodeSELECT ...        tblidlabels.statusname        ...     FROM users         LEFT JOIN tblidlabels ON tblidlabels.idnumber  users.userstatus AND tblidlabels.idtype  2             WHERE userid  5 codepre  pThis way i only have one table with all labels for numeric ids i have in my system. If i have to add one in the future its not too difficult, all that matters is strongidtypestrong  and strongidnumberstrong, field strongidstrong is just for compatibility.p  pDo you see any problem with third method, or can you advice better approachp

Using EXPLAIN, I get using index condition, which is good. I think I understand why the index works, since the same two indexed columns exist in the WHERE and ORDER BY clauses.p  pMy problem is with queries that ORDER by codeplayscode or coderatingcode. I understand Im introducing a third column, but for the life of me I cant get an index that works well, despite trying just about every variation I could think of composite indexes of all three or four in every order, and so on. Maybe the query could be written differentlyp  pI should add that coderatingcode and codeplayscode are always queried as codeDESCcode. Only codedatepublishedcode may be either codeDESCcode or codeASCcode.p  pAny suggestions greatly appreciated. TIA.p

Negative 197 pI am completely confused by the notion of the use of URL for routing and just dont understand if there is a conflict between the two concepts as I see them, or what I should do to prepare my development to using them.p  pThe two concepts are URL routing to determine front end rendering  la backbone.js and backend routing as a means to provide an API service. The conflict is if they are on the same domain.p  pFor example lets say I plan Front End routing like this A framework such as backbone.js uses routing in order to determine which actions to perform to render templates to the user. For example a url codehttpwww.mydomain.comcategoriescode is the route to render a list of categories in a template.p  pHoweever, it needs to get the list of categories from a backend service on the same domain in order to populate the model and handle changes to data. So I plan to be able to POST, UPDATE, DELETE etc...p  pSo this is where I get confused. If I create a API service on codehttpwww.mydomain.commanagecategoriescode how does the front end framework know not to throw an error because I havent defined that routep  pAnd further what am expected to deal with in terms of error handling or not if I was just to update the URL manually and hit enterp  pI just cant get my head round this.p

In particular, we can Dispose a whole portion of the hierarchy when the player quits a level, which is far easier than having components rebuild complex data structures to adjust to the idea that theyre now in a completely new level.pli ul  pDrawbacksp  ul lipAs Mark Seeman points out, a hrefhttpblog.ploeh.dk20100203ServiceLocatorisanAntiPatternService Locator is an AntiPatterna.pli lipSome components would instantiate service providers purely because emI the programmer know that nested components need that serviceem, or emI the programmer know that the game has to have e.g. AI running in the game worldem, not because the instantiator requires that service per se.pli ul  h2Goalh2  pIn the spirit of DI, I would like to remove all knowledge of service locators and scopes from Components. So they would receive via DI constructor parameters for each service they consume. To keep this knowledge out of the components, the composition root will have to specify, for each componentp  ul liWhether instantiating a specific type of component creates a new scopeli liWithin that scope, which services are available.li ul  pI want to write the intuitivep  precodeclass AIComponent      public AIComponentIAudioService audio, IShootingService shooting, INavigationService navigation              ...       codepre  pAnd be able to specify in the composition root thatp  ul liIAudioService is implemented by the Audio class and you should createobtain a singleton I can do thisli liIShootingService is implemented by ShootingComponent and there should be one of those createdobtained per Screenli liINavigationService as per IShootingServiceli ul  pI must confess Im completely lost when it comes to the latter two. I wont list my numerous abortive autofacbased attempts here as Ive made a few dozen over a long period and none of them were remotely functional. I have read the documentation at length  I know lifetime scopes and codeOwnedltgtcode are in the area Im looking at, but I cant see how to transparently inject scoped dependencies as Im looking to  yet I feel that DI in general seems supposed to facilitate exactly what Im looking to dop  pIf this is sane, how can I achieve this Or is this just diabolical If so, how would you structure such an application making good use of DI to avoid passing objects around recursively, when the lifetimes of those objects vary depending on the context in which the object is being usedp

My hunch tells me its some versioning issues with the JDO dependencies, but I cant seem to figure it out. p  pstrongTestJerseyService.javastrongp  pre classlangjava prettyprintoverridecodePathservice public class TestJerseyService       GET     Pathtest     ProducesMediaType.APPLICATIONJSON     public Person testMethod          PersonDaoImp dao  new PersonDaoImp         return dao.addPerson       codepre  pstrongPersonDaoImp.javastrongp  pre classlangjava prettyprintoverridecodepublic class PersonDaoImp  public Person addPerson     PersistenceManager pm  PMF.get.getPersistenceManager     Person p  new Person     p.setNameTestName      try          pm.makePersistente       finally          pm.close          return p  codepre  pstrongPMF.javastrongp  pre classlangjava prettyprintoverridecodeimport javax.jdo.JDOHelper import javax.jdo.PersistenceManagerFactory  public final class PMF      private static final PersistenceManagerFactory pmfInstance          JDOHelper.getPersistenceManagerFactorytransactionsoptional      private PMF       public static PersistenceManagerFactory get          return pmfInstance       codepre  pstrongPerson.javastrongp  pre classlangjava prettyprintoverridecodeimport javax.jdo.annotations.IdGeneratorStrategy import javax.jdo.annotations.Key import javax.jdo.annotations.PersistenceCapable import javax.jdo.annotations.Persistent import javax.jdo.annotations.PrimaryKey   PersistenceCapableidentityType  IdentityType.IDENTITY public class Person       PrimaryKey     PersistentvalueStrategy  IdGeneratorStrategy.IDENTITY     private Key key      Persistent     private String name      public Person           public String getName          return name           public void setNameString name          this.name  name      codepre  pstrongjdoconfig.xmlstrongp  pre classlangxml prettyprintoverridecodeltxml version1.0 encodingutf8gt ltjdoconfig xmlnshttpjava.sun.comxmlnsjdojdoconfig     xmlnsxsihttpwww.w3.org2001XMLSchemainstance     xsischemaLocationhttpjava.sun.comxmlnsjdojdoconfig httpjava.sun.comxmlnsjdojdoconfig30.xsdgt      ltpersistencemanagerfactory nametransactionsoptionalgt         ltproperty namejavax.jdo.PersistenceManagerFactoryClass             valueorg.datanucleus.api.jdo.JDOPersistenceManagerFactorygt         ltproperty namejavax.jdo.option.ConnectionURL valueappenginegt         ltproperty namejavax.jdo.option.NontransactionalRead valuetruegt         ltproperty namejavax.jdo.option.NontransactionalWrite valuetruegt         ltproperty namejavax.jdo.option.RetainValues valuetruegt         ltproperty namedatanucleus.appengine.autoCreateDatastoreTxns valuetruegt         ltproperty namedatanucleus.appengine.singletonPMFForName valuetruegt     ltpersistencemanagerfactorygt ltjdoconfiggt codepre  pstrongpom.xml snippetsstrongp  pre classlangxml prettyprintoverridecodeltdependencygt          ltgroupIdgtcom.google.appengineltgroupIdgt          ltartifactIdgtappengineapi1.0sdkltartifactIdgt          ltversiongt1.8.8ltversiongt       ltdependencygt       ltdependencygt          ltgroupIdgtcom.google.appengine.ormltgroupIdgt          ltartifactIdgtdatanucleusappengineltartifactIdgt          ltversiongt2.0.1.1ltversiongt       ltdependencygt       ltdependencygt          ltgroupIdgtjavax.jdoltgroupIdgt          ltartifactIdgtjdoapiltartifactIdgt          ltversiongt3.0.1ltversiongt       ltdependencygt       ltdependencygt          ltgroupIdgtorg.datanucleusltgroupIdgt          ltartifactIdgtdatanucleuscoreltartifactIdgt          ltversiongt3.0.11ltversiongt          ltscopegtruntimeltscopegt       ltdependencygt       ltdependencygt          ltgroupIdgtorg.datanucleusltgroupIdgt          ltartifactIdgtdatanucleusapijdoltartifactIdgt          ltversiongt3.2.7ltversiongt       ltdependencygt        ltplugingt             ltgroupIdgtcom.google.appengineltgroupIdgt             ltartifactIdgtappenginemavenpluginltartifactIdgt             ltversiongt1.8.8ltversiongt          ltplugingt          ltplugingt             ltgroupIdgtorg.datanucleusltgroupIdgt             ltartifactIdgtdatanucleusmavenpluginltartifactIdgt             ltversiongt3.2.0releaseltversiongt             ltconfigurationgt                ltapigtJDOltapigt                ltpropsgtbasedirdatanucleus.propertiesltpropsgt                lt ltlog4jConfigurationgtbasedirlog4j.propertiesltlog4jConfigurationgt gt                ltverbosegttrueltverbosegt             ltconfigurationgt             ltexecutionsgt                ltexecutiongt                   ltphasegtprocessclassesltphasegt                   ltgoalsgt                      ltgoalgtenhanceltgoalgt                   ltgoalsgt                ltexecutiongt             ltexecutionsgt          ltplugingt codepre  pstrongWhen I hit the servicetest endpoint I get this errorstrongp  precodeHTTP ERROR 500  Problem accessing exercisestest.

Negative 197 pSo Ive been reading a lot of articles that have been discouraging the use of Application.DoEvents and even saying that it should never be used but I cant seem to find a good alternative for my scenario...  The application that I am working on has a method that is called by a this.Shown event when the main GUI form first launches. The method does some work that takes about a minute of time so the same method also creates a form that is essentially a custom made progress bar.

Negative 197 pI am trying to pull from a database in which whoever developed the database defined a column as a codestringcode when the only data thats in the column is scientific notation so it should have been defined as an codeintcode.

Negative 197 pMy First question on here so be kind...p  pI am writing an aerodrome simulator in as2, I need to calculate a turn rate between 2 points so that the aircraft turns nicely. I have tried a few things but the maths forums on this type of subject use complex calculations and I struggle to understand them. I need an answer in a more variable specific format.p  pI have the XY of both tile and target, the speed of tile and the distance of target from the tile.p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comxAPzs.png altTurn Examplep  pI use vector math, with frame time calculations to move the tile. I already have a good calculation for shortest turn i.e. left right.p  pI need to calculate the turn rate required to go from point a to point b in a nice fluid motion and turn the tileaircraft in a nice fashion.p  pAny help would be much appreciated.p

Negative 197 h2Goalh2  pTo verify if a user has access to write  delete files on a specific network folder. For examplep  pcodeMyCompanyDepartmentDocumentCentercode is the directory where all the files are stored for the document center program. If a user has access to this folder, he is able to add  edit  delete files. If not, an error is caught by my trycatch.p  hr  h2Current Solutionh2  pI have attempted to solve this by setting up a trycatch right before the user deletes the file. If the user encounters an error, he will get a message saying that he does not have access... I find this rather trivial and would like a more concrete way of determining if the user has access to this folder.p  hr  pHow do I verify if a user has access to this specified folderp
Negative 197 pI have an access database originally written in 2010 but has been updated to 2013 with specific VBA code to format a word document. The database is located on a shared network and I have some users with Access 2013 and some users with 2010.  How do I make the database reference ONLY use the 2010 reference libraries  Or have it reference only specific reference libraries The Microsoft office 14 object reference libraries work in both 2010 and 2013. But of course the version 15 object reference libraries do not.  the obvious answer is to upgrade everyone, which is slowly being done, but I have some users going through a legacy citrix server that cannot be upgraded. p  pI am new to VBA coding, and I think late binding  code will work, but I am not sure how to go about creating it and where is the best place to put the code.  The letter must be formatted in a specific format based on our Divisions specifications.  p  pthis also my first postso please let me know if I need to explain the problem in more detail.  Below is the code to open the letter, make sure it is formatted correctly and has the needed fields from the database. p  precodePrivate Sub btnGenLetterClick  This part just makes sure required info is filled in and prompts user to fill in if not If you want to use this, of course you will have to substitute the correct path and name of the fields being checked.

looks like T1 does not take any gap locks and only locks the inserted record. This is expected under READCOMMITTED isolation level. T2 on the other hand, takes three locksp  ul liX lock on a primary key record expectedli liX lock on a secondary key record for u10 expectedli liS lock on a secondary key record following u10, which is in this case u20 unexpectedli ul  pSo the problem seems to be that MySql takes an extra shared lock on a next record in a unique index. Any ideas whyp  h2Questionh2  pThe text below is not entirely accurate, see update abovep  pWhy is T2 trying to obtain a shared lock on an index record 20 in codeucode that T1 inserted It doesnt seem like T2 is trying to touch that record at all. My understanding is that T1 takes an exclusive lock on 20 and a intension gap lock on 10, 20. T2 should only take an exclusive lock on 10.p  pThis also does not happen if the index on codeucode is not unique.p  pMySQL version is code5.5.350ubuntu0.12.04.2code but I observe the same behavior with 5.6.p  pThanksp

I then want to count the amount of SKUs for that day, and add the quantity of SKUs for that day. So I drag the SKU column into the values section and make sure that COUNT is selected. I then drag the Quantity column into the value section, and when I select SUM, my values wind up being zero.

Negative 197 pI hope I can explain this correctly....p  pI have this table p  precode[InspectionSchedule] [smallint] NULL, [NeedsAssesment] [smallint] NULL, [DateLastInspected] [datetime2]7 NULL, codepre  pand lets say codeDateLastInspectedcode is code20100101 000000.0000000code globally.p  pcodeInspectionSchedulecode has values that are 1, 5, or 10 and represents so many years when an asset must be inspected. p  pIm hoping for help with a simple query that will take codeDateLastInspectedcode, add the value of codeInspectionSchedulecode to it, and return a Year, n years in the future. I know this is done with a CAST operator, but I get lost from there. p  pHeres where it gets tricky Instead of a date n years in the future, we just need a year, N years in the future, based on Fiscal Year Oct 1. For example, if an asset was inspected on code20100730 000000.0000000code, which is FY 09, and was on a 5year inspection cycle, then this math would return the next inspection year as 2014. I hope this make sense. Im sure this is a simple matter of joining a bunch of CASTS and DATEPARTS, but I dont even know where to start. p

Negative 197 pWhen using Html.ValidationSummary and Html.BeginForm, you typically reload or navigate away from the page when all fields validate and the controller can perform the next steps.  In this situation, there is no need to clear the validation summary.p  pHowever, when using Ajax.BeginForm the user might never leave the page.  Once the form is validated, control goes to the controller live above but the controller may send the user back to the calling form as some serverside validation needs to be addressed.  In this situation, an apparent bug in .NET does not clear the ValidationSummary.  Yes, I can hideclear it via JavaScriptJQuery using the OnBegin property of the form, but then it never unhides if its needed on the form at a later step, say when you invalidate the client side validation.p  pA snippet of my formp  precodeusing Ajax.BeginFormExistingLogin, Home, null, new AjaxOptions  HttpMethod  Post, OnBeginonBegin, OnSuccess  onSuccess, OnFailure  onError , new  class  formhorizontal, role  form       Html.AntiForgeryToken     Html.ValidationSummaryPlease correct the following errors, new  class  alert alertdanger, role  alert      ltdiv idcontrollerResponse classalert alertdanger rolealert styledisplaynonegtltdivgt codepre  pHow do you handle thisp

Negative 197 pI have a fairly basic one activity  preferences Android app that uses the codeMediaPlayercode.p  pIn a nutshell, the app starts with codeMainActivitycode inflated, and when the user touches a certain button, a MediaPlayer is initialized from codeinitializeMediaPlayercode using codenewcode the first time, coderesetcode after that, followed by codesetDisplaycode, codesetDataSourcecode, codepreparecode, and codesetLoopingcode. Once the Media Player has been initialized, and some other conditions met, I call a triggerAlarm method that basically calls codemMediaPlayer.startcode. When the button from above is touched again, I call codemMediaPlayer.stopcode.p  pInside codeonDestroycode I call codemMediaPlayer.releasecode, which puts my instance of the codeMediaPlayercode in the End state. My problem is that once I do that, I cant use the MediaPlayer again  when I start the app again, mMediaPlayer is still in the End state, so I cant coderesetcode it I tried doing codemMediaPlayer  new MediaPlayercode instead of coderesetcode, but that didnt work either I think the app got the object references mixed up, because I would be able to start the media playback, but not stop it. And at this point I cant think if any solution, clumsy or not, that would work other than not codereleasecodeing the codeMediaPlayercode, but this strikes me as a bad idea, even with the really short and small raw resource file I need to play.p  pstrongEDITstrong Relevant code and a hrefhttppastebin.comBB98MrHY relnofollowlogcatap  precode All of this happens in MainActivity private MediaPlayer mMediaPlayer Override protected void onDestroy      if  mMediaPlayer  null ampamp mMediaPlayer.isPlaying          mMediaPlayer.stop     mMediaPlayer.release     super.onDestroy    Called on button click if the device is unlocked private void deviceLock       Code to register this activity as listener for sensor changes     initializeMediaPlayer    Called on button click if the device is locked private void deviceUnlock       Code to unregister this activity as listener for sensor changes     if  mMediaPlayer.isPlaying          mMediaPlayer.stop   private void initializeMediaPlayer      if  mMediaPlayer  null          mMediaPlayer  new MediaPlayer     else               This is where I tried to have a trycatch block in which I would try to          call reset, and if that threw an IllegalStateException I would          do mMediaPlayer  new MediaPlayer         mMediaPlayer  new MediaPlayer            setDisplay        setDataSource        prepare        Catch exceptions    public void onSensorChanged SensorEvent event        If certain conditions are met, call triggerAlarm     triggerAlarm   private void triggerAlarm      try              if  mMediaPlayer.isPlaying              mMediaPlayer.start          catch IllegalStateException ise               Should never happen because triggerAlarm can only be called after deviceLock           and deviceLock already initializes the media player, but still...          initializeMediaPlayer       codepre  pSo to get the crash, I wouldp  ul liStart the appli liHit the button to call codedeviceLockcode, which is going to either run codenew MediaPlayercode if this is the first run or call coderesetcode if its not.

Negative 197 pI am building a survey application. Where I am stuck now is that my client needed to create a printout of the final report made on the basis of survey.

However, if you go through the code very carefully, you can see that in fact the order of evaluation IS specified. The GCC compiler is evaluating codex,increment,MAXx, incrementcode from the codeprintfcode method righttoleft, while the LLVM compiler is evaluating this code lefttoright. Does anyone know why this is the case Shouldnt something like the order of evaluation of codeprintfcode be clearly defined and the same for both compilersp  pAlso, I just want to clarify that this code is from a tutorial and is aimed at understanding how the C language works. Its purpose is not to be a program that works properly or to have output that is accurate. The wacky output is intentional and so is the use of a silly macro like the one used in the code MAX. Im only trying to understand why there is such a big difference here, thanks p

This practice problem isp  p1Ask the user how many people he wants to enter into the list.p  p2Read 3 strings, then turn that info into a student class and put the student inside a vector.p  p3Sort the list by name. Extra credit would be to sort the list by Student IDp  p4Print the info of each student in the list.p  p5Ask user while answer is Y, search the list for a name and print the info correlating to the namep  pWhile in Java, this seems pretty easy, Im having an extremely hard time understanding what is going on in C. p  pI currently only have 1, 2, 4 and 5 done. This is what I have so far.p  precodeinclude ltiostreamgt include ltstringgt include ltvectorgt include ltalgorithmgt include ltsstreamgt include ltfstreamgt include ltiomanipgt  using namespace std  class Student      string myName, myStudentID, myClassID public     Studentstring name, string studentID, string classID              myName  name         myStudentID  studentID         myClassID  classID           string getName  return myName      string getStudentID  return myStudentID      void printInfo  cout ltlt myName ltlt setw15 ltlt myStudentID ltlt setw10 ltlt myClassID ltlt endl       int main      int num     stdvectorltStudentgt studentList     cout ltlt How many students do you wish to add to the student list   ltlt endl     cin gtgt num       cin.ignore     for int a  0 a lt num a               string inputName, inputStudentID, inputClassID         get name         cout ltlt Please enter the Student name           getlinecin, inputName           get student ID         cout ltlt Please enter the Student ID number           getlinecin, inputStudentID           get class ID         cout ltlt Please enter the Student class ID           getlinecin, inputClassID            Student thisStudentinputName, inputStudentID, inputClassID         studentList.pushbackthisStudent          cout ltlt endl           sortstudentList.begin, studentList.end          I never figured out how to sort the list by name.

Negative 197 pWe have a custom class library that has been built from the ground up that performs a variety of functions that are required for the business model in place. We also use VBA to automate some data insertion from standard Microsoft packages and from SolidWorks.p  pTo date we have basically rewritten the code in the VBA application macros, but now are moving to include the class library into the VBA references. Weve registered the class library for COM interop, and made sure that it is COM visible. The file is referencable, we have added the codeltClassInterfaceClassInterfaceType.AutoDualgt code tag above each of the Public Classes, so that intellisense works.p  pWith that said, the problem now arises  when we reference the class library, for this instance lets call it codeTestObjectcode, it is picked up and seems to work just fine.

Negative 197 pI was using Raphael for creating SVG shapes and images, but the data is retrieved from my server so it is all variable.  With JSTL foreach I create multiple Raphael objects.p  pFor my next task I am implementing dragging of objects and selecting, etc. for that I have found JQuery UI as a perfect fit for all of my requirements.p  pThe issue is Im trying to figure out how to work with my raphael shapes.p  pI found a post on here about it but it was an example creating the raphael within a Jquery function call which then used a div and an id for the single raphael shape.p  pa hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions3613636usingjquerywithraphaelUsing JQuery with Raphaelap  pI am looking to use multiple, I am wondering how to do this  p  pI also found another topic which talks about JQuery SVG as well as something called SnapSVG.p  pa hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions588718jquerysvgvsraphaelrq1jQuery SVG vs. Raphaelap  pIt seems to me the best approach would be to use JQuery SVG, but that means I would have to recode some things, which I rather not do, but will do is I have to.p  pIt seem that JQuery SVG has some issues with working with IE that are code changes, but the code itself seems very old, so Im not sure if its outdated or whatp  pIt also seem like its a bit more code and looks like it could be confusing to someone who is new to JQuery like myself.p  pI have tried including  with ids into my JSTL loops but am met with a weird suggestion on Netbeans saying to put a  after div.p  pIt didnt work either way.p  pI tried creating multiple Raphael functions and have the JSTL loop first, then create divs for each, and then scripts, but that didnt work really produced 1 face that was movable, nor does the code seem that clean.p  pBefore the above happened I originally had copied my code from the main section and my for loop was in its original spotinstead of moving it to the outside with creating new divsscripts etc as I mentioned above it produced all the faces in place, but they were all part of 1 div, which all moved together.p  pSo I feel that I am kind of on the right track, but am having an issue with moving all of these elements...p  pThoughtsp  pThanks youp  pEDIT 1  I was able to drag each object by itself, but the issue I am having now is that I have created a new paper for each Raphael.  I need to find out how to reuse the same and hopefully be able to use the Rapahel Elements Ids to work with the div ids, because normally the paper id is connect to the div id.p  pEDIT 2  Using the same paper doesnt work since I need to drag individual objects.  I had tried setting the id of each element but that didnt work, nor setting element.node.setAttributeid,name from the above example, to which I see its still relating directly to the paper id.p  pI tried to set a new paper to my element sizes, or even a little bit bigger, in the spot they are supposed to be in, but no go.  I am not sure why creating the new paper causes my canvas to go crazy.p  pWill continue to update as I figure out more, thanks.p  pEDIT 3  It was very late while doing this originally, so here is a new edit a couple days later.p  pI realize that by setting the new paper to the new position, I had to set the new rectangle I was creating to 0,0 for x,y.  This caused all of the retancles to act like a staircase through the looping, which was odd.p  pI think Im just going to use JQuery SVG, as I was thinking of, but I thought there was some complications, and it looked unsupported.p  pI seem to not be able to do this, so I will just switch to using Jquery fully as everything else I am using is Jquery.p

Negative 197 pI have 3 long running tasks that I need to synchronize on.  They are independent, but the calling thread must wait until all three are finished before continuing.p  pI can create an agent for each task, and await on them, but agents arent really the right semantic construct, since each agent will only be be called once.  p  pWhat I really want is to await on 3 futures, or some approach that more closely resembles what Im trying to achieve.p  pCan I await on futures instead of agentsp  pEditp  pI guess the answer is just simply to deref each future in the calling thread in a loop, which will block until theyve all returned.

Negative 197 pIm getting confused between what Im reading about Recipient Limits within Exchange 2013.  Quite often Ive seen it said that there is a 100 recipient limit for an email send through Exchange which is confirmed through testing where 101 recipients cause an email to be failed for delivery well more importantly it sorta just vanishes without an NDR.  I did a getmailbox   fl name, emrecipem and this showed that all mailboxes were set to unlimited thus throwing further confusion into the works.p  pHaving looked at GetTransportConfig emrecipem I did notice a parameter called TransportRuleCollectionAddedRecipientsLimit which was set to 100 but the Microsoft website says this is an internal use only flag.p  pThe problem  Well, this customer has just been upgraded from Exchange 2000 where they used to send to around 1,500 people in one email using BCC.  Having read online about the posibility of 100 recipient limits, I suggseted they send in chunks.  This week, however, even that stopped working and GetMessageTracking is showing only the To which is always set to the same user account and one hotmail address which was the last in the list. If I hadnt seen the screenshot of the email in Outlook myself, I would have doubted the BCCs had been entered properly.p  pWhich logs do I need to look at to see where Outlook submitted the message to ensure the recipients where entered and what has removed them from being processed  This is on a single Exchange server with both Client and hub roles installed.p  pFrom my understanding, it goes to the Mailbox Server  Submit  Hub  Front End SMTP  destination or have I got that wrong Ive tried to read through all the logs on the system but I cant find any of reference to the missing BCCs.p

Negative 197 pWe are building a massive multiplayer educational game with some millions of entries in the leaderboard based on aggregated XPs gained. After a game finishes, we need to show the leaderboard and how this playerstudent is ranked. But there are a couple of filters for this leaderboard globalby country, by monthyeartoday, by age etc that can be mixed together e.g. Get me the leaderboard codefor my Countrycode codefor the last monthcode. Number of combinations is 20. p  pMy problem is how to store such a structure that is updated regularly recalculation of rankings must be done after each game. A typical full leaderboard at the moment has 5 millions of entries for players coming from 150 countries.p  ol lipI used to have a MySQL Cluster Table userid, xps, countryid with 3 nodes, but ordering by XPs either in DBMS or application which required all data from DB proven to be too slow as numbers got bigger 20K of users. This is an interesting a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions5436263rankingwithmillionsofentriesposta but again half a second for each query is too much.pli lipThen we used REDIS see this a hrefhttphighscalability.comblog20117611commonwebusecasessolvedinredis.html relnofollowposta, but filtering is the problem here. We used separate lists for TOP 5 and the rest. TOP 5 was updated instantly, for the rest there was some delay of 2030 minutes. We in fact ranked this user based on a cached instance of the Leaderboard using the real XPs though, not the cached, so this was acceptable. Realtime on nonTop5 is not a prerequisite. This is fine for one global ranking, but how to filter the results based on month andor country andor age. Do we need to keep a list for every filtering combinationpli lipWe also tested custom structures in Java using it as a Java caching server similar in functionality with REDIS, still experimenting with it. Which is the best combination of structures to achieve our goal We ended up using one list per filtering combination e.g. codeMapltFilteringCombination, SortedListltUsergtgtcode and then doing binary search to the list of a specific key. This way, a finished game requires a couple of insertions say X, but it requires XNumOfPlayers space, which is X times more than keeping a single list not sure if this can fit to memory but we can always create a cluster here by splitting combinations to different servers. There is an issue here on how to rebuild the cache in case of failure, but that is another problem we can deal with.pli lipExtending the above method, we might slightly improve performance if we define scoring buckets inside each list eg a bucket for 0100xp, another for 101  1000xp, another for 1001  10000xp etc. The bucket splitting policy will be based on the players xp distribution in our game. Its true that this distribution is dynamic in real world, but we have seen that after a few months changes are minor, having in mind that XPs are always increasing but new users are coming as well.   pli lipWe are also testing Cassandras natural ordering by utilizing clustering keys and whiterows feature, although we know that having some millions of rows may not be easy to handle.pli ol  pAll in all, that is what we need to achieve. If a user lets name her UserX is not included in the Top5 list, we need to show this users ranking together with some surrounding players eg 2 above and 2 below as the example belowp  precode    Global TOP 5        My Global Ranking 425   My Country Ranking     Other Rankings       1. karen 12000xp          423. george              1. david     2. greg 11280xp           424. nancy               2. donald  3. philips 10293xp      425.

Negative 197 pI was wondering if any of you could help me with the following task dealing with the focal function in the R raster package.p  pBy default, the focal function will run through each cell of a given raster background raster hereafter and apply a given function to the neighboring values as defined by a userdefined moving window. In order to optimize and speed up my computation on large rastersstudy areas, I would like to apply this function filter only when the background raster has some values e.g. greater than zero within the extent covered by the moving window and skip all the other focal cells. This way, the filter would not spend time computing any focal value where there is no need to.p  pBelow a reproducible small example and inline commentsp  precodelibraryraster  x lt matrix125, ncol5 x[c1,2,3,6,7,8,11,12,13] lt 0 r lt rasterx  Apply filter to focal cells and return values using a 3x3 moving window...ONLY IF  ALL values found within the window are gt 0.

Negative 197 pI deployed a website to a webserver recently and have found an odd problem I cant seem to find the solution to. So the site needs to be accessed by customers and of course by the employees within their secure network.

Any ideas why it is working this way Maybe some IIS,network or bindingIIS setting that needs to be changedp  pThen secondly the scenario explained above is causing a few problems in the following scenario. So the customer accesses the portal and tries to register a new user, now after registration an email is created with a callback url to confirm the registration that needs to be clicked by the site administator inside the employees network. emIll put the code in below.em p  precode var callbackUrl  Url.ActionConfirmEmail, Account, new  userId  user.Id, code  code , protocol Request.Url.Scheme codepre  pThe code above creates the callback Url for the link the customer needs to click on to confirm hisher account. Now the problem isp  precodeprotocol Request.Url.Scheme codepre  preturns the hostname version url that the customer uses to access the site, but the site administrator is inside the secure network and thus the link does not work.

Negative 197 pI am unable to find the driver option to turn off paging as indicated in the documentation  p  pNote When using CQL Solr queries with Cassandra pagination enabled, you might experience a performance slowdown because Solr is not able to use its query result cache when pagination is configured. If you do not want to paginate through large result sets, disable pagination when running CQL Solr queries. See the driverdocumentation.p  pI see that the 2.1.6 driver has a new call called Statement.setPagingState but that seems to be for a different purpose. Can someone point me in the right direction Thanksp
Negative 197 pGtkGrids are not available in GTK2, so you have to use GtkTables instead.p  pWhen you create a GtkTable, you specify the number of rows and columns it has. You can then add items to this table using codegtktableattachdefaultscode. This function will allow you to add items to the table beyond its defined size. For example, you can create a table with three rows and successfully add items to the fourth row, without resizing the table.p  pIs it OK to do this, and what happens when you do thisp

Negative 197 pI am trying to add event bus into my project, because this is really great pattern to follow in order to make code more readable and application robust.br I need to listen to the Activity lifecycle methods.br Let me explain why do I need this.br I have activity, inside this activity there is running thread or threads that is tied to this activity exactly to the main UI thread posting some UI changes to the main queue.br When activity is going to be destroyed or paused I need to pause thread and resume it when activity is on screen again.br Of course I can pauseresume thread directly in onDestroy and onStart methods, but there are some another components that also need to listen to activity lifecycle methods.br strongThere are my questions strong   p  ol lipIs it correct use EventBus in this case, or it is better just to do everything in activity lifecycle methods directly without using event bus.  And using event bus in activity lifecycle is ambiguous and incorrect.p  ppublic class ExampleActivity extends Activity p  precodeprivate EventBus bus  EventBus.getDefault  private TextView view  Override protected void onCreateBundle savedInstanceState          bus.registerthis     bus.postnew OnCreateEventActivity has been born     super.onCreatesavedInstanceState      Override protected void onDestroy       Unregister     bus.postnew OnDestroyEventActivity is going to die     bus.unregisterthis     super.onDestroy  codepre  p  The one advantage I see here is that you havent to add some logic into activity lifecycle methods each time your part of activity needs this. Activity content can be quite complex,also fragments can be used, of course you can use fragment lifecycle methods also. But I wonder if fragment will not be destroyed to the time when activity lifecycle methods will be called, I havent tested this yet. So the main question here what is better to use native hook methods mechanism to do required stuff here or to use event bus. pli lipNext questions are not directly related to main question. Question are about the way in that codeEventBuscodea hrefhttpsgithub.comgreenrobotEventBus relnofollowEventBus Linka library for android is implemented. Why do not make listeners codebus.registerthiscode to implement interface for instance Subscribe with one method codeonEventBusEvent eventcode. And why not to make this method accept some basic class codeBusEventcode. In library implementation reflection is being used each time when event occurs and method codeonEventcode is called. I dont see any advantages in this approach and reflection is quite heavy thing in Java.pli ol  pI would be very grateful for any answers or advice.p

Negative 197 pI notice a timestamp mismatch between my webserver Amazon EC2 amp database Amazon RDS running PostgreSQL.

The server reads these entries and compares the timestamp with its own clock using Django codetimezone.nowcode to select entries newer than x minutes. p  pThis mismatch leads to inconsistenct data. Whats a good approach to make my code fault tolerant to clock mismatch between different machines.

Negative 197 pI had browse for days because of session and account security. And I almost finished my task while having two things unsolved.p  pMy website will use the default session function with changing the session id when privilege changed. And will check if the session was expired every. And last, I will implement session guess detection. The session is set to strict.p  pMy first question is how does session guess detection protect my web site. What I am going to do is, record the IP address with the incoming session id was not created yet. And after certain amount recorded, the website will accept session id which is already created  from that IP address. Would it help or any other measure should be implementedp  pFor the account security, I only implemented a dynamic salt. And will record for wrong password.p  pAnd I am going to record the IP address when he user logged. When the wrong password count exceeds the alert level. User will be disable from login for 5mins if the IP address had login history. Else the user will be disable from login for 24hours. Urm... what I mean is even someone guessed the password from a new IP address, users can still login after 5mins.p  pIs it good enough or totally wrongp  pIf there are any other security measure should be implement, it is welcome to state on the answer.p  pThx for reading such a long question.p

Negative 197 pI have a class that can be created by passing a list of strings or by passing a file. The file will be parsed, creating a list of strings. So its actually a helper constructor.p  pParsing the file may take a long time however and the resulting list of strings may not be used ever even though the object is created anyways. Therefore I got the idea of lazy parsing the file so that the file is actually only parsed right before some methods of this objects are used.p  pIs there any way to do this in groovy or even a better way to achieve what I wantp

Is there anything about their implementation that makes taking two natural logarithms more or equivalently performant than taking a single base 10 logarithm The second seems wasteful, provided the desired base is known at compile time.p

Negative 197 pIm trying to implement a generic deserializer for all classes that extend from a certain abstract class or implement a certain interface. In this example Im using interface codeStringConvertiblecode. I need to determine the concrete type and so that I can create an instance.p  pAn a hrefhttpjacksonusers.ning.comforumtopicsdeserializewithgenerictype relnofollowold forum post by Programmer Brucea led me to using ContextDeserializer and its working when the StringConvertible is a property in another class. p  pBut when I want to deserialize the StringConvertible directly, I cant find a way to get the concrete type because the codebeanPropertycode parameter is codenullcode. Apparently that is expected, according to a hrefhttpjacksonusers.ning.comforumtopicscontextualserializerandbeanproperty relnofollowthis questionanswera at the Jackson JSON User Group  code The only case where property should be null is when serializing a root value, meaning the object instance passed directly to ObjectMappers or ObjectWriters writeValue method  in this case there simply isnt a referring property.

Negative 197 pI have a Durandal application, and I use coderouter.mapUnknownRoutescode to display a userfriendly error page if the URL does not correspond to a known route.  This works fine  if I go to, say codefoocode, and that doesnt match a route, then the module specified by codemapUnknownRoutescode is correctly displayed.p  pHowever I cannot find any way to display that same error page when I have a parameterised route, and the parameter does not match anything on the backend.p  pFor example, say I have a route like codepeopleslugcode where the corresponding modules codeactivatecode method looks like thisp  precodethis.activate  function slug      dataService.loadslug.thenfunction            ... set observables used by view ...       codepre  pIf I go to, say codepeoplefoocode, then the result depends on whether codedataService.loadfoocode returns data or an errorp  ul liIf codefoocode exists on the backend then no problem  the observables are set and the composition continues. li liIf codefoocode doesnt exist, then the error is thrown because there is no codecatchcode.  This results in an unhandled error which causes the navigation to be cancelled and the router to stop working.li ul  pI know that I can return codefalsecode from codecanActivatecode and the navigation will be cancelled in a cleaner way without borking the router.  However this isnt what I want I want an invalid URL to tell the user that something went wrong.p  pI know that I can return code redirect notfound code or something similar from codecanActivatecode.  However this is terrible because it breaks the back button  after the redirect happens, if the user presses back they go back to codepeoplefoocode which causes another error and therefore another redirect back to codenotfoundcode.p  pIve tried a few different approaches, mostly involving adding a codecatchcode call to the promise definitionp  precodethis.activate  function slug      dataService.loadslug.thenfunction            ... set observables used by view ...     .catchfunction err           ... do something to indicate the error ...       codepre  ul liCan the codeactivatecode or codecanActivatecode notify the router that the route is in fact invalid, just as though it never matched in the first place  li liCan the codeactivatecode or codecanActivatecode issue a coderewritecode as opposed to a coderedirectcode so that the router will display a different module without changing the URLli liCan I directly codecomposecode some other module in place of the current module and cancel the current modules compositionli ul  pIve also tried an empty codecatchcode block, which swallows the error and I can add a toast here to notify the user, which is better than nothing.  However this causes a lot of binding errors because the observables expected by the view are never set.  Potentially I can wrap the whole view in an codeifcode binding to prevent the errors, but this results in a blank page rather than an error message or I have to put the error message into every single view that might fail to retrieve its data.  Either way this is view pollution and not DRY because I should write the not found error message only once.p  pI just want an invalid URL specifically a URL that matches a route but contains an invalid parameter value to display a page that says page not found.  Surely this is something that other people want as well  Is there any way to achieve thisp

Instead of saving the codeNSUSerDefaultscode for text size every time the user changes the size of the text, would it be possible to save it once when the app closes and without using a save buttonp  pI have found a hrefhttpsdeveloper.apple.comlibraryiosdocumentationiPhoneConceptualiPhoneOSProgrammingGuideTheAppLifeCycleTheAppLifeCycle.htmlapplerefdocuidTP40007072CH2SW3 relnofollowthisa which talks about methods such as codeapplicationWillTerminatecode and codeapplicationWillResignActivecode but am not quite sure how to implement these.p  pI have set the codepointSizecode to 18 by default, but when I increase thatp  precodeIBAction func largerTextButtonsender AnyObject      mainTextView.font   UIFontname mainTextView.font.fontName, size mainTextView.font.pointSize1     printlnmainTextView.font.pointSize  codepre  pAnd save it with the followingp  precodefunc applicationWillResignActiveapplication UIApplication      userDefaults.setObjectmainTextView.font.pointSize, forKey textSize     userDefaults.synchronize   func applicationWillTerminateapplication UIApplication      userDefaults.setObjectmainTextView.font.pointSize, forKey textSize     userDefaults.synchronize  codepre  pIt saves fine when I add this code to a button, but does not save under codeapplicationWillResignActivecode and codeapplicationWillTerminatecode so it is not an issue with the saving itself.

Negative 197 pI have a gigantic xml file, and I need to do some processing and that of course will be time consuming.

Negative 197 pI want to develop application for Android and iOS. It will be simple application with some data of users and some achievement animations. It will comunicate with our servers, where will be used REST as backend. I need the application to be secured. There will be stored very sensitive data. I think application wont need much performance. Im going to be project leader, so I have to find programmer. So if I use framework, then the programming language will have to be in good performanceprice ratio.p

I do so by running this checkp  precodeBluetoothAdapter adapter  BluetoothAdapter.getDefaultAdapter Build.VERSION.SDKINT gt AppConstants.BLEPERIPHERALSDKLEVEL   ampamp context.getPackageManager.hasSystemFeaturePackageManager.FEATUREBLUETOOTHLE   ampamp adapter  null   ampamp adapter.isMultipleAdvertisementSupported codepre  pwhich does 3 things 1 checks that the current OS supports the Android APIs that allow BLE advertising, 2 Checks that the device has hardware support for BLE and 3 checks that the device supports LE advertising these last two checks differp  pWhen Bluetooth is on, this check works great. When Bluetooth is off, however, the last call always returns codefalsecode, even for devices that previously returned codetruecode. I dont know if this is a bug or a feature, but this doesnt serve my needs because I simply want to know if the system can support it at some point and persist it as a setting, regardless of the current power state of the Bluetooth chip. Any ideasp

Negative 197 pI know that there is almost exact question on StackOverflow, but old and not answered in my opinion...p  pQuestion is as in topic. Ive got application in form of NotifyIcon with ContextMenu generated on the run. I want to fire event for every click on MenuItem, not just those without subitems.p  pOnClick event is turned off for such items as documentation states, but how to turn it on  p  pHow to extend MenuItem class to help me in this little problem   Or any other idea  ...p  pPeople like the way ContextMenus work. Ok. But this app is only for me, just to simplify few tasks.p  pSorry i dont post any source code, tried few possible solutions, none worked so far...p  pEdit     Simple Windows Forms application    .NET Framework 4.0    Using only NotifyIcon and ContextMenu with MenuItems.  p  hr  pOK.

Negative 197 pIve been tasked to maintain and expand a codebase that heavily rest on Celery. This code needs to distribute several complex tasks, taking quite a long time each. Tasks were not designed as function, but directly as classes inheriting from Celery.p  pHowever, when you extend the task class from celery, your workers will create one and only one instance of the class, meaning that you severely pollute self. The previous developers found a clever solution involving metaclasses to avoid this behaviour and create a new instance each time a task need to be run. This is efficient, but the result gives a code that is rather hard to read and debug, and that strays far away from classical celery usages. Im also afraid it will prevent us from upgrading our versions of celery if new versions of celery make extensive changes.p  pI have the opportunity to refactor this code, but Im not sure if I should. The only solution I can think of is to transform the current Task classes into helper classes, and put the tasks themselves in simple functions that instantiate those helper classes and do the hard work. Are there any patterns to do this, or celery functionalities that I missed for this situation p  pN.B. this is pure celery, there is no Django in the mixp

I suspect that this do not work in the same way that file upload do using a multi part form.pli lipIs required a connection using socketspli lipHow should the server expose the broadcast at the same time its receiving it.pli lipCan something like this be done by a small team 3  5 or should I look for paid services that can solve this problempli ul  pIn the past, I have built many web applications so I am aware of most of the required components of them HTTP requestresponse cycle, basic security, REST API, data bases, cache, etc., however, I have never dealt with an application of this kind.p

Negative 197 pI need to apply my predicate to a list of lists. I heard maplist3 might be able to do this but my lists within the list may vary in length and maplist likes all the same length lists. p  pHere is the predicate I need to apply to all lists in the list. It checks if any elements in another list in the same position are the same and if they are it returns false. Ex compatible[1,2,3,4,5],[1,6,7,3,2] would return false since the 1 matches in the 1st position. This predicate works for varying lengths of lists.p  precodecompatible[],. compatible,[]. compatible[HATA],[HBTB]      HA  HB,     compatibleTA,TB. codepre  pA sample lists of list might look like thisp  precode[[3,4,6,6,7],[8,2,6,3,67],[7,4,7,4,3]],[[8,2,6,3,67],[7,4,7,4,3]].  Let X and Y be the lists passed in. where X[[3,4,6,6,7],[8,2,6,3,67],[7,4,7,4,3]] and Y[[8,2,6,3,67],[7,4,7,4,3]] codepre  pI need to apply the predicate to the Y list only. How would I call compatible on the list of lists to do that keeping in mind varying length.p
