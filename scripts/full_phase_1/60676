Positive 60676 pIs there a tutorial or example for building a form with ZF2 and Doctrine that can update more than one record at a timep  pFor example, lets say that we want to create a form in the Album module that lists a group of albums and each album in the list has a check box for a new field called favorites.  How do we configure the form and the controller to update each of the records where the user checked the box, perhaps triggered by an event like pressing an update buttonp

Positive 60676 pI am using a Doctrine2 type to encrypt database values. The type converts the PHP value internally to and from a database value by encrypting and decrypting it. This works perfectly due to the Doctrine2 types. p  pThe encryption is stored as a base64 encoded string. Every encrypted string is prefixed by a fixed defined prefix. This means the database field contains both encrypted and decrypted values this is required by external requirements, recognized by the prefix.p  hr  pMy wish is the followingp  pAssume I have an entity.

Each and evry methods can return a different nombre of column results. p  pExample   Sql 1  JoDATE Sql 2  ClientCarTimep  pLets tell that I dont want to create a Entity to use it with doctrine...p  pI would like to use DBAL pdo doctrine sql query to do execute my queries... like in normal PHP poo programming. p  pFinally the question is  wether I should do this class as a Service, Entity or I can simple put the pdo query in the controller....p  pThanks in advance for your answers... I avoid doctrine for the moment because I principaly doing some statistiques and also to play a bit with symfony and to increase the difficutly level progresivly... p  pthanks for your understanding...

Positive 60676 pI have created a Symfony 2 Bundle that supports private messages between users. I gave them the ability to send messages from their codeinboxcode or codesentcode folder to the codetrashcode one. Messages will be marked as trash through the codeisRTrashcode and codeisSTrashcode fields, marked by receiver and by sender, respectively. That is because, being the same message in my database, if I had one single field here, one user marking it as trash, would mark it for the other one, as well. p  pNow, I want to give them the possibility to codedeletecode them, too, from their trash folder. Messages wont be deleted, but marked similarly to trash ones, just that they are forever gone from standard user view. Im having problems with marking them like this, because I have to mark both messages that are sent and received by the user.p  pIve made the following query in the entitys repositoryp  precode    public function deleteuser, msg              qb  thisgtcreateQueryBuildera             gtupdatePrivateMessageBundleMessage, a             gtwherea INmsg             gtandwherea.receiver  user AND a.isRTrash IS NOT null AND a.isRDeleted  falsegtseta.isRDeleted, true             gtorWherea.sender  user AND a.isSTrash IS NOT null AND a.isSDeleted  falsegtseta.isSDeleted, true             gtsetParameters                 arrayuser gt user, msg gt msg              echo ltpregt DoctrineCommonUtilDebugdumpqbgtgetQuerygtgetSQL exit echo ltpregt         return qbgtgetQuery      codepre  pAnd the output query is codestring196 UPDATE message SET isRDeleted  1, isSDeleted  1 WHERE id IN  AND receiverid   AND isRTrash IS NOT NULL AND isRDeleted  0 OR senderid   AND isSTrash IS NOT NULL AND isSDeleted  0codep  pI give as input the curent logged in user and an array of message ids. Then, I check messages that are in trash, are not marked as deleted and have the curent user as receiver or sender and want to mark them as deleted.p  pThe problem is that both conditions are met, and both codeSETcode are being called, marking a messages codeisRDeletedcode and codeisSDeletedcode to true, regardless.p  pI am very close, but dont know how to make it so that the fields are marked separately, only if their condition is met.p  pMeanwhile, Im using a foreach loop, but I think it can be done faster with a queryp  precode   em  thisgtgetDoctrinegtgetManager     foreach msgs as msgid          msg  messagesgtfindOneByarrayid gt msgid           if msggtgetSender  thisgtgetUser ampamp msggtgetIsSTrash ampamp msggtgetIsSDeleted  false              msggtsetIsSDeletedtrue             changedno          else if msggtgetReceiver  thisgtgetUser ampamp msggtgetIsRTrash ampamp msggtgetIsRDeleted  false              msggtsetIsRDeletedtrue             changedno                   emgtflush      codepre

Negative 60676 pI have created a custom UserControl in Managed C that wraps some native code controls. I have confirmed the control works at runtime, and have been trying to make the control work with the Visual Studio designer by allowing drag and drop of the control from the designer toolbox.p  pWhile I have successfully added the UserControl to the toolbox, nothing happens when I drag the control onto a windows form. To investigate the problem, I opened a second Visual Studio 2008 instance and attached its debugger to the devenv.exe instance where I am attempting to use the UserControl. After dropping the UserControl onto the windows forms, the Visual Studio debugger outputs a FileNotFoundException in mscorlib.dll when trying to load the module containing the UserControl.p  pI noticed that the designer does not load the dll from the projects output path, but rather creates a copy of the assembly in the UserDataVisualStudio9.0ProjectAssembliesRandomFolderName folder. However, none of the modules dependencies are copied, which I believe is the source of the FileNotFoundException.p  pAny ideas how to resolve this issue Ideally Vistual Studio would copy all the assemblys dependencies when copying the dll to the ProjectAssemblies folder, but I cant figure out any way to make this happen.p

Negative 60676 pOne problem encountered with a hrefhttpen.wikipedia.orgwikiMutationtestingmutation testinga is that its slow, because by default you do a full test run either a test file, or a suite of test files for each mutation generated.p  pOne way to make mutation testing faster would be to stop the test run for a given mutant once a single failure has been encountered but only during mutation testing. Even better would be for the mutation tester to remember what was the first test to kill the last mutant, and give that first to the next mutant. Is there anything in ruby that does either of these things, or is my best bet to start monkey patchingp  pYes, I know unit tests ought to be fast. And showing all of the failed tests is useful outside of mutation testing, as it helps you not merely identify that somethings wrong, but pinpoint where its going wrongp  pbEditb Im currently using heckle with testunit. If its not possible for testunit to remember which tests fail between runnings, maybe heckle or something running heckle could remember it.p

Negative 60676 p.NET 3.5 app written in C here with both jQuery and some ASP.NET AJAX UpdatePanel flavouring.  Im running into an interesting issue. I created a pagination user control that is made up of LinkButtons. The user control fires off an event called CurrentPageChanged whenever someone clicks on a page, previous, first, or next buttons.

Negative 60676 pI have written an ASP.NET MVC application that allows the user to specify their own custom domain. I have IIS configured to send all requests to the default website so I do not need to use host headers. Everything works perfectly.

Thats not really an option for me. What Im looking for here are some options Im open to unconventional .p  pI have seen some constructive responses that suggest using ISA server as an SSL proxy. Does anyone know more about this Or has anyone configured this and had successp  pBasically I want to provide the my users a way to request a CSR from the application, go purchase and download an SSL certficate, come back to my application and upload the certificate issued by an authorized certification company.p  pId like to do this without having to provide separate IP addresses to clients that want to use a custom domain and ssl on their site.

I certainly didnt understand this problem as well as I do now. I think my solution for now will be to generate a wildcard certificate and force my clients to use clientname.someshareddomain.com if they want a secured connection. For clients that simply arent OK with that, I will probably provision another elastic IP address via api call to amazon web services, create a new website in IIS and point it at my applications root folder, and then programatically generate a CSR from that new site. Im just going to have to work out some kind of deal with Amazon to give me a decent block of IP addresses.p

However, that leaves the class untestable because I cant keep it from actually hitting the database. So, I went with Dependency Injection, and pass the Database in.p  pNow, Im stuck, because theres no way to mock Database in order to test GetNotifications. Im wondering if Im overly complicating things, or if Im missing something. Am I doing this the right way, or should I be rethinking how Ive got this set upp  pEdit to add more infoememp  pI really dont want to test the database. I want the Data.Notifications class above to return an instance of ResultData, but thats all I really want to test.

I modified all of the code to pass the Database in which gets created a the webs Base page, but now Im just not certain what to do next. I thought I was one unit test away from having this resolved, but apparently, either Im wrong or Ive got a mental roadblock to the right path.p

Negative 60676 pWe have a library of ZIP files that we would like to make available for download at an ASP.NET site.p  pThe files are sitting on a NAS device that is accessible from out web farm.p  pHere is our initial strategyp  ol liMap an IIS virtual directory to the shared drive at path zipfilesli liUsers can download the zip files when given the URLli ol  pHowever, if users share links to the files, anyone can download them. We would instead like to make use of the ASP.NET forms authentication in our site to validate users requests before initiating the file transfer.p  pA few problems A request for a zip file is handled by IIS, not ASP.NET. So it is not subject to forms authentication. In addition, strongwe dont want ASP.NET to handle the requeststrong, because it uses up an ASP.NET thread and is not scalable for download of large files. So, configuring the asp.net dll to handle .zip requests is not an option.p  pAny ideas on thisp  pOne idea weve tossed around is this Initial request for download will be for an ashx handler. This handler will, after authentication, generate a download token which is saved to a database. Then, the user is redirected to the file with token appended in QueryString e.g. filesxyz.ziptoken123456789. An ISAPI plugin will be used to check the token. Also, the token will expire after x amount of time. Any thoughts on this I have not implemented an ISAPI plugin so Im not sure if this will even work.p  pI would like to avoid custom coding since security is an issue and Id prefer to use a timetested solution.p

Negative 60676 pa hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions3123777is100codecoverageareallygoodthingwhendoingunittestsThis question about unit testsa sparked another thing thats been bothering me. Ive gone back and forth on three ways to do unit tests when hitting a database.p  ol liCreate mock objects and plug them in. This has the advantage of not needing a database, but its time consuming and Im not sure how much return on investment Im getting. Ive been getting into IOC and moq a little bit, but it still seems painful.li liCreate a setup and teardown database scripts to create known cases, and test for those. Again, can be time intensive, but still easier to create than mock objects most of the time. And other people at work can still run it assuming they have SQL server on their localhost. li liManually check the dev database and modify unit tests. Intensively manual work, but if I have a test set that doesnt change, it seems to work OK. On my machine, at least . li ol  pI know option 1 is the proper way to do unit tests, but of the three, thats probably the option Ive used the least although the latest projects have been with IOC, so that door is open to me. I realize a lot of it depends on what exactly is being mocked and what is being tested, but what am I missing here  p  pIf context helps, Im in a C shop, writing inhouse applications, only a few developers. p

Negative 60676 pI am trying to clear up some things regarding complexity in some of the operations of TreeSet. On the javadoc it says p  blockquote   pThis implementation provides   guaranteed logn time cost for the   basic operations add, remove and   contains.p blockquote  pSo far so good. My question is what happens on addAll, removeAll etc. Here the javadoc for Set saysp  blockquote   pIf the specified collection is also a   set, the addAll operation effectively   modifies this set so that its value is   the union of the two sets.p blockquote  pIs it just explaining the logical outcome of the operation or is it giving a hint about the complexity I mean, if the two sets are represented by e.g. redblack trees it would be better to somehow join the trees than to add each element of one to the other.p  pIn any case, is there a way to combine two TreeSets into one with Ologn complexityp  pThank you in advance. p

Negative 60676 pThis question refers to the dequeueing of messages in strongOracle Streams Advanced Queueingstrong. p  pI need to ensure that the messages which are related to each other are processed sequentially. p  pFor example, assume the queue is seeded with the four messages that have a businessrelated field called transaction reference txnref and two of the messages 1,3 belong to the same transaction 000001p  precodeid  txnref     1  000001    2  000002    3  000001    4  000003   codepre  pAssume also that I am running 4 threadsprocesses that wish to dequeue from this queue.

Negative 60676 pIm pretty noob with ASP.NET programming and im a bit confused on a problem that im facing right now.p  pWe, as devs in my company, live in a clustered environment like the one shown in figurep  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comjkYxR.jpg altalt textp  pNothing really special. You see, IIS Websites are duplicated on evry FrontEnd Servers. Business logic resides on BackEnds that are sitting, togheder with DB and NAS File system, behind a firewall.p  pSo communication between the public space and the protected one is permitted only through particular channels, with particular requests, to particular IPs and Protocols.p  pNow, we were asked to build a site where the user can customize his own environment, upload images strongthat will be dispalyed in his HomePagestrong and other features.p  pIn a classical configuration, a user upload an image that is written in a folder in the site root, and then the HTML refers to that image to populate whatever control to display it. But, when a user connect to our site, the load balancer will choose one particular frontend thats not the same for evry session.  So, a user will upload his file, disconnect and then come back only to find that his image is gone, couse the Load Balancer has routed his request to a differnt frontend where the image does not exist.p  pSo the need to write a piece of code that pull the file from the NAS behind the Firewall. The upload part is stupid, and i can understand it.p  pMy problem is when the user connects to his page, how i reference in the HTML an image thats not on the machine the site is running on but on a completely hidden File systemp  pI thought of writing a WCF that serve the image as as a byte stream, but which ASP.NET control to use on the Page to put the stream content on, and Howp  pI Know that asking the experts community will bring me the best way to accomplish this.p  pHope this is clear enough.p  pThanks so much for the replays and excuse me for the bad english form.p

Thanks for reading all of this. Ive already implemented it and it works nicely, and Im planning to extend it to validate the contents of IEnumerable fields and other fields that are codeValidatablecode. p  ul liWhat Im particularly concerned about is that if no ruleset is specified, the validator tries to use the name of the property as the ruleset name. If you dont want that behavior, you can use code[SuppressValidation]code. This makes the code much less cluttered no need to use code[UseValidationRulesetsomething]code on every single property but it somehow doesnt feel right. I cant decide if its awful or awesome. What do you thinkli liAny suggestions on the other parts of this design are welcome too. Im not very experienced and Im grateful for any help.li liAlso, is Validatable a good name To me, it sounds pretty weird but Im not a native English speaker.li ul

Negative 60676 pThe title might not be so clear because I couldnt find a better one but what Im trying to figure out is when you have a normal as opposed to partial view, usually theres a GET action method which simply renders the view with a new instance of the view model, and a POST action method usually with the same name that accepts an instance of the view model as a parameter. Inside the POST action method, you check the ModelState if its valid you do what youre supposed to do, if not you render the view again with the same view model instance in order to display any errors.p  pThats actually one of the things I really like about ASP.NET MVC, but how does that work with Partial Views If I render back a partial view with the instance of the view model, it only displays the partial view with a white background, out of the context of the whole web application.

Negative 60676 pI am loading Flash SWFs into an Android WebView.p  pI want the SWF to be instantly fullscreen and focused.p  pThe class name that handles flash is codecom.adobe.flashplayer.FlashPaintSurfacecode. Watching the log, when I fullscreen the flash manually, it calls codecom.adobe.flashplayer.FlashPaintSurface.toggleFullScreencode.p  pThe first part of my question is How can I call that method manually for my Flash SWF p  pNote that with a webview with a flash embedded, the only way I seem to be able to fullscreen it properly to have Flashs codesurfaceviewcode fullscreen instead of the flash being displayed over top of the codewebview viewcode is by touching the screen with two fingers until an interface pops up at the top of the screen, and doesnt happen reliably.p  pFor focus, inside my webview class I callp  precodeOverride  protected boolean drawChild Canvas canvas, View child, long drawingTime       if child.getClass.getName.equalscom.adobe.flashplayer.FlashPaintSurface          child.requestFocus          return super.drawChildcanvas, child, drawingTime  codepre  pThis doesnt set the focus as I thought it would. Although I assume, if fullscreened properly, the FlashPaintSurface should give itself focus.

Negative 60676 pI want to find a solution to make webpage for closed group private in which is possible for accounts with writting ability to post twitter like messeges when new info needed to be posted and that it can have many teams like Project Team A amp B.p  pEach user could be in many teams. All team writings can be viewable in one page but on other page only those writings that comes from only each users teams which can be 2 or 3.p  pExample for twitter is the wordpress.com theme a hrefhttpen.blog.wordpress.com20090311p2thenewprologue relnofollowhttpen.blog.wordpress.com20090311p2thenewprologuea.p  pBut it lacks need of being able to make Teams. It has tags but every time tag needs to be written so if it would be possible to auto make if Im from Team A then tag all my team tags on each my post automatically.p  pEither existing service for that just register wordpress, identi.ca or service like kodingen.com where i can deploy Joomla or other CMS.p  pA CMS like joomla I hope some has some solution with plugins or wordpress cms that has that theme I mentioned. Diaspora, maybe but havent tried it. Buddypress.com just somehow came on google when randomly searched.p  pTwitter can be private but only for whole account so I need new account that is OK, but it doesnt have auto tags if Im from Team A.p  pFacebook cant have privacy. All users will be anonymous so new profile making in FB could be good and making groups and all users invite only each other, but they need to be anonymous, which is opposite of facebook. Maybe even workflow will be interupted if some user gets banned becuase its a Narwhal or Dragon.p  pOptionally, pages can also be made and even better if collaborative, like Google Wave or Docs can be made and added countdown timer added. Countdown is more needed comparing to page writing like Docs or Wave that can be just any small Wiki plugin.p

Negative 60676 pIm working on optimizing a site for mobile. We have a Location page that includes info about a location and a map of the location via the Google Maps API. v2  I know its deprecated but I havent justified the time to upgrade, if it aint broke.. I want to use a single column layout with basic information followed by the map followed by more information.p  pNow when I use my finger to scroll down the mobile page on an iPhone, once I get to the map, the page scrolling is overridden and the map starts panning. The only way for me to scroll farther down the page is to put my finger above or below the map, assuming such space is available. If I disable map dragging, then when I start scrolling down and get to the map it doesnt pan but the page doesnt scroll either. I would like to treat the map as a static image that I can scroll past, but still allow the zoom buttons and allow the map to be redrawn with directions through a select field I have coded, so a a hrefhttpcode.google.comapismapsdocumentationstaticmapsliteral static imagea is not a solution.p  pI found a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions5596781googlemapsapisuppressmappanningtoenablepagescrolling56799495679949this post that required similar functionalitya, but its using v3.

Negative 60676 pI am working on a project that uses hibernate and spring. Hibernate is encapsulated in a DAO layer and the DAO layer has corresponding service layer as well, theres also the controllers that is mapped for requests and JSP pages. I was told not to pass objects between these layers Controllers lt Service lt DAO as it is performance overhead. One particular instance was when I needed to update a boolean value in a domain object ORM class, I wrote a method that passed the domain object between Service layer and DAO layer, and I was told to pass the object ID and the particular boolean value only and to write separate methods in the layers for that. Is this right I feel doing so will invalidate many advantages of using an ORM tool Hibernate. Am I wrong to think this Any advice and insights will be useful.... p

Negative 60676 pI have an Zend Framework application. I seem to be having an issue with IE8 and jQuery that culminates after several many posts. That is, it gets worse and worse as the amount of posts increases. Whats happening is, after a while doing data entry without reloading the page, if I try to navigate away or reload the page, IE8 acts really weirdglitchyshifty and will sometimes tell me its tried all it can do and will stop trying to load the page. When I reload from there it resets and everything works fine for a while until it builds up and happens again.p  pTo explain a little more about what happens, lets say I have a few other tabs open in IE8if I try to navigate to another page in the application, IE8 displays some other tab and flickers a little bit before reloading the page and displaying it. If I reload at this point, it does what you would normally expect. If I DONT reload at this point, the next time the badness builds up again and I try to reload, IE8 will tell me its not going to try anymore, and I have to manually type the URL into the navigation bar in order to get back to the application. p  pI have a feeling it has to do with my keypress binding, but Im not sure why.

Negative 60676 pMy team is planning to create a simulation game using Javascript, CodeIgniter and MySQL for the backend. p  pIt will be mostly click based, ie There will be buttons for activities like Eat, Play, Study, etc, and in the game environment, one day will contain 3 phases, day, noon, night . And for each phase, users can pick between those activities and those activities will increase certain character parameters Intelligence, Focus, Fun, etc then the game will progress to the next phase. Once its night, the game will progress to the next day.p  pSo I need feedbacks on how to saving the game progress. Heres what I had in mind p  ul lipThere will be a table for Users obviously that will contain users data including the parametersstats, money, etc. Do you think the stats etc must be separated to another table so there will be a history of stat increasespli lipFor the saving, Im thinking of using a Logs table that record every activity is by users. So if in day 1 phase 1 phase day the user picks Eat, I will insert to this logs table more or less like  userid  1, day  1, phase  1, activity  eat. So for example when the user stops playing and exits the game after day 1 phase night, the database will have p  precodeuserid  1, day  1, phase  1, activity  eat userid  1, day  1, phase  2, activity  play userid  1, day  1, phase  3, activity  sleep codepre  pAnd when they continue the game, I will read from this table and get the latest row of this userid, and after checking that the latest row is day 1 phase 3, the game interface will display day 2 phase 1. However, this means that the phases for a day must be fixed from the start, so I cant include, for example, random additional time phases outside these phases think of it as an extra opportunity to increase the stats.pli ul  pSo what do you think I hope the explanation is clear enough.p

Negative 60676 pI want to know if SQLAlchemy can support instant loading of the current state of an object from the database when another process updates some attributes of the same object.p  pI want to mention, I am migrating from SQLObject to SQLAlchemy.

However, I dont like this because this is ugly and I want to use as much SQLAlchemys features as possible than me hacking something.p  pSo I am trying to find an exact match of this SQLObjects feature in SQLAlchemy.

Negative 60676 pI have some predicates, e.g.p  precodeisdivisibleby13  lambda i i  13  0 ispalindrome  lambda x strx  strx[1] codepre  pand want to logically combine them as inp  precodefilterlambda x isdivisibleby13x and ispalindromex, range1000,10000 codepre  pThe question is now Can such combination  be written in a a hrefhttpsen.wikipedia.orgwikiTacitprogrammingpointfreea style, such asp  precodefilterisdivisibleby13 and ispalindrome, range1000,10000 codepre  pThis has of course not the desired effect because the truth value of lambda functions is codeTruecode and codeandcode and codeorcode are shortcircuiting operators. The closest thing I came up with was to define a class codePcode which is a simple predicate container that implements codecallcode and has the methods codeandcode and codeorcode to combine predicates. The definition of codePcode is as followsp  precodeimport copy  class Pobject     def initself, predicate         self.pred  predicate      def callself, obj         return self.predobj      def copypredself         return copy.copyself.pred      def andself, predicate         pred  self.copypred         self.pred  lambda x predx and predicatex         return self      def orself, predicate         pred  self.copypred         self.pred  lambda x predx or predicatex         return self codepre  pWith codePcode I can now create a new predicate that is a combination of predicates like thisp  precodePisdivisibleby13.andispalindrome codepre  pwhich is equivalent to the above lambda function. This comes closer to what Id like to have, but it is also not pointfree the points are now the predicates itself instead of their arguments. Now the second question is Is there a better or shorter way maybe without parentheses and dots to combine predicates in Python than using classes like codePcode and without using lambda functionsp

Negative 60676 pCan someone shed some light on the semantics for accessing an enum defined in a class in Cp  pIn particular, why are enum members accessed by the name of the class rather than the enum itself Given that the codeenumcode is the containerscope, just as codenamespacecode and codeclasscode are, why is accessing an element of the container treated differently when its an codeenumcode than when its a codeclasscodep  pGivenp  precodenamespace mynamespace      class myclass          public         enum myenum                      enum1,             enum2                   int myint       codepre  pWhy is the fullyqualified name for codeenum1code codemynamespacemyclassenum1code and not codemynamespacemyclassmyenumenum1codep  pWhile the latter works, its not the recommended way of calling it and some compilers will throw a warning there. IMHO, it should not only be right, but it should also be the only way of accessing it.p  pIt makes for really odd access rules, and makes things very weird when you add a new codeenum1code in a different enum at which point you must add the qualifier.p  pReally, it defeats the purpose of an enum. The members of the enum are really more members of the class than they are of the enum, and I must say I find the behavior in other languages e.g. C to be much more preferable. p  pI imagine this is to keep compatibility with C, but I dont see why requiring the enum name in the access semantic would be the better option... Id imagine making the emclassem name optional would be the option that preserves C compatibility.p

Running codeplay deps verbosecode shows that they were found codefound my.groupmodule10.0.1 in jars in [default]code but the Installing resolved dependencies section adds a strange path thats different than the others. While the jars from other group IDs are listed as codelibmodule21.2.0.jarcode, the jars from my module are shown as codemoduleslib gt ltpathtoplayprojgtlibcode. So although it looks like the dependencies resolution was executed successfully, those specific jars dont get copied.p  pIf I change emdependencies.ymlem to this formatp  precoderequire     play     my.group.module1 gt module1 0.0.1     my.group.module2 gt module2 0.0.1SNAPSHOT     my.other.group gt module1 1.0alpha     my.other.group gt module2 1.2.0  repositories     jars       type     local       artifact application.pathjars[module][revision].jar       contains           my.group.module1 gt            my.group.module2 gt            my.other.group gt  codepre  pwhere I include the module name in the declaration of the contains section, then the jars get copied successfully. Which leads to my second problemp  p2 When I run codeplay depscode, it seems like my jars are either modified when theyre copied, or theyre being pulled down from some older cached version. I was getting inconsistent behavior when running my program, as if old code was being used. I did a codels alcode on both the lib and jars folders to compare, and the file size is much smaller on the copied jars than on the originals. p  pAny ideas whats happening here Ive been able to work around it by copying jars manually, but I have no idea why theres this inconsistency between jars from certain groups.p

Negative 60676 pI know how codeltlink typestylesheet href.. gtcode and codeltscript typetextjavascript src.. gtcode work. But I have some truble understanding where they should be in context of W3C and also in context of good programming practice. I was many examples where these are in the header. I dont know why, but seems legit. But what impact has it when theyre somewhere else in the HTML codep  pTake for instance a codeheadercode file, that is included by PHP into all pages of a website, and this header file has its own CSSJS files. So they can either be included in the header file itself, and then there will be a codelinkcode and a codescriptcode tag in the middle of the HTML body of the page including the header file. Another option is putting these in the codeheadcode section of each file, but then changes will have to be made in every single page.p  pMy questionsp  ol liWhere should the codelinkcode and codescriptcode tags be according to W3Cli liWhat impact will it have if they are in the middle of the HTML body like in the example aboveli liWhat is the best solution in terms of good programming practiceli liHow do I make the following codeincludecode, while having a W3C compliant page, and in a way that I dont have to update each page when I change the CSSJS file. ul liConsider the included code snippet to be independent of the including page.li ulli ol  pstrongJust for clearness a short examplestrong Consider same situation also for a JS filep  pheader.htmlp  pre classlanghtml prettyprintoverridecode   ltlink relstylesheet hrefheader.css gt     lt Should this be here gt ltnavgt    ltulgt      ltligtMenu item1ltligt      ltligtMenu item2ltligt    ltulgt ltnavgt codepre  pindex.phpp  pre classlanghtml prettyprintoverridecodelthtmlgt    ltheadgt       ltlink relstylesheet hrefheader.css gt     lt Or should it be here gt    ltheadgt    ltbodygt       ltphp includeheader.html gt       lt Some HTML code gt    ltbodygt lthtmlgt codepre  pheader.cssp  pre classlangcss prettyprintoverridecodenav color 00FF00  codepre

Negative 60676 pI am writing a multithreaded application and as of now I have this idea. I have a codeFILE[n]code where codencode is a number determined at runtime. I open all the n files for reading and then multiple threads can access to read it. The computation on the data of each file is equivalent i.e. if serial execution is supposed then each file will remain in memory for the same time.p  pEach files can be arbitrarily large so on should not assume that they can be loaded in memory.p  pNow in such a scenario I want to reduce the number of disk IOs that occur. It would be great if someone can suggest any shared memory model for such scenario I dont know if I am using one because I have very less idea of how things are implemented .I am not sure how should I achieve this. In other words i just want to know what is the most efficient model to implement such a scenario. I am using codeCcode.p  pEDIT A more detailed scenario.p  pThe actual problem is I have n bloom filters for data contained in n files and once all the elements from a file are inserted in the corresponding bloom filter I need to need to do membership testing. Since membership testing is a readonly process on data file I can read file from multiple threads and this problem can be easily parallelized. Now the number of files having data are fairly largearound 20k and note that number of files equals number of bloom filter so I choose to spawn a thread for testing against a bloomfilter i.e. each bloom filter will have its own thread and that will read every other file one by one and test the membership of data against the bloom filter. I wan to minimize disk IO in such a case.p

Negative 60676 pSo I am learning Google App Engine with Java. When modifying files i realized I dont always see my changes. I try clicking the red button to stop the web application in eclipse and then restarting the application however I dont see the changes. This even happens if i run chrome in incognito mode. I also have the same problem with IE and Firefox By default i use firefox when developing due to my preference of firebug. p  pAlso at times I will get annoyed with one project and start a new google app engine project. However the GAE will still be running the first one not the second one even though i close the project. Even worse was when i deleted the root project folder I still saw the index.html page though the links were broken for the project i deleted. p  pI am thinking there are two issues one is that my browser is storing these files in a cache.

Negative 60676 pSome of my domain classes are getting rather rich  They implement an interesting comparable, might have plus, minus, multiply and div, many have some convenient getters which call services and determine complicated things.

Negative 60676 pIve been watching a Qt tutorial series on YouTube, in which the author shows how to call a function, when a button is pressed. a hrefhttpwww.youtube.comwatchv2edb0VOkxk3t361s relnofollowHe rightclicked on the button in Qt Creator IDE and chose Go to slot, from where he chose the signal which would fire the generated functiona. Since I am used to develop with Netbeans, I simply tried to follow his example using the embedded Qt Designer. Unfortunately, there is no Go to slot... entry when I rightclick on my button or any widget. I could, of course, create a new slot for my main window and then connect the buttons signal to it, but doing it with a single function just seems way more convenient and clean to me. Is there a way to fix is, or if not, at least a way to do with via code entirely, without having to add a new slot to the main window for every single button that servers a different purpose Thanks for your help.p

Negative 60676 pi have been trying to draw a rounded rectangle with spacing in the border, but i cant seem to find a way to do this using the Canvas.RoundRect function, and i am not that good in maths to draw the edges myself, i can draw a rectangle with spacing using the Canvas.MoveTo and Canvas.LineTo functions, but i dont know how to make the edges rounded. Currently what i am doing is i make yellow rectangle at the place where i want to make the spacing in the border but the problem is when i am printing i have to directly draw on printer canvas and i have to draw on a transparent sheet, so a background color will cause problems. Anyone who can help me build a custom drawing routine or tell me how can i erase that area and still print on a transparent paper without any background color.

Negative 60676 pWe are trying to send uncaught GWT exceptions we are using GWT 2.5 rc1 to our server for logging and debugging purposes.  We want to deobfuscate the exception stack traces, otherwise it would be pretty much useless.p  pAfter some investigations, I found a hrefhttpwww.summatech.comblog201206117tipsforexceptionhandlingingwt7 Tips for Exception Handling in GWTa and a hrefhttpcode.google.compgooglewebtoolkitwikiWebModeExceptionsWebModeExceptionsa that contained valuable information.p  pSo we created a GWT UncaughtExceptionHandler that uses a custom RPC service to transfer the exceptions with their stack traces.  That works fine.p  pAs described in a hrefhttpcode.google.compgooglewebtoolkitwikiWebModeExceptionsResymbolizationDeobfuscationWebModeExceptions deobfuscation sectiona, we enabled stacktrace emulation with this in our GWT module p  precodeltsetproperty namecompiler.stackMode valueemulated gt ltsetconfigurationproperty namecompiler.emulatedStack.recordLineNumbers     valuetrue gt codepre  pNow our stacktraces look like this p  precodecom.google.gwt.core.client.JavaScriptException TypeError  Cannot call method pp of null     Unknown.aTUnknown Source174     Unknown.AVaUnknown Source501     Unknown.YFUnknown Source29     Unknown.LqbUnknown Source138     ... codepre  pIt seems ok to me because it contains the obfuscated method name and the line number which seems to be what is needed as described in a hrefhttpcode.google.compgooglewebtoolkitwikiWebModeExceptionsResymbolizationDeobfuscationWebModeExceptions deobfuscation sectiona.p  pThen we compile our GWT modules with the extra parameter to get the symbolmaps.p  pOur custom log service uses the symbolMaps directory to invoke com.google.gwt.logging.server.StackTraceDeobfuscator.  We use XGWTPermutation http header to invoke the deobfuscator.  I stepped in the deobfuscate method to make sure it could load the symbol map.  It could.  I validated that the symbolMap file name used was matching the .cache.js file name of the GWT module.  It does match.p  pSo basically, the service does thisp  precode Create the deobfuscator String dir  getSymbolMapsDirPath StackTraceDeobfuscator deobfuscator  new StackTraceDeobfuscatordir   request is the HttpServletRequest String strongName  request.getHeaderRpcRequestBuilder.STRONGNAMEHEADER   Deobfuscate the stack trace exception.setStackTrace     deobfuscator.deobfuscateStackTraceexception.getStackTrace, strongName   Log the exception logger.severeUncaught GWT exception, exception codepre  pThe end result is that the stack traces dont get deobfuscated.  Sometimes, some lines would get deobufscated with the wrong class and method name but nothing more.

Negative 60676 pI am building a site for someone who wants to have a sound cloud player on his site, but wants it skinned up to look integrated into the site.  For the moment, I am using a script which will create an iframe element within a hidden div which auto plays, and when a new item is selected to play, it clears the div, and replaces it with a new iframe element.p  pThe next phase for the project requires a bit more integration though. I have been searching for javascript sound cloud integration, but all it seems to provide is creating a simple link that will play and pause the track only on the users request with a little bit of javascript to coax it into playing immediately.p  pAre there any other integrations for sound cloud via javascript that would allow for playing, pausing, stopping and getting information about the current play position like from an event, as well as other events like onstart, onstop, onpositionchange, etcp

I request your help in understanding this mechanism. For intra node communication, I understand that DSS makes use of only cloning because we are transferring objects in the same process space there is no need for communicating it over the network and we do not want any unwanted shared memory dependencies. However, during inter node communication, why do we need to clone  serialize From my understanding of serialization, when you serialize an object, the output you get at the end of serialization is completely independent of the object being serialized and can be used in isolation to construct a new object. Also, during serializing, I do not think we are going to update the original object and we are merely going to read from it. In such a scenario, will serialization alone not suffice Why do we need to clone before serializingp  pThanks,p  pVenkatp

Here they come but please note that Im not insisting that my ideas should be addressed in the answer if there is a better solution.p  pOne is doing queries on the referenced table to get the substitute value for each foreignkey field value in codegetValueAtcode. This doesnt seem too efficient even if cached and I wonder how should I synchronize this with editing and writing changed data back to the table.p  pThe other one is replacing the value of the field inwith the SQL query.

Is this the right way to do itp  precodeclass GameStateobject     def initself         self.variable1  1         self.variable2  2         self.list  [3, 4, 5]  gstate  GameState codepre  pAnd, if I wish to access the variables within gstate, what is the best way to go about doing itp  pPass gstate into the functionsclasses that need access Implement getters and call those Use gstate.variable1 directlyp  pOr is there a better wayp  pEDIT To be more specific, Im trying to write a game in python using pygame, and was thinking of putting my gamestate variables into a class so as to not have a bunch of global variables lying around. Im unsure of how to access those variables with good design so I dont run into trouble later.p

Negative 60676 pIm creating a Springbased Webapplication where I use Spring to add the implementation of a service to the defined interface. So far, so standard. Works fine.p  pI want to allow a user to overwrite applications behavior at runtime for his session. For that I want spring to change the implementation behind an interface depending on the usersession.p  pA use case for that are automatic testcases that run on INT and should test the output of an email created by the system. On INT there is an emailserivce configured sending emails to our mailserver. I dont want the testcase to have to check mails using a mailProtocol. I want in case automatic testcases are running to chenge the emailimplementation to write the email as comments to the HTML, so my tests can easily check the result. And so there are some more such cases where it would be nice to change the implementing bean for special circumstances.p  pIs there a concept in spring that helps me to implement such a feature or do I have to create that on my ownp  pAdditional information Its all about automated acceptance tests. That tests run on systems that we share with maunual testers.  Manual testers want to get a real email for their tests  Automatic tests reduce complexity by not receiving emails, just checking the emailcontent with less dependencies. There was no problem, if we had two systems, one configured for humans needs and one for automated tests needs. But thats not the case, so I need a way to change the systems behavior on runtime.p

That should force the browser to get a new copy of the class     file, since the archive is now at a different URI, and since the     archive is the .class file, it might work unless the user agent     disregards ARCHIVEs that are classes, which is entirely possiblep

Negative 60676 pBefore I define my problem in more detail, I think I should begin by explaining how Ive set everything up.p  pBasically I have a simple plane mesh, defined as such x, y, z, u, vp  precodevertices  Vector.ltNumbergt[     1, 1, 0, 0, 0,     1, 1, 0, 1, 0,     1,  1, 0, 1, 1,     1,  1, 0, 0, 1 ]  indices  Vector.ltuintgt[     0, 2, 1,     0, 3, 2 ] codepre  pNothing fancy going on here. But, the way I render this is where it all falls down. Its rendered by using two render passes the first one is a simple fragment shader that simply copies a color to the output and renders to a 512x512 texture. Still, everything is working fine. Its in the second render pass my problem lies.p  pThe second, and final, render pass, renders the same geometry, but the color of the fragmen pixel should be fetched from the texture rendered by the first pass. And that is where my problem comes in, I need a way to correctly calculate the position of the current pixel in screen space coordinates, or UV coordinates to be exact, so as to correctly extract them from the texture.p  pIve done some research on how to calculate this position, but somehowe Ive ended up creating a kaleidoscopelike effect. This effect, however, is only apparent when rotating the mesh on the X or Z axis, but not Y axis, as shown herep  pa hrefhttpimgur.comaqkdMx0 relnofollowRotation comparisonsap  pThe fragment program used for the second pass, the one that creates this effect, looks like thisp  precodediv ft0.x, v0.x, v0.w     Divide vertex positions v0.xy with clipspace position v0.w div ft0.y, v0.y, v0.w     to obtain screen coordinates as 1,1  mul ft0.x, ft0.x, fc0.x     Multiply positions ft0.xy by 0.5 fc0.x mul ft0.y, ft0.y, fc0.x   add ft0.x, ft0.x, fc0.x     Finally add 0.5 fc0.x to positions ft0.xy add ft0.y, ft0.y, fc0.x  tex ft1, ft0.xy, fs0 lt2d, nearest, repeat, nomipgt     Simply copy the pixel at ft0 from the render buffer fs0 mov oc, ft1 codepre  pOn a final note, Im quite new to all this. So I might be missing something obvious and as such I apologize in advance.p  pAnd if you want to have a look at the code in all its nonexisting glory, the Github repo can be found a hrefhttpsgithub.commacrohaulReddat relnofollowherea.p

Negative 60676 pIm assuming the answer is no but I havent been able to find confirmation.p  pIf it varies based on language, Im interested in both the HTTP headers e.g. PHPs codeSERVER[HTTPREFERER]code and JSs codedocument.referrercode, though I assume they come from the exact same place and will be identical.p  pIf I want to test that something has come specifically from codegoogle.comcode, is it safe to do a regex match with code.google.comcode, or might something come after code.comcode p  pI know that HTTP headers can be easily spoofed, but I might as well make this as accurateairtight as possible for those who arent doing anything underhanded.p

Negative 60676 pI am using Fixed Product Taxes FPT which we are calling a Service Fee to charge a 4 Service Fee for each item in the shopping cart. So if someone buys a quantity of 2, they are charged 8 extra.p  pThis works great, but when I apply a Promo Code Shopping Cart Price Rule that should zero out the total for each item including removal of the Service fee, it does not recalculate the Grand Total in the shopping cart, even though the discount appears and is calculated correctly.

Negative 60676 pSo there are tons of examples alike to invoke server methods from client side using jQuery AJAX. Once the HTTP 1.1 connection keeps alive, the client send GET or POST request to receive the data as soon as possible. If connection is not alive, client recreates it and initiate the request. With an additional delay due to connection overhead or errors.p  pIm looking for vice versa technics. In terms of C language  send and recv functions on server side when connection exists. Server sends data by the existing connection to the client or all the clients connected by the time. The client catches data and updatesmodifies its DOM.p  pAny jQuery AJAX example links, thoughts, restrictions or explanations, please.p  pUPD The best option will be the simplest. Say, using CGI and jQuery methods, if possible.p

Negative 60676 pWhat would you recommend as a best practice to separate production and development enviroments, but from the aspect of code itself.p  pExample imagine application using Active Directory which should authenticate based only on the domain controller, without taking local users and group setting from windows into account. For production enviroment, code should ignore local users and groups so that security hole is avoided. For development enviroment dev machines, build machines..., these local settings should be allowed for easier development  testing whatever lets say setting up a domain controller for tests is somewhat expensive, and local group participation can be changes easily so that developers could test around different test cases.p  pThe concrete example I have stated here is not important, the situation that could occur because of anything similar what should be enabled  disabled in the real production is importatnt. And also, bear in mind that I am not talking about having different config files for the application, the setting for development enviroment should somehow be completely hidden from the customers because it would allow some very serious security problems.p

Negative 60676 pI may have worded my title poorly so i hope this explanation sums my question up. p  pI have an email template page that allows users to enter in information to set up a custom email.  p  pThere is a second table at the bottom which lists previously created templates.  p  pI have some jquery in place that when a user clicks a previously created email template, it populates the top table with all of that information.  Essentially, a user can save the table and let all of the information update instead of making a new template.  p  pNOTE  everything populates correctly in FireFox, and everything updates correctly.br When I click the email names in IE, everything populates correctly but three check boxes.  Each checkbox should display as checked if the value pulled from the database is YES.br Otherwise, it is left unchecked.  In IE, either all of the checkboxes are checked, or none of them are checked.  p  pFor reference, please check out my previous post a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions18192876needassistancewithwindowonloadandieNeed assistance with window.onload and IEap  pHere is the jquery I currently have in place.p  precodewindow.onload, function      .test.onclick, function      var id  this.html     .getincludesadminPagesUpdateEmail.inc.phpselectionid  id, functiondata          test.htmldata                codepre  pHere is an example of one of the checkboxes that is displaying incorrectly.p  precodeltphp  ifemail[copyuser]  YES  echo  ltinput typecheckbox nameuser iduser valueYES checked gtAutocopy User   ifemail[copyuser]  NO  email[copyuser]    echo  ltinput typecheckbox nameuser iduser valueYES gtAutocopy User   gt codepre  pI did not post my query string as it works properly in firefox.p  pThanks in advance for all suggestions.p

Hint Use loops within loops.  basically it should make a square box, so if you give it the number boxSize  5 the output is a box with dimensions 5x5. the outline is made of asterisks but the inside is emptyp  pheres what I have code wise so farp  precodeimport java.util.Scanner  public class Box       public static void mainString[]args              numrows and numcols are equal however the spacing is differnt         Scanner input  new ScannerSystem.in         System.out.printEnter an even number 224               int boxSize  input.nextInt          int numRows  boxSize         int numCols  numRows          This program demonstrates compound decisions with the logical and operator ampamp         asks if the number is less than or equal to 24 and greater than or equal to 2 and that the remainder is 0          when divided by 2, checks if its an even number like it should be          ifboxSize gt 2 ampamp boxSize lt 24 ampamp boxSize2  0                         nested loops are used to print out the asterisk in the correct pattern             forint r  0 rltnumRows r                                  System.out.println                 forint c  0 cltnumCols c                                                       System.out.print                                                                      This program demonstrates compound decisions with the logical or    operator         checks if any of the following are true         if one or more is true then that means that it is an incorrect number         then reprompts the user to put in a new number then checks again         ifboxSizelt2boxSizegt24boxSize 2  0                      System.out.printlnValue must be an even number from 224          codepre  pBasically my problem is I dont know what to put in the loops and where to get the shape.

Negative 60676 pI have a few functions in a class. For each function, I want to be able to specify what if anything should be called before executing it, and what if anything to be called after executing it.p  pFor example, suppose my functions are a, b, c, d, and e. I want to do something like the followingp  precodebefore [a, b, c], execute beforefunc after [d, e], execute afterfunc codepre  pIs there a gem or a technique I can use to accomplish the abovep  pBackgroundp  pMy class is basically a class that reads files from ftp. I have declared an ftp variable that is initialized when a class instance is created, and then when needed it tries to read from ftp, or do other operations on ftp. Now if the operations happen close together it works but otherwise it gives a timeout. So before each function i want to close the current ftp, and reopen a new connection and use that. when the function ends i want to close the ftp connection. I have already written most functions so want to just declare two functions, one to open connections and one to close connections.p

Negative 60676 pFellow devs, I am having trouble with AutoLayout in Interface Builder Xcode 5  iOS 7. Its very basic and its very important so I think everyone should know how this properly works.

Then I add a Top Space constraint to the UILabel no problem and I can even pin height  width of the label, changes nothing, but should be unneccessary due to the Labels intrinsic sizep  pstrongThe trouble starts when I add a trailing constraint to the UILabelstrongp  pE.g., Trailing Space to Superview Equals 25p  pNow two warnings occur  and I dont understand whyp  pstrongAstrong Scrollable Content Size Ambiguity Scroll View has ambiguous scrollable content height  widthp  pstrongBstrong Misplaced Views Label Expected x 67 Actual x 207p  pI did this minimal example in a freshly new project which you can download and I attached a screenshot. As you can see, Interface Builder expects the Label to sit outside of the UIScrollViews boundary the orange dashed rectangle. Updating the Labels frame with the Resolve Issues Tool moves it right there.p  pPlease note If you replace the UIScrollView with a UIView, the behaviour is as expected the Labels frame is correct and according to the constraint. So there seems to either be an issue with UIScrollView or I am missing out on something important.p  pWhen I run the App without updating the Labels frame as suggested by IB it is positioned just fine, exactly where its supposed to be and the UIScrollView is scrollable. If I DO update the frame the Label is out of sight and the UIScrollView does not scroll.p  pstrongHelp me ObiWan Kenobi Why the ambiguous layout Why the misplaced viewstrongp  pYou can download the sample project here and try if you can figure out whats going on a hrefhttpsgithub.comWirsing84AutoLayoutProblemhttpsgithub.comWirsing84AutoLayoutProblemap  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comeqoUh.png altIllustration of the problem in Interface Builderp

Negative 60676 pCan anyone explain to me why I am able to achieve a higher transfer speed over my network with a 1158KB file compared to a 256KB file Basically im looking into packet performance and the speeds achieved with different file sizes. If I send the small file with a packet size of 4096 Bytes, I achieve a transfer speed of 196.85 KBs, but with the larger file, using the same packet size, i achieve a transfer speed of 951.48KBs. What is the reason for such a difference Is it just due to the larger file spending longer on the wire and being able to gather speed as it were p  pUpdate  In response to one users question, protocol is UDP and a Local network. Two computers with gigabit NICs connected by a gigabit switch. Measuring speed with a custom java program to measure speed in response to packet size change. p
Negative 60676 pI know this has been asked many a time but none of the solutions given have worked for me. The roughasguts basic example can be seen a hrefhttpbloogum.netwptestingtest1.html relnofollowherea and a handy visual guide a hrefhttpbloogum.nettempemptydiv.jpg relnofollowherea.p  pSo its the brown div on the left thats giving issues. Its completely empty, purely decorative, with nothing in it but the background. The pink ones are fine, they do exactly what I tell them. Obviously, for the brown div, making the height100 only stretches to the bottom of the browser window. If the content of the pink divs makes the page scroll, the brown doesnt go any further down.p  pstrongSolutions that havent workedstrongp  pemFaux Columnsem As you can see from the handy visual guide, Ive got the content divs that basically make it a sidescrolling layoutcurrently up to 10 divs extend out to the right by around 10,000 pixels. Since faux columns basically require making a background image with the column included, and because my backgrounds are patterns, the resulting 10,000px wide image would seriously impact load time.p  pemSpecify pixel height of brown divem The content divs arent a standard height. On some pages the longest is only a few hundred pixels below the bottom of the browser window, on others its a few thousand. Making the brown div xthousand pixels high to cover them all is untidy and lazy and I really dont want to have to resort to that.p  pemdual background imagesem Something I found with CSS3 is that you can set two background images for the body background. I nearly had it with this Is there a way of specifying exact details for the separate images eg set whitepaper.jpg to repeat, then brownpaper.jpg to repeaty only If that can be done then Ive got it, but so far as I can see both images have to have the same attributes, which would mean once again making the column image extend for thousands of pixels, and also make it a .png to give it transparency to see the white behind.p  pemSetting height of body and html to 100em Didnt do anything. It actually broke something in the behaving pink divs.p  pstrongThe code that mattersstrongp  precodeltDOCTYPE htmlgt lthtmlgt ltheadgt   ltscript srchttpajax.googleapis.comajaxlibsjquery1jquery.min.jsgtltscriptgt   ltstyle typetextcssgt   html, body height100 margin0 padding0   body      fontfamily conquerorsans, Tahoma, verdana, sansserif     fontsize 18pt     color 9e8166     letterspacing2px     backgroundcolor e6e0d5     backgroundimageurlimageslayoutwhitepaper.jpg     backgroundrepeat repeat     backgroundpositiontop left     toptrim      positionabsolute     left90px     top0px     height20px     width550px     backgroundimageurlimageslayoutbrownpaper.jpg   mainheader      positionabsolute     left90px     top90px     height100     bottom0px     marginbottom0px     width550px     backgroundimageurlimageslayoutbrownpaper.jpg    ltstylegt ltheadgt ltbodygt  ltheader idtoptrimgt ltheadergt  ltheader idmainheadergt ltheadergt  ltdiv stylepositionabsolute top400px left700px width20pxgt a dsg asd gf asdfg as dfg dfsag df g dfa g afd ga df ga fg a sg a g ag a ga fsa fas dg     a sfdg asd g asd ga dsg adsg as dg as g ar ga rg a g asd ads f asd f dsf asd  dsaf asd f sda fasd f ads fsd  sd dsf asdf a sdgsda f asd a ds fa sdf ads  fads f as d asdf sd a sdf asd f asdf asd f asd f ds fsda f f d ads fad sf  asd asd sd f asd f a f ds asd fa fa ss ad ltdivgt  ltbodygt lthtmlgt codepre  pstrongThoughts on how it might be fixedstrong Can I set the div to be fixed when scrolling up and down, but scroll left and rightp  pIve come to the conclusion that this just cant be done with CSS.

Negative 60676 pOFBiz by default works as a collections of small webapps each with its own front controller.  OFBiz webapps typically depend on a lot of common modules.  Typically, modules under specialpurpose or hotdeploy would end up depending on pretty much all of the modules under strongframeworkstrong and strongapplicationsstrong...  with the embedded container, all libraries go into the catalina shared library class loader but if ofbiz needs to be deployed in a different container, there is simply no easy way.  the only options i believe are p  ol lipackage ofbiz as an EAR with a strongEARlibstrong or strongEARAPPINFlibstrong so that all webapps have access to a common set of EAR level classpath resources.. typically each moduless strongconfigstrong, stronglibstrong and the all important strongofbizmodule.jarstrongli lieach webapp packages each of the required jars into its own strongWEBINFlibstrong.. too much duplication and also increases the filesystem footprint in a senseli liuse the application system classpath in lieu of catalina shared.lib folder  which means the JVM has to be dedicated to ofbiz as its jars would otherwise interfere with other sibling deployments and potentially even with the container itself, typically things such as XML, XSL, STAX apis etc..li ol  pgiven that ofbiz load most of the resources using the filesystem strongofbiz.homestrong  strongcomponentstrong resulution.  What the webapp really needs access to in a convential servlet context kind of way is thep  ul licontroller.xmlli liclasspath resources  across the various ofbizmodule.jar in shared.lib.  typically, each moduless strongconfigstrong, stronglibstrong and the all important strongofbizmodule.jarstrongli liimported component webapp resources like other controller.xml for various modules.  most importantly the strongframeworkcommonwebcommonWEBINFcontroller.xmlstrong that provides the boiler plate security implementation like checkLogin and autoLogin....li ul  pI was wondering if we could somehow package multiple webapps into a single monolithic webapp using front controller namespacing so that the war maps to a single root content like say strongstrong strongROOTstrong on tomcat and strongcontentstrong, strongwebtoolsstrong, strongcatalogstrong, strongecommercestrong etc. are mere URL namespacessubcontexts rather than separate webapps.  strongframeworkcommonwebcommonWEBINFcontroller.xmlstrong could become the root controller for  ROOT in tomcat and provide checkLogin, autoLogin etc to all webapps without each controller having to import that controller.xmlp  pThis would allow us to simply the deployment model when we would want to move to other containers like say weblogic, jboss et al where we would be better of building a single webapp with all of its dependencies neatly packaged into its strongWEBINFlibstrong such that it could coexist with other deployments in the same container without interfering with their dependencices and their versions... p  pI believe struts had this kind of modular namespacing where there could be a root level struts.xml our case controller.xml and each module would be a folder with its own modulestruts.xml or modulestrutsmodule.xml etc...p  pi personally feel this would be helpful.. i have not thought enough about the downsides.  there could be many  i honestly dont know.  I have not given enough thought to themes either.. developers clearly would not like to see any change in the way code is laid out or organized.. so with some minor  changes in the core MVC code in the framework, we could potentially support this kind of deployment using a simple ant build script that stages candidate webapps into a merged monolithic webapp...p  pi was hoping to see a debate on the merits of this idea...  i would even be willing to invest some time into making this work if i get some direction and inputs.. p

Negative 60676 pIm developing a REST API in order to transfer data from a client application to a web application.p  pSo far it all worked well I created my entity objects in the client application and then serialized them with Jersey into XMLJSON and called PUT, on the other end a Resource listened for PUT and magically serialized them into Objects ready to be persisted with JPA.p  pBelow is a sample of an entity Album with annotations and the associated Resource.p  precodeXmlRootElement Entity public class Album      Id     private String id     private String name      ManyToManycascade  CascadeType.ALL     private CollectionltPhotosgt photos       getterssetters     ApplicationPathwebresources Pathalbum Stateless public class AlbumResource extends Application      PUT     Pathadd     Consumes              MediaType.APPLICATIONJSON, MediaType.APPLICATIONXML          public Response addAlbumAlbum album              try                      getAlbumEJB.createalbum                  catch Exception ex                      Logger.getLoggerAlbumResource.class.getName.logLevel.SEVERE, null, ex                  if exception                      return Response.status201.entityalbum.build                  else                      return Response.status403.entityalbum.build                codepre  pThe above worked well even though according to some sites this is a classic antipattern of Conflating models and resources see for instance a hrefhttpjacobian.orgwritingrestworstpractices relnofollowhttpjacobian.orgwritingrestworstpracticesa. Their reasoning is that the above example would collapse, indeed to update an Album name I would need to resend a PUT with a whole photos collection, in a more articulated example I would end sending tons of useless data just to honour relations between objects.p  pThey however dont point out a regular solution so I came up with this rather convoluted solution to keep mapping models and resources together and thus exploit automatic serializationp  pI would basically send from the client a new entity RESTAlbum where instead of a collection of Photos as the Album entity it would contain a collection of links to photosp  precodeltAlbumgt     ltidgt73ltidgt     ltnamegtGreat Albumltnamegt     ltphotosCollectiongt     ltphotogt       lthrefgthtttpexample.comphoto211lthrefgt     ltphotogt     ltphotogt       lthrefgthtttpexample.comphoto232lthrefgt     ltphotogt     ltphotosCollectiongt ltAlbumgt codepre  pon the server side end I would serialize RESTAlbum and would fetch each photo entity based on its URL and construct manually an Album entity which I would be able to serialize with JPA.p  pIs the above the only way to go p  pIt seems like quite a lot of work to create all this custom classes just to serialize relations and strangely all the web is full of REST purists but noone talking about issues like this.p

Negative 60676 pBefore I start, I want to say that this is related to a Bukkit plugin.p  pI have tried searching this all over the web, but I cant just find a good way to do it.p  pI am trying to build a plugin that can connect to a database usually MySQL, and locally keep track of the time of the database, even if it goes down. The plugin is a ban management system, for multiple servers. The situation is this one The timezone of the database server is different from the time on the servers, and each server has its own timezone. Theres only 1 database, so, the best way to do it is keeping track of the time using the time of the database. But, if the database goes down, a thread will run until the database comes back and the record is successfully inserted. If I were to use UNIXTIMESTAMP on the column that stores when the ban was created, if the database went down, it would only start counting after the database came back. So, breaking it down, what I want is a way to keep track of the time of the database, even if the database goes down and comes back up.p  pThanks in advance.p

Negative 60676 pI decided to put this question up because I got to a point where Im pretty confused about how emAngularem and the more delicate parts of emJavaScriptem work. I try to formulate my question so it can be broken down.p  ol lipThe standard way of exposing variables from a controller is to declare them on codescopecode.p  precode.controllerMyCtrl, functionscope    scope.value  5   codepre  pThen from a template reference it like this, assuming codeMyCtrlcode is the controllerp  precodevalue codepre  pWhen I use the controllerAs syntax, for example with codeuiroutercode like thisp  precodestatemystate,    templateUrl partialssome.html,   controller  MyCtrl as ctrl  codepre  pI can still get codevaluecode with codevaluecode so this works. However if I declare another value like thisp  precode.controllerMyCtrl, functionscope    scope.value  5   this.otherValue  10  codepre  pThen with codecontroller MyCtrlcode syntax, I can strongnotstrong reference codeotherValuecode. However with the codecontroller MyCtrl as ctrlcode syntax, I can reference them like thisp  precodevalue ctrl.otherValue codepre  pemSummary of point 1em I can always reference codevaluecode like codevaluecode but can only reference codeotherValuecode if the controller is named, so codectrl.otherValuecode.pli lipMy second point is about functions and the topic is similar to point 1. Suppose I define two functionsp  precode.controllerMyCtrl, functionscope    scope.myFunc  function    this.otherFunc  function    codepre  pNow if again as above I use the codecontroller MyCtrlcode syntax, from the template I can call codemyFunccodep  precodeltbutton ngclickmyFuncgt codepre  pBut this will strongnotstrong workp  precodeltbutton ngclickotherFuncgt codepre  pNow with codecontroller MyCtrl as ctrlcode syntax, calling codemyFunccode like these will strongnotstrong workp  precodeltbutton ngclickctrl.myFuncgt ltbutton ngclickmyFuncgt codepre  pBut I can call codeotherFunccode by referencing the controller with the namep  precodeltbutton ngclickctrl.otherFuncgt codepre  pemSummary of point 2em I can only call codescope.code functions like Im used to when I dont use the controllerAs syntax, and can only call codethis.code functions when I reference the named controller. This is in contrast with empoint 1em where I can reference the codescope.code variable from either named or unnamed controller definition.pli ol  pI know controller constructor functions are for setting up the codescopecode, and templates should use the codescopecode, but what is different about named controllers then Im guessing the controllerAs syntax causes that custom name to point to not the emscopeem but the controller function itself, but I would be grateful if somebody would clear this up for me.p  pI also think these behaviours are not related to just emuirouterem but its generally how it works, so I would also like to knowp  ul liWhat should be set on codescopecode and what shouldntli liWhat should be set on the function itself and what shouldntli liIs there a way to access codescope.code functions when using named controllersli liAny advice or some obvious point Im missingli ul  pThank you for your time in advance.p

Negative 60676 pI am using Angular UI Bootstrap a hrefhttpangularui.github.iobootstrapmodalModal boxa. When the modal opens the body has a scroll. When I scroll the content behind the modal also scrolls. p  pI can set overflow hidden to the body tag and this solves the issue. However if I have alot of content within my modal I need a scroll to show. This scroll should not be inside the modal i.e When I use the page scroll the modal should only scroll and not the content.  a hrefhttpplnkr.coedit7so09g5TOpw6VL65nXFKppreviewPlunker hereap

I think Ive got all the DNS, modrewrite, htaccess, etc stuff down, but Ive got another problem. p  pThe problem is when a guest nonuser visits a users website user.domain.com. An example to illustrate thisp  ol liGuest types url with subdomain btw, Im using php and controller dynamically loads up the user website based on the subdomain.li liGuest clicks on a link on the page and gets a new page from server. Problem is that the new page doesnt have the subdomain anymore as all the links are the same. Only the content is different and dynamically loaded.li ol  pSo the question is, How do I keep track of which subdomain the guest is on Since the client is a guest and not a logged in user, I cant look at the logged in users information. p  pI am just interested in ideas of what the best implementation would be. Should I keep some variable in the session and keep checking that on each page Should I pass a POSTGET variable with each link and then have the controller read that p

Finally it draws a circle over the circular blob. The issue is the code is able to find blobs no problem, but its not able to find the circular ones.

Negative 60676 pI have a Pager extended from AbstractPager in which every time on range or row count changed I recreate NavLinks contained in it so pager looks like thisbr 1 2 3  N1 N N1  M2 M1 Mbr My algorithm works fine but when I start clicking on links fast like really furiously by the time one RangeChange event is performing CellTable to which my pager is attached shows spin trying to fetch data on given page theres already another ones coming to the EventBus. It results in changing current page back and forth in an infinite loop.br I tried to make paging links enabled only when current page is competely fetched by using Scheduler.get.scheduleDeferred and .scheduleFinally but with no luck.br My temporary solution is to enable paging links after 500 ms by using Scheduler.get.scheduleFixedDelay, but I want to know how to get the exact moment of data on the current page being fully fetched.br Thanks.p

Simply overwriting the file didnt work for some reason.  Because of this, its very possible that my previous attempts at this may have very well been valid solutions that I just thought werent working.

Negative 60676 pI have a group of images in my resources.

I dont want to be one of those guys that copypastes code and doesnt know why it works and I have spent quite some time trying to figure this one out and havent come to a conclusion.p  pThe code in Eclipse if it mattersp  precode    rand1  int Math.roundMath.random  5     dice1.setImageResourceR.drawable.die1  rand1 codepre  pSo we get a number from 0 to 5 and add it to the resId of the first image in the naming sequence to randomly pull one of the 6 die images. Makes sense, but how can you be sure that the images in the resources folder are assigned resIDs sequentially like that  For that matter, is there easy to understand documentation on how the compiler assigns the integer resource IDs  I feel like I may be missing something simple here.  Thank you for your time guys and gals.p  pIf this is not a stable solution it seems to work fine once compiled so far is there a better way to implement such behaviorp

Negative 60676 pCan someone point me in the direction of algorithms I should study to solve the following taskp  pI have about 10 variables. They constantly change, I record their changes. I need to find different places in the data where the movement of the variables is similar in both places x1 goes up 50, x2 goes down 20, x3 stays in place, and so on for all 10. Say this happens at time point 15 and again at time point 225. I need to recognize that pattern, therefore I need to produce a signature for each general category of such a sum of movements. p  pOptimally, this signature should extended to reasonably long rows x1 up 15, down 20, up 30, but always for all 10 variables together. In finance they probably need to do this for stock analysis, but what algorithms do they employp  pEDIT Im looking into the multidimensional trees in the first answer, but now Im also considering an alternative path since the values have to add up to a hundred, and I can be increasingly approximate with higher values anything over 50 just scores as over half, for example, then I can use the fact that the higher shelves can only be occupied by a very limited number of the variables only one over half, only 3 in 3050 category, etc to reduce the total amount of possible variations for each recorded distribution. I could construct a hash function to give a key for each distribution and then include with it the keys for each distribution that follows the original distribution.p

Negative 60676 pI come up with this question that was asked to write a code in C. So, I need to use the C synchronization primitives. p  pQ Create a method e.g. foo which accept a integer as a argument and print on console. This method is accessed by multiple threads. If two or more threads call the method with same value then only one thread should allow to print the value other threads should wait. If values are different then all threads should allow to print the value.p  pMy suggestion is using a global hashtable lets say, unorderedmapi, semaphore map. So, when fooi is called, foo checks the hashtable. If i is not in the hashtable, we add map[i]semaphore0. When i printed, map[i].release is called to allow other waiting threads with input i continue their print operation. On the other hand, if i is already in the hash, it means that other thread with the same input is running, so it should wait via map[i].aquire. p  pHope you could help me to find a better solution or a corrected version of this proposal.  p

This would be a bit like creating a new function with a closure at runtime if the JS called a functor constructor with parameters of other functors. Then this functor would entirely be a C object with the procedure stored within I think. I will need to work this out in my head for a bit.p

Negative 60676 pIn portrait mode, my codeViewPagercode has 3 fragments A, B, C but in landscape mode, it has only 2 fragments A and C. So I create 2 codeFragmentStatePagerAdaptercodes for each mode. The problem is when screen orientation changed, codeViewPagercode restores and uses previous fragments of old orientation. For example, when change orientation from portrait to landscape, codeViewPagercode now shows 2 fragments A, B instead of A and C. I know why this happen but cant find a good solution for this.p  pMy current workaround is to use different ids for codeViewPagercode eg idviewpagerportrait for portrait and idviewpagerlandscape for landscape layout to prevent from reusing fragments but this cause me a memory leak because old fragment will not be destroyed and still be kept in memory.p  pI have tried some workaround like call super.onCreatenull in activitys codeonCreatecode, or remove fragments of codeViewPagercode in  activitys codeonSaveInstanceStatecode but they all makes my app crash.p  pSo my question is how to avoid reusing one or many fragments in codeFragmentStatePagerAdaptercode when orientation changedp  pAny helps will be appreciated. Thank in advance.p

Negative 60676 pI currently have an app on the Android Google Play market which has a few in app purchases available. I am looking to add another one which would be a subscription to give them extra functionality not only in the Android app, but also on my website too. The availability of the feature on the website would be tied into the Android app and if the stop subscribing in the app then I would want to stop access on the website too.p  pIs there a way to check if they have purchased an in app upgrade using asp.net preferably with c, however open to other methods and if so could you point me in the right direction as to what I need to do pleasep  pMy attempts at Googling this has returned no results so I am not sure if this is possible or if my Googling is just rubbishp  pThanks.p

However, my remote function to get this information is quite complex, it returns something like thisp  precode prefix ba,   weblog gmazza,   tagcounts [      tag  bat, count  2 ,       tag  banana, count  1 ,       tag  band, count  1 ,       tag  bar, count  1    ]  codepre  p...requiring me to go to the array at the third element tagcounts and collect the values for the string tag and return an array of those values.  Granted, the most sensible solution would be to change that function to a format that autocomplete can directly work with, but Id like to learn how to write a parsing function with JQuery to change the format of the returned JSON array, i.e., forp  precode.autocomplete     source functionrequest, response          .getJSONmyURL,  term ba , functiondata ...     ,     ...  codepre  pHow can I create a success functiondata that will give me the desired array that autocomplete needs  Any tips, suggestions, code examples would be appreciated, this is proving more difficult to search on the Net than I thought.  One particular problem Im having is that most success functions I see are just outputting to the console or creating HTML elements, I need it to return a value JSON array that will get used as the response above to my source function.p
Negative 60676 pI have a data set which is annotated by Collins parser. Right now, I am keeping the POS of each word in the data set as a feature. The problem is that I dont need finegrained POS. So, I have combined some of the tags. For example, I assume all VBD,VBP,VBZ,VBG under the category of Verb. And for nouns, I assume NNP and NNS as Noun category.p  pSo, here is the list of POS tags that I have after doing all combinationsp  blockquote   pVB, NN, TO, JJ, IN, EX, RB, WP, PRP, MD, UH, WRB, WDT, RP, CD, POS, DT, PRP, WP, CC, RBRp blockquote  pNow, my question is where can I find a list of coarsegrained POS tags Is there any standard coarsegrained POS tag listp  pIn my system, If I dont combine other POS tags, I can get better results. I am wondering if I am allowed to keep my current list Or should I combine them as wellp  pThanks in advance,p

Negative 60676 pSorry for the long text, but I dont know how to explain this in shorter words...p  pToday I tried to find out, how C compilers internally deal with template code.p  pIf the same templated code is used from different separately compiled cpp files, then these objects will contain  of course  redundant code.

We dont want that the compiler throws away the unused code, so lets disable optimizationp  precodeclang O0 c b.cpp clang O0 c main.cpp clang o main main.o b.o codepre  pHaving a look at the objects a.o and main.o we will see, that both files contain a equivalent equivalent in terms of equivalent machine code functionp  precode0000000000000000 ltZ3fooIiETS0gt same in main.o and b.o    0   55                      push   rbp    1   48 89 e5                mov    rsp,rbp    4   89 7d fc                mov    edi,0x4rbp    7   8b 7d fc                mov    0x4rbp,edi    a   03 7d fc                add    0x4rbp,edi    d   89 f8                   mov    edi,eax    f   5d                      pop    rbp   10   c3                      retq   codepre  pAfter linking those objects together, redundant code is automatically thrown away.

This is due the fact that Weld internally is using a logger as well, stated in my loggingfile code20140813 125515.589 [main0] DEBUG Weld.java84 Method ltclinitgt  Logging Provider org.jboss.logging.Log4jLoggerProvidercode.p  pSince Im using codeorg.jboss.weld.environment.se.StartMaincode as main class, I do not have any influence on the logging capabilities of Weld. I now end up with 3 logging files as described in my log4j.properties on 2 different locations. Whereas one contains some Weld debug information and the other contains all the logging information from initialization and onward.p  pThus logically Id like to end up with only 1 directory with logging files, thus that Weld adjusts to the new log4j file location. Or to have log4j to copy the old logging contents, create new logging files  with old content and to delete the old logging files.p  pI do not want to use VM arguments, since I need to programmatically assign the logging locations.p

Negative 60676 pI have a sparse matrix in csr format which makes sense for my purposes, as it has lots of rows but relatively few columns, 8million x 90.p  pMy question is, whats the most efficient way to access a particular value from the matrix given a row,column tuple I can quickly get a row using codematrix.getrowrowcode, but this also returns 1row sparse matrix, and accessing the value at a particular column seems clunky. The only reliable method Ive found to get a particular matrix value, given the row and column, isp  precodematrix.getrowrow.todense.A1[column] codepre  pBut this seems overly verbose and complicated. Is there a simplerfaster method Im missingp

Furthermore I need to be able to query all codesubClassescode at once. To solve this, Im now using a selfmade autofield but, I dont like that DRY, KISS, etc and furthermore it probably is not thread safe yet.p  pSo if any pythonistadjangonista has an idea how to use the existing codeFieldscode to do this please let me know.p

Negative 60676 pI have my datagrid configured to show a custom tooltip for each row. p  pMy problem is that this tooltip is slightly aggressive for the user, and takes a good part of the screen I do not have the choice to reduce it. So in order to try to be less aggressive, I put a property to set the InitialShowDelay to 2000 ms, so that the tooltip appears 2 seconds after the user puts the mouse over a row.p  pIt works fine when the mouse is somewhere else, then enters to the datagrid and its over a row 2 seconds later the tooltip appears. But now, when moving to another row datagrid did not lose the focus, the tooltip for the other row immediately appears. So it does not look to take into account the InitialShowDelay property...p  pMy code is like thisp  precodeltDataGrid ...gt    ltDataGrid.RowStylegt       ltStyle TargetTypeDataGridRowgt              ltSetter PropertyToolTip ValueStaticResource TooltipTemplateStylegtltSettergt              ltSetter PropertyToolTipService.ShowDuration Value48000gtltSettergt              ltSetter PropertyToolTipService.InitialShowDelay Value2000gtltSettergt       ltStylegt     ltDataGrid.RowStylegt ltDataGridgt codepre  pDo you know any way to set a tooltip delay when moving from one row to another within the same datagridp  pThanks in advancep

Negative 60676 pIm having an issue with Ghost.py. The site I am trying to crawl has links for a paginated list that work with javascript, rather than direct hrefs. When I click the links, I cant really wait for selectors because the selectors are the same on each page, so ghost doesnt wait since the selector is already present. I cant assume I know what text will be on the next page, so waiting for text will not work. And waiting for page loaded wont work either. Its almost as though the javascript is not being executed.p  pGhost.py seems to have minimal documentation if you can call the examples on the website documentation so it is really difficult to work out what I can do, and what tools are available to me. Can anybody with more experience help me outp

Negative 60676 pI created a WPF form in Blend and now I want to bring this form into VS2012 so I can start putting code to the buttons, etc. I cannot open projects from VS2012 directly into blend the shortcut to do this isnt there, but I can edit my Blend project in VS2012. When I do this and run the project in VS2012 I see the form as expected which Ive created in blend. The problem is in VS I cannot find the actual form anywhere to work with, I can only edit the files themselves. Not sure if Im doing something silly, but Im trying to click into buttons to create events like I would normally. Any ideas what Im missingp  pWhen I open other WPF projects that I started in VS2012 not blend the form comes right up for me to interact with.p

Negative 60676 pWe are working on a windows application which caters to an engineering calculation which are essentially very long running. So we are basically trying to keep the calculation module separate and working in a separate worker thread and pass it an Action delegate in method signature which will be invoked to report the calculation progress in the UI. The delegate handler declared in the UI will be updating the UI. We found that while a huge loop is running in the calculation, the UI is not showing the periodic progress and only displaying the final result. If a Thread Sleep for 1 millisecond is introduced in the calculation loop, the UI is getting updated correctly. This is not expected behavior as we are executing the calculation using a separate Task and updating the UI using BeginInvoke calls.p  pI have created a simple application to demonstrate our approach and code so that it is easier to understand.

Negative 60676 pHello I am using restkit and I always used the mainqueuecontext for almost everything and that includes creating new entities because the stuff I worked on didnt happen asynchronously and most of the writes were quite small so there was no impact on performance. This is however different now.p  pIve been reading up everywhere in regards to the best way to use restkits contexts but cannot find a good example.p  pI know that the mainQueueManagedObjectContext is used on the main queue for user interface and my fetchresultcontroller users that. I also use it to map data into my database from restkit.p  pI also know that the persistentStoreManagedObjectContext is the parent context and is used to do background work.p  pDoes that mean I can just infer this context to do any background work such as creating multiple entities and modifying them  or I should spawn other contexts off the persistentStoreManagedObjectContext and do work there What would be the benefit of doing the later.p  pThanks.p

Negative 60676 pIm using Selenium WebDriverJS via node to do some automated testing.  I have a test Im trying to write to work on multiple browsers, and it works fine on Chrome and Firefox, but in IE version 11, 32bit, I keep having the consistent problem where I cant switch to other windows besides the main one.  p  pBasically, as part of the test Ill have it click a button that opens up a link in a new window, then I attempt to switch to that window and continue.  Getting all the window handles and then using switchTo to switch has worked fine in the other browsers, but not IE.  Using the same method gets me the errorp  pcodeUnknownError null value in entry namenull   ...   async task   WebDriver.switchTo.windowundefinedcodep  pSo I ranp  pcodedriver.getAllWindowHandles.thenfunction handles      console.loghandles.length  codep  pto see if the windows were appearing.  And every time, the result has been 1, being only the main window.  I can see the new windows that have been opened, but webdriver cant for whatever reason.  Is there anything more I need to do to get these windows to be visible to the driver  Any sort of workaroundp  pI know that IE requires some settings to work properly with Selenium.  My protected mode settings are fine, and Ive done the FEATUREBFCACHE key in the registry.  It just seems to be unable to find any new windows.p  pUsing IE 11 with the 32bit driver, and Windows 7 64bit.  Again, my language is javascript.  Let me know if there is more info you need to answer.p

Negative 60676 pSo I need to right a program in MIPS assembly language. My instructions are as followsp  blockquote   pWrite a merge program that merges two ordered lists of integers into a new ordered list.br   For example, given two ordered lists 9,6,4,1 and 7,3,2,0 as input arguments, merge should produce a new list 9,7,6,4,3,2,1,0 which is also ordered. Another example could be to merge 6,0,3 and 9,5,4,0,2 to produce 9,6,5,4,0,0,2,3.p      pThe merge program assumes that the two input lists in decreasing order of integers are stored in the data area. It loads the integers and merges them into an ordered list. The resulting ordered list e.g. 9,6,5,4,0,0,2,3 should be stored back into the data area.p      pIt is at your own choice how the data area i.e. the lists is arranged, and whether the resulting list is overwritten onto the original two lists. But be sure to give meaningful labels and clearly indicate using label or comments where the merged list is stored. Before your program terminates, it should print out the merged list which should be in decreasing order. p      pNote Please do NOT implement any sorting algorithm You will receive a grade of zero 0 if you do so.p blockquote  pI think the instructions are really unclear here. Im not sure whether I should give the lists or assume these lists already exist. Any examples or adviceprograms would help greatlyp

Negative 60676 pIm pretty good with html and css but when it comes to javascript  it just slips right off me. Ive found great answers here but if it doesnt match exactly what I need Im helpless to adapt it. Heres the project so far...p  pI have a group of articles with the classes titlediv story1, titlediv story2, titlediv story3, etc.  The user only sees the first few lines of each.  The remainder of the lines in each article have the class hiddendiv.  When user clicks anywhere on an article the hiddendiv for that article is revealed with a slideDown. Click again and the hiddendiv is hidden again with slideUp. Click on another article and the first article slides up while the new one slides down, and so on. p  pSo far so good  except I found that many users dont click unless they are somehow alerted that there is more to see. So, to cue users, I added the text Read more at the end of the visible lines of each article.  I gave this text the class fauxlink and styled it like a hyperlink. p  pThe problem is that I want the text on the clicked article to toggle from Read more to Read less depending on the revealed state of the hiddendiv. p  pI hope someone can help me finish what Ive started here.p  pHeres the javascript Ive been using and it works great except for that last little problem described abovep

Negative 60676 pThe official a hrefhttpdeveloper.android.comtraininganimationzoom.html relnofollowZooming a Viewa tutorial uses an codeAnimatorSetcode to zoom into a codeViewcode. It creates the illusion of downward movement as the view expands.

Ive basically tried to reverse the procedure in the tutorialp  precodeprivate void zoomImageFromThumbReversefinal View expandedImageView, int imageResId, final int duration       If theres an animation in progress, cancel it immediately and proceed with this one.            if mCurrentAnimator  null          mCurrentAnimator.cancel            Load the lowresolution zoomedout image.     final ImageView thumbView  ImageView findViewByIdR.id.thumbbutton1     thumbView.setImageResourceimageResId       Calculate the starting and ending bounds for the zoomedin image. This step      involves lots of math. Yay, math.     final Rect startBounds  new Rect     final Rect finalBounds  new Rect     final Point globalOffset  new Point       The start bounds are the global visible rectangle of the container view i.e. the FrameLayout, and the      final bounds are the global visible rectangle of the thumbnail. Also      set the container views offset as the origin for the bounds, since thats      the origin for the positioning animation properties X, Y.     findViewByIdR.id.container.getGlobalVisibleRectstartBounds, globalOffset     thumbView.getGlobalVisibleRectfinalBounds     startBounds.offsetglobalOffset.x, globalOffset.y     finalBounds.offsetglobalOffset.x, globalOffset.y       Adjust the start bounds to be the same aspect ratio as the final bounds using the      center crop technique. This prevents undesirable stretching during the animation.      Also calculate the start scaling factor the end scaling factor is always 1.0.     float startScale     if float finalBounds.width  finalBounds.height             gt float startBounds.width  startBounds.height           Extend start bounds horizontally         startScale  float startBounds.height  finalBounds.height         float startWidth  startScale  finalBounds.width         float deltaWidth  startWidth  startBounds.width  2         startBounds.left  deltaWidth         startBounds.right  deltaWidth      else           Extend start bounds vertically         startScale  float startBounds.width  finalBounds.width         float startHeight  startScale  finalBounds.height         float deltaHeight  startHeight  startBounds.height  2         startBounds.top  deltaHeight         startBounds.bottom  deltaHeight            Hide the expandedimage and show the zoomedout, thumbnail view. When the animation begins,      it will position the zoomedin view in the place of the thumbnail.     expandedImageView.setAlpha0f     thumbView.setVisibilityView.VISIBLE       Set the pivot point for SCALEX and SCALEY transformations to the topleft corner of      the zoomedin view the default is the center of the view.     thumbView.setPivotX0f     thumbView.setPivotY0f       Construct and run the parallel animation of the four translation and scale properties      X, Y, SCALEX, and SCALEY.

I have a second development laptop that I used to perform bug fixes and such when deployment time came where the system also worked properly. p  pWhen I went to deploy the system on a production machine I set up MySQL and imported the database from a dump made off of the laptop. When the program, which had run successfully on both of my development machines, attempted to execute the error data too long for column was generated causing my inserts to fail. This doesnt make sense to me unless mysql has a setting that makes the bittinyintint1 behave in odd ways from install to install. I was able to make this function properly by simply setting the field to an INT INT11 it think but I should not have had to do this and I would like to know why this happened. Perhaps someone could clarify how BIT data types work in MYSQL.p

Negative 60676 pIm trying to use a structure to hold a pointer to a data block that I change sometimes when a file is updated, the idea being to free the old data block, malloc a new one of the right size, and assign the pointer to pointer in the structure to the pointer returned by malloc, and this is how I thought I should do it.

In fact in the larger program that I pared down to make this test program, its not seg faulting but writing to stdout does nothing after the malloc anywhere in the program after that.

I also dont know if additional configuration in ubuntus side is needed to make such an idea work for example in the installation there was a part about proxies that at the moment i decided to ignorep  pFrom the few documents i have read about it since i was assigned this, a solution may lie in using nginx. The logic behind it if i am not mistaken and please correct me if i am is that nginx can help linking the HTTP requests through the port 80 which is normally opened for access in most machines and link it to a specific port on the machine The sexy app i have developped.p  pIn a more early stage, what ressources would i need to start this off Would i need a domain name IS it necessary Do i need a different virtual server to link the apps or can they be on the same machinep  pIf you have additional comments or tips for someone that is learning to do this kind of thing, please do.p

This is where I am having trouble, as I cant figure out how to search the redis cache by a field value.pli lipOnce the username and password can be accessed via the cache with the UUID, I will be inserting them into a Postgres DB. pli ol  pAny thoughts Or links to good redis documentationp  pAnother thought is, should I be using a hash rather than a set Cachers to the rescue pleasep

Negative 60676 pHad a debate with my colleague on this, as we had to deal with some asyncsync issues. However, it raised another question, which I couldnt figure out a definite answer for.p  pAssume a simple foreach loop .each, where foreach iteration I call a function set in the global scope. Does the function run synchronously or asynchronously Assume no Ajax, so what the function does is completely synchronous, albeit merely executed.

Negative 60676 pI am testing an application in which I declare a specific variable within my constructor and assign it to the return of a function imported from another class.br This is how my code looks likep  precodevar SomeClass  function Constructor     this.someClassHandler  null   Constructor.prototype.newSomeClass  function     SomeClass  require.SomeClass.js     return new SomeClass   Constructor.prototype.getFunction  function     this.someClassHandler  this.newSomeClass   Constructor.prototype.callSomeFunction  function     this.someClassHandler.someFunction  codepre  pWhen I now try to test my code whether the function someFunction from my imported class SomeClass was called within the methodcallSomeFunction I receive a failed test which responses that my variable someClassHandler still equals null which makes sense as I do not call the method getFunction that assigns this class to my variable. p  pI use mocha and sinon to do my tests, but I am a bit helpless whether to mock or stub this class in order to assign my variable this.someClassHandler correctly. p  pThe main purpose of my test regarding this issue should just be to check whether the function someFunction was called in the method callSomeFunction.p  pThis is a bit how it should look like, but obviously it does not make sense as it is now serves the purpose to understand what I intend to testp  precodevar myConstructor  new Constructor var mySomeClass  new SomeClass sinon.stubmyConstructor, newSomeClass.returnsmySomeClass var mySomeClassMock  sinon.mockmySomeClass  mySomeClassMock.expectssomeFunction.once myConstructor.callSomeFunction  mySomeClassMock.verify codepre  pI think it would be feasible to just call the method getFunction before I execute my callSomeFunction method, but it would be great to find another solution for this problem without calling this method.p  pAfter searching a while for a possible solution I am still unable to fix this problem so that it would be great to receive some help in order to fix this issue.p

Negative 60676 pThe code follows.p  precodestruct A    A    struct B    B    explicit operator A  return A    struct C    A a   CB b  ab   codepre  pI have a codestruct Acode which is not aggregate constructible because it has a constructor defined. The same goes for codestruct Bcode. But it also has an explicit userdefined conversion operator to codestruct Acode. Now codestruct Ccodes constructor takes a codestruct Bcode, and uses it to construct codestruct Acode. As on a hrefhttpen.cppreference.comwcpplanguagecastoperatorcppreferencea, the conversion operator can participate in direct initialization, which I believe is the case for the member initialization of codestruct Ccode. It passes on GCC 5.2 C11. But however it fails on Clang 3.6. I tried with C11, C14, and C1z.p  pIf I change codeabcode to codeabcode, it passes on both Clang and GCC.p  pI wonder if it is a Clang bug or I misunderstood the standardp

Negative 60676 pIve got a problem similar to the one described a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions3014089maintainsaverestorescrollpositionwhenreturningtoalistviewherea and a lot of the solutions on that page look like they work. The problem is, I dont know where Im supposed to put the code that they wrote. Ive tried putting it in the onCreate method and it doesnt work. The solution Im planning on using is setting a static number to a different int every time a different item is selected and then smoothscrolling to that position when the page is created.

Negative 60676 pWe are trying to automate a few things in CRM and I have an idea about how to go about it while still allowing customizations from the Process section in CRM Settings.p  pThe problem We receive a lot of Emails from an account that are added to a Queue. This queue fills up faster than we can clear it. Most of these Emails have a standard format and the user only has to read a few lines of the the Email body to figure out what to do. Theres a total of 6 different workflows that the user would do. These havent been implemented.p  pReading the documentation of CRM, I figured that I would need a custom Plugin that would parse the Email body, and trigger a workflow in CRM according to the values in the Email. I also need some of the values that the Email contains to be passed to the workflow. I already have the Plugin setup to do this.  p  pThe problem I run into is creating a process which takes in custom parameters passed over by the Plugin I created. I need to access these values in the frontend one of the Processes in CRM Settings. Is this possible If not, is there another way to achieve thisp
Negative 60676 pI thought I wanted to something fairly simple but it turns out its not simple.p  pI have a  with a child ltspangt element. I want to be able to set using javascriptjquery, the opacity of the ltdivgts background but not the text within it. The color of the div is userprovided and could be either a HEX value or a named color.p  pstrongIdea 1strong use rgba. This would be fine if I could only set the alpha but I cant. So I would need to check if the provided value is a hex or a named color and convert it to rgb values, which seems like way too much hassle for a simple problem.p  pstrongIdea 2strong prevent the span from inheriting the opacity value from its parent. But appearently the opacity isnt inherited. It is just applied on the whole DOM element and its children as if it were one element.p  pstrongIdea 3strong Create a seperate div just for the background color and make it a sibling of the span element. This would probably work but in my opinion is a ridiculous solution. Also when I tried that, I ran into a problems which forced me to apply css settings like codeposition absolutecode to my span and div. Which I didnt want to as it broke other styling I had applied. Maybe it is possible, but its such an ugly solution.p  pIs there really no other way to do thisp

Negative 60676 pI have a tableView on which I can add cells normally. Just so you understand, my tableView is populated by a core data on which I use fetch to get the items and add them to a mutable array, all the usual. After the fetch though, I call the reload method from tableview. But if I enter the cell to edit its content, when I get back to it, the tableview gets reordered automatically and I think thats because of the reload method, but if I dont call it, nothing shows up from the fetch. Here is my fetchp  precodeNSManagedObjectContext managedObjectContext  [self managedObjectContext] NSFetchRequest fetchRequest  [[NSFetchRequest alloc] initWithEntityNameEntity1] NSFetchRequest fetchRequest2  [[NSFetchRequest alloc] initWithEntityNameEntity2] self.titles  [[managedObjectContext executeFetchRequestfetchRequest errornil]mutableCopy] self.stitles  [[managedObjectContext executeFetchRequestfetchRequest2 errornil]mutableCopy]  [self.tableView reloadData] codepre  pAlso, it only reorders the second array, the one with the subtitles. Theres surely a way to stop this from happening or to reload the tableView somehow.p
