Positive 752 pI have an enabled CORS WCF Service and the other hand, I have a Rails app where Im trying to make a request via Ajax I manually ran this at Browser Debug Consolep  precodefunction GetBookId  .ajax    type GET,    url  httplocalhost8369BookService.svcBook3,    contentType json,    dataType json,    xhrFields        withCredentials false      ,    headers GET,    processData true,    success function data      var jsonData  JSON.stringifydata     var objData  .parseJSONjsonData     var bookId  objData.BookId     var isbn  objData.ISBN     ,     error function xhr          alertxhr.responseText           codepre  pThe WCF Service is running at port 8369, and my Rails app is at port 3000, so browsers complain about CrossDomain or CrossOrigin preflight requests with a Error 405.

Positive 752 pI would like to create an app that talks to the users computer so Id like to create a server with a REST API. What is the best way to go about doing this I looked into WCF but that seems overkill and most tutorials I see seems its more suitable to a server backend than being installed on a user computer. p  pAre there other more suitable frameworks in C that I can use to create a REST API on all user machines as opposed to using socketsp  pThanksp  pEdit Apologies for the lack of clarity. I would like to develop an app on iOS and Android that talks to the users machine. In order to do this, I need a server on the users machine that will perform the actions that I request from the mobile device. I want to avoid using sockets as a REST API will suffice and makes development easier. I believe WCF can achieve this but might be overkill for a simple app that talks to a users machine. Web API seeems like something that would be the solution but happy to hear if Im taking a wrong approach to this.p
Positive 752 pCould anyone point me in the right direction on how to manually sign the message body in WCF using a certificatep  pIm thinking implement IDispatchMessageInspector to intercept the message before reply is sent, sign it, craft the security header, add it to the message, and send it out.

Positive 752 pIm setting up my first web service using WCF in VB.NET, but have hit a problem.p  pIf I set the function up as a string and return a string, the service works fine  so Im guessing the service is registered OK.

When I return to the code above the javascript doesnt seem to think the GetMap service is even defined  so Im struggling to see why I thought it would return a serialised JSON object to the callback Javascript function  and despite searching for a couple of days now cant find a reason why  perhaps hopefully its really obvious.p

Positive 752 pI have a WCF service which provides an endpoint to dynamically generate a QRCode image. The image is first written to a memory stream codetempStreamcode. I then have the following code in the endpointp  precodeHttpResponse response  HttpContext.Current.Response response.Clear response.ClearContent response.ClearHeaders  response.Buffer  false response.ContentType  imagepng response.CacheControl  NoCache  response.AddHeaderContentLength, tempStream.Length.ToString response.AddHeaderAcceptRanges, bytes  tempStream.WriteToresponse.OutputStream  response.Flush response.End codepre  pIt works fine in Firefox. The image is downloaded if I hit the endpoint manually and it loads inline if I reference the endpoint as the codesrccode attribute in an codeimgcode tag. However, in IE, the image does not load inline in an codeimgcode tag, and if I try to hit the endpoint manually, it loads the full image the first time but any subsequent refreshes seemingly until the browser is restarted, it only loads part of the image.p  pUpon inspection of the network tab in the F12 window, it seems to be downloading exactly 1.00 KB of data including headers from the server, meaning it gets about 750 KB of image data. Then it makes another identical request to the server and gets only the headers back with no image data. The codeContentLengthcode header is set correctly to the size of the image IE just doesnt download that much. Again, Firefox is fine.p  pMy coworker recommended that I set codetransferModecode to codeStreamedcode in codeWeb.configcode, which I did, but that didnt work either. How can I get IE to download the entire image in one gop  pstrongEDITstrongp  pI should note that when running the WCF service in Visual Studios IIS Express server, Internet Explorer works fine. It is only when the application is deployed to IIS 7.5 that the problem occurs. Firefox works fine in both environments.p

Positive 752 pOkay, so, one of our web apps has a bidirectional net.tcp WCF service that it selfhosts and uses to communicate with another Windows service to do servicey things, and Im trying to add an HTTPSbased service to it to be consumed by something else, which Ive added using an MVC ServiceRoute, as belowp  precode            routes.Addnew ServiceRouteintegration,             new ServiceHostFactory,             typeofIntegrationService codepre  pAnd that works fine for communicating with emitem, but when the selfhosted TCP service starts up later in AppStart, I get thisp  precodeSystem.InvalidOperationException Could not find a base address that matches scheme net.tcp for the endpoint with binding NetTcpBinding. Registered base address schemes are []. codepre  pThe TCP service has base addresses defined in its configuration like sop  precode    ltservice nameName behaviorConfigurationServiceBehaviorgt   ltendpoint address contractContract bindingnetTcpBinding bindingConfigurationBindingConfigurationgt     ltidentitygt       ltdns valuelocalhost gt     ltidentitygt   ltendpointgt   lthostgt     ltbaseAddressesgt       ltadd baseAddressnet.tcplocalhost8700ImportServicegt     ltbaseAddressesgt   lthostgt ltservicegt codepre  p..and it works if you remove the ServiceRoute registration, which has me wondering if the whole request pipeline changes somehow when you do it. This seems odd as Id expect selfhosting to do its own thing completely separate from the hosting container ie IIS, but that doesnt seem to be the case once I register a ServiceRoute.p  pIm kind of at a loss. Im considering dropping HTTPS and going making this new service TCPbased with some SslStream mixed in, but since the application is hosted in IIS, that would lose some benefits like easy SSL setup and automatic activation when requests come in, and I cant remove the existing TCP service emyetem because the current programming model requires it to be bidirectional although were looking at phasing that out in the future, at which point converting it would be an option.p  pSuggestionsthoughtsquestionsp

So, is it an optimal way in terms of performance and readability to do this codeInnerList  items as ListltTgt  items.ToListcode If no, please provide with details about better way and why.p

If I implement the exact same WCF client specific code in a WPF desktop application, no exception will be thrown. I can confirm that the service works fine, and the windows phone application works fine as well as long as I remove the Thread.Sleep61000. In my realworld production scenario which this simplified example reflects, the client has to be able to wait for longer than one minute without throwing a CommunicationException. Since the example works if I do the same thing from a WPF application, Im suspecious that the problem relates to a limitation on the Windows Phone platform. But I cant find any information that states that WCF calls cant take any longer than one minute on Windows Phone.p  pFurthermore Ive tried setting the OperationTimeout on the client proxy like sop  precodeclient.InnerChannel.OperationTimeout  TimeSpan.FromMinutes5.0 codepre  pBut with no luck. Any suggestions are welcome.p

Positive 752 pWe are executing powershell scripts for exchange online using c. We created WCF services for executing different commands and calling that services.

Whenever I executes the commands, I send ConnectionInformation object to runspace.

We want to maintain the different sessions for different users.

Positive 752 pI have a WebAPI2 REST service that returns all test entities using testentities at the end of the url. A client consuming this web service reported that they were able to consume this method in Postman without issue.  However, when they called this service method from their app, they received the following errorp  pXmlHttpRequest cannot load testentites.  The request was redirected to  testentites, which is disallowed for crossorigin requests that require  preflight.p  pThe client later reported that they were able to get around the error above by simply calling the service method with a trailing  on the end but the standard format to get all entities from a rest service method doesnt use the trailing slash.p  pAny idea what the issue might be in the client app that would cause the app to require putting a trailing  at the end of the rest service method  Or is this a common requirement when calling rest service methods from certain types of applicationsp

Negative 752 pHello again ladies and gentsp  pOK, following on from my other question on a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions6681aspnetwebserviceresultsproxyclassesandtypeconversion relnofollowASP.NET Web Service Results, Proxy Classes and Type Conversiona. Ive come to a part in my project where I need to get my thinking cap on.p  pBasically, we have a large, complex custom object that needs to be returned from a Web Service and consumed in the client application.p  pNow, based on the previous discussion, we know this is going to then take the form of the proxy classes as the return type. To overcome this, we need to basically copy the properties from one to the other.p  pIn this case, that is something that I would really, really, emreallyem like to avoidp  pSo, it got me thinking, stronghow else could we do thisstrongp  pMy current thoughts are to enable the object for complete serialization to XML and then return the XML as a string from the Web Service. We then deserialize at the client. This will mean a fair bit of attribute decorating, but at least the code at both endpoints will be light, namely by just using the .NET XML Serializer.p  h2What are your thoughts on thish2

Negative 752 pHi everybody on stackoverflow.p  h1SHORT VERSION h1  pI need to use x,y,z acceleration values related only to the movement of the iPhone. Just to be clear, think an environment like a car. The iPhones accelerometer is very sensitive. If I log acceleration values with a frequency of 100Hz, there are so many values related to noise, car vibrations and other acceleration vectors which are not directed like the iPhone motion for example, dampers oscillations cause acceleration vectors directed along zaxis.p  pIn other words, I need to filter accelerations detection in a way capable to isolate accelerations whose direction is the same within a certain offset of the motion direction.p  h1DEEPER CONSIDERATIONS h1  pObviously, I could fix the iphone position so that its y axis overlaps the movement direction in the previous car environment, this means fixing the iphone y axis parallel to the front direction. The problem is that I need to allow iphones relative moments. I cant fix the iphone position.p  pFirst of all I analyzed values produced by noise and oscillations, and I figured out that their magnitude is often very higher than normal car accelerations. Filtering the magnitude is a good idea to ease the problem but its not a solution on one side many unwanted noise accelerations are not filtered because their magnitude falls within the range, on the other side many wanted motion accelerations are filtered because they falls outside the range.p  pOn the iPhone 3GS I can use the magnetometer to measure degrees heading relative to magnetic North. I could use this to find the direction of motion but the problem is still there  magneticHeading value is always measured relative to the top of the device. So the iPhone should be fixed along the front direction.p  pI cant think any other solution. Ideas Tank youp

Negative 752 pI am using Sarp Architecture on a project, which comes with the [Transaction] attribute for Controller methods.

Basically I want to award all of my registered and active users with bids which are stored in another table.p  pSo for the Table users I have ran this queryp  precodeSELECT     FROM users  WHERE active  1    AND admin  0  ORDER BY users.id ASC codepre  pWhich will show all active users who are not administrators.p  pNow I would like to give each one of these users which are identified by the ID field in another table.p  pSo in the bids table I would need to add a new row for each one of those users with all of the same values except for the userid field which will basically match the id field of the table usersp  pWhat would be the best approach for this.

Negative 752 pI am trying to write an app that requires the LED flash to go into torch mode.  The problem is, Android 2.1 does not support this mode and therefore I cannot support the platform yet.  Wouldnt be an issue, but I am writing it for my fiance and her Epic 4G only has 2.1 right now.  I found some code samples that use some undocumented API calls and therefore work on the Motorola Droid and such, but they do not work on the Epic.  Does anyone have some suggestions on where to look to find code that should help me get this workingp

Negative 752 pI have to create thousands of individual EPS Encapsulated PostScript files. These files will be printed by a company that uses a Roland printer and software. The printer software only accepts eps files.p  pSo this is the procedure Ive implemented using a custom vector graphics libraryp  ol liCreate an individual bitmap this worksli liDraw a rectangle around the bitmap in a certain named color the color must be named CutContour YMCK 0, 0.9, 0, 0. The color itself isnt important, but the name must be set to CutContour.li liSave the graphics in the EPS formatli ol  pNow, using some custom library I was able to do all the steps Ive described, but the library apparently doesnt support color names spot colors.p  pAnother strategy I tried in my desperation Ive created a working example file in EPS using CorelDraw I even did it with Adobe Illustrator.p  pUsing a hex editor I extracted the first part of the file until the bitmap information and the bottom part after the bitmap. Using both parts I was able to inject the individual bitmap and created new Frankenstein eps files just by concatenating the parts.p  pI could open these files in CorelDraw, but they must be somehow corrupt, because the company that prints the images cant open them on their machines. Also, I have some other issues with that files.

Negative 752 pIm just going through the jQuery API and Im a bit confused on codemapcode amp codegetcode method.  I know Im wrong but the codemapcode method looks a lot like an code.eachcode statement  Except the documentation says it returns a new jQuery object.  p  pIve been playing with this on jsfiddle trying to get my head around it, but Im not quite there.  a hrefhttpjsfiddle.netBnP45 relnofollowherea is the jsfiddle link p  pAlso here is the snippet of codep  precode.fn.equalizeHeights  function      var two  this.mapfunctioni, e                                  return e.height                                  console.logtwo     console.logtwo.constructor     console.logtwo.get     console.logtwo.get.constructor     return this.heightMath.max.applythis,two.get  input.clickfunction      div.equalizeHeights  codepre  pI see they are extending jQuery using prototype to create a function called codeequalizeHeightscode.  And codethiscode represents the selector for all the div elements on the page.  The codemapcode call iterates through each of the items in the array of divs and returns its height  But what Im confused about is what Im logging to the console.  One is an codeobjectcode and the other is an codearraycode  p  pCould someone elaborate on what codemapcode and codegetcode are doing in this snippet of code  p  pThanks in advance.p

Negative 752 pOk for sure this has been asked and answered already but i somehow cant find a proper tutorial. I want to keep the text displayed to users somewhere else and to prevent my code from becoming too large and unreadable. My site wont be internationalized. I just want to have some kind of file with keyvalue structure and get the text from there. I want to keep the text in files, not in the database as some tutorials suggest. I found a solution which will work but i am not sure whether this is a good approach. I am thinking of using parseinifile and to keep my texts in .ini file. Is there something wrong with this approach Could you suggest something betterp

The xyz.rb is the arbitrary database name I have listed under the test section in database.yml. I have already raked the database.p  pIm pretty sure my problem has to do with how Im not going with the sqlite3 in the tutorial but instead with mysql2. The resources I have managed to find only give guidance on what to input for the development section in database.yml, but not for the rest of the sections like test. So, my question is, what exactly does this error mean, how to fix it, and how should I configure my database.yml file I tried entering a file I see in my db folder like schema.rb, but this renders the same error.p  pThank you very much for your help.p

Libqxt wont compile on windows with ssh, even after following the steps described a hrefhttpwww.qtcentre.orgarchiveindex.phpt39012.htmlherea and a hrefhttpdev.libqxt.orglibqxtissue114unabletobuildqxtsshonwin32msvc2005herea.  Libsshs C wrapper class includes everything in the header, which is causing linking failures if not carefully shepherded.  Once those linker issues are solved, Libsshs compiled library crashes CDB, so debugging with libssh becomes impossible, regardless of whether or not the c wrapper is used.  So now Im back to libssh2 or paying for it via some dubious program that has apparently not been updated in four years.  a hrefhttpwww.cs.auckland.ac.nzpgut001cryptlibCryptliba, maybe  It doesnt help that most of the qt forum help seems to be spawn another process, which therefore requires my users to have ssh installed, which is definitely not par for the course on Windows.p
Negative 752 pIve inherited a project that has used contract first with Thinktectures WSCF.blue, so Ive got XSDs and WSDLs to work with.p  pNew requirement is to add support for large files via streaming.  Other than byte arrays which can be defined in XML as base64binary but I thought this was only appropriate for chunked transfer, is there a way to define a stream in the XSD so I can then follow the contract first approachp
Negative 752 pIm trying to understand IO.popen when its command is codecode which starts a new Ruby interpreter.p  pThere is not much material about this subject, and Im getting slowly through them, mainly because of me as I only code for fun.p  pAs far as I have understood when codeIO.popen, w f ...code is invoked  thats with a block   that block will be run by embothem the parent and the child process. The difference is that the parent process will get an IO object as a result, but the child gets only a Nil. Thats easy, I need to check codefcode in the block and when it is Nil, execution is in the child process, when it is not nil, execution is in the parent. So I have to write both code for parent and child separated by codeifcode. p  pThis time it helps me to understand the problem, that emthe block is part of the IO.popen commandem.p  pI have this codep  precodepipe  IO.popen,w  puts This line will break functionality if uncommented   if pipe  nil then     pipe.puts PID Process.pid     stderr.puts Parent from child pipe.gets.chomp   else     stderr.puts Child PID Process.pid and Parent gets.chomp     puts Mkay   end codepre  h2Questionsh2  ul liWhat decides which process runs first If they were to append a file would it be vulnerable to race conditionli liWhy the 2nd line breaks the code The codepipe  IO.popen...code command shouldnt be related to the codeif..else..endcode block, yet they are. For me codepipecode is a file handle like in old Turbo Pascal which is first definded somewhere, then manipulated elsewhere.li ul

Negative 752 pThe problem is pretty complicated to explain but here goes p  pIm making a paint program that draws paths onto a canvas with textured background. Each stroke is stored as a path that updates as the user moves the stylus across the screen. When the path is updated I call drawpath on the canvas. The problem is that on each move event, the path is drawn over the existing line on the canvas, so the antialiasing on it darkens the existing line and make it appear thicker and jaggier than expected.p  pI had a solution where I store the older canvas the one without the active path and keep another transparent canvas on top of that. I would clear the top canvas and redraw the path on each move event, and then draw both canvases together. BUT that makes the program so slow that the paths look terrible  you can tell the drawing is lagging way behind the stylus movements.p  pIs there any way to make either A drawing  clearing multiple canvases faster  or B make antialiasing not mess up on multiple redrawsp

Negative 752 pSuppose I have two projects. One is an application and the other is a shared library that contains common, reusable code that could be used by more than just this application.p  pMy application uses STL, and my shared library also uses STL. The first problem here is that my shared library is using STL. If I ever build a newer version of STL into my application but I do not rebuild my shared library because it is not necessary, then we will have compatibility issues right away.p  pMy first thought to solve this issue is to not use STL at all in the interface to the shared library classes. Suppose we have a function in my library that takes a string and does something with it. I would make the function prototype look likep  precodevoid DoStuffWithStrings char const str  codepre  pinstead ofp  precodevoid DoStuffWithStrings stdstring constamp str  codepre  pFor strings this will probably be OK between different versions of STL, but the downside is that we are going from codestdstringcode, to codecharcode, and back to codestdstringcode, which seems like it causes performance issues.p  pIs the boxingunboxing of raw types to their STL counterparts recommended This becomes even worse when we try to do this to a codestdlistcode, since there really is no raw type I am aware of that we could easily pass it as without doing some sort of On or similar operation.p  pWhat designs work best in this scenario What are the proscons of eachp

Negative 752 pIm starting to use TinyMCE in an existing project. Unfortunately the project uses a stylesheet which declares  CSS rules for selector codecontent tdcode, which was a bad decision by the designer. Theses rules are breaking the TinyMCE theme. However, the rules are applied very often in the project. Therefore, replacing them would be too much effort.p  pThe codecontent tdcode rules have higher priority because they are loaded before TinyMCE loads its CSS rules from javascript. If I was able to load TinyMCE CSS by using a codeltlinkgtcode tag, I could solve the problem by loading the TinyMCE stylesheet before the projects stylesheet.p  ul liIs the assumption correctli liIs there a way to manually load tinyMCE stylesheets via linktagli liDo you have any other ideasli ul
Negative 752 pThis question popped into my head today at work when I was having yet another domestic affair with my compiler.  Despite my buff pinky due to all the semicolon pressing I do at work, I managed to miss one before an codeifcode statement.  Obviously, this resulted in a compile errorp  blockquote   perror C2143 syntax error  missing  before ifp blockquote  pSo I wondered well gee, why cant you tell me the line thats missing the semicolon instead of the line emafterem the problem. and I proceeded to experiment with other similar syntax errorsp  blockquote   perror C2065 myUndeclared  undeclared identifierp      perror C2143 syntax error  missing  before ifp      petc...p blockquote  pNow, all of those errors would, similarly, take me to the line emafterem the problem and complain about something before the codeifcode statement.p  pConsider the followingp  pre classlangc prettyprintoverridecodeSomeFunctionx Notice, there is no  here  ifbSomeCondition      ...  codepre  pI get two compile errorsp  blockquote   pLine 265 error C2065 x  undeclared identifierp      pLine 266 error C2143 syntax error  missing  before ifp blockquote  pHowever, the first error correctly tells me the line number, despite the missing semicolon.  This suggests to me that the compiler doesnt get tripped up in parsing and is able to make it past the semicolon problem.  So, why is it that the compiler insists on grammatical errors being reported in this way   Other errors non grammatical are reported on the lines they are found.  Does this have to do with the compiler making multiple passes  Basically, I hope someone with a working knowledge of the C compiler might explain specifically what the compiler is doing that necessitates the reporting of errors in this before way.p
Negative 752 pI have an application that serves artifacts from files pages from PDF files as images, the original PDF files live on S3 and they are downloaded to the servers that generate the images when a client hits one of them. These machines have a local caching mechanism that guarantees that each PDF file is downloaded only once.p  pSo, when a client comes with a request stronggive me page 1 of pdf 123.pdfstrong this cache is checked, if there is no pdf file in there, its downloaded from S3 and stored at the local cache and then a process generates this page 1 and sends the image back to the client.p  pThe client itself does not know its connected to a special server, it all looks like its just accessing the website server, but, for the sake of performance I would like to make sure this client is always going to be directed to the same file server that served its first request and downloaded the file from S3.p  pI could just set a cookie on the client to get him to always download from that specific file server, but placing this on the client leads to unfair usage, as some users are going to open many documents and some are not so I would like to perform this load balancing at the resource level PDF document.p  pEach document has a unique identification integer primary key in the database and my first solution was using Redis and storing the document id as a key and the value is the host of the server machine that currently has this document cached, but I would like to remove Redis or look for a simpler way to implement this that would not require looking for keys somewhere else.p  pAlso, it would be nice if the defined algorithm or idea would allow for adding more file servers on the fly.p  pWhat would be the best way to perform this kind of load balancing with affinity based on resourcesp  pJust for the sake of saying, this app is a mix of Ruby, java and Scala.p

Negative 752 pI can stream video RTMP just fine in JW Player by LongTail Media. The Pause seems to work, however using Windows 7s Resource Monitor I can see that the player continues to download data when the video is paused, it downloads for about 60 seconds and does not seem to be longer for longer videos. I have found the same using the examples on longtailmedias website, so I know it is not something I have done.p  pI want a way to pause the video and have it stop downloading, this will save us lots of bandwidth. But also have it continue where it left off if play is pressed again.p  pI checked the logs on our wowza media server, which indicates that the player actually waits 60s before it sends the pause command to the server.p  pLongTails support say that the pause functionality uses the built in NetStream class and its behaviour is out of their control.p  pI have tested flowplayer online examples, and a couple of Adobe  OSMF examples and they all continue to download for 60 seconds after the video is paused.p  pA way to get this working in JW player would be best, but Are there emanyem flash players that will stop downloading while paused p  pIf this is not possible with RTMP are there any technologies that will do this with a flash playerp  pthanks p

Negative 752 pThere is a peculiarity that I encountered while using Java scheduled executors and was wondering if what I experienced is normal.p  pI need to schedule tasks that execute at a predefined rate of 5 seconds. It is expected that these tasks will take longer than 5 seconds to execute from time to time, but when the time to run them goes below 5 seconds, the backed up list of tasks should run in quick succession to catch up. When running the tasks, it is important to know what the original scheduled execution time was think codescheduledExecutionTimecode in codejava.util.TimerTaskcode. Finally, I need to track the difference between scheduled time and actual time to identify when the schedule is drifting and by how much.p  pSo far I have implemented all of this by using Java executors, and the following class illustrates the general ideap  precodepublic class ExecutorTest      public static final long PERIOD  5000      public static void mainString[] args          Executors.newSingleThreadScheduledExecutor.scheduleAtFixedRate                 new Command, 0, PERIOD, TimeUnit.MILLISECONDS           private static final class Command implements Runnable          long timestamp  0          public void run              long now  System.currentTimeMillis              if timestamp  0                  timestamp  now                            Drift is the difference between scheduled time and execution time             long drift  now  timestamp              String format  Ran at 1tF lttT,lttL drift 2dms             System.out.printlnString.formatformat, now, drift              timestamp  PERIOD                codepre  pRunning the code listed above shows that the drift which ideally should be as close to 0 as possible fluctuates by as much as a few seconds, the result of which is that tasks as executed either prematurely or late. I have created a graph from the results of running this for about 150 minutesp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comVrfGS.png altJava executor driftp  pSo my first question is whether this is normal. My environment consists of 32 bit Windows XP and Java 1.5 update 21 although Java 6 update 22 produces similar results.p  pThe second question is whether there is a simple way to reduce the amount of drift. If I use a simple codejava.util.Timercode or even just codeThread.sleepcode, the drift is nonexistent.p  pLastly, is there a better way of tracking the scheduled execution time when using scheduled executorsp

Negative 752 pI was wondering how I would go about doing this, as Ive tried a myriad of different user32 functions and researched online quite extensively, but unfortunately I havent been able to come up with a solution yet.p  pThere is an application that has 5 threads.

Negative 752 pI have a django database application, which is constantly evolving. p  pWe want to track the progress of samples as they progress from p  precodesample gt  library gt machine gt statistics, etc.  codepre  pGenerally it is a one to many relationship from each stage left to right. p  pHere is a simplified version of my database schema p  precodetable sample id     name    table library  id      name  sampleid  foreign key to sample table   table machine  id name status libraryid  foreign key to library table  table sampletoprojects  sampleid projectid  table librarytosubprojects libraryid  subprojectid codepre  pSo far it has been going ok, except now, everything needs to be viewed by projects. Each of the stages can belong to one or more projects. I have added a manytomany relation between project and the existing tables. p  pI am trying to create some views that do the multiple left joins and show the progress of samples for a project. p  precodesample A sample B   library1    machine1    sample B   library2    machine2 sample C   library3 codepre  pfirst try at the query was like this p  precodeSELECT fields FROM sampletoprojects ,  sample  LEFT JOIN library ON sample.id  library.sampleid ,  librarytoproject  LEFT JOIN machine ON machine.libraryid  library.id WHERE      sampletoproject.projectid  30      AND sampletoproject.sampleid  sample.id     AND librarytoproject.projectid  30     AND librarytoproject.libraryid  libraryid codepre  pThe problem here is that the LEFT JOIN is done before the WHERE clause. p  pSo if we have a sample that belongs to projectA and projectB.  If the sample has a library for projectB, but we want to filter on projectA, the LEFT JOIN does not add a row with NULLs for library columns as there are libraries. However these rows get filtered back out by the WHERE clause, and the sample does not show up. p  precodereults filtering on projectA  sample1projectA, projectB   libraryA projectA sample1projectA, projectB   libraryB projectA, projectB sample2projectA, projectB   libraryC projectB  this row gets filtered out, it should show only the sample details codepre  pSo my solution is to create a subquery to join the other right hand side tables before the LEFT JOIN is done. p  precodeSELECT fields FROM      sampletoprojects ,       sample       LEFT JOIN            SELECT library.id as libid , library.sampleid as smapleid ,  library.name as libname , machinename            FROM library ,            libtoprojects ,             machine                      AS jointable ON sample.id  jointable.sampleid       WHERE           sampletoproject.projectid  30           AND sampletoproject.sampleid  sample.id codepre  pThe problem is that there are a few more stages in the real version of my database, so I will need to do a nested subquery for each LEFT JOIN. The SQL will be getting pretty large ad difficult to read, and I wondered if there is a better solution at the design level Also it wont play nicely with Django models though if I can get the SQL working I will be happy enough. p  pOr can anyone suggest some sort of best practices for this type of problem I am sure it must be relatively common with showing users in groups or something similar. If anyone knows a way that would fit well with django models that would be even better.  p

Negative 752 pIm trying to figure out the best way to design Car and Road objects for a game design Im working on.p  pThe idea is for AI Cars as well as the Player controlled car to recognize when they traverse dotted lines or straight lines on the Roads. Id like to be able to build a Variable Lane Road for Unity3D with the appropriate flags and sub objects so that the Cars recognize where they are and when and how they traverse or take turns etc etcp  pFor example, a Road can have a single direction or be in both directions. For each direction there can be a number of lanes. Lanes allow cars to overtake each other meaning a dotted line between the lanes. If its a bi directional road, then theres a line between the two lanes  optionally and ideally, if theres more than one lane on any of the directions, then the line that separates the directional lanes is straight. By default, there should be a flag that draws the line according to an isOvertakingAllowed boolean flag.p  pThe most important part is that the Car objects need to know what lane they are on or if they are on a lane separating line, and what type this separation is overtaking allowed or not. Thats the hard part, to me.p  pAny help is appreciated.p

Negative 752 pSo I was doing a development project for my work and basically the idea is that we have a Excel VBA macro that needs to do some parsing of files, create a new file and send the file location to a Unix script running on the mainframe.p  pThe location of the file is different every time you run the macro and thanks to Samba, I can create the file in Windows and it is immediately accessible to the Unix system.p  pNow the problem arises how can I pass in the location of the file. The issue is a program called plink which is a version of putty that allows configuration file to sit alongside the program itself rather than in the registry of PC is the only approved option to do this work I know Cgywin would do this quite easily and the program sits on a network drive with multiple people would probably need to run it concurrently. The authorizedkeys file has a exec to point to the Unix script that needs to run and for security reasons, I can not change that. However I can write a script in Unix to take the unnamed parameter and use it to run the script that only takes the parameter file location as a named parameter filedirectorydatafile.p  pI tried to run that script with in cmd plink.exe serverIP directorydatafile the login is already configured but apparently the parameter could not get passed in this way.p  pI have also tried plink.exe serverIP directorydatafile and there is no luck there as well.p  pI am just wondering if there is a short and neat way to get this done. We had a sample project with the similar configuration but the script to do this took like 10000 lines which I dont want to read, I sort of believes this should be done in like a short script with 10 or 20 lines. I am free to create whatever Windows script if I need to, provided that I could run multiple sessions of the program with different parameters concurrently.p

Negative 752 pIn the past, with Eclipse and a PHP Serversystem, I had it setup so that when I commited changes to the CVS repository, it also saved the actual php files on the server.

So  the cvs is in a folder stucture like varcvs and my system filesPHP files facing clients are in something like varwwwhtml.  How would one go about setting something like this up I use sftp to change files right now with Filezilla.  It was very convenient before being able to commit the changes and check the web to make sure that changes worked.  Right now I have to commit the changes then save the file with ftp to see the changes.  Would love to be able to get rid of the sftp with Filezilla step if at all possible...p
Negative 752 pI have a client who insists on crisp images on his Web pages. One image he gave me was 2592 pixels wide, but the page is only 940 pixels wide. No problem, I just resize the images using Photoshop but there is a noticeable drop in quality, lots of jagged edges. I expect a loss of quality when resizing to onethird the size, but I thought I could do better. So what I did is take the original image and have the browser Chrome resize it to 940 pixels wide. Yes, I understand this is the absolute worst thing to do but I was just experimenting. It turns out the browser does a much better job of resizing than Photoshop  I dont get the jagged edges and the picture looks fairly close to the original in quality. p  pSo whats the deal here Why is Photoshop not as good as resizing as Chrome IE8 and Firefox do just as good a job too Ive tried tweaking Photoshops resampling options but have seen no real difference. p

Negative 752 pFolks, please be gentle, I am not a professional programmer, just a site admin and I need some help. Here is my problemp  pI am running a web site, with php. I would like to show pictures to my members, but I would like those pictures to remain within specific size limits, so they do not cause the visitors to scroll horizontally in order to view the whole picture. So far, I have limited the size of uploaded pictures to 800x600 as a least common denominator. However, I believe that users with larger monitors should be allowed to see larger pictures, so I plan to remove that 800x600 limit, but I still would like to make sure that the image displayed wouldnt be larger than the visitor viewport actually lets say 23s of the viewport.p  pNow, I understand that php runs on the server and javascript runs on the client and that there is no easy way to pass the viewport dimensions to the php code, I tried and failed miserably, so that is clear.p  pBut Ive also read especially in this site that there are ways to do it, using JQuery andor Ajax. My main problem I do not know how to program in Javascript, JQuery or Ajax. So my question is What exactly should I include in my php file to cause the client to return the browser width to the php file or my html template, in order to use the browser width in the  statement my program generates p  pIf I understand this right, when a visitor asks to see a page and my server send them the result of my page, there should be some code, which will send me back the browser width, then the server will resend the page, using the value it received. Am I correct in that If thats the way it works, it would be ideal if I could get that browser width value and store it in a php global variable, so that not every page is generated twice. Can that be done p  pPlease be very specific, as I said, I am a newbie on these things.p  pNeedless to say, any help would be greatly appreciated.p  pMany thanks for your attention.p  pP.S. I have already download and installed JQuery in my server, but I have no idea how to use it for this problem.p

Negative 752 pIm currently using Telerik Open Access which is hateful, but that said is there not an architectural issue around the use of LINQ and ORMs in generalp  pIt occurs to me that what we are doing is moving the burden of data manipulation from the DBMS which is optimised to  perform that task to in my case a webserver which is not.p  pAlso, at least in Teleriks case we are restricting the flexibility of our coding model. In this project I have to extract and create complex data structures that do not map directly into a CRUD interface.  In Telerik Open Access at least, if I use a stored procedure to create the data and it does not map into a known entity I have to return the data as an object array.p  pSo instead I use the entities created by the ORM and manipulate them using LINQ.  The resulting code is ridiculously complex compared to the relatively simple equivalent SQL statement.p  pId be interested in your views specifically around the advocacy of using an ORM and LINQ and whether this is architecturally unsound.p  pIt certainly feels it to me.p  pI havent included code samples because the actual code is irrelevant. That said it might be instructive to know that a 10 line TSQL query 6 of those lines are joins has turned into 300 lines including whitespace of LINQ statements to do the same thing.p

Negative 752 pI am working on a .NET application for processing geographic data that uses ESRIs ArcObjects COM library via ESRIs own .NET interop assemblies.p  pWhen running in production, the process can crash during some operations due to reaching the 2GB perprocess memory limit. ArcObjects is a 32bit library. This is because some of the processing steps can create many temporary ArcObjects geometry objects. It will leak memory and eventually run out of memory despite manually releasing these objects using a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibrarysystem.runtime.interopservices.marshal.finalreleasecomobject.aspx relnofollowcodeFinalReleaseComObjectcodea and associated helper methods. However, I can force the GC to release the memory by calling a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibrarysystem.gc.waitforpendingfinalizers.aspx relnofollowcodeWaitForPendingFinalizerscodea, and calling it regularly along with codeGC.Collectcode and codeFinalReleaseComObjectcode keeps the memory usage under control. Otherwise, many objects remain in memory until the process exits normally or abnormally.p  pstrongFirst questionstrong why isnt the memory held by the ArcObjects COM objects released immediately Or, why does the GC allow the process to crash instead of finalizing the released COM objects and reclaiming the memory before it crashesp  pThe application runs in production on Windows 2008 64bit, while I develop using Windows 7 32bit. I can get the process to crash on the production boxes, but not on my development box. I thought that this may have been because locally I usually run in Visual Studio with a Debug build, but I have also tried it without the debugger Start Without Debugging using a Release build but even then it didnt use anywhere near as much memory as in production and wont crash.p  pstrongSecond questionstrong Whyp  pEDIT In my previous experiments, I worked out that codeGC.Collectcode by itself is not sufficient, even though I was calling it explicitly. I have a utility method that calls codeGC.Collectcode followed by codeGC.WaitForPendingFinalizerscode and calling it after every algorithm iteration keeps memory usage down.p

Negative 752 pWe are working on a website which will feature about 5 different user roles, each with different properties. In the current version of the database schema we have a single emusersem table which holds all the users, and all of their properties.p  pThe problem is that the properties that we need differ per user role. All users have the same basis properties, like a name, email address and password. But on top of that the properties differ per role. Some have social media links, others have invoice addresses, etc. In total there may be up to 60 columns properties, of which only a portion are used by each user role.p  pIn total we may have about 250,000 users in the table, of which the biggest portion about 220,000 will be of a single user role and use about 20 of the 60 columns.

A way to prevent this is by using VIEWs, but Ive read some outdated articles that VIEWs may hurt performance, like a hrefhttpwww.mysqlperformanceblog.com20070812mysqlviewasperformancetroublemaker relnofollowhttpwww.mysqlperformanceblog.com20070812mysqlviewasperformancetroublemakera.p  pDoes the perfect structure even exist Any suggestion, or isnt this really a problem at all and should we just put all users in a single big tablesp

Negative 752 pIve built a DLL that gets injected into a console application usually via SetWindowHookEx. Its important for the DLL to output information to the console which I have been doing with stdcout.

Negative 752 pI have an MFC application using MDI, something similar to the MFC Scribble exampletutorial.  When the child window is maximized, the captiontitle of the main frame window is automatically adjusted so that the title of the child window is appended, like Scribble  [Scribb1].  When the title of the child window is very long, it is truncated.  The length of whole caption seems to be limited to about 160 characters.  Is there a way to increase this limit and show more characters  I guess overriding WMNCPAINT to redraw the caption is one way, but prefer other simple solution if there is one.  Ive tried overriding OnUpdateFrameTitle and it doesnt seem to work for the whole combined caption.p

Before I bite off that chunk Im just trying to get test going with a custom image class which will hold a little bit of extra info on top of the codepictureboxcode object.  The issue Im having is that my object codeoSlideItemcode as codeclsSlideItemcode which inherits the codepictureboxcode doesnt seem to load a picture at run time.  Ive tried two different methods which are mentioned in help and on this forum and I cant seem to get a picture at run time.  I havent found anything that mentions my specific situation which is inheriting the codepictureboxcode.p  pI tried setting the image location and size properties before loading the picture, didnt change anything.p  pAre there some extra steps I need to do in order to initiate the picturebox image since I am using the functionality in an inherited state instead of a native picturebox object p  pI am also putting these image holding objects into a collection as you can see.

Negative 752 pIn my application, in one of the pages I have several data ouput and data iteration components. This page contains several popup model panels as well. Every component is created with their unique IDs. The page contains several independent forms to submit the components. The mentioned page is my main page in the application. When I enter the page, it redirects me to the main page as mentioned. Initially when I enter the page, it works properly. However, when I walk through other pages and come back to the main page I encounter the duplicate Id for a component error. I tried to solve this problem by googling and reading other forms but I couldnt obtain a clear answer. How could I solve it, what criteria should I consider throughly. Any help would greatly be appreciated. Thank you in deep...p

Negative 752 pI am new to opencv and trying to implement image matching between two images. For this purpose, Im trying to understand the difference between feature descriptors, descriptor extractors and descriptor matchers. I came across a lot of terms and tried to read about them on the opencv documentation website but I just cant seem to wrap my head around the concepts. I understood the basic difference here. a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions6832933differencebetweenfeaturedetectionanddescriptorextractionrq1Difference between Feature Detection and Descriptor Extractionap  pBut I came across the following terms while studying on the topic  p  blockquote   pFAST, GFTT, SIFT, SURF, MSER, STAR, ORB, BRISK, FREAK, BRIEF p blockquote  pI understand how FAST, SIFT, SURF work but cant seem to figure out which ones of the above are only detectors and which are extractors.p  pThen there are the matchers. p  blockquote   pFlannBased, BruteForce, knnMatch and probably some others.p blockquote  pAfter some reading, I figured that certain matchers can only be used with certain extractors as explained here. a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions7232651howdoesopencvorbfeaturedetectorworkHow Does OpenCV ORB Feature Detector Worka The classification given is quite clear but its only for a few extractors and I dont understand the difference between float and uchar. p  pSo basically, can someone please p  ol liclassify the types of detectors, extractors and matchers based on float and uchar, as mentioned, or some other type of classificationli liexplain the difference between the float and uchar classification or whichever classification is being usedli limention how to initialize code various types of detectors, extractors and matchersli ol  pI know its asking for a lot but Ill be highly grateful.

Negative 752 pI heard about non accuracy of float FFT, especially of cos and sin function  there are totally different numbers compared with double.p  pI ask because I rewrite some code  CooleyTukey FFT algorithm and the results are different.

Negative 752 pIm running into a strange issue or intended where codecombinefirstcode or codeupdatecode are causing values stored as codeboolcode to be upcasted into codefloat64codes if the argument supplied is not supplying the boolean columns.p  pExample workflow in ipythonp  precodeIn [144] test  pd.DataFrame[[1,2,False,True],[4,5,True,False]], columns[a,b,isBool, isBool2]  In [145] test Out[145]    a  b isBool isBool2 0  1  2  False    True 1  4  5   True   False   In [147] b  pd.DataFrame[[45,45]], index[0], columns[a,b]  In [148] b Out[148]     a   b 0  45  45  In [149] test.updateb  In [150] test Out[150]     a   b  isBool  isBool2 0  45  45       0        1 1   4   5       1        0 codepre  pWas this meant to be the behavior of the codeupdatecode function I would think that if nothing was specified that codeupdatecode wouldnt mess with the other columns.p  hr  pstrongEDITstrong I started tinkering around a little more. The plot thickens. If I insert one more command codetest.update[]code before running codetest.updatebcode, boolean behavior works at the cost of numbers upcasted as codeobjectscode. This also applies to DSMs simplified example.p  pBased on a hrefhttpsgithub.compydatapandasblobmasterpandascoreframe.pyL3830 relnofollowpandas source codea, it looks like the reindexlike method is creating a DataFrame of dtype codeobjectcode, while reindexlike codebcode creates a DataFrame of dtype codefloat64code. Since codeobjectcode is more general, subsequent operations work with bools. Unfortunately running codenp.logcode on the numerical columns will fail with an codeAttributeErrorcode. p

Negative 752 pIm building off of a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions14613584canaclienteverreliablygenerateapkforanobjectbeingwrittentoadba previous discussion I had with Jon Skeeta.p  pThe gist of my scenario is as followsp  ul liClient application has the ability to create new PlaylistItem objects which need to be persisted in a database.li liUse case requires the PlaylistItem to be created in such a way that the client does not have to wait on a response from the server before displaying the PlaylistItem.li liClient generates a UUID for PlaylistItem, shows the PlaylistItem in the client and then issue a save command to the server.li ul  pAt this point, I understand that it would be bad practice to use the UUID generated by the client as the objects PK in my database. The reason for this is that a malicious user could modify the generated UUID and force PK collisions on my DB.p  pTo mitigate any damages which would be incurred from forcing a PK collision on PlaylistItem, I chose to define the PK as a composite of two IDs  the clientgenerated UUID and a servergenerated GUID. The servergenerated GUID is the PlaylistItems Playlists ID.p  pNow, I have been using this solution for a while, but I dont understand whybelieve my solution is any better than simply trusting the client ID. If the user is able to force a PK collison with another users PlaylistItem objects then I think I should assume they could also provide that users PlaylistId. They could still force collisons.p  pSo... yeah. Whats the proper way of doing something like this Allow the client to create a UUID, server gives a thumbs updown when successfully saved. If a collision is found, revert the client changes and notify of collison detected p

My problem is I have popOverViewController, in that imageview. when i touch in that imageview, delegate methods are not called.p  pI do it in another way, it is i subview the image view in codeUIViewcode, in this case delegates are called. when i assigned that imageview to PopOverView, delegates are not called.p  phere is the sample code p  precode ifpopOverViewBool    signatureImageView.imagenil  [currentTextField resignFirstResponder]  [currentTextView resignFirstResponder]  red  0.0255.0  green  0.0255.0  blue  0.0255.0  brush  2.210.0  opacity  1.0    UIViewController popOverVCont  [[UIViewController alloc] init]  popOverVCont.viewmyView  popOverVCont.contentSizeForViewInPopover CGSizeMake590, 350   self.popoverController  [[UIPopoverController alloc]  initWithContentViewControllerpopOverVCont]   popoverController.delegate  self   [popoverController presentPopoverFromRectCGRectMake137, 460, 320, 10 inViewself.view permittedArrowDirectionsUIPopoverArrowDirectionDown animatedYES]  popOverViewBoolNO    else    [popoverController presentPopoverFromRectCGRectMake137, 460, 320, 10 inViewself.view permittedArrowDirectionsUIPopoverArrowDirectionDown animatedYES]       voidtouchesBeganNSSet touches withEventUIEvent event   mouseSwiped  NO UITouch touch  [touches anyObject] lastPoint  [touch locationInViewself.view] lastPoint  [touch locationInViewself.drawSignView]    voidtouchesMovedNSSet touches withEventUIEvent event   mouseSwiped  YES UITouch touch  [touches anyObject] CGPoint currentPoint  [touch locationInViewself.view] CGPoint currentPoint  [touch locationInViewself.drawSignView]  UIGraphicsBeginImageContextself.view.frame.size UIGraphicsBeginImageContextself.drawSignView.frame.size   [self.tempDrawImage.image drawInRectCGRectMake0, 0, self.view.frame.size.width, self.view.frame.size.height] [self.tempDrawImage.image drawInRectCGRectMake0, 0, self.drawSignView.frame.size.width, self.drawSignView.frame.size.height] CGContextMoveToPointUIGraphicsGetCurrentContext, lastPoint.x, lastPoint.y CGContextAddLineToPointUIGraphicsGetCurrentContext, currentPoint.x, currentPoint.y CGContextSetLineCapUIGraphicsGetCurrentContext, kCGLineCapRound CGContextSetLineWidthUIGraphicsGetCurrentContext, brush  CGContextSetRGBStrokeColorUIGraphicsGetCurrentContext, red, green, blue, 1.0 CGContextSetBlendModeUIGraphicsGetCurrentContext,kCGBlendModeNormal  CGContextStrokePathUIGraphicsGetCurrentContext self.tempDrawImage.image  UIGraphicsGetImageFromCurrentImageContext [self.tempDrawImage setAlphaopacity] UIGraphicsEndImageContext  lastPoint  currentPoint      voidtouchesEndedNSSet touches withEventUIEvent event   ifmouseSwiped      UIGraphicsBeginImageContextself.view.frame.size     UIGraphicsBeginImageContextself.drawSignView.frame.size       [self.tempDrawImage.image drawInRectCGRectMake0, 0, self.view.frame.size.width, self.view.frame.size.height]     [self.tempDrawImage.image drawInRectCGRectMake0, 0, self.drawSignView.frame.size.width, self.drawSignView.frame.size.height]     CGContextSetLineCapUIGraphicsGetCurrentContext, kCGLineCapRound     CGContextSetLineWidthUIGraphicsGetCurrentContext, brush     CGContextSetRGBStrokeColorUIGraphicsGetCurrentContext, red, green, blue, opacity     CGContextMoveToPointUIGraphicsGetCurrentContext, lastPoint.x, lastPoint.y     CGContextAddLineToPointUIGraphicsGetCurrentContext, lastPoint.x, lastPoint.y     CGContextStrokePathUIGraphicsGetCurrentContext     CGContextFlushUIGraphicsGetCurrentContext     self.tempDrawImage.image  UIGraphicsGetImageFromCurrentImageContext     UIGraphicsEndImageContext   UIGraphicsBeginImageContextself.mainImage.frame.size [self.mainImage.image drawInRectCGRectMake0, 0, self.view.frame.size.width, self.view.frame.size.height blendModekCGBlendModeNormal alpha1.0] [self.mainImage.image drawInRectCGRectMake0, 0, self.drawSignView.frame.size.width, self.drawSignView.frame.size.height blendModekCGBlendModeNormal alpha1.0]   [self.tempDrawImage.image drawInRectCGRectMake0, 0, self.view.frame.size.width, self.view.frame.size.height blendModekCGBlendModeNormal alphaopacity] [self.tempDrawImage.image drawInRectCGRectMake0, 0, self.drawSignView.frame.size.width, self.drawSignView.frame.size.height blendModekCGBlendModeNormal alphaopacity] self.mainImage.image  UIGraphicsGetImageFromCurrentImageContext self.tempDrawImage.image  nil UIGraphicsEndImageContext  codepre  pi Google it, but i did not find any answer..

Negative 752 pI am developing an android app that has quite a few layouts. So far I have been naming these by what the layout is used for followed by a name for the layout eg activitybase.xml, fragmentmainmenu.xml. As I have noticed android supports no sub directories for the resources folders. Already with 12 layout files things are starting to get a bit cramped. I was wondering if anyone had any good naming strategies to keep this awful one directory setup organized.p

Negative 752 pI dont believe this feature exists in Java, and probably for good reason, but occasionally I like to codeimport staticcode a lot of methods in multiple classes, or even codeimport static ltpackagegt.ltClassgt.code a variety of classes Mostly used in a static context, like C. Java obviously doesnt have any kind of codeincludecode feature, whereby I could codeinclude importscode, so I was wondering if there are any IDE plugins Eclipse or IntelliJ, or other tools to support such a featurep  pThat is to say Is it possible to import a group of import statements from another file in Java p  pSide note I am well aware that this type of coding is against Java style, and potentially misleading to other people reading my code, but this is for hobby projects mainly.p

Negative 752 pIm trying to learn Autolayout, so Im reading through tutorials and also messing around with some UIViews just to see what I can get them to do. Im wondering how I would accomplish something like the picture below on the transition from portrait to landscape with autolayout I thought, for example, that if I pinned the yellow to the top of the view, the blue to the yellow, the orange to the blue, and the orange to the bottom, they would resize proportionally, maintaining the 20 pixels between each other and the top and bottom of the view. But the blue box, for example, wont let me remove its strut to the top of the view, even though its pinned to the yellow view above it, so its pushing everything down and off the screen in landscape. I know you can pin heights and widths equally to get them to resize, but is there any way to resize things proportionally, maintaining the spacing between them img srchttpi.stack.imgur.comTzshx.png altenter image description herep

Negative 752 pIm on a team building a large ASP.NET MVC application. Id like to have a place holder that shows the string Not Yet Implemented when a menu option is selected that has not been implemented by the team yet. I started by returning codethis.ContentNot yet Implementedcode but this method does not render the layout which contains the menu so the testers are led into a dead end. Is there a way to render just that string inside the layout without creating a view I dont want to create a view thats just going to be deleted when the project is complete.p  pstrongEDITstrong Im sorry if Im unclear here but the goal is to render an arbitrary string as a view. Suggesting I create a code.cshtmlcode file does not answer my question. Im going to solve my problem by implementing the error handling and throwing the exception which feels more right anyway. Im leaving the question up anyway though because Im curious if what I originally wanted to do is even possible.p

Negative 752 pHas anyone implemented a capped datastructure of any kind in Redis Im working on building something like a news feed. The feed will wind up being manipulated and read from very frequently, and holding it in a sorted set in Redis would be cheap and perfect for my use case. The only issue is I only ever need n items per feed, and Im worried about memory overflow, so Id like to ensure each feed never gets above n items. It seems pretty trivial to make a capped sorted collection in Redis with Luap  precoderediscli EVAL cat updatefeed.lua 1 feedssomefeed thingtoadd, n codepre  pWhere updatefeed.lua looks something like without testing itp  precoderedis.callZADD, KEYS[1], os.time, ARGV[1] local num  redis.callZCARD, KEYS[1] if num gt ARGV[2]     redis.callZREMRANGEBYRANK, KEYS[1], n, inf codepre  pThats not bad at all, and pretty cheap, but it seems like such a basic thing that could be doable much more cheaply by instantiating the sorted set with only n buckets to begin with. I cant find a way to do that in redis, so I guess my question is did I miss something, and if I didnt, why is there no structure for this in redis, even if it just ran the basic Lua script I described, it seems like it would be a typical enough usecase that it ought to be implemented as an option for redis data structuresp

It serves as fallback solution when  every other rewriteredirect fails e.g. in an aliased environment without  modrewrite. Additionally, this reduces the matching process for the  startpage path  because otherwise Apache will apply the rewritting rules  to each configured DirectoryIndex file e.g. index.php, index.html, index.pl. DirectoryIndex app.php  ltIfModule modrewrite.cgt     RewriteEngine On       Redirect to URI without front controller to prevent duplicate content      with and without app.php. Only do this redirect on the initial      rewrite by Apache and not on subsequent cycles. Otherwise we would get an      endless redirect loop request gt rewrite to front controller gt      redirect gt request gt ....      So in case you get a too many redirects error or you always get redirected      to the startpage because your Apache does not expose the REDIRECTSTATUS      environment variable, you have 2 choices       disable this feature by commenting the following 2 lines or       use Apache gt 2.3.9 and replace all L flags by END flags and remove the        following RewriteCond best solution     RewriteCond ENVREDIRECTSTATUS      RewriteRule app.php.

The      condition ensures that if you are using Apache aliases to do mass virtual      hosting, the base path will be prepended to allow proper resolution of the      app.php file it will work in nonaliased environments as well, providing      a safe, onesize fits all solution.

Okay, but when i use client application instead of modem and call codeSocket.Closecode in it, codeNetworkStream.ReadBytecode on server side simply returns code1code.p  pSo whats the difference between situation that caused codeWSAECONNRESETcode exception and the situation when client manually closes the socketp

Negative 752 pemstrongNOTE Added After  I finally got numpydoc working.  It was also a python 2 problem. I ran 2to3 on it and now it seems to be working.emstrongp  pOK, Ive spent an entire day trying to get any Sphinx extension to work and am now hoping someone could point out what Im doing wrong. Sorry this is a bit long, but maybe more info will help you quickly find the error of my ways.p  pSphinx seems to be working as advertised, but I would like to use NumPy style documentation so thought Id install numpydoc.  In case it matters, Im using Python 3.3 winpython 64 bit on windows 7.  I started with the directions a hrefhttpcodeandchaos.wordpress.com20120809sphinxandnumpydoc relnofollowherea but got the errorp  precodeExtension error Could not import extension numpydoc exception cannot import name setup codepre  pGoogling that I found that some people got around it by using codenumpydoc.numpydoccode  No dice. I made sure everything possibly relevant was in my path as well as added into sys.path in sphinxs codeconf.pycode file.  I even tried copying numpydoc into sphinxs ext folder and changing the extension string accordingly, still no luck.p  pAt this point I gave up on numpdoc and decided to try napoleon.  Following the installation directions I just codepip install sphinxcontribnapoleoncode and then should be good to go. But alas, no, as napoleon seems to be in 2.x not 3 though the egg says codeSphinx1.1.3py3.3.egginfocode and during installation it says it is installing codesphinxcontribnapoleon0.2.1py3.3nspkg.pthcode.  Nonetheless, lots of python 2 code. I tried converting it with 2to3 but then I get a recursion too deep error.p  pSo, I decide to see if I am capable of installing any extension to sphinx.  I essentially at random pick findanything.  Install it as requested and it also fails, this time because of a relpath error codeValueError path is on mount C, start on mount Dcode.  Which I guess means that it is unhappy that my python installation is on C but my code Im trying to document and where Im trying to run sphinx is on D and that Im running Windows.p  pSo, did I just happen to pick 3 troubled extensions  Or, if not, what am I doing wrong and more importantly how can I do it right so that I get this workingp  pPS  Im completely new to Python so please dont assume that Im not making an incredibly stupid and basic error.p
Negative 752 pSorry I know earlier some people have same kind of questions but I am suffering from the same issue and dont get a clear view from the earlier questions. p  blockquote   pI found Android very complex for the developer to deal with Multiple   dimensions. Like there are devices from ldpi to xxhdpi and tablets.p blockquote  pWhat I have observed is there are different folder structure for the Images like ldpi, mdpi, hdpi and xhdpi and for tablets sw600dp7inch and sw720dp10inch. p  pNow the problem is there are many handsets have size 5 inch but there resolution is different and for tablets also the case is same. So I am confused and what size of images I asked to make to Designer for different handsets and mobile because resolution is very from device to device. p  pI also check the links a hrefhttpdeveloper.android.comtrainingbasicssupportingdevicesscreens.htmlhttpdeveloper.android.comtrainingbasicssupportingdevicesscreens.htmla   But didnt clear idea. p  pI am new to android .

Negative 752 pI have to state whether the following are regular sets. These are my answers, I would like to know if I am correct and get additional input on my reasoning. Also, I want to rationalize these intuitively without using the pumping lemma, which I have been told is not too difficult for any of the following. p  pI only need to show the question at the bottom formally.p  precode   a. anbm  nm     b. xcx  x is in a,b    c. xcy  x,y is in a,b    d. anbn481  n gt 0    e. anbm  ngtm and mlt 481    f. anbm  ngtm and mgt 481    h. anbncn  ngt0   a. Not regular. This would imply that anbn  ngt0 is regular, which isnt true either by the closure properties for regular sets. b. For both b and c, I dont think I am conceptualizing it correctly. Since x can be any arbitrary string of as or bs, I would say that both parts b and c are not regular. But I dont think that this is correct. c. See above. d. Not regular. From the same reasoning from a. Adding a constant really means nothing since n is unbounded positively.  e. Unsure. f. Unsure. h. Not regular from the same reasoning as a. codepre  pFinally I must emformallyem prove that there is no infinite subset of anbn  n0 such that the subset is regular. p  pCan this be done in a simple way without the Pumping Lemma Since I dont have a very good grasp on regular sets I havent attempted this yet.p

Negative 752 pIn C, I have to implement an ExcelAccesslike quote querybuilder to allow custom sorting of a dataset. If you sort by columns A, B and C in Excel using the query builder or ORDER BY a, b, c in SQL, you get all the As in order, all the Bs within each group of identical As in order, and all the Cs within each group of identical Bs in order, which is what most people understand by sortorder by a, b, c. This seems to be the same as doing sort by c, then sort by b, then sort by a  ie. sorting individually on each column in reverse order  as long as you use stablesort. Which is how Ive implemented it in my program. User says sort by a, b, c, program does stablesort by c, stablesort by b, stablesort by a  same result, with all the datasets Ive used so far. My question is, is this a wellknown equivalence that holds true for any dataset strongprovided a stable sort algorithm is usedstrong and any combination of columns, and is there even a mathematical proof for it I have not found any such proof via Google or other means asking programmers, statisticians and mathematicians so far.p

Negative 752 pI have a class that wraps around a Bitmap and I would like to have a way of knowing if the bitmap has been changed via SetPixel or GDI.p  pI dont need to know exactly when it happens, I just need a way to tell if it has happened since the last check.p  pNow, Im assuming that something like that isnt already packed in the Bitmap class, so what would be the best way to solve this problemp  pI could provide my own wrapper functions for GetPixel and SetPixel, but then Id have no idea if the Bitmap was changed using GDI. I COULD make a wrapper for that too but that really seems like a huge overkill.p  pAnother possible option would be to save a copy and then check pixel by pixel. This would obviously work and would be trivial to write but its much too slow for my needs.p

By applying median filtering, the illuminative component of the input image, excluding the detailed formation of the eye regions, can be approximated, as shown in Fig. 6b.p      pHere, the optimal size of the median filter is empirically determined experimentally in terms of the eye detection accuracy. Then,the inverted illuminative image is obtained, as shown in Fig. 6c.   The influence of the illuminative variation is compensated for by adding the inverted image to the original L image. Consequently, an illuminationcompensated RGB image is acquired, as shown in Fig. 6d.p      pFig. 7 shows the result of the binarized eye image using the proposed illumination normalization. In this binarization procedure, the threshold is automatically determined on the basis of the study byGonzalez and Woods 2002. The binarization result shown in   Fig. 7b is much better than those shown in Fig. 5b and c.p      pFig. 8 shows other examples of binarized eye images after illumination normalization p blockquote  pstrongEditstrongp  pimg srchttpimageshack.comaimg8372086w665.jpg altFig.5p  pimg srchttpimageshack.comaimg4406157kmo6.jpg altFig.6p  pimg srchttpimageshack.comaimg75584rloq.jpg altFig.7p  pFor color space conversion I am using code from a hrefhttpwww.codeproject.comArticles19045ManipulatingcolorsinNETPart1xyz2 relnofollowthisa link.p  pstrongMy code isstrongp  precodevoid RGBtoXYZBitmap bm, int row, int col, CIEXYZ[,] xyz       for int i  0 i lt row i              for int j  0 j lt col j                      xyz[i, j]  ColorSpaceHelper.RGBtoXYZbm.GetPixelj, i.R, bm.GetPixelj, i.G, bm.GetPixelj, i.B                 void XYZtoLABCIEXYZ[,] xyz, int row, int col, CIELab[,] lab      for int i  0 i lt row i              for int j  0 j lt col j                      lab[i, j]  ColorSpaceHelper.XYZtoLabxyz[i, j]                 void LABtoXYZCIEXYZ[,] xyz, int row, int col, CIELab[,] lab      for int i  0 i lt row i              for int j  0 j lt col j                      xyz[i, j]  ColorSpaceHelper.LabtoXYZlab[i, j]                 void XYZtoRGBBitmap bm, int row, int col, CIEXYZ[,] xyz      Devcorp.Controls.Design.RGB rgb     for int i  0 i lt row i              for int j  0 j lt col j                      rgb  ColorSpaceHelper.XYZtoRGBxyz[i, j]             bm.SetPixelj, i, Color.FromArgbrgb.Red, rgb.Green, rgb.Blue                void MedianLabImageCIELab[,] lab, int row, int col, int filterwidth      double value  0     for int i  0 i lt row i              for int j  0 j lt col j                      value  0             for int r  0 r lt filterwidth r                              for int c  0 c lt filterwidth c                                      int imager  Math.MinMath.Maxi  r, 0, row  1                     int imagec  Math.MinMath.Maxj  c, 0, col  1                      value  lab[imager, imagec].L                                            value  filterwidth  filterwidth  1             lab[i, j].L  value                void MyFunction      System.Drawing.Bitmap img  new System.Drawing.BitmapCUsersHaseebDesktopUntitled.bmpCUsersHaseebDesktopEyeBmp.bmp       int imgRow, imgCol     imgRow  img.Height     imgCol  img.Width       CIEXYZ[,] xyzImage  new CIEXYZ[imgRow, imgCol]     CIELab[,] labImage  new CIELab[imgRow, imgCol]      RGBtoXYZimg, imgRow, imgCol, xyzImage     XYZtoLABxyzImage, imgRow, imgCol, labImage      MedianLabImagelabImage, imgRow, imgCol, 9My confusion starts after this       LABtoXYZxyzImage, imgRow, imgCol, labImage     XYZtoRGBimg, imgRow, imgCol, xyzImage  codepre  pCan anyone please confirm that I am doing this correctly Also my main question is what do the authors mean by p  blockquote   pThen, the inverted illuminative image is obtained, as shown inFig. 6c.p blockquote  pand p  blockquote   pThe influence of the illuminative variation is compensated for by adding the inverted image to the original L image.

How can I add the backspace again without removing my filterp  pEdit Thank you for your answers. Ive added the function to public void remove and now my removal works again. But I noticed that it stores my text input backwards. if I write 12345 and then use my int length1 it removes 1, then 2 and so on.

Negative 752 pSimilar question here a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions6265746resizeformwhilekeepingaspectratioResize Form while keeping aspect ratioap  pBasically, what I want is to resize form and maintain its aspect ratio, but I want resizing to follow the cursor as well. The answer in the topic above provided solution that is halfsatisfactory  it works, but resizing is working 2x slower than it should. When I start to resize the form by X axis, you can see where the cursor is, and what the form size isp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comfnXqi.png althttpi.imgur.comSUIli7N.pngp  pI thought that since it resizes 2x slower, I should omit 0.5 multiplier in the code and it will work, but no dice. Here is the code that Im using at the momentp  precodetype   TfrmTable  classTForm     procedure FormCanResizeSender TObject var NewWidth, NewHeight Integer var Resize Boolean     procedure FormCreateSender TObject   private     FAspectRatio Double   public   end  var   frmTable TfrmTable  implementation  R .dfm  procedure TfrmTable.FormCreateSender TObject begin   FAspectRatio  Width  Height end  procedure TfrmTable.FormCanResizeSender TObject var NewWidth, NewHeight Integer var Resize Boolean begin   NewHeight  Round0.50  NewHeight  NewWidth  FAspectRatio   NewWidth  RoundNewHeight  FAspectRatio end codepre  pIve tried another approach, by using something like thisp  precodeprocedure TfrmTable.FormCanResizeSender TObject var NewWidth, NewHeight Integer var Resize Boolean begin   if NewWidth ltgt Width then     NewHeight  RoundNewWidth  FAspectRatio   else     if NewHeight ltgt Height then       NewWidth  RoundNewHeight  FAspectRatio end codepre  pWhat this should do Well, my thinking is that I first check if codeNewWidthcode is different than current codeWidthcode, and if it is, that means user is resizing form by X axis. Then I should set codeNewHeightcode to appropriate value. Otherwise, I check if codeNewHeightcode is different than current codeHeightcode, and set codeNewWidthcode value to its appropriate value. This also produces weird results, when I drag form by X axis, it seems to work, and as soon as I stop resizing, form returns to its original size  I concluded that once I stop resizing let mouse button up, codeFormCanResizecode event gets called with old codeNewHeightcode value, which then reverts form back to its old size.p

Negative 752 pIve just started to get to grips with regex in notepad and Ive tasked myself with formatting a chunk of JSON data into something human readable, as well as something that can be read into an algorithm a colleague of mine wrote.

Negative 752 pok so i am trying to make a small java paint program but i am having trouble trying to get my buttons to work. I was able to get one color when i instantiated the MyPanel class, but i changed it around in an attempt to make use of my buttons.

Im really new to programming so any advice you guys could give me would be much appreciated. I also have an extra class that is instantiated in the MyPanel class which i didnt bother putting in because i know the problem isnt in there.

Negative 752 pI recently decided to take a look at 2D graphics with C, using MinGW on Windows 7.p  pSince I was only going to need 2D graphics any library would be viable more or less OpenGL, SDL, etc... I decided to take a quick look at a few and check how easy theyd be to get working on windows with MinGW.p  pI soon noticed every library I tested which were Cairo, SDL and GTK required tons of dll files in order to work. After compiling even a simple program from something like a tutorial it would give me like 5 or 6 different dll errors, forcing me to copy all of them into my programs working directory for it to even run.p  pOf course my program worked, but its very cubersome to have this many DLLs just for a simple program. Making the program run on someone elses computer would require to ship all those DLLs along with it as seperate files, plus other DLLs that I got globally installed but others dont.p  pIt just seems so weird that something as popular as C would be so annoying to use because of all the DLLs required... Am I doing anything wrong Could there be some magical solution to this problem Some tool to minimize or even completely eliminate these complications Itd be cool to have to use fewer DLLs for my application. Of course I wont be able to omit DLLs completely, but at least reducing the amount to a single one one library  one DLL or having the possibility to organize them in a subfolder of their own would be awesome.p

I filter like thisp  precodeListltTgt myList  myCoolListGetter IteratorltTgt it  myList.iterator T curr while it.hasNext      curr  it.next     if curr.shouldNotBeInResult          myList.removecurr       codepre  pI then pass this codeListltTgtcode to another method which performs those computations I mentioned, adding them to a codeSetltStringgtcode.p  pIm thinking perhaps I could save some time by inserting the elements which should be in the result rather into a codeSetltTgtcode rather than removing them from the codeListltTgtcode. Since I am already iterating over the codeListltTgtcode here, and have to construct a codeSetltStringgtcode later anyway, would I actually be saving time by doing thatp

Negative 752 pThis is hard to explain so bear with me.p  pIm building a page that consists of multiple forms that are all submitted with one submit button at the bottom like sop  precodeltform action methodpostgt ltinput typetext namename1 valueltvariable1gt placeholderType here...gt  ltform action methodpostgt ltinput typetext namename2 valueltvariable2gt placeholderType here...gt  ltform action methodpostgt ltinput typetext namename3 valueltvariable3gt placeholderType here...gt  ltform action methodpostgt ltinput typetext namename4 valueltvariable4gt placeholderType here...gt ltinput typesubmit namesubmit valueSubmitgt  ltformgt codepre  pEach of these forms asks the user for data, which then echos to a text box so that they can copypaste the output.p  pNow, suppose the user fills out the data for one of these forms only and clicks on the submit button.

Negative 752 pI want to create a scatter plot matrix which will be composed by some subplots. I have extracted from a .txt file my data and created an array of shape codex,y,z,p1,p2,p3,p4code. The first three columns of the array represent the x,y,z coordinates from the original image that these data come from and the last four columns p1, p2, p3, p4 some other parameters. Consequently, in each row of the array the parameters p1, p2, p3, p4 have the same coordinatesx,y,z.In the scatter plot, I want to visualize each pie.g. p1 parameter against the other pie.g. p2, p3, p4 parameters.p  pI want to draw a region of interestROI in every subplot, highlight the points that are included in the ROI in every subplot. In each subplot different parameters are visualizede.g. p1 vs p2 but for one point in each subplot there is another point with the same x, y, z coordinates in the rest subplots. I implemented the drawing of the ROI by using the codematplotlibcode example a hrefhttpmatplotlib.orgexampleseventhandlinglassodemo.html relnofollowLassoa. An example of what this code implements is shown in the following figure. img srchttpi.stack.imgur.comxxg2o.png altFigure 1 p  pThere is a malfunction in my implementation. I can draw lassos in every subplot, but points are highlighted only, when a lasso is drawn in specific subplot which corresponds to the first call of the codeLassoManagercode function in my code in my code codeselector1code. As it can be seen in the next figure, an initial value is given to lassos that can be drawn in the different subplots, but only the id that corresponds in selector 1 is used causing the malfunction of the code, independently in which subplot I drew a ROI. p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.com9eRDs.png altFigure 2p  pHere is my codep  precode Show how to use a lasso to select a set of points and get the indices of the selected points.

Negative 752 pI currently need to write a CCLI wrapper for a native C library TetGen for later use in a C project. I have read quite a few articles on how to do this but am at a loss with my linker errors. A chap called Sam Agten tried to accomplish this too, as he states in his a hrefhttpsamagten.blogspot.de20111101archive.html relnofollowBloga which led me to a series on C Interop a hrefhttpblogs.msdn.combborisjarchive20060729683061.aspx relnofollowPart 1a, a hrefhttpblogs.msdn.combborisjarchive20060821711530.aspx relnofollowPart 2a, a hrefhttpblogs.msdn.combborisjarchive20060902737144.aspx relnofollowPart 3a, a hrefhttpblogs.msdn.combborisjarchive20060928769708.aspx relnofollowPart 4a, a hrefhttpblogs.msdn.combborisjarchive20070209interop101part5.aspxRedirectedtrue relnofollowPart 5a, where Part 3 is supposed to explain how to do what I accomplish.p  pBecause Sam wanted to integrate TetGen with Unity he at last had to resort to CStyleWrappers. Now, if Im not entirely mistaken, I have tried using CStyleWrappers on a previous, related project.p  pBecause my wrapped TetGen must run on a Windows Server 2008 I think my first question is strongWill a CCLIWrapper work in a ServerEnvironmentstrongp  pI started writing a very simple wrapper according to aforementioned Part 3, which failed miserably. Anyway I tried to create a simple wrapper library along the line of thought, which I want to share with you. I began by creating a Cproject which ultimatly should use my wrapped library and added first a new project from the Win32subsection of Cprojects SimpleAdd.p  precodeSimpleAdd.h class declspecdllexport SimpleAdd  public     SimpleAdd     SimpleAdd      int Addint a,int b   SimpleAdd.cpp include SimpleAdd.h int SimpleAddAddint a, int b      return ab  codepre  pIn the project settings I made sure, that it compiled to a strongstatic library .libstrong and strongnostrong CLRSupport was used. From the preprocessor definition I assume the lib is to target x86 systems WIN32. Everything is left pretty much on standard values. If I rightclick  build it will successfully build a lib called SimpleAdd.lib.p  pOne thing I was pointed to through other posts If I open the lib in DependencyWalker, I get an error saying No DOS or PE signature found. This file is not a valid 32bit or 64bit Windows module which is kind of frustrating. strongWhat do I have to to to make DependencyWalker stop showing this errorstrong, since I think this 3264problem might hint to a solution.p  pAnyway, I have my lib, now I want to wrap it up. So I created a new project in my solution called AddWrapper, using the CLRClassLibrarytemplate of the Cbranch.p  precode AddWrapper.h pragma once include ..SimpleAddSimpleAdd.h using namespace System  namespace AddWrapper  public ref class ManagedSimpleAdd  private     SimpleAdd sa public     ManagedSimpleAdd     ManagedSimpleAdd     int Addint a, int b    AddWrapper.cpp include AddWrapper.h using namespace AddWrapper  ManagedSimpleAddManagedSimpleAdd  sanew SimpleAdd    ManagedSimpleAddManagedSimpleAdddelete sa  int ManagedSimpleAddAddint a, int b      return sagtAdda,b  codepre  pAs both Cprojects are in seperate folders on the same hierarchical level, I specified the relative path to the headerfile. In the project settings I now have the configuration standard strong.dllstrong and the strongclrstrongswitch. In my VC folders I added the path to the Debugdirectory of my whole soultion, because this is where the referenced lib is compiled to. In my linkersettings under additional dependencies I added the name SimpleAdd.lib.p  pWhen I want to build my wrapper however, there is a problem, or rather 5 of themp  blockquote   pFehler 3 error LNK2028 Nicht aufgelstes Token 0A00000B public thiscall SimpleAddSimpleAddvoid 0SimpleAddFQAEXZ, auf das in Funktion public clrcall AddWrapperManagedSimpleAddManagedSimpleAddvoid 0ManagedSimpleAddAddWrapperFQAAMXZ verwiesen wird.   pathAddWrapperAddWrapper.obj    AddWrapper   Fehler 4   error LNK2028 Nicht aufgelstes Token 0A00000C public thiscall SimpleAddSimpleAddvoid 1SimpleAddFQAEXZ, auf das in Funktion public void  thiscall SimpleAddcodescalar deleting destructorunsigned int GSimpleAddFQAEPAXIZ verwiesen wird.   pathAddWrapperAddWrapper.obj    AddWrapper   Fehler 5   error LNK2019 Verweis auf nicht aufgelstes externes Symbol public thiscall SimpleAddSimpleAddvoid 0SimpleAddFQAEXZ in Funktion public clrcall AddWrapperManagedSimpleAddManagedSimpleAddvoid 0ManagedSimpleAddAddWrapperFQAAMXZ.  pathAddWrapperAddWrapper.obj    AddWrapper   Fehler 6   error LNK2019 Verweis auf nicht aufgelstes externes Symbol public thiscall SimpleAddSimpleAddvoid 1SimpleAddFQAEXZ in Funktion public void  thiscall SimpleAddcodescalar deleting destructorunsigned int GSimpleAddFQAEPAXIZ.    pathAddWrapperAddWrapper.obj    AddWrapper   Fehler 7   error LNK1120 4 nicht aufgelste Externe   pathDebugAddWrapper.dll 1   1   AddWrapperp blockquote  pNow, strongwhat could be the cause of these errorsstrong Is it the platformbefuddeledness of the lib Did I miss to specify something elsep

Within this panel there are some comboboxes in order to select various filter criteria. Usually some of the options are too long to be contained in the sidebar area, and Im not able to see the entire option name, due to the horizontal overflow. This sidebar is already vertical scrollable and the only way  Ive found to see the options outside the sidebar area is to set overflow to visible.

Negative 752 pI am connecting to a website, logging in, and grabbing the HTML source of the page with an NSURLRequest, which is working fine. I confirm the html source is what I need by printing it to the console. The problem is that I need to get the rendered HTML after the javascript code finishes. From my research, the only way to do this is by loading that into a UIWebView which I am trying to do. However, when I do this, the webViewDidFinishLoad delegate never fires. Neither does the webViewDidStartLoad. I dont want to display the UIWebView anywhere since its only purpose is to get the rendered HTML for me. Here is my code so farp  precodeimport UIKit  class ShowParser  NSObject, UIWebViewDelegate      var webView  UIWebView      init              super.init         webView.delegate  self         sendRequest           funs sendRequest              var requestUrl  NSURLstring ltwebsitegt         var baseUrl  NSURLstring ltwebsitegt         var nsurlRequest  NSMutableURLRequestURL requestUrl         nsurlRequest.HTTPMethod  POST         nsurlRequest.setValueapplicationxwwwformurlencoded, forHTTPHeaderField ContentType         var submitData  submitloginamplastplaceampemailltusernamegtamppasswordltpasswordgt         var requestBodyData  submitData.dataUsingEncodingNSUTF8StringEncoding, allowLossyConversion false         nsurlRequest.HTTPBody  requestBodyData         var data  NSURLConnection.sendSynchronousRequestnsurlRequest, returningResponse nil, error nil         var dataResultsString  NSStringdata data, encoding NSUTF8StringEncoding         printlndataResultsString         webView.loadHTMLStringdataResultsString, baseURL baseUrl           func webViewDidStartLoadwebView UIWebView              printlnStarted Loading           func webViewDidFinishLoadwebView UIWebView              printlnFinished Loading       codepre

Negative 752 pI have a page that is supposed to be used internally within the company only. The site however is deployed publicly. I tried validating IP addresses using a filter attribute, however the web server is behind a proxy that returns all IP addresses as the same regardless of where the requests came from.

Not sure how to approach this, but this would require having the internal server name in the client side js.

Negative 752 pI have to do a task of importing data to mysql from a text file using php code, yeah its sound so easy, and I have already done that before like importing data from csv file, from excel file or any text file where data is separated with any delimiter. But in my current case, there is no any delimiter just two spaces and the fix length of field. For examplep  precodetable field   id8 name50   state15  category10                                              codepre  psample data of upload.txt filep  pformatp  pID  NAME ADDRESS CATEGORYp  pre classlangnone prettyprintoverridecode10719922  Union Bank of India                                 delhi            normal       10719956  State Bank of India                                 mumbai           normal       10719522  HDFC Bank                                           gujrat           high         10759924  ICICI Bank                                          goa              normal       codepre  pNow you can understand the data format of text file, i.e. field length  two spaces, field length  two spaces and so on. The problem is if the data is not matches with the field size then again spaces are hare to complete the length of field thats why two space are not available as delimiter. Like take the first of data id have 8 digit data than two spaces and name length 50 but data have only 19 character so there is 31 spaces to complete the length 50 after that two space then next field. So I have no delimiter or syntax rather than length  2 spaces to identify the single field data. I am very confused how to import this data to MySQL using php script. does any one think It can be happen. Please I need some idea or php code, to handle this situation. Thank You p
Negative 752 pIm looking for a good way to manage deployment to a test environment of several branches of the same codebase. My setup includes a Main branch and several Dev branchesp  ul liMainli liDev1 feature set 1li liDev2 feature set 2li lietc...li ul  pThese are all part of a continuous integration process where they get deployed daily for testing. At the moment there is a Testing configuration, with corresponding Web.config transformation and publish profile, that control things like connection strings Web.config and location to deploy the application to MSDeploy configuration in the publish profile.p  pIt all worked fine until merging started happening. Once we start merging code, the different Web.config transformations and publish profiles inevitably get mixed up, and Visual Studio happily merges everything without finding conflicts, resulting in situations like the Main branch being deployed to the Dev1 location, or the Dev2 application getting configured with Mains connection string.p  pI can think of one solution, which is creating a solution configuration for each branch, and the corresponding Web.config transformations and publish profiles. This would definitely do the job of keeping everything separate and safe from merging problems, but it creates a whole lot of new configuration files all over the place. And on top of that it makes the task of creating or deleting a branch much more complicated.p  pIs there another way of doing itp

Negative 752 pIm building a website with laravel and had some trouble with the documentation of the variables in an eloquent class. Ive seen that the eloquent class uses an attributesarray to store all the variables. Id like to document the available attributes in my classes so I can easily generate documentation and have codecompletion with descriptions. I tried declaring the variables in the classes for documentation. Ive tried declaring them public, but then the attributesarray isnt used anymore which is necessary. Declaring them protected works for the attributesarray, but the declared variables arent used and the documentation and declarations arent available in other files for codecompletion, suggestions and descriptions. I also would like to avoid getter and setters. Is there a convenient way of documenting those variables in laravel p  pThanks in advance  p

In my server, those 2 actions will be managed by 2 different files, say deleteEntries.php and excelExport.php.p  pSo, in my html I will have 2 forms, one pointing at deleteEntries.php and one pointing at excelExport.php.p  pThe problem is that each form needs to have its own inputs typehidden repeated.p  pThe codep  precodeltinput namevalue1 valuex typehiddengt ltinput namevalue2 valuey typehiddengt codepre  p, which is dynamically generated through PHP, must be repeated for each form how else can each serverside file know what the user needs to export or to delete. The code is dynamically generated because the search criteria and their values will differ between searches.p  pThen, if the user chooses to delete the data, the URL will becomep  pa hrefhttplocalhostdeleteEntries.phpvalue1xampvalue2y relnofollowhttplocalhostdeleteEntries.phpvalue1xampvalue2yap  pIn my specific occassion I have 3 forms and up to 11 values. So this means that I repeat 11 lines of HTML 3 times and I really dont like that for many reasons.p  pOne obvious solution would be a combobox where I let the user choose the action e.g. export data, delete data, option 3 and to manage all the actions with a single form and with a single serverside file by determining the selected action. But I dont want to do this because it is less userfriendly and less developerfriendly.p  pEdit The reason why I dont make a link for Export to excel likep  precodelta hrefhttplocalhostexcelExport.phpvalue1xampvalue2ygtExport to excelltagt codepre  pis because in reality user is given more options that have to be selected from a form.p

Negative 752 pI have a somewhat limited knowledge of JS and JQuery so I am sorry if this is a stupid question. I have a dashboard of charts which will have varying widths and also allows a user to change the width. The chart automatically adjusts its size. What I want is for the legend to appear under that chart but fill the width given. My issue is it seems that the number of columns for the legend is set once and unable to be updated. So if I a chart that covers the entire width of the page I want to be able to show a larger number of columns, but if the chart only has a small amount of width space I would like it to use less columns. I can capture the width and figure out the number of columns I would like but is it possible to redraw the legend dynamically Thanks for the helpp

Negative 752 pIve used dictionaries Whether they were called that or not in a number of other languages, but theres always been a method that can be called with on parameter that eitherp  pA Returns the associated value if the parameter is in use as a key, orBR B Indicates in some way that the parameter is not used as a keyp  pIve been forced into a position where I have to learn excelVBA and used the collections class for all of about five minutes before the lack of an .exists method led me to look for something else. The general consensus seems to be that the scripting.Dictionary class is the VBA equivalent of associative arraysdictionarieshashtables in other languages.p  pThe one thing I dont like the look of though is that the only way I can see of retrieving the value associated with a given key is to use the .items property either explicitly, or via scripting.Dictionarykey. But rather than doing anything to indicate the issue if key is not in use in the dictionary, it adds it.p  pI know I can use a if structure with .exists being the test to achieve the same functionality, and can write my own function that raises an error if the exists test fails, but it seems a lot of stuffing around to achieve what is core functionality in Python raises KeyError, PHP raises a Notice, Java Maps return null  although that is not necessarily ideal in the case of HashMaps where null actually is a valid value  but it does work as an indicator for HashTables.p  pSo is there any way of attempting to retrieve a value by key that will do something ideally throw an error if the key is not in use, rather than silently adding it Google hasnt provided any answers  but maybe Im just not phrasing the search well.p

Negative 752 pIm migrating to client certificate authentication instead of windows basic authentication for my ASP.NET Web App. Ive set user mapping in IIS 6.0 correctly and now I have a client certificate installed and mapped to a specific AD server account. I can login to the website using the installed certificate correctly and I can retrieve the mapped username correctly using Request.ServerVariables[LOGONUSER]. The problem is that I still need to retrieve the mapped user password however when I tried to use Request.ServerVariables[AUTHPASSWORD] it returns blank string Any ideas how to get the mapped user password correctlyp
Negative 752 pId like to ask for your help on creating a userdefined application in ns2.p  pI tried to create a new application for simulating scheduling policies by modifying the code of CBR traffic application.p  pIve finished c files and tried to do the simulation with the oTcl script. When I run the ns, it turns out that the application does not transmit any packet. To make sure that my Tcl script is correct, I change the application to CBR and then the program can indeed transmit packets.p  pIt seems that the Tcl commands could not access the functions which I define in the c domain. p  pShould I do anything else in the oTcl domain Im wondering if there is anyone who has ever came across the similar situation.p  pThe following are what Ive done so farp  ol liCreate a new application class in c domain.li liCreate a static shadow object by deriving from TclClassli liCreate instprocs by defining the function codeint commandargc, argvcode in c domain.li liIn oTcl domain define an instproc codeinitcode and use codesuperclasscode to declare that the new application is a derived class from Application class.li ol  pThank you very much for your generous help.p
Negative 752 pImprtant note this is only happening on clients, not in dev environmentp  pIm having an odd issue.  An application I have written  deployed at my company uses 3 connection strings within it to query data from various sources as needed.  Every so often, I get an error report from one of the end users machines stating something like p  blockquote   pSystem.InvalidOperationException   No connection string named CMPS1Context could be found in the application config file.p blockquote  pSo, I went to this machine, opened up the exe.config file, and sure enough, 2 of the connection string entries were just.... gone.  I went to my machine, grabbed the entries from my config, dropped them in, everything was working again.p  pI cant make heads or tails of this, nothing in my code is modifying the app.config user.config, yes.  I am using EntityFramework for all 3 databases.  Has anyone seen this, or maybe has an idea of what might be happeningp  pNote, this is not happening to all clients, it seems very very random at the moment, as I am unable to reproduce the error myself nor can anyone if they are tryingp  pFor the moment, my fix is going to be something retarded like watching for that error and when it occurs, reinsert the connection string, but... thats a very messy, ugly fix, that Id prefer NOT to put in production.  Any suggestions would be very helpfulp

Negative 752 pIm working with OpenTSDB for a school project. In the project I am supposed to create a structure for storing time series data from robots. The data is collected at a rate of 5 times per second, per robot and there can be up to a 100 active robots. p  pIve managed to set up OpenTSDB and link it to a HBase cluster. However after reading the documentation on a hrefhttpopentsdb.netdocsbuildhtmlindex.html relnofollowopenTSDBs websitea I feel I have no clear view of the data model.

What is the codevaluecode Why is it needed p  pGoing back to the robots each robot is identified by two IDs and each measurement consist of a total of 9 values. Hence each measurement is associated with a total of 11 valuestags. Putting this together with the need for a metric, value and a UnixTimestamp it amounts to a total of 14 tags in OpenTSDB. The default setup of OpenTSDB doesnt support that many values. I know that the number of tags can be increased by changing OpenTSDBs configuration file, but the internet has also told me that increasing the number of tags can dramatically a hrefhttpsgroups.google.comforumtopicopentsdb7oalcJYBVb0 relnofollowslow down queriesa. p  pAny suggestions on how I should tackle this Should I just increase the number of tags Or is there another way to solve thisp  pNote emAll the values associated with a measurement will always be accessed and plotted together.emp

Negative 752 pThere is a problem with a poorly chosen, noncomposable abstractions in Cocoa that arise when one tries to combine a Quick Look preview panel and a securityscoped URLs.p  pI have a concrete examplep  pImagine we are trying to show a preview for some objects from the MediaLibrary MediaLibrary.framework allows applications to browse the iPhoto, Aperture... and Photos libraries via convenient API.p  pThe most simple and straightforward way to do so is to adapt the MLMediaObject class that represent a particular photo or video item to implement the QLPreviewItem protocol which can be passed to the QLPreviewPanelp  pstrongMLMediaObjectPreviewItem.hstrongp  precodeimport ltMediaLibraryMLMediaObject.hgt  import ltQuartzQuartz.hgt  interface MLMediaObject PreviewItem ltQLPreviewItemgt  end codepre  pstrongMLMediaObjectPreviewItem.mstrongp  precodeimport MLMediaObjectPreviewItem.h  implementation MLMediaObject PreviewItem   NSURL previewItemURL    return self.URL    NSString previewItemTitle    return self.name   end codepre  pSimple. Now image the following QLPreviewPanel data source implementationp  pstrongAlbumViewController.mstrongp  precode NSInteger numberOfPreviewItemsInPreviewPanel QLPreviewPanel panel     currentAlbum property contains the currentlyrepresented MLMediaGroup object.   return self.currentAlbum.count    idltQLPreviewItemgt previewPanel QLPreviewPanel panel previewItemAtIndex NSInteger index    return self.currentAlbum[index]  codepre  pSo far so good. But if we look into the sparse and usually misleading Apple documentation, we may find out the following important detailsp  blockquote   pstrongURLstrongbr   The location of the media object. readonlybr   This property is provided as a securityscoped URL. In order to gain access to the file that this URL refers to, the caller must call codestartAccessingSecurityScopedResourcecode before and codestopAccessingSecurityScopedResourcecode after using the URL to access the file.p blockquote  pSo, it is obvious that access to the resource have to be bracketed with a codestartAccessingSecurityScopedResourcecodecodestopAccessingSecurityScopedResourcecode calls pair.p  pstrongThe question is where should I put these calls given the current codeQLPreviewPanelDataSourcecode protocol definitionstrong It is up to QLPreviewPanel to access the resource, not my code, but unfortunately I hardly ever will believe that Apple updated QL to operate in a sandboxingwise environment.p  pstrongHow do I handle the cases, when codestartAccessingSecurityScopedResourcecode call returns codeNOcode, stating about failure to obtain an accessstrongp  pSeems like when you try to codestartAccessingSecurityScopedResourcecode on an URL that is already being accessed you get the failure flag on return. Like, everything is OK, but you get an error flag. Seems like these startstop... calls have to be paired precisely, and even a balanced nesting is forbidden. strongSo, how to differentiate between the two possibilities when you get a codeNOcode on return a securityscoped URL that is already being accessed and a securityscoped URL that failed to resolvestrongp  pIt is an experimentallyproven fact, that your application can only access a finite amount of securityscoped URLs you can take about 1500 URLs before it will silently stop working. So, how should I properly relinquish access to the securityscoped URLs after Ive passed them to the QLPreviewPanel When it it a right time to do so It seems to me like it is a private implementation detail of a QLPreviewPanel class and I can make no assumptions about its internal workings.p

Negative 752 pIve been working on a COBOL grammar and found that the generated parser runs very slow for programs having deeply nested IF statements.p  pI think its better to look at a sample code first, to explain one of COBOLs annoying feature  one DOT full stop can close any level of unclosed nested IF statements. Here it isp  precodeIF condition1     S1     IF condition2         S2         more nested IF conditions            IF conditionn                Sn   0n ENDIFs  . codepre  pThe text between parenthesis are pseudo code. The key point is that the ENDIFs are optional before a DOT which closes a socalled sentence in COBOL. To allow the ENDIFs to be optional, Ive written the grammar this wayp  precodesentence   statementlist DOT    statementlist   statement    statement   ifstatement    ...   other statements    ifstatement   IF condition THEN statementlist   ELSE statementlist   ENDIF    codepre  pThis grammar turn out to be slow for the style of code like the sample above. When debugging I found the parser is busy predicting inside ifstatement. This is expected as there are ambiguities in the grammar. For the sample code, IF condition2 ... can be recognized as either a child or brother of IF condition1 ..., because there can be an omitted ENDIF right after S1. The inner most IF conditionn can have up to n choices. Similarly, every the ENDIF before the DOT have alternatives over the IF they pair with if their total number is not n.p  pI tried to cut off alternatives by adding semantic predicates, like belowp  precodestatementlist   statement  input.LA1ENDIF  input.LA1ELSE  input.LA1DOT      ifstatement   IF condition THEN statementlist     input.LA1ELSE  ELSE statementlist     input.LA1ENDIF  ENDIF      codepre  pThis reduced parse time of large programs by 23, but does not reduce it to be linear time, as deep prediction over ifstatement and statementlist is  still observed. A closer look into antlr 4 runtime seems to show that semantic predicates are not used at all during prediction.p  pDoes anyone know of a trick to make this optional ENDIF unambiguous, or make it predict fast p  pActually there is also ambiguity for the statements before ELSE, just like those before ENDIF.p  pNote Paring the sample with 30 levels of nested ELSEIF uses 3 seconds on my machine. And Im facing large programs that have many occurrence of such deep nesting and uses more than 10 minutes to parse. One of them even goes stack overflow when predicting.p  pAnother note Im using antlr 4.2.p

Negative 752 pAs part of my bachelor thesis, I will have to store a directional weighted graph. The graph itself will be partitioned into chunks and consist out of layers. A graph layer is considered as a subgraph with edges only pointing to vertices in the same chunk or in one chunk from the layer above.p  pThis may sounds a little bit confusing. Just imagine a quadtree based data structure. Every node is considered as a chunk. Two chunks are in the same layer if their distance to the root is the same.p  pI want to start now a bidirectional dijkstra search on two vertices from the lower level graphs. Conditionally new chunks beside the selected chunks will be loaded from memory. I do not know which chunk this will be. May I could give some heuristics but this does not matter for now.p  pFinally the question is how can I store these chunks efficient. Here I list some scenariosfeatures that shall be considered.p  ul lipsome data in a chunk may change. therefore chunks may get invalidated and recaluclated. changing a chunks data should be done with less effort. This can be done within the application from a binary format of a chunk.pli lipchunks may get used more often then others. this could be used to optimize loading and data availability.pli lipchunks beside each other should be indexed and easily be accessible.pli lipchunks beside each other loaded my be aligned in memory. I dont know really if this is possible, but i would like to increase locallity in memory to get better cache prefetching from my cpu.pli ul  pBased on the type of data structure I looked for document based databases. On the other hand postGIS gets more and more popular as well but since I do not need to search for invidual vertices I think this is not appropriate. A binary file based structure would also be possible.p  pIf you have further questions, please let me know. Thanks for your effort in advancep  pMichaelp

Im using a TemplateSelector to choose the correct DataTemplate according to a property on my class and thats working all great when I first create the list, the items are shown properly. However, when I change the property that sets the DataTemplate in runtime, the NotifyPropertyChanged is called and the information of the item is updated on the list, but not the DataTemplate.

I click on the item and the label changes to Y but the DataTemplate doesnt update.p  pAny idea on how I can do this Cant the DataTemplate be updated during runtime unless it is for the whole listp  pIll appreciate any help.p

Negative 752 pI have few doubts for consumer producer problem which I would like to discuss here with the community members. Please help me resolve my doubts. I have a class strongProduct.javastrong, strongProducer.javastrong, strongConsumer.javastrong and a strongQueue.javastrong. I have created the One instance of Queue.java, and same is  passed the same as constructor parameter to Object of Producer.java and Consumer.java where it is stored as volatile variable  strongprivate volatile Queue queuestrong . Queue is simple array based and does not take care of the synchronization itself. For my doubt I feel I need not put all the code here but I shall sharebr 1. produce defined in Producer.java, called in an while loop from run method.    p  precodepublic void produce throws InterruptedException      while queue.isFull          System.out.printlnProducer is reading the state of Queue...isFull    queue.isFull         synchronized queue              if queue.isFull                  System.out.println                         Producer waiting to consumer to consume items from the queue and queue become non full                 queue.wait                                synchronized queue          Product product  getProduct         System.out.println                 queue.toString   Producer has produced   product.getName    product.getSupply           queue.addproduct         queue.notifyAll       codepre  pand  2. consume defined in Consumer.java, called in an while loop from run method.p  precodepublic void consume throws InterruptedException     whilequeue.isEmpty         System.out.printlnConsumer is reading the state of Queue...isEmpty  queue.isEmpty         synchronizedqueue             ifqueue.isEmpty                 System.out.printlnConsumer is waiting for producer to produce items and put in queue and queue become non empty                 queue.wait                                synchronizedqueue         System.out.printqueue.toString         Product product  queue.remove         System.out.println     Consumer has  consumed the product   product.getName  with the supply of product.getSupply         queue.notifyAll       codepre  pBasically in both the methods there are two similar steps, for example in strongproducestrong methodbr strongStep 1strong Wait if the queue is full. For this I have used double check locking mechanism.br In a outer non synchronized block runs a while loop checking if the queue is full and then in a synchronized block again in an if statement queue is checked if it is full in case by the time current Producer thread acquired the lock, consumer thread would have consumed an item. If in synchronized block it finds queue to be filled then it waits. When it is notified by the Consumer that queue has space for more items as it has consumed items.br strongStep 2strong In a synchronized block produce an item and add it in the queue. Now release the lock and method execution is completed.p  pstrongBetween step 1 and step 2strong there is no synchronization and i feel it may happen that in step 1 Producer confirmed Queue to be not FULL and proceeded to add an item in the Queue, but what if by the time lock was acquired in step 2 another strongProducerstrong thread would have again made the queue full. In this case there would be an Exception for Queue Full. So now if in step 2 again I put a check for if Queue is not full then only produce the item, strongin this case one production would be loststrong. p  pIt feels Step 1 and Step 2 should be in some sort of cycle. Please help me understanding this concept. Similarly a consumption can either be lost if in consume similar exception is tried to handle. p  pRegardsp

Negative 752 pI have a problem on my web application regarding the buttons. Sometimes, in a non consistent way, the buttons clicking area does not match where the button is displayed on the screen.p  pWhen I look at the screen everything looks fine but when I put the mouse on the button, I dont get the pointer cursor, and if I click at this point on the button, nothing happens. Yet if I move the mouse below the button, the cursor turns into a pointer and I can then click there to trigger the button action.p  pWe have validated all of our HTML and dont have any issues left. At the moment, despite being in a complete mist, we consider that it might be the font we are using as it is loaded from FontDeck using the Google Fonts Library to load it.

Negative 752 pI am building an event registration app and storing the data in MongoDB. I have 3  collections that relate to each other via a foreign key and whenever one of the collections get updated, the rest need to get updated as well. Therefore, I was wondering if theres a pattern or method to easily keep track of all the collections that have to be updated or if theres a way for a collection to listen to when a dependent collection updates, and automatically update itself.p  pHeres a simplied examplep  pI have collections for Table, User, and Group. p  pTablep  precode   tableid   tablecount  codepre  pUserp  precode     userId,     tableid,     groupid     tablecount  codepre  pGroupp  precode     groupcount     tableid  codepre  pWhenever a User registers, I need to update the codetablecountcode and codegroupcountcode fields. Likewise, if a User changes tables or groups, the above fields will need to be updated as well. Even with only 3 collections, I need to write 6 update statements to consider all the possible user actions join table, leave table, etc.. So suppose an application had 10, 50, or 100 collections that all need to be updated whenever one of them updates, is there an efficient way to keep trackmake all the updatesp  pThanksp

So how does the compiler know to generate the closures Or is the compiler allowed to break in this situationp

Negative 752 pI am trying to UPDATE Table A with records in Table B based on a LEFT OUTER JOIN based on two columns of data. So, for example, the JOIN from Table A might be USA4 to match Table Bs USA4. Returning a result of XYZ to a different column. The problem I am having is the Table B contains multiple USA4s and as a result Table A appears to be updating more than once. Is there a way to fix this A different JOIN type p

I have looked at ExoPlayer and Protyposis but both have wordsconcepts that are way above my head words such as, TrackRenderer and ChunkSampleSource, to name two. Also, the Youtube API itself seems to have a few problematic requirements the device must have the Youtube app installed, and I must provide videoId as opposed to url of video.
