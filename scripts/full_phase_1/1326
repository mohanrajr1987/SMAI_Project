Positive 1326 pI am using Fabric.js with a rotation view port transformation applied on the canvas instance.  p  pWith the transform applied I am using free drawing mode to draw some paths on the canvas, the drawings being displayed with respect to the viewport transform.p  pAfter that I am trying to export the canvas to SVG, but in my SVG the object looks like it was not rotated at all. This is expected since the transformation was applied in the viewport when the drawing was made.p  pMy problem is that the position of the drawing is not respected, even though it has angle 0. p  pIt has some kind of an offset and is not in the position that I would expected to be if I would rotate it backwards from the original draw position.p  pHow can I preserve its position in the original canvas, regardless of the angle of rotation p

Positive 1326 pI have SVG images generated using the D3 library and they look great. Problem is, addSVG cant use them. I verified that regular SVGs work, I can do basic shapes, strokes, color fills. Is there a way to get the patterns in therep  pIdeally, could I extend addSVG to handle dataURIs or perhaps build a CSS with the pattern fillsp  pIf that doesnt work, then maybe a way to parse the SVG XML string to workp  pIf not either of those, is there a way to create some patterns in regular SVG that I could use instead Maybe theres an existing library thats simpler than D3 I actually dont need a lot.p  pedit Its worth mentioning that Node.js is not an option, and external server resources arent really an option either. Im saving an internal serverbased SVG to PNG converter to an absolute last fallback. Also typical clientside SVG to PNG conversions are a nogo as well, I have to support IE11 and I cant get around the security error canvas.toDataURL throws I dont think its possible.p

Positive 1326 pIm attempting to move from font icons icomoon.io to SVG sprites. strongIs it possible to use SVG sprites without needing lt svg  markup for each icon instancestrongp  pWhat I really liked about the font icons was that I didnt have to clutter my HTML with any additional elements to get the icon to display.

But if I save the same markup as an svg file and load that as an image it runs perfectly.p  precodevar svgText  ltxml version1.0gt     ltsvg xmlnshttpwww.w3.org2000svg xmlnsxlinkhttpwww.w3.org1999xlink  width239 height268 idtestSVG gt     ltdefsgt     ltlinearGradient idgrad2262398 x10 y10 x20 y21gt     ltstop offset0.0 stopcolorbcbbbbgt     ltstop offset1.0 stopcolord2a796gt     ltlinearGradientgt     ltdefsgt     ltpath dM 158.5 9.0 L 225.0 97.5 L 208.5 111.0 L 141.0 23.5 L 158.5 9.0 M 118.5 44.0 L 203.0 114.5 L 189.5 132.0 L 104.0 61.5 L 118.5 44.0 M 85.5 90.0 L 185.5 136.0 L 178.0 155.5 L 76.5 111.0 L 85.5 90.0 M 67.5 141.0 L 174.5 163.0 L 171.0 185.0 L 62.5 163.0 L 67.5 141.0 M 16.0 168.0 L 38.0 168.0 L 38.0 234.0 L 192.0 234.0 L 192.0 168.0 L 215.0 168.0 L 215.0 256.0 L 16.0 256.0 L 16.0 168.0 M 60.0 190.0 L 171.0 190.0 L 171.0 213.0 L 60.0 213.0 L 60.0 190.0   stylefillurlgrad2262398gt     ltsvggt var image  new Image image.src  svgText   this runs very slowly  while  var image  new Image image.src  svgText.svg  this renders as fast as a simillar sized bitmap image                             yet the content is exactly the same. codepre  pAbove is just an example of how the SVG is formated, the problem does not become an issue until the points in the path get to the several thousand.

Using properties from the backend is really neccessary.p  pThank you very much in advance  Cheers, CreaaZp

However user can click anywhere on the brush to create a new extent pair for the brush.

Negative 1326 pc  sql server I have to import a few tables from Access into sql server. The new sql server tables are already defined and created. The Access tables have primary key  foreign key relationships that have to be maintained. I would like to have the new sql tables use identity values for the primary keys, but I cant easily load the legacy rows and maintain the relationships if I do that. I could possibly load the data using identityinsert but I have to back way out of my ORM software subsonic to do that. Perhaps I can make my new primary keys nonidentity types, but then there is the hassle of generating unique ids for all the rows I add later. Im sure this has a decent solution out there somewhere.p

Negative 1326 pOver the years Ive worked on a number of microcontrollerbased projects mostly with Microchips PICs. Ive used various microcontroller simulators, and while they can be very helpful at times, I often find myself frustrated. In real life microcontrollers never exist alone and the firmwares behavior is dependent on the environment. However, none of the sims Ive used provide decent support for anything outside the microcontroller.p  pMy first thought was to model the entire board in Verilog. But, Id rather not create an entire CPU model, and I havent had much luck finding existing models for the chips I use. Regardless, I really dont need, or want, to simulate the proc at that level of detail, and Id like to retain the debugging facilities provided by a regular processor sim.p  pIt seems to me that the ideal solution would be a hybrid simulator that interfaces a traditional processor simulator with a Verilog model.p  pDoes such a thing existp

Negative 1326 pI would like to collect some bestpractices on deployment of a webapplication to a running Tomcat. Not long ago I had to describe the deployment process of our webapplication and the process appeared rather confusing.p  pSay, we have an application in a WAR file foo.war correctly configured and not requiring additional configuration. In this case, the deployment process is rather easyp  ul liCopy the foo.war file to the CATALINAHOMEwebapps directory. If the application starts correctly, the application will automatically deploy to CATALINAHOMEwebappsfoo directory.li ul  pTo undeploy the applicationp  ul liRemove the foo.war file from the CATALINAHOMEwebapps. If the application unloads correctly, it will be unloaded and the CATALINAHOMEwebappsfoo will be removed.li ul  pNow I want to override some context parameters in my running application. Having read the a hrefhttptomcat.apache.orgtomcat6.0docconfigcontext.htmldocsa, all I need to dop  ol liCreate a context.xml file called foo.xmlli liCopy the file to the CATALINABASEconf[enginename][hostname] directory.li ol  pUnfortunately, that did not work the application would not restart. Empirically, we found out that the only working solution is when the war file is deployed to a location outside the CATALINAHOMEwebapps. Besides, the default values of the configurable context parameters in the WAR file should be specified in the web.xml, since context.xml in the WAR file is not read when there is a context.xml outside.p  pHere is an easy example of the foo.xmlp  precodeltxml version1.0 encodingutf8gt                            ltContext docBasepathtodeploymentdirectoryfoo.wargt     ltParameter namemyparam valuenewvalue overridefalsegt ltContextgt codepre  pBe sure to specify overridefalse for the parameter if you want the newvalue to override the value specified in the WARs web.xml. This was not obvious for us.p  pThus, to deploy an aplication to a running Tomcatp  ol liCreate a context.xml file called foo.xmlli liCopy the file to the CATALINABASEconf[enginename][hostname] directory.li liCopy the foo.war to the location specified in the docBase of the foo.xml the application will deploy automatically.li ol  pTo apply new context parametersp  ul liAdd the parameter values to the foo.xml and save the file the application will redeploy automatically.li ul  pTo undeploy the applicationp  ul liRemove the foo.xml from the CATALINABASEconf[enginename][hostname] directoryli ul  pNote that removing the foo.war will also work, but will remove the foo.xml as well.p  phr p  pBy now, I have the following questionsp  ol liIs it a bestpractice at all to deploy a webapplication without stopping the tomcat I heard an opinion that deployment to a running tomcat is never needed since people run each application in a separate tomcat.li liIs it a good idea to copy WAR files to CATALINAHOMEwebapps or they should better be kept in a separate locationli liHow can I configure an application deployed to CATALINAHOMEwebappsli liWhy there is no INFO line in the catalina.out for deployment of an application and there is one for undeployment Is it configurableli ol
Negative 1326 pIve got a problemp  pI have a class A and a class B, whose instance objects can be inspected programatically to be similar or different from one another in varying amounts.  For instance they may match perfectly, or be quite different even though the classes are different, they can still represent the same information and be scored identical.p  pNow, given two collections, one of A, and one of B, what would be the best way to pair up the As and Bs in such a way that they are bestmatched leaving some orphans if either collection is larger than the other or if some of the As or Bs are simply too different to be matchedp  pMy first attempt was to create a 2dimensional array, where each cell was the score of the match 0  perfect, with larger numbers being worse and recursing through every path looking for the lowest accumulated score.  This works and the results are perfect, but it is hideously slow.p  pAny ideas on more efficient algorithmsp  pIn case you are wondering, my A class represents an audio mixer input channel, and my B represents the persisted state of the same called a scene.

Negative 1326 pBackground Our web app uses the jquery.constrain.js plugin to handle data entry in some text boxes, to only allow valid characters to be added.  This plugin allows various constraints upon the data, using regular expressions, whitelistblacklist characters, etc.  Until today, we were running the 1.0 release of this plugin, unmodified.p  pI noticed a few days ago that some of the text boxes still allowed invalid data entry.  For example, a numericonly textbox allowed alpha characters, etc.  It also displayed a javascript error Object doesnt support this property or method.  I tracked it down to the following function in the jquery.constrain plugin.p  precode    function matchitem, input, e          var arr  item.chars.split         for var i in arr              var token  arr[i]             if token.charCodeAt0  e.which                  return true                               if item.regex              var re  new RegExpitem.regex             if re.testString.fromCharCodee.which                  return true                                return false      codepre  pDebugging through this block of code, I determined the followingp  ul liemitemem is an object with two string properties emcharsem and emregexemli liemitem.charsem is an empty string  at the time of failure.li liemarrem, the result of emitem.chars.splitem is, as expected, an empty array.li ul  pHeres where its weird.  Even though emarrem is an empty array, the for loop assigns a valid value to emiem.  The value is remove.  So we drop into the loop.  emtokenem is obviously null, because arr[remove] is null.  So emtoken.charCodeAt0em throws.p  pI corrected the error by adding an if statement around the for loop, as followsp  precode        if arr.length gt 0              for var i in arr                  var token  arr[i]                 if token.charCodeAt0  e.which                      return true                                        codepre  pHowever, Im completely baffled as to why this was even emnecessaryem  is this an IE bug, a bug in the plugin, or am I just holding my breath wrong when I compile the appp

Negative 1326 pIm attempting to split up my WCF web services into a few services instead of 1 giant service.  But the Visual Studio Silverlight client duplicates the common classes shared by both services.  Here is a simple example to illustrate my problem.p  pIn this example there are two services.  Both return the type Person.  By default VS will create two seperate Person proxys under unique NameSpaces.  This means that the Person returned by the different services cannot be consumed by the client as the same thing.

The ViewModels provide a nice interface for WPF databinding.  Thats the reason for the wrapper classesp  pSince the infinite loop is in the constructor and its trying to create new objects, I cant just set a boolean flag to prevent this because neither object ever gets finished being constructed.  p  pWhat Im thinking is having either as a singleton or passed in to the constructor or both a codeDictionaryltRecipe, RecipeViewModelgtcode and codeDictionaryltCategory, CategoryViewModelgtcode that will lazyload the view models, but not create a new one if one already exists, but I havent gotten around to trying to see if itll work since its getting late and Im kinda tired of dealing with this for the past 6 hours or so.p  pNo guarantee the code here will compile since I took a bunch of stuff out that was unrelated to the problem at hand.p

Negative 1326 pI have a UserControl that adds a CommandBinding to its CommandBindings collection to handle a specific Command. Later I use this control in a window and want to add another binding to that same control to add additional behavior. The problem though, is that when I do this it seems that when I add another CommandBinding to the CommandBindings collection of a control that it replaces any binding that was already made for the same Command. So what it seems like is that a control can only have a single CommandBinding per control, is this correctp  pPlease see the code example below which attempts to set two CommandBindings for the same Save Command.p  precodeltWindow xClassMultipleCommandBindings.Window1 xmlnshttpschemas.microsoft.comwinfx2006xamlpresentation xmlnsxhttpschemas.microsoft.comwinfx2006xaml TitleWindow1 Height300 Width300gt ltWindow.CommandBindingsgt     ltCommandBinding CommandSave                     ExecutedCommandBindingExecuted gt     ltCommandBinding CommandSave                     ExecutedCommandBindingExecuted gt ltWindow.CommandBindingsgt ltGridgt     ltButton Height23             HorizontalAlignmentRight             Margin0,0,25,88             Namebutton1             VerticalAlignmentBottom             Width75             CommandSavegtButtonltButtongt ltGridgt codepre  pp  pOriginally I was expecting either a compiletime or runtime exception when wrote this code but was surprised that it didnt complain. Next though I was disappointed since my CommandBindingExecuted handler only gets called once instead of twice as I was hoping.p  pstrongUpdatestrong After a bit of testing it appears that my second CommandBinding is not overwriting my first one but instead it appears that even though Im not setting Handled to true in my event handler that the first command binding swallows up the Command. Im pretty sure at this point that the solution to my problem is to understand why the routed command is not propagating past the first handler even when Handled is not set to true.p  pstrongUpdatestrong  Ive found a hrefhttpwww.wpfwiki.comWPF20Q13.9.ashxthis great little tidbita of information which just confirms some of the strange behavior behind Command routing in WPF.p  pstrongUpdatestrong  One thought about how to work around the fact that it appears that there can only be a single effective CommandBinding per command is that it appears that the default CommandBinding class exposes Executed and CanExecute as events which of course like all events can have multiple handlers. The idea then is to have some other way than the standard CommandBindings.Add method to add additional handlers to a command. Maybe this could be done via an extension method on the Control class and conjunction with a custom CompositeCommandBinding class which allows us to aggregate multiple bindings within one main binding.p

Negative 1326 pOk, this may sound a little unorthodox, but...using VS2010 and the new POCO t4 template for Entity Framework a hrefhttpblogs.msdn.combadonetarchive20100125walkthroughpocotemplatefortheentityframework.aspx relnofollowWalkthrough POCO Template for the Entity Frameworka, I can generate nice POCOs. I can then use these POCOs as DTOs in a WCF service essentially going from EDM all the way through to the client. Kinda what this guys is doing a hrefhttpdevblog.petrellyn.comtagentityframework40 relnofollowPOCO with EF 4.0 and WCF 4.0a, except everything is generated automatically. I understand that an entity and a DTO should be different, but in this case, Im handling client and server, and theres some real advantages to having the DTO in the model and automatically generated. p  pMy problem is, that when I transfer an entity that has a relationship, the client generated collection ICollection has the readonly value set, so I cant manipulate that relationship. For example, retrieving an existing Order, I cant add a product to the Products collection clientside...the Products collection is readonly. p  pI would prefer to do a bunch of client side orderediting and then send the updated order back rather than making dozens of server round trips eg AddProductToOrderproduct. Id also prefer not to have a bunch of thunking between Entity and DTO. So allinall this looks good to me...except for the readonly part.p  pIs there a solution, or is this too much against the SOA grainp
Negative 1326 pIm currently developing a simple application that displays map and draws some markers on it. Im developing for Windows Mobile, so I decided to use DirectDraw and Imaging interfaces to make the application fast and pretty. The map moves when user moves finger on the touchscreen, so the whole map movingscrolling animation has to be fast, but it is not. p  pOn every map update I have to draw portion of the map, control buttons, and markers  buttons and markers are preloaded on DirectDraw surface as a mipmap. So the only thing I do is BitBlit from the mipmap to a back buffer, and from the back buffer to a primary surface I cant use page flipping due to the windowed mode of my application. p  pPreviously I used premultipliedalpha surface with 32 bit ARGB pixel format for images mipmap, everything was looking good, but drawing entire scene was horribly slow  i could forget about smooth map scrolling. Now Im using mipmap with native RGB565 pixel format and fuchsia 0xFF00FF color key. Drawing is much better. p  pMy mipmap surface is generated on program loading  images are loaded from files, scaled with filtering and drawn on mipmap. The problem is, that image scaling process blends pixel colors, and those pixels which are on the border of a sprite region are blended with surrounding fuchsia pixels resulting semifuchsia color that is not treated as color key. When I do blitting with color key option, sprites have small fuchsialike borders, and it looks really bad. p  pHow to solve this problem I can use alpha blitting, but it is too slow  even in ARGB 1555 format.  p

Other browsers trigger both events so its not a problem for them.p  pThe obvious solutionhack to me at least is to attach a dblclick handler in IE that triggers my click handler twice.

Negative 1326 pIm developing a project management application in Django that requires a somewhat linear response process involving different groups of users as in Django auth Groups.  Each step in the response process has several response options most options unique to the step and is assigned to a user within a particular group.  The next step in the process is determined by the users response, and occasionally additional information may need to be requested from one of the projects members.p  pThe problem is that my current implementation seems rather cumbersome and I am certain there is a better way to keep track of the response process.  I was hoping someone could provide some insight into a more robust solution.p  pAs a simple example, consider a Project with the following user Groups Sales Rep, Sales Manager, and Project Manager. The models currently looks like thisp  precodeclass Projectmodels.Model       assignedto  models.ForeignKeyUser, relatednameprojectsassignedto Indicates which user needs to respond next.  Will be salesrep, salesmgr, or projectmgr.     salesrep  models.ForeignKeyUser, relatednamesalesrepprojects choices limited to Sales Rep Group       salesmgr  models.ForeignKeyUser, relatednamesalesmgrprojects choices limited to Sales Manager Group      projectmgr  models.ForeignKeyUser, relatednameprojectmgrprojects choices limited to Project Manager Group     currentstep  models.ForeignKeyStep, relatednameprojectswithcurrentstep     previousstep  models.ForeignKeyStep, relatednameprojectswithpreviousstep     status  models.ForeignKeyStatus Automatically assigned according to the users response.  Includes things like On Track, On Hold, Rejected, Accepted, etc.  class Stepmodels.Model     name  models.CharFieldmaxlength50   class Statusmodels.Model     name  models.CharFieldmaxlength50  codepre  pHeres a simple overview of how the process might workp  ol liSales Rep creates a new project and it is assigned to Sales Managerli liSales Manager is presented with the following optionsbr a approve the project orbr b request more information from the Sales Rep  li liIf the project is approved, assign to Project Manager who is presented with the following optionsbr a commence the projectbr b reject the projectbr c request more information from the Sales Rep or Sales Manager  li liIf more information is requested from a user, the project is assigned to that user and they just need to provide a textbox response.  However, once their response has been received, the project needs to return to the previous step this is why I keep track of currentstep and previousstep above.  In this example, if Project Manager requests more information from the Sales Rep, once the Sales Rep responds the project should be assigned back to the Project Manager with the same response options that he had before commence, reject, request more information.li ol  pThe full process has about 10 or so steps like these.p  pTo complicate things, I also need to be able to display the response chosen for each step.  For example, if the Sales Manager approves the project, it should display Sales Manager approved the project along with any comments they may have.  The model looks like thisp  precodeclass Responsemodels.Model     comment  models.TextField     responseaction  models.ForeignKeyResponseAction     submitted  models.DateTimeField  class ResponseActionmodels.Model       I.e. Sales Manager approved the project, Project Manager commenced the project        name  models.CharFieldmaxlength100 codepre  pRight now the logic for each response action is hard coded in the view, and theres no formal relationship between one step and another.  I feel like theres a better model structure or data structure I should be using to keep track of this workflow, but Ive been working with the current system for so long that Im having trouble thinking about it differently. Any insight or inspiration would be greatly appreciated  Let me know if I need to clarify anything.p

Negative 1326 pDoes somebody tested Code OnTime on a real world project codeontime.com Technology looks promising, but their free version restrictions are too restrictive. I managed to put only few tables in a model, real DB has 20tables. Also it is not clear how generated site works where DB contains lot of records. To my surprise I didnt find any reviews or blog posts on this topic. I consider to buy a license, but Im in doubts.p  pIf not Code OnTime, are there any other decent code generator All I need is front end to DB and simple security.p  pThank you, Alexp
Negative 1326 pThis is a trivial programming question. I am not an expert in Java. Say I use objects of custom classes Company and Employee, in a manner similar to what many RDBMS examples dop  precodeclass Employee      Company company   class Company      String name  codepre  pI need to guarantee that different codeCompanycode objects have unique names  i.e. no two such objects may have the same name, because from my point of view it makes no sense, and also simply eats memory  if two employees work at IBM, then there is a single codeCompanycode object with that codenamecode, period. p  pMy thoughts right now go along of making codeCompanycode constructor private  so that the job of allocating Company objects with arbitrary names is delegated to a trusted method  which, suppose, will reject any subsequent attempt to create an object with a name that already exists or return an existing or new object creating one if necessary.p  pThe problem is, I am not sure how to accomplish this elegantly. One thing that would be nice is not having to do a codeOncode lookup every time an codeCompanycode object with a name is requested  so maybe a hash map or a binary tree is there for my convenience I would also like to override the way the codeCompanycode objects are identified  which leads me to this will I be overriding codeObject.equalscode andor codeObject.hashCodecode methodsp

Negative 1326 pI have what i thought was a simple javascript  jquery function fade out of one div, fade into another... loop until it reaches a maximum and then start back from the begining. The problem i have though is that to fadein the next div i need to increment the global counter. Doing this increments double increments it because im assuming the local variable ive created maintains the same reference to the global variable. p  pThe code sample below should explain a little easier.

Negative 1326 pIm using CakePHP 1.3.2 with jQuery 1.4.2 and Im seeing some strange behaviour with AJAX requests.p  pIntermittently, when clicking an AJAX pagination link Ill see 2 POST requests instead of 1, the first of which is via XMLHttpRequest, the second of which isnt. The first request never completes, but returns a full page using the default.ctp layout. The second request completes with a 200 OK response and also returns a full page wrapped in default.ctpp  pThe HTML returned never gets displayed in the div it should be showing in and just hangs.p  pThe above intermittent behaviour also happens with Ajaxy an ajax framework so it doesnt seem to be down to the javascript being used.p  pI read somewhere that CakePHP always responds with the default layout if theres an error, but theres no error message returned with debug set to 2 in core.phpp  pAfter this issue, If I click on any other AJAX links they dont respond with new content. The entire page needs to be refreshed before AJAX links work again and they return content without the default.ctp layout.p  pcontrollerp  precodeltphp class UsersController extends AppController

Negative 1326 pI am somewhat of a novice and am seeking some help.p  pI am working in Visual Studios 2010 and have my solution that has my project that I am currently working on. Specifically I am working on a Win32 Project. I dont know if that is important to know or not.p  pI have made a filefolder structure in the directory I am working on to help organize my sources. I would like to mimic that in the project but cant. After organizing my sources it says that some cant be found when I compile. I have alleviated some of the problem by editing some of the include statements but there are still some I cant fix as they need to include a file from one folder higher I guess the parent folder and I dont know how to do that in an include statement.p  pIs there anyway I can have actual physical folders in my project that mimic my structure If so will it handle the includes fine IE if I say include BaseClass.h and its in the folder one higher again I guess parent folder will it find it.p  pIve tried dragging my filesfolders over from the solution explorer but it just adds them. I have also tried to use the Add New Filter it has a folder icon and it does indeed create a folder in the project but they arent physical folders. They are just there to help organize the files in the Solution Explorer for the project.p  pIve tried Google searchingp  pcreate folder visual studio 2010 project add folder visual studio 2010 project create file structure visual studio 2010 projectp  pAnd they just direct me to drag over the folders from my Solution Explorer and again they dont actually add the folders. They do speak of a template but I dont know if thats what I need to do. I am not technically skilled enough yet to understand it all so would need to do more research. Any pointershelp would be much appreciated.p

Does it means that it void all the cached values for that variable in all CPUspli lipAre you using a memory barrier when you use the keyword volatilepli lipInterloked performs a readmodifywrite in an atomic operation.

Can prefuse code be manipulated to display parallel edges  Since this involves basic data level changes I believe this would be more difficult that the usual customized rendering changes.p  p2 I didnt find any reference to combined graph both directed and undirected edges in both prefuse and JUNG.

How does each framework perform while redrawing the graph  I saw in another post that prefuse does not perform well for dynamic updates a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions502763prefusetoolkitdynamicallyaddingnodesandedgesPrefuse Toolkit dynamically adding nodes and edgesa p  p6 This comes down to modifying the graph and redrawing it. So the question becomes the same as 5p  p7 Both JUNG and prefuse has multiple layout algorithms. But When I tried to display the same dataset using FruchtermanReingoldLayout in both JUNG and Prefuse I get different displays. Any ideas why  Somehow the layout algorithms in Prefuse seem to display a better layout than in JUNG rendering is also better I think though most of the layout algorithms in Prefuse are based on JUNG implementation.  Prefuse layouts such as ForceDirectedLayoutFruchtermanReingoldLayout and CircleLayout directly maps to star,circle, mesh topologies.p  pOutside of these requirements, prefuse has good support for expressions and query language but looks like it is not actively developed unlike JUNG. which one has better visualization Any suggestions on which one will be suitable and how to overcome the shortcomings    p  pAny other frameworks out there which I can use  p

Negative 1326 pTo be more specific for my application the shared data are mostly persistent data such as monitoring status, configurations  not more than few hundreds of items, and are updated and read frequently but no more than 1 or 2Hz. The processes are local to each other on the same machine.p  pEDIT 1 more info  Processes are expected to poll on a set of data they are interested in ie. monitoring Most of the data are persistent during the lifetime of the program but some eg. configs are required to be restored after software restart. Data are updated by the owner only assume one owner for each data Number of processes are small too not more than 10p  pAlthough using a database is notably more reliable and scalable, it always seems to me it is kind of an overkill or too heavy to use when all I do with it is to share data within an application. Whereas message passing with eg. JMS also has the middleware part, but it is more lightweight and has a more natural or flexible communication API. Implementing event notification and command pattern is also easier with messaging I think.p  pIt will be of great help if anyone can give me an example of what circumstance would one be more preferable to the other.p  pFor example I know we can more readily share persistent data between processes using database, although it is also doable with messaging by distributing across processes andor storing with some XML files.p  pAnd according to here, a hrefhttpen.wikipedia.orgwikiDatabaseasIPC relnofollowhttpen.wikipedia.orgwikiDatabaseasIPCa and here, a hrefhttptripatlas.comDatabaseasanIPC relnofollowhttptripatlas.comDatabaseasanIPCa. It says itd be an anti pattern when used in place of message passing, but it does not elaborate on eg. how bad can the performance hit be using database compared to message passing.p  pI have gone thru several previous posts that asked a similar question but I am hoping to find an answer thatd focus on design justification. But from those questions that I have read so far I can see a lot of people did use database for IPC or implemented message queue with databasep  pThanksp

Negative 1326 pI have an application that has database records that correspond to a city, or a country.  My User model has the fields cityid and countryid.  If cityid is not zero, the user should just have access to records that correspond to that city.  There are about 8 other models with the foreign key cityid, for example, Post, Advert, Venue, Competition...p  pI am setting up Acl and I would like to know if theres a good way to deny access to records that dont have the same cityid as the authenticated user, unless the authenticated user has a cityid of 0 which means they have access to every city.  The same goes to country, I have the field countryid which serves the same purpose.p  pGuidance would be very much appreciated, before I go and do soemthing really hacky and horrible, thanks.p

Negative 1326 pI am working on a new liferay implementation.  I have all of my users in an external system, and have used the external env. to authenticate through my own authentication system.  I also store roles in this same system.  I have been able to successfully pass these to liferay so that all of my users roles are available in liferay.  p  pI would like to create an organization or community that is associated with a role.  For example if I have a role called myusers in my external system, I would like to tie that role to an organization or community in liferay.  Then when a user logged in to liferay with that role, they would be able to be part of that organization or community.  Is this possible in liferay  I know its kind of backwards to the normal flow in liferay of adding roles to users and then adding user to a community or organization.p

Negative 1326 pI wrote a script to read a list of folder objects into an xml file showing the properties for the folder.  It also creates another xml file at a later point in time.  After the delta xml file is created, I import both xml files and compare them based on the folder name to display which folders have been deleted or removed and save the results in html format to a file for viewing.  Everything works well, but I want to replace some of the values in the results.  The icompareobjecti cmdlet lets me display some attributes, but tells what side the change was on by putting  for a folder added in the delta file or lt for a folder removed in the delta file.  I really would like to replace the column name of SideIndicator and the replace the  or lt values with something more intuitive.  I played around with useing Replace  original, newvalue type method. I found guidance on Hey Scripting Guy blog and some other examples around, but none seemed to do what I want.  What is the best way to approach this  Currently Im not storing the compared results, just formatting and converting to HTML.  Any advice is appreciated.  I can post the code if needed, but it is about 60 lines long and Im really looking for the best way to accomplish this, not neccesarily someone to write the code.p  pThanksp

Negative 1326 pI am learning Haskell and trying to understand Monads. I have 2 questions.p  pFrom what I understand, Monad is just another typeclass that declares ways to interact with data inside containers, including Maybes, Lists, and IOs. It seems clever and clean to implement these 3 things with one concept, but really, the point is so there can be clean error handling in a chain of functions, containers, and side effects. Is this a correct interpretationp  pSecondly, how exactly is the problem of sideeffects solved With this concept of containers, the language essentially says anything inside the containers is nondeterministic such as io. Because lists and IOs are both containers, lists are equivalenceclassed with IO, even though values inside lists seem pretty deterministic to me. So what is deterministic and what has sideeffects I cant wrap my head around the idea that a basic value is deterministic, until you stick it in a container which is no special than the same value with some other values next to it, e.g. Nothing and it can now be random.p  pCan someone explain how, intuitively, Haskell gets away with changing state with inputs and output Im not seeing the magic here.p

Negative 1326 pI think I understand that you can only retrieve the size of an array using sizeof if it is declared at compile time on the stack, e.g.p  precodeint myarray[]  1,2,3 sizeofmyarray  3 codepre  pAs soon as you start using pointers you lose this length information.p  pe.g. if you pass a pointer to int as a function parameter to get an int array into a function you can no longer use codesizeofcode in this way, it will just return the number of bytes used to store a pointer.p  pClearly, it is vital to know how long your arrays are.p  pSo which of the following options should I use when passing arrays aroundp  ol lipPass a pointer and an accompanying length parameter p  pcodeint myfuncint myarray, sizet lenmyarraycodepli lipCreate my own vector structp  precodestruct vector     int myarray    sizet len   int myfuncstruct vector myvector codepreli lipUse someone elses vector implementation.

Negative 1326 pI am doing a project which deals with large amount of data. I am thinking to host that project on Ec2. I intend to use Hadoop to do the computing and some NoSql system e.g. HbaseCassandra to store the data. The NoSql system must be persistent I dont want to lose my data.

My client side programming is a bit rusty though and Im having issues with the actual streaming. I would assume this is not an uncommon task. Anyone got a decent solution for it in ASP.NET MVCp  pBiggest issue seems to be that I cant get the StandardOutput until the end of execution, but I was able to get it with an event handler.

Negative 1326 pJust for practice and not as a homework assignment I have been trying to solve this problem CLRS, 3rd edition, exercise 11.26p  blockquote   pSuppose we have stored n keys in a hash table of size m, with   collisions resolved by chaining, and that we know the length of each   chain, including the length L of the longest chain. Describe a   procedure that selects a key uniformly at random from among the keys   in the hash table and returns it in expected time OL  1  mn.p blockquote  pWhat I thought so far is that the probability of each key being returned is 1n. If we try to get a random value x between 1 to n, and try to find the xth key in sequence first sorted by bucket then along the chain in the bucket, then it will take Om to find the right bucket by going through buckets one by one and OL time to get the right key in chain.p

Negative 1326 pI develop a Win32 application in Visual Studio 2008 C. It runs fine in either 32bit or 64bit Windows 7.

By big memory buffers I mean one 250MB and another 150MB. I have 8GB RAM installed in my PC, and according to my information, the 64bit OS makes 4GB availabla for a 32bit application.

Negative 1326 pI am trying to write a program that changes the default gateway of network time by time. But it seems that there are caches on the route table in every process so that I cannot control the network behavior accurately. Can I just flush route table to that processp  pFor example if I executed an Iexplore.exe first, then changed the default gateway to a Korean vpn, IE still went to amercia default gateway. But if I change the default gateway first and then execute Iexplore.exe, it went to Korea.p  pSo how can I flush the route table cache Thanks.p

Negative 1326 pPHP  MVC question  So this is a pretty high level question about building an MVC. I have a class called page, and it needs to pull in classes for the model, view, and controller. There is also a Route class that has mostly attributes regarding the Path ClassMethodarg1arg2 , etc p  pRight now the Page pulls in that Route object as its constructor param. p  pShould Model, View and Controller extend Page  Whihle M,V,ampC need certain information from the Route object, I dont think that logically a Model for instance extends a Page  because while its a part of a page, its not a different kind of page, and Im not sure the M,V, amp C need to be that intimate with each other. p  pBut I thought Id ask anyway. What Im finding myself doing is the Page will pass that Route object to the controller when it instantiates it, then the same with the Model, View, etc. p  pI know every time you find yourself doing redundant things like this, it might be time to step back and rethink before you do too much work down that path. p  pBut again, in my mind, the M,V, amp C are not forms of a page, its more a composition thing. p  pThoughts p  pThanksp

Negative 1326 pI am using MVC 4 and the MVC Futures code[Serializable]code feature to persist data through a multistep wizard. The wizard itself is just collecting info from the user and then generating an automated response based on those inputs. I have no need to permanently store the inputs into a DB.p  pNow, Ive run into a bit of a problem that I can handle on the Confirm page of the wizard, but I am wondering if I can obviate the need to do that. My problem is that if a user hits RefreshF5 and you know they will all their inputs on a particular step and all prior steps are erased. If they are on the final step before confirmation they will not realize they have cleared everything they input on prior steps. The way to handle that is to put a validation summary on the confirmation page which will then show that every input needs to be redone. This presents a problem because it destroys the user experience they have to go back through all the steps and reinput.p  pHere is a sample of my controller codep  precodeThis is the serialization private MyData myData     protected override void OnActionExecutingActionExecutingContext filterContext              var serialized  Request.Form[myData]         if serialized  null Form was posted containing serialized data                      myData  MyDatanew MvcSerializer.Deserializeserialized, SerializationMode.Signed             TryUpdateModelmyData                  else             myData  MyDataTempData[myData]  new MyData          protected override void OnResultExecutedResultExecutedContext filterContext              if filterContext.Result is RedirectToRouteResult             TempData[myData]  myData      ...

I dont know if thats on point, but it makes sense that a page refresh would cause all the data entered to disappear in this situation because the model is not being hit until the end.

Negative 1326 pI have been using oscmex httpsourceforge.netprojectsoscmex to receive Open Sound Control messages in Matlab r2007b from a Kinect via OSCeleton httpsgithub.comSensebloomOSCeleton for a while now. It was working on a Windows XP computer with Matlab 32bit.p  pI am now trying to get it to work on a Windows 7 computer with no luck. I installed a 32bit version of Matlab and added the .dll binaries, but all I can receive are empty OSC packets. I have searched forums high and low without finding a solution.  I know that OSC messages are streaming from the Kinect, because OSCeleton sees the calibration pose and I can see changing variable values in GlovePIE httpssites.google.comsitecarlkennerglovepie.p  pMy question is, then, is there an easier way to receive OSC messages in Matlab I found the script to send OSC messages httpwww.mathworks.commatlabcentralfileexchange31400sendopensoundcontroloscmessages but havent found one to receive. Any suggestions as to why the osc .dll files wont work on a 32bit version of Matlab running on a 64bit system  Would compiling the oscmex sources against 64bit Matlab work, and could someone help me do that  There is clearly a disconnect between the OSC client OSCeleton and the OSC server Matlab, but I cant figure out what it is.p  pThanks in advancep  pMattp

Negative 1326 pI implementing an algorithm to solve the NPuzzle problem. This algorithm will use other algorithms like A and an Heuristic Bidirectional Search. In general this both algorithms give to me good results A worked finding solution for some problems with more that 50 moves, and i use the other for the other larger solutions.p  pThe problem is the follow i am using Manhattan Distance as heuristic for both algorithms and seem to work perfectly if the board has no repeated tiles. For example for 3x3 a classic 8puzzle start board could be 1,2,34,5,67,8,0, with repeat tiles could be 1,1,12,3,21,1,0. But in this case when the board has repeated tiles these algorithm works, but is not the same, and take even more time and give larger solutions. I modified the heuristic function and now each tile take the shortest path to any original position, for example if are several 2 each one will calculate the Manhattan distance to its nearest start position that have a 2. p  pQuestions Any knows any better heuristic for these problems Is this Manhattan Distance Heuristic still admissible for the problem with repeated elements Is this another problem different from NPuzzlep  pThanks...p

Negative 1326 pI am seeking help from SOAESB experts on some architectural design. Apologies if the question isnt very clear.p  pWe have several business cases where we are currently using P2P communications or loads of blocks of code like p  precode       if...                Update System 1                Then Update System 2                Then Update System 3        Else If ...                 Update System 1 in a different Way                  Dont Update 2 at all                  Update 3 but differently codepre  pNow there is lot of boiler plate code and Database update code all over. Fun is we started off with one client facing interface and then kept on adding more and to gain quick wins kept on replicating the code all over. Now when a small change was required it became a humongous task.p  pThis was a typical ESB type case IMHO and we are thinking of embracing Topic  Publish  Subscribe model to cater to such scenarios. So that all participating clients can publish a message to a Topic and then we simply hook on subscribers wherever and whenever needed. Al the Db or system update code will be generic and goes to a single clustered deployment.p  pHowever say the data should be updated in all systems. e.g. if an update in 1 subscriber fails we should rollback the update in other systems or at least maintain an audit where it failed. What is the best approach to achieve the above Are there standard tools utilities we can usep  pFYI  We are using Java technologies and Mule ESB and want to utilise its full potential. Thanks in advance. Please do let me know if more clarity is neededp

Negative 1326 pIve always been intrigued by DreamWeaver, particularly the ability to click on something and edit its CSS right there so I dont have to find it in my huge list of CSS.  However, I use a pretty complex homemade MVC framework for my coding that loads and creates pages through a series of includes, classes, function calls, etc.  Quite a while ago, I tried a little to get Dreamweaver to even load a page but gave up pretty quickly.  It wouldnt even display a single thing.  I didnt try anything special though to get it to work like messing in the settings though.  p  pI was wondering if DreamWeaver can handle something like this at this point and if so, what version would I need and how can I find out how to do it  If not, does anyone know of a good visual IDE where I can edit CSS just by clicking on something that would also support a complex PHP MVC framework page loading processp

Negative 1326 h2In shorth2  pIs it possible set up an RServer that can handledispatch multiple client requests in an strongasynchronousstrong way p  pI guess Im looking for some sort of socket communication. Or is there something even more efficient to let R talk to other applications p  pNow, I dont really care if the communication is eventually realized via plainvanilla socket communication something like codesocketConnectionport6011, serverTRUEcode for the server process, codesocketConnectionhostSys.info[nodename], port6011code for client processes in combination with codewriteLinescode and codereadLinescode of JSON characterstrings or something more advanced like using web server facilities based on HTTP requests.p  h2More detailsh2  pFirst of My background with respect to those nittygritty informatics details is all DIY, so things like emsocket communicationem, details about emmasterserver conceptsem or emasynchronous communicationem etc. are pretty new to me. So please dont bite p  pId like one of my processes to act as an RServer. AFAIU, R was not designed under a multithreadingparadigm. So I wonder how I can make my RServer handle concurrent client requests currently coming from a third party software that sends its requestsobjects via JSONstyle character strings in an strongasynchronousstrong way.p  pIn plain english I would like to tell my server process something like thisp  blockquote   blockquote     pOnce you get an incoming message at port xy, do what you need to do but emimmediatelyem switch back to responsive mode to be able to handle the next client request and always take care that each client gets the results that is logically linked to its respective request.p   blockquote blockquote  h2Homeworkh2  pI started out with something very basicp  precodecon lt socketConnectionportas.numericport, serverTRUE codepre  pThis would make my R process become a server. It works a treat, but since codeconcode is my only connection object, the server is doomed to handle each client request sequentially p  blockquote   blockquote     pRead the input from the connection, do some calculations, write output back to the connection and only strongthenstrong handle the next client request.p   blockquote blockquote  pI thought about have my server process immediately dispatch everything that needs to be done to an strongauxiliary Rscript processstrong so that the main server process is ready to take the next request. But since at the end of the day the results need to pass through codeconcode again in my main server process, I think that doesnt really get me any points as the server process still needs to wait until the auxiliary process is finished before taking the next request. Or can I tell this auxiliary process to directly report back to the client request somehowp  pEven though Im currently not aiming at turning my server into a fullgrown web server, these sophisticated web server approaches seemed very promising to me at a first glancep  ul lia hrefhttpwww.rforge.netRserve relnofollowRServea a hrefhttpcran.rproject.orgwebpackagesRserveindex.html relnofollowCRAN pageali lia hrefhttpjeffreyhorner.tumblr.compost25035081768rooktutorialatuser2012 relnofollowRooka a hrefhttpcran.rproject.orgwebpackagesRookindex.html relnofollowCRAN pageali ul  pIs asynchronous clientcommunication possible with one of thesep  pAny pointer whatsoever will be stronggreatlystrong appreciatedp  hr  h2EDITh2  pstrongIll offer a bounty of 300 credits once the question is eligible.strongp

Negative 1326 pI am trying to import a table from an old database MS Access to MySQL server using CRBatchMove using Delphi 2007. p  pThe program fetches data from the legacy database over an ODBC connection and stores it on the local hard drive using TADOTable.SaveToFile. The second part of the program reads this file into another TADOTable and uses TCRBatchMove to transfer it to a MySQL server via DevArts TMyTable. In this process the batch move appears to be extremely slow for some reason.p  pAmount of data in the following trial is about 100,000 records each with about 120 fields. Most of the fields are integers and VARCHAR each of VARCHAR less than 32 chars.p  pThe performance figures I obtained arep  precodeTime taken to bring data to local file over ODBC connection 17 seconds Time taken to load data from local file into TADOTable 3 seconds Time taken by TCRBatchMove to move data from TADOTable to TMyTable gt 30 minutes codepre  pMySQL server is running locally on the development machine which is an i72.8GHz and the database is otherwise very snappy.p  pWhy is it so slow for the batch move to push data to MySQL server. Is there a way to speed up this task Or is there a better way to accomplish thisp

Negative 1326 pWhen we are running our build through MSBuild, what context does the MSBuild run inunderp  pThe reason I am asking is because I have prebuild event that calls a command line program ajax minification that works perfectly if the project is build through VS2010 on the same machine, but does not work when our build system CCNet is building it. The error i get is 9009, which means that its cant find the file. The command line program has a environment path set for its location environment path is set through setx, maybe its only set for current user, so calling only its name works perfectly in all cases other then when CCNet calls MSBuild. p

Negative 1326 pHi I came here because I know that I will be getting very positive suggestions from this forum. I recently come to know that I need to have a developer account to debug and release my windows store app. I have developed an app using windows phone and windows 8. But now I am planning to buy a windows phone like Lumia 920 to test my app in real device. There may be bugs or unhandled exception so I want to test that. Till now I am testing using my laptop.  p  pBut I come to know that to test that app I need to have a developer account Cost approx. 5500 INR to unlock the phone for testing. This is something uncalled for from Microsoft. I dont mind to pay  that amount when my app will be in windows store, but why at the time of debugging and testing p  pI was in android developer once and Google doesnt charge anything until you release your app in App Market. p  pDoes anybody of you having any idea how can I test my app without developer account Or any other suggestions if you want to give me I am open to it. p  pThanksp

Negative 1326 pI have a emComboBoxem defined in a emDataGridem as shown.  The codeItemsSourcecode of the emComboBoxem is a List of the custom class codeCodePickListcode containing codeNamecode and codeIDcode properties. The codeDisplayMemberPathcode is the codeNamecode property and the codeSelectedValuePathcode is the codeIDcode property. The codeSelectedValuecode is bound to the codeGLCodecode property on the emDataGridem codeItemsSourcecode.  Note that the codeItemsSourcecode of the emDataGridem is a view.  The emComboBoxem populates properly and the binding of the emComboBoxem selection to the codeGLCodecode property works as well.  All fine and good for strongnewstrong data.  The problem is with the existing data in the codeItemsSourcecode of the emDataGrid.em The textblock of the ComboBox is simply blank. Apparently the emComboBoxem is unable to match the codeGLCodecode property on the emDataGridem codeItemsSourcecode with the codeIDcode property on the emComboBoxem codeItemsSourcecode when the ComboBox ItemsSource loads. These properties are of the same type.

Negative 1326 pFirst, here is what I understand and think what is true for the question.p  ol lipUse fast data types for single variables like counters or codeforcode loop indexes. For examplep  precodedefine LOOPCOUNT 100U  uintfast8t index forindex  0 index lt LOOPCOUNT index      Do something   codepre  pI suppose the most suitable type in here is codeuintfast8tcode since codeindexcode can never exceed 255 and this will be the fastest implementation for all platforms. If I used codeunsigned intcode instead, it will be fastest in 16 bits platforms but will be slower in lt16 bits platforms as codeintcode is 16 bits minimum by standard. Also, if I used codeuint8tcode it will be slower on 8 bits platforms as the compiler adds an codeAND 0xFFcode instruction to check overflow for each increment my ARM7 compiler does that even on full speed optimization. codesizetcode is also not an option since it can be bigger than the native integer size.p  pBad side  of this if an overflow is expected for 8 bits, it is not gonna happen. Programmer should check for overflow manually as heshe should IMHO, which may result in buggy code if forgotten. Also, compiler and even PCLint to my surprise will not give any warningissue if LOOPCOUNT accidentally set to a value bigger than 255 on 8 bits platforms, but the warning will be generated on an 8 bits platform, which will reduce portability and introduce bugs, but this can be avoided with codeifcode checks.pli lipUse least data types as much as possible if memory usage is of concern like in arrays or structures. For examplep  precodeuintleast8t array[100] codepre  pIt is the most portable and efficient way to declare arrays if memory usage is of concern. This type will give a byte array if byte access is possible on the platform, and give the smallest accessible width integer array otherwise. Also, least types can be used in structures if we have arrays of the structure.p  pLeast type can also suffer the problems fast types do, as width of variables can be changed on different platforms for both cases.pli lipAvoid fixed width data types as much as possible as they may not even exist on some platforms, except hardware register access, communication protocol mapping, etc. where we need to know the exact bits of the variable. For examplep  precodetypedef struct      uint8t  flags     uint8t  length     uint8t  data[100]     uint16t crc  attributepacked packaget codepre  pUsually codeattributepackedcode or something similar should be used to ensure no padding will be inserted for these cases, as this can be a problem by itself.pli ol  pNow, if my understanding is true, I think least data types are more likely to be used in arrays or structures, fast data types are more likely to be used for single variables and fixed data types are unlikely to be used in order to achieve maximum portability and efficiency. But typing fast and least every time is not encouraging. So, I think of a type set as followsp  precode    typedef [u]intNt       os[us]exactNt     typedef [u]intfastNt  os[us]Nt      I couldnt come up with a better name      typedef [u]intleastNt os[us]minNt      These may change      typedef uintleast8t   osbytet     typedef uintleast16t  oswordt      ...  codepre  ul liFirst and the important question is, is my understanding trueli liWhat would be the most portable AND efficient way to use C99 standard types and how would you declare them if it is not trueli liDoes my type set makes sense or is it likely to produce buggy codeli ul  pAlso, I would be pleased to know how and where you use C99 standard types.p

Negative 1326 pNormally when you click on a select element, the option you have selected is highlighted by default and as you scroll to other options the highlight follows the pointer. For some reason all of my selects are broken, when you scroll to other options the highlight jumps back to the original selected option and a small bit of highlight is visible underneath the element you are on on the outside margins. When you click on an option things work normally and it gets selected even though the highlight is visually being shown somewhere else, but I cant figure out whats causing it to act this way.p  pImage of problem p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comn2qxz.png altenter image description herep  pIn this example people was the selected option, and I have the pointer over clubs, as you can see its very hard to tell what you are selecting. This is happening in both Chrome and Firefox and in IE the selects wont even let me pick a different option at all, as soon as the dropdown opens it closes again selecting what you already picked.p  pI have been browsing for hours trying to find a fix and all I have found is this question which describes the same issue in chrome specifically. a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions7183522veryweirdchromebehaviorinanopenfocusedselectelementVery weird Chrome behavior in an open focused quotselectquot elementap  pUnfortunately this did not help me because I am not using any javascript on the select elements at all I removed it as part of trying to figure out what the problem is.

I am fairly new to responsive design and I am sure there are better ways to handle responsive content shifting, but thats not really the point of the question.

Negative 1326 pIs there a way to recursively traverse a tree and return an array that is scoped to that recursive methodp  pSo I recently answered someone elses question on this topic. That question can be found here a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions16819177traversingatreeintoanarraySO Questiona. My solution uses an array outside of the scope of the recursion, and therefore the method cannot or at least probably should not return the array. However, is there a way to write a recursive method for traversing trees such that it returns an array Even writing an initial method that calls the recursive one would be fine, but I cant think of a good way to do this.p  pHeres the code that I suggested beforep  precodeprivate List nodeValues  new ArrayList  public void traversePreRecursiveBinarySearchTreeNode node       if node  null              nodeValues.addnode.getValue         traversePreRecursivenode.getLeft         traversePreRecursivenode.getRight       codepre  pAs you can see the codeArrayListcode is outside of the scope of the recursion  And therefore returning it doesnt make a lot of sense. Is there a better way to do thisp
Negative 1326 pI read about the c11 standard but cant understand well the meanning of the following.example are very preferred. p  blockquote   pTwo sets of types are used to determine the partial ordering. For each   of the templates involved there is the original function type and the   transformed function type. [Note The creation of the transformed type   is described in 14.5.6.2.  end note ] The deduction process uses the   transformed type as the argument template and the original type of the   other template as the parameter template. This process is done twice   for each type involved in the partial ordering comparison once using   the transformed template1 as the argument template and template2 as   the parameter template and again using the transformed template2 as   the argument template and template1 as the parameter templatebr    emN3242 14.8.2.4.2emp blockquote

Negative 1326 pIn at least one of our projects we are using Jackson to map bewtween JSON and Java objects and vice versa. We are also using Jettison to map between XML input streams to JSON objects and vice versa. p  pA typical use case of the latter is to apply an XSLT transformation on a source XML document to a JSONized XML structure, which can be directly rendered as JSON using a codeStaxStreamResultcode and a codeMappedXMLStreamWritercode. Now, Im curious if Jackson can do the same as Jettison in the XSLT area. Ive studied the documentation and scrutinized the JAR deliverables, and my conclusion is No, it cannot. But I may have missed something.p  pSo, this is a sanity check. Can I use Jackson to perform XSLT transformations from XML to JSON as well as from JSON to XML, and expect the same result as with Jettsionp

Negative 1326 pJava gives compile time error if we dont write try catch block or try finally block or pass the Exception to its calling Function for checked exception.That is all fine.But,My Question is Why then catch block is made optional i.e. we can write try block then finally block so,It this not a dirty thing to so..Please correct me if I am wrong somewhere..p
Negative 1326 pI currently have a working program that is giving me a harmless but annoying error at runtime. I have a DataGridView that displays select contents of an SQL table, which currently only contains one entry. I have a column in that table called Notes that is designed to be a relatively large storage space for text data the user needs to be able to type out and store detailed notes in a single textbox field. The entry in that column for my one record is according to Word 690 characters in length with spaces, but I receive an error when viewing my DataGridView that claims the column exceeds the MaxLength limit. I have manually set that limit the MaxInputLength property during design time to be 2147483647, which is obviously very far above 690, but the error persists.p  pIm not sure what my DGVs problem is because 690 characters is hardly a big deal storagewise. Could somebody point me to the underlying issue with this error Thanks in advancep

Negative 1326 pI have a stored procedure with 2 issues.  p  ol lipIt has 40 parameters.  I know the first comment is going to be to redesign my stored procedure so it doesnt have 40 parameters.  However, this is a search form with a big criteria section.  So the user is specifying up to 40 different criteria for the search.  Then were passing in these values each as a parameter.  Right now I have a 40 parameter sproc.  Would it be more efficient to pass these in as an XML parameter and parse it inside or a table parameter we are still running SQL 2k5 but are considering an upgrade to 2k12.pli lipThree of my parameters are long strings of Guid values separated by quotes and commas.  Basically the user is presented with a list of product lines, hundreds of them at times.  They then click the ones they want to search. Weve limited the number of lines they can check just because the strings get too long, but were passing a long string of Guids separated by quotes and commas.  I know this isnt the right way to do this.  What would be the standard Trans SQl pattern for passing in arrays or collections of Guid values like this  I have 3 separate fields of the 40 doing this.  We want to do this more efficiently and also be able to pass in more than our current limitation.pli ol

Negative 1326 pI am trying to figure out exactly how I can capture all window messages of a processwindow, from the time it was launched in c.

My goal is to start capturing all messages in real time from before the initial window creation, to the applications exit and output all messages to a textbox or file. So basically from the moment the application was executed.p  pSince I want to capture it from the time it was launched, I probably wont have a window handle as their will be no handle yet. So I am geussing it could be tricky. p  pIs their an application that does this that I can use for reference I only want all messages from on application.p
Negative 1326 pWhen my iOS app plays a Spotify track that has not been offlined, there is sometimes a short lag before play beings. The occasional delay in play is understandable. But the timeposition property on SPPlaybackManager starts advancing when the track is asked to play, rather than when the play begins. Therefore, if a track lags five seconds before play begins, the timeposition value is five seconds more than actual play. This causes a problem as my app uses the timeposition value to display info that corresponds with a specific spot in the song. p  pIn case it makes a difference, Ive adjusted the kTargetBufferLength value to allow crossfade. Could that effect the timeposition propertyp  pThanks in advance for any help on how to sync timeposition with actual playtime.p

Assuming I have a tablep  precodeCREATE TABLE tab    id SERIAL,  PRIMARY KEY   code VARCHAR20,   ....   ....  codepre  pI need to lookup only id PK values dont need any other fields from that table by code, like this.p  precodeSELECT id FROM tab WHERE code IN a, b, c. codepre  pI can create a simple index on code as followsp  precodeCREATE INDEX tabcodeidx ON tab USING btreecode codepre  pI also know that PostgreSQL 9.2 implements index only scan in cases when that index contains all fields referenced in the query. So my question is this. Will I benefit from creating an index which includes both code and idp  precodeCREATE INDEX tabcodeididx ON tab USING btreecode, id codepre  pI searched and could find any info on whether PK values are included with other indexes on that table. If PK was included in all indexes then I would only need to index code in order to look up id values.p

Negative 1326 pIve a web application which is configured to use SSO  Siteminder authentication. Now we have developed over own custom authentication code and want it to be implemented instead of using Siteminder. The application is being deployed in WAS 8.0 server which by default is using Siteminder. So even after we changed our code to perform custom authentication I dont know how when deploying it to server it automatically redirects us to SSO login instead of our custom login page. p  pIn my local machine, the same code picks up this newly developed custom authentication and weve tested it too successfully. But when this code is deployed in actual DEV server, it  ignores our custom login module and goes to Siteminder login page. Do I have to set something at the server side to disable SSO  If so, can anyone tell me how to disable Siteminder at server for my applicationp

Negative 1326 pI am trying to create a simple board game using libGDX. Just that you have a rough idea of what Im trying to do, imagine Bejeweled though mine of course is not as complex.p  pThe game involves a board with cells as squares. Depending on the level, this grid has a different number of cells, like 6x6 or 8x8. I also want to include some nice animation for switching the position of two neighboring cells like in Bejeweled. Of course there also need to be some buttons on the screen.p  pMy question is What is the best way to do this Shall I use a stage and then tables for the grid Can I then still easily make an animation using the Universal Tween Engine Or is it better to draw the Sprites individually Or is there another completely different way of approaching thisp  pThank you for your answers, p  pCheers,p  pTonyp

Teams seem to choose JSF because it is a J2EE standard without really evaluating whether the programming model suits them. We think JSF is flawed because it tries to abstract away HTML, CSS and HTTP, exactly the reverse of what modern web frameworks do. JSF, like ASP.NET webforms, attempts to create statefulness on top of the stateless protocol HTTP and ends up causing a whole host of problems involving shared serverside state. We are aware of the improvements in JSF 2.0, but think the model is fundamentally broken. We recommend teams use simple frameworks and embrace and understand web technologies including HTTP, HTML and CSS.p blockquote  pAs I understand it, theyre basically saying you can fall into a trap if you wrap a stateless protocol like http with a stateful abstraction. ie that a team can run into trouble wrapping their heads around this. p  pMy question is strongIs there evidence to suggest Thoughtworks assertion that JSF is a broken abstractionstrongp

Negative 1326 pIm having a hell of a time here, probably because Im very new to Angular and I dont quite grok everything yet.p  pFirst the scenario, then hopefully some codep  pI have a button that fetches a JSON object from an API call.  It becomes scope.collectors.  p  precodehttp.postget, scope.formData.successfunctiondata      scope.collectors  data.results ... codepre  pThen I take that and make a big list of these items with checkboxes, so you can pick and choose which ones you want to work with.  When youve selected the ones you want, you click another button to collect all of these together and bulk operate on them.p  pSo thats the overall story.  They task Im having trouble with is twofold.  First, Im simply trying to count the number of items that are checked.  Ive done it like thisp  precodeJS     scope.selectedCollectors    HTML     ltdiv ngrepeatcollector in collectorsgt         ltinput typecheckbox namecollectorid                 valuecollector.id                ngmodelselectedCollectors[collector.id]gt     ltdivgt     ltpgtDebug  selectedCollectors ltpgt     ltpgtThere are  selectedCollectors.length  items checkedltpgt codepre  pWhen I select items, the output of selectedCollectors is as expectedp  precode8596784true,7458347true codepre  pBut  selectedCollectors.length  never increments or shows anything at all.p  pThe second thing is basically what Im trying to do is get the subset of the original JSON object to work with, based on the users selection.  Other than looping through each item in scope.collectors and comparing the ID to the IDs in selectedCollectors, is there a better more Angularish way to get this subsetp  pSomething makes me feel like I should take this JSON object and turn it into a pure array, but maybe not...p  pAny advice or help is appreciated.p
Negative 1326 pI am doing a website with laravel 4, I have a problem with the database behind it.p  pI have a field of use garden, home, outdoor, which is the field where the product and the material is used.p  pA material, which is the material that the product are made of.p  pA product, which can be of many different color.p  pA material can have many field of use [for example, plastic can be used in house and in outdoor but even in garden] But field of use can be applied to many material [ for example, plastic and leather can be applied to garden]p  pA product is made of one material, but can have many field of use, for example, pvc materialplastic can be used for garden but even for outdoor. But CANT have a field of use that the material that the product is made of doesnt have.p  pSo i connected many to many product  field of use and material  field of usep  pNow what really drives me mad is that a product can have different language so i made a language table for product.p  pBut what i cant get is that material has many language AND has a description AND image that change with field of use . For example if i am in garden and i use plastic, i want to say plastic can resist UV, but if im in home and i use plastic i want to say plastic is resistant to accidental fall.p  pI tried to implement like this, but i have a loop with material, field of use and product. i dont know if is legit.p  pI also have a nested table with description for material that should change, in base of language chosen AND field of use.p  p1There is a better way to do thisp  p2IF not, to fetch a description of a material, in english, with home field of use i need to joinp  precodeSELECT descriptionfield.description    FROM descriptionfield         JOIN language              ON language.iddescriptionfield.idlanguage        JOIN material              ON material.idmateriallanguage.idmaterial        JOIN fieldofusematerial              ON material.idmaterialfieldofusematerial.idmaterial        JOIN fieldofuse              ON fieldofuse.idfieldofuse  fieldofusematerial.idfieldofuse codepre  pIs it correct I mean ,i never did a loop of many to many relationship.p  p3 when i fill this database with a form, I should 1st make him insert a product, check the material and make him choose material according to the product, then ask for a description for every field of application of the product in every language.p  pEDITp  psince product just can have a material, can i  just take out the many to many field of category and product relationp  pimg srchttpi62.tinypic.comnbrpfo.png altmy databaseDatabasep

For the most part, Ive been able to get JSON files, although there might be something wrong with the way Im converting them, or the original contour data coming from QGIS that makes it incompatible with what Ive tried in d3.p  pThe results that I have gotten when the JSON gets rendered basically look like black boxes  looks like improperly rendered polygons gone wild inside the svg container. If I change the fill color to none I see crazy lines all over. I read somewhere that TopoJSON has to be polygons not lines or polylines since it uses arcs, but I got the same results with GeoJSON. p  pIm wondering if this is a problem with the way Ive exported the contour lines from QGIS and converted to JSON, perhaps the projections are not lining up There also might be some errors in the lines that were created automatically when converting, but Im not sure how to fix these. As you can see in the example image, some of my contours are not closed loops because they extend beyond the boundaries of the area I have data forwant to show. Does it make sense that these are supposed to be rendered as polylines or pathsp  pAlso a note, I am not particularly interested in the geospaciality of these lines in terms of their latlong or geographic location in this project. Basically just using contour lines from real geographic data to display the line patterns. p  pHere is my codep  precodeltscript typetextjavascriptgt var width  500,     height  500  var svg  d3.selectsection1svg.appendsvg     .attrwidth, width     .attrheight, height  d3.jsoncontour.json, functionerror, contour      console.logcontour   var path  d3.geo.path     .projectiond3.geo.mercator      d3.jsoncontour.json, functionerror, json       svg.selectAllpath         .datajson.features         .enter         .appendpath         .attrd, path  ltscriptgt codepre  pSo other than just getting this to render on a basic level, other questions are Will I be able to select individual lines to animate with for example strokedashoffset Does this source JSON still contain elevation data so I can color lines based on elevationp  pThanks for your help in getting me on track with this I would appreciate anyone clarifying this for me and informing me on the best way to render this.p  pstrongEDITstrong Using the code from user1614080s example, Im rendering the lines thusp  precode    svg.selectAllpath     .datatopo.enter     .appendpath     .stylefill, none     .stylestroke, functiond, i          return interpcScaled.properties.ELEV      .attrd, path .eachfunctiond      d.totalLength  this.getTotalLength     console.logd.totalLength   .attrstrokedasharray, functiond  return d.totalLength     d.totalLength .attrstrokedashoffset, functiond  return d.totalLength  .transition     .delayfunctiond, i  return i  200      .duration4000     .easelinear     .attrstrokedashoffset, 0      codepre  pBut I cant get the effect I need lines drawing in.

Negative 1326 pI am writing a C project and am thinking about coding some functions that always have the same parameters and the same output, moreover different and unrelated classes will use them. But I am now reluctant as I have the feeling that such convenience functions are not as OOP as it should be and I am ought to code a minimal class for those functions. So, from a C point of view, are convenience functions a good OOP programming practice Is this a sign of a bad designp  pAn example for illustrationp  pLets say we have two classes, codeclass Spherecode and codeclass Pillowcode. Bot have a member variable codechar[8] hashcode for some maybe different hashing reasons but always using the same hash algorithm. Now I have three optionsp  ul liimplement a member function codemakeHashcode for each classli liimplement a convenience function codemakeHashcode that gets called by the classesli lirefactor the complete design to make codeSpherecodeand codePillowcode child classes of the same parent classli ul  pI dont like the first as it creates duplicate code and I dont like the last option because it leads to cluster of classes where every class is more or less a relative of another class which is clearly bad OOP. p  pOf course, OOP is more of an art and sometimes religion than an exact science. However strongis it in general a good practice to create convenience functions when designing in OOPstrongp

Negative 1326 pAn Apache Bench test revealed that high throughput on the database caused the following...p  ul liApache threads stuck in Sending Reply state, all related to a particular PHP file as seen in Apache extended status.li liMySQL sleeping connections with the same user as used by the PHP file.li ul  pNote Apache Bench was used from a remote location as a mechanism for stressing the database only, ie a script just connected to the DB and ran 5 queries per load.p  pRunning the same Apache Bench tests, but introducing a codemysqlclosecode at the end of the script solved the problem. What Id like to understand is why this happens.p  pA popular theory internally we have is thatp  ol liThe increased throughput on the database somehow prevented Apache from serving its requests properly. A buffer somewhere, either in MySQL or at the OS level got filled up.li liThe Apache requests therefore got stuck in a Sending Reply state, and because there was no codemysqlclosecode at the end of the PHP file a database connection remained open  probably only to expire once MySQLs connection timeout limit was reached and the MySQL connection was closed. strongTo be clear, we are not using codemysqlpconnectcodestrong, but we are using codemysqlconnectcode.li ol  pAs above, whilst weve solved the problem wed love to get to the bottom of this with a solid answer rather than an educated guess.p  pAnyone experienced this before and know of a solution Any tricksthoughtsmethods of identifying this.p

Negative 1326 pI have a strongupgradeShop.ccbstrong file that is a layer and it has buttons on it its a shop to buy upgrades. I have a codeCCScrollViewcode in my codeMainScenecode that I am loading my strongugpradeShop.ccbstrong. Everything works fine, except the buttons. When I click a button on the scrollview, a method is called that is supposed to subtract points from the player, and add the bonuses for the upgrade, and update the points label on codeMainScenecode. The points label is just a codeCCLabelTTFcode and it tells the player how many points the player has. I also have an codeNSLogcode in the method to make sure that it is being called.p  pThe codeNSLogcode is working fine, so the method is being called when the button is tappedclicked.

Negative 1326 pUsing APCu with TYPO3 6.2 extensively, I always get a high fragmentation of the cache over time. I already had values of 99 with a smaller shmsize.p  pIn case you are a TYPO3 admin, I also switched the caches codecachepagesectioncode, codecachehashcode, codecachepagescode currently for testing purposes moved to DB again, codecacherootlinecode, codeextbasereflectioncode, codeextbaseopjectcode as well as some other extension caches to apc backend. Mainly switching the codecachehashcode away from DB sped up menu rendering times dramatically a hrefhttpsforge.typo3.orgissues57953 relnofollowhttpsforge.typo3.orgissues57953ap  p1 Does APC fragmentation matter at all or should I simply watch out that it just never runs out of memoryp  p2 To TYPO3 admins do you happen to have an idea which tables cause fragmentation most and what bit in the apcu.ini configuration is relevant for usage with TYPO3p  blockquote   pI already tried using codeapc.stat  0code, codeapc.userttl  0code, codeapc.ttl  0code as in the T3 caching guide a hrefhttpdocs.typo3.orgtypo3cmsCoreApiReferenceCachingFrameworkFrontendsBackendsIndex.htmlcachingbackendapc relnofollowhttpdocs.typo3.orgtypo3cmsCoreApiReferenceCachingFrameworkFrontendsBackendsIndex.htmlcachingbackendapca and to increase the codeshmsizecode currently at 512M where normally around 100M would be used. Shmsize does a good job at reducing fragmentation, but Id rather have a smaller but full cache than a large one unused.p blockquote  p3 To APCu admins could it be that frequently updating cache entries that change in size as well cause most of the fragmentation Or is there any other misconfiguration that Im unaware ofp  blockquote   pI know there is a lot of entries in cache mainly JSON data from remote servers where some of them update every 5 minutes and normally are a different size each time. If that is indeed a cause, how can I avoid it Btw APCU Info shows there are a lot of entries taking up only 2kB but each with a fragmented spacing of about 200 Bytes.p blockquote  p4 To TYPO3 and APC admins apc has a great integration in TYPO3, but for more frequently updating and many small entries, would you advise a different cache backend than apcp

Im trying to capture a 2d texture or create one OUTSIDE my game class Im trying to use a class as a handler, to pass these texture2ds back and forth between GAME1 and my Renderer I dont WANT to have all my textures inside my main class. Also another thing with this is that Im trying to basically have a generic texture2d CREATOR.p  pAka this isnt for something simple like rendering sprites.

The reason is because XNA wont let me access Graphics device, which is a required parameter OF a texture2D object. So basically im doing all this stuff as a work around just becuase Texture2D requires graphics device as a parameter and I cant willy nilly pass GraphicsDevice INTO an instance of my renderer class ive already tried that and it fails.p  pSo there will be situations in my game where sayp  precodeif Camerazoom1 scalingtexture.dispose scalingtexture  tileclipping.newtexturecamerawidthcamerazoom, cameraheightcamerazoom   call a refresh command here  this.refreshscene... Inside here is a ton of sprite batches because the render target is now set to NEW scalingtexture  after that we do the drawing using spritebatch inside draw function of main game class expecting that a render texture is provided for us by these pre requisites. then after that we call the render command it returns the render target to the screen  then in the draw command AFTER the sprite batches were drawn TO the target surface called scalingtexture We use various parameters to tell it to draw this scalingtexture as a spritebatch.draw inside the  game1 draw class So basically I want to do things in this order  Create new texture of variable size  use it as render target  Do all my spritebatch  call another spritebatch draw the contents of said texture on the screen as the rendering target Dispose of the texture object Check the scaling size of it Re create the scaling texture with a NEW resolution each frame Select it as a render target Do the spritebatchy stuff all over again repeat above for all game loop BUT I want parts of this, mainly the creation of this Texture2D object, and the drawing of it to the backbuffer To all happen inside my Renderer class but for all main game spritebatches to happen inside my main game class This is a problem for me and XNA doesnt seem to want to let me organize it this way Unless im missing something which is why im making this lengthy post ANY and all help is appreciated. Thanks again and I hope I explained myself well enough this time IE my intentions. PLEASE NOTE I am SET on doing things THIS way. I will NEED a texture 2d rendering target that is NON static During MOST of my GAME project. That said.. IT HAS TO have function to wrap it inside Renderer. THere is no way in hell Im going to do this In a spaghetti code fashion Inside GAME1 with nested if statements.  Thanks all codepre  pp

Negative 1326 pI am facing one kinda odd problem and Id appreciate any help. I am looking to have a page submit a Google Adsense code and then save it to the database I have a input field to accept GA code and a submit button, very simple form The thing is, I always get 403 forbidden when submiting a form, if input field contain codeltscriptgtcode as a value. If I try to submit anything else it works fine, but I cant figure out why text must not contain codeltscriptgtcode.p  pNote its not a problem with mysql escape or something similar, it happens even if I comment out complete PHP code. It just seems like POST wont accept this.p  pAnother thing to mention, this problem DOES NOT occurs in localhost xampp, but only when uploaded to Namecheap hosting.p  pAny ideas why this happens and how to make a workaroundp
Negative 1326 pI created a custom content control with its default template.  The template though is not located in the location ThemesGeneric.xaml as it is supposed to be. Instead I placed it in a separate resource dictionary with a different name.  It is merged along with other resource dictionaries in the App.xaml resource dictionary.p  pRunning the code yielded no errors and the control is visible. I tested the application on other machines and the code ran just fine , I would like to point out that these machines are development machines. p  pTesting the application on the client machines non development then revealed some strange behaviour. The custom control was not visible it would only be visible on 1 out 3 client machines.p  pI was able to fix the problem by putting the template in ThemesGeneric.xaml. p  pMy question is how was it able to work without having to put the template in ThemesGeneric.xaml  I have searched on Google but I could find any clear cut explaination .p  pThank youp

So since the rtentry.rtdev field is again a character pointer. So likely the contents of the pointer will  not get copied. Hence even after copy the device name will be pointer to the user space address. p  pSo is it right to access the user space address from kernel space  p

Negative 1326 pI just started working in C after working in VB.Net for a while.  I have a dll that contains frequently used database connection strings and some other db info and another dll that contains frequently used directory paths.  When creating an application in VB, I would use these dlls in a Module to set the environment to testing so the databases would point to the QA versions of the databases and the directories would point to my local directories.  When I was ready to publish the application, I would set the environment to production.  It looked something like this.p  precodeModule MyModule   Friend MyBizDBs As BizDBs   Friend MyBizPaths As BizPaths   Friend TodaysDate As Date    Friend Sub InitializeModule     MyBizDBs  New BizDBsDBReference.BizDatabases.DBConfig.DBEnvironment.QA     MyBizPaths  New BizPathsBizPaths.PathEnvironment.Test     TodaysDate  DBReference.BizDatabases.DBMethods.GetTodaysDate   End Sub End Module codepre  pI could then call InitializeModule at the start of the application and whenever a class needed a connection string or a directory or anything else offered by those dlls, it would be pointing to the correct environment.  Moreover, I didnt need to create a new instance of  MyModule each time.  Instead I could simply writep  precodeUsing sw as new StreamWriterMyBizPaths.ReconciliationReport codepre  pI know C doesnt have Modules.  I know static classes are similar, but I cant initialize the objects MyBizDBs and MyBizPaths to set them to the appropriate environment in static classes.  Im looking at a C Singleton, but that reinitializes each time the class is called.  Is there a better way to achieve what Im trying to do in Cbr Thanksp  pEDIT Here is what the singleton looks like in C.p  precodepublic sealed class MySingleton      private static readonly MySingleton instance  new MySingleton      private MySingleton        public static MySingleton Instance              get                     return instance                    public BizPaths MyBizPaths  new BizPathsBizPaths.PathEnvironment.Test     public BizDBs MyBizDBs  new BizDBsDBConfig.DBEnvironment.QA     public DateTime todaysDate  DBMethods.GetTodaysDate   codepre
Negative 1326 pI have a class that inherits from a DataGridView with 9 columns.

Can anyone enlighten me Thanks.p

On the buttons click I am calling this method to replace the fragments.p  precodepublic void selectFragView view       Fragment fr  null       ifview  popUpView.findViewByIdR.id.popupbtn1           fr  new Fragment1       else ifview  popUpView.findViewByIdR.id.popupbtn2           fr  new Fragment2       else ifview  popUpView.findViewByIdR.id.popupbtn3           fr  new Fragment3             Create new transaction       FragmentTransaction transaction  getSupportFragmentManager.beginTransaction         Replace whatever is in the fragmentcontainer view with this fragment,        and add the transaction to the back stack       transaction.replaceR.id.fragmentplace, fr         Commit the transaction       transaction.commit  codepre  pHere fragmentplace is the linear layout fragment container. The problem is, this method is inside MainActivity and R.id.fragmentplace is not in the xml file of this activity, but in the xml file of popup window.p  pSo, whenever I click on any button I get this error.p  precode    java.lang.IllegalArgumentException No view found for id 0x7f080008 com.learn.popupdemoidfragmentplace for fragment Fragment142a65d60 0 id0x7f080008 codepre  pHow can I add and replace fragments inside PopupWindowp

Negative 1326 pI have created a Webservice from a BAPI in SAP to insert some AccountDocuments into SAP. The system in these cases needs a COMMITcall after a successful insert call.

When I save the form, it goes back to the tree view, the element modified.p  pHow I tried to do this p  pI have my main view, treeView, with its controller treeViewController. I have a factory, which loads the elements.p  precodetreeViewController scope  factory.getelement whatever else I need codepre  pIve tried to have another view fullEdit and I want it to share the scope, completely it can also share the same controller it doesnt mater actually. Thats means when I modify scope.element in fullEdit its modified in the tree.p  pProblem is, as the controller loads the scope, everytime I switch the view I reload the  scope.p  pIve tried uirouter with nested states I dont think thats the solution. Multipleviews is advised by many to get what I want, but Ive tried it and all I get is both views on the same page, which is not what I want. Moreover it seems that these two views are still independent.p  pAlso,using the global scope doesnt seem a good solution.p  pEDIT actually my issue is that when I change views the controllers are executed, thus the scope is reloaded from the back end. I dont want that, I want to share the scope but not reload it every time I change the view p

Negative 1326 pIve got a function worked out that creates a new query ui tab panel when a user clicks a button.

Ive tried cloning the button and appending it to the panel, but it doesnt seem to work. Any ideas I should mention that the content of the current tab is replaced when the user clicks a link, so the button probably needs to be inserted before the active tab panel, rather than inside it so it doesnt get removed when the content is updated.p

Negative 1326 pThis has been asked various times and I have studied most of the answers here on SO ,saying that making different folders like codelayoutcode,codelayoutxlargelandcode etc.which are deprecated or codelayoutsw200dpcode,codelayoutsw600dpcode etc. will solve my issue of strongSupporting Multiple Screens for some devices in Androidstrong. But then I came across a hrefhttpstackoverflow.coma5432531681929strongthisstronga. and I think it is the best answer that struck me. But I dont know that how to achieve the same which answerer is depictingp  blockquote   pAndroid runs on an enormous variety of devices, more every week, and   many formats dont exist yet but will introduce new variables. So even   if you succeed, one new device with a slightly different screen size,   and your app will fail.p      pIts a mistake to design for Android using specific screen   resolutions, and is similar to the issues youd find if you forced all   pages to be the exact same size on the web, it rarely works well e.g.   even a tidy fixedwidth site will fail miserably on mobile devices.p      pAndroid has been designed to support all this variation, but if you   try to get pixelperfect absolutepositioned rendering on every screen   size you are swimming against the tide. It is likely to be very   painful, very time consuming and expensive, and likely to ultimately   fail. Even if you succeed, how on earth will you test it on all these   screen variants It sounds like testing hell too.p      pI STRONGLY recommend you accept you cannot do everything as exactly as   you need to, and instead look at how to use ways of rendering objects   fluidly, relative to each other, so the app looks good in all the   different variations, using the different layouts for each group of   resolutions to improve the experience on different size screens.p blockquote

Negative 1326 pAm trying to modify a java code that implements Analog Clock using BufferedImage. I want the face of the clock to be changed dynamically when a user clicks on a button that scrolls through an array preloaded with the locations of images. So far my attempts have failed. I have two classes The first Class creates and displays the Analog, and the second class attempts to change the face of the Analog clock using a mutator setAnalogClockFace and an accessor getAnalogClockFace. The following is the code for the first Class as found on a hrefhttpwiki.scn.sap.comwikidisplaysnippetsimplmentingaGUIanalogtimerusingjavaswing relnofollowherea, with minor modificationsp

Negative 1326 pstrongBackgroundstrongp  pWhen deleting a cell in a hash table that uses linear probing you have to indicate that a value once existed at that cell but can be skipped during a search. The easiest way to solve this is to add another variable to store this information, but this extra variable can be avoided if an guaranteed invalid memory address is known and is used to represent this state.p  pstrongQuestionstrongp  pI assume that since 0 is a guaranteed invalid memory address more often than not, there must be more than just NULL. So my question is, does C provide a standard macro for any other guaranteed invalid memory addressesp

Negative 1326 pI have two nav bars, one for the home page, and one for the rest of the site. Im not sure how to go about doing this in a good DRY way. It seems like i want to put the rest of the sites navbars in the layouts views, but I dont know how to exclude a layout from a page I guess The rest of the home page layout is the same as the rest of the site, so the only thing I would want to exclude is the nav bar for that page and replace it with another. The links will also be the same. So navigationlinks can also be rendered in both.p

Negative 1326 pBrand new to both Ruby and Rails here, and I just got started on my first project. Went through the new tutorial on Lynda first, then started a new project where Im so far using RailsAdmin, CanCan and Devise.p  pTrying to do some more advanced authorization with CanCan, and Im struggling a bit figuring out how to do this. For a normal user Im now doingp  precodecan access, railsadmin can dashboard can read, [Company, ProductCategory] can [read, update], User, id gt user.id can manage, [Product, Catalog], companyid gt user.company.id can manage, [Image, Video, Document, Link] cannot export, all codepre  pWhich is working great, but Im struggling a bit with images, videos, documents and links. These all belongto a Product or a Catalog, and doing it the way Im doing it above gives the user access to any file. So ideally I would want something likep  precodecan manage, [Image, Video, Document, Link], product.companyid gt user.company.id codepre  pBut obviously I cant do that since there is no product, but just the productid of the product the file belongs to. So how would I access the company id of the product referred to by the productid on the filesp  pIn addition to that a company can be a subcompany of another company which can be a subcompany of another company etc etc. So how would I do something likep  precodecan manage [Product, Catalog], [companyid, company.company.id, company.company.company.id etc] gt user.company.id codepre  pBasically a user should be able to manage products and catalogs that belong to their company, or that belong to any subcompany of their company.p  hr  pstrongEDITEDstrong for clarity and simplificationp  pCompany1 has subcompany Company2, Company2 has subcompany Company3 and Company3 has subcompany Company4.p  pUser belongs to Company2 not Company1.p  pUser should then manage all Companies starting at Company2, meaning it should be able to manage Company2, Company3 and Company4, but not Company1.p  pSo I tried addingp  precodecan manage, Company, companyid gt user.company.id can manage, Company, company gt  companyid gt user.company.id  can manage, Company, company gt  company gt  companyid gt user.company.id    codepre  pSo the 2 first lines here seem to work, and I can see both Company2 and Company3. But Company4  which is supposed to be handled by the third line  does not seem to show in the listing nor can it be managed by this user.p  pSo Why isnt that line working And how can I get this all on one line and handled unlimited levels of companies instead of adding one line for each new level I addp

Negative 1326 pI extend the cgi.FieldStorage class in order to have a custome storage basicly to store the uploaded data in a temporary directory defined by my application.

Negative 1326 pI really like the way Spring Data Repositories work when exposed with RepositoryRestResource as HALRESTful resources. Currently I have a few repositories that represent tables in a few different databases. I have a multiple Spring Data JPA repositories hitting mutiple SQLServer databases with multiple datasources and a Spring Data Cassandra repository. p  pIn the future the implementation of an entity may be spread across multiple databases. Like if most of the row is static, but one field changes a lot we may move it to cassandra. That means the object the client expects will now need to be built by querying multiple databases.p  pIn this case I would not want my endpoint to change but I would just change my implementation to build a DTO from both tables.

Negative 1326 pI have an android project in Eclipse which simply contains a jni directory containing c code which gets compiled into a native shared library, lets say libmod1.so. Then I have another android frontend project, which also contains a jni directory. Ive set that project up to create a native shared library lets say libwrapper.so which I want to act as an interface to access libmod1.so, calling its functions etc. p  pIve seen a few questions about writing Android.mk files to express shared library dependencies but none Ive seen refer to linking custom made libraries in separate Eclipse projects. p  pRather than rely on a complicated make file though, if possible Id like to instruct Eclipse to compile and copy the libmod1.so library into the jni directory of the frontend project whenever its built. From there I can compile it into the libwrapper.so library. p  pDoes anyone know how to achieve this in Eclipse p  pOr, can anyone suggest a better method of achieving the result Im after Id prefer separate projects because I want to use the libmod1.so library with various frontend projects in future and so I want it to be in its own project. p

Negative 1326 pIm installing numpy through pip on python 2.7.9... I checked codepip listcode, and it returns codepip 1.5.6, setuptools 12.0.4code.

Negative 1326 pSo gcc or any C compiler will compile your source to x86 or your respective Assembly language then assemble the assembly into binary and then link it to create an executable.

Negative 1326 pIm trying to write a for loop that will take zip codes, make an API call to a database of Congressional information and then parse out only the parties of congressmen representing at zip code. p  pThe issue is that some of the zip codes have more than one congressman and others have none at all, an error on the part of the database, I think. That means I need to loop through the count returned by the original pull until there are no more representatives.p  pThe issue is that the number of congressmen representing each zip code is different. Thus, Id like to be able to write new variable names into my dataframe for each new congressman. That is, if there are 2 congressmen, Id like to write new columns named party.1 and party.2, etc. p  pI have this code so far and I feel that Im close, but Im really stuck on what to do next.

Negative 1326 pI currently have an ASP.NET web forms application that I have been working on for a few months now and I am planning on adding a custom authentication system to it. When I originally created the project I created a C Web Forms WebApp w No Authentication. The reason I want it to be completely custom is because I hate having things in my application that I didnt build and fully understand. I.e. the newer Identity Auth providerp  pBelow is my idea of a simplecustom authentication system Unique Usernamep  pHashed Salted wcustom salt added UserPassword using blowfish encryption algorithm unable to retrieve this password, meaning they have to create a new one if they want to change itp  pA UserRoles table and a UserRolesAccess table. Associating UserRoles to Users whether it is through a comma separated string field directly in the Users table or a completely separate table to handle the many to many relationship.p  pThe workflow that I have in mind User enters information to login form I check the database to find a User where UserName and Password entered match. I retrieve the Users information and just start creating several Session variables UserAuthenticatedtrue, UserRolesAdmin for example. Then in the page load of my master page I will just always check if if Session[UserAuthentication]  False, redirect to home page. Then on each individual page set a string property called PageUserRoles and in the page load set a property checking if Session[UserRoles]  to PageUserRoles then redirect to home page.p  pPlease feel free to rip the above apart with security problems. The reason I created this post is to figure out if I could use it or not.p  pFinally, I was looking into this great Forms Authentication post   a hrefhttpwww.codeproject.comArticles408306UnderstandingandImplementingASPNETCustomForm relnofollowhttpwww.codeproject.comArticles408306UnderstandingandImplementingASPNETCustomFormap  pIt seems like everything I described above is very similar except for the FormsAuthentication Auth Cookie that is set and being able to define user role access in the Web.config file. I want to know how important this cookie is and if people definitely recommend that I go the route of incorporating my custom Auth with Forms Auth rather than just my completely custom Auth system.p  pI am really trying to stay away from the newer Identity membership Auth since it is way beyond my expertise and what I want in my application. My goal is just to have a clean, simple, secure Auth system.p

Negative 1326 pIm using spring boot and spring cloud, and have followed the example from FluxCapacitor to register a ZookeeperConfigurationSourcebacked DynamicWatchedConfiguration.p  pI know that zookeeper is sending me the updates when a property changes because I can set breakpoints in the ZooKeeperConfigurationSource to catch this.  However, the events that get propagated through the springnetflix code never actually update the DyanmicProperty that is cached.  It does update the DynamicWatchedConfigurations local cache.  The mainregistered configuration is the ConcurrentCompositeConfiguration and the only configuration above my Zookeeperbacked one is the dynamic URL config source which actually doesnt do anything bc Im not operating in AWSspring cloud environment.p  pI suppose it is worth mentioning that when I start the app from scratch it DOES pick up the values current in zookeeper at the time, but then they are stuck at those values until I restart the app.p  pMy question is... has anyone gotten this working such that when zookeeper is updated, the actual result of calling DynamicPropertyFactory.getInstance.getStringProperty....get reflects the update as wellp

Negative 1326 pI am very confused in my implementation of sessions in asp.net web application. My logic is once user enters user namepassword, I validate credentials and then create a new session with some user info[All I am after from this point onward is that this user has access to restricted resources and a user must never be able to access those resources unless heshe is authenticated]. This I validate on each request and the rest. Here is my issue though. I have many places in the website where I have html links, and I read that if I have a link such asp  precodelta hrefresource1.aspxgtresource 1ltagt codepre  pThis will generate a new session id, hence in reality invalidating the existing session id, which in my case will be treated as session expired and user is sent to login page. While reading up on this issue I came across an asp.net API method[p  precodeResponse.ApplyAppPathModifierurl codepre  p] which prepends the session id to each request hence resolving the new session id generation for each link. Though it resolves session breaking issue it does add the session id next to all of the urls and now session id can be seen in the source code view source for web page. I really dont want to use cookies and want to use session for user sessions...Can some one please help me create a system which will work the way I wish it to  if I am doing it utterly incorrect, I would really really appreciate a details discussion and if possible some example...Thanks you much in advance..p

Then inside the codetrycode block I stop the client and assign a new coderedisPubSubcode created as above to the coderedisClientcode var. Thats an ugly hack which is also error prone e.g. if there genuinely emisem a problem creating the second client, the catch block will try to call methods on an erroneous object. p  pIs there a better way of writing this code so that I can correctly call codestopcode on the redisClient if an exception is raised when trying to send the message to the responseObserverp  pstrongUpdatestrongp  pIve just solved this using promises.

Negative 1326 pI have an SSIS package that I created in Visual Studio 2008.  The package and solution file are saved to a shared drive.  To run the package, I doubleclick on the sln file to open it in Visual Studio 2008, and I run the debugger.  When I do so on my machine, the package runs as expected.  However, when other users except for one do so on their machines, the package does not run as expected.p  pThe package is a fairly simple flat file import to an SQL Server table via an ODBC connection.  It has a Foreach loop container that sweeps for all files with an expected file name, and it imports each of the found files into the table.  So, there is a Foreach loop container with a data flow task inside of it.p  pWhen other users except for one run it on their machines by opening the sln file from the shared drive, the package goes green on the Foreach loop container, but the data flow tasks does not go green.  This suggests that the package did not find one of the expected files.p  pWhy does the data flow task go green for me and one other user, but not for anyone else  My best guess is that it has something to do with privileges, but I have no way of determining that. p

Negative 1326 pstrongUPDATEstrong Thanks to rickhg12s for pointing out that it appears I may have stumbled upon a bug. codemethodexistslt, MyType, MyTypecode is returning codetruecode while codemethodexistsisless, MyType, MyTypecode is returning codefalsecode. Im on v0.3.x but rickhg12s is on the nightly build of v0.4, so Ill file an issue.p  pHow do I check if a method exists for a particular typep  pI thought I could do this using, for examplep  precodemethodexistslt, Int, Int codepre  pwhich will return codetruecode since the less than comparison is defined for two integers. However, when I define my own typep  precodetype MyType end codepre  pand then tryp  precodemethodexistslt, MyType, MyType codepre  pit returns codetruecode. But I thought that it would return codefalsecode, sincep  precodea  MyType a lt a codepre  pthrows an error since codeltcode is not defined for codeMyTypecode. So how can I detect at runtime whether a method for a given type existsp

The controls do show up in Inspect.  Theres nothing special about the problem tabs.  Theyre the same as all the other tabs in the application.p  pIs there a reason why some parts of an MFC application wont show up in UI Automation or UIAVerifyp
Negative 1326 pin shortp  pI imported 2 Android Projects. I got it built and run after alot of changes. BUT after restarting eclipse the classpath is unable to get the system library Android sdk 4.1.2 for the Projects. p  pAll solutions, which i found for unable to get the system library were only temporal, which means after restarting it was broken again.p  pThere is one strange exception When i close the second project and restart Eclipse, the first project gets successfully build. p  pThe second project is a test Project to test the first project, so the second project depends on the first project.p  pDetailsp  pstrongSetupstrongp  pThe original projects were made in Windows 7. Now imported on a Mac OS X. I freshly installed Eclipse Kepler Service Release 2 and the plugins on the Mac. I copied the eclipse workspace from the windows device to get the same properties and configs. The Eclipse on the windows device is Kepler Service Release 2. p  pThe projects are Android Maven projects with EGit for version control. So i installed the following listed stuff and copied the corresponding configuration files etc. from the windows device and adjusted the paths for the mac etc. by my best knowledge   android sdk 4.1.2 and higher   android development tools v23   maven v3.1.1   m2e  Maven Integration for Eclipse v1.4.0   Eclipse Git Team Provider  Java implementation of Git 3.7.1p  pEven though i copied the Eclipse workspace, it does not contain the 2 projects, because they are stored in the local git repository, which is not in the workspace.that might be strange but it worked and i dont think that that is the issue. p  pfor completeness, this is the bash.profile i am using right now it had many different versions over the try and error process p  precodeexport JAVAHOMELibraryJavaJavaVirtualMachinesjdk1.7.079.jdkContentsHome export PATHPATHJAVAHOMEbin export ANDROIDHOMEUsersNAMEDocumentsDevelopmentandroidsdkmacosx export PATHPATHANDROIDHOMEtoolsANDROIDHOMEplatformtools export M2HOMEUsersNAMEDocumentsDevelopmentapachemaven3.1.1 export PATHPATHM2HOMEbin export MAVENOPTSXms1024m Xmx4096m XXPermSize1024m export GITUsersNAMEDocumentsDevelopmentGit export PATHPATHGIT codepre  pAfter installing and adjusting all the plugins and configuration for the mac i imported the project with EGit by fileimportGitProjects from Git and cloned it from the URI. That way it was downloaded to the local repository and finally added to the workspace. Up until now it was all predicted troubleshooting but maybe required information to know the setup.p  pstrongThe Symptomstrongp  pUnder projectpropertiesjava build pathLibrary it says Unable to get system library for the project for both Projects, when restarting Eclipse after Eclipse finished to build the workspace.p  pstrongTemporal solutionsstrongp  pNow there are multiple ways, that i found in the last couple of hours in the internet to fix that temporarily, like   eclipsepropertiesandroid switch target  apply  switch back   deleting stuff in files  projectandroidfix project properties   cleanging and rebuilding the project    and multiple variations with the androidfix project propertiesp  pBut the Problem just reappears after restarting Eclipse andor restarting the Mac.p  pstrongTroubleshootingstrongp  pSince the build path is managed by maven, here are the POM filesp  precode  First project  ltproject ...     ltmodelVersiongt4.0.0ltmodelVersiongt     ltgroupIdgtCENSORltgroupIdgt     ltartifactIdgtCENSORltartifactIdgt     ltversiongt1.1.2ltversiongt     ltpackaginggtapkltpackaginggt     ltnamegtCENSORltnamegt      ltpropertiesgt         ltproject.build.sourceEncodinggtUTF8ltproject.build.sourceEncodinggt         ltplatform.versiongt 4.1.1.4  ltplatform.versiongt         ltandroid.plugin.versiongt3.6.0ltandroid.plugin.versiongt     ltpropertiesgt      ltdependenciesgt         ltdependencygt             ltgroupIdgtcom.google.androidltgroupIdgt             ltartifactIdgtsupportv4ltartifactIdgt             ltversiongtr6ltversiongt         ltdependencygt         ltdependencygt             ltgroupIdgtcom.google.androidltgroupIdgt             ltartifactIdgtandroidltartifactIdgt             ltversiongtplatform.versionltversiongt             ltscopegtprovidedltscopegt         ltdependencygt         ltdependencygt             ltgroupIdgtcom.google.androidltgroupIdgt             ltartifactIdgtandroidtestltartifactIdgt             ltversiongtplatform.versionltversiongt             ltscopegtprovidedltscopegt         ltdependencygt         ltdependencygt             ltgroupIdgtcom.sun.jerseyltgroupIdgt             ltartifactIdgtjerseybundleltartifactIdgt             ltversiongt1.8ltversiongt         ltdependencygt         ltdependencygt             ltgroupIdgtorg.slf4jltgroupIdgt             ltartifactIdgtslf4japiltartifactIdgt             ltversiongt1.7.5ltversiongt         ltdependencygt         ltdependencygt             ltgroupIdgtcom.github.tony19ltgroupIdgt             ltartifactIdgtlogbackandroidcoreltartifactIdgt             ltversiongt1.0.102ltversiongt         ltdependencygt         ltdependencygt             ltgroupIdgtcom.github.tony19ltgroupIdgt             ltartifactIdgtlogbackandroidclassicltartifactIdgt             ltversiongt1.0.102ltversiongt         ltdependencygt         ltdependencygt             ltgroupIdgtnet.sf.flexjsonltgroupIdgt             ltartifactIdgtflexjsonltartifactIdgt             ltversiongt2.0ltversiongt         ltdependencygt         ltdependencygt             ltgroupIdgtcom.j256.ormliteltgroupIdgt             ltartifactIdgtormliteandroidltartifactIdgt             ltversiongt4.48ltversiongt         ltdependencygt         ltdependencygt             ltgroupIdgtcom.j256.ormliteltgroupIdgt             ltartifactIdgtormlitecoreltartifactIdgt             ltversiongt4.48ltversiongt         ltdependencygt         ltdependencygt             ltgroupIdgtcom.androidplotltgroupIdgt             ltartifactIdgtandroidplotcoreltartifactIdgt             ltversiongt0.6.1ltversiongt         ltdependencygt         ltdependencygt             ltgroupIdgtorg.achartengineltgroupIdgt             ltartifactIdgtachartengineltartifactIdgt             ltversiongt1.2.0ltversiongt         ltdependencygt     ltdependenciesgt     ltbuildgt         ltfinalNamegtproject.artifactIdltfinalNamegt         ltpluginManagementgt             ltpluginsgt                 ltplugingt                     ltgroupIdgtcom.jayway.maven.plugins.android.generation2ltgroupIdgt                     ltartifactIdgtandroidmavenpluginltartifactIdgt                     ltversiongt3.8.2ltversiongt                     ltextensionsgttrueltextensionsgt                 ltplugingt                 ltThis plugins configuration is used to store Eclipse m2e settings only.

ltprojectDescriptiongt codepre  pSince the Problem can be solved temporarily, i assume that the android, maven and git configurations are correct but that some hidden files in the eclipse workspace are causing the problem. therefore i deleted multiple files in eclipseworkspace  .metadata  .plugins. for example files like   eclipseworkspace  .metadata  .plugins.   org.eclipse.core.resources .root  .markers.snap.    eclipseworkspace  .metadata  .plugins.  org.eclipse.core.resources  .root  .indexes properties.indexp  pstrongThere might be still a File, that i could try to deletestrong Remember this workspace is copied from a Windows device.p  pIn the process of troubleshooting i deleted the projects and imported it in eclipse as maven project and as android project instead of as gitproject from the local git repository. It doesnt changed anything.p  pwhen i close the second project and restart eclipse, the first project has no problems. And this is strange, since the first project doesnt require the second project. Maybe the second Project does something with the android sdk. But when i fix the issue temporarily by switching the android target back and forth, then the Builder has no Problem with building both projects.p  pWhen i disable build automatically and restart eclipse and then activate it again, it builds both projects successfully. But i want build automatically be enabled. p  pstrongMaybe something doesnt processes fast enough, when starting Eclipsestrong p  pSo im looking for a Solution, that i dont have to reapply the Android SDK each time, when i restart eclipse or the Macp  pTo be clear, i worked on the Windows device and therefore know that this issue wasnt an issue there.p
Negative 1326 pI have a chat website using node js and angular, and I have made the loginsignup and chat page using these. but the problem is, whenever I load the chat page it uses the style from the other pages, and basically acts like a different section of the same page, It also merges the loginsignup together, which is ok, because they have the same style just different number of form boxes, I want to stop angular from merging the styles from the loginsignup with the chat and have it use its own style.  All help would be very much apreciated, thanks in advance.  And as far as I have been told and know, there is nothing in my own code that is preventing this, it is only angular itself. strongstrong textstrongBy the way, As far as I know, certain things the body of the different pages cant be individually styled, and If I were to merge htmls it would take a while and research and I dont really want to do so.p

After that the button Insert on the 3rd form should be rendered if file is valid and no data from this file exists in database. When there is a small amount of data in the file  all is OK. But when there is a big amount of data  response returns before all data in file validatedbefore actionListener method ended. This leading to potential mistake when bad data in the end of file and validates after response is sended.p  pI think, i can do this in another way  just add validation button and validate file after upload, but i want to use fileUpload actionlistener for upload and validation at the same time.p  pAnybody have an idea why response returns before actionListener method endedp

Negative 1326 pI am new to multilanguage app. What I am doing is, an app with two languages. English amp Arabicp  pThe language of the app depends upon the device language. I want to change this too, that app language should be controlled from inside the app. not device dependant but thats next questionp  pI am having some controls like codeUIButtoncode,codeUITextFieldcode,codeUILabelcode, etc....p  pWhen my app is in English I gave these controls frame starting from left corner of device, and when my app is in Arabic I gave them frames starting from Right corner of device. As arabic is written from Right  to  leftp  pMy Question is, For this purpose I need to do extra work, i.e. check device language and then set the frames of control. on each view I may have n number of controls, and giving the frame sizes to all controls for both language doesnt seems good from my view.p  pIs there anything available in codeXcodecode itself by using which I can do this. means I need to give frames for default language i.e. English and if my device language is change to Arabic then frames of Controls will be automatically Mirrored from Right to left.p  pFollowing screens may give some idea. I used different frames for all those controls checking device languagep  pAny help is accepted.p  pThanks in advance. sorry If question is asked already. But I didnt find anything.

The factory is passed in through the IWorld implementations constructor. p  pMy question now is, where should the factory implementation exist Is it common for the same project that contains the domain interface implementations to provide an implementation for the factory or should the consuming layer such as the presentationunit test projects be responsible for implementing the factories and using them p  pThe intent is that these components can be swapped out depending on the kind of textbased game you are building. So I was leaning towards each package implementing the interfaces having their own factory. What I am concerned with though is the DI setup. The IoC container further up in the layering serverclient apps would need to know which factory in each package it should use, as opposed to just using one that is defined in the consuming layer that the IoC container is a part of.p  pIs there any industry standard guidance on thisp
Negative 1326 pIm working on my first django project that involves a student gradebook. Starting small, Im just working on an app where teachers can upload students student information  name and email address and organize them into courses.  My models so far arep  precodeclass Coursemodels.Model     coursename  models.CharFieldmaxlength20, defaultCourse      def unicodeself         return self.coursename   class Studentmodels.Model     course  models.ForeignKeyCourse     nametext  models.CharFieldmaxlength40, defaultFirst Last     emailaddress  models.EmailFieldmaxlength40, defaultaddressaddress.com      def unicodeself         return self.nametext codepre  pHowever, Im not sure if the Course class is needed. I didnt think much of it, until I tried to create my first form where a user adds a student to the database.  I had triedp  precodeclass StudentFormforms.ModelForm      class Meta         model  Student         fields nametext, codepre  pBut this didnt work.  I would get an error saying that the course field could not be null null value in column courseid violates notnull constraint.  So I modified to fields course, nametext,.  That worked.p  pThis is what got me wondering if the Course class would actually be necessary.  Ultimately I would like to be able to upload a text file with student names, parse the text to get the names and email addresses and create instances of the students. Only then would I assign the students to a course.  But I get the feeling that the way I have my model setup right now will always insist that the student is assigned a course.p  pShould the class Course be keptp

Negative 1326 pI am writing my own audio format as part of a game console project. Part of the project requires me to write an emulator so I know exactly how to implement its functions in hardware. I am currently writing the DSP portion, but I am having trouble writing a decoding algorithm. Before I go further, Ill explain my format.p  pstrongDST Dingo Sound Track Audio formatstrongp  pThe audio format only records to pieces of data per sample the amplitude and the number of frames since the last sample. Ill explain. When converting an audio file WAV for example, it compares the current sample with the previous one. If it detects that the current sample switches amplitude direction in relation to the previous sample, it records the previous sample and the number of frames since the last record. It keeps going until the end of the file. Here is a diagram to explain furtherp  pa hrefhttpi.stack.imgur.come5LWe.png relnofollowimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.come5LWe.png altenter image description hereap  pstrongWhat I need to dostrongp  pI need my DSP to figure out the data between each sample, as accurately as possible using only the given information. I dont think its my encoding algorithm, because when I play the file in Audacity, I can sort of make out the original song. But when I try to play it with my decoding algorithm, I get scattered clicks. I am able to play WAV files directly with a few mods to the algorithm with almost no quality drop, so I know its definitely the algorithm and not the rest of the DSP.p  pstrongThe Codestrongp  pSo now I got all of the basic info out of the way, here is my code only the important parts.p  pEncoding algorithmp  precode                FileInputStream s  null                 BufferedWriter bw                     try                          int bytes                         int previous  0                         int unsigned                         int frames  0                         int size                         int cursor  0                         boolean dir  true                         int bytes2                         int previous2  0                         int unsigned2                         int frames2  0                         boolean dir2  true                         s  new FileInputStreamselectedFile                         size  ints.getChannel.size                         File f  new FileDirectory.getPath    selectedFile.getName.replace.wav, .dts                         System.out.printlnf.getPath                         iff.exists                             f.createNewFile                                                  bw  new BufferedWriternew FileWriterf                         try BufferedInputStream b  new BufferedInputStreams                              byte[] data  new byte[128]                             b.skip44                             System.out.printlnLoading...                             while bytes  b.readdata gt 0                                 do something                               forint i1 iltbytes i  4                                    unsigned  data[i] amp 0xFF                                   if dir                                        if unsigned lt previous                                            bw.writeprevious                                           bw.writeframes                                           dir  dir                                           frames  0                                       else                                           frames                                                                            else                                        if unsigned gt previous                                            bw.writeprevious                                           bw.writeframes                                           dir  dir                                           frames  0                                       else                                           frames                                                                                                              previous  unsigned                                   cursor                                    unsigned2  data[i  2] amp 0xFF                                   if dir2                                        if unsigned2 lt previous2                                            bw.writeprevious2                                           bw.writeframes2                                           dir2  dir2                                           frames2  0                                       else                                           frames2                                                                            else                                        if unsigned2 gt previous2                                            bw.writeprevious2                                           bw.writeframes2                                           dir2  dir2                                           frames2  0                                       else                                           frames2                                                                                                              previous2  unsigned2                                   cursor                                    progress.setValueintfloatcursor  size  100                                                                                         b.readdata                                                  bw.flush                         bw.close                         System.out.printlnDone                         convert.setEnabledtrue                         status.setTextfinished                      catch Exception ex                          status.setTextAn error has occured                         ex.printStackTrace                         convert.setEnabledtrue                                  finally                      try                          s.close                      catch Exception ex                          status.setTextAn error has occured                         ex.printStackTrace                         convert.setEnabledtrue                                       codepre  pThe progress and status objects can be ignored for they are part of the GUI of my converter tool.

This algorithm set is designed to convert stereo tracks, which works the same way in my format but each sample will contain two sets of data, one for each track.p  pstrongThe Questionstrongp  pHow do I figure out the missing audio between each sample, as accurately as possible, and how accurate will the approach be I would love to simply use the WAV format, but my console is limited on memory RAM. This format halves the RAM space required to process audio. I am also planning on implementing this algorithm in an ARM microcontroller, which will be the consoles real DSP. The algorithm should also be fast, but accuracy is more important. If I need to clarify or explain anything further, let me know since this is my first BIG question and I am sure I forgot something. Code samples would be nice, but arent needed that much.p  pstrongEDITstrongp  pI managed to get the DSP to output a song, but its sped up and filled with static. The sped up part is due to a glitch in it not splitting the track into stereo I think. And the static is due to the initial increment being too steep.

Edit the result wave should actually be backwards. Sorry.p  pstrongSecond Editstrong I got the DSP to output in stereo, but unfortunately that didnt fix anything else like I hoped it would. I also fixed some bugs with the encoder so now it takes 8 bit unsigned audio. This has become more of a math issue so I think Ill post a similar question in Mathematics Stack Exchange. Well that was a waste of time. It got put on fhold near instantly.p

Negative 1326 pIm having a strange problem using the jquery blueimp fileupload on an asp.net website. After some trial an error i have it up an running without much problem, and its working more or less properly. However, theres some strange behaviour i cant work out. As the norm with any jquery plugins, it has to be initialized once the page loads. However, i cant use a regular document.ready due to the fact the webform it has to be used in contains multiple updatepanels, hence i need to use a pageLoad function in order to keep the plugin initialized after any hidden postback the updatepanel may fire. Now, the strange behaviour comes once i do an upload. If i do any other action in the webform causing an action from the update panel the next file i try to upload is uploaded twice. If i do yet another action, the next file i upload is uploaded 3 times, etc.p  pTrying to destroy the plugin on every pageLoad seems to make no difference. And initializing it inside a document.ready makes no effect, since this only happens on the very first form load. Any ideas. Thanksp

Negative 1326 pMy team and I are working on a mobile app developed using emJQuery Mobileem and emHTML 5em. The app is supposed to read posts from our wordpress site. These posts come with specific pdf files for each specific posts. The user is then supposed to purchase the PDF then after payment the file is downloaded to the users phone. Downloading a single pdf is not an issue. Our issue is making sure that the download button retrieves a pdf that is related to that particular post only for every post. Is there any solution to this rather than using a simple anchor tag since an anchor tag has an already defined linkurlp

Negative 1326 pI have two activities.  The second activity if for data collection from the user he types in new data and the first for showing graphs.  Once the user finish the second activity by clicking back, I need to do calculations before the charts update on the MainActivity.  It is important that the calculations finish first before activity 2 is finished.  The code therefore runs in the onBackPressed method.p  pThere seemed to be three optionsp  p1 Use a thread that does the calculations and update the ProgressDialog with a seperate handler to watch for thread completion.  The handler receives a message once the thread is complete and then close the second activity.  Android Studio warns me that the handler needs to be static and warns me of memory leaks.  So this doesnt seem to be a safe approach.p  p2 Use an AsyncTask and wait until the AsyncTask is completed before closing activity two.  However, it appears meaningless to run a seperate thread or an AsyncTask for calculations that should run on the main thread simply to show a ProgressDialog.p  p3 Show the ProgressDialog on the main thread. However, this does not seem to be possible.p  pCould you please point this noob to the right method to show a ProgressDialog while sequentially executing calculations for which the user must wait only a few seconds.p  pThanks,p  pJeanp

But in the Windows emcmd.exeem this works, i.e. the text strongisstrong yellowp  pSo I assume there must be a problem with the interaction between emminttyem and emnpmem.

Negative 1326 pThis is a basic question, but I am very new to SQL and am not sure how to interact with the language. I have an Excel file with a lot of data and was told to run SQL queries on it. I am at a loss of where to start. Where does one download SQL for free and how do I use the commands on Excel data Is this usually where the data in SQL is stored Just confused how the two interact. Thanks.p

Negative 1326 pIm implementing the codeFutureltCollectionltIntegergtgtcode interface in order to share the result of some bulk computation among all thread in the application.p  pIn fact, I intended to just put an instance of a class implemetnting codeFutureltCollectionltIntegergtgtcode into an ApplicationScope object so that any other thread which need the result just ask for the codeFuturecode  from the codeobjectcode and call the method codegetcode on it, therefore using the computation performed by some another thread. p  pMy question is about implementing the codecancelcode method. For now, I would write something like thatp  precodepublic class CustomerFutureImpl implements FutureltCollectionltIntegergtgt      private Thread computationThread     private boolean started     private boolean cancelled     private CollectionltIntegergt computationResult      private boolean cancelboolean mayInterruptIfRunning         if computationResult  null              return false         if started              cancelled  true             return true          else              ifmayInterruptIfRunning                  computationThread.interrupt                    The rest of the methods  codepre  pBut the method implementation doesnt satisfy the documentation of the a hrefhttpdocs.oracle.comjavase7docsapijavautilconcurrentFuture.html relnofollowFuturea because we need to throw codeCancellationExceptioncode in any thread awaiting for the result has called the codegetcode method.p  pShould I add another one field like codeprivate CollectionltThreadgt waitingForTheResultThreadscode and then interrupt each thread from the codeCollectioncode, catch interrupted exception and then codethrow new CancellationExceptioncodep  pThe thing is that such a solution seems kind of wierd to me... Not sure about that.p
