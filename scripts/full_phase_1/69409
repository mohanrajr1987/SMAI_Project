Positive 69409 pI want to make a few subclasses of JavaFXs AnchorPane component but in each case inherit AnchorPanes layout features.

Positive 69409 pIm working on a custom graph modeling component. Ive extended codeRegioncode class and am positioning child nodes using some custom rules.p  pThe problem is that codeRegioncodes layout bounds start from 0, 0 and Id like to change that so that I can add nodes at negative coordinates. I have trouble finding any documentation on how JavaFXs codeNodecode calculates its own bounds.p  pSo how does one overwrite layout bounds of codeRegioncodep
Positive 69409 pThe below code is a simple line chart where the yAxis tick labels are wide in terms of their character lengthwidth.

The p  precodetl.currentTimeProperty.asString codepre  pIs displaying the number as something like 1000.7 ms and 2001 ms, and I would strongly prefer if that wasnt the case. However since the currentTimeProperty is a Property, there are no built in operators like .divide1000 that I can use on it, and I cant bind my label text to the Duration itself, even though it does have the .divide1000 method. Is there something Im missing here or should I approach this an entire new way Thanks.p

Positive 69409 pMaking progress with my board game, so on a mouse click, some tasks will be performed like playing some animations, receiving new panes for the board I asked about this my last question, works great now, making changes to player data etc.p  pSo, here is my EventHandlerp  precodegrid.setOnMouseReleasednew EventHandlerltMouseEventgt       public void handleMouseEvent me          make changes to player data         receive new panes for the board         make some gui changes         play some animations       codepre  pHere codegridcode is a GridPane object, which contains other panes for each cell of the board, panes for animation etc.p  pOne mouse event would take 23 seconds to be handled. While this is going on, I saw that another mouse click would also start being handled parallel with the one already ongoing.p  pWhat I want is that another mouse event should not be processed until the first one has been completed. It would be better if, any clicks if received would be discarded.p  pI tried to use threadingp  precodegrid.setOnMouseReleasednew EventHandlerltMouseEventgt       public void handleMouseEvent me          Thread t  new Threadnew Runnable              public void run                  completing the necessary tasks here                               t.start         t.join       codepre  pBut GUI changes would not occur if I use threading dont know why, I tested it in many different ways, always failed to make GUI changes, so this would not work I guess.p  pSo what could I do to not take in any mouse clicks while one mouse event is being handled I think this question doesnt require more code, but if necessary, I would edit and add some code.p  pEDITp  precodeclass Animations      public Pane getAnimationPane          returns Pane which would be used for transition           public void playAnimation          called only when the timeline transition is to be played       codepre  pSo I made an array of the Animations class because I need a lot of such panes and need to keep a track of each one of them.p  pWhen I need to play the animation, I call the codeplayAnimationcode method.p  pNow this codeplayAnimationcode method is like an animationinception.p  pAfter an animation on this pane is completed, changes are made to the board according to the players progress, and if required... this codeplayAnimationcode method would call the codeplayAnimationcode method of several other Animation objects.p  precodegrid.setOnMouseReleasednew EventHandlerltMouseEventgt       public void handleMouseEvent me          make changes to player data         receive new panes for the board         make some gui changes         play some animations         someAnimationObject.playAnimation       codepre  pThis could go as deep as 1020 more, if the grid size is large other Animation objects being used for their codeplayAnimationcode.p  pEDIT 2p  pThe codeplayAnimationcode of codeAnimationscode could call codeplayAnimationcode on 08 other Animations objects.

Negative 69409 pI have two related question regarding Scrum.p  pOur company is trying to implement it and sure we are jumping over hoops.p  pBoth question are about done means Donep  p1 Its really easy to define Done for tasks which arehave  clear test acceptance criterias  completely standalone   tested at the end by testersp  pWhat should be done with tasks like  architecture design  refactoring  some utility classes developmentp  pThe main issue with it, that its almost completely internal entity  and there is no way to checktest it from outside.p  pAs example feature implementation is kind of binary  its done and passes all test cases or its not done dont pass some test cases.p  pThe best thing which comes to my head is to ask another developer to review that task. However, its any way doesnt provide a clear way to determine is it completely done or not.p  pSo, the question is how do you define Done for such internal tasksp  p2 Debugbugfix taskp  pI know that agile methodology doesnt recommend to have big tasks. At least if task is big, it should be divided on smaller tasks.p  pLet say we have some quite large problem  some big module redesign to replace new outdate architecture with new one. Sure, this task is divided on dozens of small tasks. However, I know that at the end we will have quite long session of debugfix. p  pI know thats usually the problem of waterfall model. However, I think its hard to get rid of it especially for quite big changes.p  pShould I allocate special task for debugfixsystem integrations  and etcp  pIn the case, if I do so, usually this task is just huge comparing to everything else and its kind of hard to divide it on smaller tasks.p  pI dont like this way, because of this huge monolith task.p  pThere is another way. I can create smaller tasks associated with bugs,  put them in backlog, prioritize and add them to iterations at the end of activity, when I will know what are the bugs.p  pI dont like this way, because in such case the whole estimation will became fake. We estimate the task, mark it ask complete at any time. And we will open the new tasks for bugs with new estimates. So, we will end up with actual time  estimate time, which is definitely not good.p  pHow do you solve this problemp  pRegards, Victorp

Negative 69409 pI am building a text parser using regular expressions. I need to convert all tab characters in a string to space characters. I cannot assume how many spaces a tab should encompass otherwise I could replace a tab with, say, 4 space characters. Is there any good solution for this type of problem. I need to do this in code so I cannot use an external tool.p  hr  pUnfortunately, none of these answers address the problem with which I am encountered. I am extracting text from external text files and I cannot assume how they were created or which operating system was used to create them. I believe the length of the tab character can vary so if I encounter a tab when I am reading the text file, I want to know how many space characters I should replace it with.p
Negative 69409 pI am using the built in functionality to define a splash screen using vb.net in VS2008. In Me.Startup, Im calling a function which does a DB version check, then updates if required.  This function then writes to a label, using an invoke if required to write the status. Everything functions fine, all the DB updates complete, but the splash screen just never disappears afterwards.  Its there while the updates are running, and when the last code has executed, the main form appears as expected, but the splash screen is still in the background. When I close the main form, the splash screen keeps running. Ive tried adding code to manually close the splash screen form when the code has run, but to no effect. Thoughtsp

Negative 69409 pI have been a Java programmer for the last 6 years, and since the beginning of this year I got interested in game programming. So, I thought it was a good idea to start with a popular game and I implemented the game Ms. PacMan in Java.

Negative 69409 pIm having a problem with conflicting namespaces and code that gets autogenerated by the forms designer in Visual Studio 2008.

Obviously, the compiler tries to look for the class System.Windows.Forms.Form in namespace Foobar.System.Windows.Formsp  pI have been able to solve this by using the alias x instead of global when referencing to the assembly Foo.dll, and declaring extern alias x in my code files, and put x in front of every reference to types and classes in the namespace Foobar.System. The code compiles.p  pBut it seems that the forms designer dont recognise this, and gives me an error when trying to display the form. This, again, can be solved by manually putting global in front of every reference to classes in System.Windows.Forms e.g. globalSystem.Windows.Forms.Button, but every time chances are made to the form, the code is automaticaly regenerated, and the global part is removed.p  pSo, the question is Is there a way to make the forms designer aware of the alias x that is used to reference my assembly Foo.dll, or is there another, better solution to this Renaming the namespace Foobar.System to something else is just too much work.p

Negative 69409 pI have been using Selenium a lot lately testing an ExtJs app and while in many ways it is wonderful, there are three things that cause me a lot of griefp  ol lipstrongInability to directly click on elementsstrong other than buttons. This has led me to write a bunch of Robot code to move the mouse around. That works but is a bit fragile, plus if you touch your mouse while a test is running, you are screwed. I tried the Selenium forums to see if there was a better way, and got nowhere. I think but am not sure that this is a fundamental limitation of Seleniums JS injection technique.pli lipstrongInability in many cases to control what the id attribute get sets tostrong. This happens inside ExtJs and some elements let you set it, some dont, and some do but the attribute ends up where you dont expect it. You end up having to use XPath in some cases. Using XPath with ExtJs is kind of horrible as ExtJs creates massive levels of nested DIVs. You can also sometimes use CSS locators which are also inconsistently controllable in ExtJs. BTW, this is obviously not a Selenium problem per se.pli lipstrongThe time that Selenium takes to fire up FF is too longstrong... way longer than a normal human FF startup, about 2 seconds per test, which translates into tests that last several minutes, way too long.pli ol  pI briefly looked at Watij, BadBoy and a couple of other web functional testing apps but none of them looked anywhere near as good as Selenium. The way Selenium tests can be written in Java and run through jUnit is really, really sweet.

Negative 69409 pI have a bunch of rowviews that I want to put in a vertical scroll view. I have created this rowView view as a separate nib in IB. They are sized at 1024200 ipad. Now I want to put them one by one in my parent UIScrollView. I tried a simple [vScroll addSubviewrowView] but this puts them overtop of eachother I made the rowview transparent to check this. So then I started fooling with the bounds of each rowview to no avail. This is my code. Note self.yExtentSoFar is initialised to 0. Imagine the code below called for each rowp  precode            MyRowView rowView  [[MyRowView alloc] init]      float calculatedWidth  0      minus nav bar     float calculatedHeight  0     [[UIDevice currentDevice] beginGeneratingDeviceOrientationNotifications]     UIInterfaceOrientation orientation  [UIDevice currentDevice].orientation     if orientation  UIInterfaceOrientationPortrait          iPad         calculatedWidth   768.0         calculatedHeight  960.0     else          iPad         calculatedWidth   1024.0         calculatedHeight  704.0           [self.vScroll addSubview rowView.view]     [rowView.view setBoundsCGRectMake0, self.yExtentSoFar, calculatedWidth,200]     [self.vScroll setContentSizeCGSizeMakecalculatedWidth, yExtentSoFar200]     self.yExtentSoFar  200 codepre  pSo before I tried settings bounds the rowviews appeared overtop of each other. Understandable I guess. When I set the bounds, the 2nd row view hasnt appeared under the 1st as expected, instead I have to pull down the vScroll and the 2nd has appeared ABOVE the first off screenp  pCould someone point to where Im going wrong Thanks a lot,p  pMikep

Negative 69409 pI need to know if I am going about something the right way.p  pFor a given page, I am instantiating an object for the page itself. Lets call that object myPage. Within the page I have containers usually div tags. When I go to an admin component to work with a specific div, I instantiate an object for that as well. Lets call that myDiv.p  pNow, one of the things I want to work with for a given div is the styling of that div. So normally I would think that Id just put in some stylerelated methods, such as myDiv.getPadding or myDiv.getBackgroundColor, etc.p  pBut it occurs to me that I may eventually have other objects for which I may also need to do stylerelated stuff.p  pGiven this, should I then create a separate style.cfc Would that then be extended by the div object Or would the style object extend the div object My understanding is that the more specific object extends the less specific one, but I am not sure which is more specific in this case is it the div object, which references a specific div, or the style object, which provides a specific set of datap  pThanks in advancep

Negative 69409 pI apologize in advance if this is a duplicate, Iv searched for hours and cant find anything.  p  pIm attempting to connect to a SOAPbased web service that provides a WSDL via a Java specifically Tomcat application.  Ive done this in .Net before and it couldnt have been easier.  I simply clicked Add Web Reference and pointed it to the WSDL and it generated all of the stubs and marshalingunmarshaling code for me.  Ive heard of XJC and that seems promising although I cant seem to find anything recent about it everything is from 2002ish and seems to have broken links galore.  I found one tutorial where they manually generated the SOAP XML but that just seems so much more inefficient than it needs to be.  Will XJC do what Im looking for That is, generate the class stubs along with code to marshal and unmarshal my requests If so, can you suggest a tutorialdocumentationp  pThanks in advancep

Negative 69409 pGreetings,p  pIve worked on quite a few apps now that are using the MVC pattern be it in Rails or .Net and I always see a bit of private methods being added inside the controller class.  These private methods are really knowing the how do validate something or the how to create a view model to a domain model.  It seems to me that this logic is leaking and should be placed inside helpers or into the domain model itself.  I always liked the phrase A controller should know what to do, but now how to do it. and it seems adding a bunch of private methods to the class breaks this.p  pIm hoping someone has some useful insight into the matter.p  pThanksp

Negative 69409 pRecently I got access to run my codes on a cluster. My code is totally paralleizable but I dont know how to best use its parallel nature. Ive to compute elements of a big matrix and each of them are independent of the others. I want to submit the job to run on several machine like 100 to speed up the computation of the matrix.p  pRight now, I wrote a script to submit multiple jobs each responsible to compute a part of the matrix and save it in a .mat file. At the end Im merging them to get the whole matrix. For submitting each individual job, Ive created a new .m file run1.m, run.2, ... to set a variable and then run the function to compute the associated part in the matrix. So basically run1.m isp  precodeid1computedistsmatrix codepre  pand then computedistsmatrix uses id to find the part it is going to compute. Then I wrote a script to create run1.m through run60.m and the qsub them to the cluster.p  pI wonder if there is a better way to do this using some MATLAB features for example. Because this seems to be a very typical task.p

Negative 69409 pSo I have two problems but both are related.p  ol lipI created a animation that moves a progress view when a button is clicked by using codeNSTimercode. This animation works fine the first couple times the button is clicked but after that it starts speeding up the process, practically skipping from the initial start of the codeNSTimercode loop to the end of the codeNSTimercode loop. I was wondering if anyone has ever heard of this issue andor knows a solutionpli lipI created the same thing in question 1 but in a codeUItableViewCellcode and the codeNSTimercode loop is activated when the edit button is pressed.

Negative 69409 pIve got an admittedly strange trycatch block that checks if a codeFilecode exists. If it doesnt, then I create it and write a codeFilecode to it. Then I read the codeFilecode. p  pI have an codeArrayListcode that is being initialized by reading an object from an codeObjectInputStreamcode.

If I simply remove the calls to codeclosecode, everything goes as planned.p  pThis seems backwards to me. I would think that the file system is somehow locked if Ive got some type of codestreamcode open to it. Thats why I thought to close the codeoutputStreamscode before using an codeinputStreamcode.

But passwords have to be retrieved in clear text at some point and hashing is NOT an option   Even if the service would let me pass the password hash that would kinda defeat the purpose because the hash would be as good as a password Pp

Negative 69409 pFirst off, I am a complete noob, so please be gentle when explaining.  I have a program that loads a webpage UIWebview on the first view controller.  The first view controller checks to see if the NSUserDefaults contains jdoe1234 for the UserName.  If it does, it loads the first webpage, if it has something different, it loads a second webpage.  I also have an information button that flips to the second view controller.p  pOn the second view controller, a person can type in a username and password and click the Done button which flips them back to the first controller view.  Inside the done button code, I am updating the NSUserDefaults to include the username and password textbox values.  p  pMy problem is when the person flips back to the first view controller, the webpage is not refreshing with the values that the person just typed in and saved.

Negative 69409 pIm having a trouble overloading operator [] for both read and write in my objects.

However, the second one which should supposedly be called when reading does not work and the code crashes. Im not sure what is happening here but when I comment out the first one it just works fine Could it be that compiler somehow confuses the two since they are both inlinep  pAny thought would be appreciated.p  pEDIT Ok here is the SetterProxy itselfp  precodeclass SetterProxy private     Vec v     int i     double ptrval public     inline SetterProxyVec v, int i          v  v         i  i         VecGetArrayv,ampptrval          inline SetterProxy         VecRestoreArrayv,ampptrval           inline void operatordouble rhs          ptrval[i]  rhs       codepre  pAlthough I dont think its coming directly from that. Also initially I had it to return by value and I though changing it to reference would be more efficient.

Negative 69409 pstrongFortranstrong There are two large arrays of integers, the goal is to find out if they have any number in common or not, stronghowstrongbr You may consider that both are in the same size case 1 or in different sizes case 2.

Negative 69409 pI am inserting rows into a table from a Powershell script. I loop through a collection of PSObjects property bags and inserts a row for each one. Each noteProperty on the PSObject corresponds to a column in the table. Most of them are strings, a few are dates, and a few are booleans.p  pProperties that have a null value in Powershell are being inserted as blank strings and not NULL in the table, however. null date values show up as 19000101. The table does not have any constraints beyond a couple of columns having NOT NULL specified. If I do a manual insert with NULL as a value, it works fine.p  pI could loop over each object looking for null properties and then replace it with the string NULL, but that seems like a hack instead of the right way. As you can see below, Im already doing this for the booleans, as their corresponding columns in the table are bits. I erroneously assumed that null in Powershell would translate to NULL in SQL.

Negative 69409 pSomeone edit the title if you can understand and define my problem better.p  pThe problem which I am having is with style formatting of a RichEdit reverting back to the default nothing aka code[]code and then back to whatever I set it to, bold or italic for example.p  pThe thing that is at fault  I assum, since I have no idea how it is breaking things  is a procedure REMainLinesCheck that checks for amount of lines in the RichEdit and deletes the first one until a certain point is reached to show a maximum of 14 lines at once like sop  precodewhile REMain.Lines.Count gt 14 do   REMain.Lines.Delete0  codepre  pI have 6 occurrences of the above procedure in other procedures that add lines to the RichEdit, but none of them change codeRichEdit.SelAttributes.Stylecode but one, which was adding only one Bold line like sop  precodeREMain.SelAttributes.Style  [fsBold] REMain.Lines.Addsomething REMainLinesCheck codepre  pSo I have removed all occurrences except that one and started poking around, it didnt take long to see that it was working in fact fine, regular and bold lines where being added normally and excess lines where being deleted  no problems. But as soon as I reintroduced REMainLinesCheck procedure into another procedure for clarity purposes, lets call it Proc3Lines, because thats what it does adds 3 lines and then calls the check for excess lines, every line that follows this Proc3Lines that should be Bold is not... From what I have experienced here it seems that REMainLinesCheck does something in Proc3Lines, since without it everything is fine.p  pObviously its not a circle of procedures that call each other, but the other parts of the code have nothing to do with this RichEdit, not to mention that I dont change codeRichEdit.SelAttributes.Stylecode anywhere for REMain except that one place that I have shown, there is another RichEdit in the same unit that I do change its lines style like that, but that cannot possibly be related in any way... could it No it doe not, I just checked.p  pBasically what the hell Delphi It cannot get any simpler than this and I am still managing to fail, can someone explain andor fix this Ask questions, Ill elaborate as much as I can if something is not clear.p

This way this is not rendered on views that do not need it. It is different from the concept of section in which the content is defined in the view, rather it says I want this feature added to the layout and the layout would output some predefined markup that would enable that feature AND that in several places of the view there might be nuggets that require that feature support markup or script. If I use a section, then that common script would appear multiple times which is not what I need.p  pHaving said that, How can I access a custom helper defined in the base view page from within a controllerp

Negative 69409 pIm developing a website that uses Comet to transmit data back to web clients. My application is very time sensitive, I have a graph displaying points added every second.p  pSince the web application is Comet driven there is no real need for the client to handle dates, it should only use the server timestamp to display information. i.e. a plotted point on the graph should display in the tooltip the server timestamp, regardless of the users timezone.p  pI think my best approach would be to retrieve the servers timestamp using REST. Then measure the timezone offset between the server and client time, adddeduct the difference and use it as the clients timestamp for display purposes.p  pIs there a way to override the default behavior of codenew Datecode to result in me having the servers timestamp as the localp  pMany thanks.p

Negative 69409 pWeve got some pretty complex code thats utilising the drag and drop functionality provided by the YUI JavaScript library. Weve recently ported the app to be more iPad  mobile friendly, however were having some problems with the touch events, and the drag and drop functionality offered in YUI. More specifically were using codeYUI 2.7.0code which doesnt explicitly offer touch support for the drag and drop library.p  pAfter doing some research I discovered that codeYUI 3.xcode emdoesem offer support, however were reluctant to upgrade due to the significant number of changes. We also feel that if we were to upgrade we would probably consider porting all of the YUI stuff to jQuery.p  pIve tried using a hrefhttpstackoverflow.coma6362527259656the fix detailed herea to register the touch events, and it seems to work to some extend.

Negative 69409 pI have a sitewide include file that I include in pages in the main directory.  However, I have put a bunch of pages with a common theme in a subdirectory.  These pages need to reference the same include file.  I am now running into problems with relative links in the include file for things like images since they call different paths depending on whether the main file is in the main directory or a subdirectory.  For example, the link codeimagespic.jpgcode will work if the include is called from the main directory but will try to go to codesubimagespic.jpgcode if the include is called from the subdirectory.p  pI had solved this by using hard links that go back to the root as in codeimagespic.jpgcode.  However, Id rather not use hard links as they may break if the site is moved to another directory etc.p  pDo all your pages calling a given include have to be in the same directory  Or is there some technique to get relative links in the include to work, even if the include is called from a subdirectoryp  pMany thanks.p

That might be right for some situations, but not all.  emFor instance Im specifically trying to write a container that can hold types that may or may not be copyconstructible, and I need to flip methods on and off based on that.emp  pAs a workaround, I gave this a shot...which appears to work correctly.p  precodeinclude lttypetraitsgt  using namespace std  template lttypename Tgt struct FooPointerBase      void validifpointerT const     template lttypename Tgt struct FooNonPointerBase      void validifnotpointerT const     template lttypename Tgt struct Foo  public conditionallt     ispointerltTgtvalue,      FooPointerBaseltTgt,     FooNonPointerBaseltTgt gttype    int mainint argc, char  argv[]      int someInt  1020 if DEMONSTRATEERRORCASES     Fooltintgt.validifnotpointerampsomeInt     Fooltintgt.validifpointer304 else     Fooltintgt.validifpointerampsomeInt     Fooltintgt.validifnotpointer304 endif     return 0  codepre  pBut if this is not broken emis item, its certainly not following a good general methodology for how to turn on and off methods in a templated class based on sniffing the type for traits.

Negative 69409 pIm pretty new to IOS development. Let me explain my problem first.p  pIn Adobe Flash, there is an mouse event that enables me to detect mouse enter to a movieclip.

Negative 69409 pIm creating an expandable listview that contains a restaurant menu.

Also only a single row gets selected when I click, which is nice.p  pMy only problem is I cant get the holder to remember the status of the viewflipper when I scroll. So it resets every time I scroll.p  pFor example, in the steak example, if I show the detail view in the row, then scroll down and back up, the view in the row returns to the name avocado roll.

The issue here is that the button resides in the separate codeUIViewcode. One way to do this is pass the codeUIViewcode the information once they are set, which in turn would be passed to the codeMapViewControllercode once the button is tapped. The problem here would be the delegate as the delegate needs to return to the codeInputViewControllercode and not the UIView.p  pI was wondering if its possible to move the codeUIViewcode into the codeInputViewControllercode, including the codedrawRectcode method for that view. If so, how can I do that If not, what are other wayssuggestions I can do to have the above set upp

In the code sample there, apparently an operator spelled codegtgtcode is used on a pointer to a codestructcode. I cant find it in any operator precedence tables Ive found, so I am wondering, is or was it ever an operator, and if so, what does or did, as the case may be this operator dop  pAt first I thought it was a typo, but it is reproduced twice more in the text and another time in the code sample in the response to the question, and I have a hard time believing it just slipped past at least two C experts without being noticed, when it jumped out at a novice like me. Its also at the focal point of the code, very easy to notice, and was never corrected.p  pHere is the code with added indentationp  precodeinclude ltstdlib.hgt  struct A      char x[1]   main      struct A p  struct A  mallocsizeofstruct A  100     pgtgtx[5]     This is the key line [for both them and us]      return 0  codepre  pI tried to compile this code with both a C and C compiler and it failed to parse in either one. Perhaps this was some operator in an early version of C that isnt used any morep  pThis feels suspiciously like the a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions1642028whatisthenameofthisoperatorWhat is the name of this operator a question, but I dont think this is a combination of two other operators, I dont see how it can be divided up and be valid.p

Negative 69409 pI am building a website that will be handling many persistent connections  either through long polling or WebSockets if I get a host that has IIS8. My question is, are either of these viable on a shared host Or do I need a true dedicated server p  pI understand that longpolling will require me to do some custom configuration on the maximum number of requests handled by the server.. so it seems like this is not an option on a shared host. What about WebSockets And, will either of these work with virtual or cloud hostingp

Negative 69409 pI have a global variable in a Sinatra application that I want to update with a scheduled task from my Rakefile. Note that the application is hosted on Heroku. I have set up helpers in order to access this variable.p  precodeget  do     var end  helpers do     def getvar         return var     end      def setvarvalue         var  value     end end codepre  pHere is the task in my Rakefilep  precodetask dosomething do     SinatraApplication.setvargetdata end  def getdata      Retrieve value from external source     ...     return val end codepre  pThe problem I run into is that the task executes properly, but the variable in the Sinatra application is never updated. I assume this is because calling codeSinatraApplicationcode from within the Rakefile actually creates a separate instance of the application from the primary instance that I am trying to update.p  pI want to know if their is a way to access the scope of the running Sinatra web app from within a Rakefile task.p  pNote I could just write the value retrieved in the scheduled task to a database and then access it from the Sinatra app, but that would be overkill because this variable is updated so infrequently but retrieved so regularly that I would prefer to keep it in memory for easier access. I have looked into Memcache and Redis in order to avoid turning to a database, but again I feel that this would be excessive for a single value. Feel free to disagree with this.p  pEDIT In regards to Alexey Sukhoviys comment, Heroku does not allow writing to files outside of the tmp directories, and these are not kept alive long enough to satisfy the needs of the application.p
Negative 69409 pI have to solve a 2D Poisson equation using a predictorcorrector scheme. The equation must be solved on a codenmcode nonuniform grid. Predictorcorrector scheme means that the solution codexcode at a step codek1code is obtained by summing the solution at a step codekcode and a codedeltacode value. The codedeltacode value is obtained by solving a system of linear equations, which is something likep  pAxk  delta  bxkp  pBy applying the finite difference method, the matrix codeAcode has code5code nonnull diagonals the main one, the ones immediately above and below and two further above and below separated by coden1code zerodiagonals from the other diagonals. Being nonuniform, codeAcode is clearly nonsymmetric. Also, the main diagonal of codeAcode and the vector codebcode will be changed according the old solution. Now, Id like to solve this problem using a parallel algorithm, since finding codedeltacode for big grids can be really expensive. Any ideas As for now, Im trying the Jacobi method.p  pI believe I have two possible paths I can stick to direct and sequential methods or use an iterative method. If I choose the latter then I have to use Jacobis method if I want to exploit parallelism. Do you know other parallel methods If I choose the former, do you know if there is an algorithm that exploits the fact that I have exactly code5code nonzero diagonals What about Thomas algorithm for block matricesp

I thought that I could craft a RewriteRule that would rewrite the http portion of the query string into something could get past Apaches rules. p  pThis will eventually be installed on a clients machine so I cant change any server settings. p  pAn example URL would be p  precodehttpmysite.comgocardlessconfirm.phpresourceurihttps3A2F2Fsandbox.gocardless.com2Fapi2Fv12Fbills2F07F56ERHRT codepre  pHeres the settings I was trying to use p  precodeRewriteCond QUERYSTRING .resourceurihttp.

Negative 69409 pI have a web site that exists on one page index.html. There is a lot of content on the site that appears to be on many pages but via javascript and CSS, all the info is contained on index.html.p  pSo there exists a home position and an inside position like a home page and inside page, and I need some links to behave differently when the user is on an inside page vs the home page. So the way I have it set up, once an inside link is clicked, I remove a class from a div that I emthinkem should cause the links within that div to behave differently. But they are emnotem behaving as I expect.p  pThe page, very dumbed down for this example, is herep  pa hrefhttplittleduck.comnssampleindex.html relnofollowhttplittleduck.comnssampleindex.htmlap  pOn this example, there is just the home page and the Services page. You can link back and forth between them.p  pIf you mouseover those grey links on the left which are called balloons in the code, you will see that they have a hover color, and a popup graphic appears. I ONLY want this to happen when the page is in the home position. I have a class called popupyes that allows this hoverpopup action to happen. It appears when index.html is loaded, and if I remove it or change its name in the code, the hoverpopup does not work. So I know that class is doing something. Now, I REMOVE that class when Services is clicked. I can see by inspecting the element in Chrome that popupyes DOES in fact get removed. HOWEVER ... the hoverpopup action still happens when you mouseover the balloons.p  pAnd when I inspect the element, even though you can see in the code that popupyes is gone, it is still being utilized by Chrome. Here is a screenshot of what Inspect Element looks like on the home and inside pagesp  pa hrefhttpi.stack.imgur.comp1ZP7.jpg relnofollowhttpi.stack.imgur.comp1ZP7.jpgap  pSo, please tell me where my brain is derailing. How can I get the hoverpopup action to NOT WORK when Im on the Services page Thank you incredibly much for any help you can provide.p

When I looked at the cocos2d transitions, the scene transitions for zooming dont seem to have any artifacts.  Everything just looks crisp  I was wondering if thats because the UIView is already that size and they start out the view at the smaller size so when it zooms to the larger size it doesnt receive unwanted artifacts.  Or if theres something they do in opengl or something that makes it look crisp.  I do not know opengl so if that question is totally wrong I apologize  Thanks.p

Negative 69409 pI have been doing a lot of searching, and I dont think Ive really found what I have been looking for.  I will try my best to explain what I am trying to do, and hopefully there is a simple solution, and Ill be glad to have learned something new.  p  pstrongThis is ultimately what I am trying to accomplishstrong  Using nosetests, decorate some test cases using the attribute selector plugin, then execute test cases that match a criteria by using the a switch during commandline invocation.  The attribute values for the tests that are executed are then stored in an external location.  The command line call Im using is like belowp  precodenosetests testpath a attributesomeValue codepre  pI have also created a customized nosetest plugin, which stores the test cases attributse, and writes them to an external location.  The idea is that I can select a batch of tests, and by storing the attributes of these tests, I can do filtering on these results later for reporting purposes.  I am accessing the method attributes in my plugin by overriding the wantMethod method with the code similar to the followingp  precodedef setattribsself, method, attribute     if hasattrmethod, attribute         if not self.methodattributes.haskeymethod.name             self.methodattributes[method.name]            self.methodattributes[method.name][attribute]  getattrmethod, attribute  def wantMethodself, method     self.setattribsmethod, attribute1     self.setattribsmethod, attribute2     pass codepre  pI have this working for pretty much all the tests, except for one case, where the test is uing the yield keyword.  What is happening is that the methods that are generated are being executed fine, but then the method attributes are empty for each of the generated functions.p  pBelow is the example of what I am trying to achieve.  The test below retreives a list of values, and for each of those values, yields the results from another functionp  precodeattrattribute1someValue, attribute2anotherValue def sampletestgeneratorself     for key, value in inputdictionary.items         f  partialself.dotest, key, value         f.attribute1someValue         yield lambda x f, key  def dotestself, input1, input2      Some code codepre  pFrom what I have read, and think I understand, when yield is called, it would create a new callable function which then gets executed.  I have been trying to figure out how to retain the attribute values from my sampletestgenerator method, but I have not been successful.  I thought I could create a partial method, and then add the attribute to the method, but no luck.  The tests execute without errors at all, it just seems that from my plugins perspective, the method attributes arent present, so they dont get recorded.p  pI realize this a pretty involved question, but I wanted to make sure that the context for what I am trying to achieve is clear.  I have been trying to find information that could help me for this particular case, but I feel like Ive reached a stumbling block now, so I would really like to ask the experts for some advice.p  pThanks.p  p Update p  pAfter reading through the feedback and playing around some more, it looks like if I modified the lambda expression, it would achieve what I am looking for.  In fact, I didnt even need to create the partial functionp  precodedef sampletestgeneratorself     for key, value in inputdictionary.items         yield lambda self.dotest codepre  pThe only downside to this approach is that the test name will not change.  As I am playing around more, it looks like in nosetests, when a test generator is used, it would actually change the test name in the result based on the keywords it contains.  Same thing was happening when I was using the lambda expression with a parameter.p  pFor examplep  ol liUsing lamdba expression with a parameter      yield lambda x self.dotest, value1li ol  pIn nosetests plugin, when you access the test case name, it would be displayed as sampletestgeneratorvalue1p  ol liUsing lambda expression without a parameter     yield lambda self.dotestli ol  pThe test case name in this case would be sampletestgenerator.  In my example above, if there are multiple values in the dictionary, then the yield call would occur multiple times.  However, the test name would always remain as sampletestgenerator.  This is not as bad as when I would get the unique test names, but then not be able to store the attribute values at all.  I will keep playing around, but thanks for the feedback so farp  h2EDITh2  pI forgot to come back and provide my final update on how I was able to get this to work in the end, there was a little confusion on my part at first, and after I looked through it some more, I figured out that it had to do with how the tests are recognizedp  pMy original implementation assumed that every test that gets picked up for execution goes through the wantMethod call from the plugins base class.  This is not true when yield is used to generate the test, because at this point, the test method has already passed the wantMethod call.p  pHowever, once the test case is generated through the yeild call, it does go through the startTest call from the plugin base class, and this is where I was finally able to store the attribute successfully.  p  pSo in a nut shell, my test execution order looked like thisp  blockquote   pnose  wantMethodmethodname  yield  startTestyieldedtestnamep blockquote  pIn my override of the startTest method, I have the followingp  precodedef startTestself, test      If a test is spawned by using the yield keyword, the test names would be the parent test name, appended by the  character      example  If the parent test is smoketest, the generated test from yield would be smoketestinput     parenttestname  testname.split[0]      if self.methodattributes.haskeytestname         self.testattrib  self.methodattributes[testname]     elif self.methodattributes.haskeyparenttestname         self.testattrib  self.methodattributes[parenttestname]     else         self.testattrib  None codepre  pWith this implementation, along with my overide of wantMethod, each test spawned by the parent test case also inherits attributes from the parent method, which is what I needed.p  pAgain, thanks to all who send replies.  This was quite a learning experience.p

Negative 69409 pI have a fairly simple script to write I have to total all of the international calling costs for my organization. I have two tables the phonelog table, and the rates table. p  pThe solution Ive settled on is simplep  pselect the destination country code and the call duration from the phone log tablep  pselect from the rates table the cost per minute using the destination country code that i just selected p  pthen multiply the duration and the cost per minute CPM, for every international call, and add it to a variable named total, which is at the end displayed to the user.p  pNow, were I able to write this in whatever I wanted, I would be able to do this in about 30 mins. However, Ive been told I have to write the great majority of it in SQL.p  pSo Ive googled a bit and settled on using a stored procedure, sop  pHow would I traverse the results of the first select query If this were in ColdFusion or PHP, I would simply put the results in an array  but I havent found a way to insert the results of one query into an array in SQL.p  pSecond is there a way to condense these stepsp  pfor examplep  precodetotal  0 select destinationareacode, duration from phonelogs, where destinationinternational  for each record, select CPM from rates, where areacode  record.destinationareacode  totalCPMduration60 codepre  pAnd then the total gets displayed to the user.p  pAnyways...to clarify my questionsp  pHow do I traverse through a set of query results Is it possible to do another query while traversing those results, using the results themselves areacode as conditions in that queryp  pSorry if all this seems convoluted, Im not sure how else to phrase my questions. p

Negative 69409 pI was wondering whether the database connection gets closed after the request is completed in symfony 2 application. Does symfony 2 handles the closing of database connection by calling close function of doctrine or symfony does not deal with the closing at all. I have walked over many tutorials of symfony 2 but never found that they manually close the database connection. So should I have to manually close the database connection after the request is completed  I also found out that doctrine uses persistent connection. Does that mean i dont have to worry about closing database connection. How does doctrine 2 handle the closing operation  If I have large number of requests, I will be left with many open connections.Could somebody explain to me for the case when there could be many concurrent users logging into my site p

Negative 69409 pI am using a Python application to access my Google Contacts and retrieve their information. My current problem, however, is not of programming, its conceptual.p  pI noticed that in the past fields like the cell phone and home address were part of the Google Contact. However, it seems that now the Google Contacts only contain emailgroups, and all the extra information such as cell phone and address is part of the Google Plus profile.p  pTherefore, I am assuming that in order to obtain someones full contact information, including phone number and address, I need to use the Google Plus API and not the Google Contacts API. Would this be a fair assumptionp  pThank youp
Negative 69409 pIve been searching solutions for my enterprise apps, at least 3 platforms need to be supported, which are iOS, Android and Window Phone. After a whole days search, I finally set my eyes on 2 promising cross platform solutions, one is monocross and the other phonegap. monocross seems to use c and .net at all, is it possible to access native libraries and languages I read somewhere its compiled directly into binaries that can execute on target platforms. And about phonegap, it uses webviews on each platform to provide the capabilities of presenting user interfaces to final users. As its implemented via interpreted language and high level apis, the performance may not meet our needs. Finally, wemy team decide to give it a try with mono, the architecture is illustrated as bellowp  prepresentation layerbr [monotouch,monodroid,silverlight]or [native gui calls] or [html5jscss]br brp  prepresentation controllerbusiness logic layerbr [                                 monoc                       ] br br server sidebr [                                 the cloud                     ]  p  pI want to use monoc to write some common purpose business logic and data structures, and when it comes to some common platform features, like storage service, notifications, Id like to wrap them up on each platform and expose uniform apis for cbusiness logic layer to use. As to the representation layer, we decide to choose from the 3 optional solutions listed above.p  pTo make this happening, first I have to figure out if it is possible to call native frameworks. So, my questions arebr 1, How does mono work, I mean, are the c codes compiled into binaries that can be executed directly on iOS, Android and Windows Phone br 2, Is there a mechanism to make native invocations Like in cocos2dx, I can call java methods via JNI, and in iOS, c can call oc directly. Can I call cocoa touch stuffs in mono with cbr 3, Is it possible to manage all these stuffs in one single project, and how to build thembr 4, Are there any better solutionsbrp  pAny suggestions will be appreciated, thanks for your patiencep

Negative 69409 pIve seen parts of this question asked a few time, but I have specific questions that I cant find an answer to.p  pI have written a simple iPhone app, and would like to test it on my own device. However, I dont currently own a device so am in the market for a used iPhone 3GS or iPod touch 4thGen.p  pIf I go for the iPhone my preferred option does it matter if i it has no contract ii it is locked to ATampT or unlockedp  pCan you restoreupgrade a noncontracted phone to iOS 6 through iTunesp  pFinally, iPhone GPS is my main reason for preferring it over the iPod touch. Does this still work on a noncontracted phone i.e. does it work with wirelessp  pAs I have never owned a smart phone, I apologise if these questions seem a bit dumb. Thanks for the helpp  pEDIT My question is a little vague so to clarify the two main points are  i Can you test apps on a out of contract iPhone with no SIM ii Without 3G, does an iPhone estimate GPS location using wireless or will the GPS api return an error message I think this is answered by Benmjp

I want the second page is the filtered results.p  precode    ltphp      include functions.php     obstart      ifloggedin      headerLocationlogin.php     exit            ifissetPOST[edit]            SESSION[id]POST[id]      headerLocationedit.php            ifissetPOST[BOOK]              SESSION[id]POST[id]     headerLocationbookingedit.php           ifPOST[types]  name  POST[types]  mobile  POST[types]        OccasionType          SESSION[filter]POST[filter]             gt      ltDOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC W3CDTD HTML 4.01 TransitionalEN   httpwww.w3.orgTRhtml4loose.dtdgt     lthtmlgt      ltheadgt     ltmeta httpequivcontenttype contenttexthtmlcharsetUTF8 gt      lttitlegtManorama Party Plotlttitlegt       ltlink hrefcssstyle.css relstylesheet typetextcssgt     ltlink relstylesheet typetextcss hrefcssflexigrid.css mediaall gt      ltscript typetextjavascript srcjsprototype.jsgtltscriptgt         ltscript typetextjavascript srcjsjquery.min.jsgtltscriptgt          ltscript typetextjavascript srcjsjqueryui1.8.16.custom.min.jsgt           ltscriptgt          ltscript typetextjavascriptgt     function       Datepicker         From,To.datepicker     inline true                       hover states on the static widgets                 dialoglink, ulicons li.hover                     function  this.addClassuistatehover ,                      function  this.removeClassuistatehover                                         ltscriptgt                 ltscript typetextjavascriptgt             document.readyfunction              types.changefunction            iftypes.val  InquiryDate  types.val  OccasionDate                      From.show       To.show        filter.hide                       else               filter.show               From.hide      To.hide                                                 ltscriptgt          ltscript typetextjavascript srcjsflexigrid.jsgtltscriptgt        ltheadgt      ltbodygt          ltdiv classwrapper filterwrappergt      ltdiv idheadergt        ltphp include header.php gt     ltdivgt     ltdiv idcontentgtltdivgtltdivgt     ltdiv classfilltercongt      ltdiv classflexigrid filltergt              ltdiv classpDivgt                 ltdiv classpDiv2 axportgt                 lth2gtFilter lth2gt             ltform actionltphp echo SERVER[PHPSELF] gt methodpost nameformfiltergt         ltselect classfilterselect idtypes nametypesgt                 ltoption valuenonegtnoneltoptiongt                     ltoption valuenamegtnameltoptiongt                      ltoption valuemobilegtmobileltoptiongt                      ltoption valueOccasionTypegtOccasionTypeltoptiongt                     ltoption valueInquiryDategtInquiryDateltoptiongt                     ltoption valueOccasionDategtOccasionDateltoptiongt               ltselectgt                ltinput classfilterinput namefilter idfilter typetext gt            ltinput typetext classfilterinput idFrom nameFrom styledisplay  none va  lueFrom onblurthis.valuethis.valueFromthis.valuethis.value  onfocusthis.valueFromthis.valuethis.valuethis.value gt            ltinput typetext classfilterinput idTo nameTo styledisplay none valueTo onblurthis.valuethis.valueTothis.valuethis.value onfocusthis.valueTothis.valuethis.valuethis.value gt                     ltinput classfilterbutton typesubmit value  Gogt                  ltformgt                 ltdivgt             ltdivgt         ltdivgt          ltphp          tblnamevisitordetail adjacents  3      ifPOST[types]  name        query  SELECT COUNT as num FROM tblname WHERE    name.SESSION[filter].

Negative 69409 pI was once asked a questionp  pemIf you were given a program with source code, the program goal is to get input from end users for their passwords. It filters out illegal input like number 8, and then stores the input. The source code compiles and runs good for most common input. But it embeds logic errors like overlook some input errors. And might dump under special illegal input. How you decide whether the program contains problem If have, how to solveemp  pCould you think of a good way to test the program Is there any smart tools to test all possible inputs for my program Or smart tools to verify the programp  pI imagine a good way is not modify the code but just runtest the code to find potential problems.p  pPS suppose VS 2012 Cp

Negative 69409 pGreetings Fellow SOFs,p  pMy application has a lot of tables. And each table has 0n number of Enumerators. Everything was going nice and bubbly, then all of a sudden my client now wants to move his data to OracleThey had some native db till then. Now we have managed to create the SQL for the tables that we have but were clueless with the Enumerators.p  pI made a sacrifice to the Lord Internetwhich basically meant me not looking at FB for like 12 hours and found out that for oracle we can use p  precodeColumnName DatatypesizeCheck InltPossible Valuesgt. codepre  pLooking at this closely I found that it would be better if we create tables for enumerators and use those tables as a constraint while inserting values. Something like p  pTable Enumerator has 2 fields ID and Enumerator Valuesp  pTable MyTable has a Name column which will only accept values which are present in the Enumerator Table.            p  pReasons  1. Most of the Enumerators are repeated across different tables. 2. If the client were to update any enumerator table, we dont want them to go back and change all the other table as well.p  pI am looking at other solutions as well. But , I would be grateful to thee wise men if thee could guide me on my journey.p  pFound the Solution to the null Problem as well D... And Now I cna insert either an empty string or any one of the values from the tablep  precodeGOT THE SOLUTION D codepre  pMixed them both i.e CHECK IN as well as Constraint Dp  precodeCREATE TABLE MYTABLE1 ID number11 not null, STATUS varchar212 CheckSTATUS IN,  ltlt  Did the trick, FOREIGN KEYSTATUS REFERENCES MYENUM3VALUES, primary key ID codepre

Negative 69409 pI am a noob and I want to know where put the ajax.py In the dajax documentation they don give you that information. Is it in the codestaticcode folderp
Negative 69409 pI am mostly interested in Java, but I think its a general question. Recently Ive been working with Arquillian framework codeShrinkWrapcode that uses a lot of method chaining. Other example of method chaining are methods in codeStringBuildercode, codeStringBuffercode. There are obvious benefits of using this approach reduced verbosity is one of them. p  pNow I was wondering, why arent all methods which have codevoidcode return parameter implemented as chainable There must be some obvious and objective drawback in chaining. Because if all methods are chainable, I can still choose not to use it. p  pI am not asking to change the existing code in Java, which might break something somewhere, but explanation why wasnt it used would be nice as well. I am more asking from a future framework written in Java design perspective. p  hr  pI have found a similar question, but the original asker is actually wondering why it IS considered a good practice a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions1103985methodchainingwhyisitagoodpracticeornotMethod chaining  why is it a good practice, or notap  hr  pstrongWhile there are some answers available, I am still not sure what are all the benefits and drawbacks of chaining and whether it would be considered useful to have all void methods chainable.strong p

Negative 69409 pI have a Piano app with some round labels on it with the note names. These note names need to be completely centered on the label. I finally figured out how to do that vertically using codeascentcode and codedescentcode. However, I am still not getting the horizontal alignment perfectly ok.p  pIt is mainly about the rendering of single characters. Whatever I do, some of the characters are off. Its slightly, but its there. p  pNotice how the E is slightly off to the right for example, and the B a bit to the left.p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comtN4rb.png altenter image description here img srchttpi.stack.imgur.comysC2P.png altenter image description here img srchttpi.stack.imgur.com9Tb6n.png altenter image description herep  pI am rendering the labels in codeonDrawcode, not with custom views. I also tried with a codeTextViewcode the size of the labels and using codeGravity.CENTERcode, but this gave the same results. Also note that I tried codeAlign.Centercode too.p  pCodep  precodeusedPaint.setTextAlignAlign.LEFT Also tried it with Center Rect textBounds  new Rect usedPaint.getTextBoundsinfoText, 0, infoText.length, textBounds float textWidth  usedPaint.measureTextinfoText canvas.drawTextinfoText, circleX  0.5F  textWidth,  circleY  usedPaint.descent  usedPaint.ascent2,                 usedPaint canvas.drawRectcircleX  0.5F textWidth, circleY  0.5F  textBounds.height, circleX  0.5F  textWidth, circleY  0.5F  textBounds.height, otherPaint codepre  pThe drawn boxs width is the result of codemeasureTextcode. At the codeEcode character you see that somehow it measures some whitespace on the left, making the character drift off to the right.p  pThis is using the standard font on Android 4.0.3. Using a custom TTF font results in the same kind of issues, but different for each character.p  pI am wondering what else I can do Besides getting over it  p

Negative 69409 pAccording to the git commit messages, ServiceStack has recently added failover support. I initially assumed this meant that I could pull one of my Redis instances down, and my pooled client manager would handle the failover elegantly and try to connect with one of my alternate Redis instances. Unfortunately, my code just bugs out and says that it cant connect with the initial Redis instance.p  pI am currently running instances of Redis 2.6.12 on a Windows, with the master at port 6379 and a slave at 6380, with sentinels set up to automatically promote the slave to a master if the master goes down. I am currently instantiating my client manager like thisp  precodePooledRedisClientManager pooledClientManager      new PooledRedisClientManagernew string[1]  localhost6379,         new string[1] localhost6380 codepre  pwhere the first array is readwrite hosts for the master, and the second array is readonly hosts for the slave.p  pWhen I terminate the master at port 6379, the sentinels promote the slave to a master. Now, when I try to run my C code, instead of failing over to port 6380, it simply breaks and returns the error could not connect to redis Instance at localhost6379.p  pIs there a way around this, or will failover simply not work the way I want it top

Negative 69409 pIm trying to create a video with slides next to it using HTML5 and Javascript. The problem with InternetExplorer is that its video networkstate stays on 2 for a while. As long as it is downloading the video, it wont be downloading my slides next to the video.  As a fix I tried pausing the video if the preloaded image isnt loaded on the time it has to pick over the slides spot. But however the video stays downloading Taking about 300 seconds according to the network state And once its done the slides will load directly. Taking 260 seconds according to the same thing, but as soon as the video is loaded they ARE loadedp  pWhen ever I try to use myVideo.networkState in the console I get state 2loading when its not working, and state 1 when it does. So it has something to do with the video.p  pSo the question  Is there a way to either give priority to the slides, so they WILL load Or a way to let IE download both slides and video on the same time. Or giving the video a limited speed, if this has to do with a speed problem.p

Negative 69409 pMy question is pretty specific. Im developing a game in which there is a potion jar that can drop from enemies. The image for the potion jar is a transparent jar with a black border, and an opaque white background. The reason why there is an opaque white background is because I also need to draw how much potion is left in the jar. My current method for doing this isp  ol liDraw a rectangle of height H that signifies how much potion is leftli liDraw the potion jar image on top of the rectangle.li ol  pThus, this will overlap the ugly red rectangle drawn to signify the amount of potion remaining with the opaque white space around the potions transparent area. Here is an image of the resultp  pa hrefhttpi.imgur.comj7ydEBF.png relnofollowhttpi.imgur.comj7ydEBF.pngap  pThe problem arises because the potion jar really does look pretty bad in game. The white background just looks horrible.p  pMy question is Is there any way to remove that opaque white background, while still being able to fill the potion jar exactly in the space that the image defines it asp

Negative 69409 pIm working on implementing probablistic matching for person record searching. As part of this, I plan to have blocking performed before any scoring is done. Currently, there are a lot of good options for transforming strings so that they can be stored and then searched for, with similar strings matching each other things like soundex, metaphone, etc.p  pHowever, Ive struggled to find something similar for purely numeric values. For example, it would be nice to be able to block on a social security number and not have numbers that are off or have transposed digits be removed from the results. 123456789 should have blocking results for 123456780 or 213456789.p  pNow, there are certainly ways to simply compare two numerical values to determine how similar they are, but what could I do when there are million of numbers in the database Its obviously impractical to compare them all and that would certainly invalidate the point of blocking.p  pWhat would be nice would be something where those three SSNs above could somehow be transformed into some other value that would be stored. Purely for example, imagine those three numbers ended up as AAABBCCC after this magical transformation. However, something like 987654321 would be ZZZYYYYXX and 123547698 would be AAABCCBC or something like that.p  pSo, my question is, is there a good transformation for numeric values like there exists for alphabetical values Or, is there some other approach that might make sense besides some highly complex or low performing SQL or logicp

Negative 69409 pI have an ASP.NET MVC application. I have a problem when I use code.poscode. This method receives in the first parameter the controller name and action name, for example codeControllerActioncode. The problem is that in some place for no reason the post method adds the controller name to the post method. I can observe this using emfirebugem. Heres an example from my source codep  precode.postCustomerCreate, , function data      Detalle.html     Detalle.appenddata  codepre  pFor no reason the call contains codeCustomerCustomerCreatecode. I can observe it in emfirebugem and this causes an error because codeCustomerCustomerCreatecode doesnt exist. What is the problem I have seen that if I use code.ajaxcode or code.loadcode I dont have this problem, but I prefer to use code.postcode instead of code.ajaxcode because will cause a great change. Can someone explain to me what is cuasing the problem Thank you friends.p
Negative 69409 pIt is known that if I would like to find whether an object is in an arraylist I can either use the contains methodp  precodeifarraylist.containsobj   do things  codepre  por I could use a for loop providing that I have overloaded the equals methodp  precodeforObject o  arraylist        ifobj.equalso            do things          codepre  pAs it is referred in other posts, contains actually makes use internally of a for loop and the equals method. Therefore, my question is is it logical to expect contains to take more time when the arraylist is larger p  pI am asking this because in my code I use contains in order to avoid for loops and therefore keep the run time low and constant, but I notice that the code runs significantly slower as the arraylist size becomes larger. p

Negative 69409 pI am thinking about the database schema for a road map and thinking about the best possible model.I have following queries in my mind that need to be tackled likep  precodeDo streets s1 and s2 intersect Get all streets adjacent to point of interest p.

Get the shortest route from intersection i1 to intersection i2. codepre  pI thought the table names shouldp  precoderoads and streets, including highways governmental regions states, counties, and local municipalities of cities, towns, villages codepre  pI have strong expertise in Database modeling, but this is first time I am creating a schema like this, Any help in this regardp  pAs per SO rules, OP have to show some effort , I have seen some a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions16904033howdoiproperlydesignadatabaseschemaforthisscenariosimilar questionsa thats why I am asking for help in schema.p
Negative 69409 pi am trying to run a query in mysql to select all records from a table where the enddate of that record is greater than or equal to the current date, but it keeps coming up with MySQL returned an empty result set.  But such a record definitely exists n my table, is there a problem with my queryp  pthis is the value in the enddate column for the one record 03242014.p  pand this is my query p  precodeSELECT  FROM  WHERE DATEenddate gt DATECURDATE codepre  pI have my suspicions however that it may be the date format meaning the date format on my computer might be like this ddMMyyyy Whereas the date format on the server might be like this  MMddyyyyp  pUnfortunately if that is the case i dunno what to do about that yet.p

Since my predecessors set a session scope for almost every bean, and set a server timeout of 6 hours with some javascript refreshing before it expires in the browser, users have very long sessions and keep accumulating memory.

Now when the users come back to main page their session wheights around 300kb, broken down as follow p  ul liAjaxStateManagerSynchronizedStateHolder 280kbli liOther objects in session 20kbli ul  pThose results were obtained by making heapdump and analyzing memory with Eclipse MAT.

I got a lot of forms since its ecommerce like, so my logic is like thisp  ul liif form is sendli livalidate formli liif errors occured  display errorsli liif validation passed  headerLocationli liform itselfli ul  pI must use codeltmeta charsetutf8gtcode positioned in the code as high as possible to handle very output including database inserts and such.p  pEvery time I use codeheaderLocationcode I get this warning that headers been already sent. I fixed it temporarily but I dont believe its good practice to do that this wayp  precodeobstart echo ltmeta charsetutf8gt codepre  pI understand that I should also use codeobcleancode somewhere but dont know where exactly, maybe someone could advise best solution for this or explain how to do it right.p  pMy second problem is regarding jsonencode with UTF8. I find it easy and useful to do codejsonencodecode and decode while working with database and objects, but when I finished app testing and started insert real data Ive noticed that codejsonencodecode puts some bushes D into db instead of utf8 characters. p  pFunny thing is that if I prepare codejsonstringcode manually by using codeforeachcodees and such, then codejsondecodecode produces proper UTF8 words, but whats the point of using json conversions if I have to build valid json string by myself . My host provider only offers php 5.3 so I cant use those escape methods introduced in 5.4. Any thoughtsp  pThank you in advance for your assistancep

What is the difference of handler when it succeed load page and trigger Timeout Exception Why timeout exception doesnt remove the previous memory Is there any way to remove the memory leaksp  precodedef run     try         driver  webdriver.PhantomJS         driver.setpageloadtimeout20          driver.geturl          driver.quit         del driver          run     except KeyboardInterrupt         raise      except         print   TIMEOUT          driver.quit          del driver         driver  None         gc.collect          here, python process memory usage in Task Manager  System Monitor always increase. if I call this function recursively, memory leak always increase when Timeout exception triggered. codepre  p br Python 2.7br Selenium 2.42.1br PhantomJS 1.9.7brp

But the compiler must be able to figure out the correct function from the static type of the actual arguments. The problem is that as soon as I specify them, decltype returns the type of the expression, i.e. the return type of the function.p  precode  itkImageltint, 3gt image   int a  3   ...   typedef myfunctiontraitslt decltypefunc2ltint, 2gtimage, 3 gt Traits codepre  pMy main goal is to check the constness of the first argument.p  pThanks for any helpp

Negative 69409 pIm currently trying to make a pair of classes which depend on each other.  Essentially, objects of class codeBcode create objects of class codeAcode.  However, I am also using an inheritance hierarchy, so all derivatives of class codeBcode must also be able to create derivatives of class codeAcode each derivative of codeBcode corresponds to a derivative of codeAcode, so codeDerB1code makes codeDerA1code objects, and codeDerB2code makes codeDerA2code objects.p  pIm having problems with my implementation, and it may be silly, but I would like to see if anyone knows what to do.  My code is below I HATE reading other peoples code, so I tried to make it as easy to read as possible...only a few important bits, which I commented to explainp  precodeclass BaseB   Declare BaseB early to use in BaseA constructor  class BaseA  public BaseABaseB b   Declare the BaseA constructor callable by all B classes, which pass a pointer to themselves to the constructor so the A objects can keep track of their parent   class DerApublic BaseA      DerABaseB bBaseAb   Inherit the BaseA constructor, and use initialization list   class BaseB  public     virtual BaseA createA  0  Virtual function, representing method to create A objects   class DerBpublic BaseB      BaseA createA          DerA a  new DerAthis  Definition of createA to make a new A object, specifically one of type DerA Error1 No instance of constructor DerADerA matches the argument list         return a  Error2 Cannot return DerA for BaseA function       codepre  pSo, I have two main problems, one is practical Error1, as I seem to simply be calling the function wrong, even if I try to typecast codethiscode, one is philosophical Error 2, as I dont know how to implement the features I want. If anyone could point out why Error1 is occurring, that would be wonderful  Error2, however, requires some explanation.p  pI would like my user programmer to interact with all codeAcode objects the same way.  They will have the same exact public functions, but each will have VERY different implementations of these functions.  Some will be using different data types and so will require function contracts, but many will have the same data types just with different algorithms that they use on them.  I would like some piece of code to work exactly the same way if one class codeAcode derivative is used or another is.  However, in my current implementation, it seems that I need to return a codeDerAcode object instead of a codeBaseAcode object at the site of Error2.  This means that I will need to write a segment of main code SPECIFICALLY for a codeDerAcode object, instead of any arbitrary codeAcode object.  I would like something likep  precodeBaseB b  new DerB  Declare which derivative of BaseB I want to use BaseA a  bgtcreateAb  Call the createA function in that derivative, which will automatically make a corresponding A object codepre  pThis way, I can simply choose which type of codeBcode object I would like in the first line by my choice of codeBcode constructor, or tag, or template, or something, and the rest of the code will look the same for any type of object codeBcode as each has the same public member functions, even though each object will perform those functions differently.p  pWould I be better off using templates or some other method instead of inheritance  I apologize for being intentionally vague, but I hope my class AB example should mostly explain what I need.p  pThank you for any help.  I apologize for asking two questions in one post and for being longwinded, but I am trying to learn the best way to approach a rather large redesign of some software.p

Negative 69409 pI am new to Spring and trying to develop some REST API. I have two types of users Sellers and Customers. Each has a separate model, DAO class and table in MySQL database and I am using Hibernate to access it.p  pI have come across various tutorials, such as a hrefhttpwww.mkyong.comspringsecurityspringsecurityhibernateannotationexample relnofollowhttpwww.mkyong.comspringsecurityspringsecurityhibernateannotationexamplea , and answers on this site, but I am still not sure how I can implement this for multiple user types. p  pI was thinking about using different URLs for each login, i.e. sellerlogin and customerlogin, but I am not sure exactly how this would work and how I can get different UserDetails object based on the URL. What is the best way to go about this Any links to references, tutorials, examples and other relevant answers would be greatly appreciated as I am pretty clueless when it comes to Spring Security.p

I want the input to be shown on the screen and with new lines after the input, the same way it would look if the user entered everything manually. The way it is being shown now is the prompt and then a space and then the next prompt and so on.p  pI have looked at many different questions but none have provided the answer. I could just print the input every time from the program itself but that would mean it would print the input even when the user manually enters the data.p  pI do understand that it happens because the input is coming from a file and not the command line but I still want to get around that. Is there anyway I could do this I cant use any external tools because I have to submit this script for a class. p

Negative 69409 pIn my Application using JavaScript I have the typical Alert message that is shown if a user tries to leave the page before saving their data.p  pThis is done using the codebeforeunloadcode Event.  This event only allows you to change and set custom text and nothing more.   I read that some browsers do not even allow your custom text to be usedp  pSo anyways in my application I now have a fancy looking Dialog window that I use throughout the app when I need a user to confirm something.p  pSo ideally I would like my custom Dialog to show when a user tries to leave the page with unsaved changes.  I can even have my AJAX Save button right in the Dialog for the user to save from therep  pAs we know this simply is impossible it seems using the codebeforeunloadcode Event.  p  pSo I came up with another plan, instead of simply giving up and saying its impossible like every single StackOverflow question and blog post on the matter did and said, I prefer to venture past that because I know it can be donep  pI have an idea of how to do it and then after my idea came, I found a site that actually does it already  strongFacebookstrongp  pSo in my app I have a Global JavaScript variablecodevar unsavedChanges  falsecode  Now anytime a change is made on the page for the Form fields and actions that I say constitute a Change, I then will set codevar unsavedChanges  truecode when that happens on these items.p  pcodeunsavedChangescode is how I determine to show or not to show my codebeforeunloadcode event alert.p  pSo using this same variable, instead of simply showing the codebeforeunloadcode event alert, I would like to also use it in another event.p  pI would like to set a codeclickcode event on all my links.  So anytime a link is clicked in my app, it will check codeunsavedChangescode and if codetruecode, I will show my own custom jQuery Dialog window.  It will have a Save button inside it to save the content and a button to cancel and one to continue on to there desired destination.  It should also set codeunsavedChangescode to codefalsecode which will hopefully prevent the codewindow.beforeunloadcode event from firing directly after.p  pNow I mentioned that Facebook seems to do exactly what I just outlined or at least very similar on there Messages page.p  h2Exit by Link Clickh2  pHere is a screenshot of that in action when a strongLINK is clickedstrong....p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comNZgnO.png altenter image description herep  h2Exit by NonLink Clickh2  pNow when you bypass the Link click and try to Close window or enter a new URL in address bar, basically any other sort of Page Exit that is not a link click, it then falls back to the default browser behavior for the codebeforeunloadcode event p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comNr9Kj.png althttpi.imgur.comKfpdbFS.pngp  pSo what I described above seems to be possible if you look at what Facebook is doing, it seems like how I outlined is an achievable way of doing this.  Obviously you lose the NonLink click exit custom Dialog support but it never existed anyway so no loss there and you are adding support for it on all link clicks, that is awesomep  pNow I have the idea for this but I dont know exactly how to code it up working 100 and I need help.p  pFor example some issues that I do not know how to deal with...p  ul liIf a link is clicked and it already has a click event on that link, then how do we use this new click event and also use the existing click eventli liSome links might not warrant this behavior.  If I have a link that has a click event on it already and that event does something like remove an item or add an item to page, then it is not even trying to leave the page in the first place so it should not show the Dialog  So there needs to be some type of way to set a link to not have this functionality.  Also perhaps it could by default NOT be set on links that have no link in them. codelta hrefgtcode or  codelta hrefgtcode or codelta hreftargetNamegtcode these should obviously not have the click event on themli ul  pSo this is all an idea at this point that I now see Facebook has in action somehow  I would love to hear more ideas, thoughts, anything related to the matter.  This would make a really good blog posts if a good solution comes out of this questions as hundreds of people seem to really want this functionality and I know I have for years now myself.p

Negative 69409 pI have an activity with many fragments that uses action bar and navigation drawer. It has home as up enabled.

Ive switched to v7 version together with new codeToolbarcode to get Material Design look.

Negative 69409 pIn my code, I would like to do the following i.e. pass the name of string which becomes the fileName that I write to, when the string name is passed by reference, I am unable to use the  operator overloading to append .txt to my fileName, same code shown belowp  precodevoid myFunction string ampfileName     1    fileName  .txt    fstream file     file.openfileName, iostreamout  codepre  pVS2012 Intellisense shows an error at  saying no operator matches these operands I tried by passing it by adding, which mean  operator cant be used on string names passed by reference. At least thats what I understand. p  pBut when I copy the fileName reference to another string and use that, it produces a file without a name i.e. just a .txt file. p  precodestring myName  fileName  fileName  .txt at 1 codepre  pThe file was produced without any name.

Negative 69409 pI want to know if I missed something or if I encountered a new retina bug once again. My app on the iPhone6Plus looks like a scaled version app from the nonretina era and heres why.p  pFor most of my needs, I use code[UIImage imageWithContentsOfFiles]code because I only load them once and I dont need the system to cache images like code[UIImage imageNamed]code does. The former has to be given a full or partial path in most cases a path using code[[NSBundle mainBundle] resourcePath]code suffices, the other one the name of a resource in the applications main bundle.p  pIt is my belief that code[UIImage imageWithContentsOfFiles]code and code[UIImage imageNamed]code should behave the same when resolving the right image file to use according to the devices scaling. Well it doesnt seem to be case.p  pFor instance, if no 3x images are available but 1.0 and 2x images are, the iPhone6Plus will simply ignore the 2x images when using code[UIImage imageWithContentsOfFiles]code unless an absolute path to the 2x image file is given. p  pOn the other hand, code[UIImage imageNamed]code does load the 2x image on the iPhone6Plus if the 3x image is not available. The 2x image is there, but on a device with a scaling greater than 2.0, code[UIImage imageWithContentsOfFiles]code just resolves to the 1.0 image instantly.p

Negative 69409 pSo I have reached my ceiling of knowledge when it comes to Qt and C in general I guess. I am creating check boxes in a QScrollArea based off the input from a QComboBox. Depending on the value selected in the QComboBox, a specific number of check boxes are created. Once I created those check boxes, I am having a problem understanding how to interact in my case, simply check to see if they are checked or not with them outside of the function they are being created and called in. I know how to work with them if the buttons were static, but since the check boxes are dynamic is that the right word and can change, I dont know what to do. Below is a little snippet of code on how the check boxes are created. If I now want to simply check if any of the boxes are checked, how do I do that. Can I return or call the created check boxes in another function somehow I know Ill simply need to loop through the array and check, I just simply dont know how to get the array of check boxes into another function or how to return them in the function below. p  pThanks for the helpp  precodevoid MyProgramcreatecheckboxesQString opnum  QWidget MDAcheckboxes  new QWidgetuigtMDA QVBoxLayout MDAlayout  new QVBoxLayoutMDAcheckboxes QCheckBox MDAmycheckBox[9] QListltQStringgt boxes  if opnum  640      boxes ltlt 161 ltlt 162      for int i  0 i lt 2 i          MDAmycheckBox[i]  new QCheckBoxMDAcheckboxes     MDAmycheckBox[i]gtsetTextboxes[i]     MDAlayoutgtaddWidgetMDAmycheckBox[i]          uigtMDAgtsetWidgetMDAcheckboxes  else if opnum  645      boxes ltlt 1301ltlt132ltlt133ltlt134ltlt135      for int i  0 i lt 5 i          MDAmycheckBox[i]  new QCheckBoxMDAcheckboxes     MDAmycheckBox[i]gtsetTextboxes[i]     MDAlayoutgtaddWidgetMDAmycheckBox[i]          uigtMDAgtsetWidgetMDAcheckboxes  else if opnum  650       boxes ltlt 136ltlt137ltlt138ltlt139ltlt1310ltlt1311ltlt1312ltlt1313ltlt1314     for int i  0 i lt 9 i          MDAmycheckBox[i]  new QCheckBoxMDAcheckboxes     MDAmycheckBox[i]gtsetTextboxes[i]     MDAlayoutgtaddWidgetMDAmycheckBox[i]          uigtMDAgtsetWidgetMDAcheckboxes   codepre

Negative 69409 pIm new to ASP.NET MVC 5, and Im trying to build several areas that all have the same sidebar navigation menu the navigation is a simple bootstrap component, no serverside logic. So depending on the area, a different item in the navigation bar should be made active. This all works great when I only use one root area.p  pBut how can I share the same navigation menu in all areas I understand that there is usually a ViewsViewstart.cshtml file for the root area, which points to a common shared SharedLayout.cshtml. I would like to use a common layout for all areas.p  pSo the areas are   rootempty for the welcome pagemain page   Setup area   Sales area   Inventory areap  pSo the sidebar nvigation contains those for links. The sidebar should always be visible in all areas.p  pstrongWhat is the correct way of accomplishing thatstrongp

Negative 69409 pIm doing a navigation that has a background image slide effect. The main idea is to have three list items that contain the same background image but with a different position. The background image for each item will be animated to slide into place in different times.   The background image sliding direction from the list item in the middle will depend on which item the user was before coming from the right, it will slide from the left and vice versa.   On top of that we will have submenus that appear with their semitransparent background sliding in. they will slide into their places and change color.

Negative 69409 pI try to use boostMSM to implement a simple state machine for testing purpose.

Negative 69409 pI have an index page that lists all users and their statuses available or unavailable, every user can change hisher status anytime.

Negative 69409 pI am wondering if there is a functionmethod to create jobs which are triggered on emrandomem time. By that I mean that if I set a cron schedule to be triggered every monday at 10.00 am and given a time interval, lets say 30 minutes, the trigger will always go off from 9.30  10.30. For example this is the cron schedule. p  precodeschedule.setCronSchedule0 0 10   MON trigger  newTrigger                         .withIdentitytriggerId                         .startNow  lt                          .withDescriptionschedule.getCronSchedule                         .withSchedulecronScheduleschedule.getCronSchedule.build codepre  pIf I have a variable with a specific range in minutes can I set it to trigger randomly And by that I mean not just take the cron schedule string and remodify it, but using a method to trigger the event every time, based on the random range so first monday may be triggered at 10.01 second monday may be triggered at 9.46 and etc.p  pThanks in advance.p

Negative 69409 pHi I am using an observable collection which I am displaying in the datagrid on the wpf screen. p  pI have linked this with ADO.NET Entity Data Model object. When I make any change to the data in the datagrid and do SaveChanges this gets saved in the database. But if I add a row then that doesnt get added. Where am I going wrong. p  pThe code used  Customer is a ADO.NET Entity Data Model object added for the table CustomerTable in SQL database. p  precodeCustomer contextCust  new Customer var list  from e in contextCust.CustomerTable select e custCollection  new ObservableCollectionltCustomerTablegtlist codepre  pNow when I change any data in the existing datagrid on the UI display I call the function p  precodecontextCust.SaveChanges codepre  pThis works fine. But if I add a row on the UI, it gets added to the observable collection but how do I push this to the contextCust. Looks like only data changes are allowed by SaveChanges method but not adding of rows. p  pIs there a way I can cast observable collection to CustomerTable type and make contextCust consume the same. Kindly advise.p  pThanks, Tp

Negative 69409 pI need to compare todays date, which is calculated as today  p  precode timeTime.now  todaytime.day.tostime.month.tostime.year.tos codepre  pwhere today would look like p  precode2142015  codepre  pBut when that example today goes into the db, sqlite autoformats it to look like p  precode20150421 codepre  pBut, I need to check whether today declared above is equal to the attribute from the db post conversion. This, invariably, returns false, because whilst they are the same thing, the strings arent equal.

Negative 69409 pThis question has been discussed a hrefhttpmeta.stackoverflow.comquestions291558whyarefactcheckingquestionsnotwelcomeonstackoverflowhere on Metaa and my a hrefhttpstackoverflow.coma298277063627607answera give links to a test system to answer this.p  hr  pThe question often comes up about whether to use gawk or mawk or C or some other language due to performance so lets create a canonical questionanswer for a trivial and typical awk program.p  pThe result of this will be an answer that provides a comparison of the performance of different tools performing the basic text processing tasks of regexp matching and field splitting on a simple input file. If tool X is twice as fast as every other tool for this task then that is useful information. If all the tools take about the same amount of time then that is useful information too.p  pThe way this will work is that over the next couple of days many people will contribute answers which are the programs to be tested and then one person volunteers will test all of them on one platform or a few people will test some subset on their platform so we can compare and then all of the results will be collected into a single answer.p  pGiven a 10 Million line input file created by this scriptp  precode awk BEGINfor i1ilt10000000i print i5misshit,i,  thirdt tfourth gt file   wc l file 10000000 file   head 10 file miss 1   third          fourth miss 2   third          fourth miss 3   third          fourth miss 4   third          fourth hit 5   third           fourth miss 6   third          fourth miss 7   third          fourth miss 8   third          fourth miss 9   third          fourth hit 10   third          fourth codepre  pand given this awk script which prints the 4th then 1st then 3rd field of every line that starts with hit followed by an even numberp  precode cat tst.awk hit [[digit]]0   print 4, 1, 3  codepre  pHere are the first 5 lines of expected outputp  precode awk f tst.awk file  head 5 fourth hit third fourth hit third fourth hit third fourth hit third fourth hit third codepre  pand here is the result when piped to a 2nd awk script to verify that the main script above is actually functioning exactly as intendedp  precode awk f tst.awk file  awk seen[0]unqr0 ENDprint unq1 ampamp seen[r]1000000 ampamp rfourth hit third  PASS  FAIL PASS codepre  pHere are the timing results of the strong3rd execution ofstrong gawk 4.1.1 running in bash 4.3.33 on cygwin64p  precode time awk f tst.awk file gt devnull real    0m4.711s user    0m4.555s sys     0m0.108s codepre  pNote the above is the 3rd execution to remove caching differences.p  pCan anyone provide the equivalent C, perl, python, whatever code to thisp  precode cat tst.awk hit [[digit]]0   print 4, 1, 3  codepre  pi.e. find THAT REGEXP on a line were not looking for some other solution that works around the need for a regexp, split the line at each series of contiguous white space and print the 4th, then 1st, then 3rd fields separated by a single blank charp  pIf so we can test them all on one platform to seerecord the performance differences.p  hr  pThe code contributed so farp  pAWK can be tested against gawk, etc. but mawk, nawk and perhaps others will require [09] instead of [digit]p  precodeawk hit [[digit]]0   print 4, 1, 3  file codepre  pPHPp  precodephp R ifpregmatchhit d0 , argnfpregsplits, argn echo f[3]. .f[0]. .f[2] lt file codepre  pshellp  precodeegrep hit [[digit]]0  file  awk print 4, 1, 3 grep mmap E hit [[digit]]0  file  awk print 4, 1, 3  codepre  pRubyp  precode cat tst.rb File.openfile.readlines.each do line   line.gsubhits[09]0s.s.  puts 3 1 2  end  ruby tst.rb codepre  pPerlp  precodenone yet codepre  pPythonp  precodenone yet codepre  pCp  precodenone yet codepre

I can not understand why.  p  pCan you explain itp  pIm using MS Visual Studio 2013 Update 4.p  p[Edit] Here is a follow up, after reading the comments and other related materials. I think my question can now be reduced to the following I got it that braceinitlist is not allowed in the RHS of an binary expression, and also that it IS allowed in a function call. The thing is, I think the binary expression, say, codearg1  arg2code is converted internally by the compiler to a function call codeoperator arg1, arg2code, especially when arg1 is a class type. So at this point, there is no difference between binary expression and function call. As a result, the only explanation I can figure out is that there is a preventing rule applied before such a binaryexpressiontofunctioncall conversion, that checks particularly whether the second argument is a braceinitlist or not. If it is, conversion to an equivalent function call will be forbidden and an error is produced. I wonder if these conjectures are real and if it is, is it written somewhere specifically in the C standard Thank everyone who participated in my question.p

Negative 69409 pSo I have a console application running in Mono 3.12.0 on OSX. Occassionally, and I mean, maybe once every 100 or more executions of codeCleanupPriorToApplicationStartcode, I get the stacktrace below and the parent thread that calls the cleanup method dies basically Process.Start must wrap native code and that native code throws an exception, at least thats what i think is happening. The process stays around though, so its not a full exit, which makes it really tough to know when this happens and correct it. The Exception handler in the cleanup methods log message never makes it out there, so for whatever reason the mono runtime isnt wrapping this native exception in a .NETMono exception so it can be handled. Is this expected Is there a way to catch this behavior without my thread getting taken outp  precode    protected override void CleanupPriorToApplicationStart              try                      ResetAppleMailDefaultWindowSize                  catch Exception ex                      logger.Warningex, ApplicationName Default Window Size reset FAILED with message, ApplicationName                    private void ResetAppleMailDefaultWindowSize              logger.Debug0 resetting Default Window Size, ApplicationName         var info  new ProcessStartInfodefaults,  write com.apple.mail NSWindow Frame Torn Off Window 13 630 1024 768 0 0 2560 1417          var p  new Process StartInfo  info         p.Start         p.WaitForExit6.Seconds          logger.Debug0 Default Window Size reset, ApplicationName      codepre  pHere is the output from the consolep  precodeDEBUG  Mail resetting Default Window Size Stacktrace    at ltunknowngt lt0xffffffffgt   at wrapper managedtonative System.Diagnostics.Process.Processfreeinternal System.Diagnostics.Process,intptr lt0xffffffffgt   at System.Diagnostics.Process.Dispose bool lt0x0013fgt   at System.Diagnostics.Process.Finalize  lt0x00018gt   at wrapper runtimeinvoke object.runtimeinvokevirtualvoidthis object,intptr,intptr,intptr lt0xffffffffgt  Native stacktrace codepre  pUPDATEp  pBecause of some googling, id like to emphasize that before the Cleanup method is called, I am explicitly calling Garbage Collection codeGC.Collectcode p

Negative 69409 pffmpeg has a codequalitycode setting when encoding VP9 with options codebestcode, codegoodcode, and coderealtimecode. How do these options affect the other available encoding options ex. codespeedcode, codeslicescode, codeframeparallelcode, etc... I read somewhere that codebestcode and codegood speed 0code will give about the same quality, with the later being much faster. To me this makes it sound like the quality settings just change the other options such as codespeedcode as if they are merely presets and one could achieve the same results manually. Is this true, or do the quality settings affect things I couldnt change with other optionsp

Impossiblep  pstrongAdditional Explanationstrong p  pIm trying to detect whether I can open a new window via targetblank. For example, UIWebView [inapp browser] can prevent targetblank from working as expected [it simply opens in the same window instead of a new one]. I need a solution to indicate when a new window cant be opened because of browser limitations such as in the UIWebView case. Unfortunately popup blockers prevent checking such functionality because they never allow a new window to be opened without user inputie. a click to be bypassed. p

This event is fired        for any authentication related change, such as login, logout or session refresh. This means that        whenever someone who was previously logged out tries to log in again, the correct case below         will be handled.        FB.Event.subscribeauth.authResponseChange, functionresponse           Here we specify what we do with the response anytime this event occurs.          if response.status  connected             The response object is returned with a status field that lets the app know the current            login status of the person.

In reallife usage, you wouldnt want to immediately prompt someone to login             like this, for two reasons            1 JavaScript created popup windows are blocked by most browsers unless they             result from direct interaction from people using the app such as a mouse click            2 it is a bad experience to be continually prompted to login upon page load.           FB.login          else             In this case, the person is not logged into Facebook, so we call the login             function to prompt them to do so. Note that at this stage there is no indication            of whether they are logged into the app. If they arent then theyll see the Login            dialog right after they log in to Facebook.

The strings though are usually repeated, or have huge amounts of overlap. So my intuition tells me the compressed value should be the compress value of 1 string, plus a little extra.p  pI JSON.stringify this object and try to compress.p  pMost compression libraries did a bad job of compressing the strings, since the server sends me a gzip compressed version of 77kb, I know it can be at least this small.p  pgzipjsp  plzmajsp  pDid a good job out of the maybe 15 libraries I tried.p  pThe issue is gzipjs is linear in the number of strings. But lzma does this correctly, where it only increases in size slightly. p  pLzmajslevel 2 is very slow unfortunately20s vs 1s gzip when compressing 7mbsabout 30 strings.p  pIs there a compressopn library out there, that is roughly as quick as gzip, but doesnt scale linearly on repeat stringsp
Negative 69409 pRecently Ive made some research as I needed to find efficient way of calculating whether 2 convex or concave polygons intersect. I dont need all intersection points but the first one between segments from 2 different figures. p  pIn my case one polygon wont have more than 4 edges but the second has approximately 20 edges. I am quite fresh in this area and would like to ask if theres more efficient approach to solving such a problem than On logn  k trapezoid sweep algorithmp  pIn case one polygon has 4 edges and the other has 20 edges the simple brute force approach would need pessimistically 420  80 checks between 2 segments. p  pBecouse the first polygon has only 4 edges the trapezoid sweep seems to be slower O24 log24  k  110. Does this mean that I should use the brute force approach or there exists some better solution to this or maybe the sweep algorithm would perform better in practicep

Im generating multiple posts on one page using codeforeachcode loop, so the namesidsclasses of the elements are the same. p  phr For a little better understanding, heres an example of what a post might look like brp  precodeltdiv classfeedPostgt     ltimg src classfeedProfilegt     lta href classfeedNamegtFirstName LastNameltagt     ltdiv classfeedPostBodygtHello, worldltdivgt     ltinput typehidden value24772 namefeedPostIDgt     ltspan classfeedLikeButtongtLikeltspangt  lta hrefgtCommentltagt  2 mins ago ltdivgt codepre  pand, using javascriptjquery, I want to be able to do something like this in an external js filep  precode.feedLikeButton.onclick,function   var postid  0 I need to get the ID from the post that the like button is related to.
