Positive 127 pI am a newbie in python programming. I started a project for a scoretable. The concecpt is very easy. 2 Players, there scores should be raised and a timer that increases. No problem so far. In addition the whole thing should be controlled by a Wii remote controller. I started to implement the wiiconnection code using threading. If I now execute the code and connect the wii controller the execution becomes more than slow and output comes only sporadically. The strange thing is, if I now attach strace to that process it runs normal, if its killed its slow again and so on. Did anyone saw that kind of behavior  After that I tried to implement the wii connection using multiprocessing. That worked normal so far, but now I got the problem that I cannot call other windows gtk because of the 2 processes that access the same handlers for connecting to the Xserver. What can I do to get this running  Many thanks in advance, best regards,p  pNicop  pmain.py should be started to call WiiRemote.py.

Positive 127 pI am trying to clear the selected folder from a GTK FileChooserButton. By default, the button shows None and I would like to have a way to reselect that. I have found a I think hacky way by calling fcbButton.setCurrentFolderNULL the option to select None is available on the list but the button itself does not change to reflect that unless manually chosen. In addition, I would like to do this for a FileChooserButton that is in SELECT FOLDER mode as well as reset the selected file in one that is in OPEN FILE mode.p  pI have tried passing an empty string. For the one in mode SELECT FOLDER, it changes the selected folder to be the working directory. For the one in mode OPEN FILE it crashes.p  pI have tried passing in NULL. It crashes in both cases.p

Positive 127 pTrying to setup GTK 3.0 on Codeblocks Win7. Having some trouble finding exactly how to do this.p  pThe GTK website directs you to msys2. It seems there was once a direct download on the GTK site for an allinone Windows bundle that is no longer there.p  pHaving followed the instructions, installed and updated msys2, I see no reference to GTK, in the installed files or on the mysys website that GTK directs you to.p  pIts seems very linuxy in terms of being unnecessarily and stupidly unclear to do something that should be simple. Maybe im missing something but should it not be as simple as downloading a zipped folder, extracting and setting up pathsp  pAt this rate id be faster learning C and going with Qt.p  pThe question is in the title, I am amazed I am having to ask the question, it seems like one that google should have completely covered but everything I am finding is relating to a download that is no longer available on the GTK website. I can find no info regarding msys2 and GTK 3.0.p  pThanks in advance.p

Negative 127 pI want to bounce an idea around. I have been building web services and web applications for over a decade now, and have more recently been focusing on providing as RESTful a service as possible eg. using the same URI for both browsers and API clients, but having them modify accept to decide if to send XML or XHTML.p  pOne big sticking point with using web browsers with RESTful services has been keeping track of user state on private methods. The best way to go about it is for the client to provide HTTP auth token, but not many customers or users like being prompted by a HTTP auth box in their browser, especially when they are used to webform based login.p  pHTTP auth also has other issues such as poor expiry support, but in other areas is a lot better than cookie sessions.p  pMy idea is to allow web forms to submit HTTP auth information, by doing the followingp  ul liProvide 2 new HTML input form types, namely typeusername and typeauthli liWhen these types are included in a form, the browser will send the values along with the request to the form URI as an HTTP authentication field rather than as POST or GET values.li ul  pThis can mean that we can have both RESTful user authentication, but without the standard browser login boxes. I have prototyped a dirty Firefox plugin that sort of does this, but currently only supporting BASIC auth it would eventually work with Digest.p  pThe problem that I can see is if this idea works well, having it standardized and ratified so that all browsers support it along with the standard ugly boxes.p  pAnybody have any feedback on this idea, or know of any similar effort p  pI have an upcoming project that is an intranet and I am almost tempted to finish the plugin along with client SSL cert support and use it there as a test. p  pI couldnt find anything similar, other than a couple of small projects where developers were using Javascript to read in username and password from a form and then using them as the http auth token in an XMLHTTPRequestp  h2Further  Next Stepsh2  pAfter a bunch of research on this, I have decided to take the 1999 template as the basis for a new proposal to submit to the WHATWG for HTML5.

Negative 127 pI want to let the user automatically relogin in my Flex app, which uses Basic Authenticationp  pBy the way, I have noted this a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions490806httpbasicauthenticationwithhttpserviceobjectsinadobeflexairStackOverflow questiona, which is relevant, but does not address the question of logging out clientside.p  pFor example, after user A logs in, user B comes to the browser, goes to the login screen perhaps in a new tab  and logs in. p  pThis should mean that I send user Bs credentials in the HTTP headers, and that since these are different from  user As, the server notes the fact and creates a new and separate session.p  pHowever, Flexs HTTP proxy catches the header and actually ignores these new credentials.p  pFlex does offer a way to tell the server to logout, and the Flex login code could invoke this every time before sending credentials, but that seems like an ugly workaround.   I want to be able to do this clientside. I could also use a nonstandard header for Basic Authentication since I control the serverside Authentication as well, but that also seems like an ugly workaround.p  pIs there some way to simply end the session on clientside from Flex code This is possible from JavaScript, for example. p  pAnd is there a way to directly work with cookies at clientside, as I can in JavaScriptp  pI understand that some of the limitations may be caused by security considerations, but all my communication is to the home server, so it should be possible to avoid the restrictions.p

The algorithm works relatively well on synthetic images, but fail on pictures that contain reflections, or have larger differences in light intensity.

Negative 127 pOk heres my problem. I have a form that when it is not maximised, its maximum size has to be the total height of the components inside the form. To achieve this, i use thisp  precodeprivate void resizeformobject sender, EventArgs e  this.MaximumSize  new System.Drawing.Size1000, this.panel4.Height  this.label2.Height  this.HeightMin  codepre  pThat fires on the Resize event of the form. Because the component size is always changing it made sense to do this on a resize event. How ever if i want to maximise the form, the form just goes to the highest settings defined in this.MaximumSize. So i was wondering is there a way to tell when a form is going to be maximised and set its maximumsize to the screen boundarys before the form maximises.p  pIf there is a better way to change the maximumsize value without resize event, that would also be great p

Negative 127 pI have an application which saves documents think word documents in an Xml based format  Currently C classes generated from xsd files are used for reading  writing the document format and all was well until recently when I had to make a change the format of the document. My concern is with backwards compatability as future versions of my application  strongneedstrong to be able to read documents saved by all previous versions and ideally I also want older versions of my app to be able to gracefully handle reading documents saved by future versions of my app.p  pFor example, supposing I change the schema of my document to add an optional extra element somewhere, then older versions of my application will simply ignore the extra elemnt and there will be no problemsp  precodeltdocgt lt Existing document gt ltmyElementgtHello WorldltmyElementgt ltdocgt codepre  pHowever if a breaking change is made an attribute is changed into an element for example, or a collection of elements, then past versions of my app should either ignore this element if it is optional, or inform the user that they are attempting to read a document saved with a newer version of my app otherwise. Also this is currently causing me headaches as all future versions of my app need entirely separate code is needed for reading the two different documents.p  pAn example of such a change would be the following xmlp  precodeltdocgt lt Existing document gt ltsomeElement contents12 gt ltdocgt codepre  pChanging top  precodeltdocgt lt Existing document gt ltsomeElementgt     ltcontentsgt12ltcontentsgt ltcontentsgt13ltcontentsgt ltsomeElementgt ltdocgt codepre  pIn order to prevent support headaches in the future I wanted to come up with a decent strategy for handling changes I might make in the future, so that versions of my app that I release now are going to be able to cope with these changes in the futurep  ul liShould the version number of the document be stored in the document itself, and if so what versioning strategy should be used Should the document version match the .exe assembly version, or should a more complex strategy be used, for example major revision changed indicate breaking changes, wheras minor revision increments indicate nonbreaking changes  for example extra optional elementsli liWhat method should I use to read the document itself and how do I avoid replicating massive amounts of code for different versions of documents ul liAlthough XPath is obviously most flexible, it is a lot more work to implement than simply generating classes with xsd.li liOn the other hand if DOM parsing is used then a new copy of the document xsd would be needed in source control for each breaking change, causing problems if fixes ever need to be applied to older schemas old versions of the app are still supported.li ulli ul  pAlso, Ive worked all of this very loosly on the assumption that all changes I make can be split into these two categories of beaking changes and nonbreaking changes, but Im not entirely convinced that this is a safe assumption to make.p  pNote that I use the term document very loosely  the contents dont resemble a document at allp  pThanks for any advice you can offer me.p

Negative 127 pive developed an iPhone program which is kind of an image manipulation programp  pThe user get an UIImagePickerController and selects an image. Then the program does some heavy calculating in a new thread for responsiveness of the application. The thread has, of course, its own autorelease pool.

The app creates a new view controller, pushes it onto the navigation controller.p  pIn shortp  ol liUIImagePickerControllerli linew thread autorelease pool does some heavy calculation with image datali lisignal to main thread that its doneli limain thread creates view controller and pushes it onto navigation controllerli liview controller presents image resultli ol  pMy program works well, but if I dismiss the navigation controllers top view controller by tapping on the back button and repeat the whole process several times, my app crashes.

Negative 127 pOur static analysis tool complains about a useless type qualifier on return type when we have prototypes in header files such asp  precodeconst int foo codepre  pWe defined it this way because the function is returning a constant that will never change, thinking that the API seemed clearer with codeconstcode in place.p  pI feel like this is similar to explicitly initializing global variables to zero for clarity, even though the C standard already states that all globals will be initialized to zero if not explicitly initialized. At the end of the day, it really doesnt matter.

Negative 127 pI currently have a class hierarchy likep  precodeMatrixBase gt DenseMatrix            gt other types of matrices            gt MatrixView gt TransposeView                          gt DiagonalView                          gt other specialized views of matrices codepre  pcodeMatrixBasecode is an abstract class which forces implementers to define operatorint,int and such things it represents 2 dimensional arrays of numbers. codeMatrixViewcode represents a possibly mutable way of looking at a matrix, like transposing it or taking a submatrix. The point of codeMatrixViewcode is to be able to say something likep  precodeScaleDiagonalA, 2.0 codepre  pwhere codeDiagonalcode returns a codeDiagonalViewcode object which is a kind of lightweight adapter.p  pNow heres the questions. I will use a very simple matrix operation as an example. I want to define a function likep  precodetemplate ltclass Tgt void ScaleMatrixBaseltTgt ampA, const T ampscalefactor codepre  pwhich does the obvious thing the name suggests. I want to be able to pass in either an honesttogoodness nonview matrix, or an instance of a subclass of codeMatrixViewcode. The prototype as written above does not work for statements such asp  precodeScaleDiagonalA, 2.0 codepre  pbecause the codeDiagonalViewcode object returned by codeDiagonalcode is a temporary, and codeScalecode takes a nonconst reference, which cannot accept a temporary. Is there any way to make this work I tried to use SFINAE, but I dont understand it all that well, and Im not sure if that would solve the problem. It is important to me that these templated functions can be called without providing an explicit template argument list I want implicit instantiation. Ideally the statement above could work as written.p  phrp  pstrongEdit followup questionstrongp  pAs sbi responded below about rvalue references and temporaries, Is there a way to define two versions of Scale, one which takes a nonconst rvalue reference for nonviews, and one which takes a passbyvalue view The problem is to differentiate between these two at compile time in a way such that implicit instantiation will work.p  phrp  pstrongUpdatestrongp  pIve changed the class hierarchy top  precodeReadableMatrix WritableMatrix  public ReadableMatrix WritableMatrixView DenseMatrix  public WritableMatrix DiagonalView  public WritableMatrixView codepre  pThe reason codeWritableMatrixViewcode is distinct from codeWritableMatrixcode is that the view must be passed around by const reference, while the matrices themselves must be passed around by nonconst ref, so the accessor member functions have different constness. Now functions like Scale can be defined asp  precodetemplate ltclass Tgt void Scaleconst WritableMatrixViewltTgt ampA, const T ampscalefactor template ltclass Tgt void ScaleWritableMatrixltTgt ampA, const T ampscalefactor     ScaleWritableMatrixViewAdapterltTgtA, scalefactor  codepre  pNote that there are two versions, one for a const view, and a nonconst version for actual matrices. This means for functions like codeMultA, B, Ccode, I will need 8 overloads, but at least it works. What doesnt work, however is using these functions within other functions. You see, each codeViewcodelike class contains a member codeViewcode of what its looking at for example in the expression codeDiagonalSubMatrixAcode, the codeDiagonalcode function returns an object of type  codeDiagonalViewltSubMatrixViewltTgt gtcode, which needs to know the fully derived type of codeAcode. Now, suppose within codeScalecode I call some other function like it, which takes either a base view or matrix reference. That would fail because the construction of the needed codeViewcodes require the derived type of the argument of Scale information it does not have. Still working on find a solution to this.p  phrp  pstrongUpdatestrongp  pI have used what is effectively a homegrown version of Boosts enableif to select between two different versions of a function like codeScalecode. It boils down to labeling all my matrix and view classes with extra typedef tags indicating if they are readable and writable and view or nonview. In the end, I still need 2N overloads, but now N is only the number of nonconst arguments.

Negative 127 pIve been working with PhoneGap and its been great, but Ive run into a problem with getting location on a Verizon Droid w 2.0.1 works as expected on a G1 w 1.6.p  pGeoLocation API Support was added to Android in 2.0 Eclair and it works in the default browser on a Verizon Droid on 2.0.1.  That is, if I visit a website that calls navigator.geolocation.getCurrentPositionsuccesscallback, errorcallback, the device prompts that the current domain wants to know your location in a dialog with options to Share location or decline.  If I select Share location, successcallback eventually gets called with location data.p  pIf I visit the same website in a WebView, the call to navigator.geolocation.getCurrentPosition does not generate a javascript error, but the share your location dialog is not displayed and neither callback ever gets called.  In logcat, I see what seems to be a related error 0215 103700.413 ERRORgeolocationService16871 Caught security exception registering for location updates from system. This should only happen in DumpRenderTree.  p  pIt seems to me that the WebView is failing to register for location updates because it does not have the required permission, which in turn is a result of not prompting the user for the permission.  Although there were several methods and objects added to the Webkit package in Android 2.0 related to GeoPermissions, I havent been able to use any of them to cause WebView to display the GeoPermission dialog.p  pThe following is based on the Hello, WebView example from the Android Developers Guide but it adds some of the calls and objects that were added in 2.0 related to GeoPermissions.

Negative 127 pstrongEDITstrong  Changed example below to one that actually demonstrates the SIOF.p  pI am trying to understand all of the subtleties of this problem, because it seems to me to be a major hole in the language.  I have read that it cannot be prevented by the linker, but why is this so  It seems trivial to prevent in simple cases, like thisp  precode A.h extern int x   A.cpp include ltcstdlibgt  int x  rand   B.cpp include A.h include ltiostreamgt  int y  x  int main      stdcout ltlt y  prints the random value or garbage  codepre  pHere, the linker should be able to easily determine that the initialization code for A.cpp should happen before B.cpp in the linked executable, because B.cpp depends on a symbol defined in A.cpp and the linker obviously already has to resolve this reference.p  pSo why cant this be generalized to all compilation units.  If the linker detects a circular dependency, cant it just fail the link with an error or perhaps a warning, since it may be the programmers intent I suppose to define a global symbol in one compilation unit, and initialize it in anotherp  pDoes the standard levy any requirements on an implementation to ensure the proper initialization order in simple cases  What is an example of a case where this would not be possiblep  pI understand that an analogous situation can occur at global destruction time.  If the programmer does not carefully ensure that the dependencies during destruction are symmetrical to construction, a similar problem occurs.  Could the linker not warn about this scenario as wellp

Negative 127 pI have a server application, and a database. Multiple instances of the server can run at the same time, but all data comes from the same database on some servers it is postgresql, in other cases ms sql server.p  pIn my application, there is a process that is performed which can take hours. I need to ensure that this process is only executed one at a time. If one server is processing, no other server instance can process until the first one has completed.p  pThe process depends on one table lets call it ProcessTable. What I do is, before any server starts the hourlong process, I set a boolean flag in the ProcessTable which indicates that this record is locked and is being processed not all records in this table are processed  locked, so I need to specifically mark each record which is needed by the process. So when the next server instance comes along while the previous instance is still processing, it sees the boolean flags and throws an exception.p  pThe problem is, that 2 server instances might both be activated at nearly the same time, and when both check the ProcessTable, there may not be any flags set, but both servers are actually in the process of setting the flags but since the transaction hasnt yet commited for either process, neither process will see the locking done by the other process. This is because the locking mechanism itself may take a few seconds, so there is that window of opportunity where 2 servers might still be able to process at the same time.p  pIt appears that what I need is a single record in my Settings table which should store a boolean flag called LockInProgress. So before even a server can lock the needed records in the ProcessTable, it first must make sure that it has full rights to do the locking by checking the LockInProgress column in the Settings table.p  pSo my question is, how do I prevent two servers from both modifying that LockInProgress column in the settings table, at the same time... or am I going about this in the wrong manner p  pPlease note that I need to support both postgresql and ms sql server as some servers use one database, and some servers use the other.p  pThanks in advance...p

Negative 127 pI am trying to rip some text out of a large number of html documents numbers in the hundreds of thousands.  The documents are really forms but they are prepared by a very large group of different organizations so there is significant variation in how they create the document.  For example, the documents are divided into chapters.  I might want to extract the contents of Chapter 5 from every document so I can analyze the content of the chapter.  Initially I thought this would be easy but it turns out that the authors might use a set of nonnested tables throughout the document to hold the content so that Chapter n could be displayed using td tags inside a table.  Or they might use other elements such as p tags H tags, div tags or any other block level element.  p  pAfter trying repeatedly to use lxml to help me identify the beginning and end of each chapter I have determined that it is a lot cleaner to use a regular expression because in every case, no matter what the enclosing html element is the chapter label is always in the form ofp  precodegtChapter  codepre  pIt is a little more complicated in that there might be some white space or nonbreaking space represented in different ways nbsp or 160 or just spaces.  Nonetheless it was trivial to write a regular expression to identify the beginning of each section. The beginning of one section is the end of the previous section.p  pBut now I want to use lxml to get the text out.  My thought is that I have really no choice but to walk along my string to find the close tag for the element that encloses the text I am using to find the relevant section.  p  pThat is here is one example where the element holding the Chapter name is a divp  precodeltdiv styleDISPLAY block MARGINLEFT 0pt TEXTINDENT 0pt MARGINRIGHT 0pt alignleftgtltfont styleDISPLAY inline FONTWEIGHT bold FONTSIZE 10pt FONTFAMILY Times New RomangtChapter 1.amp160amp160amp160Our Beginnings.ltfontgtltdivgt codepre  pSo I am imagining that I would begin at the location where I found the match for chapter 1 and set up a regular expressions to find the next p  precodeltdivlttdltplth1 . . . codepre  pSo at this point I have identified the type of element holding my chapter headingp  pI can use the same logic to find all of the text that is within that element that is set up a regular expression to help me mark from p  precodegtChapter 1.amp160amp160amp160Our Beginnings.lt codepre  pSo I have identified where my Chapter 1 beginsp  pI can do the same for chapter 2 which is where Chapter 1 endsp  pNow I am imagining that I am going to snip the document beginning at the opening of the element that I identified as the element the indicates where chapter 1 begins and ending just before the opening of the element that I identified as the element that indicates where Chapter 2 begins.  The string that I have identified will then be fed to lxml to use its power to get the content.p  pI am going to all of this trouble because I have read over and over  never use a regular expression to extract content from html documents and I have not hit on a way to be as accurate with lxml to identify the starting and ending locations for the text I want to extract.  For example, I can never be certain that the subtitle of Chapter 1 is Our Beginnings it could be Our Red Canary.  Let me say that I spent two solid days trying with lxml to be confident that I had the beginning and ending elements and I could only be accurate lt60 of the time but a very short regular expression has given me better than 95 success.p  pI have a tendency to make things more complicated than necessary so I am wondering if anyone has seen or solved a similar problems and if they had an approach not the details mind you that they would like to offer.p

Negative 127 pI have a wpf app that needs to communicateexchange data with a custom designed device we can modify the code for the device. Do I have any options to connect to the device if it is behind a firewall via http I was hoping there would be a method where the admin would not have to forward any specific ports or do anything on his end. I assume the issue is how would I address the device from my app. I know SOAP over SMTP is one option. Is another option where the device could chatter out to my application via httpp

Negative 127 pI have been developing a project and in this project i have designed my code to do the same job after a specified time interval continuously. The job that wanted to be done has a lot of distinct cycles. The interval is small to execute them normally thus i used threads. Until that point everything is clear for me.p  pTo decrease the process and information transaction i wanted to put an session like object that holds the given data and provide it to any thread at anytime. With this object i plan to not query the same configuration information from database at everytime but if it exists on the session take it else query and store on session. p  pIm not sure how to implement this structure.p  pRegards,p

Negative 127 pIs there any way to check that my page is not opened in another tab or window in IE Say I have Page1 and user hits new window, which will open a new window with the same page opened. So now there are two instances of the page. I want to restrict the browser to only have one instance of the page opened at any given time.p  pOne of the requirements is that users must be able to refresh the page and still be in the same state inside the application. So onetime tokens are not suitable.p  pNot sure that there is any way to distinguish between a page refresh and a new window opened, thats why Im asking.p  pP.S. This is not for a normal website, and I understand that doing this usually would be intrusive and evil. There is a strong case to do this here, as it is a massive web application.p
Negative 127 pWe have a Spring application that uses Apache DBCP for connection pooling.  Our app has been in production for almost a year with no problems.  However, during the past few weeks, the application has frozen a number of times.  By frozen, I mean no requests are handled.  The problem is temporarily fixed by restarting the Glassfish domain that hosts the app.p  pWe are monitoring the memory heap  nonheap and CPU utilization of this application.  Nothing seems out of the ordinary here.  We have noticed however, that when we restart the domain, we get exception messages similar to the one at the bottom of this post in our log files.p  pI point out that we are using DBCP, because each of this NPEs reports the borrowObject method at the top of the stack.  Each of them occurs within the same millisecond during any application shutdown.p  pWe have noticed that there are a couple of these happening in the past a shutdown with such an NPE, but when the application freezes, there are always five.  This, we dont believe to be coincidental, is the same number of HTTPSSLWorkerThreads handling requests to the application.p  pIf anyone knows what is causing this, and how to fix it, help would be greatly appreciated.p

All three servers report the same binding errors for VJSharpCodeProvider and CppCodeProvider, but these seem to be normal as well and can be solved by not defining the DEBUG and TRACE constants during build.p  pWere running about 500 websites on each server identical, load balanced, of which 50 are under moderate load, the problem has arisen both under heavy load as well as under minimal load however.p  pRight now Im waiting for the errors to happen again so I can hopefully see a pattern and determine whether Load user profile alleviates the issue. Any suggestions in the meantime would be very welcome Also, I dont understand how the lack of Load user profile would cause an issue like this And even further, how it would seemingly work on R2 but not on plain 2008p  pThanksp

Negative 127 pReading a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions67299this questiona has helped me solidify some of the problems Ive always had with unittesting, TDD, et al.p  pSince coming across the TDD approach to development I knew that it was the right path to follow. Reading various tutorials helped me understand how to make a start, but they have always been very simplistic  not really something that one can apply to an active project. The best Ive managed is writing tests around small parts of my code  things like libraries, that are used by the main app but arent integrated in any way. While this has been useful it equates to about 5 of the codebase. Theres very little out there on how to go to the next step, to help me get some tests into the main app.p  pComments such as a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions67299comment2006643emMost code without unit tests is built with hard dependencies i.e.s news all over the place or static methods.ema and a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions67299answer67432em...its not rare to have a high level of coupling between classes, hardtoconfigure objects inside your class [...] and so on.ema have made me realise that the next step is understanding how to decouple code to make it testable.p  pWhat should I be looking at to help me do this Is there a specific set of design patterns that I need to understand and start to implement which will allow easier testingp

Negative 127 pI am looking for some advice. I have been developing for about 11 years on the Oracle EnterpriseOne platform and am now making the leap to c.

When you click the add button i would load a header screen no grid where you would enter all the order header info, common to all order detail records. When clicking OK to the header screen I would display a detail screen grid where you could add the multiple order detail records.p  pSo how do I do this in c ASP.NET 2.0 I would like to create an Ntier application.p  ol liI have created new classes OrdersHeader  Order Detail which match to my order header and order detail tables. li liI have created a new class OrdersDB which interacts with the order headerdetail classes and the database using ADO.NET and stored procedures.li liOn the landing screen I have created an ObjectDataSource pointing to OrdersDB and the SelectMothod... so this will return a collection of OrderDetails and allow the user to seach and select on existing orderdetails.li liI create a header screen when they click add which will contain a list of text boxes labels. When clicking OK I will create a instance of a new OrderHeader class from the values on screen and pass to the insert method of OrdersDB. is this correctli liOn the details screen which control should I use to let the user add order details I was assuming I could use the GridView which was set up to allow Inserting but when inquiring on an empty DB this is bringing back a blank grid and now allowing me to add new rows.li ol  pI hope thats clear enough. I am sure it is obvious what i need to do, but i think years of working in another platform has confused the issue for me.p

Negative 127 pI am planning to use SlopeOne algorithm to predict if a gamer can complete a given level in a Game or notp  pHere is the scenariop  ol liLots of Gamers play and try to complete 100 levels in the game.li liEach gamer can play a level as many times as they want until they cross the level.li liThe system keeps track of the level and the number of ReTries for each level.li liEach Game Level falls into one of the 3 categories Easy, Medium, Hardli liApproximate distribution of the levels is 33 across each category meaning 33 of the levels are Easy, 33 of the levels are Hard etc.li ol  pUsing this informationp  pWhen a new gamer starts playing the game, after a few levels, I want to be able to predict  which level can the Gamer Cross easily and which levels can heshe not cross easily.p  pwith this predictive ability I would like to present the game levels that the user would be able to cross with 50 probability.p  pCan I use SlopeOne algorithm for thisp  pReasoning is I see a lot of similarities between what I want to with say a movie rating system.p  pn users, m items and N ratings to predict user rating for a given item.p  pSimilarly, in my case, I havep  pn users, m levels and N Retries ...p  pThe only difference being in a movie rating system the rating is fixed on a 15 scale and in my case the retries can range from 1x x could be as high as 30p  pwhile theoretically someone could retry more 30 times, for now I could start with fixing the upper limit at 30 and adjust after I have more data.p  pThanks.p

Negative 127 pIm trying to make my first android game and to do this I made an OBJ loader which takes a resource id and uses the InputStream returned by Context.getResources.openRawResource.p  pI managed to read vertex information and face info and I can successfully load a mesh without any textures.p  pSee the problem is that the textures are not mapped correctly. I managed to read the information from the file by putting all the numbers after vt into an array as well as the indexes in f after the first  ie f 11 ...p  pIm not exactly sure what Im supposed to do with the numbers though...if I just put everything into a bytebuffer and continue as I normally would the way I learned from these two tutorialsa hrefhttpblog.jayway.com20091203openglestutorialforandroidparti relnofollowjaywaya, and the nehe ports it will still come out wrong.p  pMy thoughts are that the vt info in the file is out of orderhence the need for the x in the f data and Im supposed to put it in order somehow before creating the bytebuffer from the array....I dont know how to do that p  pSo I ask, can anyone offer me some help please I know there are other obj loaders out there on the internet but I already made this one and I know how it works, not only that but its a better learning experience for me.p  pHeres the code Im

Negative 127 pIm working on a DotNetNuke module in C, and in order to cut down on the amount of complexity I have elected to try and keep the configuration of the module in one page other than the standard Settings module.  I now wonder how wise of an idea that is.p  pMy module is a simple image gallery, with one or many images.  Each image has a title, an image source url and a destination another url.  Therefore, I figured that for my admin interface, I could have a simple grid of data where you can edit all of the existing entries or add a new one, all on the same page, sort of like thisp  pre Title              Image URL                           Anchor HREF [A Picture      ] [httpwww.example.comimage.jpg ] [httpwww.example.com] [Another Picture] [httpwww.example.comimage2.jpg] [httpwww.example.net] [                ] [                                 ] [                      ]pre  pLooking through WebControls, I found the GridView, which at first blush seemed like the sort of thing I was looking for.  However, taking a closer gander at it, I found that it needed to be bound directly to a data source, while it seems like the DotNetNuke standard of doing things in the Data Access Layer is to create a collection of data objects like sop  precode EditDiscovery.ascx.cs DiscoveryController objDiscoverys  new DiscoveryController ListltDiscoveryInfogt lstDiscoveries  objDiscoverys.GetDiscoverysModuleId   DiscoveryController.cs public ListltDiscoveryInfogt GetDiscoverysint ModuleId      return CBO.FillCollectionltDiscoveryInfogtDataProvider.Instance.GetDiscoverysModuleId  codepre  pIs there something Im missing with the GridView, or should I be changing the GetDiscoverys function to return a DataSet as opposed to a List of DiscoveryInfo objects  Or is there a better approach that does things that align better with DotNetNukes DALp
Negative 127 pIve created a DLL in Visual Studio that holds my Entity Framework codeObjectContextcode. Im trying to access its various codeObjectSetcodes from PowerShell.  Im doing this because I have some XML files that Im pulling from a web service and Id like to use PowerShells xml features automatic property generation, nonfatal null evaluation to map incoming xml values to Entities instead of having to use the C Xml classes.  Basically my PowerShell script is a data loader.p  pI am able to create and instantiate the ObjectContext just fine.  I can see all properties using code myObjectContext  GetMember MemberType Propertycode.  However, Im having trouble understanding when exactly items get returned from queries to the ObjectSet.p  pI know that in LinqtoEntities, there is lazy loading and that objects are only loaded when the collection is enumerated.  Ive tried calling extenion methods explicity, but it looks like PowerShell doesnt provide lambda expression support.p  pHeres my question.  How do I know when my queries are going to be explicitly enumerated  For example, heres one of the properties defined as codeObjectSetcodeltVehicleTypecode VehicleTypes  get code.  p  pcodePS myObjectContext.VehicleTypescodep  pProduces the following error, which Ill label as TheError for future referencep  pcodeformatdefault  Exception has been thrown by the target of an invocation.      CategoryInfo           Not Specified  [formatdefault], TargetInvocationException      FullyQualifiedErrorId  System.Reflection.TargetInvocationExceptioncodep  pBUT, codePS myObjectContext.VehicleTypes  SelectObject VehicleTypeIDcodep  pproduces the correct output a table of VehicleTypeIDsp  pHowever, codePS myObjectContext.VehicleTypes  SelectObject code gives TheError as described above.p  pcodePS myObjectContext.VehicleTypes  SortObjectcode always seems to enumerate the collection, which is understandable since it needs to look at all elements to compare them.p  pI should note that after the collection is enumerated once, calling codePS myObjectContext.VehicleTypescode does NOT give TheError above  it display the collection exactly as youd except.  This is really weird, but I think it has something to do with lazy loading which is why I mentioned it above.p  pCan anyone else confirmexplain this behavior to me, and maybe give me some pointers on best practices for using Entity Framework with PowerShellp  pAlso, if I do something like codePS myObjectContext.VehicleTypes  WhereObject .VehicleTypeID eq vehicleTypeIdcode is it going to be smart enough to execute that query server side, or is it going to fetch all records from the DB and return just the one Im looking for.  If the situation is the latter, I think I might be stuck with using C with its notsofriendly xml syntax for my data access.p

Negative 127 pI have a typical UITableView which displays a thumbnail image and some text.  During tableViewcellForRowAtIndexPath I start an async image download for each item in the list.  The images are downloading, but not the way I want.  For example, if I flick scroll the list, my download requests happen immediately, however, the connectionDidFinishLoading message will not get fired, until the scrolling from the flick scroll comes to a complete stop.  Basically, that results in the user seeing a bunch of empty images for a couple of seconds.p  pIf you look at the app store app, for example, when you flick scroll one of the lists, the images begin displaying even when scrolling hasnt stopped.  Im assuming this is due to some kind of multithreaded solution.  p  pCan someone please provide me with an example of how I can acheive the desired resultsp  pThanksp

Negative 127 pFor a Facebook Application, I have to store a list of friends of a user in my MySQL database. This list is requested from my db, compared with other data, etc.p  pCurrently, I store this list of friends within my user table, the uids of the friends are put together in one text field, with a  as separator. For examplep  blockquote   pID  UID  NAME  FRIENDS  1  123456789  John Doe  987654321123456765432p blockquote  pMy PHP file requests this row and extracts the list of friends by exploding that field . This all works fine, every 1000 users are about 5MB diskspace.p  pstrongNow the problemstrongp  pFor an extra feature, I also need to save the names of the friends of the user. I can do this in different waysp  p1 Save this data in an extra table. For examplep  blockquote   pID  UID  NAME  1  1234321  Jane Doep blockquote  pIf I need the name of the friend with ID 1234321, I can request the name from this table. However, the problem is that this table will keep growing, until all users on Facebook are indexed 500million rows. My webhost is not going to like this Such a table will take about 25GB of diskspace.p  p2 Another solution is to extend the data saved in the user table, by adding the name to the UID in the friends field with an extra separator, lets use ,. For examplep  blockquote   pID  UID  NAME  FRIENDS  1  123456789  John Doe  987654321,Mike Jones123456,Tom Bright765432,Rick Smithp blockquote  pFor this solution I have to alter the script, to add another extra explode ,, etc. Im not sure how many extra diskspace this is going to take... But the data doesnt get easy to handle this wayp  p3 A third solution gives a good overview of all the data, but will cause the database to be huge. In this solution we create a table of friends, with a row for every friendship. For examplep  blockquote   pID  UID  FRIENDUID  1  123456789  54321p      pID  UID  FRIENDUID  3  123456789  65432p      pID  UID  FRIENDUID  2  987654321  54321p      pID  UID  FRIENDUID  4  987654321  65432p blockquote  pAs you can see in this example, it gives a very good overview of all the friendships. However, with about 500million users, and lets say an average of 300 friendships per user, this will create a table with 150billion rows. My host is definitely not going to like that... AND I think this kind of table will take a lot of diskspace...p  pSo... How to solve this problem What do you think, what is the best way to store the UIDs  names of friends of a user on Facebook How to scale this kind of data Or do you have another better solution than the three possibilities mentioned abovep  pHope you can help mep

Id like to be generic if possible, cause I have a few other collections in the Application object to validate a subset of.p  pstrongEF Modelstrongp  precodepublic class Application      ...EF framework code...     public EntityCollectionltReferencegt References              get, set        public partial class Reference  EntityObject      public globalSystem.String FullName              get, set           public globalSystem.String Relationship              get, set           public globalSystem.String PhoneNumber              get, set           public globalint RelationshipLength radio button              get, set           public globalint ReferenceType radio button              get, set       codepre  pstrongReferenceMetaData.csstrongp  precode[MetadataTypetypeofReferenceMetadata] public partial class Reference    public class ReferenceMetadata      [DisplayFormatNullDisplayText  NA]     [DisplayNameFull Name]     public string FullName  get set       [DisplayFormatNullDisplayText  NA]     [DisplayNameReference Type]     public string ReferenceType  get set       [DisplayFormatNullDisplayText  NA]     [DisplayNameHow long have you known this person]     public string RelationshipLength  get set       [DisplayFormatNullDisplayText  NA]     [DisplayNameRelationship]     public string Relationship  get set       [DisplayFormatNullDisplayText  NA]     [DisplayNamePhone]     public string Phone  get set      ...more properites  codepre  pIm currently using Steven Sandersons RuleException and RulesViolationExceptionExtensions from a hrefhttprads.stackoverflow.comamznclick1430228865 relnofollowPro ASP.NET MVC 2 Frameworka to do server side validation manually as followsp  precodepublic static class ApplicationBusinessLogic      public static void RunServerValidationApplication app              var errors  new RulesExceptionltApplicationgt          for int i  0 i lt 3 i                       if string.IsNullOrEmptyapp.References.ElementAti.FullName                 errors.ErrorForx gt x.References.ElementAti.FullName, The Full Name for a first and second reference are required.             if app.References.ElementAti.ReferenceType  null                 errors.ErrorForx gt x.References.ElementAti.ReferenceType, The Reference Type for a first and second reference are required.             if app.References.ElementAti.RelationshipLength  null                 errors.ErrorForx gt x.References.ElementAti.RelationshipLength, The Relationship Length for a first and second reference are required.             if string.IsNullOrEmptyapp.References.ElementAti.Relationship                 errors.ErrorForx gt x.References.ElementAti.Relationship, The Relationship for a first and second reference are required.             if string.IsNullOrEmptyapp.References.ElementAti.Phone                 errors.ErrorForx gt x.References.ElementAti.Relationship, The Phone Number for a first and second reference are required.                   if errors.Errors.Any             throw errors        codepre  pI simply call that RunServerValidation method from the controller, catch the exceptions, and then copy them to ModelState. It works fine, but Im not sure how to handle this in the client side. If I used the [Required] metadata, all the 3 items in the collection will have those fields required. I just want 2 out of 3.p  pThe kludgey way Ive hooked up client validation is by specifying the dataval and datavalrequired attributes in the view while rendering the inputs like sop  precodefor int i  0 i lt 3 i      ViewData.TemplateInfo.HtmlFieldPrefix  Application.References[  i  ]         lth3gtReference ilth3gt     Html.ValidationMessageFormodel gt model.Application.References.ElementAti.FullName     ltdiv classeditorlabelgt         Html.LabelFormodel gt model.Application.References.ElementAti.FullName     ltdivgt                     ltdiv classeditorfieldgt            Html.TextBoxFormodel gt model.Application.References.ElementAti.FullName, new  maxlength  100, datavaltrue, datavalrequiredThe Full Name for a first and second reference are required.      ltdivgt      and so on for other properties...   codepre  pIt works, but this cant be ideal. Ive thought maybe I could make a generic ValidationAttribute, but Id imagine thatd be complex. I was thinking code[RequiredFieldsForFirstXCollectionItemsFirstXItems2, Fields new [] FullName, ReferenceType  etc ]code on the Application.References member, but Im not sure how to do that in a generic way. Am I on the right track with that thought though Then I could implement client side and server side that way, but it would be pretty complex code I think.p  pstrongUpdate 04262011strongp  pI think its probably better for me to add the client side validation using the jquery.Validation plugin in the document.ready function, rather than putting the dataval and datavalrequired html5 attributes on the input tags. Then at least I have a centralized place for my client validation. Heres what Ive donep  precodeEnd of Razor View file ltscript typetextjavascriptgt      function addValidationRules          references         for var i  0 i lt 2 i               ApplicationReferences  i  FullName.rulesadd,                  required true,                 messages                      required The Full Name for a first and second reference are required.                                           etc. for other properties         end forloop     end addValidationRules     document.readyfunction           addValidationRules         more js code...      ltscriptgt codepre  pOf course, when I get to using resource files for the error messages, it might get a little hairy if I decide to move the javascript into a .js file. I think if I keep the function in the view I should be able to read the resource file as needed.p

Negative 127 pRecently, I came across a hrefhttppyjs.orgpyjamasa framework. It encourages radically different web application development approach by seperating the whole view component of MVC into some html  javascript generated with compiled python, instead of using traditional templating. This client side view is supposed to communicate with the server through Asynchronous HTTP Requests, and the framework recommends using jsonrpc as communication protocol.p  pIn their documentation, they used a django based jsonrpc component. But I am mostly used to simple and stupid solutions like a hrefhttpbottlepy.orgbottle frameworka. As far as I understand, I dont even need all the components of such microframeworks. A WSGI compatible server, some routing  session middleware and a request handler which understands in terms of jsonrpc will do just fine. I am looking for an easy to use light weight solution for the last part  readily available jsonrpcaware request handler that plugs nicely in WSGI environment.

At least to the extent that the expression tree can be mapped back to the database.p  pBut in Code First, the type of the property must be codebyte[]code. And two arrays cant be compared with the regular comparison operators. Is there some other way to write the comparison of the arrays that LINQ to Entities will understand Or to coerce the arrays into other types so that the comparison can get past the compilerp

Negative 127 pI need to synchronize my user table with repositorythe other DB during application startup. I have two Tomcat nodes with Apache modjk.

It seems like T1 begin  T2 begin T1 read the data T2 read the data T1 modify the data T2 modify the same data T1 insert T2 insert T1 commit T2 commitp  pWhen T1 modifies the data and then T2 modifies the same data I have lost update. And of course I have duplicates during insert operation. How should I do the synchronizationp  ol liI suppose I can lock all the table using select  for update for instance and perform two synchronizations. One full and the other one empty.li liI can create special table for this and put STATUS colum there. When one node starts it performs SELECT FOR UPDATE of the STATUS field and changes it to RUNNING. When the other transaction reads the STATUS it doesnt perform synchronization if its set to RUNNING.li ol  pWhats the best solution Any other suggestions. Thanksp

Heres an excerpt from apple docsp  blockquote   pA run loop is an event processing loop that you use to schedule work and coordinate the receipt of incoming events. The purpose of a run loop is to keep your thread busy when there is work to do and put your thread to sleep when there is none.p blockquote  pIMHO, more or less your are dealing with the same task  how to call your method on separate thread for its async operation. p  pUPDATE2 Already had some experience with NSInvocationOperation and NSOperationQueue and IMHO its quite convenient. According to Apple docs, GCD and NSOperations are a preferred way for implementing multithreading. And also, NSOperations runs on GCD starting from iOS 4.0. In short, you instantiate NSIvocationOperation as a call to your method then instantiate NSOperationQueue and add invocation to the queue. NSOperationQueue is smart thing enough, you can instantiate multiple NSIvocationOperation objects wrapping your method calls and them to NSOperationQueue. The rest is assured. NSOperationQueue determines  how much parallel threads it need to perform the calls NSInvocationOperation and handles it for you. It might execute first call on thread A, then second on thread B, third on thread C and forth on thread B, so you do not have to worry about that. But if you want, you may tell how max threads NSOperationQueue can use for performing calls for example 1 but I have no need for that. By default, all tasks are performed on other than main thread, so operation queues are asynchronous by default. Also, if you want to perform your method calls each wrapped in separate NSInvocationOperation in a strict queue then you can add dependencies and so NSOperationQueue will preserve method call order. Heres an examplep  precode wrap your method call into NSInvocationOperation object NSInvocationOperation currentOperation  [[NSInvocationOperation alloc] initWithTargetself selectorselectoryourMethodCall objectnil]   sharedOperationQueue is a shared NSOperationQueue   get all executing operations from the queue and get the last operation lastOperation  [[sharedOperationQueue operations] lastObject]   check if lastOperation is not nil if lastOperation        if not then add dependency, so the calls would be performed in a queue     [currentOperation addDependencylastOperation]    say  execute my method operation [sharedOperationQueue addOperationcurrentOperation]  lastOperation  currentOperation  mark as last operation for adding dependency to the next operation   the queue will retain invocation operation so you will release [currentOperation release]   ..... you can create another NSInvocationOperation and add it to the queue.... codepre  pAs for RUNLOOPs, still, sometimes you will face them, for example when startingscheduling a timer, or making NSURL connections. IMHO, a runloop might be compared to a queue of tasks  executed on one thread. IMHO a runloop is a pointer to a thread that operates as a queue it has tasks that might throw events and they will be placed at the end of the queue in that thread. By default all tasks in your app run in a single runloop  in a single thread. Im saying its a pointer because when your app generates events then the app must know where to put that event touch event or other delegate callback for execution. Of course, you should read about runloops for more detailed information because these are just my thoughts.p

Negative 127 pI have a range of similar pages that have a URL along the lines of codewww.mydomain.comgroupid1code.p  pFrom each of these pages there is a form that posts its values to the server. I need to work out what the codeidcode of the group was when the form is posted. Im aware of being able to use codeSERVER[HTTPREFERER]code and then maybe I could use a regex to get the codeidcode. However, I wondered if there was anything in PHP that would allow you to get the previous GET variablesp  pAlternatively, do people think it is a much better idea to store the current group id as a session variablep

I was expecting this to solve my problem, but so far, no luck. I suppose I could just rewrite it using foreach instead of bagof I believe this would take care of the problem, but Id also like to know what is causing the trouble  I feel confident that this is indeed where the error is occurring, as the answers being returned are correct other than the fact that boxes do not necessarily contain each number exactly once. p  pEDIT After some careful tracing, Ive come across the problem still no solution though. It is not, as I feared above, bagof attempting to constrain new variables as opposed to the ones passed in  it handles that fine. Rather, the problem lies with bagof generating a list of singleton lists, rather than a list of sublists each of length K for a KxK board. When I switch to findall, this problem goes away, so I believe it has something to do with how bagof is executed.

Negative 127 pI have a large scale project I am working on at the moment using Eclipse.  Normally, as a one man team, these problems would not be an issue, but as our team is not one person we need to be able to break up pieces of the project to be worked on by certain team members.p  pIn simplicity, lets say I have two layers to be separated apart 1. Each DAO is a separate Java project, to be worked upon individually 2. The webtier service layer contains all of our service endpoints and must be able to reference all of the DAOs.  This layer runs on Tomcat as a dynamic web project, and utilizes Adobe LiveCycle Data Services as the piece that handles creation and management of endpoints.p  pNow, the issue we are running into is that when we create a DAO and unit test it individually it runs great.  But when we reference it into our service project and try to run it we begin to get all kinds of issues related to the fact that we have two different versions of certain jars referenced in and as such we begin to have errors when running the server.p  pAs a result, we know we can solve the issue by pulling the problem jars and ensuring that this is not an issue again in the future, but as I said before this is a large scale project with multiple people working on it and we dont want to be spending our time weeding out dependency issues when under the gun.p  pWe are looking for recommendations on where to proceed for alternative solutions  Our team is new to JavaEE and as such we dont have much of a bearing on what we can use to tie everything together in it, or if it is a viable solution.  Should we be looking at turning our DAOs into EJBs and deploying them in an EAR library  If so, where would our service layer lie, and would the service layer be able to reference the DAO classes since the EJB maintains its own classpath from what we have read  Are we looking down the wrong path, or are we completely wrong in our current understanding of JavaEEp  pAny assistance is greatly appreciated.  We are still in the framework stage of this project and we want to be sure that we will be able to maintain it in the long run.p

Negative 127 pThe following code just brings up a canvas in a window which just fills its content with red. However, when resizing the window it flickers a lot, because before each repaint the canvas appears to clear itself.

Negative 127 pAssuming that my character is falling, and headed toward some sprite platform, and I flag that my character has landed once a collision is detected, what is the best way to reset my characters position  so that he is above the platforms rectangle or so that he is still clipping it  p  pMy concerns are that if my character is above the platforms rectangle, than my function fall will be called because he isnt touching anything, and if my character is clipping the platforms rectangle, than my jump function may be hindered, because it may think hes landed as soon as he takes off. Obviously there are work arounds for either, but Im really just looking for the convention, if there is one.p  pI can post code if necessary, but the code isnt the issue.  Im really just looking for the right method   p  pThanks,p  pMikep

Negative 127 pA piece of C Ive been asked to look at is performing poorly due to an inordinate number of invocations of new on objects we use to store information about a node in an XML DOM tree. Ive verified that new is the cause, using both AQTime and Very Sleepy profilers.p  pThese objects all contain several other object types and pointers to objects as members, so each new on a node object will invoke the constructors of all the member objects as well, which I guess is the reason each allocation takes so long. It also means we cant just call something like GlobalAlloc and request a big chunk of memory  it needs to be initialised afterwards. p  pIve been investigating using preallocation techniques to mitigate this poor performance, but the ones Ive seen involve requesting big chunks of uninitialised memory which isnt suitable for what I need, while others ultimately end up calling new anyway, cancelling out any performance gain we might observe so Im wondering if there is another option Im unaware of I have a feeling what Im asking for cant be done, that its either retrieving uninitialised memory quickly or initialised memory slowly. Please prove me wrong p  pThanksp

Negative 127 pThanks in advance for any help.p  pI am posting form values to multiple dynamically generated iframes, and want the content of each iframe to remain, as I post to another dynamically generated iframe.p  pAs you can see by my example  even just dynamically creating and adding a new iframe via innerHTML , causes the previously generated iframes to refresh.p  pThis is not the case if I do not use javascript to create the iframes  if I just write the html ahead of time and post to the already existing iframes, there is not any refresh problem. The previously posted iframes will remain with the posted content.p  pI do not know how many iframes I will need  so that is why I am using javascript to dynamically generate the iframes.p  pI am aware that I could use AJAX for this same purpose, but I am not using AJAX for this.p  pI just need to know why the iframes are refreshing, regardless of there content, when I am dynamically adding another iframe via Javascript and stronginnerHTMLstrongp  pIs there a way to achieve this without the iframes refreshingp  pWith my example  I am only showing that the iframes are refreshing.

Negative 127 pIve always wondered, when you cast an object pointer to its base class, what exactly happens to the memory I presume that the memory storing all the member functions and variables in the sub class are still there, just offlimits now.

Does this mean the memory for the polymorphic relationship is handled differentlyp  pAnd how do things like private, protected and even virtual inheritance work in relation to thisp

Negative 127 pI have an EntityJSF Managed Bean codeTicketcode that represents a helpdesk ticket.p  pIt has a codestatuscode property when the status is set to codeclosedcode I want to change the value of the codeclosingDatecode property to the current system time. But I think that code should be contained in the bean, as each time the ticket is closed the time should be recorded.p  pWhat would be the proper way to manage it I have several ideas.p  ol liMake setter of codecreationTimecode private, and change its value when the  codestatuscode setter is called. Fast and quick, but makes a setter change two attributes. Also, forces me to use JPA field access not much of a problem as I am already using it, but still a limitation and I am not clear of what will happen when the bean is serialized.li liMake the codestatuscode property a bound property as described in JavaBeans, and make the class a codePropertyChangeListenercode to itself. Very formal, but a little overcomplicated to my likening.li liMake setters for both properties private, and add a nonbean method codeclosecode that performs both actions. I would go this way but it can make me it complicated to work with JSF.li liDo nothing. Keep the bean as dumb as it can and move the logic to the controller cross my fingers hoping that nobody forgets to update both attributes.li ol  pI favour 1 or 3, but I would like to know if there is a better approach.p

Negative 127 pIve finally managed to implement Thread.interrupt into my program instead of Thread.stop. I am however not sure that Ive done this well.p  pI have a class which extends Thread and declares several methods. strongEVERYstrong method has been made to throw InterruptedException Each method performs IO intensive operations, some of which take several minutes to complete, I have therefore not used a threadsafe flag as the flag would not get checked until after the operation completed. I have also added the following code at several places within these methods to throw the exceptionsp  precodeif this.isInterrupted throw new InterruptedException codepre  pWithin the run method I execute all methods within a trycatch for InterruptedException. If caught, I execute Process.destroy and BufferedReader.close for my class variables.p  pThis all works, and seems to work very well, however I have a couple of questionsp  ol liIs it correct to have more than 10 methods, all of which throw InterruptedException Is there a better way to do thisli liIs it correct to bloat the methods with checks for isInterruptedli liAt the end of the catch InterruptedException block, must I execute a return, or null certain values to make the Thread available for GC If I recreate the Thread it takes longer than usual to initialize.li liFinally, are there any issuesenhancements related to what Ive doneli ol  pThanks in advance for your helpp
Negative 127 pAs far as I could get, with an fxml file you can abstract your user interface design or any other class actually within a fxml configuration file and load it after. On the other hand, with Spring configuration one could define the DI for the application. So, Im trying to figure out how to combine this together.p  pExample,suppose I have a scene where 4 graphs are displayed. Now I want to display a 5th one. To do so, theoretically should I add an entry to my spring.xml configuration file to inject a new graph and additionally add a new entry into my fxml file do set this new graph design configurationp  pIm trying to have a broad understand of how this would work so Im sorry if my question lacks some technical accuracy.p

So I, need help regarding this.p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.com12j7k.png altAllocationp  pBasically, headers are ARC compatible. Source code does not support ARC. So, you compile Cocos2D as a static lib without enabling ARC and then you link to it in your code in which you can safely use ARC for your classes and custom subclasses of Cocos2D elements. Please correct me if I am wrong, but there should be no problem with using ARC in your project and have say a CCSprite subclass which uses ARC and does not manually place retain and release messages.

In order to standardize movement speeds on objects, Ive been dividing the increment by the FPS so that it will increment that total amount in a one second timeframe.p  pI have the following code. What I want to do it make it so that codemap.addEntitycode is not called 300 or 400 times per second, in accordance with the FPS but rather make it so that I can choose, for example, to make the projectile fire at 10 RPS or so.

Negative 127 pBefore diving into the question itself, please understand, that I am not in control of the whole food chain here  answers or comments of the you are doing it wrong kind wont help, as I need to develop against a given API.p  pComponents, that communicate chunks of raw data, most often do so via buffers of type codebyte[]code or codeArraySegmentltbytegtcode.

Nothing new here.p  pThis comes at a price though A possibly foreign, closedsource component consuming an codeArraySegmentltbytegtcode gets a reference and thus access to the complete array, meaning, that if it misbehaves it has the ability to corrupt completly unrelated buffers. p  pNowp  ul liAn extensive search revealed no mechanism to expose strongonlystrong a part of an existing array as a complete array, a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions5756692arraysegmentreturningtheactualsegmentcsharpthis SO questiona was the closest I got, still not usable as it is not an array. li liInheriting from codeSystem.Arraycode is not supported.li liInheriting from codeSystem.ArraySegmentltTgtcode is not supported either.li ul  pMy chain of questions is answering one obsoletes the later onesp  ul liIs there a tricky way to present a selfdeveloped wrapper as a codebyte[]code to a foreign consumerli liOr is there a tricky way to present a selfdeveloped wrapper as an codeArraySegmentltbytegtcode to a foreign consumer, that will not expose the complete underlying arrayli liAlternativly, is there a way to inherit from codeSystem.Arraycode, that I missedli liAgain alternativly Is there a way to create a codebyte[]code from an aleady allocated and pinned memory region, that I have missed, that will not screw up, if it is GCedli ul  pstrongEditstrongp  pFrom the comment I take, I didnt say it expressivly enough.

So far Ive run into two problems.p  pProblem 1. In addition to the columns I set up in XAML in the nested DG, each property of the data source shows up as a column as well. I initially had to set their visibility to Collapsed in the code behind, but when editing this post, I found out that I can simply set AutoGenerateColumns to False to get rid of the extra columns.p  pProblem 2. The TextBlock element in row 0 and column 0 of each and every of the nested Datagrid has the focus retangle around them. I wonder why and how to turn them off if possible. They dont disappear even if I click on other areas of the UI.  p  pScreenshot sorry not enough rep to embed image in the post yet a hrefhttpxyk.iwebs.wsnestedDGtextBlockhighlight.JPG relnofollowhttpxyk.iwebs.wsnestedDGtextBlockhighlight.JPGap

Negative 127 pI have a soap webservice providingcarrying information between a partner and supplier. Basically, WS is a connector as a hub between these two. It carries and converts the data between parner and supplier. It receives an order request from parner which has also payment data then It converts that request in the format of the supplier with payment data and transfer through their system. So that makes the service not PCI Compliant. I would like to have a solution in between which helps me that my service shouldnt struggle for PCI and takes the responsibility from me. Is there any 3rd party solution can be in between I am willing to pay for the service or can I achieve it myself As I researched, PCI requires many different things and cost is high. So it takes time and money. what can be quick, short term solution and long term solution if neededp  pThanks.p

Negative 127 pI have a simple build system for a project that Ive put together using a hrefhttpscons.org relnofollowSConsa. The project has quite a few source files, and I thought it would be userfriendly to display some sort of progress information as the build is progressing. SCons provides construction variables like codeCXXCOMSTRcode that I can override to control what gets displayed to the terminal during each of the build steps. For instance, instead of seeing something likep  precodegcc file.c o file.o codepre  pIt would be nice to have something likep  precode[110] Compiling file.c gcc file.c o file.o codepre  pWhere the code[110]code specifies that this is the first of ten targets that are being updated during this build. Is there any way to access this information so that I can generate messages like this It seems like I would need to know the total number of targets that are being updated which is based upon the dependency scanning that SCons does and some way of enumerating each one. I know that similar behavior is similar with other build systems like CMake and waf, but havent come across anything in SConss expansive documentation.p

After popover is opened its inner size without margins is 66 px measured with the help of Ruler app. So, it seems that it should fit exactly to the size of content view. But unexpected vertical scrolling appears somehow.p  pThan, if I add 20 px to the height of popover,  code[mOptionPopoverController setPopoverContentSizeCGSize200, 86]code than its content view also increases and fits as expected, without any scrollers.

Negative 127 pIm implementing webgl picking from scratch, and have decided to go down the GLSL route, as oppose to ray intersection testing. p  pso Im rendering the whole scene into a separate frame buffer, assigning each object a unique color which is passed to the fragment shader as a uniform variable.  when the scene is rendered then I gl.readPixels the buffer, and get the color values at the click coordinates I invert the coord system to account for GL differing from the browsers coord system. p  pthe issue Im having is that shaders represent colors passed to the glFragColor shader output as vec4 floats with 0.01.0 range per color channel, whereas gl.readPixels returns color channels as integers in the 0255 range... doing this translation loses some precision, and might create picking errors if there are a lot of objects in the scene more then 255, or if the integertofloat rounding is larger then the granularity needed to differentiate between different object IDs. p  pdoes anyone have an idea how to resolve this, or point me in the right direction can readPixels return float values for color channels in the 0.01.0 range can I pack a single object ID spread over multiple channels so that Im not limited to a single channel and only being able to pick 255 objectsp  pthank you for your helpp

Negative 127 pI find the Edit amp Continue feature is a great advantage if you develop an ASP.NET project. The only problem I run into is that if I want to use Edit amp Continue, I need to start the debugger and run the code in the ASP.NET Development Server. When I want to stop debugging for a moment, the server stops and the web app is not available anymore  Logic.p  pI would like to be able to start the server with the Edit amp Continue feature, but not attach the debugger to the process yet. After some actions login, filling a form etc, I want to attach the debugger to the process and be able to break at breakpoints and use the Edit amp Continue feature.p  pIt does work to start the server without debugging mode and as soon as I attach to the development server process, it does break, but by that time, the Edit amp Continue does not work anymore. It tells mep  precodeChanges are not allowed in the following cases   When the degbugger has been attached to an already running process.   The code being debugged was optimized at build or run time.   The assembly being debugged is loaded as domainneutral.   The assembly being debugged was loaded through reflection.   When Intellitrace events and call information is enabled. codepre  pIs there a way to attach later and have a working Edit amp Continuep  pWhy do I want this Imagine that I have a lot of breakpoints in my code and dont want to disable them one by one, but I would like to attach to the server process only after I have made some actions login, filling out a form etc, in order to prevent that I need to continue on each break. Once I am just before my action I need to debug, I want to attach and then be able to edit the code without the need of restarting the web server and doing all the actions all over again.p  pI hope I was clear enough...p

Negative 127 pI have a list of lists and want to get an iterator over every element in every list. p  pMy idea is to write a class with two variables The iterator over the lists and the iterate over the current inner list.

My way of doing this contains a lot of nested ifs in the next function so Im asking you what the pythonic way of doing this is.p  pExamplep  precodelists  [[1, 2].iter, [3, 4].iter] codepre  pNow I need an iterator object that iterates over 1, 2, 3 and 4. Because the lists Im working with are very big I can only use iterators. p

Negative 127 pIm currently working on a 2D game engine with SFML, and started off procedurally but decided It will be better in the long run by moving it to OOP. I understand the concept of OOP, however, Im not exactly sure where I should define my instantiations to the other classes ImageManager, Grid, etc.p  pFor example, My codeEnginecode class depends on codeImageManagercode, and many functions in codeEnginecode rely on variables from codeImageManagercode. Thus, I cant simply declare and define the instance of the codeImageManagercode class within a single function, since It wont be available in the other functions.p  pWhat Ive done is this Engine.hp  precodeclass Engine  private     sfRenderWindow window     grid gridArray[SIZE]     ...more variables, removing for length     Initializes the engine     bool Init Main Game Loop     void MainLoop Renders one frame     void RenderFrame Processes user input     void ProcessInput Updates all Engine internals public     Engineint w, int h, int tileSize     Engine     ImageManager  imageManager     GridClass  gridClass     ...removed some methods for length  codepre  pSo basically, you can see Im declaring two classes in the header, codeImageManagercode and codeGridClasscode.  Inside Engine.cppp  precodeEngineEngineint w, int h, int tileSize      imageManager  new ImageManager     gridClass  new GridClass     gridArray  new grid[SIZE][SIZE]     masterArray  new unsigned char[MAPSIZE][MAPSIZE]     videoSize  sfVector2iw, h     thisgttileSize  tileSize     startX  startY  endX  endY  0  codepre  pIm defining the classes. I do it in the constructor because Im not sure where Im supposed to do it, to conform with good practices.  Ive been having problems with the elements of codeimageManagercode becoming corrupted, so Im wondering if the way Im doing it is a bad idea or not.p  pIf its a bad idea, could you please tell me where I should instantiate these classes Remember that many functions within Engine rely on variables from these instances of these classes, and I dont really want to pass a LOT of parameters to each function.p  pThanks.p

Negative 127 pWhy does Java throw an exception when you call a method on a null object From what I understand, exceptions indicate some recoverable error. However, I cant see a situation where you would wrap a method call in a codetrycode block, and then catch the codeNullPointerExceptioncode. Couldnt you just check whether the object is codenullcode before making the method call It seems like if you try to call a method on a null reference, the program should abort and crash immediately, since that indicates a programmer error rather than a recoverable error.p

Negative 127 pI am working on a server of which TFS 2012 was installed.  Other than TFS 2012, there is also Visual studio 2010 and Visual Studio 2012 in the server. I would like to know if there is any way I can get a list of the work space in the local directory on that serverp  pWhat I want to do is, I want to run batch job which uses TF.exe to retrieve the latest sources code from TFS and put them into a directory. However, when I run the TF.exe command, I always got an error message Unable to determine the source control server.p  pI research on the internet and I saw that I need to create workspace and mapped the workspace into a local directory, and then I can run TF.exe on that mapped directory.p  pActually, I can create a new workspace and do a new mapping on my own. But I am afraid doing so may affect some existing setting for I am completely new to TFS, I dont know what will be the impact be for adding new workspace and new mapping. So it would be much better if I can see if there are any existing workspacemapping in that server.p  pCould anyone please help, or give me your advice under my scenariop

It doesnt allow duplicate images to be written to the filesystem, which Im happy with.  I want to make sure that the name of an image is only added once to the database.

In Visual Studio which is confusing when you look at the value of a string in the debugger, it puts escapes in for you, so a doublebackslash in a watch window or variable value popup is normal and does not mean there are actually two backslashes.  When you mouseover the variable or watch it in the watch window, click the magnifying glass icon at the right hand side of the tooltippane, this will show you the unescaped string at it would be printed to the console. Another way to display the actual results is Console.WriteLinetheproblemstring   The issue I was having with the code is outside the scope of the post but the confusion of the results I was seeing from Visual Studio lead me to believe the string was the source of the problem when it wasnt.  p

The add tag button needs to perform a different action based on whether the text field is open or closed, but because I can only achieve 1 with an onblur event on the text field, the text field is closed by the time any action happens on the add tag button for 3.p  pHere is a a hrefhttpjsfiddle.nettobeknKAGh2 relnofollowJSFiddle with my best attempt so fara.p

Negative 127 pI have a problem binding data from an external HTTP API. I tried to follow best practices and tried several approaches reading the Internet and SO, but the magic of databinding doesnt work and I cant findunderstand why. Heres the code p  precodeangular.modulemyApp, []     .serviceexternalAPI, [q, functionq          var data  [], deferred  q.defer           The HTTP calls are made through the provided SDK lib          It uses promises too         var pullData  function              externalLib.getsomePath.thenfunctionnewData                   I expect this assignment to help the databinding                 data  newData                 deferred.resolvenewData                          return deferred.promise                   return              data data,             pullData pullData              ]     .controllermyController, [scope, externalAPI, functionscope, externalAPI           Here I tried a lot of approaches to make the magic of databinding works, with no luck           1. Bind the whole service, so that externalAPI.data is always updated in templates         scope.externalAPI  externalAPI         externalAPI.pullData           2. Bind and expose just the data         scope.data  externalAPI.data         externalAPI.pullData           3. Do 1  watch the whole externalAPI object          Note I put console.log calls inside the first function, it always return the initial version         scope.externalAPI  externalAPI         scope.watchfunction  return externalAPI , functionnewVersion              scope.externalAPI  newValue                  externalAPI.pullData           4. Do 2  watch just the data of the externalAPI         scope.data  externalAPI.data         scope.watchfunction  return externalAPI.data , functionnewData              scope.data  newData                  externalAPI.pullData           5. Only thing that works fine  manually wire scope data from the call         scope.data  externalAPI.data         externalAPI.pullData.thenfunctionnewData              scope.data  newData              ] codepre  pManually wiring as in 5 defeats the purpose of databinding, since I will be using the externalAPI service and pulling data from other parts of the app, and I want this data to always be fresh and reflected in the UI. What did I do wrong p  pNote Im using Angularsjs 1.2.5, no jQuery or other js lib, just the SDK lib to access data I have to, it does several unrelated but necessary things in the background.p

Negative 127 pWhen I first started to learn php I understood that it was good practice to store the db connection file in my root folder, and include it once at the top of every file. The settings would carry throughout the file and work inside functions etc  so the same file was a good place to store global variables.p  pNow Im finally updating my code  working on a new project, and I know the mysql functions are depreciated and I ought to be using PDO or MySQLi.

Whats the best way to solve this Get two ranges and apply some intersection algorithm Just get one range and iterate through, only keeping the relevant points Or is there some way to do a compound select with boost multiindexp  pHere is a MWE that defines and populates the multiindex with uniformly random points and queries a random point by x.p  precodeinclude ltboostmultiindexcontainer.hppgt include ltboostmultiindexmember.hppgt include ltboostmultiindexorderedindex.hppgt include ltalgorithmgt include ltiostreamgt include ltiteratorgt include ltstringgt include ltrandomgt include ltchronogt  using boostmultiindexcontainer using namespace boostmultiindex  struct nodePosition      int id     double x     double y     nodePositionint id, double x, double yidid,xx,yy      friend stdostreamamp operatorltltstdostreamamp os,const nodePositionamp np              osltltnp.idltlttltltnp.xltlttltltnp.yltltstdendl         return os         struct id struct x struct y  typedef multiindexcontainerlt     nodePosition,     indexedbylt         ordereduniquelt             tagltidgt, BOOSTMULTIINDEXMEMBERnodePosition,int,idgt,         orderednonuniquelt             tagltxgt, BOOSTMULTIINDEXMEMBERnodePosition,double,xgt,         orderednonuniquelt             tagltygt, BOOSTMULTIINDEXMEMBERnodePosition,double,ygt gt gt nodeset  unsigned seed1  stdchronosystemclocknow.timesinceepoch.count stddefaultrandomengine enseed1 stduniformrealdistributionltdoublegt rf0.0,1.0   int main  nodeset ns  int N1000  double r0.01  stduniformintdistributionltintgt ri0,N  forint i0 iltN i      ns.insertnodePositioni,rfen,rfen    int ind  rien  auto itns.getltidgt.findind  stdcoutltltit  auto itx2ns.getltxgt.upperbounditgtxr  auto itx1ns.getltxgt.lowerbounditgtxr  for auto ititx1 ititx2 it      stdcoutltltit    return 0  codepre

Negative 127 pI have a photo editing app. All it does is add images onto a base photo. The output photo is lower quality than the original photo which is taken by the camera. This is expected, but maybe I can improve on what I currently have. Its the same quality at 500px as 1000px which is very concerning... I can see Im limiting quality somewhere other than pixels. The original photos in my camera gallery are JPG files. Here is everything I do to get the photo, create the bitmap from it, and then save it.

In the following code, I send a message to the parent of this object without specifying its class. If I dont typecast the parent ivar, the compiler issues a warning.

The same is true if I use codeperformSelectorwithObjectcodep  pIf the method on the parent is different to codeuserSelectedcode then the only thing that works is codeperformSelectorcode while issuing a warning.p  pAs I understand it, ARC is getting the method signature from the object the call to self.parent is made.

I have also compared the results of codeumatrix  vec4aposition, 0.0, 1.0code with the clip space position that i passed, and it turns out that they are emalmostem equal to the clip space coordinates that i pass in from the cpu side. in fact, i did the perspective division on both and then emitted codevec41vec4absdifference.xyz20.0,0.0code as a color  it was barely differentiable from white, so the difference is very small, i guess just different floating point arithmetics.p  pany idea whats going on scissor, depth and stencil tests are disabled, near and far planes of the camera are fine, backface culling is disabled. Feel free to ask for more detail...p  pupdate1 if i tilt the cam to not look exactly in Z, i get the same artifact, but it looks like nearplaneclipping now i can zoom in to a state where only half the screen is blank. But i have no idea how this can happen my near plane is set to 20 meters but the artifact happens at a camera lt z0 plane distance of 1300 meters.p

Negative 127 pSo this question follows on from a previous post that I am just trying to understand in full before I move on to more complicated C stuff. p  pMy question relates specifically to the return value of a function. p  pConsider the following function code p  precodepublic static void DisplayResultint PlayerTotal, int DealerTotal         if PlayerTotal gt DealerTotal              Console.WriteLine You Win             Console.ReadLine                     else if DealerTotal gt PlayerTotal              Console.WriteLine Dealer Wins             Console.ReadLine           else              Console.WriteLine It is a Draw             Console.ReadLine           codepre  pI could be wrong of course but I believe that the void keyword in the first line of code means that the function code result does NOT return a value. p  pWhat I am trying to understand is  the function calculates a result. It distributes text eg you win etc based on the result. Is the result of the function not considered a value p  pBy my own novice logic, I would have thought one of two things p  ol liThe return value of this function is a string because it is the output of the calculated result. li liThe return value of this function is an int because it calculates int results. li ol  pI hope this makes sense. I think understanding this concept will make it easier for me in future to write functions without second guessing return values. If anyone has an example of a function that actually DOES return a value it would also be appreciated. p

Negative 127 pSo my goal is to create a function that will first try to load a package. If it cannot be loaded it will then try to install it and then load it. I saw this type of code somewhere and I used it in a couple of my  functions, where I always specified the necessary packages within the functions. I figured this would be a nice tool to generalize into a function. There are so many packages I often forget what I already have installed. p  pThe issue is that in lib and lib2 it passing the name of the objectcodepackagecode and not the name of the contents of the object codeSpatialPackcode. Ive tried a few things like specifying the location within the object codepackage[1]code, but that did nothing. p  pAny help in getting it to call to the content of the object, and not the name of the object would be awesome.

Negative 127 pI am trying to update content of my page for printing. I want to have labels spans for each input element textboxes, lists, etc. to prevent textcutoff when printing. I want to make sure before printing that all these labels reflect the most uptodate user entered values from their respective input fields.p  pMy first idea was to just put a label after each textbox, and bind it with the same value on page render, and then hideshow the input or the label based on CSS media attribute. But then I also need to have codeonchangecode handlers for every input element to update its respective label every time its value is changed.p  pMy next thought was to use codeonbeforeprintcode and some jQuery to update the labels on the fly with the current values all in one spot. Cleaner, centralized, more concise code. p  pBut as far as I can tell, codeonbeforeprintcode and codeonafterprintcode are only supported in IE and Firefox. ... BUT ... every article or post I can find that talks about browser support for these two functions is from a good 4 or 5 years, or even more ago p  pSo Im wondering, have Chrome and Safari added support for these two functions at any point in the past 5 yearsp

Negative 127 pI have fairly modest requirements, yet I cannot seem to make any mainstream Java IDE fulfill themp  ul liI want to create a web application, which I will want to either deploy on Linux server, or package as installable Windows executableli liFor the views part, I thought Id use Vaadin  so I dont have to edit 23 files for every change HTML,CSS,Controller, only 1.li liI like Java type checking, but in some cases I can do without it, and use Groovy as part of sources to code faster.  It would be nice, but doesnt have to have the Groovy classes automatically recompile upon edit, if the entire project can compile in seconds.li liI want my sources modular, i.e. have a bunch of small modules for simple things like excel import, statistical calculations, etc separated from the main source. So, each module will have its own test directories with Java and Groovy test cases, plus there will be a common integration one for the application.li liI want all my tests to run within max 5 seconds of overhead on my laptop dual core. So, Grails is unfortunately a nogo, also because of its instability, but thats another story.li liI would love it if some tests are automatically rerun, only those that are using the codebase I just changed.li liI need to connect it to a Continuous Integration server like Jenkins, to run upon my Git commits.li ul  pSo far, when I tried to do all that in Netbeans 8, GGTS 3.5, and IdeaU 13, using standard Create New Project options a Vaadin7 app templateconvert to Groovy appconvert to Maven project, something was always amiss  tests were not recognized or run, groovy syntax was not being propery checkedhighlighted for problems, maven build would not run, some classes would not be found even though the same package was used, JVM or GGTS would crash in the middle, there would be no autocompletion for several things, etc. And, after I made it build under one IDE, trying to import that project into another would result in a complete mess  some parts of the code being invisible to the build or tests, or something. p  pIm spending 95 of my time looking for the solutions for problems that used to be unknown in other, sane, simpler environments long ago.p  pI feel that I could fix it all if I learned intricacies of Ivy, Gradle, Maven, and how they interact when used together, then moved on to debug Eclipse, write my own Maven archetypes, report tens of bugs to IDE makers and generally become a developer of the environment. Then, maybe, I could devote 20 of my time to write the actual application code. Am I doing something wrong, or is this mess the current state of things in the industry  Back in Borland Pascal days, thousands of files could compile in seconds on a i386. I want something at least remotely good.p  pstrongAll I want is to have the IDE set the project up for me. I just want to write my code and tests.strong I can spend 10 of time on googling environment issues, the rest needs to be devoted to business logic.

Negative 127 pWhats a good Python library for manipulating very large matrices e.g. millions of rowscolumns, including the ability to add rows or columns at any stage of the matrixs lifep  pI had looked at a hrefhttpwww.pytables.orgmoin relnofollowpytablesa and a hrefhttpwww.h5py.org relnofollowh5pya, but neither support adding or removing rows or columns once the matrix is created.p  pThe only other thing I could find was the sparse matrix functionality in numpyscipy noted in a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions2368544howcaniremoveacolumnfromasparsematrixefficientlythesea a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions4695337expandingaddingaroworcolumnascipysparsematrixquestionsa. However, the ability to addremove rows and columns seems possible but officially unsupported and a bit hacky, so Im fearing the performance would be horrible with a real dataset. Also, it includes several different sparse matrix implementations, so Im confused which one would be best e.g. lilmatrix vs cscmatrix vs csrmatrix.p

Negative 127 pPlease see the JSFiddle here which shows my issue a hrefhttpjsfiddle.netmlippyzkH7S relnofollowhttpjsfiddle.netmlippyzkH7Sap  pIm attempting to shuffle divs up and down a list with those divs moving up hiding the divs moving down. If you look at the fiddle, there are 5 different colored boxes that you can click to tell them to move to the top. If you click various boxes in various positions, youll start to see the zindex of the boxes moving up not be higher than that of the boxes moving down. If you click the 3rd positioned box repeatedly, thats been a quality reproducer for me. p  pThe angular directive myWidget is applying the indexes through classes which are being added  removed in chained addClass and removeClass calls. See below and the opposite version in the fiddle.p  precodeelement.removeClassmoveDown.addClassmoveUp.csstop, newValue  45  px  codepre  pI had thought that this meant the browser was going to complete the first chained call before moving onto the second and so on. However in this case it doesnt appear to be doing so.p  pAlso in the directive  below, youll find a working solution using timeout to delay the change to the css top value which triggers the transition. Its been commented out, but there are comments showing how to toggle to the solution in the two spots code needs to be changed. This feels like cheating  not the correct way for it to be done however. Hence the question here.p  precodeelement.removeClassmoveDown.addClassmoveUp timeoutfunction      element.csstop, newValue  45  px , 350 codepre  pThis is my first time using AngularJS, so feel free to let me know if Im using things incorrectly or theres a better pattern which would fix my issue.p  pThanksp

Negative 127 pI am using Nutiteq SDK which holds a MapView and am trying to use a navigation drawer as well. The problem I am having is that whenever I slide from the left or click the icon to open the drawer nothing opens, but I am unable to move the map until I slide the drawer back or click the icon again.

Negative 127 pIn a calendar app I display events based on the EventKit API. I fetch events from codeEKEventStorecode and display them in daily, weekly, monthly views, as lists, etc. Now I am running into some performance problems on iPhone 4. p  pThe performance problems are mainly speed related. It takes several seconds, for example, to collapse or expand all table view sections representing dates to show the rows representing events. It also takes 58 seconds to reload the table for the editing  export interface. I would have to check Instruments to give more details.p  pSo far there have been no memory issues.p  pMy strategy right now is to minimise the memory footprint. I am using arrays in memory, but they only contain the codeeventIdentifiercode, a short string. I can retrieve events with the codeEKEventStorecode method codeeventWithEventIdentifiercode. I suspect that this is the reason for the performance hit. p  pTwo alternatives come to mind p  ol lipUse codeEKEventcode objects instead of identifiers. However, I believe that this can be unpredictable regarding memory. Some events have lots of text so that the amount of data to be kept in memory is not limited. The duration of the period that has to show events could potentially also be very long. pli lipPort everything to Core Data, maybe with original codeEKEventcode objects stored as transformable objects. This would be a major refactoring, but I could take advantage of codeNSFetchedResultsControllercode and its optimisation features. pli ol  pI have tried 1 strongandstrong 2  performance is still badp  pWhat is your experience Have you seen performance issues with repeated calls to the codeEKEventStorecode database What would be your advicep  pstrongUPDATEstrongp  pInstruments report that indeed the tableViews codereloadDatacode takes quite long 1.5 secs. I am not sure why because the state of the table view collapsed sections or not and the entire data are loaded before and that code is efficient. p  pI am strongnotstrong calculating any cell heights sometimes this has been reported to force the entire table to load before display. The same lag appears when I callp  precode[tableView beginUpdates] [tableView endUpdates] codepre  pin order to animate the collapsing of the sections. p  pemNote maybe the topic of this question should be changed eliminating the EventKit part.emp

Negative 127 pI have a situation where Im needing to copy a bunch of records from one database to another, and the transfer involves a lot of transformation. I have run into a case where in addition to transformation, I need to validate and reject certain column values in the source data.

Anyway, these exorbitant weights arent allowed in the new database, so I have to identify and set those bad values aside.p  pWhat I want is to have a rule as a string expression that I can invoke during the transformation.

Negative 127 pIs it possible to have an element of an array tell its position in JavaScript If it is possible, it might come in handy when you have an array of objects and need to call on a method of one in the string of objects. You could pass its index as a method argument, but that seems messy and possibly unnecessary.p  pIdeally, it would be something like thisp  precodefunction ArrayType      this.showIdentity  function          alertthis.indexOf  This obviously doesnt work, but Im looking for                                  a method that will return the index of this                                   in its parent array.        var myArray  new Array  myArray[0]  new ArrayType myArray[1]  new ArrayType myArray[1].showIdentity  Should alert 1 codepre  pWould anyone know a sollution to this problem other than passing the index along with the methodp

Negative 127 pSorry if the question is too openended or otherwise not suitable, but this is due to my lack of understanding about several pieces of technologysoftware, and Im quite lost. I have a project where I have an existing java swing GUI, which runs MPI jobs on a local machine. However, it is desired to support running MPI jobs on HPC clusters lets assume linux cluster with ssh access. To be more specific, the main backend executable linux and windows that I need to, erm, execute uses a very simple masterslave system where all relevant output is performed by the master node only. Currently, to run my backend executable on multiple machines, I would simply need to copy all necessary files to the machines assuming no shared filespace and call mpiexec or mpirun as is usual practice. The output produced by the master needs to be read in or partially read in by my GUI.p  pThe main problem as I see things is this strongWhere to run the GUIstrong Several optionsp  ul liemLocal machineem  potential problem is needing to read data from cluster back to local machine and also reading stdoutstderr of the cluster processes to display current progress to user.li liemLogin nodeem  obvious problem of hogging precious resources, and in many cases will be banned. li liemCompute nodeem  sounds pretty dodgy  especially if the cluster has a queuing system slurm, sun grid, etc Also possibly banned.li ul  pOf these three options, the first seems the most reasonable, and also seems least likely to upset any HPC admin people, but is also the hardest to implement There are multiple problems associated with that setupp  ul liPassing data from cluster to local machine  because were using a cluster  by definition we probably will generate large amounts of data, which the user wants to see at least part of Also, how should this be done I can see how to execute commands on remote machine via ssh using jsch or similar, but if im currently logged in on the remote machine  how do I communicate information back to the local machineli liDisplaying stdoutstderr of backend in local machine.

Negative 127 pHow I can implement packed bubble graph in WinRT. I am trying to achieve  graph similar to attached image.img srchttpi.stack.imgur.comX1MVU.jpg altPacked Bubble Graph.p  pI tried for a similar implementation  sample for silverlight  Windows 8 in google, But didnt get any. Please anyone help me to achieve the same graph. My main issue is with implementing the logic correctly.p
Negative 127 pI have two elements, one is container, width 1245px, relative position and centered relatively to window with grey backgroundopacity 0.3 Second is absolute div greyleft, simple rectangle, which must be behind container, it must be positioned to the left of window, right point of element must be behind container.p  pTo simplify... width of rectangle where these two elements interact, must always be the same, regardless of window size And because container width is fixed, a greyleft must change width relatively to window width.p  pIs it possible with CSS, if not jQuery.p  pCodep  precodegreyleft     height 420px     top 84px     left 0px     position absolute     width     container      position relative     margin 0 auto     width 1245px    codepre  pThank you for your response.p
Negative 127 pIm trying to make a graph that includes both points and lines Ive been using a consistent set of colorfillshape combinations for the levels of my grouping factor Condition throughout a set of graphs that only have points, so I want to keep those the same in this graph as well.  However, I now also want to add some lines, and wish to manually specify the line colors.  So far so good the trouble is that Id really like the graph to have a single legend that shows the colorfillshape for the points as well as the color and line type of the lines.  Does anyone have any ideas about how to achieve this, perhaps with the new guide legend stuff which I have not yet wrapped my head around  Any suggestions would be much appreciated.  p  pAlso, if this helps explain why Im trying to do things this way, the data consist of samples that started out in Condition B, and were moved to Condition C Im trying to highlight what happens to dv when that change is made.  For reference, Im also showing data from samples maintained in Condition B or Condition C throughout the experiment, but I dont want those lines to be as prominent, since they arent the point of the graph.p  pHow can I get the line color in the legend to match the line color in the graphp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comR8W3i.png altenter image description herep  precodemydata lt structurelistCondition  structurec2L, 2L, 2L, 2L, 2L, 2L, 2L, 2L, 3L, 3L, 3L, 3L, 3L, 3L, 3L, 3L, 5L, 5L, 5L, 5L, 5L, 6L, 6L, 6L, 5L, 5L, 6L, .Label  cCondA, CondB, CondC, CondD, BeforeChange, AfterChange, class  factor, Day  c1, 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, 21, 1, 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, 21, 1, 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, 21, 13, 14, 14, dv  c7.18272766270665, 7.42730999263847, 7.66391016865676, 7.602389725654, 7.39221477975877, 7.46192935291398, 7.62075582981643, 7.47839284216667, 6.56987476062938, 6.69091456174267, 6.6697752192633, 6.35890571005243, 6.93927313468223, 6.65712651759238, 6.93055110758838, 7.0391827047215, 7.15066983259602, 7.59782467658902, 7.59892456901464, 7.42888298870538, 7.49983551294577, 7.30476290695126, 6.99896760719176, 6.97838387933162, 7.434811, 7.369787, 7.369787 , se  c0.152197789175902, 0.0396497303055128, 0.0506439629227802,  0.109997525500822, 0.114500535946067, 0.0736412492173867, 0.111473540926106,  0.0808019418670817, 0.133004775453176, 0.134977834863898, 0.167639712420762,  0.25651178518586, 0.0717077961089037, 0.164745732598605, 0.171383889660418,  0.133281180227772, 0.230898256311926, 0.178695661660643, 0.0427233153730758,  0.105571418251551, 0.10389399069655, 0.110566732681714, 0.152512756205137,  0.0759939810936424, 0.106119, 0.108343, 0.108343, .Names  cCondition, Day, dv, se, row.names  935, class  data.frame  requireggplot2 requirescales requiregrid  ggplot    themelegend.key.width  unit2.5, lines     scalefillmanualvalues  cCondB  white, CondC  black, BeforeChange  white, AfterChange  black, breaks  cCondB, CondC, BeforeChange, AfterChange     scalecolormanualvalues  cCondB  grey30, CondC  grey50, BeforeChange  grey30, AfterChange  grey50, breaks  cCondB, CondC, BeforeChange, AfterChange     scaleshapemanualvalues  cCondB  22, CondC  21, BeforeChange  22, AfterChange  21, breaks  cCondB, CondC, BeforeChange, AfterChange     scalelinetypemanualvalues  cCondB  dashed, CondC  longdash, BeforeChange  solid, AfterChange  solid, breaks  cCondB, CondC, BeforeChange, AfterChange      geomlinedata  mydata[mydataCondition in cCondB, ], aesxas.numericas.characterDay, ydv, groupCondition, linetype  Condition, color  grey60     geomlinedata  mydata[mydataCondition in cCondC, ], aesxas.numericas.characterDay, ydv, groupCondition, linetype  Condition, color  grey50     geomlinedata  mydata[mydataCondition in cBeforeChange, ], aesxas.numericas.characterDay, ydv, linetype  Condition, color  grey30     geomlinedata  mydata[mydataCondition in cAfterChange, ], aesxas.numericas.characterDay, ydv, linetype  Condition, color  black      geompointdata  mydata[mydataCondition in cCondB, CondC, BeforeChange, AfterChange amp mydataDay in c1, 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, 21, ], aesxas.numericas.characterDay, ydv, color  Condition, fill  Condition, shape  Condition, size3      scaleycontinuousbreaks  58, labels  mathformat10.x     geomsegmentaesx14, y7.77, xend14, yend7.41, arrowarrowlengthunit0.3, cm, type  closed, angle  20, size0.7  codepre

Negative 127 pSo I have the following questionspre 1. What does SETCURRENTKEY actually do 2. What is the benefit of SETCURRENTKEY 3. Why would I use SETCURRENTKEY 4. When would I use SETCURRENTKEY 5. What is the advantage of using an index and how do I tie this analogously to  the example of an old sorting system of a library 6. What type of database querying efficiency problems does this function solveprep  pI have been searching all over the internet and the IT Pro Developer Help internal Navision documentation for this poorly documented function and I cannot find a right answer to my questions.p  pThe only thing I know is that SETCURRENTKEY sets the current key for a record variable and it sorts the recordset based on it. When SETCURRENTKEY is used with only a few keys, it can improve query performance. I have no idea what is actually happening when a database uses an index versus not using an index.p  pSomeone told me this is how SETCURRENTKEY works emIt is like the old sorting card system in a library without SETCURRENTKEY you would have to go through each shelf and manually filter out for the book you want. You would find a mix of random books and you would have to say No, not this one. Yes, this one. With SETCURRENTKEY you can have an index analogous to the old system where you would just go to a book or music CD based on its Author or Artist etc.emp  pThats all fine, but I still cant properly answer my questions. p

Negative 127 pI lost the keystore for an android app so I have to use a different bundle identifier e.g. was com.domain and try com.domain.www or com.domain.appname When I use Rename Application Package to change it to something else and Run the app on a phone the internet connection to the app stops working. If I rename it back to the original the internet connection for the app works again.

Negative 127 pIm using emPaperInputem and like the feel. But, is there a way to do the validation using my own logic For instance, in some cases a pattern match is not enough to determine the error Id like to display. An example would be I want the emPaperInputem to specify an item which can only be added once, so the validation would do a lookup in some model map and if eminput.inputValueem is not present it is valid, otherwise invalid.p    pre classlangdart prettyprintoverridecode  ltpaperinput floatingLabel                idaliasinput                validatealiasIsValid                typetext                erroraliasError                labelPerson Alias eg King, Eldest Son, Mooch, etc.                required                gtltpaperinputgt codepre  pSo, I would like to be able to implement embool aliasIsValidem and set emobservable String aliasErrorem when validation is invalid.

Im trying to figure out how to abort my build when I get an error in the generatetestresources phase.p  pstrongRequirementstrong During mavens generatetestresources phase, I have processes that run on a remote server iSeries. From those calls, I retrieve a success flag true or false.

Negative 127 pIm trying to create a program that receives messages from various applications through a common queue as it stands, a POSIX message queue and dispatches these commands to a pool of worker threads.p  pIve changed designs more than I can remember over the last days, so rather than badly reinventing the wheel, I thought Id come here for advice, specifically regarding how to terminate the program.p  pId like the termination event to be received through the queue, and acknowledged by a worker so that the dispatcher does not bother preprocessing the command, which may imply authenticationchecking to be done by a worker.p  pThus I need a way for the information to somehow come back from a worker up to the dispatcher, to tell the latter to stop.p  pIn my current iteration, the main thread is the dispatcher thread, receiving from the queue and exchanging signals through conditional variables with workers to inform idle threads of pending commands. The way I see it, signals will have to enter the picturep  ul liif the queue is nonblocking, the dispatcher will call in order codemqnotifycode, codemqreceivecode and codesigwaitcode after receiving codeEAGAINcode li liif the queue is blocking, the dispatcher will simply call codemqreceivecode, which will return with codeEINTRcode when interrupted by a signal.li ul  pIn both cases the dispatcher will be running codewhileatomicloadstate  POOLTERMINATINGcode, which will be set by the worker that authenticates the terminating command and raises a signal.p  pNow for the questionsp  ol liIs there anything I need worry about when using signals and threads, beside that its not a trivial exercise li liIs there any reason I should bother with a nonblocking queue for the dispatcher, since its only job is to forward messages  ul liIf there is, can someone cure me from my paranoid fear that a new message notification is going to arrive between codeif ret  EAGAINcode and codesigwaitcodeli ulli liIf I go for the blocking queue, can I do without a handler I.e. the worker sets codePOOLTERMINATINGcode, sends the signal, and codemqreceivecode simply returns with codeEINTRcode if the dispatcher was receiving I dont know enough about signals yet to see a way to tell the system interrupt a call such as codemqreceivecode, but dont bother with handlers, so I guess it will be an empty handler.li liAm I DoingItWrongli ol  pThanks in advance.p

Negative 127 pIm currently developing a program to compare two pieces of text based on its semantics meaning. I understand there are libraries such as lingpipe which provide useful methods to compare string distances, however ive heard that LSA is the best method to measure text similarity.p  pI just have one confusion with using LSA to measure text similarity. I understand that the process is, with LSA, p  precode1.Two passages are represented as two matrices X and Y.   2.Using SVD, the matrices each are reduced to 3 different matrices   3.And then the cosine distance is measured between the two matrices  4. The cosine distance determines how similar they are codepre  pI just want to know...p  pA. in SVD the matrix is reduced to 3 smaller matrix. So which of these smaller matrix is used in the cosine distance measurementp  pB. Cosine distance is usually applied to vectors. So in the case of applying them to matrices, i assumed the matrix is iterated through and cosine distance is measured between every 2 vectors. And then the average of all these distances is assumed to be the final cosine distance between these two matricesp  pI understand this is a very niche topic, but im hoping for some light on this 2 questions.

When I start the app with debugger attached, I see what I expect codeapplicationDidFinishLaunchingcode is called first, then codeapplicationDidBecomeActivecodep  pWhen I run the app without the debugger, I get the calls in the order reversed codeapplicationDidBecomeActivecode is called before codeapplicationDidFinishLaunchingcodep  pIs there a reason for this It makes it very confusing to account for different scenarios based on debugger vs. nondebugger. p  p[note testing this is in Mavericks]p

I want the image to always fill its container while maintaining its aspect ratio.p  pIf I implement this as a background image, its simple enough to add codebackgroundsize covercodep  precode.cover    width 100   height 500px   backgroundimage urlmyimage.jpg   backgroundsize cover   backgroundposition center  codepre  pa hrefhttpjsfiddle.neth7542mys relnofollowhttpjsfiddle.neth7542mysap  pIf you try resizing the browser window, youll see that the image covers the entire area by essentially scaling the image up.p  pThe issue is that I want to change the image source depending on the resolution, so that I dont have to serve gigantic assets to mobile devices. If I knew the image URLs at build time, I could use media queries for that, however, these are dynamic images that I only know the URLs for at runtime.p  pAt runtime, I can generate image URLs for cropped and resized images, so ideally Id want to do something likep  precodeltdiv classcovergt   ltimg srcgetImageUrlimage.jpg, 320, 500 srcsetgetImageUrlimage.jpg, 320, 500 320w, getImageUrlimage.jpg, 640, 500 640w, getImageUrlimage.jpg, 1000, 500 1000w sizes100vwgt ltdivgt codepre  pAnd then somehow get the image to fill the container just like the background image would. But if I give the image a codeheightcode and codewidthcode of code100code, its obviously just going to stretch. Giving the image a codeminwidth 100code will set it to be as wide as its parent, but the height will be smaller.p  pThe only way Ive been able to get it to work is using codeobjectfit covercode, but that has pretty bad browser support, and the polyfills Ive found havent worked with codesrcsetcode a hrefhttpjsfiddle.netLctosbru relnofollowhttpjsfiddle.netLctosbruap  pEssentially, Id like to get the same effect as codebackgroundsize covercode or codeobjectfit covercode. Is there a way to do thisp

Negative 127 pI am using the JMS broker of a JBoss 5.1 instance in my Spring application. The application consists of several producers and consumers that write to different queues. The application should handle disconnects from the MessageBroker by simply retrying to send or to consume messages synchronously.

On the producer side I use the codeconvertAndSendcode method of a codeJmsTemplatecode like sop  precodeBean public JmsTemplate createTemplateCachingConnectionFactory connectionFactory, MarshallingMessageConverter message      JmsTemplate template  new JmsTemplateconnectionFactory     template.setMessageConvertermessage     template.setExplicitQosEnabledtrue     return template  codepre  pThe ConnectionFactory gets injected like sop  precodeltbean idconnectionFactory     classorg.springframework.jms.connection.CachingConnectionFactorygt     ltconstructorarggt         ltbean classorg.jboss.jms.client.JBossConnectionFactorygt             ltconstructorarggt                 ltref beanconnectionFactoryDelegate gt             ltconstructorarggt         ltbeangt     ltconstructorarggt     ltproperty namesessionCacheSize value1 gt     ltproperty namereconnectOnException valuetrue gt ltbeangt codepre  pAnd the JBoss delegate looks like thisp  precodeltbean idconnectionFactoryDelegate     classorg.jboss.jms.client.delegate.ClientConnectionFactoryDelegategt     ltconstructorarg typejava.lang.String         valuejboss.messaging.connectionfactoryserviceConnectionFactory gt     ltconstructorarg typejava.lang.String         valuejboss.messaging.connectionfactoryserviceConnectionFactory gt     ltconstructorarg typeint value0 gt     ltconstructorarg typejava.lang.String valuejms.serviceLocatorUrl gt     ltconstructorarg typeorg.jboss.messaging.util.Version         refjbossMessagingVersion gt     ltconstructorarg typeboolean valuetrue gt     ltconstructorarg typeboolean valuefalse gt     ltconstructorarg typeboolean valuefalse gt ltbeangt codepre  pSo far, I have managed to set a number of retries by increasing the codenumberOfCallRetriescode parameter in the serviceLocatorUrl of the JBoss delegate, but this does not solve my problem 1.

Negative 127 pBelow is the code I am having issue with. Everything worked great until I added the line for Asian. The information for this had to come from a new table so I had to do a new join. Once I did this I started having problems with the information. The problem is that CDSMailPlayer can have multiple MailID for the same person. It would then do all the Sums for each MailID and then add them all together. So if a player was showing 100 Actual but had 2 mail id their Actual would come out as 200. If they had 10 mail ids then their actual would skyrocket to 1000. p  pHow can I add in a check to see if someone has a Mail ID between the range of 161 and 166 while not messing up my mathp  pAlso on a side note is there a way to change the Where clause to pull a rolling 12 months such that if you pulled the report anyday in December of 2014 it would pull 121201311302014 but if you pulled the report in Jan of 2015 the date range would change to 11201412312014.

I have added the Custom Action and added the Custom UI screen that I wish the delay to run on, however I am not sure how to link the UI to the Custom Action, will this need to be done through Orcap  pBasically I want the delay to run until a driver is installed by windows, which usually requires about 10 seconds so eventually I would be looking at putting a countdown button into the install but for now getting the UI to delay the end user by 10 seconds will suffice.p  pAny help is much appreciatedp

Negative 127 pIs there a way to use Mapbox GL asking about both JS and native in an offline setting With MBTiles, you could use either the MBTiles file or extract the raster images. Im wondering if theres anything similar that would allow Mapbox GL to load the data from a local source as opposed to requiring a web connection to Mapboxs servers. Not talking about just caching data for when the user is offline but actually making a map that runs purely offline all the time. Thanks.p

Negative 127 pThis is probably my second question in stackoverflow, so apologies for any mistakes.p  pI am learning core java right now. Recently i went through a tutorial series by a hrefhttpthenewboston.com relnofollowthenewbostona where he teaches us how to make a simple Instant messenger using Java. But, the problem is that, I cant install the IM in another PC and start chatting by specifying the IP addresses of the computers. I need to have a dedicated server and the client can only communicate with the server.p  pI was wondering how IM like WhatsApp work, where one client is connected to another client. Is it possible to make a client to client connection without involving any serverp

Negative 127 pIm creating a consolebased Evil Hangman program. Instead of selecting a word at the beginning of the game, a list of words is progressively narrowed down by selecting out words that contain letters that the user inputs.p  pThis is a pretty common assignment, so Im sure that youve heard of something similar before. p  pHere is the specification, in case if you need more clarification.p  pa hrefhttpcourses.cs.washington.educoursescse14315wihomework5spec.pdf relnofollowSpecificationap  pNecessary file and client for compilationp  pa hrefhttpcourses.cs.washington.educoursescse14315wihomework5dictionary.txt relnofollowFileap  pa hrefhttpcourses.cs.washington.educoursescse14315wihomework5HangmanMain.java relnofollowHangmanMainap  pThe problematic method in this particular class is the record method, which is by far the most difficult method to program in this assignment. There are two main problems that Im observingp  pa There is the following NullPointerException that I cant figure out the reason for. Its occurring at a line where a word is being added to the list. As far as I can tell, the word and the list should both exist and are both initialized. Its not a matter of the list not containing a word or of the list not being properly initialized. It seems to only happen after the second user input.p  precodeException in thread main java.lang.NullPointerException at HangmanManager.recordHangmanManager.java66 at HangmanMain.playGameHangmanMain.java59 at HangmanMain.mainHangmanMain.java39 codepre  pb The NullPointerException is probably caused at my earlier attempts to fix another problem. Before the NullPointerException occurred, I was experiencing problems determining why the word selected by the program wasnt following the expected output. No matter what I did, the word selected by the program at the end of the traversal would always be aa. Even when I had deliberately chose a as a guess, which should have effectively filtered out aa as a choice, it still showed up.p  pHere is my program so far.p  precodeimport java.util. public class HangmanManager  private String pattern private int length private int max private SortedSetltCharactergt guessesMade private SetltStringgt words private SetltStringgt currentWords private MapltString, SetltStringgtgt patternMap  public HangmanManagerListltStringgt dictionary, int length, int max     if length lt 1  max lt 0         throw new IllegalArgumentException          this.length  length     this.max  max     words  new TreeSetltStringgt     for String word  dictionary         if word.length  length             words.addword                   currentWords  new TreeSetltStringgt     guessesMade  new TreeSetltCharactergt     patternMap  new TreeMapltString, SetltStringgtgt     pattern       for int i  0 i lt length i         pattern           public SetltStringgt words     return words  public int guessesLeft     return max  guessesMade.size  public SortedSetltCharactergt guesses     return guessesMade  public String pattern     if words.isEmpty         throw new IllegalArgumentExceptionThere are no words.          return pattern   public int recordchar guess     if guessesLeft lt 1  words.isEmpty         throw new IllegalStateException            if words.isEmpty ampamp guessesMade.containsguess           throw new IllegalArgumentException          guessesMade.addguess     int largestOccurences  0     for String word words         System.out.printlnword         System.out.printlnwords.size         if patternMap.containsKeypattern                System.out.printlnpatternMap contains pattern             largestOccurences  generatePatternword, guess             currentWords.addword             currentWords  patternMap.getpattern             patternMap.putpattern, currentWords                    else              currentWords.addword             patternMap.putpattern, currentWords                   words  findFamily     return largestOccurences  private SetltStringgt findFamily     int maxSize  0     Map ltString, Integergt patternCount  new TreeMapltString, Integergt     for String key  patternMap.keySet         patternCount.putkey, patternMap.getkey.size             if patternMap.getkey.size gt maxSize                 maxSize  patternMap.getkey.size                 pattern  key              else if patternMap.getkey.size  maxSize                 if key.length gt pattern.length                     pattern  key                     maxSize  patternMap.getkey.size                                            System.out.printlnCurrent pattern   pattern     return patternMap.getpattern   private int generatePatternString s, char guess      int count  0     pattern           for int i  0 i lt length i             if s.charAti  guess                 pattern  guess                    count              else                  pattern                              return count   codepre

Negative 127 pI am new to sphinx4 and speech recognition thing. I am creating a speech application by using sphinx4. The issue is noise, which results in recognition by program even without speech input by user ie it is converting speech to text even when there is no speech input by user, thus affecting accuracy.p  pMain issue is how to implement noise reduction. This is because the system detects input even when I dont speak anything into the microphone. So I guess its because of noise. p  pI checked online for noise reduction but there is hardly clear information about the same. Though there is some information over internet about file named Denoise.java which comes with sphinx4. But it is not there in sphinx41.06. p  pAnother file is WienerFilter.java, wienerfilter is type of filter used for noisy signals. But no instructions for using or implementing that file.p  pI have already added few more words to hello.gram which is the grammar file for the program. The phonetic representation of those extra words, generated by Imtool, has been added to the dictionary.p  pI am using eclipse and sphinx41.0beta6p  pThough there is one question on stack overflow on HOW TO ACITIVATE NOISE CANCELLATION  IN SPHINX4 but that has not been answered yetp

Negative 127 pI have a jenkins instance that does a release build using xcodebuild. I then have a script on Jenkins to create the .ipa file using xcrun. this worked fine for us until now. Now we have a watchkit app and the .ipa file that is created from this process is not the same as the one that is created if you do an archive build and export it from Xcode.p  pThe exported .ipa from Xcode has a Payload folder, a Symbols folder probably optional and a WatchKitSupport folder. The ipa generated from the xcrun doesnt have the Symbols or the WatchKitSupport folder. See more about the structure here  a hrefhttpstackoverflow.coma29400301327386httpstackoverflow.coma29400301327386ap  pI saw this post on SO  a hrefhttpstackoverflow.coma19856005327386httpstackoverflow.coma19856005327386a that has commands to archive and export the .ipa build similar to the Xcode process but even that didnt create the new folders in question.p  pDoes anyone know if there is a way to use the command line tools to create an .ipa file that is equivalent to the one created by Xcode I didnt find any official documentation on thisp

Negative 127 pBit of a strange one but probably a straight forward answer. Basically I am using an AJAX script to retrieve results from a PHP file and have these printed in a div with pagination applied. What I am trying to achieve is that the page search.php fires a value a year to the getYear.php file, this sets up the pagination process and sends the year to the pagination parser file which inturn returns the results. Essentially I have a script which sends the year, then a script which again sends the year and the pagination details and a script which applies the pagination. I have this working manually when I set the year in the URL, the results print however they do not print in the main page.p  pHere is the script on the search.php filep  precodeltscriptgt     function showYearyear          if year                document.getElementByIdtxtHint.innerHTML               return          else               if window.XMLHttpRequest                   code for IE7, Firefox, Chrome, Opera, Safari                 xmlhttp  new XMLHttpRequest              else                   code for IE6, IE5                 xmlhttp  new ActiveXObjectMicrosoft.XMLHTTP                          xmlhttp.onreadystatechange  function                  if xmlhttp.readyState  4 ampamp xmlhttp.status  200                      document.getElementByIdtxtHint.innerHTML  xmlhttp.responseText                                           xmlhttp.openGET,getYear.phpyearyear,true             xmlhttp.send                   ltscriptgt  codepre  pthis does send the year value and expects the results back in the txthint div, it sends it to getYear.phpp  precodeltphp ifissetGET[year] echo No year given headerLocation search.php  year  intvalGET[year]  con  mysqliconnectlocalhost,XXXX,XXXX,XXXX if con      dieCould not connect  . mysqlierrorcon   sql  SELECT COUNTtaskid FROM tasks WHERE Yeardate  year query  mysqliquerycon, sql row  mysqlifetchrowquery   Here we have the total row count totalrows  row[0]  Specify how many results per page rpp  10  This tells us the page number of our last page last  ceiltotalrowsrpp  This makes sure last cannot be less than 1 iflast lt 1     last  1   Close the database connection mysqliclosecon  gt ltscriptgt var rpp  ltphp echo rpp gt  results per page var last  ltphp echo last gt  last page number var year  ltphp echo year gt  last page number function requestpagepn     var resultsbox  document.getElementByIdresultsbox     var paginationcontrols  document.getElementByIdpaginationcontrols     resultsbox.innerHTML  loading results ...     var hr  new XMLHttpRequest     hr.openPOST, paginationparser.php, true     hr.setRequestHeaderContenttype, applicationxwwwformurlencoded     hr.onreadystatechange  function          ifhr.readyState  4 ampamp hr.status  200              var dataArray  hr.responseText.split             var htmloutput               fori  0 i lt dataArray.length  1 i                 var itemArray  dataArray[i].split                 htmloutput  lttrgtlttdgtitemArray[0]lttdgt lttdgtitemArray[1]lttdgt lttdgtitemArray[2]lttdgt lttdgtitemArray[3]lttdgt lttdgtitemArray[4]lttdgtlttrgtlthrgt                          resultsbox.innerHTML  htmloutput                   hr.sendrpprppamplastlastampyearyearamppnpn      Change the pagination controls     var paginationCtrls        Only if there is more than 1 page worth of results give the user pagination controls     iflast  1         if pn gt 1              paginationCtrls  ltbutton onclickrequestpagepn1gtampltltbuttongt                  paginationCtrls   ampnbsp ampnbsp ltbgtPage pn of lastltbgt ampnbsp ampnbsp          if pn  last              paginationCtrls  ltbutton onclickrequestpagepn1gtampgtltbuttongt                   paginationcontrols.innerHTML  paginationCtrls  ltscriptgt ltheadgt ltdiv classcontainerfluidgt lt Table Headers gt lttable classtable tablehover tableresponsivegt     lttheadgt         lttrgt             ltthgtltthgtltthgtTitleltthgtltthgtDateltthgtltthgtTypeltthgtltthgtHouse LocationltthgtltthgtHousematesltthgt             ltbrgt         lttrgt     lttheadgt        lttbodygt ltdiv idpaginationcontrolsgtltdivgt  ltdiv idresultsboxgtltdivgt  lttbodygt ltdivgt lttablegt  ltscriptgt requestpage1 ltscriptgt codepre  pHere is the pagination parser which does workp  precodeltphp  Make the script run only if there is a page number posted to this script ifissetPOST[pn]      rpp  pregreplace[09], , POST[rpp]     last  pregreplace[09], , POST[last]     year  POST[year]     pn  pregreplace[09], , POST[pn]       This makes sure the page number isnt below 1, or more than our last page     if pn lt 1           pn  1       else if pn gt last           pn  last            Connect to our database here     con  mysqliconnectlocalhost,XXX,XXX,XXXX     if con      dieCould not connect  . mysqlierrorcon           This sets the range of rows to query for the chosen pn     limit  LIMIT  .pn  1  rpp ., .rpp      This is your query again, it is for grabbing just one page worth of rows by applying limit     sql  SELECT  FROM tasks WHERE Yeardateyear ORDER BY taskid DESC limit     query  mysqliquerycon, sql     dataString       whilerow  mysqlifetcharrayquery, MYSQLIASSOC         title  row[title]         dateProduced  strftimeb d, Y, strtotimerow[date]         type  row[type]         houseLocation  row[houseLocation]         housemates  row[housemates]         dataString . title..dateProduced..type..houseLocation..housemates.

Negative 127 pI am proposing an idea for a final year project that is basically a virtual environment.

So basically a user comes along, goes to my website, registers their details. a csv file is then produced based on the details that are input.

The powershell script itself is simple its just how I would get it to run is another thing. p

Negative 127 pIm using Python 3 recently switched from Python 2. My code usually runs on Linux but also sometimes not often on Windows. According to Python 3 documentation for a hrefhttpsdocs.python.org3libraryfunctions.htmlopen relnofollowcodeopencodea, the default encoding for a text file is from codelocale.getpreferredencodingcode if the codeencodingcode arg is not supplied. I want this default value to be codeutf8code for a project of mine, no matter what OS its running on currently, its always UTF8 for Linux, but not for Windows. The project has many many calls to codeopencode and I dont want to add codeencodingutf8code to all of them.

Negative 127 pIm beginning to develop for a Renesas RZA1L microcontroller. Renesas provide an IDE e2 Studio  a modified version of Eclipse, set up to compile C  C with GCC. Everything works fine, but...p  pIf I declare an object in filescope outside of any function, its constructor is never called. For instancep  precodeclass NewClass  public     int i     NewClass          i  4         NewClass newInstance  int mainvoid       My program...  codepre  pI can tell that the constructor isnt being called because, using the incircuit debugging setup supplied by Renesas, I can see that i is never set to 4 even when I place further references to newInstance and i I have optimisation switched off too. Sorry I cant do a simple cout of is value  the code is being run in a microcontroller and I havent worked out how to do that just yet.p  pIf I instead place the codeNewClass newInstancecode line inside of main, then the problem goes away.p  pA further consequence of the problem is that, for inheriting classes, calling a virtual function on one via a pointer of baseclass type causes a crash  I suspect due to the constructor having not executed and hence not written to memory some indicator of what class the object was.p  pBy what mechanism would such a constructor normally be called I did some Googling  would it be the .ctors list a hrefhttpsgcc.gnu.orgonlinedocsgccintInitialization.html relnofollowhttpsgcc.gnu.orgonlinedocsgccintInitialization.htmlap  pRenesass template C project does actually include code to call all of the ctors however, from looking at my generated .map file for the project, I can see that no ctors are actually present. Does that narrow down the problem  is the GCC compiler not spitting them out when it should bep  pMany thanks for your help.p

Negative 127 pI am building a GUI application to monitorcontrol remote embedded client devices.  Each clients state machine is maintained in a master dictionary and is to be represented in the GUI as an instance of a tab Frame in a Notebook widget.  I want to instantiate a tab defined as a class in my application whenever a new client registers and hide or forget the tab when the client link times out.  Ill reinstantiate ifwhen the client reregisters.p  pIm new to Python, Tkinter and OO in general and am struggling with program structure.  I need to continuously loop through the dictionary records to refresh the GUI, but Ive concluded I cant iterate within the root.mainloop structure.  So external changes in state machine dictionary records or elements need to refresh corresponding GUI Notebook tab instances externally, including creating and removing instances of my tab class.p  pIm confident there is a standard practice but I havent progressed sufficiently in my learning to figure this out.  Some quick suggestions to nudge me in the right direction would be appreciated.p
