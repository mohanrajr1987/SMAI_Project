Positive 4520 pIm lamenting the lack of documentation for the Wix Burn bootstrapper engine. Im hoping I can get a few specific questions answered.p  pI know that the Burn engine requires .Net 4.0. It seems to have its own minibootstrapper that will install .Net 4.0 if its not present.p  p1  .Net 4.5 is supposed to be an inplace replacement for .Net 4.0. Does the minibootstrapper recognize this and not install 4.0 if it sees 4.5 is presentp  p2 My application and my custom bootstrapper require .Net 4.5. Can I tell the minibootstrapper to install 4.5 instead of 4.0p  pThis leads directly to questions about BootstrapperCore.config. p  p3 How does the startup, supportedRuntime element tie into this p  p4 Where can I find the list of allowed values and the syntax for the version and sku attributesp  p5 If I want only 4.5, should I still include a supportedRuntime for 4.0p  p6 How does the host, supportedFramework element tie into thisp  p7 If my custom bootstrapper requires 4.5, will it fail if I include a supportedFramework for 4.0, and 4.0 is present but 4.5 is notp  p8 If I require 4.5 and the target system already has 4.5.1 or later, will Burn recognize this and skip installing 4.5p  pAlso, possibly nonrelated, whats the difference between v4Full and v4Clientp

Positive 4520 pI have a WIX file .wxs in which we are using USERDOMAIN environment variable to retrieve the domain of the logged in user. For eg., it gives DOMAINA for a user logged in as DOMAINAuser1. This extracted domain name is then used to prefix other Security Groups that are used to ACL web resources.p  pIt was working fine until now. But now, due to security restrictions, the logged in user is not from the same domain the server and applications run. The user is logged in from a Management domain, say DOMAINM. Now, USERDOMAIN does not help as the resources are ACLed with incorrect SGs, like DOMAINMSG1, etc, which dont exist.p  pWhat are my options to retrieve the domain of the server so that it can be used in the WIX file for generating MSI for deploymentp  pThanks for your helpp

Positive 4520 pI have built an MSI Installer using WIX. And I want to disable cancel button only when user is performing uninstall from Control panel or performing uninstall in basic mode qb. p  pNote  In full mode qf installer is disabling Cancel button.

Positive 4520 pMy WiX installer Wix 3.10, MSI 4.5 uses codeMajorUpgradecode for updating. The files to be installed are harvested with codeheat.execode in prebuild. The current older msi file contains a file codenlog.dllcode which came with a NuGet package codev4.1.0code that has a file version of code4.1.0.0code, a product version of code4.1.0code and last write time of code20150901code.p  pSince the nlog team ran into some strong naming issues, they published an updated NuGet package codev4.1.1code, containing an updated codenlog.dllcode strongwith its file version decreased back to code4.0.0.0codestrong while its product version has been increased to code4.1.1code, last write time is code20150914code.p  pNow Im running into a related issue as Robbie did here a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions15138731wixmajorupgradenotinstallingallfileswix major upgrade not installing all filesa When I install the new msi package and the major upgrade is performed, the present codenlog.dllcode which is newer according to its file version, but older according to its file date and product version is being removed, but the new codenlog.dllcode isnt installed.p  pHowever, using codeScheduleafterInstallExecutecode or codeScheduleafterInstallFinalizecode as suggested wont do the trick for me. Instead of removing the newer file and not installing the older one as in Robbies case, it doesnt overwrite the present file, and just leaves it in place.p  pLong story short, I would like my installer to simply install all files that come with it, regardless of any fileproductassembly versioning stuff. There are valid circumstances in which replacing a newer file with an older one is desired. Cant you just tell the installer engine to ignore file versionsdates If not, what are my optionsp

Positive 4520 pCurrently we are using wix to create installer for our project. Weve already implemented  for the project  we specified  since were automating the build process and dont want developers to have to change it manually every time p  pHowever, were binding the SVN revision to the 4th number in version  like this  [ 1.0.0.SVNRevision ] so every SVN build create a minor upgrade that cause various problem to our installationp  pSo, do we have a way to manage those minor upgrade without messing with the already implemented major upgrade some way to just disable the installation if it is a minor upgrade would be simple and nice Thanksp
Positive 4520 pWe have been working on rebuilding our installer with WIX and Burn, using a custom bootstrapper application.  We are using a feature tree in our main MSI, and have set EnableFeatureSelectionyes so that we can replicate the feature tree in our custom BA UI and send those feature selections down to the MSI at planapply time.  This has all been working well until we started recently to test the upgrade process.  We have run into what appears to be an open bug in Burnp  pa hrefhttpwixtoolset.orgissues4616 relnofollowhttpwixtoolset.orgissues4616ap  pWhen we do a minor upgrade, the features that are already installed do not get upgraded...the originally installed code remains on the machine.  From the testing and investigation weve done, we believe its because Burn isnt passing REINSTALLALL to the MSI package which is what the above bug says.p  pWe found this question where Rob says you have to handle the OnPlanMsiFeature callback, which we are doing correctly.p  pa hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions15394382wixpassoptiontomsiforrepairwix pass option to msi for repairap  pSince the above bug has been open since Dec 2014, we didnt have confidence that it would be fixed soon, so we decided that we would try to find a workaround.  What weve come up with so far is hackish at best, but at a proof of concept level, it shows some promise.  We are copying the entire MsiPackage node, giving the copy a new ID and adding a property with REINSTALLALL on it, like thisp  precode  ltMsiPackage  IdMSI     Cacheyes     Compressedno     DisplayInternalUIno     Vitalyes     Visibleyes     EnableFeatureSelectionyes     SourceFileltpath to MSIgtgt   ltMsiPackagegt     ltMsiPackage  IdMSIREINSTALL     Cacheyes     Compressedno     DisplayInternalUIno     Vitalyes     Visibleyes     EnableFeatureSelectionyes     SourceFileltpath to MSIgtgt      ltMsiProperty NameREINSTALL ValueALLgt   ltMsiPackagegt codepre  pThen, in our custom BA, we are using the DetectRelatedMsiPackage event to detect a minor upgrade.  And using that minor upgrade detection to set the RequestState for each MsiPackage to either Local or None inside our PlanPackageBegin event handler, like thisp  precode            if e.PackageId  MSI                              if Operation  RelatedOperation.MinorUpdate                                      e.State  RequestState.None                                  else                                      e.State  RequestState.Present                                            if e.PackageId  MSIREINSTALL                              if Operation  RelatedOperation.MinorUpdate                                      e.State  RequestState.Present                                  else                                      e.State  RequestState.None                               codepre  pWere hoping to have some guidance from others who have run into this error with upgrades in Burn with EnableFeatureSelection turned on.  Will our workaround do the job  Alternatively, is there a way to dynamically create an MsiProperty from the custom BA so we can create REINSTALLALL as needed  Does anyone have other ideas of how to workaround this issue that are cleaner andor more reliable  p  pIf you need more information, let me know.  Weve been working with WixBurn for a couple months now, so we know some things...but were not experts yet.  p

Positive 4520 pI am new to both Wix and WixSharp. I recently learnt Wix and created a basic installer with it. One of the properties I used was IniFileSearch which helped me search a value from an IniFile and use that to find an install location for my files. I am trying to do the same using WixSharp but dont seem to find an equivalent method. The closest thing I could find in WixSharp is the AppSearch class under WixSharp.CommonTasks.  From Wix I know that AppSearch is a MSI database table where search tasks are stored. IniFileSearch is one of those searches. I am not even sure if the AppSearch class in WixSharp library is directly mapped to the AppSearch MSI database table.

Positive 4520 pI am working on a problem in WIX where the outcome of a custom action needs to dictate whether the next custom action will run.

Positive 4520 pI have been working on a project where I need to install a Java service running as a spring boot application from a Wix installer for Windows.

Positive 4520 pI am in the process of learning how to develop a custom managed bootstrapper for wixburn. Up to my knowlege there are no official tutorials, unofficial tutorials are always filled with WPF stuff which Im not interested in and most people on forums do not do much more than saying that you must create a class that inherits from BootstrapperApplication and overrides the Run method. p  pI did that, created the config file, added the payloads to the xml markup. The resulting installer did nothing, actually it ran forever, only killing it stopped it. I sincerely expected that calling base.Run would give me some basic default GUIless behavior. But that is only an abstract method. Eventually I learned that I must call some Engine.functions to actually do some work. So I wrote this to testp  precodeprotected override void Run      Engine.Detect     Engine.PlanLaunchAction.Install     Engine.ApplyIntPtr.Zero     Engine.Quit0  codepre  pI successfully compiled a package that actually installed, the problem is that it can not be uninstalled.

Negative 4520 pI need a very fast algorithm for the following task. I have already implemented several algorithms that complete it, but theyre all too slow for the performance I need. It should be fast enough that the algorithm can be run at least 100,000 times a second on a modern CPU. It will be implemented in C.p  pI am working with spansranges, a structure that has a start and an end coordinate on a line.p  pI have two vectors dynamic arrays of spans and I need to merge them. One vector is src and the other dst. The vectors are sorted by span start coordinates, and the spans do not overlap within one vector.p  pThe spans in the src vector must be merged with the spans in the dst vector, such that the resulting vector is still sorted and has no overlaps. Ie. if overlaps are detected during the merging, the two spans are merged into one. Merging two spans is just a matter of changing the coordinates in the structure.p  pNow, there is one more catch, the spans in the src vector must be widened during the merge. This means that a constant will be added to the start and another larger constant to the end coordinate of every span in src. This means that after the src spans are widened they might overlap.p  phr p  pWhat I have arrived at so far is that it cannot be done fully inplace, some kind of temporary storage is needed. I think it should be doable in linear time over the number of elements of src and dst summed.p  pAny temporary storage can probably be shared between multiple runs of the algorithm.p  pThe two primary approaches I have tried, which are too slow, arep  ol lipAppend all elements of src to dst, widening each element before appending it. Then run an inplace sort. Finally iterate over the resulting vector using a read and write pointer, with the read pointer running ahead of the write pointer, merging spans as they go. When all elements have been merged the read pointer reaches end dst is truncated.pli lipCreate a temporary workvector. Do a naive merge as described above by repeatedly picking the next element from either src or dst and merging into the workvector. When done, copy the workvector to dst, replacing it.pli ol  pThe first method has the problem that sorting is Omnlogmn instead of Omn and has somewhat overhead. It also means the dst vector has to grow much larger than it really needs.p  pThe second has the primary problem of a lot of copying around and again allocationdeallocation of memory.p  pThe data structures used for storingmanaging the spansvectors can be altered if you think thats needed.p  pUpdate Forgot to say how large the datasets are. The most common cases are between 4 and 30 elements in either vector, and either dst is empty or there is a large amount of overlap between the spans in src and dst.p

Negative 4520 pIve always been interested in writing web software like forums or blogs, things which take a limited markup to rewrite into HTML.  But lately, Ive noticed more and more that for PHP, try googling PHP BBCode parser PEAR and test a few out, you either get an inefficient mess, or you get poor code with XSS holes here and there.p  pTaking my previously mentioned example, of the poor BBCode parsers out there, how would you avoid XSS  Ill now take your typical regular expression for handling a link, and you can mention how vulnerable it is and how to avoid it.p  precode Assume input has already been encoded by htmlspecialchars with ENTQUOTES text  pregreplace[url].[url]i,lta href1gt1ltagt, text text  pregreplace[url.].[url]i,lta href1gt2ltagt, text codepre  pHandling image tags are hardly more secure than this.p  pSo I have several specific questions, mostly specific to PHP implementations.p  ol liIs it better practice, in this example, to only match using a uriurl validation expression  Or, is it better to use code.code and a callback, then ascertain whether or not the input is a valid link  As would be obvious above, the codejavascriptalertXSScode would work in the above URL tags, but would fail if the urimatching was done.li liWhat about functions like codeurlencodecode within a callback, would they be any deterrence or problem as far as URI standards goli liWould it be safer to write a fullstack parser  Or, is the time and processing power needed to develop and use such a thing too weighty for something handling several different entries per pageli ol  pI know my example is one of many, and is more specific than some.  However, dont shirk from providing your own.  emSo, Im looking for principles and best practices, and general recommendations for XSSprotection in a textparsing situation.emp

Negative 4520 pIm a user of Aquamacs under OS X, which by default does not recognize .m files as ObjectiveC but instead treats them as matlab files  from the mailing list, the reason for this is that it was felt by the maintainer that he wanted a clean way to distinguish ObjC files from others before he added a solution into the distribution.p  pThus, I was trying to come up with a proper magicmodealist that would help to properly identify ObjectiveC files and switch to the right mode  after some thought, it seemed like all I would nee to check for are the presence of one of three keywordsp  precodeimplementation interface protocol codepre  pAny ObjectveC file should have one of those strings in it, and they also would very likely not not be in a Matlab file.p  pI then tried coming up with a magicmodealist variant to recognize codeimplementationcode, my first try wasp  precodeaddtolist  magicmodealist  .implementation. . objcmode codepre  pBasically  check for implementation anywhere in the file at the start of a line.p  pAfter putting this into my .emacs file though, it seemed to have no effect  opening a .m file with implementation in it, did not switch to ObjC mode.p  pDoes anyone know what the issue might be with my magicmodealist entry  The only examples I could find just matched text at the very beginning of a file for nxmlmode, and not for strings in the middle of a file.  It seems like something must be wrong with my regex, but as noted a few variants of the same theme seemed to have no effect.p  pI have working entries in my .emacs file for automodealist to pull up the right mode today so I dont need any advice on how to do that, Id like to solve this the right way.p  pEDITp  pThanks to the accepted response below, here is the final code I have in my .Emacs filep  precodesetq magicmodealist   append list          .nnimplementation . objcmode        .nninterface . objcmode        .nnprotocol . objcmode       magicmodealist codepre  pNote that I use n as a replacement for  beginning of line in the regex, as its important to accurately determine the type  otherwise the .emacs file itself would come up in objc mode just because implementation was in there.p  pSomething else to be aware of I came across researching this is that magicmodealist is only given a certain number of characters at the beginning of a file to work with defined by codemagicmoderegexpmatchlimitcode, with  default of 4000 characters, presumably for performance reasons.  Normally thats more than enough to find the start of codeimplementationcode or codeinterfacecode blocks, but if you insert revision comments in the headers of files as some people do, you may need to increase this substantially.  Just as a backup, I plan to also include the code that makes .m files always open in objmode using automodealist, since my Matlab days are far behind me  but hopefully this magicmode change can go into the official distribution of Aquamacs at least, if not Emacs 23 itself the regexs probably should be beefed up a little more for that to happen.p

Negative 4520 pPowerShell Script Running as a Service Behaves Strangelyp  pThe Project Create a background process that determines if the on board network card is connected. If it is connected, disable the wireless network card. When the onboard network card is not connected, reenable the wireless card.p  pWhy Users hotdock all the time, getting funky routing tables OR get bound to the wrong DNS servers. When they attempt to access a local resource, say printers, they arent able to and then are in my cube they would file a ticket, but that too would be a local resource. Trying to convince users to disable their own wireless via switch on laptop or not hot dock has met with limited success.p  pThe Problem The PowerShell script below does run, and does work under my testing conditions. Likely under most testing conditions as the code and wmi queries are pretty generic. Running the script manually yields the expected results, HOWEVER running the script as a service via the only method I could find, srvany.exe, yielded unexpected results and broke stuff.p  pDetails Running the script as a service, via srvany.exe, works ONCE. When the loop comes back around to test the network connection or tries the method to enable or disable it. The errors indicate that getwmiobject is not a proper Cmdlet. Huh It works, manually, it works once, but a second time after it disabled the wireless network card it does not. Worse yet MY shell , outside of the service, suddenly cant do a getwmiobject, until. until you go into Device Manager and reenable the wireless network card yourself.p  pDebugging attempts I rewrote the script and cleaned it up a little to allow for it to get the objects outside of the Do While loop. Nothing changed, but I left the script that way as it seems cleaner anyhow. I enabled Interact with Desktop in the service properties and sure enough you can see the script trying to work and getting the before mentioned errors. Please help. Again the object here is to run a background process, one with enough privileges in Vista or 7 to disable and enable the wireless network card.p  precode  switchwifisrv.ps1  This script attempts  to identify if a wired network card is in use if  one is, the Wireless network card is disabled, until the wired network  card is no longer in use.

Negative 4520 pIm sick of waiting for my developers to fix this, so I decided to ask you guys. Im trying to modify what theyve already given me, so sorry if the setup doesnt make a whole lot of sense. I could probably change it but want to keep as much of the existing table setup as possible.p  pIve got a MySQL table with a bunch of entries in it, and a column called Multiplier. The default and most common value for this column is 0, but it could be any number.p  pWhat I need to do is select a single entry from that table at random. However, the rows are weighted according to the number in the Multiplier column. A value of 0 means that its not weighted at all. A value of 1 means that its weighted twice as much, as if the entry were in the table twice. A value of 2 means that its weighted three times as much, as if the entry were in the table three times.p  pIve been trying to figure out how to do this with SELECT and RAND, but dont know how to do the weighting. Is it possiblep

Negative 4520 pMicrosoft recently released tools and documentation for its new Phone 7 platform, which to the dismay of those who have a big C codebase like me doesnt support native development anymore. Although Ive found speculation about this decision being reversed, I doubt it. So I was thinking how viable would be to make this codebase available to Phone 7 by adapting it to compile under CCLI. Of course the user interface parts couldnt be ported, but Im not sure about the rest. Anyone had a similar experience Im not talking about code that does heavy lowlevel stuff  but theres a quite frequent use of templates and smart pointers.p

Negative 4520 pMy project is about a school admin I have a page called  createClass.php, where user inserts grade, profile etc. When he press submit page called createdClass.php is loading. Inside this page I have all code which insert data into database and also an if structure which says  Class already exists if in database is another class with same specifications. Also in second page createdClass.php i have a small table which shows the place of each student. First time all cells are green this means that place is free and if i click one of them appear a popup window which let me to add info about student from that place. If a place is busy the cell will be red take a look here  a hrefhttpscreencast.comtNzM2YzYxNjct relnofollowhttpscreencast.comtNzM2YzYxNjcta.

Negative 4520 pSo, Ive been trying to develop this multiaccordion news section for this site. Its actually all working, thanks to an insightful plugin. Ive modified it a little bit so it works as I want it to, but Ive run into two issues, one which is possibly CSS.p  pIssue 1p  pThe idea for the user is that when they view this page, they see all the recent headlines. They can also see who it has been posted by and how many comments have been made to this article. If they wish, they can then click on the headline and the field will expand into the article. They can then either make a comment or view the comments via clicking the View Comments link or clicking the number of comments link in the Posted by... area a shortcut to the comments basically.p  pThe problem Im having is if I make the AUTHOR or the 0 comments a link, it breaks the accordion because the accordion uses an A CLASS to open it up. Im looking for a fix, Ive tried making it a H1 or a DIV but that also breaks it.p  pIssue 2p  pThis is a pretty picky one, but when you click the headline it expands, but at least in Firefox havent tested it in Chrome yet the text jumps from the right and to the left, locking in place from which the CSS tells it to paddingleft. I dont know why its exactly doing that, if anyone has any insight on that, itd be appreciated.p  pA twoparter to this issue is when you open the Headline to the article and then decide to close the article by clicking on the Headline, parts of the accordion jumps from the darker purple to the light purple before the task is finished. Im also interested fixing this, but this issue in its entirety are all pretty nit picky things.p  pYou can view the demo of the site here a hrefhttpwww.notedls.comdemo relnofollowhttpwww.notedls.comdemoap  pPlease if anyone has any advice or fixes, Id appreciate it, Ive been trying to get this all to work to the best of my ability, but Im clearly no guru or expert.

Then, you want to spawn off 10 threads to each perform some action.  As each thread completes the action, it decrements x. I know you can use interlocked for this, but wouldnt you also need a lock when you evaluate the condition In other words, you need to make sure that x is greater than 0 before you perform the action.p
Negative 4520 pI have a problem where I need to call a threadsafe method i.e. one that uses locking internally if a condition is true. The condition I am checking reads a variable shared among many threads count, so I need to lock when I read it to avoid fuzzy reads. Wouldnt this cause a nested monitor lockout deadlock, since I am locking an already threadsafe method callp  pExample belowp  precodelock this      if count lt 10              someObj.DoSomethingThreadSafe this method has its only locking internally       codepre  pHow would I fix thisp
Negative 4520 pso i have a lightbox in which pops up an aspx page with textboxes and two buttons submit  disabled and cancel  enabled. I wanted to enable my submit button ontextchange. it works fine when opened separately not as a lightbox but when i let it run normally with the lightbox function everytime ontextchange gets triggered the whole page refreshes disabling the lightbox. p  precodeltaspTextBox IDtextBox1 runatserver OnTextChangedOnTextChangedAttributesEdited autopostbacktruegt   protected void OnTextChangedAttributesEditedobject sender, EventArgs e      btnSubmit.Enabled  true   codepre  pnow if i take out the autopostbacktrue it then will not trigger the the ontextchanged. was wondering if is it better if javascript will be the way to go for enabling the button or is there a way where i can prevent the postback when ontextchanged is triggeredp  pthanks a lotp

Negative 4520 pI am making a small game, and I need some more help with it.

I need the Find in order to properly map a DataRow to a DataGridViewRow. I currently just use the row index to map to the DataGridViewRow, but this wont work in all cases if the user physically moves rows, or changes the sort order in the DataGridView UI because then the ids no longer matchupmap.p  pWhen I create the DataView, I load in a DataTable to pass in for creation. This DataTable can be of any form, I do not know what the DataTable contains for columns and rows. Therefore, I cannot create a sort if I dont know any column names to sort by.p  pI was thinking of just taking the first column name column[0]  no matter what it is and using that to sort. But this seems kinda sketchy, nop  pMy question is, is there a better way to determine what to sort my DataView by when column names are unknown p  pThanksp

Java and programming in general started last year at college, but it is something I wish to progress with and make a career out of.p  pThanks Tomp
Negative 4520 pI have created a html form and it stores the data using phpmysql. Now i want to have the user enter there email address and click submit and have a the filled out form sent to them via email.p
Negative 4520 pWhen reading data from ExecuteReader. It returns me data in IDataReader. When I want to fill this data into my entities I will be assigning Non Nullable values in most of the cases to either Nullable types or Non Nullable types, e.g.p  precodeint id string name int age byte[] image  example e  new example e.id  intdr[id] unbox e.name  dr[name].ToString will result in empty string if dr[name] is DBNull e.name  dr[name] is DBNull  null  dr[name].ToString e.age  dr[age] as int  way 1 e.age  dr[age] is DBNull  null  intdr[age] way 2 e.image  dr[image] as byte codepre  pstrongEDITstrongp  pif codeidcode is primary key for the table and is NonNullable. But it is being used in another table where this key could be codeNULLcode then what should be the approach. Should that entity become NULL or exception should be thrown.p
Negative 4520 pSuppose I have a the following in Scalap  precodeobject Foo    var functions List[String gt String]  Nil  can be any type to any type.   def addFuncfString gt String  functions  f  functions  codepre  pAt runtime, I am given codeFoocode with some functions added. I now want to construct a new .class file implementing something like following in Scalap  precodeobject MyObject     def process1sString   call Foo.functions1  codepre  pI then want to save codeMyObjectcode in bytecode that can be executed later on even when codeFoocode is not there. p  pThe above is just an example to show what I want to do . I am given the names codeMyObjectcode, codeprocess1code, and I have to generate an executable file codeMyObject.classcode. The source of codeMyObjectcode is not needed it could well have been Java source. p  pSo, at a high level, we need to take memory snapshot of codeFoo.function1code, convert that snapshot into bytecode to store, and generate bytecode of codeMyObjectcode using this.p  pAll the bytecode engineering libraries I found are too lowlevel, so I was wondering if there is a higher level library that lets me deal with abstract objects such as functions etc. p

Negative 4520 pSorry if the question was not clear. In my app I have 3 tabs on acion bar, further each of the tab has a separate xml layout with two fragments. For first two tabs the layout is similar, but the third tab has a separate xml layout.In first tab, I make rest calls and get the data to be displayed. The left side fragment displays folder list and right side fragment displays the file list. Tab2 is same but it displays the data from SD card. Its basically a file manager. p  pThe third tab is search page which is totally different from the first two fragments.p  pBelow is my question.p  ol liI want to know if I can use different activity for each of the tabs , is this the right design li liSince I am using the main activty to create the layouts required for the fragments, I now have a problem with the third tab, reason being the xml layout and the fragments classes code are completely changed for the third tab. here are the contents of the xml file.li ol  playout for first two tabsp  precodeltLinearLayout xmlnsandroidhttpschemas.android.comapkresandroid     androidorientationhorizontal     androidlayoutwidthmatchparent     androidlayoutheightmatchparent     androidididfrags1gt    ltfragment classTitlesFragment              androidididbrowsetitle             androidvisibilitygone             androidlayoutmarginTopandroidattractionBarSize             androidlayoutheightmatchparent androidlayoutwidth320dipgt      ltfragment classContentFragment              androidididbrowsecontent               androidvisibilitygone             androidlayoutmarginTopandroidattractionBarSize             androidlayoutheightmatchparent androidlayoutwidthmatchparentgt     ltfragmentgt     ltLinearLayoutgt  Layout for the third tab  ltxml version1.0 encodingutf8gt ltLinearLayout  xmlnsandroidhttpschemas.android.comapkresandroid  androidididsettings   androidbackgrounddrawablewindow  androidorientationhorizontal   androidlayoutwidthmatchparent   androidlayoutheightwrapcontent   androidbaselineAlignedtruegt      ltfragment classSearchFragment                               androidididsearchtitle             androidvisibilitygone             androidlayoutmarginTopandroidattractionBarSize             androidlayoutweight1             androidlayoutheightmatchparent              androidlayoutwidth700dp             androidpaddingRight5dipgt      ltfragment classSearchContentFragment             androidididsearchbrowsecontent              androidvisibilitygone             androidlayoutmarginTopandroidattractionBarSize             androidlayoutweight1                   androidlayoutwidthmatchparent                 androidlayoutheightmatchparentgt      ltLinearLayoutgt codepre  pSo when I click from first tab to tab3 search the UI is renedered properly, but I can not come back from tab3 to tab1.

The next question, I earlied said that I get the data from server using rest calls to update tab1 fragments, since I am using the list fragments for tab1 and tab2 , I just do setListAdapter, but with this I am trying to understand if I can implement a backstack or I need a new fragment transaction with every list item click and then add the fragment to the backstack.p  pLet me know, if my question still sounds unclear. p  pThanks, Harshap

Negative 4520 pI have a stored procedure that codeSELECTcodes the codeTOP 1code record from the table and assigns some variables with the values of the columns.

Here is where I have the problem.  Ive tried to use codeHOLDLOCK, UPDLOCK, ROWLOCKcode hints on the first codeSELECTcode statement, but that locks the first record and allows another thread to pick up the next value which Id like in the first thread.  I have also started a codeTRANSACTIONcode within the stored procedure and changed the codeISOLATION LEVELcode to codeREAD COMMITTEDcode, but the second thread is always getting in and taking that next value before the first thread can codeSELECTcode the 10 records where the codeIdcodes match.  p  pDoes anyone have anyone have any ideas on how I should go about this  Is this approach possiblep

Negative 4520 pIve mulled over emDesign Patternsem for some time now and I am just starting to see how I might actually begin incorporating some of these more deliberately in my development work. However, I am still confused about their treatment of MVC in the beginning of the book and how it relates to the rest of the book.p  pMost of the frameworks I have worked with  Spring, Yii, ASP.NET, and even ObjectiveC Cocoa UIKit  cater to the MVC paradigm. I get MVC because to me it is a useful way of classifying objects and how they should message or interact with each other. Plus, these frameworks kind of force it upon you even if you are not setting out to think in the MVC way.p  pI also feel that I understand the premise of emDesign Patternsem they strongreallystrong dont like subclassing, they love abstract interfaces, and they strive for loose coupling. I cant say I fully understand all of the patterns yet or how they are useful, but I am getting a feel for it.p  pMy question is this what is the interplay between MVC and design patterns What were they getting at in the first chapter of the book with the MVC application example Are certain design patterns just not relevant in the MVC paradigm I wonder, for example, how the Command pattern is supposed to fit into MVC. It seems incredibly useful, but do we create a codeCommandModelcode and codeCommandControllercode to send to other controllers Do we just create a codeCommandcode object as prescribed in the book Basically, I am wondering if the ideas of MVC and emDesign Patternsem are wholly disjoint and I just dont understand, or if there are some patterns that do not fit into the mold.p

This is for generating a seofriendly url. Not sure if a negative or a positive lookahead is what I need, or perhaps use something else like codepregmatchcode to accomplish my ends.p

Negative 4520 pI am working with java so I would need a method which would be as operation system independent as possible. What I have is a program that will be running whenever the computer is turned on. The problem I am encountering is when I need to sendreceive files over the internet. I tried putting a script in the startup folder for windows and rc0.d in linux, they work fine but only if the wifi is already connected. I need a way to only run the program after the wifi has been fully connected and it is functional. I was thinking to use like a ping function to see when a  server is up but I am thinking that the users would not be happy to see the command prompt box on their desktop until the internet is actually connected.  Any suggestions are welcomed. p
Negative 4520 pI need to represent a series of elements through time. For designing purposes each of them should have a color to make it simplier to identify each one at a glance. The point is that color each elemnt would make no sense if the difference in color between them is not appreciable by humans.p  pThe only fixed attribute the elements have is their ID. This ID is supossed to differ by one from one element to another, but this is not certain.p  pWhat I look for is a hash function that based on a numeric ID returns an HEX color web format e.g. f62035 that differs ema lotem with the previous ID and the next ID. Also, the HEX color must not be too dark since the background where the elements are displayed is black.p  hr  pExamplep  precodeElement ID 12   Element ID 13  hash12  f46600   hash13  5aa9aa codepre

Negative 4520 pLets say I have a REST method to update a record. That would obviously be a POST because its updating a resource. However in the same motion, a new record in an audit or revision history table needs to be created.p  pIs there a standard or best practice here, of whether to use POST or PUTp  pDoes the REST method come from what is happening on the user side, or does it come from what happens in the databasep  pOne possibility is to call just one method, which updates a record in one table and creates a new record in another table.p  pAnother possibility would be to force that the POST only updates one table, and would require an additional method to do a PUT in the audit table. This forces the use of 2 methods and puts the responsibility on the developer, which Im not too keen on.p

Negative 4520 pIm developing ServerClient application and I have a problem with waiting for input data on input stream.p  pI have thread dedicated to reading input data.

Negative 4520 pI have been trying to find a way to pass a stdvector from native C code into a static method in a CCLI managed class. I am new to C nonmanaged and so it is not surprising I have had no luck with this. What I would like is some pointers as to how a stdvector of any type, but preferably double or int can be converted to managed CCLI arrays andor C arrays. Perhaps this cannot be done since I only see examples to do the opposite i.e. C to native C, for example see httpstackoverflow.comquestions6846880convertsystemarraytostdvector. Below I summarise my abortive attempts.p  pI can pass a double vector such as p  precode   vectorltvectorltdoublegt gt dblvec codepre  pinto a method defined in a native C class where the class is in a CCLI project, but not into a method defined in a ref class also in a CCLI project. The comiler complains that the method in the ref class does not exist candidate function not accessible. I think this is something to do with vector  being foced to be a private variable see for example a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions947213cclicandidatefunctionsnotaccessibleC CLI candidate functions not accessiblea.  p  pAny help would be greatly appreciated.p

Negative 4520 pI am creating an Asteroids clone, but with a few more bells and whistles.p  pAs of right now I have an codeArrayListltAsteroidgtcode that holds all of the asteroids on screen.

There is a noticeable lag when this happens as I also create explosion particles and I assume this is the GC.p  pMy idea was to instead of create new objects on the fly, that I can precreate a pool of them and just reuse them.p  pIs this the right idea Also what is the most organized and efficient way to go about thatp  pAny other ideas would be great as well.

Negative 4520 pIm trying to figure out what the best way to go would be for Entity Framework code generation with a database first approach. I want the complete master description of the model to be the actual database schema with annotations stored in database in tables or extended properties. Not interested in a model first or code first approach. Not opposed to writing custom code to implement if it will yield the highest quality solution. Here are some ideasp  p1 Generate EDMX from the database. Use custom code to add annotations to the EDMX regarding uniqueness and other constraints that are not currently built in to EF. Use T4 templates to generate code from the EDMX.p  p2 Write a custom tool that generates code first classes from the database. No EDMX files in the solution.p  p3 Something elsep  pIt seems like 1 requires deeper knowledge of EF and more actual work than 2, which I am now opposed to if there are significant benefits.p  pAny advicep

Negative 4520 pIn my iOS app, I have four codeUIViewControllercodes, and for the sake of argument lets call them 1, 2, 3, and 4. I have segues leading from one to the next progressively 12, 23, 34. However, in 4 I want there to be a button that can segue back to one. I only pictured one way of doing this, but I couldnt figure out how to implement it...p  pThis way would be to have a segue directly connecting 41, and when the segue is called delete 2 and 3 from memory otherwise the user could keep building up codeUIViewControllercodes since none of them are being removed. I dont know how to delete them from memory since I dont have any variables pointing to them that is, they were created when their respective segues were called, so as far as I know I dont have direct access to them.p  pI dont know if thats the best way, but if you can figure out how to do that or a better way, any help is appreciated p

But the second time we push the same view on the UINavigation stack the same way we did the first time The popViewControllerAnimated does not do anything.

Negative 4520 pWe have put together a very comprehensive database of retailers across the country with specific criteria.  It took over a year of phone interviews, etc., to put together the list.  The list is, of course, not openly available on our site to download as a flat file...that would be silly.  p  pBut all the content is searchable on the site via Google Maps.  So theoretically with enough zipcode searches, someone could eventually grab all the retailer data.  Of course, we dont want that since our whole model is to do the research and interviews required to compile this database and offer it to  endusers for consumption on our site.p  pSo weve come to the conclusion there isnt really any way to protect the data from being taken enmasse but a potentially competing website.  But is there a way to watermark the data  Since the LatLon is precalculated in our db, we dont need the address to be 100 correct.  Were thinking of, say, replacing 1776 3rd St with 1776 Third Street or replacing standard characters with unicode replacements.  This way, if we found this data exactly on a competing site, wed know it was plagiarism.  The downside is if users tried to cutandpaste the modified addresses into their own instance of Google Maps  in some cases the modification would make it difficult.p  pHow have other websites with valuable openlydistributed content tackled this challenge  Any suggestionsp  pThanksp

Negative 4520 pIn Rcpp, there are various Rcpp sugar commands that permit nice vectorised operations in the code. In the code below I move across a data frame, break it into vectors, then use the ifelse and sum sugar commands to compute the mean of v over the rows where x equals either y or y1. All seems to work correctly.p  pstrongJust wondering if there is a neater way than this  e.g. an equivalent of the which command that gives index points satisfying a particular conditionstrong There seems to be a facility available as find in Armadillo but that means using incompatible object types you cant use find and ifelse together.p  pOn the same topic, strongis it possible to get ifelse to accept a compound logical conditionstrong In the example below, for instance, the definition of indic is formed of two ifelse commands, and it would obviously be cleaner as one.

Negative 4520 pSo Ive been looking around for some sort of method to allow me to find the Ycoordinate on a Cubic Bezier Curve, given an xcoordinate on it.p  pIve come across lots of places telling me to treat it a cubic function then attempt to find the roots, which I understand HOWEVER the equation for a Cubic Bezier curve is for xcoords Xt  1t3  X0  31t2  t  X1  31t  t2  X2  t3  X3p  pWhat confuses me is the addition of the 1t values. For instance, if I fill in the X values with some random numbers...p  p400  1t3  100  31t2  t  600  31t  t2  800  t3  800p  pthen rearrange to the Cubic equation stylep  p800t3  31tem800t2  3em1t2600t   1t3100 400  0p  pI still have the trouble of the 1t blocks. I cant work out how I am supposed to solve t when the 1t is unknown in the first place.p  pAny ideasp

Now i get a different error something like codesubrepository newrepo doesnt existcode Well duh im trying to add itp  pSo I finally broke down and had to RAdmin to the server, manually create a newrepo, add it to the codemaincode repo being served by codehgServicecode and commit changes. This seems extremely dirty to me, and what made things even more difficult is that the state of the servers Working Directory was about 6 months out of date, I had to resolve countless problems to update it to the latest rev.p  pThere has to be a better way of doing this.. i cant have users RAdmining in to the co. VCS server every time they need a new repository rightp

Negative 4520 pI have a TabControl that starts with three TabPages in it.  On the first tab there is a NumericUpDown spinner which displays the number of tabs and allows a user to add up to 10 extra tabs.  Once they add more than about 5 or 6 it goes beyond the width of the form and the rest of the tabs are accessible by a couple of leftright arrows at the top.  When going all the way to the right and then using the spinner to go back down to 0 removing all the extra tabs and leave the starting three it removes all tabs from the top of the pane and only by setting the spinner back to 1 does it refresh and display all 4 3 from the start plus the 1 from the spinner.

Ill try again by revealing the application, perhaps the abstraction is making it hard to visualize...p  pThe start dates represent dates on which we receive advice to buy a share. The end dates are dates on which which we received advice to sell it. The sources of advice are different and we are backtesting what would happen if we used the buy advice from one source, but the sell advice from another.  Thus we have two sequences of dates which we want to resolve into pairs  or intervals  over which we would have held a position in the stock.p  pThus we take a date from the startdates buy the stock. So on Nov 5 we buy a position. Now we work through the enddates looking for when we wouldve first been told to sell it  Dec 14.  Now repeat by waiting the buy advice, then the sell advice. So you alternate the lists to get a logical sequence of date pairs.  If at the end were holding an open position we note that by using codeNonecode or supplying a special date to close with.p

Heres the errorp  blockquote   pcode[error]File optbitnamipythonlibpython2.6sitepackagesDjango1.4.1py2.6.eggdjangodbbackendspostgresqlpsycopg2base.py, line 11codep      pcode[error]from django.db import utilscodep      pcode[error]ImportError cannot import name utilscodep blockquote  pNow, why the psql backend cant even import utils from django.db despite it being on the PYTHONPATH is whats bugging me.

Negative 4520 pIm using storyboard to create an iPad app. On the main view I have a toolbar and a bar button item, lets call it show. Then I have dragged a table view controller into the storyboard. I have also added a subclass of UITableViewController to the files and made the class of the dragged table view controller to be that subclass. And I made a popover segue from the show button to the table view controller. It works fine, meaning that when show pressed I see the popover showing the correct data that I set in the table view. What I cannot seem to figure out is how to put a toolbar on top of the table view in the popover. I took a step back and used a UIViewController instead of UITableViewController and still cannot add a toolbar by dragging it to the view. Any help will be appreciated.p

Negative 4520 pI am about to start working on my first mobile HTML5 app. It is NOT a graphically challenging app like a game, but a typical mobile app that interacts with a REST server.p  pI already know Backbone, and zepto is pretty much same as jQuery so I was thinking about using this combination and packaging it with Phonegap.  But then I saw this video from Sencha a hrefhttpsplus.google.comScobleizerpostsZtnZNrCfWv6 relnofollowhttpsplus.google.comScobleizerpostsZtnZNrCfWv6a and am now amazed.p  pI used to think I have to pay for a Sencha license but as the video says, the license is free Although I dont know how they make money if everything is free. Also, they have all the implementations of technicallychallenging browsing modules, like carousel and infinite scrolls.p  pAlthough Ive been using Backbone a lot, I have never done a mobile version Ive never really worried much about reusing cells, etc., so I am wondering how difficult this part is if I wanted to go with Backbonezepto option. I can imagine implementing cell recycle myself and feeling unhappy about how unoptimized it is. But then again, it could be easier than I think. I have no idea what its like. p  pSo please, could you share your experience using Backbone  zepto Also pros and cons of using either option vs. the other. Thank youp
Negative 4520 pI have a problem with a servlet im working on. Its a site for mobile devices on spring framework, using Java and JQuery Mobile, deployed under weblogic. I use the same jsp for an app inside the site which may be different in case of different user roles  logged in  logged out users etc. If i log in and click on the button to the app, it looks correctly. I submit a wrong form, lets say, and a div with an error message appears on top. I click on home, then if i log out or not, then click again on the button, the page comes cached and the error is still displayed. The controller wont be accessed again, only if i input myself the request in the address bar.p  pAny idea what would be the problem  I tried response.setHeader with nocache and other solutions to disable browser caching, because this seems to be the problem, but none seems to work.p  pMy app flows something like this When the button from the homepage is clicked, the request calls the controller which verifies if you are logged in or not, then returns the jsp likep  precodeRequestMappingvalue recharge,method  RequestMethod.GET public String renderorg.springframework.ui.Model model, HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response throws UnsupportedEncodingException        do some checks       return recharge      codepre  pThen when the jsp is loaded, it has the parameters needed to know what to show  hide. If you submit on the jsp, it goes to another function and does some ops. , then return the same jsp with some url parameters.p  pAll links to the app are like p  precodelta href  ltcurl valuemobilesiterechargegt  codepre  pThis seems to happen only if i submit the form in the JSP the url changes. I need those parameters though, so i cant lose them. But i want if the user leaves the page and clicks again to go to the app, all the rendering part to be computed again. Any ideas how could i get past this p  pThanks in advance p  pEDIT Firebug wont show the request when the link is clicked too.p

Negative 4520 pIs it possible to force ASP.NET to generate the same hash part of codeWebResource.axd  ScriptResource.axdcode URL from different web applications  p  pFor example i have codeMyControls.dllcode that has embedded resource codecontrol.jscode and it used in two websites www.site1.com, www.site2.com MyControls.dll exists in bin folder of both sites. For each website, ASP.NET generates the WebResource.axd URL with different hash for control.js.p  pstrongQuestionstrong Can I force somehow that it will be the same resource URL for both sitesp  pWhy I need this.... I use shared CDN for resources from both websites. It works perfect for all resources except codeWebResource.axd  ScriptResource.axdcode. When resource requested from www.site2.com, CDN tries to retrieve resource for cache from www.site1.com, but since the hash that arrived from www.site2.com is different, CDN fails to load and cache resource.p

Negative 4520 pThe following script should demonstrate a problem Im facing using Mojolicious on OpenBSD5.2 using modperl.p  pThe script works fine 4 times being called as CGI under modperl. Additional runs of the script result in Mojolicious not returning the asynchronous posts. The subs that are usually called when data is arriving just dont seem to be called anymore. Running the script from command line works fine since perl is then completely started from scratch and everything is reinitialized, which is not the case under modperl. Stopping and starting Apache reinitializes modperl so that the script can be run another 4 times.p  pI only tested this on OpenBSD5.2 using Mojolicious in the version thats provided in OpenBSDs ports tree 2.76. This is kinda old I think but thats what OpenBSD comes with.p  pAm I doing something completely wrong here Or is it possible that Mojolicious has some circular reference or something which causes this issue p  pI have no influence on the platform OpenBSD being used. So please dont suggest to use Linux and install latest Mojolicious version.

If you split this at white space code code, you will get a list likep  precode[38, y1, , 35, y2, , 31, y3] codepre  pNote now that you can pull every 3rd element and get the coefficients that go into the matrix codeAcode.br Partial answers would bep  precodey1  90 c2  28 x4  41 z100  59 codepre  pIm trying to manipulate them to give me the sum of the entries of the solutions codey1, ..., y3code for the first block of equations, the sum of the entries of the solutions codec1, ..., c6code for the second block of equations, the sum of the entries of the solutions codex1, ..., x13code for the third block of equations, and the sum of the entries of the solutions codez1, ..., z100code for the fourth block of equations.p  pLike, I said  Im able to do this in MATLAB but not in Python so Im probably approaching this from the wrong way but this is what I have so farp  precodeimport pylab f  openequations.txt, r  Lf.readlines  listfinal  []  for line in L linel  line.rstrip listl  linel.split listl  filterNone, listl  for expression in listl codepre  pand ending it withp  precodef.close codepre  pThis was just my go at trying to format the equations to all look the same.

Negative 4520 pI am asking a vexed question that has been partially, to my mind addressed a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions5243562lifecycleofservicethatisstartedandboundherea and a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions3514287androidservicestartserviceandbindserviceherea. Lets say like in many examples we want to create a music application, using say a single activity and a service. We want the service to persist when the Activity is stopped or destroyed. This kind of lifecycle suggests a started servicep  blockquote   pA service is started when an application component such as an   activity starts it by calling startService. Once started, a service   can run in the background indefinitely, even if the component that   started it is destroyedp blockquote  pOk, but we also want to be able to communicate with the service, so we need a service binding. No problem, we have both a bound and started service as a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions3514287androidservicestartserviceandbindservicethis answer suggestsap  ul liAt activity startup or some other point we call a hrefhttpdeveloper.android.comreferenceandroidcontentContext.htmlstartService28android.content.Intent29startServiceali liAfter that we call a hrefhttpdeveloper.android.comreferenceandroidcontentContext.htmlbindService28android.content.Intent,20android.content.ServiceConnection,20int29bindServicea to obtain the a hrefhttpdeveloper.android.comreferenceandroidosIBinder.htmlIBindera interface, and proceed from there.li ul  pSo far so good, but a problem arises from the fact that when the activity starts, we do not know if the service is around or not. It may have been started or it may not have been. The answer could be something likep  ul liAt startup, try to bind to the service use a hrefhttpdeveloper.android.comreferenceandroidcontentContext.htmlbindService28android.content.Intent,20android.content.ServiceConnection,20int29bindServicea without the a hrefhttpdeveloper.android.comreferenceandroidcontentContext.htmlBINDAUTOCREATEBINDAUTOCREATEa flagli liIf that fails, then start the service using codestartServicecode, and then bind to it.li ul  pThis idea is premised on a particular reading of the docs for codebindServicecodep  blockquote   pConnect to an application service, creating it if needed. p blockquote  pIf zero flag means service is not really needed than we are OK.

Negative 4520 pIm embedding a codeJFileChoosercode in my program in my own frame with other custom components in the frame.  Heres a design of my app as it may help visualize my issuesp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.compNE0k.png altHow Im using JFileChooserp  pIf you cant tell, the lists directly under the codeJFramecode titles are codeJFileChooserscode.  The way this is supposed to work is you assign shortcuts to destinations and then when you press those shortcut keys, the selected file moves to the destination.p  pMy strategy for doing this is to assign the shortcut to a codejavax.swing.JComponent.WHENINFOCUSEDWINDOWcode scope of the codeInputMapcode of the entire frame.  p  pBut whats annoying is that something I assume the codeJFileChoosercode keeps on respondingabsorbing key presses I dont want it to.  For example, if I press codeCtrlCcode my shortcut action doesnt get run.  Ive tried this with the native Look and Feel Im using windows 7 and the default LampF and both situations have the same problem.  I think it might be trying to do a copy action of the selected file in the codeJFileChoosercode because if I click on one of the buttons to force it to lose focus, all the sudden my codeCtrlCcode command does emmyem action.  p  pBut, Im not really sure how the codeJFileChoosercode is doing this.  When I call codegetKeyListenerscode on it, it returns an empty array.  Ive also tried clearing its input map for this key combination at all three scopes, and it still seems to be absorbing the keypress.p  pCan anyone give me some sample code that makes the codeJFileChoosercode ignore codeCtrlCcode  Also, itd be helpful if someone could tell me how to debug problems like this in the future.  p  hr  pHere is some code of what Ive tried so far.

Negative 4520 pI know this has to be an easy select but I am having no luck figuring it out. Ive got a table has a field of customer grouping codes and Im trying to get a count of each distinct character 2 through 6 sets. In my past foxpro experience a simple  p  pcodeselect distinct substrcustcode,2,5, count  from a group by 1code  p  pwould work, but this doesnt appear to work in sql server queries. The error message indicated it didnt like using the number reference in the group by so I changed it to custcode but the count just returns 1 for each, as I assume the count is after the distinct occurs so there is only one. If I change the count to codecountdistinct substringcustcode,2,5code and remove the first distinct substring I just get a count of how many different codes exist. Can someone point out what Im doing wrong here Thanks.p

Negative 4520 pAt my organization clients can be enrolled in multiple programs at one time. I have a table with a list of all of the programs a client has been enrolled as unique rows in and the dates they were enrolled in that program.p  pUsing an External join I can take any client name and a date from a table say a table of tests that the clients have completed and have it return all of the programs that client was in on that particular date. If a client was in multiple programs on that date it duplicates the data from that table for each program they were in on that date.p  pThe problem I have is that I am looking for it to only return one program as their Primary Program for each client and date even if they were in multiple programs on that date. I have created a hierarchy for which program should be selected as their primary program and returned.p  pFor Examplep  p1.Inpatientp  p2.Outpatient Clinicalp  p3.Outpatient Vocationalp  p4.Outpatient Recreationalp  pSo if a client was enrolled in Outpatient Clinical, Outpatient Vocational, Outpatient Recreational at the same time on that date it would only return Outpatient Clinical as the program.p  pMy way of thinking for doing this would be to join to the table with the previous programs multiple times like thisp  precodeFROM dbo.TestTable as TestTable  LEFT OUTER JOIN dbo.PreviousPrograms as PreviousPrograms1 ON TestTable.date  PreviousPrograms1.date AND PreviousPrograms1.type  Inpatient  LEFT OUTER JOIN dbo.PreviousPrograms as PreviousPrograms2 ON TestTable.date  PreviousPrograms2.date AND PreviousPrograms2.type  Outpatient Clinical  LEFT OUTER JOIN dbo.PreviousPrograms as PreviousPrograms3 ON TestTable.date  PreviousPrograms3.date AND PreviousPrograms3.type  Outpatient Vocational  LEFT OUTER JOIN dbo.PreviousPrograms as PreviousPrograms4 ON TestTable.date  PreviousPrograms4.date AND PreviousPrograms4.type  Outpatient Recreational codepre  pand then do a condition CASE WHEN in the SELECT statement as suchp  precodeSELECT  CASE          WHEN PreviousPrograms1.name IS NOT NULL             THEN PreviousPrograms1.name         WHEN PreviousPrograms1.name IS NULL AND PreviousPrograms2.name IS NOT NULL             THEN PreviousPrograms2.name         WHEN PreviousPrograms1.name IS NULL AND PreviousPrograms2.name IS NULL AND PreviousPrograms3.name IS NOT NULL             THEN PreviousPrograms3.name         WHEN PreviousPrograms1.name IS NULL AND PreviousPrograms2.name IS NULL AND PreviousPrograms3.name IS NOT NULL AND PreviousPrograms4.name IS NOT NULL             THEN PreviousPrograms4.name         ELSE NULL         END as PrimaryProgram codepre  pThe bigger problem is that in my actual table there are a lot more than just four possible programs it could be and the CASE WHEN select statement and the JOINs are already cumbersome enough.p  pIs there a more efficient way to do either the SELECTs part or the JOIN part Or possibly a better way to do it all togetherp  pIm using SQL Server 2008.p

Program should ask for integers max 100 integers until the users types in zero. Integers can vary from one to one hundred and they are stored in an array that has 100 elements. Numbers are asked for with the askInfo method, which receives the array with numbers as parameter. Method returns the number of integers. The number zero is not saved in the array it is merely used to stop giving input. The given numbers are then copied to another array which size is the amount of given numbers. Copying is done with copyInfo method which receives both arrays as parameters.

This view has a scrollview, and that scroll view has a label.  That label shows two lines of text.  That is all laid out fine and we dont want the scroll view to scroll at this point.  I didnt code to prevent that its just not scrolling.p  pThere is a tap gesture to that last view.  When its tapped, the text label is changed from two lines to 0 lines.  Theres a height constraint using  on the label.  There is a height constraint so that the view does not expand up into the navigation bar.  The views all grow to the right size.

Negative 4520 pI know for sure this is a stupid question but Ive realized after some months developing an small app that really contains a web view, struggling with some feature as a mixed of web  native views for adding a post or notification banners, slide menus, etc, that I do not know how to migrate web areas to a native view. I was thinking the natural way to do it were adding a table view and data to table cells but right now Im not pretty sure about that. Im adding an screenshot about how newsfeed page should look like. As you can see it can contain an image or not, some text and some areas to add a comment hidden while no clicked over Comment button, likes and so on.p  pMy main concern is about to move that layout to a native view and a control that iterates ntimes populating it with data from DB JSON calls are already made in web application making it easier.p  pThanks a lotp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comybCNQ.png altenter image description herep

Negative 4520 pI am using an inherited TableLayoutPanel with DoubleBuffered set to true.  The problem is that my background color of the TableLayoutPanel is AliceBlue, but any group boxes are a noticeably darker blueenough to stand out.  If I take a screen shot and paste e.g. mspaint, the screen shot shows them being the same.  The group box doesnt stand out in the screen shot.  If I turn off DoubleBuffered, I dont see these group boxes standing out as being a darker blue.p  pIts impossible for me to post a screen shot, because any screen shot will show the group box background the same as the background.  p  pHow can I use double buffering and not have group boxes show up a different brightness than the parents backgroundp

Negative 4520 pMany deserializing APIs take streams, and will read to the end of the stream and error out if they run past the end of the serialized object before reaching the end of the stream. In my stream, I serialize several objects in sequence. Then I want to deserialize them from that stream later. I know the length of each object and could tell them how far to read the stream if they took such a parameter, but they dont.p  pI think I could fix this by creating a substream that takes the longer stream as a first argument to its constructor along with a length, after which the substream would claim to be at an end, which would cause the deserializer to terminate and the parent stream would be positioned correctly to start deserializing the next object.p  pSo my question is, is there already a class in the BCL to support this, or does anyone have an example of such a custom streamp  pHint I emamem talking about streams here deliberately, not memory buffers. I know I can read out x bytes from a stream and then base a codeMemoryStreamcode on that, but I cant assume that the entire stream will fit in memory at once.p

What I mean is that strongI only want to store the indeces of the two points that currently have the smaller distance if and only if its distance has just been successfully swaped in the global variablestrong p  precodetypedef struct float gblmindist,                  unsigned int point1,                 unsigned int point2 globalclosestpoints codepre  pSo here, when a thread executes the codeatomicMINcode, if the value that is proposed by that tread to be compared is swapped in the codegblmindistcode then i also need to swap the p1, p2 with the values from the thread. If the codegblmindistcode is not swapped then I dont want to store the points cause this would give wrong points but correct minimum distance. p  pIs there any return value to check if codeatomicCAScode has made the swap p  pAny ideas on how to implement this within the codeatomicMINcodep  pThanks in advancep

Negative 4520 pIm developing a multimedia application, which stream video and audio over RTSP using the liveMedia library.

Negative 4520 pAs a little side project Ive been creating an older microcomputer CPU emulator, mostly based off the 8080s architecture. Its 8bit general purpose registers can a hrefhttpen.wikipedia.orgwikiIntel8080Registers relnofollowaccording to wikipediaa  be used as three 16bit register pairs, as well as the normal 8bit mode. And heres my problem.p  pMy first try at modelling this was individual named bytes and shorts, which worked fine until I reread the specs page and found that the 16bit registers arent actually their own thing. Oops.p  pWhat Im trying now is an array of bytes, with one location for each 8bit register, and two locations reserved for the stackinstruction pointers. This works very well and good for the 8bit registers, and its a lot less of a hassle to manage, but I dont actually know how to convert two bytes to a short in memory. Is that even possible If not, do you have any suggestions on how else to do thisp

Negative 4520 pToday I had a discussion with some colleagues about unit tests. One controversial aspect was whether you need to unit test all the contracts of a function.p  pExamplep  precodepublic void fooNonNull Type1 arg1, NonNull Type2 arg2    requireNonNullarg1   requireNonNullarg2     ...  codepre  pThough I do agree that it is a good idea to check the codeNonNullcode contract in the implementation the codeObjects.requireNonNullcode statements, I disagreed that you should write unit tests for it.p  pHere is an examplep  precode Testexpected  NullpointerException.class  public void fooMustThrowIfArg1IsNull     Type2 dummy  ...    foonull, dummy   codepre  pSo far, I tried to concentrate more on the behavior of the code that you write. As far as I understand the TDD and BDD styles, you always start with a test, then implement just enough to pass the test, and so on. However, I have never seen a TDD or BDD practitioner starting with a test as above.p  pI agree that you should keep your unit tests as simple as possible to isolate different aspects as few assertions as possible. But I fear that a test like codefooMustThrowIfArg1IsNullcode has a higher maintenance cost than benefit, even if you neglect the time need to write it. The only exception that I see are tests for crucial APIs e.g., the Java standard library implementation or Google Guava.p  pAs the topic is highly opinionated, a simple yes or no answer is difficult. It would be helpful to support it with a link to an expert option with a clear recommendation on this topic. Possible sourcesp  ul liA style guide of a company with a deep testing culture e.g., Googleli liA quote or code example by an acknowledged expert on testingli ul  pI found search engines not really helpful and unfortunately I havent read any books about testing yet.p

At this stage, everything is displayed correctly but the algorithm cannot run stepbystep I have searched and tried many, from codeBackgroundWorkercode to codeDispatchercode, but nothing workedp  pemSo, how can I make the algorithm displayed stepbystep Is it possible to do with databinding Or must I choose another way to render the graphemp  pIn WinForm, there is codeSleepcode to stop on each codeNodecode for an amount of time and do some rendering tasks, then move on. But I think that solution only works if the algorithm and rendering task are mixed together.p

How many are active, how much is the current balance, how much was the balance at the start etc. p  pProduct Fact is about different supplement products that a cstomer has. Heshe may or may not have a supplement product. Now this has facts like how much the customer owes in different products, rebate amount etc.p  pNow they both have Dimension Account as common Dim. p  pRelation between Account amp Product is 1M. If an account has supplement product it can be 1, 2 and max 3. If it doesnt have, it is 10 p  pProblem were having is that if we want to slice both fact by Account Dim attribute, we get only the accounts which have supplement product. Becuase I believe Tabular model works on INNER JOINS. In this case I want to have OUTER JOIN. Since Id want to have all accounts come through in the query and where ive matching supplement product then the fact for that products.p  pAny help is appreciated.p

Negative 4520 pam using a VCL form in Delphi, where I have put about 10 edit boxes. These Edit boxes contain values that are related to specific models of solar panels. These values are needed in order to calculate the output power of a solar panel. So far, I am able to type these values in every run with the commandp  precodec0 StrToFloatEdit1.Text codepre  pfor c0 to c10. But, instead of asking the user to manually type these 10 values in each run, is there any way to let the user select one option i.e. a model of a solar panel of a drop down list and these values being filled automatically for them p  pDoes the combobox do such a thing and if yes, how exactly I am sorry, I am a very new Delphi user. Any help much appreciated.p

Negative 4520 pOn our current website that is hosted offsite via another company it is all done with .NET, I simply have access to HTML, JS, and CSS files to edit. A lot of data is output on the page via tokens. On our web page we have a weight token, it grabs the items weight and outputs it between a span tag. So if youre viewing the source itll show the followingp  precodeltspan idordersummaryweightgt78.000000 lbsltspangt codepre  pThe token by default outputs the lbs. What I need to do is have javascript grab the 78.000000, convert it to an integer Im assuming and if that integer, in this case 78.000000 is greater than 50.000000 Id like it append a line after the 78.000000 lbs to say Your weight total is over 50 lbs, we will contact you directly with a shipping charge.

Negative 4520 pBackgroundp  pIm trying to implement hole punching a hrefhttpswww.usenix.orglegacyeventusenix05techgeneralfullpapersfordford.pdf relnofollowhttpswww.usenix.orglegacyeventusenix05techgeneralfullpapersfordford.pdfa.  I have no problem punching a hole when on the same private network e.g. both devices are on my router.  However, when trying to punch through across NATs i.e., using the public ipport, it works only after many repeated  punch attempts.  An observation I noticed, is that on the time it did successfully punch through the firewall, the timing was such that both devices attempted to punch through within 500ms of each other.  Im thinking this is not a concidence and the punches need to be coordinated such that they are synchronized or at least extremely close, maybe lt 500ms  p  pQuestion When a device sends a datagram UDP, how long can the responding device take to respond to it  In other words, by virtue of sending a packet from your device, binded to a specific port, the firewall will allow incoming traffic addressed to the binded port.  p

Negative 4520 pI am currently working on one project and come across a challenge that I am unable to resolve so far. I have tried long and hard and eventually putting my scenarios here as I can get some useful tips. Also, bear with me as I am going to give a whole details of the problem.p  pSo, I have a project that contains the module which calculates the wages of their employees based on their shift timings time is 24 hour format. Now, the pay rate is different according to the timings such as in week days Monday to Friday the pay rate is divided in two sections codeWeek Daycode and codeWeek Night.code Moreover, the codeweekendcode Saturday amp Sunday pay rate is also different than normal days. Finally, there are codepublic holidayscode and they also have different pay rates than rest of the events. Following table shows the summary of the pay ratesp  precode Event          Shift Times                Week Day       06001800                  Week Night     18000600                  Weekend        All day weekend rate       Public holidayAll day public holiday rate  codepre  pNow, this looks really simple if you have to assign pay rates only for that particular day such as the shift is on public holiday then assign public holiday rates but the problem is this is not a case in my project.p  pstrongHow it worksstrongp  pNow, the shift is usually 12 hour long and can fall between two different pay rates such as one employee starts at code0900code and finishes code2100code on codeMondaycode. So, the calculations of hours would be like 9 hours on codeweek daycode pay rate and 3 hours on codeweek nightcode pay rate. Similarly, the employee can do shift in a way that it can fall in  three different pay rates like  shift starts at code2200code Sunday night and finishes at code0900code on the codeMondaycode morning. Therefore, the pay rate hours would be like 2 hours on codeweekendcode rate as the shift starts on Sunday night and and weekend end after 2 hours. So, from code0000code to code0600code 6 hours the  pay rate would be based on codeweek nightcode rate and rest of the hours comes under week day. p  pNow the good news is that I am able to do this up until now. Everything works perfect. Although I have put so many conditions inside it which i believe is not a good practice but for time being i want to make it run. The problem arise when codePublic Holidaycode happens. Now the public holiday is the most difficult part as it can come on any day week day and weekends and have to recheck in every condition and have to do the additions and subtractions of hours which is too complicated and not working. I am able to do the part if the whole shift falls on public holiday. However, when it falls more than one pay rate category then it becomes tough for me to solve the issue. I would not share the public holiday one code as the code is too complicated and you might get confused.However, I am going to share  the code where other pay rate formats are working fine.p  pstrongNotestrong I would advice you to not get any ideas from my code as i want your suggestions and you might run out of ideas if you look at my code. p  precodefunction getHoursBreakDowntime1, time2      hoursForShift  array         weekday gt 0,         weeknight gt 0,         saturday gt 0,         sunday gt 0,         public gt 0           t1  strtotimetime1     t2  strtotimetime2      t1Day  int dateN, t1     t2Day  int dateN, t2      t1Hour  int dateG, t1     t2Hour  int dateG, t2      t1Date  int datej, t1     t2Date  int datej, t2      t1Month  int daten, t1     t2Month  int daten, t2      t1Minutes  rounddatei, t1  60, 2  to substitute, extra     t2Minutes  rounddatei, t2  60, 2  to add, lost       Working days     if t1Daylt6            if t1Hour gt t2Hour t2Hour  24          fori  t1Hour ilt t2Hour i               if igt 6 ampamp i lt 18  t2Day lt 6 ampamp i gt 30                   hoursForShift[weekday]               else if t2Day lt 6  i lt 24                  hoursForShift[weeknight]               else if t2Day  6                  hoursForShift[saturday]               else if t2Day  7                  hoursForShift[sunday]                                t2Hour  t2Hour gt 23  t2Hour  24 t2Hour           Deducting extra minutes from sign in time         if      t1Hour gt 6 ampamp t1Hour lt 18 hoursForShift[weekday]    t1Minutes         else if t1Hour  lt 6  t1Hour gt 18 hoursForShift[weeknight]  t1Minutes           Adding lost minutes to sign out         if      t2Day lt 6 ampamp t2Hour gt 6 ampamp t2Hour lt 18  hoursForShift[weekday]    t2Minutes          else if t2Day lt 6 ampamp t2Hour  lt 6  t2Hour gt 18  hoursForShift[weeknight]  t2Minutes           Adding lost minutes to sign out if, sign out on weekend         if      t2Day  6 hoursForShift[saturday]  t2Minutes         else if t2Day  7 hoursForShift[sunday]  t2Minutes       else          Weekends          if t1Hour gt t2Hour t2Hour  24          fori  t1Hour ilt t2Hour i              if t2Day  1 ampamp i24 lt 12                  hoursForShift[weeknight]               else if t1Day  6 ampamp i lt 24                  hoursForShift[saturday]               else if t1Day  7  t1Day  6 ampamp i gt 24                  hoursForShift[sunday]                                if t2Day  1 hoursForShift[weeknight]  t1Minutes         if t2Day  6 hoursForShift[saturday]  t1Minutes         else if t2Day  7 hoursForShift[sunday]  t1Minutes          if t2Day  1 hoursForShift[weeknight]  t2Minutes         else if t2Day  6 hoursForShift[saturday]  t2Minutes         else if t2Day  7 hoursForShift[sunday]    t2Minutes       codepre  pGood thing is that nothing is coming out from database.

Negative 4520 pIm writing a serverside application in flask  python and have an issue with some data that has to be loaded for calculation. Loading the data about 40 MB takes much longer that processing the server response, and the data never changes, so I want it to be loaded only once, effectively when apache starts up. But no matter what I try, it keeps reloading each time a request comes in and massively slowing things down. I can tell by the print statement shown below, which writes to the apache logs for each request. I want to load the data, and so write that line to the logs, only once on startup. p  pInterestingly, this only happens when the script is run via apache on WSGI  if I run it locally using python from the command line, the data load only happens once, and server responses are much faster. p  pAny thoughtsp  pMy most recent attempt, using flaskcache, is like thisp  precodecache.cachedkeyprefix  mykey def loadhugefile  Do some things and assign data from a large file to loadeddata  print Huge data set loaded  return loadeddata  shareddata  loadhugefile  app.routeuserinput def userresponse  global shareddata  return fairlyquickfunctionargs, shareddata codepre  pEdit  Thanks  using beforefirstrequest and adding WSGIDaemonProcess myApp processes1 to my WSGI config did the trick. Now it keeps the process running and just spins new requests off of it, instead of re running the init each time. p

Negative 4520 pIm trying to come up with a solution that will not allow the user to accidentally make a call to codeajaxcode when some fields on a form were clicked.p  pFor example, I have a form that has City, State and ZipCode dropdownlist.

Negative 4520 pIm currently working on popup with double slideshow inside. Almost everything is done, but there is one last thing.p  pImages in slides are divs with backgroundimage. When all photos required all preloaded and generated, then script enables moving to next slide. Problem is when next slide is showed, then images shows up with minimal delay 200500ms. Image is preloaded and cached in memory, and at single session is saved in DOM on visiblenone. I have to delete this delay. Currently i have added timeout at enabling next slide 200ms, and it helped, but i have to fix it without using timeout. This is function that checks if images are preloaded. p  precodefunction updateStatusSecondPopupLoaderamount, imagesQuery, target     var loaded  amount  imagesQuery.length     ifamountgtloaded         window.setTimeoutfunction             updateStatusSecondPopupLoaderamount, imagesQuery, target         ,100     else         fixBounds       i have to do this without this timeOut         window.setTimeoutfunction             target.childrenimg.attrsrc, imageLocationnext.png                                target.removeClassdisabled         ,200         fixSecondSlideItems       codepre  pThis function at first call have passed few args amount  initial amount of images to load checked just before called by query that is passed in next arg imagesQuery  query that checks how many images are left to load its looks like this .currentslide .bgulnext [attrloadertoLoad] when loaded function removes attrloader from element, target  element affected when preloading are finishedp  pAt enabling next slide to show, it should be loaded already.

The float methods use of codeselfcode is still a little tricky for me I get codeself.xcode and codeself.ycode, but not really sure what self is in that context.  Only mentioning that as it is likely involved in the main part I dont understand, which is the lambda function in the codeclosestcode method.

Negative 4520 pDisclaimer very new to writing VBA macros, but I have done a ton of research on here and other forums while trying to fix this error, all to no avail.  Apologies if this has already been asked and answered, maybe Im not searching correctly.p  pNow to the meat and potatos  Ive been working on a VBA macro in Excel that will allow me top  ol liOpen a new or existing PowerPoint presentationli liPaste a value to, and activate, a specific cell, which in turn populates the spreadsheet using a emvlookupem formulali liCopy the strongvalues onlystrong from the first spreadsheet to a second one and then copy the second spreadsheetli liMake PowerPoint visible and then insert a new slide at a certain pointli liPaste the Excel data to the new slide and position accordingly.li ol  pWhenever I run the macro with the PowerPoint presentation already open, it works perfectly.  If I try to do it without the presentation open, it will prompt me to select the presentation file, open the PowerPoint, run the Excel functions, but then it hangs up when I try to make PowerPoint visible, add a slide, and paste the data.  At Line 57 empptApp.Visible  msoTrueem of the code below, the macro hangs and gives me the Runtime error 91 Object variable or With block variable not set message. I have been banging my head against this wall, but cant seem to find my error. Any help is appreciated.p  pAdditionally, once this is working I plan to tweak it to create and insert a total of 25 slides.

Negative 4520 pI installed the Android Studio.  First it gave me an error installing the builttools21.1.1, but the android 21.1.2 folder was already in there.  I downloaded 21.1.1, which had a folder named android5.0.  I put it alongside the 21.1.2 folder, clicked retry on the error message, and the installation succeeded.  However, there was an error that it couldnt create an AVD.p  pAfter launching the AVD Manager, I set up a new AVD, but when I clicked finished, nothing happened.  It basically failed silently.p  pI launched the SDK Manager as an administrator, and got a couple errors regarding a failure to download a file.p  pInstead of using the AVD Manager in Android Studio, I launched the one in codeUSERPROFILELocalAndroidsdkcode folder.

Negative 4520 pI am having trouble with ambiguous tokens. My grammar defines two productions, a numeric constant of the form strong2e3strong or strong100e1strong, and identifiers of the form strongabcstrong or stronguvw123strong.p  pThe problem is that stronge1strong is a valid identifier, but also constitutes part of a numeric constant. So for example, if my input consists of strong2e3strong, it will be tokenized as a number followed by an identifier strong2strong  stronge3strong, which is not what I want.p  pI could match numeric constants by writing a more general regex that includes the strongestrong, instead of leaving that to a grammar production, but then the token valueimage will require parsing to separate the integer and exponent parts, which is not what I want. This is not what I want.p  pI have attempted to solve this problem by using tokenizer states. Because an identifier cannot begin with a digit, a digit must indicate the beginning of a numeric constant, and so I transition to strongSTATENUMBERstrong. In this state I define an strongestrong token to refer to the exponent part of the numeric constant. I then have a catch everything else token, with the intention of transitioning back to the strongDEFAULTstrong state. In the default state, an strongestrong would been matched by the identifier regex.p  precodeTOKEN     lt digitsequence [09] gt  STATENUMBER   ltSTATENUMBERgt TOKEN     lt exponentprefix e gt   ltSTATENUMBERgt MORE     lt endnumber [] gt  DEFAULT   TOKEN     lt identifier [az] [09,az] gt  codepre  pThis does not work as expected. The character matched by the strongMOREstrong token appears to be discarded instead of becoming the first character of an identifier.p  pId like to know how to write a proper grammar for this. I would prefer it if I did not have to use any inline Java code.p

To be clear, I dont want EVERY row that has ANY match to be assigned the same formatting. That would make it impossible to distinguish the various matches.

Negative 4520 pIm looking at using Tesseract to do some work with PDF files, and so I want to use the library rather than an external executable.p  pI started by downloading the full Tesseract source and looking at building that. Sadly the standard sources dont have any means to build on a nonLinux platform, in my case Windows. There are methods for doing so, and I looked at those.p  pFirstly the VS2008 build doesnt. Im aware that it need Leptonica, but I figured Id tackle that afterwards and just tried to build the existing code. Fails with fatal error C1083 Cannot open include file allheaders.h No such file or directory. Nothing to do with Leptonica at this stage, it simply doesnt work.p  pEven if I were able to get past that, Id have to build Leptonica, and that requires using GNU tools and therefore an installation of Cygwin, so I gave up. I Have a MingW instatllation, Ive never managed to get Cygwin to work in a usable fashion but Im not keen enough to mess with such a complicated and fragile build.p  pSo I decided Id just use the prebuilt binaries which some kind soul creates. Downloaded that from code.google.com. Now I need to look into using the code, so the next obvious step is the Tesseract API example, which states it requires tesseractocr3.02.02win32libincludedirs.zip, no problem, because I already have that now.p  pNo real clue as to where the API example wants the files to be placed, but a little messing about gets them in appropriate locations. Press build and fatal error C1083 Cannot open include file allheaders.h No such file or directory, just like trying to build Tesseract from source.....p  pAnd indeed there is no such file.p  pSo, where is this file p

Negative 4520 pI am working on a HTML5  JavaScript game, the problem I have is that I am using LocalStorage to save users data so they can load it from a previous state. I want to be able to save the data in a place where users can not edit their saved state. With HTML5 if you go to console mode you can easily change the local storage and this will prompt users to change it to skip levels.p  pI am looking for a way to save data like Flash does, but not sure how to go about doing it. I have looked into doing databases, but dont really want to be saving extra trivial saved state for every user who plays a game.p  pAny ideas to how I can save users states in a more hiddensecure wayp

Negative 4520 pI realize that this has been discussed before but havent seen a solution in a simple CASE expression for adding a column in Oracle FTI  which is as far as my experience goes at the moment unfortunately. My end goal is to have an total Weight for each Category only counting the null type entries and only one Weight per ID Dont know why null was chosen as the default Type. I need to break the data apart by Type for a total Cost column which is working fine so I didnt include that in the example data below, but because I have to break the data up by Type, I am having trouble eliminating redundant values in my Total Weight results. p  pMy original column which included redundant weights was as follows  p  precodeSUMCASE Type WHEN null THEN Weight ELSE null  END codepre  pSome additional infop  ul liEach ID can have multiple Types  additionally each ID may not always have A or B but should always have nullli liEach ID can only have one Weight But when broken apart by type the value just repeats and messes up resultsli liEach ID can only have one Category This doesnt really matter since I already separate this out with a Category column in the resultsli ul  pstrongExample Datastrongp  pcodeID Categ. Type    Weight  1   Old    A      1600  1   Old    B      1600  1   Old   null  1600  2   Old    B      400  2   Old   null  400  2   Old   null  400  3   New    A      500  3   New    B      500  3   New   null  500  4   New    A      500  4   New   null  500  4   New   null  500codep  pstrongDesired Resultsstrong code Categ.   Total Weight Old      2000 New      1000codep  pI was trying to figure out how to include a DISTINCT based on ID in the column, but when I put DISTINCT in front of CASE it just eliminates redundant weights so I would just get 500 for Total Weight New.p  pAdditionally, I thought it would be possible to divide the weight by the count of weights before aggregating them, but this didnt seem to work eitherp  precodeSUMCASE Type WHEN null THEN WeightCOUNTCASE Type                     WHEN null                     THEN Weight                     ELSE null                     END ELSE null  END codepre  pI am very appreciative of any help that can be offered, please let me know if there is a simple way to create a column that achieves the desired results.  As it may be apparent, I am pretty new to Oracle, so please let me know if there is any additional information that is needed.p  pThanks, Willp

However the error handler in the module fails to capture errors from static files works for MVC routes etc..p  pI know I can write a http handler that can do this, but I wanted to keep file handling as simple as possible.p  pSo my question is, strongis it even possible to handle static file errors in a http module without getting rid of thestrong codeStaticFilecode stronghttp handlerstrong i.e. providing a path that will override itp  pP.S. I know I can make an aspx error page that could do what I want, but I need to avoid doing redirects and the error page solution would result in no less than two which is no good.p
Negative 4520 pThere are many types of domain objects in my web application, such as codeMemberModelcode, codePostModelcode, codeCreditsModelcode and so on. I find that the type of the object is needed when configuring codeJacksonJsonRedisSerializercode, so I specified codeObject.classcode. But I got error when deserializing objects.p  pTo work around this, Ive got 2 optionsp  ul liUse codeJdkSerializationRedisSerializercode instead. But the result of the serialization is too long so it will consume lots of memory in Redis.li liConfigure serializer for every domian objects, which means if I have 50 domain objects then I have to configure 50 serializers. But this is obviously pretty tedious.li ul  pIs there a graceful way to solve this problem Thanksp

Negative 4520 pI have found a C library from someone else which implements exactly what I need for my computations in codeRcode. Their library contains some 30ish .cpp and .h files that contain countless dependencies on each other. Their library also contains an installer file for matlab, but I would like to make the functionality of this library available in codeRcode. p  pFirst, I thought of using the codesourceCppcode function from package codeRcppcode, but its documentation says it only works with standalone files. So the only option I see for now is to go through all files in said library, copy paste all shared functions in all .cpp files that make use of them to get standalone .cpp files and then codesourceCppcode them all. Is there a better way to make a whole, interdependent C library available in codeRcodep

Negative 4520 pThis seems like it should be handled natively so I am likely doing something wrong.  I have a WCF client which calls an Active STS and uses the token from the RTSR to generate the WSSecurity header included in the call to the RP.  The RP requires that the header be signed, which seems a fair enough request.  However, the WSSecurity header generated by the client does not include a signature and I cannot see how to configured it to do so.  The generated header is below.  As can be seen it contains a signature for the assertion and the subjectconfirmationdata both of which are responsibilities of the STS.  The missing header signature, in my limited understanding, is a responsibility of the client.  So is what configurationcode that needs to be added in order to get a signature block that is a child element of the Security header much like the reference header below.p  pstrongClient Generated

Negative 4520 pI am building an application which downloads files from around 100 ip cameras paralelly over the network throught the day. The files in the camera are of length 1 minute varying around 1.5 to 2.5 Mb in size. Each of the files takes around 10 to 20 secs to download. The server I am using, has a fourcore processeor with 8GB of RAM. The task is to download 1 file from each of the cameras per minute 60 files per hour for 24x7.p  pFirst I tried by creaing as many threads as the number of cameras. This worked well for a relatively small number of cameras but as the numbers increased, I found that the number of files getting downloaded per camera is very less. Even in some days, the downloading is entirely missed for certain cameras. This I thought might be because I am creating one thread per camera, ie around 100 threads, some of the threads might not be getting the CPU at all. So I tried a second method.p  pI kept the number of threads same as that of the number of cores ie 4. So, all the cameras are handled by only four cores. This was done to ensure that the cameras are not getting missed. The code for this was done using the Executer class in Java handling a pool of four threads. As is the case, the files got downloaded from all the cameras. But now, the number of files getting downloaded per camera is very less. That is, in an hour, the server can download only around 15 files from each camera, while it is supposed to download 60 files in an hour as each file is of duration one minute. This can be attributed to the fact that, each thread is handling 25 cameras, and the downloading performed by a particular thread is sequential. That is each thread will serially take up one of the 25 cameras and download from it before taking on the next. And each file takes around 15 secs on an average to get downloaded. p  pThat network bandwidth is very high for the server but the network is slow in the camera side where it has got around 256 to 512 Kbps. p  pHow should I optimize the code or the server config so as to download all the files from the camera. Moreover, the files in the camera are formed in real time, so I have go a single minute to download the files from all the cameras, otherwise, files will get skipped. p

Then, I tried to get the length of the text, using that length as a width of the Text , like this p  precodetextName  new Textcomposite, SWT.BORDER String myText  tree.getSelection[0].getText int length  myText.length textName.setBounds76, 28, length, 21 textName.setTextmyText codepre  pBut, I found that the length of a string and the width of the Text field in SWT, are quite different. So, is there any solution for this purpose Obviously, I can set a higher value to the width.. But, I think, that will not be a good solution.p
