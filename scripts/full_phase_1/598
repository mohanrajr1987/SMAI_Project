Positive 598 pThe specifics for this question are for a mod for Minecraft. In general, the question deals with resizing a threadpool based on system load and CPU availability.p  pI am coming from an Objective C background, and Apples libdispatch Grand Central Dispatch for thread scheduling.p  pThe immediate concern I have is trying to reduce the size of the threadpool when a CMS tenured collection is running. The program in question Minecraft only works well with CMS collections. A much less immediate, but still of interest, is reducing the threadpool size when other programs are demanding significant CPU specifically, either a screen recorder, or a twitch stream.p  pIn Java, I have just found out about deep breathbr Executors, which provide access to thread pools both fixed size, and adjustable size, with cached thread existence to avoid the overhead of constantly recreating new threads, or to avoid the worry of coding threads to pause and resume based on workload,br Executor no s, which is the generic interface for saying Now it is time to execute this runnable,br ExecutorService, which manages the threadpools according to Executor,br ThreadPoolExecutor, which is what actually manages the thread pool, and has the ability to say This is the maximum number of threads to use.p  pUnder normal operation, about 5 times a second, there will be 50 high priority, and 400 low priority operations submitted to the thread pool per user on the server. This is for highpowered machines.p  pWhat I want to do isp  ol liWork with lesspowerful machines. So, if a computer only has 2 cores, and the main program two primary threads, plus some minor assistant threads is already maxing out the CPU, these background tasks will be competing with the main program and the garbage collector. In this case, I dont want to reduce the number of background threads it will probably stay at 2, but I do want to reduce how much work I schedule. So this is just How do I detect when the workload is going up. I suspect that this is just a case of watching the size of the work queue I use when Executors.newCachedThreadPoolli ol  pBut the first problem I cant find anything to return the size of the work queue ThreadPoolExecutor can return the queue, and I can ask that for a size, but newCachedThreadPool only returns an ExecutorService, which doesnt let me query for size or rather, I dont see how to.p  ol start2 lipIf I have enough cores, I want to tell the pool to use more threads. Ideally, enough to keep CPU usage near max. Most of the tasks that I want to run are CPU bound disk IO will be the exception, not the rule concurrency blocking will also be rare. But I dont want to heavily overschedule threads. How do I determine enough threads without going way over the available corespli lipIf, for example, screen recording or streaming activates, CPU core usage by other programs will go up, and then I want to reduce the number of threads as the number of threads go down, and queue backlog goes up, I can reduce the amount of tasks I add to the queue. But I have no idea how to detect this.pli ol

Positive 598 pSo as I understood if you change URL of something in Magento, an entry in codecoreurlrewritecode table is created which redirects new url to previous url. Each time the URL is changed, rewrites are appended, not replaced. If URL of something is changed 100 times, there will be 100 chained rewrites in codecoreurlrewritecode. p  pFirst of all correct me if Im wrong please. Secondly, what problems would there be if all links in the middle of all redirect chains were removed, leaving only the first link and the last link Has anyone done it, was it worth it, were you using any existing scripts and what were the resultsp

Positive 598 pSo I find myself taking advantage of codeheapqcode for some calculations.  However, for the problem I am working on, it runs slow because the heap gets pretty big.p  pI thought I had an option to speed it up.  Rather than creating a giant heap, make it a heap of heaps.  But, surprisingly to me, the more efficient code is significantly slower.  Theres a bit more overhead in that more efficient code, but I really thought it would win by a lot.  Having stripped down the problem, Ive got two functions that do the same net calculation.  codef1code is the naive and faster version.  codef2code is the improved but slower version.  I do some random number generation in both, but I use the same seed, so it really is the same thing.p  precodeimport random import heapq def f1     random.seed1     Q[0]     while Q         value  heapq.heappopQ         print value         if valuelt0.5             for counter in range16                 heapq.heappushQ,value  0.1  random.random1000     print value  def f2     random.seed1     Q[[0]]     while Q         subQ  heapq.heappopQ         value  heapq.heappopsubQ         print value         if subQ             heapq.heappushQ,subQ         newQ  []         if valuelt0.5             for counter in range16                 newQ.appendvalue  0.1  random.random1000             heapq.heapifynewQ             heapq.heappushQ,newQ     print value codepre  pWhy does the heap of heaps codef2code run significantly slower  It should call codeheappushcode the same number of times, and heappop twice as many times.  But the size of the heaps should be significantly smaller, so I expected it to run faster.p

Positive 598 pI have been developing a Cocoa app with Core Data. Initially everything seemed fine, but as I added data to the application, I found that the initial data window took ages to load. To fix that, I moved to another startup window that didnt have the data, so startup was snappy. However, no matter what I do, my first fetch AND my first attempt to load a data window with tables views are always slow. That is, if I fetch slowly and then ask for the data window, both will be slow the first time around. After that, performance is acceptable. p  pI traced through my application and found that while I can quickly step through the program, no matter what, the step that retrieves the persistent store coordinator is incredibly slow ... 15  20 seconds can elapse with a spinning beach ball.p  pIve read elsewhere that I might want to denormalize the data. I dont think that will be sufficient. An earlier version was far less interconnected between the entities, and it still was a slug at startup. Now Im looking at entities that may have as high as 18,000 managed objects. Some of the relations are essential to having the data work correctly. p  pIve also read about the option of employing a separate managed object context in the background. The problem with this is that even this background context would take too long to be usable. If the user tries to run a search, he or she will still be waiting forever for that context to load. I might buy myself a few seconds while the user decides what to type in to the search field, but I cant afford to stall for 25 seconds.p  pI noticed that once data is imported into the persistent store, even searches on a table that is not related to others and only has 1000 objects still takes ages to load. The reason seems to be that its the coordinator retrieval itself thats slow, not the actual fetch or the context.p  pCan anyone point me in the right direction on how to resolve this Thanksp

Positive 598 pim creating a NodeJS server which will transfer large amounts of data over socketIO. i want to know if there is a limit on how large a JSON object can be in NodeJS. i think there are some limitations in browsers about object sizes, but i dont know what limitation there would be for NodeJS.p  pi dont expect the objects to amoun tto much on average, but it should be able to scale up to be able to manage 100mb but that is an extreme size.p  pi was going to store the file into a mongoDB record, but to bypass the requirement of dealing with the filesystem, i though i could keep these files in memory and emit them to the required destination. i wanted to do it this way because i suspect it would be faster than a filesystem writeread operation.p  pof course this method would mean i would need a sickening RAM spec on the system, but assuming the system had sufficient RAM, is there an object size limit imposed by NodeJS p

Positive 598 pI have a UICollectionView with approximately 100 cells with a strongrounded buttonstrong inside each cell. 5 cells per row, so I have to scroll down and up to select the buttons.p  pWhen the buttons are selected, the background image changes. Ive done this in several ways which I expose below. Maybe it is not a very demanding view, but I was wondering what is the less expensive approach in terms of performance.p  pOne solution I found is using an extension of codeUIImagecode  and setting the codebutton.layer.cornerRadiuscode like thisp  precodeextension UIImage    class func imageWithColorcolor UIColor gt UIImage      let rect  CGRectMake0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 1.0      UIGraphicsBeginImageContextWithOptionsrect.size, false, 0     let context  UIGraphicsGetCurrentContext      if let color  color          color.setFill          else          UIColor.whiteColor.setFill           CGContextFillRectcontext, rect      let image  UIGraphicsGetImageFromCurrentImageContext     UIGraphicsEndImageContext      return image  codepre  pand then, setting the button image background withp  precodebutton.layer.cornerRadius  cell.bounds.width  8  2 button.clipsToBounds  true button.setBackgroundImageUIImage.imageWithColorUIColor.greenColor, forState UIControlState.Selected codepre  pIve heard that setting the codelayer.cornerRadiuscode is pretty expensive.p  pAnother approach would be just designing an squared image, in Photoshop or similar, with a circle in the middle and letting the rest transparent and setting it as button background.p  pOr another option, that I still havent tried, I think it could be making an 1 x 1 pixels image with a color and setting the filling of the background as tileI still haven checked the code for this one. But I think this is pretty similar to the first way.p  pWould you solve this questions measuring the performance with any software or just knowing more deeply the Swift languagep

This seems to work when the user logs off from the application. But it doesnt seem to work when the user closes the browser or redirect to a different site.

Negative 598 pSo in my current project I use the JAXB RI with the default Java parser from Suns JRE which I believe is Xerces to unmarshal arbitrary XML.p  pFirst I use XJC to compile an XSD of the following formp  precodeltxml version1.0 encodingutf8 gt  ltxsschema attributeFormDefaultunqualified  elementFormDefaultqualified  xmlnsxshttpwww.w3.org2001XMLSchemagt  ltxselement namefoobargt ... ltxselementgt  ltxsschemagt codepre  pIn the good case everything works as designed.  That is to say if Im passed XML that conforms to this schema then JAXB correctly unmarshals it into an object tree.p  pThe problem comes when Im passed XML with an external DTD references, e.g.p  precodeltxml version1.0 encodingUTF8gt ltDOCTYPE foobar SYSTEM httpblahblahblahfoobar.dtdgt ltfoobargtltfoobargt codepre  pUpon unmarshalling something like this, the SAX parser attempts to load the remote entity httpsomehostfoobar.dtd despite the fact that this snippet clearly does not conform to the schema I compiled earlier with XJC.p  pIn order to circumvent this behavior, since I know that any conformant XML according to the XSD I compiled will never require the loading of a remote entity, I have to define a custom EntityResolver that short circuits the loading of all remote entities.  So instead of doing something likep  precodeMyClass foo  MyClass myJAXBContext.createUnmarshaller.unmarshalmyReader codepre  pIm forced to do thisp  precodeXMLReader myXMLReader  mySAXParser.getXMLReader myXMLReader.setEntityResolvermyCustomEntityResolver SAXSource mySAXSource  new SAXSourcemyXMLReader, new InputSourcemyReader MyClass foo  MyClass myJAXBContext.createUnmarshaller.unmarshalmySAXSource codepre  pSo my ultimate question isp  pWhen unmarshalling with JAXB, should the loading of remote entities by the underlying SAX parser be strongautomaticallystrong short circuited when the XML in question can be recognized as invalid without the loading of those remote entitiesp  pAlso, doesnt this seem like a security issue  Given that JAXWS relies on JAXB under the hood, it seems like I could pass specially crafted XML to any JAXWS based web service and cause the WS host to load any arbitrary URL.p  pIm a relative newbie to this, so theres probably something Im missing.

Negative 598 pwere reevaluating our database upgrade process for our application to try and remove the pain of having to generate all the upgrade scripts for a release at the end of the release cycle.  Were looking to move towards a more evolutionary process, using migrations which are checked in alongside features with a tool such as a hrefhttpcode.google.compmigratordotnet relnofollowmigratordotneta, and this seems like a very clean way of managing schema changes.  p  pHowever, the default data which is shipped with our database is quite regularly subject to change and some of these data updates do not fit well with the migration process.

Negative 598 pConsider Martin Fowlers Patterns Of Enterprise Application Architecture, and the pattern of Front Controller a hrefhttpmartinfowler.comeaaCatalogfrontController.html relnofollowhttpmartinfowler.comeaaCatalogfrontController.htmla Apparently, it uses the singleton pattern. Well, I have a package of classes in php application that work together like Zends Controller Package and there is one class that makes them all usable and since it resembles much of Front Controllers concepts, I named it PackageNameFront. But it shouldnt be a singleton class as opposed to Front Controller, so do I still let it have the name Front If not, what do I name it Since its a quite big package, I just need it to follow conventions as much as possible not in a dogmatic way so it would be readable to other developers.p  pMore info Its not anything related to controllers. Its just an object that works like ZendForm which consolidates use of all the other objects like ZendFormElementX and ZendValidate into one object But I cant just name it PackageName. It has to be PackageNameSomething, and Im just not sire what Something should be. Maybe Handler... I just wanna make sure when someone reads its name, doesnt get confused about its role in the whole Package p

Heres my situationp  pIm working with an Arduino microcontroller, and Im attempting to write two Bash scripts right now running in MacnbspOSnbspX 10.6 which will a print all serial data coming out of the Arduino unit to the standard output, and b allow me to send serial data to the Arduino unit.

However, Ive been searching high and low for days and cant seem to find anything that addresses this issue.p  pWhat is the solutionp

Negative 598 pIve been doing some playing around with POCO objects and EntityFramework. Because of this I have to write my own Context and Repositorys. I would like all repositories to use the same context instance so changes are shared between them. To facilitate this I coded my Context as a Singleton. This way instead of getting a new context and then passing it in the contstructor for all my repositories I can just have the default contstructor get the singleton instance.p  pMy questions are thesep  pDo I need to dispose of a singletonp  pCan I just leave it and rely on garbage collectionp  pIf I need to dispose of it how do I do thatp  pIs this an acceptable practice or is there some reason I shouldnt use the singleton that Im not aware ofp

Negative 598 pWhats the best example or approach youve seen to documenting a CSS frameworkp  pWhat I mean is that CSS styles are rarely independent of the HTML structure  a sidebar class is likely to depend on a series of parent DIVs with particular IDs or classes. The problem this creates is that a developer has to look at the source of existing pages and typically copies them which creates bloat and unnecessary HTML elements. Likewise a designer that wants to change the appearance of a page element has no choice but to look at the HTML source of other pages to try to figure out what context he can depend on.p  pIt seems to me that it should be possible to document the expectations of both the designer and developer which should be easier to use than view source.p
Negative 598 pWhile working on a large project I realized I was making a lot of calls to be scheduled in the future.

I cant use a monitor or mutex, because Run will sleepwait, thus causing a deadlock. What is the right synchronization mechanism to use here If there a mechanism to atomically start the sleepwait process and immediately release the lock, that might solve my problem li How can I verify there is no racecondition li Is this a variation of the producer consumer problem, or is there a more relevant synchronization problemdescription brbr While this is somewhat geared towards C, Id be happy to hear a general solution to this.

Negative 598 pSuppose you have a program that logs timestamp, stockprice to an SQL database every 30 seconds, and you want to generate plots of the stock price over various timescales. If you plot measurements over a 1hour range, its OK to use all 120 samples taken during that time. However, if you want to plot price over a 1year range, you obviously dont want to pull over 1 million samples out of the database. It would be better to pull some representative subset of the samples out of the database.p  pThis reminds me of the Level of Detail technique in computer graphics  as you move farther from a 3d model, a lowerfidelity version of the model can be used.p  pAre there common techniques for representing Level of Detail information in a database, or for quickly querying an evenly spaced subset of data e.g. give me 100 evenly spaced samples from January 2009p  hr  pThe solution Ive come up with so far is to include a levelofdetail column in the database table. If levelofdetail0, the row holds a single instantaneous sample. If levelofdetailn, the row contains an average of the last sampleinterval2n seconds of data, and there are 12n as many rows at this level. The table has an index on levelofdetail, timestamp, and when you want to generate a plot, you calculate an appropriate levelofdetail value based on the number of samples you want and query with that constraint. Disadvantages arep  ul liFor N samples, the table needs to store 2N rowsli liThe client must know to specify an appropriate levelofdetail constraintli liSome process needs to be responsible for building the averaged rows as samples are added to the tableli ul

Negative 598 pI am working on a project that is a customized and specific CMS. In the frontend many of the fields will have prepopulated choices. However for these fields there needs to be an Other option that allows for a user entered text string. The project scope does not want these new other values to be added to the prepopulated lists now or in the further. It is just an exception. The project scope is insistent on this flexibility which is implemented throughout the app.p  pI have database tables that contain all these prepopulated lists. I call these tables my list tables all begin with listp  pMy question is about storing the choices a user makes. If it was not for this flexibility I would store the value as a foreign key to the appropriate list table. However, it makes sense for these fields to store the valuestring rather then the key. The drawbacks are indexing minor, content control minor, global updates i.e. changing a value in the list table will not retroripple through the system unless coded to pretty big issue. p  pI will also mention that storing the data as values and not keys makes the programming and functions much simpler too I am writing a service layer and it cuts down on joins and allows functions to be more generic.p  pStore as a valuestring not a key is the course the team is wanting to go. p  pAm I making a big mistake by doing this Or is this fairly common Are there other issues to considerp  pAlternatives My alternative would be to add the Other string as a new row in the lists table and use a field to make it hidden. p

How would you suggest to handle the files compare between the folders i would like to support copy, delete, edit on those files hence the most suitable version of a file should be on both the server and device after the sync. i thought about making some manifest file in each folder and save in it data on the file like  who change it last and when how much readers does this file havecan it be done as a service of the phone some event of opening a file or a folder and etc.p  pIII.

Negative 598 pIn my nearest future I will have to make a system with C backend and web frontend requirements. At the moment, I dont know much more about it. I think that Frontend will be triggering data delivery, not backend  so no need for Cometlike things.p  pBecause of possibly little experience in this field, Id really appreciate your comments about design decisions I made.p  pFirst of all, I dont like the option of generating HTML from C.  So, C backend will have to communicate with Javascript frontend. Simplest option I see here is Ajax. I think it should be ok, so far.p  pCommucating through Ajax with C backend means that backend should be capable of handling HTTP. Itd be nice to separate backend which provides actual data from HTTP handling functionality.p  pHere I see the place for Node.js. I got an overview of it and thiss the place where all my doubts lie.p  pTo have a HTTP handling server on Node.js, which will have the data backend as a Node.js module I think, it should be ok  but Im not sure that I really need all this asynchronization, so there may be some simpler options Im not aware of How would you make such a systemp  pThanks in advance.p

A dynamic schedule can be updated via the  ResqueScheduler.setschedule and removeschedule methods.  When dynamic is set to true, the scheduler process looks for   schedule changes and applies them on the fly.  Note This feature is only available in gt2.0.0. ResqueScheduler.dynamic  true     end end codepre  pbut every time I run coderake resqueschedulercode it saysp  pLoading Schedule   Schedule empty Set Resque.schedule   Schedules Loadedp  pIf I remove codeResqueScheduler.dynamic  truecode the schedule gets loaded correctly but I need to set this option as the schedule changes over timep

Negative 598 pI am working on a Touch User interface in Swing. While I know this isnt optimal, I am on a short deadline and dont have time to Touchscreen specific GUI packages if there are any. p  pI want my users to be able to swipe their finger across the screen, and the view of a special JScrollPane I made moves with it. The code is very simple p  precode    public class PanScrollPane extends JScrollPane implements MouseMotionListener   public PanScrollPane      super             this.addMouseMotionListenerthis        Override public void mouseDraggedMouseEvent arg0      System.out.printlnMouse Dragged         Override public void mouseMovedMouseEvent arg0      System.out.printlnMouse Moved       codepre  pThe problem Im having is that the JScrollPane is a container for all sorts of JComponents. When I first started working on this, I figured the MouseMovedEvent and MouseDraggedEvent would propagate up the GUI tree, untill they encountered a Component with a listener specifically for that event. Now it seems that any component I add to the panScrollPane blocks any of these MouseMotion events, leaving me unable to pan. p  precode    panScrollPane.addnew JButtonThis thing blocks any mouse motion events codepre  pI figured propagating the MouseEvent by hand adding listeners to every single component and then having them send the event to their parent would work. This, however, is a very timeintensive undertaking and as I would rather spend my time working on other things, I was wondering if any of you know any workaround for this problem.p  pThanks for reading, and hopefully thanks for answering p  pedit To make my intentions clearer. I only want the mousemotion events to be caught by the panPanel, any other event like MouseClick, MouseRelease should be processed normallyp

Negative 598 pI followed a tutorial on how to correctly contain text in a 100 percent height div container however after modifying the HTML and adding new CSS for my clients website, the text seemed to overflow out of the main content div container again. The only solution I found was to create a div tag like codeltdiv styleheight1020pxgtltdivgtcode placed right after the overflowing text but before the ending codeltdivgtcode for the main content div container codeltdiv idcontainergtcode so that the main content div container would stretch down to contain the overflowing text.p  pThe problem with my solution is that I have to set a different height level for the push tag with every page since each page has different length of text and I have to reduce the amount of white space under the text. I have tried codewordwrap breakwordcode which didnt work. The text will overflow if you keep zooming in or you are already on a certain zoom level.

Negative 598 pHeres my scenariop  ol liprocess A spawns child process B and spins threads to drain Bs outputs.li liprocess B spawns daemon process C and drains its outputs, too.li liprocess B finishes, daemon process still lives.li liprocess A finds out that process B exited via process.waitFor. However, its stuck on reading the input streams of process B. Its because B has started a daemon. The input stream receives EOF only when the process C exits.li ol  pThis only happens on Windows. Im using the ProcessBuilder. Herere the solutions I came up with and Id like to hear your feedback as none of the solutions I really likep  ol liI can use jna to spawn the daemon process C. This way I can create a process that is detached enough and process A is not stuck on draining the streams from B. It works but Im not very keen on that solution because it means some native code and lots of that since Im keen on consuming the inputs. Some inspiration how to do it via JNA is here a hrefhttpyajsw.sourceforge.net relnofollowhttpyajsw.sourceforge.neta however it contains way more stuff than mere process starting.li liRun on jre7. Jdk7 brings some new goodies to the ProcessBuilder, e.g. inheritIO stuff that also solves my problem. Apparently, when inheritIO is turned on, I can simply close all streams in the daemon process C which I do anyway because ita daemon and that solves the problem. However, I need to run on jre5li liClose the System.out and System.err in process B embeforeem spawning the daemon process C. Again, it solves the problem but I really need those streams to work in process B as I write useful stuff to them. No good. I hoped I could take advantage of this characteristic by placing some kind of a bootstrap process between B amp C but that didnt solve the problem.li liI dont have that problem on linux so could I only run on linux No, I cant.li liMade the process A drain the outputs of process B in a nonblocking way. This somewhat works but its not convenient. E.g. inputStream.read is not interruptible. I could use inputStream.available but it doesnt distinguish between EOF and zerobytesavailable. So the solution is only good if process A is never interested in Bs output EOF. Also, this solution seems to be more CPU intensive and generally... feels awkward and not really bullet proof.li liRun process C in a dryrun mode where it just checks if it can be started. It tries to start, sends welcome message and exits. Its no longer longrunning so it will not block reads. Process B can gain enough confidence that C can be started and we can use relatively simple JNA code to spawn detached process without consuming its outputs its the consuming of outputs makes the JNArelated code messy and heavyweight. The only problem is that we no longer consumer process C outputs but it can be solved by making C write to a well known file that process B can consume. This solution is more like a big and ugly workaround but kind of workable for us. Anyways, we are trying the solution 1 at the moment.li ol  pI would really appreciate any hintsp

Negative 598 pThe server is a shared Windows hosting server with Hostgator. We are allowed unlimited MS SQL databases and each is allowed unlimited space. Im writing the website in PHP. The data not the DB schema, but the data needs to be versioned such that ideally my client can select the DB version he wants from a select box when he logs in to the website, and then roughly once a month tag the current data, also through a simple form on the website. Ive thought of several theoretical ways to do this and Im not excited about any of them.p  p1 Put a VersionNumber column on every table have a master Version table that lists all versions for the select box at login. When tagged, every row without a version number in every table in the db would be duplicated, and the original would be given a version number.p  pThis seems like the easiest idea for both me and my client, but Im concerned the db would be awfully slow in just a few months, since every table will grow by at least its original size every month. Theres not a whole lot of data, and there probably never will be, in any one version. But multiplying versions in the same table just scares me.p  p2 Duplicate the DB every time we tag.p  pIt looks like this would have to be done manually by my client since the server is shared, so I already dislike the idea. But in addition, the old DBs would have to be able to work with the current website code, and as changes are made to the DB structure over time which is inevitable the old DBs will no longer work with the new website code.p  p3 Create duplicate tables with the version in their name inside the same database every time we tag. Like [v27Employee].p  pThe benefit here over idea 1 would be that no table would get humongous in size, allowing the queries to keep up their speed, and over idea 2 it could theoretically be done easily through the simple website tag form rather than manually by my client. The problems are that the queries in my PHP code are going to get all discombobulated as I try to explain which Employee table is joining with which Address table depending upon which version is selected, since they all have the same name, but different and also that as the code changes, the old DB tables no longer match, same problem as 2.p  pSo, finally, does anyone have any good recommendations Best practices Things they did that worked in the pastp  pThanks guys.p

Negative 598 pI have been looking at TLS recently, and I am unsure as to why it is so secure, but probably thanks to a misunderstanding of how it works. But if the entire handshake is recorded, either using a man in the middle attack or a packet sniffer on the target computer, then any of the remaining communication can be decrypted as you would have all the info that the client and the server used to generate the encryption keys.p  pI doubt there would be such a hole in tls, but could anyone tell me how tls defends against thisp
Negative 598 pIm struggling with the way Spring handles form backing object during a POST. ScreenObject property that has a corresponding input tag in the html form survives the post, as expected.

Negative 598 pIm using MSTest to run some automated tests against a MySQL 5.5.19 DB via the MySQL Connector and using EntityFramework 4.3. p  pIm attempting to use codeTransactionScopecode in my DBaccessing class library to perform a rollback when needed.  Additionally, in my test code I wish to use codeTransactionScopecode to put the DB back into a known state before each test. I use the codeTestInitializecode and codeTestCleanupcode methods to accomplish this.  Those look like sop  precode[TestInitialize] public void MyTestInitialize     testTransScope  new TransactionScopeTransactionScopeOption.RequiresNew   [TestCleanup] public void MyTestCleanup     Transaction.Current.Rollback    testTransScope.Dispose  codepre  pBased on the construction of the codeTransactionScopecode object there in the initialize function, I believe I should be getting a new transaction scope there isnt an ambient one existing so I believe this .RequiresNew isnt technically important here since .Required would produce the same result.  Since I dont specify a timeout value, it provides me with the default timeout, which I understand to be 60 seconds.  Plenty of time for my given test to run.p  pIve got a function called codeAddDessertDessertBiz dessertBizObjectcode which looks, in part, something like thisp  precodeusing var transScope  new TransactionScopeTransactionScopeOption.Required     try            ...       context.Desserts.Adddessert       context.SaveChanges       var dessertId  dessert.Id       DoOtherDessertStuffdessertId, dessertBizObject       transScope.Complete        catch InvalidOperationException ex           Console.WriteLineex.ToString      codepre  pAnd this function is called by one of my tests.p  pSince Ive specified codeTransactionScopeOption.Requiredcode here, I expect that it will use the ambient transaction scope created by the codeMyTestInitializecode function.  p  pMy test is arranged to make this codeDoOtherDessertStuffcode function to fail and throw an exception, so the call to codetransScope.Completecode doesnt happen and the rollback occurs automatically when exiting the codeusingcode block in the codeAddDessertcode function.p  pThe problem I have here is that since it uses the ambient transaction scope created in the codeMyTestInitializecode function, my test codeAssertcode calls dont happen because the transaction scope rollback happened  at least this is what I think is happening.  I verified that codeTransaction.Current.TransactionInformation.Statuscodeis strongTransactionStatus.Abortedstrong, so I feel pretty sure this is whats happening.p  pGreat, so I thought I would change my codeAddDesertcode method to look exactly as above except that I would nest a transaction scope rather than using the ambient one, some my codeusingcode line looks looks like thisp  precodeusing var transScope  new TransactionScopeTransactionScopeOption.RequiresNew codepre  pThe intent here was that I could nest these transaction scopes, let the rollback in my production code occur and then still check my codeAssertcodes in my test code.p  pBut what I am finding is that I get the following errorp  pstrongSystem.IO.IOException Unable to read data from the transport connection  A connection attempt failed because the connected party did not properly respond after a period of time, or established connection failed because connected host failed to respond.strongp  pIdeasp

Negative 598 pFor school I have to make this simple working ToDo website. I have basically finished everything but I cant seem to get date working.p  pWhat I mean with that is that I want the user to be able to choose an expiration date. For example, its 18 april 2012 now and a user is making a task and wants to have it done before 22 april 2012. That should be the expiration date and the user should be able to choose that date. I dont even need the task to be deleted when the time finishes but just that it shows on the task page that thats the expiration date. p  pI have absolutely no clue on how to do this.. I was thinking about input fields for dmY and making it simple by posting it something like this p  pcodedate  POST[date]codep  pIf someone knows where I can find a premade script for this I would surely appreciate it a lot as its been bugging me for days now.p

Negative 598 pI like to ask for some guidance on this topic of sending and receiving files via AS2 or AS3 communications protocol via a .NET C implementation.  I have search for examples or explanation of how you would implement this communication layer to send and receive EDI documents as well as other types of documents.  I have built my own EDI document generator and reader.  Its linked to my eCommerce systems.  We have been working with VCommerce and CommerceHUB for a number of years.  What i cant seem to find much information on is an implementation of what the communication layer looks like for AS2.  I realize the second part to all of this is the generation of certificates for encryption and decryption but I think I have an idea on how to implement that or just create the certificates manually if possible.  Can you guys point me to anything that can either show me an example of the standards to use to send the HTTP message or something like that  I have used the n Software for the communications part up until now but I would really like to do this myself so that its 100 integrated.  For anyone who needs just the server they are great and worth the cost.  Very stable and easy to implement.  For me I have grown beyond being able to use them and need to build my own.p  pThanks so much for any help.p

Negative 598 pFurthering my study of database use in python, I have come up with the following code based on Bryan Moyles excellent examplep  precodefrom os   import system as cmd from time import sleep  as sleep try     from sqlite3 import dbapi2 as sqlite except ImportError     from pysqlite2 import dbapi2 as sqlite  class searchdb     def initself, db, name         self.db  dbconnection         self.name  name         self.dbc  self.db.cursor      def getitemself, item         self.dbc.executeselect  from s limit s, 1  self.name, item         return self.dbc.fetchone  def search     customerid   []     customerids  searchdbdbconnection, customers     for i in range10000         if not None in strcustomerids[i] customerid.appendcustomerids[i]     return customerid   init  dbname  customers dbconnection  sqlite.connectprogram.db dbcurs  dbconnection.cursor  search codepre  pSure, its nothing fantastic, and I know I could probably optimise it a tad more but as you can see, Ive been trying hard to figure out how to search the database. I managed to retrieve entries that contain information in the database, which pulls out an entry number. I was thinking of using if loops to search the appended list values for a GGSemnumberem entry, then using regular expressions to extract the line number  then printing the information relevant to the customer that the GGS number applies to. Has anyone got any ideas how I could do this in a better way Also, I have a for i in range10000, is there a more optimised form of thisp

Negative 598 pWe want to use Orchard for a website. We are creating a custom modulewidget for that cms and in that module we want to use a GridView from DevExpress to show data. We got most of it working, but we cant get callbacks to work. With that i mean things like navigating through pages, sorting rows and moving columns.p  pIf we look in the console we can see that the javascript and ajax callbacks are never executed, we cant figure out why that is so. I have found some topics on the DevExpress site and this site about using DevExpress with Orchard, but i couldnt find anything usefull for my case in those. We also noticed that the methods of our controller are never called, but cannot figure out why not.p  pI found that sometimes jQuery can cause problems for DevExpress controls, so i tried removing all jQuery scripts, but that didnt make a difference. Someone also suggested to put a callbackpanel around te gridview, but that didnt work either.

Ive been unable to find an example setup online that sets up a database for a chefsolo instance, but maybe Im searching for the wrong termsp  pI could write a bash script for setting up the database and user conditional on them not existing, but that does not seem to fit into the cookbook philosophy.

Negative 598 pI have read many strong statements here and elsewhere on the subject of storing arrays in mysql.  The rules of normalization seem to suggest its a bad idea and searching within the stored array fosters inelegant code.  HOWEVER, for the application I am working on it seems like a reasonable solution to store an array in a field.  Im sure that is what everyone wrongly thinks in this position but I cant figure out a better way.  Here is the setupp  pI have a series of tables that store registered students, courses they can take and their performance on each course.  All are normalized to avoid duplication and errors.  I want to be able to generate a myCourses section so after login the student sees courses they are eligible for and courses they have taken but are free to review.  The approach that comes to mind is two arrays myeligiblecourses and mycompletedcourses.  On registration, the student is given a set of courses for which they are eligible.  This could be stored as rows where there are multiple occurrences of studentid, one for each course they can takep  pstudent1 course 1 student1 course 2 student1 course np  pThe table could then be queried for all of student 1s eligible courses and displayed as a list when the student logs in.p  pAlternately, studentid could be a primary key and in a column eligiblecourses there would be an array course 1,course 2, course n.  p  pThere is a table for student performance, to record every course taken and metrics associated with student performance.  It will be queried to report on student performance, quality of course etc but this table will grow quite large.  Im having a hard time believing that the most efficient way to generate a list of mycompletedcourses is to query this table by studentid every time they login just to give them a list of completed courses.p  pOne other complication is that the set of courses a student is eligible is variable and expanding as new courses are developed, which to me seems to suggest that generating a set of new columns for each new course is a bad ideafor example, new coursename, pretestscore, posttestscore, timetocomplete, ...  Also, a table for each new course seems like a complicated solution for the relatively mundane endpoint of generating a simple set of lists.p  pSo to restate the question, is it better to store inelegant arrayed list of eligible and completed courses in a registered student table or dynamically generate these listsp  pIm guessing this is still too vague but any discussion of db design that gives an example of an inelegant array vs a restructured schema would be appreciated.  p

Negative 598 pIm developing an oldfashioned 2D RPG with Python  pyglet.p  pThe map is made of several layers up to 10, each of them consituted of squared tiles 32x32 pixels. The sprites party characters, NPC, and some others things are drawn between two layers usually just before the last.p  pTo render it, I use a single Batch, with many OrderedGroups  one group per layer, and a group per sprite.p  pThe problem with sprites is that they must be rendered in the decreasing order of their y value, so groups are arranged as follow lets suppose theres 3 layers in the map, and that 2 sprites must be drawn just before the last p  precodeg[0]  OrderedGroup0  first layer g[1]  OrderedGroup1  second layer  g[2]  OrderedGroup2  empty, serves as a base for the following  OrderedGroup0, parent  g[2]  the highest sprite OrderedGroup1, parent  g[2]  the lowest sprite  g[3]  OrderedGroup3  the third layer codepre  pWhen I add layersprites to the batch, I specify that they are static. When I add party sprites, they are dynamic.p  pSo my first question  since they all belong to the same batch, isnt it contradictory  said differently  is static or dynamic a property of the sprite object, or of the batch  note  I precise that I have really few knowledge about OpenGL and have no idea how batch and groups are implementedp  pFor the time being, performance is correct I want 60 fps, and I have them up to 8 moving sprites, but perfomance decreases quickly with more than 8 moving sprites which should not happen in the final game, but Id like my engine to be the most efficient possible without translating parts in CASM.p  pSo my second question  is the strategy I choose use batch, and as few as possible the good one p  pThanks in advance for answersp

However it is not exactly crossplatform or am I wrong  and so we turned to Phonegap, which lets you build mobile apps with js, css and html which are technologies which we feel comfortable using.p  pOur apps are going to be very data intensive and might also require to be invoked by the server, i.e. there might be 2way communication between the server and the app. p  pand so my question, given these kind of apps would you suggest phonegap or monoTouchDroidp  pThanks in advance.p

Numbers that exceed the limits of both a hrefhttpdev.mysql.comdocrefman5.0enintegertypes.html relnofollowMySQLas and a hrefhttpwww.postgresql.orgdocs8.2staticdatatypenumeric.html relnofollowPostgreSQLas 4byte INT or INTEGER data type. But thats exactly the data type that Rails adapters translate codeintegercode into.p  h3My workaroundh3  pThat was not an issue in development, since SQLite has only one integer type accepting large numbers. But for stagingproduction i.e. for use with anything embutem SQLite, I had to manually edit the codeschema.rbcode file to replace codet.integer idcode with codet.column id, BIGINTcode.  Then load the schema, import the data, and it works.p  h3The problem with the workaroundh3  pNow, everytime I run a Rails migration to make a minor change to the database schema, the entire codeschema.rbcode file is automatically regenerated, and all my codeidcode columns are just codet.integercode again. As before, this isnt a problem in development SQLite, but it probably will be in production, wont it Id hate to have to drop the database, load the schema and reimport all data every time I need to add or rename a column  Id much rather use migrations for this. p  pThe workaround for me thus far has been to make a backup copy of codeschema.rbcode before migrating, and then to merge the additions made by the migration with my own ones.

Negative 598 pAccording to the ModelViewController pattern, applied heavily in Cocoa Touch, UIViewControllers should always handle the logic behind how a concrete UIView in the scene behaves.p  pI am curious as to how Apple implements its UITableView class while keeping in line with this philosophy. Especially since UITableView inherits from UIScrollView and UIView in turn. p  pWhen you add a UITableView to one of your classes, does it have a UIViewController handling the way it behaves in the background I know that a UITableViewDelegate is in charge of telling the table how many rows it should have, etc. But what about its inner workingsp

Negative 598 pIve noticed that Java String will reuse char array inside it to avoid creating new char array for a new String instance in method such as subString. There are several unpublish constructors in String for this purpose, accepting a char array and two int as range to construct a String instance. p  pBut until today I found that split will also reuse the char arr of original String instance. Now I read a loooooong line from a file, split it with ,  and cut a very limit column for real usage. Because every part of the line secretly holding the reference of the looooong char array, I got an OOO very soon. p  phere is example codep  precodeArrayListltStringgt test  new ArrayListltStringgt3000000 BufferedReader origReader  new BufferedReadernew FileReadernew File         Gfilewithlongline.txt String line  origReader.readLine int i  0 while line  origReader.readLine  null      String name  line.split,[0]     test.addname     i     if i  100000  0          System.out.printlnname       System.out.printlntest.size codepre  pIs there any standard method in JDK to make sure that every String instance that spitted is a real deep copy not shallow copyp  pNow I am using a very ugly workaround to force creating a new String instance p  precodeArrayListltStringgt test  new ArrayListltStringgt3000000 BufferedReader origReader  new BufferedReadernew FileReadernew File         Gfilewithlongline.txt String line  origReader.readLine int i  0 while line  origReader.readLine  null      String name  line.split,[0]  .trim  force creating a String instance     test.addname     i     if i  100000  0          System.out.printlnname       System.out.printlntest.size codepre

Negative 598 pstrongNotestrong While the two answers provided so far on September 6th are interesting, they unfortunately dont address the question. p  pOne of my Android test devices is a HTC One X. This device is known for frequently killing background applications even including the launcher, most infuriatingly because it tends to live on the edge in terms of RAM allocation, presumably due to HTC bloatware. However, for my purposes, this has been extremely useful as it has helped to highlight the effects of various low memory situations and allow me to improve my application to cope with such events. One of the things I have learnt, for instance, is that the codeApplicationcode instance and other codestaticcode resources can be killed even though the codeActivitycode backstack is retained. So, to give a good user experience, the backstack can remain even though the single process running the application, and all the codestaticcodes it holds, has gone. For this reason, my application is now very rugged in terms of gracefully checking the state, and actioning the reinitialization if necessary, of the Singleton data it needs on the resuming of any codeActivitycode.  p  pTo move onto my specific question, I have been seeing a rare symptom that, through code inspection, I believe could only have been caused by a codestaticcode member of one class having been killed and then subsequently reinitialized, while another static resource in one of my library classes has emnotem been reinitialized. I appreciate that such a dependency between two separate codestaticcode resources represents bad design on my part, and I will refactor to avoid this. However, I would like to know if I could possibly be correct in my analysis  that is, is it possible to have a sitation where the backstack is retained, but only emsomeem codestaticcode resources are killed, particularly on a perlibrary  package basisp  pstrongEdit 1strong Ill give a bit more information about the two classes concerned. p  pClass 1 is a class well call codeControllercode. Its emnotem used as a Singleton, but contains a codestaticcode codeMapcode of data to be common across all instances. Its initialised like sop  precodeprivate static MapltString, Stringgt sSomeMetaData  static      sSomeMetaData  new HashMapltString, Stringgt  codepre  pNext, I have a class called codeMyFlyweightFactorycode. This class lives in a emseparate libraryem. This class is a Singletonp  precodeprivate static MyFlyweightFactory instance  new MyFlyweightFactory  public static synchronized MyFlyweightFactory getInstance     return instance      private MyFlyweightFactory   TreeMapltString, MyParserRenderergt images  new TreeMapltString, MyParserRenderergt  codepre  pNow, here is the dependency. The factory class has a getter method to obtain a certain named image object which is constructed by parsing a file from the file system. If the factory hasnt been asked for that image since factory initialization, it parses it from an file its actually an SVG image parser library of mine. The image is parsed into a codeMyParserRenderercode object. When this image parsing happens, the factory also populates some data in the codeControllercode class codesSomeMetaDatacode member. All of the images that the factory holds onto are kept in the codeimagescode member codeTreeMapcode you see above. So, these images are a nonstatic member of a codestaticcode Singleton factory instance. p  pThe rare problem situation seems to be that instances of codeControllercode find that codesSomeMetaDatacode is empty, even though I know that codeMyFlyweightFactorycode has provided some objects from its codeMapcode. This could surely only happen, I believe, if the intance of codeMyFlyweightFactorycode has stayed around and therefore didnt need to reparse the image objects which means that it will emnotem populate codesSomeMetaDatacode ever again, but in the meantime the codestaticcode initializer of codeControllercode has since executed again. I can confirm that codesSomeMetaDatacode is emnotem being codeclearcodeed anywhere else in code. p

Negative 598 pI need to chose a web ui framework for our private intranet enterprise application tomcat  Java  MySQL and I compared Google Closure,Apache wicket, Ext JS, ZK and Vaadin. I have the following requirements. p  p1 license  does not matter if it is a commercial framework as long as it satisfies the rest of the requirements.p  p2 Good widget support  Ext JS and ZK have impressive widget set. In Wicket, we can create our own custom components. How about Closure It is important to have enterprise type of widgets such as complex tables, tree etc. Vaadin has a big list too but most of them are third party addons and so how reliable are theyp  p3 good ajax support  From what I have seen all of them except Wicket has full AJAX support. Looks like Wicket has AJAX support for only a few components. Is it true  p  p4 Security  I understand we have to implement authentication and authorization at the backend. But we still have browser security to take care of and the GUI will change based on the user role. so it should be easy to create dynamic GUIs based on user login. Since Wicket and ZK are server side implementations, I believe it is possible to do it in these frameworks. I saw discussions in Ext JS forums on how to create dynamic GUIs and so it is supported there. How about the other 2 frameworks, Closure and Vaadin ZK provides browser security as well which is a plus.p  p5 Vector graphics  We have to draw some charts and some kind of circuit diagrams. Closure and Ext JS supports Raphael.js. How about ZK, Wicket and Vaadin p  p6 Google maps  We would like to embed interactive google maps in one of the GUI pages. It is easy to do it JS based frameworks. There is a plugin for zk. Any one who used it can you please comment on how good it is Wicket has a plugin too but I read it cannot interact with the server meaning I will not be able to send a request to the server based on user selection. How about vaadin p  p7 Layout Manager  Having a good layout manager is a plus. It will help in creating dynamic GUIs. Ext JS, vaadin and ZK supports many layouts.How about wicket and Closurep  p8 Speed  We dont need blazing fast UI response but it should be acceptable. We do have tables with a few thousand rows displayed in the GUI. I read a lot about Ext JS being very slow. How about other Server based frameworks  Will the round trip cause any speed reduction p  pAny suggestions on which one I should use  Are there any other frameworks other than this that would satisfy these requirements We are mostly java developers and so we would prefer server based framework. But if there is a JS framework that satisfies these conditions and also allows more flexibility, then we wouldnt mind spending some time learning it.p

Negative 598 pI have recently implemented the Google Analytics codeiOS SDK v2code into a number of codeiOS appscode, and I have noticed that there are some seemingly large discrepancies in the reporting that is now being generated. My main concern is that the total event count for my tracking ID is about code50code lower than what my internal metrics suggest it should be. I have spent some time trying to weed out possible issues. p  pFirst I thought I might not have been making the tracking calls to Google from within the app, but those all checked out. Next I tested the theory that the metrics werent making it from the local database out over the network. After setting up wireshark to monitor the network traffic though, this too seemed to be working properly. Next I tried processing the events more slowly as I thought that it might have been the fact that events are fired in short time intervals that might be the problem. After slowing the event fire rate to at most 1 per second and then further to at most 1 per 3 seconds, I was still seeing a roughly code50code event loss when monitoring my test sessions in the web UI. Also, it seemed somewhat random which events would be dropped in the reports that I generated.p  pHere is some other info about my analytics configurationp  ul liDispatch interval of 60sli liManually starting sessionsli liUsing multiple trackersli ul  pStrangely, the android versions of the same apps are not exhibiting the same issue.p  pIf anyone has had similar experience or has any suggestions they would be greatly appreciated.p

Negative 598 pI have multiple view controllers with a strong reference to a subclass of NSObject.  Each view  controller allows the user to mutate this object in some fashion and then passes the object to the next view controller.  Once completed the user can commit these changes and start the process all over with a new instance of the NSObject subclass.  The problem I am experiencing is that some of the view controllers on the stack are retaining the reference to the committed instance.p  pI have tried using weak, and unsafeunretained but that makes it difficult to pass the object between view controllers.p  pI basically need to dealloc an instance of the object once committed, so that any view controllers reference to it will be nil.  However, ARC doesnt allow explicit calls to dealloc.p  pI can solve this using NSNotificationCenter or by using a delegate, but is there a cleaner way of doing thisp  pAny insight would be very much appreciated.

Negative 598 pI am a bit confused about what is the ideologically correct way of using fragments.p  pAs the Android Developers states,p  blockquote   pA Fragment represents a behavior or a portion of user interface in an   Activity. You can combine multiple fragments in a single activity to   build a multipane UI and reuse a fragment in multiple activities. You   can think of a fragment as a modular section of an activity, which has   its own lifecycle, receives its own input events, and which you can   add or remove while the activity is running sort of like a sub   activity that you can reuse in different activities.p blockquote  pAnd alsop  blockquote   pFragments decompose application functionality and UI into reusable   modules Add multiple fragments to a screen to avoid switching   activitiesp blockquote  pAnd my usage of fragments goes the following way I have only one main Activity and a whole bunch of fragments. Instead of starting activities,  I prefer replacing fragments. For example, I have codeFeedsFragmentcode, codeFriendsFragmentcode, codeMessagesFragmentcode, and when I select something from sliding menu, my codeActivitycode just replaces the main codeFragmentcode. If Im launching a Fragment from other Fragment, I put the previous one in backstack.p  pSome fragments require the Activity to change the actionbar, an I do it directly byp  precodeMainActivitygetActivity.setupActionBar codepre  pCurrently I dont have any code that supports tablet layouts as seen in examples on android developers, but Im planning to add it.p  pSo, is this the right way of doing things Or am I completely missing somethingp

Negative 598 pSorry for the horrible title, but basically what I am doing is, I have a template that generates a backbone view when the plus button is pressed.  Its a pretty simple form that has some text inputs, and select drop downs.  I want to validate the form by highlighting the areas that are duplicates.  In my underscore template currently, I havep  precodeltdiv idindex1ltdataIdgtgt codepre  pSo my model that has a dataId property makes the id unique.  Then I can select by attribute to highlight that div in red.  While I was searching on how to select ids that start with something, I came across this post a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions4161869jqueryhowtoselectalltheclasselementsstartwithtextjquery how to select all the class elements start with quottextquotap  pThe author talks about how to use class instead.  What Im doing when I validate is adding a class of style codeerrorcode in order to highlight things in red and stuff.  So iterating through all my child views on the page that were added with the plus button looks likep  precode       var lastIndex1        .eachthis.childViews, function childView              var dataId  childView.model.getdataId              var index1  childView.index1  dataId.val             if lastIndex1  index1                  index1  dataId.addClasserror              else                  lastIndex1  index1                 index1  dataId.removeClasserror                       codepre  pSo basically, I end up iterating through my views, and if that current view has a problem, I add my codeerrorcode class.  I was wondering if this implementation could improved by using some sort of class in the html so I dont have to use dataId at all.  p  pOriginally when I first wrote the code, if I dont add the dataId at the end, then it only highlights one of the ids that are incorrect since multiple items have the same id.  Can classes work for this situation  Thanks in advancep

Thanksp

Negative 598 pGood evening, i read these statement in a blog codeits  NOT safe to replace a StringBuffer object with a StringBuilder in java version earlier than 1.5code  and it seems to be a fact, but theres no apparent reason for that , i know that StringBuffer is extending class java.lang.AbstractStringBuilder. StringBuilder also extends AbstractStringBuilder, so it inherits those methods as well.so from the compilers point of view you can safely replace StringBuffer with StringBuilder. Of course StringBuilder is not synchronized, so if you care about synchronization you cant replace string buffer with string builder so in my point of view synchronization is the only factor that we could think of when replacing string buffer with string builder, but it seems that theres another factor codeJAVA Versioncode but i dont know how these effects the decision, please discuss these point to me.p

The image get uploaded correctly.p  pMy problems is that I need to display the uploaded image after the page is refreshed, but it only displays the images file name as string, I assume it is because the background job is still processing the upload.

Negative 598 pI need to create a usercontrol that behaves like a combobox.  Instances of this combobox will be databound to a certain collection at runtime. i.e a collection of strings, to keep this question as minimal as possible. p  pHowever, this combobox needs to have an exclusion list, which holds entries that are not shown in the dropdown list of the combobox, in the case they do appear in the databound collection. They are filtered out.p  pUp till this point I have managed to create a control that fullfills the requirements.p  p1 However, the screens that use these comboboxes are used to display objects that might have been created before certain entries were manually added to the exclusion list I described above. In these cases I still need to have the comboboxes show the value, even though it is in the exception list. However, in case the user tries to change the value, it should not appear in the dropdown.p  p2 Apart from the exclusion list, I also need to filter the remaining elements based on a simple rule. For simplicity, lets assume I dont want entries with a string length of exactly 7.p  pIm very new to WPF. I have tried over and over, and I see no starting point to implement these last two requirements. Im hoping someone here can point me in the right direction for a way to implement 1 and 2.

Negative 598 pIm developing a fairly complex image uploading function for a website in ASP.NetJavascript, with a WYSIWYG interface base around an image preview, all done client side before the user hits upload. But Ive hit a fundamental snag I dont really know what the user is seeing, before they even start transforming the image.p  pThe Javascript for creating the preview client side is basically this jQuery bitp  precodeinputPhotoUploader.changefunction           var image  this.files[0]     var urlCreator  window.URL  window.webkitURL     imageClientURL  urlCreator.createObjectURLimage      var previewImage  document.createElementimg     previewImage.src  imageClientURL      previewContainer.empty     previewContainer.appendpreviewImage  codepre  pThis creates an image in the previewContainer div based on the file selected in the inputPhotoUploader, without the user actually uploading anything. Great.p  pThe problem is, that file often contains Exif data concerning rotation. The browser strongmightstrong automatically rotate the preview image based on this data at least, on my iPhone it does. It might not, like on every desktop browser Ive tested.p  pEventually the user hits upload, and I get the original file, Exif data and all. But I have no idea how it was displayed to the user. Maybe their browser ignored the Exif data and displayed the image with the incorrect rotation, but the user wants it to look exactly that way and thats how my software should display it. Or maybe it was a quick shot with an iPhone, Safari autorotated it, and the user expects it to be displayed that way to everyone else because thats what the preview showed.p  pAfter the preview is created I do some other fancy image transformations but this basic problem still remains, what did the browser display Right now the way I see it I need to either determine strongifstrong the browser is automatically rotating the preview, or somehow make sure that strongnostrong browser ever does. And I can only come up with ways to do the former, with ugly user agent stuff.p  pIs there a better wayp

Negative 598 pIve been trying to implement a DelayedJob custom job for a very long time, but am not finding much information online in terms of how to do this from start to finish, and am finding almost nothing that is not about sending mass emails Ive read collectiveideas Github intro, Railscasts, SO questions, etc. As someone relatively new to Rails, I imagine that while the instructions are likely clear for someone more experienced, they are not clear enough for someone at my level to understand how to get this to work properly.p  pThe aim of my task is to run the job, and then destroy the object I am aware that DelayedJob destroys all completed jobs, but I also want the object destroyed from my database as well upon completion of the job. p  pPreviously, I was doing this with a DelayedJob noncustom job in my controllers codecreatecode method codeuser.delay.scrapecode, followed by codeuser.delay.destroycode, which worked well.

Negative 598 pI asked a question earlier, but I wasnt really able to explain myself clearly.p  pI made a graphic to hopefully help explain what Im trying to do.p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.como8w4s.png altenter image description herep  pI have two separate tables inside the same database. One table called Consumers with about strong200 fieldsstrong including one called METERNUMBERS. And then one other table called CustomerInfo with about 30 fields including one called Meter. These two meter fields are what the join or whatever method would be based on. The problem is that not all the meter numbers in the two tables match and some are NULL values and some are a value of 0 in both tables.p  pI want to join the information for the records that have matching meter numbers between the two tables, but also keep the NULL and 0 values as their own records. There are NULL and 0 values in both tables but I dont want them to join together.p  pThere are also a few duplicate field names, like Location shown in the graphic. If its easier to fix these duplicate field names manually I can do that, but itd be cool to be able to do it programmatically.p  pstrongThe key is that I need the result in a NEW tablestrongp  pThis process will be a one time thing, not something I would do often.p  pHopefully, I explained this clearly and if anyone can help me out thatd be awesomep  pIf any more information is needed, please let me know.p  pThanks.p

Negative 598 pI am trying to accomplish the same look of my UISearchBar with a TextField within it, as in my iOS 6 app. I have tried to code it in several ways and not yet been successful. The problem is, I am not able to change the TextFields frame in any way since iOS 7. The result is, my TextField takes all the space in the NavigationBar and overrides the UIBarButtonItem menu button to the right.

In order to make the code work in ios7 with a button to the right of the TextField, the TextField must be set as the titleView of the navigationBar. Which was not the case in ios 6.

Negative 598 pI need to implement an authorization mechanism inside a SOA Im currently designing.p  pWell have three services, each one is imposed to only communicate using their public interfaces, so any kind of intercommunication and background processing must involve an authorization against other service endpoints.p  pPlus well have a client application running inside the user browser, which will, of course, need to access resources as well.p  pSo well have both servertoserver and clienttoserver communications servertoserver will be needed when one of the services will need to perform some task involving resources exposed by another service.p  pIm currently looking to implement OAuth2 since Id really like to have a standard authorization framework, and more specifically I was thinking to implement the a hrefhttptools.ietf.orghtmldraftietfoauthv228section1.3.4 relnofollowClient Credentialsa to authorize servertoserver, and a hrefhttptools.ietf.orghtmldraftietfoauthv228section1.3.3 relnofollowResource Owner Password Credentiala for the inbrowser application which will send the user data on login and then forget the password to enhance security.p  pIt should be working well, but it seems Ive found some parts of the specification conflicting with this design becausep  ul liClient Credentials should only allow clients to access their own resource so not acting on users resourcesli liEach endpoint 3 in my case should require a different token, while it would make more sense to me to have the browser client request one and only one token once and then use the same token agains all backendservices using a refresh token whenever the current token expires, making all transparent to the final user, once the session that will only exist inside the client application expires it will delete the refresh token.li liThe 2legged oauth2 schema also seems a good way to handle the clienttoserver communication but it seems to require additional permanent keys alongside userpassword which doesnt seem to make sense to me it would if I only have one client, but looking forward to create new clients it would not make sense to replicate user credentials to authenticate the user in order to get the private key.li ul  pSo my questions arep  ol lican I use a separated Authorization service exposing APIs to have one centralized OAuth2 providerli licanshould I share one token between the client and all backendsli ligiven Id exploit scopes to restrict the current clients abilities who should actually check at requesttime the scope Should it be the Authorization service or the Resource Server itselfli liAny reccomendation of how would you implement a OAuth2 provider in this situationli ol  pId really like to avoid a custom pubkey solution for servicetoservice looking forward for possible 3rd party implementations plus the dev team will be required to have a deep understanding of OAuth2 for other purposes so it would be really nice to use it internally as well.p  pP.S. I have no authentication service, the authentication of client and resource owner will be performed by the Authorization framework itself since it encapsulates user account. But I also have a Users service handling user preferences so it would also be possible to export the resource owner credentials verification there.p
Negative 598 pOK so I have read plenty of examples on here dealing with reading in lines from a text file and splitting them up but im not quite sure I understand how to do it in my situation.  I have a file that is basically separated into three columns as followsp  precode         START  5000          FIND   A          PLUS   B          SAVE   C          STOP     A,      INT    69  B,      INT    420  C,      CRAZY  008484342 codepre  pWhat I am trying to do is read in this .txt file containing the above information. I figured reading in the file line by line would be best, then splitting it into the correct columns. The problem that I am having is the fact that the 1st column is not always here. It is an optional one.  If they were all filled in, im almost positive I could just use use something likep  precode String[] array1  myLine.split, codepre  pAnother idea I had was to split the line based on ,s  then split the line again based on   but im not exactly sure how to do this.  Maybe somthing likep  precode String[] array1  myLine.split,  String[] array2  array1[1].split   codepre  pAlso, is there any way to just read in the file and store each row into like String,  String String then just check for ints vs strings  Maybe in a try catch or likep  precode Scanner input  new ScannerFile         whileinput.hasNext             String str  input.next             try                 b  Integer.parseIntstr               codepre  pI am not sure if this is as hard as a task as im making it but maybe so... Any help with this topic would be appreciated.p  pAfter looking over some more code, I have the following to startp  precode      public static void mainString[] args       String file TEST.txt          try              FileReader input  new FileReaderfile             BufferedReader bufferReader  new BufferedReaderinput              String line              while line  bufferReader.readLine  null                       Is this where I would attempt to split the lines                 System.out.printlnline                            bufferReader.close          catchException e              System.out.printlnError while reading file line by line  e.getMessage                                         codepre  pSo with this, I am successfully reading in the file and displaying the information back to the output console.  Now for separating the lines...  Ill be posting my work as I go, any help and or suggestions would be appreciated  Also thank you to those who have already commented with helping to split the stings, ill be attempting this nowp

Negative 598 pIm having many troubles installing WebSitePanel on an Azure Virtual Machine, with Windows Server 2012.  I followed the steps in a hrefhttpwww.websitepanel.netdocumentationdeploymentguideserverconfigurationpreparingwindowsserver2008r2forwebsitepanelinstallation relnofollowhttpwww.websitepanel.netdocumentationdeploymentguideserverconfigurationpreparingwindowsserver2008r2forwebsitepanelinstallationa and installed everything I needed.p  pThen, I installed the WebSitePanel Standalone Server package with the installer.  I opened the endpoint for the port 9002 on Windows Azure so I pointed my browser to myhostname.cloudapp.net note in Azure you dont have a static IP address, instead you have an hostname like [hostname].cloudapp.net.  So, loading myhostname.cloudapp.net9002 fails, and any browser shows something like Unable to load page. I think its a 400 or a 500 server error.p  pHow come IIS works perfectly on the server, in fact the default website runs without problems on port 80.p

Negative 598 pIm using Windows Native Wifi. Basically after knowing what type of authentication and encryption the Wifi hotspot have, I ask the user for the passphrase, then call codeWlanSetProfilecode to createsave a profile with the passphrase included, and then call codeWlanConnectcode to connect using this profile.p  pThis procedure works in connecting to the internet as long as the passphrase is correct. If the passphrase is very short and obviously not the correct one, I can detect it since the codeWlanSetProfilecode will return an appropriate error code. However, when the passphrase is just wrong meaning it is a valid string, the profile is still created, but the Wifi connection is just limited access since I can no longer connect to the internet using this profile. p  pThe problem is, I have no idea how to determine if the passphrase is wrong in the first place. Is there an API or a procedure that I can use to validate if the passphrase is correct or notp

Negative 598 pI am working on a project that requires me to detect and track a human in a live video from a webcam connected to a Beagleboard xm. I have completed this task using Opencv in pixel domain. The results on the board are very accurate but extremely slow. Many people have suggested me to leave pixel domain and do the same task in an h.264MPEG4 compressed video as it would extremely reduce the computational overhead. I have read many research papers but failed to discover any strongsoftware platform or a librarystrong that I can use to analyze and process h.264 compressed videos. I will be thankful if someone can suggest me some library for h.264 compressed video analysis and guide me further.p  pThanks and Regards.    p
Negative 598 pRecently I found out that C allows for p  blockquote   pa hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibraryvstudio87d83y5b.aspxAn interface can inherit from one or more base interfacesa.p blockquote  pFor instance, the codeIScreencode in Caliburn.Micro does this in a hrefhttpcaliburnmicro.codeplex.comSourceControllatestsrcCaliburn.MicroIScreen.cshttpcaliburnmicro.codeplex.comSourceControllatestsrcCaliburn.MicroIScreen.csap  precodenamespace Caliburn.Micro      public interface IScreen  IHaveDisplayName, IActivate, IDeactivate,          IGuardClose, INotifyPropertyChangedEx            codepre  pI get why this is useful, as it implies that a class implementing codeIScreencode also needs to implement the other interfaces.p  pBut I wonder how the C handles that compiler and runtime wise. p  pA little backgroundcontext of this questionp  pI come from a background where interfaces define a methodtable, and that classes implementing interfaces have both their own method table, and pointers to the method tables of the interfaces they implement.p  pSub questions swirling my mind stem from various multiple class inheritance discussions I had with people in the past, of which I think they apply to this case as wellp  ul liHaving an interface be able to inherit from multiple base interfaces, how would the order of methods in that table be li liWhat if those interfaces have common ancestors would those methods appear multiple times in the tableli liWhat if those interfaces have different ancestors, but similar method names li ul  pIm using the word methods here, implying that a property defined in an interface will have a get or set method.p  pAny insight into this is much appreciated, as well as tips on how to phrase this question better.p

Negative 598 pInstead of maintaining two installation projects for x86 and x64, I would like to use multiple Configurations and Release Flags to build both. I understand marking a component as x64 component prevents the installation from being run on 32bit machines, however is this absolutely necessary for ALL components, at the Feature level, as described a hrefhttpwww.installationdeveloper.com175564bitinstallationdevelopmentininstallshieldscenario3 relnofollowherea Ideally, I would only have to create x64 versions of components which matter, such as those with bitnesssensitive registry settings, COM and registry reflection options. I have over 500 components which would need to be duplicated..and this is just the first of the ten installers I need to maintain.p  pIs it safe to just make some 64bit components marked as 64bit componentsp

Negative 598 pI was asked an interview question given a 6 byte input, which got from a big endian machine, please implement a function to converttypecast it to 8 bytes, assume we do not know the endian of the machine running this function.   p  pThe point of the question seems to test my understanding of endianess because I was asked whether I know endianess before this question.p  pI do not know how to answer the question. e.g. do I need to pad 6 byte to 8 byte first and how Here is my code. is it correct    p  precode bool isBigEndian   int num  1   char b  charampnum   return b  falsetrue        long long convertchar arr[] size is 6    long long res  long longmalloclong long...check res is NULL...    if isBigEnian            forint i  0 ilt 6 i            memsetres, i2, arr[i]        else           forint i  0 ilt 6 i            memsetres, i2, arr[61i]        return res assume caller will free res.   codepre  pupdate to answer that my question is not clear, I just found a link a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions12240299convertbytestointuintincConvert Bytes to Int  uint in Ca with the similar question. based on my understanding of that, endianess of the host does matters. suppose if input is char array[]  01,02,03,04,05,06, then if host is little endian, output is stored as 00,00,06,05,04,03,02,01, if big endian, output will be stored as 00,00,01,02,03,04,05,06, in both case, the 0000 are padded at beginning.  p  pI am a kind of understand now in the other machine, suppose there is a number xyz  010203040506  because it is bigendian and 01 is MSB. so it is stored as char array  01,02,03,04,05,06 where 01 has lowest address. then in this machine, if the machine is also big endian. it should be stored as 00,00,01,02,03,04,05,06  where 01 is still MSB, so that it is cast to the same number int64 xyz2  0000010203040506.   but if the machine is little endian, it should be stored as 00,00,06,05,04,03,02,01  where 01 is MSB has highest address in order for int32 xyz2  0000010203040506.p  pplease let me know if my undestanding is incorrect. and Can anybody tell me why 0000 is always padded at beginning no matter what endianess  shouldnt it be padded at the end if this machine is little endian since 00 is Most sign bytep

I have extensive error handling for user and admin so im using a class for that so i dont clutter up the code. Im using a helper function and im using the database class which has all the sql stuff.p  pThere are several situations where a database function is using functions in both error handling and functions for emailing the admin. I could just lump everything into 1 big class and solve my issue but that wouldnt be efficient.p  pI can use global functions and global errorHandling within each individual function when i need it but that seems repetitive. Is there a better way to handle this or can you point me to an article or reading that deals with this. Ive tried googling but a lot of the tutorials are very general and im finding it difficult to find something that deals with my specific issue. I also know about extend but it doesnt feel like an appropriate situation for extending the database class and i can still only extend one class i believe.p  pThe problem comes when i try and usep  perrorHandlingdatabaseconnectionp  pwithin the database class. If i do that i get an error Call to a member function databaseconnection on a nonobject or something similarp

Negative 598 pText rendering is one of the hard topic to be understood for most new comers. and right now, i got stuck here. well id like to ask wheter my way is good idea to render text.. OpenGL does not have builtin functionality to render text to the screen, thats make me confused. after searching, that the text render is using bitmap.p  pstrongLoad and bind bitmap font texture  Parse text and generate and bind vertices array, mapping texture with uv array,...  Render it to screenstrongp  pok this may can solve how to render text, but i still stuck. for example what if i make strongtimer based Textstrong  that change every strongmillisecondstrong since i draw text just like  MinuteSecondMili Second this is not good idea right since i must repeat that algorithm while i want to change the text. i guess if we keep using bitmap the machine would get slower.p  pwell, seeing bitmap text rendering is so slow, i make some way to render text without bitmap perhaps it would be get better thats why i ask herep  phere is how i draw character model with strong3d Vertex  GLOrthostrong just take look at my vector font code example How to draw L character with Vectorp  precode    const float MAXHEIGHT  18.0f set maximum height of character     const float MAXWIDTH  20.0f  set maximum width of character  void drawLGLfloat x,GLfloat y            glPushMatrix         ive set before glOrtho0, Window.width, Window.height, 0, 0, 1         glTranslatefx,y,0.0f         glBeginGLQUADS         glVertex3f0.0f,0.0f,0.0f       draw vertical quad         glVertex3f3.0f,0.0f,0.0f         glVertex3f3.0f,MAXHEIGHT,0.0f         glVertex3f0.0f,MAXHEIGHT,0.0f          glNormal3f0.0f,MAXHEIGHT,0.0f  draw horizontal quad         glVertex3f2.0f,MAXHEIGHT,0.0f         glVertex3fMAXWIDTH  10.0f,MAXHEIGHT,0.0f         glVertex3fMAXWIDTH  10.0f,MAXHEIGHT  3.0f,0.0f         glVertex3f2.0f,MAXHEIGHT  3.0f,0.0f         glEnd         glPopMatrix      codepre  pthere are some advantages if we draw character with vectorGLQUAD vertex if you would like to resize the font will not getting blur.p  pthe question now will this getting slower if i make timer based text that change every Milisecond  with this way, repeat the algorithm is unnecessary if im gonna change the text. they are not even consume much resource because its not bitmap, it just vector rendering.p

Negative 598 pSo lets say we are given the endpoints A, B, B, C, C, D, then we can form the route A  B  C.p  pNote that the order the endpoints are given is random. So A, B, C, D, B, C would also have yielded the route A  B  C.p  pBut in general, if we are given ordered pairs of endpoints, how to construct the routep  pIm not sure what data structure is most helpful here. Im thinking of storing each coordinates x,y into a list as the inputs are read in.p  pSo A, B, C, D would be stored as A, B, C, D. Whether each element is x or y coordinates can be determined by the parity of its position in the list so the 1st entry in the list is x, 2nd entry is y, 3rd is x, etc. Then as each ordered pair is read in, we look up the list to see if either the x or y coordinate is already in the list. If so, we connect.p  pTo demonstrate, suppose we are reading in A, B, C, D, B, C, our list would be A, B, C, D after C, D is just read. When B, C is read, we see that B is already in the list. So we know A  B  C. Also C is in the list, and we have A B  C  D, and then we add B, C to the list to form A, B, C, D, B, C.p  pMy difficult is how do we store A  B  C What data structure should I use How do we keep track of the partial route we have formed as we gop  pThank youp

Negative 598 pIts been a while since Ive programmed in Visual Basic, but I have a text file thats generated often from a third party that I need to pull various data from and place it into an Excel spreadsheet.p  pFirst of all, I need to create some sort of loop or array I think in order to run through the text file and find the same data from multiple records in the text file and put that data in Excel.p  pThe code I have so far does what I need, except that it only finds the first instance of the text its searching for, then it stops.  Also, if the length of the data in the fields changes, I need the VBA code to adjust to compensate for that.  For example, if the first receiver name the program comes across is Dave Smith 10 characters, and the next receiver name it comes across in the program is Dan Johnson 11 characters, it needs to be able to read in the information correctly, whereas now I have it hard coded to read the number of characters in the first instance of the sample file Im working with.p  pBelow is the Excel VBA code I have so far.

Negative 598 pI am trying to create a webpage including an iframe where the iframe has customizable content. Its an API project. My main issue is not how to manage appending content to an iframe using jQuery, but in this case I have an empty iframe where I want to insert a full webpage into it. The code for the webpage going into the iframe is received using a .post function where I in return get the full webpage in the data variable.  I cant manage to insert the full code, which include local javascript with important javascript libraries. It is as if it doesnt execute the code inside the iframe. The code is inserted but all the main htmlbody etc tags are deleted from the code passed in data variable, which prevents various javascript code from working. I have of course checked that the page received in data variable is ALL of the code. It is correct. The missing tags are missing when displayed in the iframe.p  pparent page, domain unknown to me as a API providerp  precodeltbodygt ltiframe idEMSNLframe srcdoc seamlessgtltiframegt  ltscriptgt EMSNLframe.loadfunction   .posthttpsapi.educationalmedia.seAPIdisplayNTNewsLetterMenu,      ResUID[secret code],   MenuLanguageEnglish,   PDFLanguage  Blank for all languages, or state a language    ,   functiondata,status     EMSNLframe.contents.findhtml.htmldata lt this is the line I need a solution for If there is any.

The problem Im working on now has me looking at a 1000digit number and finding the sequence of five consecutive digits with the greatest product.p  precodebignum  1000digit number numarray  bignum.split.mapamptoi biggest  0 prod  1  0..995.each do x  0..4.each do y    prod  numarray[xy]  end  biggest  prod if prod gt biggest  prod  0 end  puts biggest codepre  pThis gives me 882, which is incorrect. To look for the problem, I had it print the values of x and y for each iteration. After the first iteration, it always prints out the five values of y as code7,3,1,6,7code, which, when all multiplied together, equal 882. So, after the first iteration of the outer loop, its not looking past the first five values of codenumarraycode, even though x seems to be incrementing properly. For the life of me, I cant figure out why its behaving this way.p

Negative 598 pThe work Im doing requires us to store CRC16 checksums along with rows of data, and recently Ive discovered that the performance of sun.misc.CRC16 is one of the primary bottlenecks in the code that were running.p  pIve found out from searching that implementing CRC16 with a lookup table will give me the performance gains Im looking for, but also that there are many different standards.  Since it will likely take some time to try to get any kind of answer about what the users actually want, in the meantime I want to replace sun.misc.CRC16 with its lookuptablefunctionalequivalent.  However, a hrefhttpwww.docjar.comhtmlapisunmiscCRC16.java.html relnofollowthe only real documentationsource I am able to find on the class itselfa doesnt really elaborateor at least, my understanding of CRC isnt good enough yet.p

I understand this still requires checking for each month in a quarter if the contract is active betw. start of contract and end of contract start plus duration in months. p  pHere comes my questionp  pIs there an easy way to develop the code to do the same for a quarter a year, any period Ie. to check if the contract is active for several months in a given period quarter, year And then sum the values of active contractsduration in months for each customerp  pThank you very much for all the help.p  pJacekp  pEDIT  In the case of one quarter, for one customer or surname, the calculation should test in how many months in the quarter or in the year, or in the specified period the contract is active.p  precode            m1   m2  m3    contr1   50   50   0   contract ended in m2    contr2   0     0  20   contract starts in m3    contr3   10   10  10   contract started 1y ego and will continue well into 2015 etc. codepre  pFor this single surname, the sum for the quarter should give 150. p  pEDIT2p  pI am now thinking how to perhaps use a loop to calculate how many months in a quarter or a year, or a given period the contract was active. Eg. I am trying to develop a loop, sopmething like It is not actually any working code but an idea what I think needs to be done, I am not a programmer unfortunatelyp  precode i do not know what to do with it yet... DECLARE I INT, N INT  DECLARE StartDate DATETIME EndDate DATETIME SET I  1 SET N  0 SET QueryStartDate  20120101 SET EndDate  DateAdd m,[Durmths], [Startdate]   WHILE I lt 3 BEGIN     SET N  N  iifDateSerialyear[Startdate]month[Startdate]I11  lt QueryStartDate AND EndDate gt DateSerialyearStartDate,monthStartDateI, 0,1,0     SET I  I  1 END  i do not know what to do with it yet... codepre  pIt would return the number of months the contract was active  N. I would use it to multiply my contractduration in months in the initial code. I am trying now to read how to incorporate it in my initial code.  p

Negative 598 pIm new to the Dart language, and Im trying to find out a way to parse Dart programs. p  pWhat I would like to accomplish with this is to implement a tool that would rewrite a program with fields that have metadata annotations, and replace all direct annotated field accesses and modifications with getter and setter methods, respectively. For that, I need to be able to parse Dart programs.p  pIve been looking in the Dart documentation and online, but was unable to find anything useful, as all of my search results for dart parse programs and other similar queries have returned results about the parse methods for Numbers and URIs, and other unrelated stuff.

Negative 598 pI have a selfhosted WCF application where the service objects per call, single concurrency use embedded COM objects referenced from the class throughout the call built on a platform called Clarion. The COM instances are created and destroyed together with the service objects. However, underneath they access a singleton repository which takes long time to initialise very similar to this a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions1857705startupcodeforloadingcomobjectforwcfserviceStartup Code for Loading COM Object for WCF Servicea. So a first call is very long. Hence, I must call it on startup. p  pIf I dont instantiate the COM object on startup, everything is fine except for the long first call. But if I do, after the garbage collection the next request will crash with access violation exception when trying to access the COM. p  pThe service objects implement codeIDisposablecode where all the COM objects are nicely released using codeMarshal.ReleaseComObjectcode. The startup call also releases the COM object. p  pMy guess is that the startup COM gets somehow reused or recycled. I dont want it to Can I make sure it dies forever Or if its not possible, can I mark it not for garbage collection Obviously, codeGC.KeepAlivecode is irrelevant here, because these are different threads in different methods. p  pstrongMore detailsstrong the COM objects were made MTAcapable recently. They are threadsafe and fully concurrent, but before, when they were STA only, there was no such issue. Also, nothing bad happens outside of WCF when these guys run in separate threads. p

Negative 598 pRight now I am working on a website that is fluid, but I am having some problems with the JqueryJavascript. As of right now, once the user begins to scroll down the page, js fades the navigation bar in and changes the color of the text within the navigation bar. A dummy site with the link can be found at . However, once the browser is resized to 960px, I want the Jquery to disable because the effects that it provides are no longer needed. One of my professors at school said I should use window.length feature, but after looking it up and trying some things, I cant seem to figure it out.

Then the only difference I can think of for this DDL is that is loaded into the main memory, but I am confusedp  pCan anyone with knowledge to put my  may wrong  knowledge into correct order and to explain more this termsp  pThank youp

Negative 598 pFirstly, can I refer and change a class through javascript or does the element have to have a specific idp  pI have submittable form which is stacked next to a static div of text information. On successful submission, the form fades and displays a confirmation message in the place of the form. However, because this confirmation message is no where near as long in lengthheight as to what the form was, my left hand border on my static element overlaps others.p  pWhat I would like to do, is to just remove this border with the fade. In the JS I tried making the correct class a variable and then inline styling it. But it didnt seem to work.p  pAm I referring to it incorrectly it is commented out belowp  pIm think that another workaround may be to rename that class to something new after the fade, and then copy everything from the previous without the border in my css. But this seems quite extravagant for something that is probably fairly simple. p  pbr brp  pstrongEDITstrong I still am not really understanding it. Since this function is essentially checking for a cookie if the form has previously been completed, would the change in style be put onto when the cookie is made Also the style needs to be referred from my style.css file and not inline styling. Just to test, I have set the second style to change the border to another colour rather than disappearing it all together.p  pstrongEdit 2strong fixed what I wanted to do will update in the morning.p  pstrongHTMLstrongp  precodeltdiv classcontactussidegt ltpgtSome Textltpgt ltdivgt codepre  pstrongCSSstrongp  precode.contactusside   width 230px   float right   marginleft 0px    marginright 10px   paddingright 0px   paddingleft 15px  borderleft 1px solid eee   .contactusside2   width 230px   float right   marginleft 0px    marginright 10px   paddingright 0px   paddingleft 15px  borderleft 2px solid FFF000  .contactusside h2   borderbottom 1px solid 777   paddingbottom 4px  codepre  pstrongJSstrongp  precodefunction   var completed  .cookie completed , form  contactform, msg  contactf, sid  .contactusside  if  completed  undefined  ampamp  completed  done    form.hide msg.htmllth2 classgreengtSuccesslth2gtThankyou for submitting the form.

Im not able to use a redirectto I found a a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions13201351railsrenderjavascriptshowstextsimilar question herea because it only seems to send a certain content element back to the rootpath while elements like the navbar remain the same.

Negative 598 pI have some code that is slow 3060mins by last count, that I need to optimize, it is a data extraction script for Abaqus for a structural engineering model. The worst part of the script is the loop where it iterates through the object model database first by frame i.e. the time in the time history of the simulation and nested under this it iterates by each of the nodes. The silly thing is that there are 100k nodes but only about 20k useful nodes. But luckily for me the nodes are always in the same order, meaning I do not need to look up the nodes uniqueLabel, I can do this in a separate loop once and then filter what I get at the end. That is why I have dumped everything into one list and then I remove all the nodes that are repeats. But as you can see from the codep  precode    timeValues  []     peeqValues  []     for frame in frames 760 loops         setValues  frame.fieldOutputs[fieldOutputType].getSubset                     regionabaqusSet, positionELEMENTNODAL.values         timeValues.appendframe.frameValue         for value in setValues  100k loops             peeqValues.appendvalue.data codepre  pIt still needs to make the codevalue.datacode calls unnecessarily, about 80k times. If anyone is familiar with Abaqus odb object database objects, theyre super slow under python. To add insult to injury they only run in a single thread, under Abaqus which has its own python version 2.6.x and packages so e.g. numpy is available, pandas is not. Another thing that may be annoying is the fact that you can address the objects by position e.g. codeframes[1]code gives you the last frame, but you cannot slice, so e.g. you cant do this codefor frame in frames[010]  iterate first 10 elementscode.p  pI dont have any experience with itertools but Id want to provide it a list of nodeIDs or list of TrueFalse to map onto the setValues. The length and pattern of setValues to skip is always the same for each of the 760 frames. Maybe something likep  precode    for frame in frames still 760 calls         setValues  frame.fieldOutputs[fieldOutputType].getSubset                     regionabaqusSet, positionELEMENTNODAL.values         timeValues.appendframe.frameValue          nodeSetIDsTF  [True, True, False, False, False, ...] same length as                 setValues         filteredSetValues  ifilternodeSetIDsTF, setValues           for value in filteredSetValues  only 20k calls             peeqValues.appendvalue.data codepre  pAny other tips also appreciated, after this I did want to avoid the dots by removing the code.appendcode from the loop, and then putting the whole thing in a function to see if it helps. The whole script already runs in under 1.5 hours down from 6 and at one point 21 hours, but once you start optimizing there is no way to stop.p  pMemory considerations also appreciated, I run these on a cluster and I believe I got away once with 80 GB of RAM. The scripts definitely work on 160 GB, the issue is getting the resources allocated to me.p  pIve searched around for a solution but maybe Im using the wrong keywords, Im sure this is not an uncommon issue in looping.p  pstrongEDIT 1strongp  pHere is what I ended up usingp  precode     there is no compress under 2.6.x ... so use the equivalent recipe     from itertools import izip     def compressdata, selectors          compressABCDEF, [1,0,1,0,1,1] gt ACEF         return d for d, s in izipdata, selectors if s     def iterateOdbframes, selectors  minor speed up         peeqValues  []         timeValues  []         append  peeqValues.append  minor speed up         for frame in frames             setValues  frame.fieldOutputs[fieldOutputType].getSubset             regionabaqusSet, positionELEMENTNODAL.values             timeValues.appendframe.frameValue             for value in compresssetValues, selectors  massive speed up                 appendvalue.data         return peeqValues, timeValues      peeqValues, timeValues  iterateOdbframes, selectors codepre  pThe biggest improvement came from using the codecompressvalues, selectorscode method the whole script, including the odb portion went from 130 hours to 25mins.

Negative 598 pI am making a game in Cocos2D Version 3.1 using spriteBuilder. I am creating my animation by add the list of frames into an array and storing it in the cache. When I need to run the animation, I get it from the cache and play it on the screen. This works great for my running animation. I have another animation in which my character is sliding. When I play my sliding animation after my running animation, my character appears to be sliding in midair, not intersecting the ground. The reason for this is probably because the frames are loaded immeadately after the running animation, so they are loaded in the same place as the running animation. Since the frames of the sliding animation are smaller than the running animation, it makes it seem like the player is floating. p  pI would like to know if there is any way I can make the frames load a bit lower, so that they are touching the ground. Is the only way to do this to push the position of the hero down when the slide animation is loaded, and then back up when I want to load the run animationp  pThanks p

Negative 598 pI have a HTML5 canvas that fills the screen and looks like this img srchttpi.stack.imgur.comsMQ7O.png altCanvasp  pIn this state it is fully zoomed out, but I allow the user zoom in and pan around like in google maps.  Every time the viewport changes, I redraw everything that is visible inside the viewport to the canvas.  So as you zoom in less things need to be drawn.  p  pRight now zooming and panning comes with a lot of lag, because each redraw takes 30 milliseconds.  When profiling in google chrome, the majority of the time comes from the codecontext.fillcode for drawing a coloured circle and codecontext.drawImagecode for drawing a glossy transparent overlay on the circles.p  pSo my rendering is very inefficient, but since the draws only happen when the viewport bounds change, its not like I have the option to only redraw a small portion of the screen at a time.p  pDoes anyone know another way I can optimize this  p  pOne idea I was wondering about was to draw the entire thing onto an invisible canvas, and only copy over the viewport bounds to the main canvas.  But the invisible canvas would be 2000x2000 pixels.  So I am unsure if this would be a good idea.p

The number of lines to be processed will vary from job to job.

And the user should also be able to go back to previous state by clicking a back button.p  pevents should appear as circles depending on the number i.e density of events that took place on a particular time or date. and if a user clicks on the event he should be able to go to the specific time in recorded video when the event took place.p  pNow my questions arep  p1 Is using WPF to create such control alright or should i use winforms. As i need this control to integrate in winform application.p  p2 How do i go in designing and programming such control. I mean can someone provide a class diagram or flow chart for this. How do i place the events in correct positions.p  p3 how do i get the data stored in the database in this control as it is being read and written from the winform application.p  p4 And if possible can someone tell me what contols and logic should i use for the particular parts of this control.p

Negative 598 pWith a linq query I retrieve a list from the database. The list contains 2 items of a specific class containing the property RoleType. the type of RoleType is an int. p  pthe first object has a property value 0. the second object has a property value 1.p  pI also got an enump  precodeenum RoleTypes      Type1  1,     Type2  0,  codepre  pThe weird order of indexing the enums is a given, I cant change that.p  pMy business rules states that there has to be exactly one role with RoleType value Type2 and at least one role with RoleType value Type1. This is the code I use for thatp  precodevar ExactlyOneRoleType2  roles.Countrole gt role.RoleType  intRoleTypes.Type2  1 var AtLeastOneRoleType1  roles.Anyrole gt role.RoleType  intRoleTypes.Type1 codepre  pAccording to the list I mentioned earlier, both variables ExactlyOneRoleType2 and AtLeastOneRoleType1 should be true. At least, I would expect that. Only if I debug through the code I found out that ExactlyOneRoleType2 is false. After some research I find out that p  precoderoles.Countrole gt role.RoleType  intRoleTypes.Type2 codepre  preturns 2 instead of 1 which I find odd because there is only 1 role with RoleType Type2. Why does the count return 2 It also doesnt compute with the fact that the Any call actually returns true. How can list containing 2 items have both 2 items with RoleType Type2 and have at least one item with RoleType Type1p  pAlso when I change the count call top  precoderoles.Countrole gt role.RoleType  0 codepre  pit still returns 2. Only when I change the Count call to thisp  precodeprivate static bool IsRoleTypeType2Role role      return role.RoleType  intRoleTypes.Type2   roles.CountIsRoleTypeType2 codepre  pthe count returns 1 as it should be.p  pWhat is happening here Why does the count return 2 when I use a anonymous predicate Did I misunderstood something about how the predicate works in case of count Or is this is bug in Linqp
Negative 598 pSo, Im reading Ian Abramsons Beginners guide to Oracle Database 10g coming from using mysql, and it mentions PLSQL and gives all these great reasons to use it, however Im doing this in preparation for a rewrite of several applications my company uses.p  pMy head programmer argues that if PLSQL is no more efficient at database access, all parsing and queries should be done on client side programs to spread the load out from the Oracle server. I argue that we should compartmentalize our code and attempt to avoid code duplication, and PLSQL may help us do that.p  pThe problem is, we dont actually know And this book doesnt tell us, how efficient database access is in PLSQL over an application running on a different machine that makes 35 largish queries per operation. I would think its more likely to run faster because to my knowlege plsql functions store and save their execution plans, and the traditional network overhead would be cut by a factor of 35 depending on the number of queriesp

Negative 598 pIm writing a web application that must be multitenant. Im using JPA for the persistence layer and Im evaluating EclipseLink with interest.p  pThe multitenant strategy I want to use is one schema per customer. Hibernate supports such a strategy a hrefhttpdocs.jboss.orghibernateorm4.2devguideenUShtmlch16.htmld5e4771 relnofollowhttpdocs.jboss.orghibernateorm4.2devguideenUShtmlch16.htmld5e4771a and Ive already used it with success. However, AFAIK it supports it only when using the native Hibernate API, while I want to use JPA.p  pEclipseLink, on the other hand, supports singletable and multitable multitenancy strategies. However, it also supports partitioning and with a simple custom partitioning policy I may easily set up one partition for each customer.p  pThe first question might be whether using partitioning for this use case is appropriate or not.p  pThe main problem, however, is that the customer base may hopefully grow over time, so I have to make EclipseLink know about new customers dynamically i.e. without restarting the webapp. From what I understand, to set up partitioning in EclipseLink I have to setup my persistence unit with different connection pools or nodes every node has its configured datasource and a name. On the other hand, the partitioning strategy will determine the node to use by its name. So far so good, but I plan to setup my persistence unit using Springs codeLocalContainerEntityManagerFactoryBeancode. I may discover customers dynamically on startup, when the codeLocalContainerEntityManagerFactoryBeancode is processed, so that I can pass all the needed properties for all the nodescustomers by that time, but what happens if a new customer is added afterwards I dont think that changing persistence unit properties dynamically will have any effect on the already constructed codeEntityManagerFactorycode singleton instance... and I fear EclipseLink will complain if I request a partition for which no corresponding node was known at the codeEntityManagerFactorycode creation time. Correct me if Im wrong.p  pI think that declaring the codeLocalContainerEntityManagerFactoryBeancode scope as prototype bean would be a very bad idea and I think it wont work at all. On the other hand, since a customer interaction is bound to a specific HTTP session, I may alternatively use a middle approach by declaring the codeLocalContainerEntityManagerFactoryBeancode scope as session, but I think that in this case I would have to manage problems like increased memory consumption and shared cache coordination between multiple codeEntityManagerFactoriescode one for each customer that is using the application at a given time.p  pIf I cant make this strategy work, I think Ill have to abandon partitioning as a whole and fall back to a dynamic data source routing approach, but in this case Im concerned about the EclipseLink shared cache consistency I think Ill have to disable it completely and this would be a real disadvantage.p  pThanks in advance for any feedback on this.p

I know the expressions themselves are accurate because the transfrom works fine when I enter them directly into the XSLT without PHP.p  pFrom what I understand, the problem is that the parameter is being passed as a string rather than as a proper XPath expression, and so the XSLT cannot resolve codeselectcode to a nodeset. So how do I prevent that Its important to pass a whole XPath expression so that I can change the foreach criteria to whatever I want.p

Negative 598 pIts come up recently at my job that the SEO guys for our customer are unhappy with the src attribute values being generated in our img tags on their CQAEMbased website. I know nexttonothing about SEO, so I wont pretend to understand, but it seems they have a point. Were not using the outofthebox image component per se, but the behavior is the same.p  pThe src attribute of the img tags gets the path of the image node, with the img selector and some other stuff appended to it. This of course causes the request to a hrefhttpdocs.adobe.comdocsencqcurrentdevelopingmobileresponsive.htmlUnderstanding20Image20Rendering20in20AEM relnofollowgo through the image servleta, which is then responsible for drawing the image. If I understand correctly, its done this way to support things like the cropresizeetc tools available in the html5smartimage widget. The servlet applies these edits to the image and renders the altered image.p  pThe complaint is that the actual file name for the images are nowhere to be seen in that src attribute. Im operating on the assumption that this is a valid complaint, but I really dont know if it is. Im likely going to be asked to jump through hoops to change this behavior so the src attribute references the image by its direct path in the DAM.p  pAre these valid complaints If the complaints are valid, why would the image component work this way Should the titlealt values be considered sufficient for SEO purposes If my customer is not using the extra features from html5smartimage, is there any other reason why I should not just address the images by their explicit DAM path Ive already worked out what I think is the best solution, but Id like to be armed with more information before taking that plunge.p

Negative 598 pA friend and I are trying to implement a python plugin service for one of our C applications. Ideally we would like for the plugins to run in their own thread. So far we have a plugin class that the user implements, a running plugin is just an instance of the user implemented class. We need the running plugin instances to be able receive messages from another thread. p  pWe have what almost appears to be a working solution but are running into issues with the GIL. Does anyone have any suggestions for how to go about implementing thisp  pThanksp
Negative 598 pI have a cube with two dates  codeDate of Birthcode and codeDate of Purchasecode. I would like to create a strongcalculated memberstrong which produces the codeage in yearscode based on these two dates. I can already do this in the dataset once the query has been run however I would like to include all empty values as I have a layout based on showing all the blanks as well as the used values. p  pCan someone give me an example of how to calculate this in MDX as running with the two date sets currently causes memory issues. p
Negative 598 pFinished watching thoughtprovoking video Composable application architecture with reasonably priced monads from Rnar Bjarnason, I started to write the examples provided in the video in Scalaz. I am having a little surprise when implementing the writer based interpreter for the Interact App. Here is the code,p  precodesealed trait Interact[A]  case class Askprompt String extends Interact[String]  case class Tellmsg String extends Interact[Unit]  type W[A]  scalaz.Writer[Vector[String], A]  object ConsoleW extends Interact gt W    def apply[A]i Interact[A]  i match      case Askprompt gt       printlnprompt       WriterVectorprompt, readLine     case Tellmsg gt       printlnmsg       WriterVector.empty,      codepre  pWhen I tried to lift ConsoleW into an interpreter for the interact free monad, the compiler hinted me lack of context bound of Functor to W. I am quite surprised since Writer itself is a monad, the functor context bound should be given for free. Ok so I had to explicitly write a functor,p  precodeimplicit val functor  new Functor[W]    def map[A, B]fa Writer[Vector[String], A]f A gt B      fa.mapf  codepre  pwhich is pretty dumb... since I basically did nothing other than calling the map method of Writer itself. Now I can lift ConsoleW into an interpreter. However when I tried to foldMap the interact program with ConsoleW, the compiler again hinted the lack of Monad context bound for W Ok, this is totally unexpected, let me spoonfeed you, Scalac...p  precodeval prg Free[type f[x]  Coyoneda[Interact, x]f, Unit]    import scalaz.std.vector.  implicit val monad  new scalaz.Monad[W]    def point[A]a gt A  Writer[Vector[String], A]Vector.empty, a   def bind[A, B]fa Writer[Vector[String], A]f A gt Writer[Vector[String], B]       fa.flatMapf   prg.foldMapCoyoneda.liftTFConsoleW codepre  pNow everything compiles, and the Writer Monad can record all the prompts into vector when the program runs. But this is unsatifying, I would like to create an interpreter with Writer as the underlying Monad without having to explicitly providing the proof that it is really a Functor and Monad. Any idea how this could work outp

Negative 598 pI will try to be as succinct as possible. Well, I am given a project whose AIM isp  ol liAccess Sqlite3 Database by using C.li liMake a class having member functions for executing different types of SQLite queries.li liOnce the above is done, make a List container using STL in main and get each record stored as separate object in the list. So that, when a user tries to access the records of database with predefined SQLite queries, he will access the List container only and not the database.li liOnce the above is done in mainfunction, transfer all this code to one of the class member function. And call this particular function in main, getting the exact output that we will get from AIM3li ol  pSo, working on this I created a Database foreignkey.db located in DBsqlite folder PATHDBsqlite3foreignkey.db.p  pNOTE The strongschemastrong of strongempinfostrong is as followsp  precode  CREATE TABLE empinfo   SRNO INT ,   NAME CHAR32 NOT NULL,   AGE INT4 NOT NULL CHECKAGE gt 16,   SEX CHAR 6 NOT NULL,   ADDRESS CHAR70,   EMPID INT NOT NULL CHECKEMPIDgt300 UNIQUE,   CARDID TEXT NOT NULL UNIQUE,   SALARY INT CHECKSALARYgt10000 NOT NULL,   MOBILENO INT16 UNIQUE,   EMAILID TEXT32 UNIQUE,   BDT INT,   PHOTO BLOB  codepre  pThe entries in the strongempinfostrong table are as followsI have deleted some columns to make it look betterp  precode SRNO  NAME AGE  SEX   ADDRESS    EMPID  CARDID    SALARY       1     AAA  35  MALE   A1A2A3A4   301    1111AAA   11111       2     BBB  36  FEMALE B1B2B3B4   302    2222BBB   22222       3     CCC  37  FEMALE C1C2C3C4   303    3333CCC   33333       4     DDD  38  MALE   D1D2D3D4   304    4444DDD   44444       5     EEE  39  MALE   E1E2E3E4   305    5555EEE   55555       6     FFF  40  MALE   F1F2F3F4   306    6666FFF   66666       7     GGG  41  MALE   G1G2G3G4   307    7777GGG   77777       8     HHH  42  FEMALE H1H2H3H4   308    8888HHH   88888       9     III  43  FEMALE I1I2I3I4   309    9999IIII  99999 codepre  pI made the following program in C to achieve AIM1 and AIM2.

Negative 598 pI am planning on using TCPIP and UDP protocols emtogetherem for my game server. I have alread setup the server, in java, and the client, in c, and had them both connected with a nice gui using the TCPIP protocol. I need their to be UDP interactions since the UDP protocol allows the loss of packets which is essential for an online game that has position and other updates being transferred that wouldnt be beneficial to resend if an error occurs. My problem occurred when I tried converting my client and server to the UDP protocol. In java I have noticed that it will be harder to create a UDP connection because it isnt as easy as binding to a port and awaiting connections IMHO sop  ul lipIs it possible via the UDP protocol, or any other protocol, to have my server embroadcastem data, such as entity location, and allow the client to receive the data without having to pragmatically establish a permanent connection to that server.pli lipIf the above is a no, is it possible to use the UDP and TCPIP protocols together without having to establish two separate connection.pli ul

Negative 598 pI am wanting to implement functionality similar to the Fandango and Starbucks apps where the user gets a notification in an inbox. Ideally, if the user opens the app from the notification, it would go to the appropriate view in the app. For example, if the notification is a benefit update, and the user taps the notification, the benefits view would open.p  pIf the app is opened by tapping the app icon and not by selecting the notification, I want the notification info to be shown in a table view. Im guessing I could just save the notification payload dictionary to an array and use that to populate the table view. I would also want to badge the inbox in the app and the app icon with the number of notifications in the array.p  pIm just not sure how to go about doing this type of functionality. p

Negative 598 pI have created a site where I have embedded several tables from data.Iowa.gov in a tabbed navigation format. This is contained within a codeltdivgtcode.p  pThe embedded tables work in Chrome perfectly. In IE 9 they dont load right away you have to click around and then they load. In Firefox 35 only the first tabembedded table loads. The framework appears complete with the tools that normally accompany the tables other views, print, etc but the expected tables do not.p

Negative 598 pIn one of my ViewControllers, I have codeaddStatuscode, which is pasted below, in my codeviewDidLoadcode. I expect the codelineWidthcode of this circle to animate, but it doesnt seem to be doing so. In my search for why this might be, I found this part of Apples documentation on a hrefhttpsdeveloper.apple.comlibraryiosdocumentationCocoaConceptualCoreAnimationguideCreatingBasicAnimationsCreatingBasicAnimations.html relnofollowAnimating Layer Contenta. The part that I thought to be important noted herep  blockquote   pIf you want to use Core Animation classes to initiate animations, you must issue all of your Core Animation calls from inside a viewbased animation block. The UIView class disables layer animations by default but reenables them inside animation blocks. So any changes you make outside of an animation block are not animated. Listing 35 shows an example of how to change a layers opacity implicitly and its position explicitly. In this example, the myNewPosition variable is calculated beforehand and captured by the block. Both animations start at the same time but the opacity animation runs with the default timing while the position animation runs with the timing specified in its animation object.p blockquote  pWhen I looked up why this might not be animating, I read this piece and assumed that it meant I should place my CAAnimation inside of a UIView animation block. This function worked fine in a blank application without the animation block when placed in the coderootViewControllercode, but does not seem to animate when in my secondary codeviewControllercode in this app. Any tips would be wonderfully helpful.

It retrieves messages, does certain things with them, and submits them to another system like f.e. codeRiemanncode or codeStatsdcode.p  pRight now the communication with codeRabbitMQcode uses the async codeSelectConnectioncode adapter, the communication with the output codeRiemanncodecodeStatsdcode uses the codepythonriemanncodecodepystatsdcode client which are blocking. p  pI believe I could improve the overall performance of this utility by modifying the codepythonriemanncode and codepystatsdcode client to also use an async adapter Id have to write that one, but my problem is that Im not sure how to combine that with pikas codeIOLoopcode.p  pAccording to my understanding I think I would probably have to find a way to add event listeners on the pika codeIOLoopcode which should trigger when codeRiemanncode or codeStatsdcode responds, because according to my current understanding there is no good way how I could have two event loops, unless I multithread the utility and have one codeIOLoopcode for the connection to codeRabbitMQcode in thread code1code and another one responsible for the output codeRiemanncodecodeStatsdcode in thread code2code.p  pSo my question is Whats the best thing to do, multi thread this utility and have one codeIOLoopcode per external system Im interacting with, or trying to find a way to also use pikas codeIOLoopcode for a purpose that it has probably not been intended for.p

Negative 598 pIm now doing a smart coffee maker for a school project, but Im running into some troubles while making the phone app.p  pAs I didnt have any experience in making apps for Android and not the time to learn it I used the framework Cordova to make it. I put a Raspberry PI connected to the coffee maker, which is connected to a local wireless network.p  pWhen I open my app, I want to be able to check if the coffee maker is online, so I ping raspberrypi.local with a simple JSON request and check if it returns me anything. If not, it goes in discovering mode and try to scan for the RPI which is in hotspot mode if it cant reach a wireless network on boot.p  pBut I cant ping raspberrypi.local, only its local IP due to Androids limitations I understood no ZeroConf or something like that implemented in, which is quite uneasy as it has a randomly given IP via DHCP. And I cant give the RPI a static IP cause I cant know the range allowed by the router.p  pSo is there a way with Cordova  Phonegap to reach a local hostname or to ping the network for a special port open or something like thatp

Negative 598 pI have a C MVC application with a WCF service running on Azure. First of it was of course hosted on the free version, but as I had that one running smoothly I wanted to try and see how it ran on either Basic or Standard, which as far as I know should be dedicated servers. p  pTo my surprise the code ran significantly slower once it was changed from Free to either Standard or Basic. I chose the smallest instance, but still expected them to perform better than the Free optionp  pFrom my performance logging I can see that the code that runs especially slow is something that is started as async from Task.Run. Initially it was old school Thread.Start but considered whether this might spawn it in some lower priority thread and therefore changed it to Task.Run  without this changing anything  so perhaps it has nothing to do with it  but it might, so now you know.p  pThe code that runs really slow basically works on some XML document, through XDocument, XElement etc. It loops through, has some LINQ etc. but nothing too fancy. But still it is 510 times slower on Basic and Standard as on the Free version For the exact same request the Free version uses around 1000ms where as Basic and Standard uses 800010000msp  pIn each test I have tried 510 times but without any decrease in responsetimes. I thought about whether I need to wait some hours before the BasicStandard is fully functional or something like that, but each time I switch back, the Free version just outperforms it from the getgo.p  pAny suggestions Is the Free version for some strange reason more powerful than Basic or Standard or do I need to configure something differently once I get up and running on Basic or Standardp

Negative 598 pFirstly, my apologies if this answer is already on here, as Ive been searching for a few weeks and havent found anything yet.p  pI am working on an Android app which needs to allow the user to create and remove buttons. I know how to normally create buttons statically through adding the button the XML file and creating its functionality in the JAVA file.p  pInstead, I have a static button which Ill refer to as Create Button. When the user presses on the Create Button, they should be given the option to add a new button to the current activity, allowing them to change the title of said button etc. When they close the app and open it back up the button they added should still be there. Similarly, they should be given an option to remove buttons.p  pCan someone point me in the right direction Most of the sources that Ive come across only explain how to statically create buttons, like I first mentioned. p  pThanks for the helpp  pEDIT I was able to figure some stuff out based off of the feedback Ive been given. p  pSo far I have the following code in the onOptionsItemSelected  methodp  precode    if id  R.id.addbutton                   Button myButton  new Buttonthis         myButton.setTextPush Me         myButton.setVisibilityView.VISIBLE         return true              codepre  pI am still a little confused about how this can get added to the layout.

Negative 598 pI ma developing an app with SteroidsSupersonic using Parse as backend and I am struggling to make object relationships work. Here an example. I have one class Course and one class Teacher with a one to one relationship each Course one Teacher. What I would like to do is to display all the courses with the associated teacher. To set up the relationship in Parse I have used a column type Pointer to the other class. Below the code in the controllerp  precodeCourse.findAll.then function courses          scope.apply function             scope.courses courses            for i  0 i lt scope.courses.length i             look for the teacher          Teacher.findscope.courses[i].Teacher.objectId.then function teacher              scope.apply function                 scope.courses[i].Teacher teacher                                                        codepre  pThe problem of the above code is that the variable i is not defined inside the Teacher.find function so I cannot assign the teacher object to the correct course object. I even tried to use a specific variable in the scope to manage the index as in this other codep  precodeCourse.findAll.then function courses          scope.apply function             scope.courses courses           scope.index  0           for i  0 i lt scope.courses.length i             look for the teacher          Teacher.findscope.courses[i].Teacher.objectId.then function teacher              scope.apply function                 scope.courses[scope.index].Teacher teacher               scope.index  scope.index  1                                                        codepre  pThe problem of this second code is that randomly a teacher is linked to the wrong course maybe because the function find is called asynchronous so the two variables i and index are not always synchronized.p  pI believe the problem I am facing is more related to the asynchronous behavior of angularjs but I dont really know how to solve it.

Negative 598 pI just cant seem to understand how crypto api works.

From here I am setting up my transform to use aes algorithm. Then I set a hardcoded key of length 16. Then I set up a scatter list from the buffer from userspace. Then when I encrypt sg, at this point shouldnt tmp be encryptedp  pWhen I read later I still get the original string without encryption. What am I doing wrong  Thank you.p

Negative 598 pIm not sure watermark is the correct terms here, but what I want to do is the following.p  pI want to display a UIViewController there is also a UITabBar on screen. Im going for a certain look with this UIViewController. I want the entire ViewController to display an image. Then, I want overlay a color overtop of this image with say 80 alpha i.e transparency. So you see the image faintly in the background.p  pThen I want to add some UILabels, UITextFields, and more UIImageViews.p  pI have a couple of questions.p  p1 What size image do I need This application is portrait only. I notice Apples HIG states that an iPhone 6 screen size is 1242 x 2208. Does that mean I should have my designer present me with an image that is 1242x2208 to create this UIViewController I want What about the UITabBar and status bar that are on screen. Will those shrink and skew the imagep  p2 If I get the image in iPhone 6 size, do I scale it down for the other models 6, 5, 4s Or do I just create a UIImageView, constrain it to all sides, and then tell it to respect aspect ratiop  p3 Do I need this image in question in 4 sizes, specifically for 4s, 5, 6, and 6. Or do I just get a big image and let it scale itself Does it need to even be 1242x2208p  p3a Can it be biggerp  p3b Should I avoid going smaller, so it never scales up and looks weirdp  p3c Does my image need to be created in a 916 ratio, like 1242x2208 isp

Negative 598 pLet me try and clarify my intentions.p  pIm developing an app that accesses to the Android contacts provider. I have already implemented a mechanism for pulling contacts from the contacts provider and storing the results in an SQLite table. Currently, when I query for the results of a contacts ID, I can retrieve all the data for that contact, phone numbers, email addresses, etc.p  pHowever, in order to specify which of those my app should use on future occasions, I have to store the resulting contact data e.g. CommonDataKinds.Phone.NUMBER, CommonDataKinds.Phone.TYPE etc in the SQL table.p  pThis presents a problem if the data in the Android contacts provider has changed. One solution I have considered is to requery the ID and store the data that has changed. However, implementing such a solution requires gathering all data for that contact, making it difficult to determine the correct contact data to use.p  pMy question is thusp  pIs there a unique record key used in the Android Providers contact data, in the same way as there is in the Providers contact entry itself A phone number or email address equivalent of Contact.IDp  pFailing that, does the Android contacts provider store the last modified date and time Im hoping that if I cant reference the contact data in the provider, I can at least run a check to see if anything has changed since the contact was selected for use in the app, allowing my app to alert the user that the data has changed.p

Negative 598 pWe have a gradle project that contains 4 modules 1 library module and 3 android apps. To build our apps we use strongcircleCIstrong. We have also disabled predexing for the circleCI builds following a hrefhttptools.android.comtechdocsnewbuildsystemtips relnofollowthisa guide.p  pEverything was great until I added strongInstabugstrong to one of our projects. We have been reaching the circleCI 4GB limit ever since. On top of that, the project that has Instabug as a dependency will start the codepreDexcode gradle task, no matter what. To start a new build, we use the following command code.gradlew assembleDebug PpreDexEnablefalsecode. p  pThe project that uses Instabug gets some warnings during build time like this p  blockquote   pIgnoring InnerClasses attribute for an anonymous inner class   com.instabug.library.b that doesnt come with an   associated EnclosingMethod attribute. This class was probably produced by a   compiler that did not target the modern .class file format. The recommended   solution is to recompile the class from source, using an uptodate compiler   and without specifying any target type options. The consequence of ignoring   this warning is that reflective operations on this class will incorrectly   indicate that it is emnotem an inner class.p blockquote  pI assume that we are reaching the 4

Negative 598 pI am working on an existing web application that uses Rails 3 and Devise.  My task at the moment is to add a JSON API to the application.  I have created a MobileSessionsController lt DeviseSessionsController that implements create with a dataonly response.  p  pThe issue is in the routing.  Right now, the relevant parts of routes.rb are as followsp  precode  For the web app   devisefor users, controllers gt sessions gt sessions,                                       registrations gt registrations   as user do     get login gt devisesessionsnew     get logout gt devisesessionsdestroy, as gt logout     post signup gt registrationssignup, as gt signup   end    And for the API, later on   namespace api do     namespace user do       devisefor users, controllers gt sessions gt mobilesessions,                  skip all       devisescope user do         post login gt mobilesessionscreate       end ... codepre  pThe data endpoint is at apiuserlogin.  rake routes lists the followingp  precodeapiuserlogin POST apiuserlogin.format apiusermobilesessionscreate codepre  pIn my spec, theres the followingp  precodedescribe MobileSessionsController do   renderviews   describe create do     context for some condition do       letparams do                     basic params                end       before do         post create, params.mergeformat json       end        it should render a json response do         expectresponse.headers[ContentType].to eq applicationjson charsetutf8       end ... codepre  pWhen I run the spec, it gives the following errorp  precodeAbstractControllerActionNotFound Could not find devise mapping for path mobilesessionscreate.jsonparamsblah. This may happen for two reasons  1 You forgot to wrap your route inside the scope block. For example    devisescope user do     get someroute gt somedevisecontroller   end  2 You are testing a Devise controller bypassing the router.    If so, you can explicitly tell Devise which mapping to use     request.env[devise.mapping]  Devise.mappings[user] codepre  pIve tried many different configurations within the second devisefor block modules, whether or not to use skip all, removing the second devisefor entirely, putting it at different levels of the namespace and I cant shake this error.  My guess is that the second option there the devise.mapping bit is not the solution as it seems like its not supposed to be bypassing the router at all.  And since I have the route in empreciselyem the sort of block it suggests for the first option, Im befuddled as to how to fix this thing.  How can I get this thing workingp  pAppreciate the helpp

Negative 598 pOk so lets say we have 3 text files named codehenry.txtcode  codeadam.txtcode  codejosh.txtcodep  pWe want to open these text files, read the contents and store the integers contained in the text files into an array.p  pSo for example codehenry.txtcode contains the integers code100, 200, 300, 400, 500code all on a different line.p  pNow as for taking input from the user, lets say the user types codeStart Henrycodep  pThis would read the text file and store the integers on each line into an array.p  pThen the user could type codeSelect kcode, which would print out the kth item in the array. Or the user could type codeSelect maxcode which would print the last element in the array.p  pLastly the user types codeEnd henrycode This closes the file and frees any dynamically allocated memory.p  pI already know how to write the code for taking the integers in the text files and storing them into an array and so forth.p  pWhat I am confused on is how I would implement things such as codeStart henrycode codeSelect kcode and codeEnd henrycode.p  pFor codeStart henrycode I tried using codestdstringfindcode to check if the word Start was contained in the string that stores input from the user. If Start is found then it calls the function codeStartcode. From here it again checks if a word such as henry, josh, or adam is contained within the input the user entered. If one of the words is found then it opens the text file associated with the name and stores the integers into an array.p  pNow I dont know if there is a better way to do this, but if there is please explain it to me.p  pMy real problem here is when the user enters codeSelect kcode. I tried implementing the same method I did with codeStartcode but I have no clue as to how I would check if a certain element in the array was entered, or if codemaxcode was entered instead.p

Negative 598 pI am trying to request an image from a URL using the HTTP module, and then send the contents of the response directly as the response given by my ExpressJS app without writing the image request response to disk first.

Can I just not use layoutweight effectively with rotationp

Of course, I can iterate through, but I am looking for more of a oneliner to do this.p  pEDIT So the answer should look something like thisp  precode1 gt [ [0,0,3,4,5],        [0,1,5,0,0]] 3 gt [ [0,0,9,0,0]] 5 gt [ [0,0,2,2,2],        [0,1,3,0,0],        [1,0,0,4,0]] codepre
