This means that things and content i posted on the social media will no longer point to the right place meaning that the user will experiance a 404 not found when attempting to view these pages.p  pOfcourse i could write a codeRewriteRulecode for every page i have but there are over 1000 different pages and that seems like a very huge task.p  pSo my question is is there a way to avoid writing 1000 codeRewriteRulescode or am i bound to do slave workp  precodehttplearningbank.dkaboutusattachmentforside httplearningbank.dkaboutusattachmentlbcickrlenfinal httplearningbank.dkaboutusattachmentlearningcircle httplearningbank.dkcategorycarrier httplearningbank.dkcategoryressourcer httplearningbank.dkcategorysupport httplearningbank.dkcategoryuncategorized httplearningbank.dkelaeringogtests httplearningbank.dkelaeringoguddannelsessystem httplearningbank.dkelaeringsomcloudlosning httplearningbank.dkelaeringsomcloudlosningelaeringsomcloudlosning httplearningbank.dkenterprise httplearningbank.dkfeatures httplearningbank.dkfeaturesattachmentakademiteam httplearningbank.dkfeaturesattachmentelaeringtests httplearningbank.dkfeaturesattachmentjeopardy httplearningbank.dkfeaturesattachmentwatch httplearningbank.dkhelp httplearningbank.dkjobogkarriere httplearningbank.dkkontaktos httplearningbank.dkkontaktosattachmentgooglemaps httplearningbank.dkomosattachmentavatar httplearningbank.dkomosattachmentimg6169 httplearningbank.dkomosattachmentlskvadrat httplearningbank.dkomosattachmentron httplearningbank.dkomosattachmentulcloud httplearningbank.dkportfoliocategoryvideo2 httplearningbank.dkpris httplearningbank.dkressourcer httplearningbank.dkressourcer10princripperforatfasuccesmedelaering httplearningbank.dkressourcer2minvideointroduktion httplearningbank.dkressourcer4tingduskalvideforatmotiveredinemedarbejdere httplearningbank.dkressourcerbenchmarkingbasics httplearningbank.dkressourcercasenaturerhvervstyrelsen httplearningbank.dkressourcercasenaturerhvervstyrelsenattachmentbenchmarking httplearningbank.dkressourcercasenaturerhvervstyrelsenattachmentnaturerhvervcase httplearningbank.dkressourcererdudennyesalesmanagertillearningbankasdanmark httplearningbank.dkressourcerguidenedbringdinaht httplearningbank.dkressourcerguidenedbringdinahtattachmentaveragehandlingtime httplearningbank.dkressourcerguidenedbringdinahtattachmentnedbringdinaht httplearningbank.dkressourcerlearningbankbook httplearningbank.dkressourcerlearningbankbookattachmentbookopen httplearningbank.dkressourcerlearningbankbookattachmentlearningbankbook httplearningbank.dkressourcerlearningbankpraesentation httplearningbank.dkressourcerlearningbankpraesentationattachmentpresentation httplearningbank.dkressourcerlmsvslcms httplearningbank.dkressourcerlmsvslcmsattachmentlcms httplearningbank.dkressourcermichaelcomvalius httplearningbank.dkressourcermichaelcomvaliusattachmentmichael httplearningbank.dkressourcermichaelcomvaliusattachmentthomas httplearningbank.dkressourcerpage2 httplearningbank.dkressourcersoftwareengineer httplearningbank.dkressourcerthelifeinlearningbank httplearningbank.dkressourcerthelifeinlearningbankattachmentside1new httplearningbank.dkressourcerthelifeinlearningbankattachmentside1newfeature httplearningbank.dkressourcerthomashansen httplearningbank.dkressourcervildutagesseriostsabliverdunodttilatmale httplearningbank.dkressourcervildutagesseriostsabliverdunodttilatmaleattachmentblogvildutagesseriost httplearningbank.dkressourcervildutagesseriostsabliverdunodttilatmaleattachmentmusfoto httplearningbank.dkressourcerwebudviklertilfremtidenskompetencesystem httplearningbank.dkressourcerwhitepapernlpdetnyesort httplearningbank.dkressourcerwhitepapernlpdetnyesortattachmentnlpdetnyesort httplearningbank.dksupport httplearningbank.dksupportattachmentdownload httplearningbank.dksupporterminedatasikret httplearningbank.dksupporthvordanbestillerjeg httplearningbank.dksupporthvorlangtidtagerdetatkommeigang httplearningbank.dksupportkanjegfaminedataindilearningbank httplearningbank.dksupportkanjegseendemoindenjegkober httplearningbank.dksupportkanjegsletteminkonto httplearningbank.dktestimonialsjohnrisorhansenmarketingmananger httplearningbank.dktestimonialsolafdebackerdeveloper httplearningbank.dkuncategorizedelaeringuddannelsessystemer httplearningbank.dkuncategorizedhvordanvilduudvikledanmarksmestspaendendeplatformtillaeringogorganisationsudvikling httplearningbank.dkwpcontentuploads201409Learningbankaugust.pdf codepre

Positive 365 pI created a small utility code in JAVA that reads a webpage using buffered reader and parse selective content from it. The source code and other details are present a hrefhttpsgithub.comaj95StalkerSPOJ relnofollowherea. The tool works fine but from past some time, the code is not working. I tried debugging the code but Ive noticed that the code is unable to read the web page source using simple buffered reader anymore like it used to. I am specifically reading the URLs www[dot]spoj[dot]comstatus[username]signedlist. An example of such a url is a hrefhttpwww.spoj.comstatusaj95signedlist relnofollowthis.a Here, [username] are different usernames. I used the below code to check if I am able to read webage source.p  precodeimport java.io.BufferedReader import java.io.IOException import java.io.InputStream import java.io.InputStreamReader import java.net.URL import java.net.URLConnection  class MyClass   public static void mainString[] args throws IOException      try          String MyUrl  httpwww.spoj.comstatusaj95signedlist         URL url  new URLMyUrl         URLConnection con  url.openConnection         InputStream inputstream  con.getInputStream         BufferedReader br  new BufferedReadernew InputStreamReaderinputstream         String line  null         int lineread  0          while line  br.readLine  null              lineread                    System.out.printlnlineread      catch Exception e          System.out.printfn Oops Something went wrongnn        codepre  pThe code gives the codeoutput  0code meaning I am unable to read the source unlike I used to earlier. What can be possible reason  Is it possible that there is some change in the webpage security that is not allowing buffered reader to work. Is there any other way to do the same task as the buffered reader is expected to do i.e reading the webpage source. I tried reading using Scanner but to no avail. I cannot change the basic logic of my utility code, so please suggest a replacement for reading the url source.p

Positive 365 pHow can I react to just the URLs hash changing with Iron Routerp  pIve reimplemented the codeactioncode method in a custom a hrefhttpironmeteor.github.ioironrouterroutecontrollers relnofollowroute controllera, in order to control page rendering, however this hook doesnt get invoked if only the URLs hash changes f.ex. due to the user clicking a link with codehrefaboutcode.

Positive 365 pI have created a basic Routingsystem in PHP. The url is split into an array, so that i can decide what to show depending on the URL ex www.domain.compageoptionparam.p  pSo in my index.php Ive defined a div for header, content and footer, and the page determines which file to include in the contentdiv. The routing works, and the HTML is loaded, but the stylesheet doesnt seem to be. Neither does it work when I codeltlinkgtcode the stylesheet directly in the file and supposedly its possible to link a stylesheet within the body, with the attribude codeitempropcode rather than coderelcode  anyways, does anyone know what could be causing thisp  p.htaccessp  precodeRewriteEngine On RewriteCond REQUESTFILENAME f RewriteCond REQUESTFILENAME d RewriteRule . index.phpuri1 [QSA,L] codepre  pMy routing uses codeSERVER[REQUESTURI]code to get the URL, and i then remove the index and split the rest into an array  all of this works fine.p  pThanks in advance.p

Ive set it to A in the 1st place.  In the first condition If the user is from Hungary then make myvar1 equal to AB. Next I want to check if the user have written the ENG or the HU URL in the browser. I want to redirect the user if he wrote an exact URL of www.domain.com. If he did, then I set my myvar1 to ABC. And in the 3rd if, if the value of myvar1 equals ABC, then inicialise the redirection. p  pMy problems are I dont know how to check the URL. I found this problem while I wrote a PHP file to show me the value of myvar1 after entering the site and it turned out the value of myvar1 os always only AB. Im failing to check the URL.

Negative 365 pIve got an unusual situation Im using a Linux system in an embedded situation Intel box, currently using a 2.6.20 kernel. which has to communicate with an embedded system that has a partially broken TCP implementation. As near as I can tell right now they expect each message from us to come in a separate Ethernet frame They seem to have problems when messages are split across Ethernet frames. p  pWe are on the local network with the device, and there are no routers between us just a switch.p  pWe are, of course, trying to force them to fix their system, but that may not end up being feasible.p  pIve already set TCPNODELAY on my sockets I connect to them, but that only helps if I dont try to send more than one message at a time. If I have several outgoing messages in a row, those messages tend to end up in one or two Ethernet frames, which causes trouble on the other system.p  pI can generally avoid the problem by using a timer to avoid sending messages too close together, but that obviously limits our throughput. Further, if I turn the time down too low, I risk network congestion holding up packet transmits and ending up allowing more than one of my messages into the same packet.p  pIs there any way that I can tell whether the driver has data queued or not Is there some way I can force the driver to send independent write calls in independent transport layer packets Ive had a look through the socket7 and tcp7 man pages and I didnt find anything. It may just be that I dont know what Im looking for. p  pObviously, UDP would be one way out, but again, I dont think we can make the other end change anything much at this point.p  pAny help greatly appreciated.p

The z80 CPU has an instruction called a hrefhttpz80heaven.wikidot.cominstructionsset3adjnz relnofollowDJNZa which can be used in a similar manner as a codeforcode loop.

Negative 365 pWhats the best way to link formal specs to JIRA enhancement requestsp  pI want to track changes to specifications using JIRA.p  pIdeally, Id like to refer to a functional ID reference in a JIRA ticket e.g. MYAPPAPPROVAL LOGICMAIN SCREEN, so that program managers can retrospectively categorise defects. p  pThe reason for this, is so that QA scripts and documentation tickets can be searchedcategorised meaningfully in the tracking system.p  pThere seems to be a million possible ways to do this, e.g. p  ul lishould I write a custom component to select functional IDs from a treeli lishould I write the specs in confluence, or another CMS with a TrackBack facilityli lishould I include a link to the documentation URLli lishould I use some other 3rd party plugin applicationli lishould I use some Atlassian application that im unaware ofli liam I using the wrong tracking toolprocess to measure spec growthli ul  pWhats the best way, in your experiencep  hr  pThanks for the replyp  pThere is another option that Im considering, which is to implement the functional requirement as an actual ticket. p  pThis makes a lot of sense to me at least, because a functional requirements have owners, a lifecycle, and a clear concept of sub tickets for simple enhancements etc. The ability to link issues allows it to be connected to QA activities, documentation tickets, or any other kind of work. Functional requirements also link together, so the model fits.p  pThe problem with this approach, is that unless you want to create every defect ticket as a subtask to a requirement and forgo additional subtask functionality, you have to create, and then link the ticket, using the standard link ticket functionality, which isnt very quick to use. This is a high resistance workflow, which means it requires a lot of discipline. p  pId ideally like to be able to create a ticket, that is automatically linked to another ticket, similarly to the functionality of linking a sub ticket.p  pI cant be the first person to want to do this  I dont suppose you know of anyone who has tried this that you know of, or released a tool to making this easierp

Negative 365 pI have a what I think is a simple machine learning question.p  pHere is the basic problem I am repeatedly given a new object and a list of descriptions about the object. For example newobject codebobcode newobjectdescriptions code[tall,old,funny]code. I then have to use some kind of machine learning to find previously handled objects that have the 10 or less most similar descriptions, for example, pastsimilarobjects code[frank,steve,joe]code. Next, I have an algorithm that can directly measure whether these objects are indeed similar to bob, for example, correctobjects code[steve,joe]code. The classifier is then given this feedback training of successful matches. Then this loop repeats with a new object. a Heres the pseudocodep  precodeClassifiernewclassifier  while True     newobject,newobjectdescriptions  getnewobjectanddescriptions     pastsimilarobjects  Classifier.classifynewobject,newobjectdescriptions     correctobjects  calcsuccessfulmatchesnewobject,pastsimilarobjects     Classifier.trainsuccessfulmatchesobject,correctobjects codepre  pBut, there are some stipulations that may limit what classifier can be usedp  ul lipThere will be millions of objects put into this classifier so classification and training needs to scale well to millions of object types and still be fast. I believe this disqualifies something like a spam classifier that is optimal for just two types spam or not spam. Update I could probably narrow this to thousands of objects instead of millions, if that is a problem.pli lipAgain, I prefer speed when millions of objects are being classified, over accuracy.pli lipUpdate The classifier should return the 10 or fewer most similar objects, based on feedback from past training. Without this limit, an obvious cheat would be for the classifier could just return all past objects pli ul  pWhat are decent, fast machine learning algorithms for this purposep  pNote The calcsuccessfulmatches distance metric is extremely expensive to calculate and thats why Im using a fast machine learning algorithm to try to guess which objects will be close before I actually do the expensive calculation.p

The browser looks like it wants the top parent domain to be the same as the innerinnerinner iframe domain. p  pThis would suggest that the parent form attribute doesnt refer to the contextual parent, it refers to the top parent although the event capture happens in that iframes direct parent... maybe it will always bublle all the way upp  pembtw, if anyone cares to know, this is a facebook app, its a canvas page that contains an iframe that has a multifriend request selector inside.emp

Negative 365 pI am custom drawing a text box and now I am implementing the part where the user can click on a line and have the cursor move to where he clicked.p  pI know how to get the row of text he clicked on because the character height is constant across all fonts, but not the column, because Im not sure how to say get me all the text that can be drawn before this amount of pixels, and because character width is not consistent unless youre using a fixedwidth font, which is not a guarantee.p  pSo I have the point from which Im drawing the string code0code then I have the point that the user clicked.

Negative 365 pI was looking at this other questionp  pa hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions3620684directorylastmodifieddateDirectory last modified dateap  pwhich tells me how stuff works, but doesnt really give any solution. How would I get the time  which a directory was last modified I would be using this time to determine whether i need to clear a cache, whose contents are calculated from the contents of the directory.p  pOne alternative would be to recurse through every file and subfolder, but that would probably completely negate any benefits of caching in the first place. As far as I can tell, the mtime and other metadata for filesfolders are cached somewhere and do not actually require a fileread every time you want to check which is the reason why checking mtime on every memcached file is still much faster than loading the files themselves, even when the files are tiny. p  pSo... is there any nice, fast way of getting the lastmodified timestamp of an entire directoryp

Single signon improves the user experience, because applications no longer need to prompt a user separately for login information related to an account. It also simplifies the development model for you by managing the account authorization process for your application. In iOS 5.0, applications can use this framework in conjunction with the Twitter framework to access a users Twitter account.p      pFor more information about the classes of the Accounts framework, see a hrefhttpdeveloper.apple.comlibraryiosdocumentationAccountsReferenceAccountsFrameworkRefindex.htmlapplerefdocuidTP40011024 relnofollowAccounts Framework Referencea.p blockquote  pTo my understanding this is not the equivalent of the Keychain on the Mac, which can store username and passwords, but it uses a hrefhttpoauth.net relnofollowOAutha which seems to work  with a token for authentication, rather than a username and a password.p  pNow the points I am not certain aboutp  ol lipIf I want to make use of the Accounts framework do I have to change the Authentication mechanism on my server backend.

However, once I stuck it in a real application Visual Studio 2010 C Compiler and ran wholeprogram optimization w linktime code generation, optimize for speed, etc., I started seeing serious problems. Specifically, I have a function like thisp  precodevoid MyClassmyFunc Index x, Contlt Index gt container, uint r        ... Return if x is invalid     cerr ltlt VFPTR  ltlt void uint  void ampverts[0] ltlt endl     container.add x       ...Potentially add some more things to container.  codepre  pWhich gives me output like this note that the insane typecast is a hack to get the value of the virtual function table in VCp  precodeVFPTR 0AD98708  Repeat above line 17 times VFPTR 0018B830 codepre  pFirstly, it seems very strange indeed that the virtual function pointer emcanem be different. Secondly, it is annoying that this same code works in Debug mode this only shows up when optimization is turned on. Thirdly, its notable that the new pointer 0018B830 is a pointer to the virtual function table in the embaseem class, ContBase. The crash then occurs when you call container.addx, a NULL value.p  pSo my core question here is Is this legal code, or have I missed an undefined behavior case Is Microsofts compiler broken here, or is my code undefined to begin withp

Negative 365 pI have been using a few crossplatform GUI libraries such as FLTK, wxWidgets, GTK, however I feel like none fulfil my needs as I would like to create something that looks the same regardless of the platform I understand that there will be people against building GUIs that dont have a native look on the platforms but thats not the issue here.   To build my controls, I usually rely on basic shapes provided by the library and make my way up binding amp coding everything together...p  pSo I decided to give it a try and do some opengl for 2D GUI programming as it would still be crossplatform. With that in mind, I couldnt help to notice that the applications that I have written using wxWidgets amp FLTK usually have a average RAM consume of 12MB, whereas a very basic openGL window with a simple background ranges from 6 to 9 MB.p  pThis brings me to the actual question for this thread, I thought that all the rendering of the screen was made using either opengldirect under the covers.p  pCould someone please explain or link me some sort of article that could give me some insight of how these things actually workp  pThanks for readingp

Negative 365 pI dont know if this is a proper question here.p  pAs we know, in the CAP theorem, A means Availability. On a hrefhttpen.wikipedia.orgwikiCAPtheorem relnofollowwikipediaa, the explanation of Availability is p  precodeAvailability a guarantee that every request receives a response about whether it was successful or failed codepre  pHowever, from the perspective of engineering, there is no strongABSOLUTEstrong availability. We can only say that the availability of a system is 5999.999, or even 89, but we cannot say that the availability of a system is 100, 100 available system does not exit in reality, even if the system has millions of duplicated nodes, rightp  pThe CAP theorem proves that no system could satisfy the 3 requirements simultaneously. My question is, if a system claims to satisfy both A and P, what is the accurate meaning of this A 69 or even higherp

Negative 365 pSo Im trying to use emAFNetworkingem library for REST services on a project I want to build on my 2006 Macbook. The Macbook is a firstgen 2006 32bit Core Duo w snow leopard. p  pIm fairly new to ObjectiveC development and Im following the tutorial to get started with AFNetworking here a hrefhttpsgithub.comAFNetworkingAFNetworkingwikiGettingStartedwithAFNetworking relnofollowhttpsgithub.comAFNetworkingAFNetworkingwikiGettingStartedwithAFNetworkingap  pUsing xcode 4.2  my problem is that right away when I create a new project and try and build I get emSemantic Issue  Synthesized property window must either be named the same as a compatible ivar or must explicitly name ivarem.p  pI checked the Build Settings of my new project and for some reason xcode by default assumes 64bit Intel architecture when my machine is 32bit weird. I swapped it to 32bit and this is where the error came up. p  pSo I can correct this Semantic Issue now by explicitly creating my own window instance var in AppDelegate viap  precodeNSWindow  window codepre  pI read about this on building out for 32bit objc a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions4511700synthesizingapropertywithoutinstancevariablesSynthesizing a property without instance variablesa which seems VERY common lack of ivar declarations in lots of public github project code I see. Is everyone forcing 64bit on us now or just too lazy to create the instance vars p  pSo my problem is that it looks like AFNetworking library was built out for 64bit Intel because when I add AFNetworking to my project I get the strongsamestrong Semantic Issue ivar errors all over the place. Looking at the library code there are no explicit instance variables declared throughout the code for any properties.p  pAm I completely screwed here I could fix this situation by manually creating instance vars for all the properties but this would be such a pain for longterm project maintenance.p  pI guess what Im wishing here is that there was some sort of compiler flag that I could add that would fix this all in oneshot but Im guessing that Im out of luck and its simply time to trash this Macbook and pickup a new modern one. p
Negative 365 pI have a project in which i have to create a panel from blocks that are 3x1 and 4.5x1.  For structural integrity, the spaces between the blocks must not line up in adjacent rows.

Negative 365 pI use Word automation from an Delphi application, and it is very slow. I have stripped my code down to the bare minimum, and was hoping that someone with some experience can tell me where Ive gone wrong and Im actually hoping i emhaveem gone wrong, so that I can speed it upp  pThe essence of the automation in my application deals with bookmarks. The application opens a document with some special bookmarks, runs through these and change them based on their names. The real version also deals heavily with document variables and fieldcodes. A typical document has 5080 bookmarks, some of which are nested. I also use some temporary documents to build blocks of text and images, that are placed consecutively in the document to be generated. The attached code is a VERY stripped down version without this functionality, but it displays the unwanted behaviour i.e. the time to generate a document. In the attached sample it takes about 2,5 seconds to generate the document. For a typical real document it takes about 3040 seconds, sometimes more.p  pWhat Im hoping for is for someone to say Youre doing this all wrong. When doing Word Automation from Delphi, you must always remember to XXX. p  pSince the full project, even when stripped down completely, is quite large, I have made this small application. If there is an obvious mistake in the way I do it, it will hopefully be apparent from this code. p  pPlease create a new VCL Forms Application. Open Word, and create a new document. Enter some text on the first line, mark it and insert bookmark. Enter some text on the second line, and bookmark this too. Save the file as ctempbm.doc as a Word 972003 document. After running the application you should have a new document ctempbmgenerated.doc with a random number on the first line, and no bookmarks.p  precodeunit Unit1  interface  uses   Winapi.Windows, Winapi.Messages, System.SysUtils, System.Variants, System.Classes, Vcl.Graphics,   Vcl.Controls, Vcl.Forms, Vcl.Dialogs, OleServer, WordXP, Vcl.StdCtrls  type   TForm1  classTForm     Button1 TButton     procedure Button1ClickSender TObject   private      Private declarations    public    end  var   Form1 TForm1  implementation  R .dfm  procedure TForm1.Button1ClickSender TObject var   vWordApp     TWordApplication   vDoc         WordDocument   vFileName    OleVariant   vIndex       OleVariant   vBookmark    Bookmark   vSave        OleVariant begin   vWordApp  TWordApplication.Createnil   try     vWordApp.ConnectKind  ckNewInstance     vWordApp.Connect     vFileName  ctempbm.doc     vDoc  vWordApp.Documents.OpenvFileName, EmptyParam, EmptyParam, EmptyParam, EmptyParam, EmptyParam, EmptyParam, EmptyParam, EmptyParam, EmptyParam, EmptyParam, EmptyParam, EmptyParam, EmptyParam, EmptyParam      Replace bookmark text with random string     vIndex  1     vBookmark  vDoc.Bookmarks.ItemvIndex     vBookmark.Range.Text  inttostrrandom10000 Will also delete the bookmark      Delete bookmark content and bookmark     vIndex  1 This will be the bookmark that was originally the first, since that was deleted when we sat the text     vBookmark  vDoc.Bookmarks.ItemvIndex     vWordApp.Selection.SetRangevBookmark.Range.Start, vBookmark.Range.End     vWordApp.Selection.Text        vFileName  ctempbmgenerated.doc     vDoc.SaveAs2000vFileName, EmptyParam, EmptyParam, EmptyParam, EmptyParam, EmptyParam, EmptyParam, EmptyParam, EmptyParam, EmptyParam, EmptyParam      vWordApp.NormalTemplate.Saved  true For  slippe sprsml om normal.dot skal lagres     vSave  wdDoNotSaveChanges     vWordApp.QuitvSave     vWordApp.Disconnect   finally     vWordApp.Free   end end  end. codepre

My question is whether there is equivalent functionality in Java or if a similar approach is even considered best practices in the Java incarnation of AppEngine. p  pDoes Java have an alternate way to achieve this functionality, or is there some alternate paradigm for how Java Servlets handle this sort of thingp  pI am aware that the web.xml file gives you the opportunity to map urls to servelets, but Im not sure if thats the proper way. p  pWhats the standard way that one might map URLs in the Java version of AppEngine to have different functionality triggered by different URLsp  pThanks.p
Negative 365 pI am making an application that will save information for certain files. I was wondering what the best way to keep track of files. I was thinking of using the absolute path for a file but that could change if the file is renamed. I found that if you run ls i each file has an id beside it that is unique. Is that ok to use for a unique file idp  pThanks.p
Negative 365 pThe following used to work on Firefox 3.5.x and 3.6.x but it no longer does in Firefox 11.x or Safari 5.1.x.

This results in people coming over the team to ask Where do we raise items a lot. p  pAs you cant set a default value for the iteration path in TFS 2010 we think the best solution would be to add a string of text under the field which we can manually update every 7 weeks with the correct area to raise items in. p  pHowever TFS doesnt seem to allow just a line of text on its work items as a control.

Negative 365 pI am trying to research the best language  framework to use to solve my problem. I have started looking very closely at Ruby on Rails but was wondering if some of you might be able to shed some light on why this might be a good or not a good choice.p  pWhat I need is to develop a web application that can be built upon an existing oracle database. I need it to be secure but would ideally I do not want to write my own user permission  authentication logic. Instead would like to have a customizable one that I can leverage off of. I have seen ruby on rails have many gems that look like this would not be a problem. p  pSecondly I need something that I can easily reuse code for CRUD functionality on data sets. Most of this application will revolve around the users being able to edit records etc. p  pLastly and most importantly, this needs to work with an existing Oracle backend. As I started to read about ruby it seemed that hooking it up with Oracle might cause some issues. One concern I had was it seemed that you needed to install Oracle on your machine in order for it to work, my database is not on my machine but on a different server and I would prefer not to have to install oracle but rather just connect to my development servers database... is this possible p  pThank you for your input and help. p

Negative 365 pIve added support for mods for my game. Any Python module put in a specific folder is automatically imported on startup. All is fine, except now Ive written an official mod which allows mod makers to easily add GUI settings of their mods to a single toggable GUI frame. They are not forced to use it, but it greatly simplifies adding GUI settings with helper functions and makes things more organized and simpler for the players.p  pThe problem is since its a mod itself, its imported on startup with the rest of the mods Python modules, so if there is another mod which has a name which comes before it, it cannot use my mod. I know I could add 0 or something to my modules name, but that wouldnt be very clean and you cant be very sure someone wont name his own mods modules like that.p  pSo Im wondering if theres any way to tell Python to import a module first, by specifying it inside the module itself Im pretty sure there isnt, but who knowsp  pOne solution I thought of is to make a subfolder which would be searched for modules first.p  pAnother one might be merging the mods code with the games. Dont want to do that as to not give the impression that its the only way to add mod settings.p
Negative 365 pAfter my last post, when someone recommended me to use pBuffers, I digged a bit on Google and I found some cool examples to make Offscreen Rendering, using pbuffers. Some example, available on nVidias website, does a simple offscreen rendering, which just renders on the pbuffer context, reads the pixels into an array and then calls the opengl functions to DrawPixels. p  pI changed this example, in order to create a texture from the pixels read  Render it offscreen, read the pixels to the array, and then initialize a texture with this colorbit array. But this looks very redundant to me  We render the image, we copy it from Graphical Card memory into our memory the array, to later copy it back to the graphical card in order to display it on screen, but just in a different rendering context. It looks kinda stupid the copies that I am making just to display the rendered texture, so I tried a different approach using glCopyTexImage2D, which unfortunately doesnt work. Ill display code and explanationsp  precodemypbuffer.Initialize256, 256, false, false codepre  p The false values are for Sharing context and sharing object. They are false cause this fantastic graphical card doesnt support it.p  pThen I perform the usual initializations, to enable Blending, and GLTEXTURE2D.p  precode    CreateTexture     mypbuffer.Activate          int viewport[4]         glGetIntegervGLVIEWPORT,intviewport         glViewport0,0,xSize,ySize           DrawScenehDC          save data to texture using glCopyTexImage2D         glBindTextureGLTEXTURE2D,texture          glCopyTexImage2DGLTEXTURE2D, 0, GLRGBA,                          0,0, xSize, ySize, 0         glClearColor.0f, 0.5f, 0.5f, 1.0f                 Set The Clear Color To Medium Blue         glClearGLCOLORBUFFERBIT  GLDEPTHBUFFERBIT          glViewportviewport[0],viewport[1],viewport[2],viewport[3]          glBindTextureGLTEXTURE2D,texture         first  false         mypbuffer.Deactivate codepre  p The DrawScene function is very simple, it just renders a triangle and a rectangle, which is suposed to be offscreen rendered I HOPE. CreateTexture creates an empty texture. The function should work, as it was tested in the previous way I described and it works.p  pAfter this, in the main loop, i just do the followingp  precode            glClearGLCOLORBUFFERBIT             glBindTextureGLTEXTURE2D,texture              glRotateftheta, 0.0f, 0.0f, 0.01f             glBeginGLQUADS             Front Face             glTexCoord2f0.0f, 0.0f             glVertex3f0.5, 0.5f,  0.5f             glTexCoord2f1.0f, 0.0f             glVertex3f 0.5f, 0.5f,  0.5f             glTexCoord2f1.0f, 1.0f             glVertex3f 0.5f,  0.5f,  0.5f             glTexCoord2f0.0f, 1.0f             glVertex3f0.5f,  0.5f,  0.5f             glEnd             SwapBuffershDC              theta  0.10f             Sleep 1 codepre  pThe final result is just a window with a blue background, nothing got actually Rendered.

Negative 365 pI know that the way the names are in the HtmlHelper is what is breaking the model binding. But I havent figured out how to fix it. Or if there is even a fix. p  pA little explanation. Im using one model to populate the text, controls, default values select lists, and values saved. Im using the other ViewModel to only return the value, dataid, and ctrltypeid. What has been commented out is the code ex Html.TextBoxFor that is causing the postback ViewModel to be unpopulated. The working code ex Html.TextBox does as expected.

Negative 365 pI am currently working on a neural network based approach to short document classification, and since the corpuses I am working with are usually around ten words, the standard statistical document classification methods are of limited use. Due to this fact I am attempting to implement some form of automated synonym detection for the matches provided in the training. My question more specifically is about resolving a situation as followsp  pSay I have classifications of Involving Food, and one of Involving Spheres and a data set as followsp  precodeEating ApplesFoodEating MarblesSpheres Eating OrangesFood, Spheres Throwing BaseballsSpheresThrowing ApplesFoodThrowing BallsSpheres Spinning ApplesFoodSpinning Baseballs codepre  pI am looking for an incremental method that would move towards the following linkagesp  precodeEating gt Food Apples gt Food Marbles gt Spheres Oranges gt Food, Spheres Throwing gt Spheres Baseballs gt Spheres Balls gt Spheres Spinning gt Neutral Involving gt Neutral codepre  pI do realize that in this specific case these might be slightly suspect matches, but it illustrates the problems I am having. My general thoughts were that if I incremented a word for appearing opposite the words in a category, but in that case I would end up incidentally linking everything to the word Involving, I then thought that I would simply decrement a word for appearing in conjunction with multiple synonyms, or with nonsynonyms, but then I would lose the link between Eating and Food. Does anyone have any clue as to how I would put together an algorithm that would move me in the directions indicated above p
Negative 365 pI have my own codeTableModelcode implementation designed to show data from a codeSQLcode database. I have overidden  all the necessary methods, using a String array for column names, an codearraylistltObject[]gtcode for data and codeClassltgt[]code array for all the different types that can be retrieved from the database. I also have a boolean array that dictates which columns are editable and which are not. Before I had everything in the table stored as an Object and hadnt implemented the types part yet and it was working well. Now that Ive added the types to the model, I cant edit any column of the int type even though that column is editable in my boolean array. I have overridden the codeisEditablecode method to simply return the value from that boolean array, and that returns true on the into column in question  but it is still uneditable. Is this define behaviour or is something wrong Im afraid I cant post code at the moment because Im on my phone, my laptop has no internet connection at the moment and wont until the end of the week. Ive searched but Google only shows lots of questions about making cells editable or uneditable, not why you cannot edit an int column. EDIT heres a pastebin showing my problem a hrefhttppastebin.comcYJnyyqy relnofollowhttppastebin.comcYJnyyqyap  pUsing codejdk7code and only the string column is editable, even though codeisEditablecode returns true for all columns.p

Negative 365 pI am creating a flash game, and I would like the users to be able to log on using Facebook. So far I have used the facebookactionscript API to successfully create a .swf file that allows users to log in to my flash game. From here, I have access to their information such as their Facebook ID and name.p  pMy suggested approach from here which may be rather naive was to use the Facebook ID as a unique identifier for a user. I would then include this id when making calls to the php backend.p  pFor example, if a user wanted to retrieve their list of items. I would send a get items request to php containing their Facebook id. In my database, I would store the Facebook ID of each user and thus would be able to return the right items.p  pI was just wondering if there was a differentbetter approach to this sort of thing.

Negative 365 pthe Gimple internal representation IR of GCC provides some data flow analysis for each basic block in the SSA Static Single Assignment form.

One option is to write a parser that takes Gimple and generates a codedotcode file. I was wondering if there is already such a tool that does that. It does not seem difficult to write such a parser, but I am afraid that I might get stuck in dealing with a lot of corner cases. p  pPlease note My google search was not that fruitful since the tools I found like a hrefhttpgccpythonplugin.readthedocs.orgenlatestexamples.html relnofollowthisa only generate control flow graphs. p

Negative 365 pWould it ever make sense to construct an application which uses two different methods of storing data within the application  Its probably easiest to clarify what Im getting at with an examplep  pSay that Im running an online bookstore, and need to keep track of books, customers, orders, etc.  My natural instinct here is to use a relational database to hold this kind of information.  Now, lets say that when my customers have an account with me, they can configure their homepage in various ways.  For example, suppose there is a clock widget which can have different types analogdigital, colors, and can be positioned any place on the page or not shown at all.  We want to store this information so that when the customer logs in the widget is the correct type, color, and in the correct position.  Maybe there are multiple widgets which the customer may or may not use, each with their own attributes.  The customerspecific attributes need to be flexible in other words.  My instinct on this kind of thing would be to store this information in another format like XML, although I havent needed to use XML in any projects thus far.  It also seems to me that something like MongoDB might make sense for holding this type of info, but I really dont know enough about it to make an intelligent judgement.p  pDoes it make sense to separate out this kind of information or should the relational DB be abstracted to hold this type of information  Im sure there is no right answer here, but your insights would be appreciated.p
Negative 365 pI have the following code to test that when a certain name is passed to my method, it throws a SQL exception there is reason to that one, although it sounds a little odd.p  precode   mockAccountDAL.Setupm gt m.CreateAccountIt.IsAnyltstringgt,  Display Name 2, It.IsAnyltstringgt.ThrowsltSqlExceptiongt codepre  pHowever, this wont compile because SqlExceptions constructor is internalp  blockquote   pSystem.Data.SqlClient.SqlException must be a nonabstract type with   a public parameterless constructor in order to use it as parameter   TException in the generic type or method   Moq.Language.IThrows.Throwsp blockquote  pNow, I could change this to state that it should throw codeExceptioncode, but that wouldnt work for me, because my method should return one status code if it is a codeSqlExceptioncode and another if it is any other exception. Thats what my unit test is testing. p  pIs there any way to achieve this without either changing the logic of the method Im testing, or not testing this scenariop

Negative 365 pI have a problem concerning target definitions in Eclipse. I want to use plugin version 1.0.0, which is in my target platform definition, while I have the plugin project in my workspace with version 1.0.2. For all other plugins in my target definition, everything works as expected which I see because an error gets flagged if somethings missing, but this specific one, Eclipse does not make available to my projects. Only the plugin version 1.0.2 is. The plugin is not set as a singleton.p  pWhy is this and how can I resolve this problemp  hr  pI figured out that I can access the right version when I close the project that contains the wrong one  but this is awkward, is there another wayp  hr  pIt seems that its actually not an eclipsespecific problem, it fails also when building on the command line through maventycho. Specifically, my target platform is the Juno Release. Are there plugins that, while part of a feature, are not made available to other bundles I know the plugin is there, but neither tycho nor Eclipse want to make it available to me.p  pMaybe I should also say it fails at compile time.p  hr  pWhile, as I said, there exist workarounds for the problem, I still would like to have a nice solution to this problem. You can check out the project together with the target definition at a hrefhttpsgithub.comkutschkemJayeshttpsgithub.comkutschkemJayesap  pYou may also need to check out and build this project first git clone a hrefhttpgit.eclipse.orggitrootrecommendersorg.eclipse.recommenders.githttpgit.eclipse.orggitrootrecommendersorg.eclipse.recommenders.gitap  pAfter setting the target platform, try building something with Jayes 1.0.0 which is in the target platform instead of Jayes 1.0.2 which is in your workspace. You can also try to build with maven, it doesnt work as well.p  pKnown workaroundsp  ol liClose the Jayes 1.0.2 project. Then, eclipse lets you use Jayes 1.0.0li liFor running an OSGi application, you can choose which bundles are loaded.

Negative 365 pI have am making a map editor for a game which has a user control that has an image. Inside that control I attached the codeMouseWheelcode event to it, but Ive noticed two issues that I hope to have a better understanding of why it behaves the way it does and how to properly implement it. p  pFor one the event only seems to fire when the mouse is hovering over it instead of when the control is in focus. If possible I would like to switch that and be able to fire the event no matter where the mouse is as long as that control is in focus and the second issue is that checking the delta when the number is positive works fine, but when I get a number back when its negative I get a value of 0xfffffffd or something in that range. How would I go about differentiating the difference between a positive balue and a negative value if I always get something positivep  pThanks in advance for the help.p

Negative 365 pI failed at this problem for several hours now and just cant get my head around it. It seems fairly simple from a human POV, but somehow I just cant seem able to write it into code.p  pSituation Given several number ranges that are defined by a starting number and the current active number which are assigned to specific locations or 0 for generic onesp  precodestartno    actualno  location 100        159       0 200        203       1 300        341       2 400        402       0 codepre  pNow, as you can see, there can also be two ranges for one location. In this case, only the range with the highest startno in this case, 400 is regarded as active, the other one only exists for history purposes.p  pEvery user is assigned to a specific location the same IDs as in the location column, but never to a generic one zero.p  pWhen a used wants a new number, he will get a number assigned from a range that is assigned to his location, or, if none is found, from the highest generic one e.g. user.location  0 would get 403, user.location  2 would get 342.p  pThen, the user can select to either use this number or an amount X starting from the assigned number.p  pHere comes the question How can I assure that the ranges dont overlap into each other Say the user location  2 gets the next number 342 and decides he needs 100 numbers following that. This would produce the end number to 441, which is inside the generic range, which mustnt happen.p  pI tried around with several nested SELECTs, using both the starting and ending number, aggregating MAX, JOINing the table on itself, but I just cant get it 100 right.p

Since i keep seeing multiple examples of people calling the method without needing to pass a parameter.li ol  porp  ol liIm not registering the method as a listener properly in the Model.li ol  pAlso, I have directly copied and pasted the demo from the ShowCase into a project and it didnt work which is making me lean more towards an issue with NetBeans. that is, the dialog appears but with no information on the event that was selectedp  pSo to summarize events are showing up as they should on the schedule itself, I just cant get the dialog to show the event details of the event that was selected.p  pAny help would be greatly appreciatedp  pView Layerp  precodelthformgt     ltpschedule idnelsonsSchedule valuecmodel.scheduleModel showHeadertrue                 leftHeaderTemplatenone rightHeaderTemplateprev, next today                 draggablefalse timeZoneUTC styleClassschedulegt                                            ltpajax eventeventSelect listenercmodel.onEventSelect                             updateeventDialog eventDetails oncompleteeventDialog.showgt                                        ltpschedulegt                  ltpdialog ideventDialog widgetVareventDialog headerEventDetailsgt                     ltppanel ideventDetailsgt                         lthoutputLabel valuecmodel.selectedEvent.title gt                     ltppanelgt                 ltpdialoggt                                lthformgt   codepre  pBacking Beanp  precodeManagedBeanname  cmodel codepre  pSessionScoped public class CalendarModel implements Serializable p  precodeprivate ScheduleModel scheduleModel private ListltScheduleEventgt allScheduledGames private DefaultScheduleEvent gameEvent public ScheduleEvent selectedEvent ListltGamegt allGames PersistenceContext private EntityManager em  public CalendarModel     PostConstruct public void init      allScheduledGames  new ArrayListltScheduleEventgt     allGames  new ArrayListltGamegt             allGames  em.createNamedQueryGame.findAll.getResultList      create list of games to put into the ScheduleModel     for int i  0 i lt allGames.size i           gameEvent  new DefaultScheduleEventallGames.geti.getOpponent                      nnn  allGames.geti.getTimeOfGame,                     allGames.geti.getDateOfGame,                     allGames.geti.getDateOfGame          ifallGames.geti.getHomeAway.equalsaway             gameEvent.setStyleClassaway          else             gameEvent.setStyleClasshome                                  gameEvent.setDataallGames.geti                    allScheduledGames.addgameEvent     end for      scheduleModel  new DefaultScheduleModelallScheduledGames  end init  public void onEventSelect SelectEvent e      selectedEvent  new DefaultScheduleEvent     selectedEvent  ScheduleEvent e.getObject           codepre

Negative 365 pIve successfully set up GitLab 5.2 on Ubuntu Server 12.04, but Im having a bit of a problem with the default configuration  every user can create projects in his own private group, just like github.

Negative 365 pI was wondering if one could access the validation error message assigned via Bean validation through the UIInputs binding.p  pFor example, i have the following propertyp  precodeNotNullmessage  usernamerequired private String username codepre  pWhen I print the error using hmessage, i get the appropriate message printed out, so I know that Bean Validation works correctly. I would like to print out the message without hmessage tag, supplying the value directly to a tooltip, like thisp  precode ltptooltip forusernameErrorImage renderedusernameInputBinding.valid       valueusernameInputBinding.requiredMessagegt codepre  pThe rendered attribute works as expected, however the value of the tooltip is true, which is not my message. I have also tried convertedMessage and requiredMessage, but both of them also return the string true. Putting the hmessage inside of the tooltip tag prints out the message, however I would like to know if I can access the validation message directly through the binding.p

I originally used the new constructor  ballPic  new Image ballPic.src  ball.png  which worked when drawing on my canvas, but I needed to do some scaling and wasnt sure if I could attach a css id to the object. So I instead tried to use the image tag and did the rest in css.p  pHowever using a variable that way doenst seem to work with my canvas drawingp  precodeballPic  ltimg idsoccerBallgt var cdocument.getElementByIdmyCanvas             var ctxc.getContext2d             ctx.drawImageBallPic, 25, 25   codepre  pIs this because assigning a variable like ballPic   is not the same as being the element itself like when using the constructor How would I pass it other than attaching it to the document and using getElementbyID p

Negative 365 pI have the following css vertical navigation menu I have done. There are up and down images for the parent category 30px high for rollover and separate up and down images for the second and third levels of the menu rollover at 25px high.p  pFor each level, there is a different type of up and down images if there is no continuing category.p  pIt works OK except for 3 areas that I have been struggling with for days now and cant seem to see where I have gone wrong.p  pThe first is that the text for each level gets smaller and smaller for some reason and the second is that at the third level, all the images shown the up and down images as if there it a continuing category, and last but not least, when a category is selected in the first, second or third category, I cant seem to find a way to keep those links highlighted to show the user that they are in that area.p  pI hope someone is able to figure this out as I have been going crazy for days now.

Negative 365 pI have a function to generate a random map given a number of tiles, a starting map, and the type of grid triangular,square,hex to use.  It returns an array of tiles, codemapcode, with two extra properties codeseedcode, the starting map used, and codeadjycode.  Initially, codemapcode is set to equal codeseedcode.  For some reason, codemap.seedcode does not equal the codeseedcode argument.  Instead, codemap.seedcode equals codemapcode.  I figured out that codeseedcode is changed by codemap.pushcode.  I have tried codeuse strictcode, using codearguments[1]code instead of codeseedcode, and moving the statement codemap.seedseedcode around these didnt have any effect.  The code doesnt have any errors in jsHint and doesnt throw any in the console.p  pcodeadjycode is short for adjacency, and is 0 for triangles, 1 for squares, and 2 for hexagons.p  pI have prepared a a hrefhttpjsfiddle.nethacatugLM9X2 relnofollow titlerandom map generatorjsFiddlea and the code is also belowp  precodeconsole.clear var canvasdocument.getElementByIdcanvas,     ctxcanvas.getContext2d canvas.widthwindow.innerWidth canvas.heightwindow.innerHeight ctx.translatecanvas.width2,canvas.height2 Array.prototype.equalsfunctionaarray1array2 is broken, create substitute     return this.lengtha.lengthampampthis.every         functione,i             return e instanceof Array                 a[i]instanceof Arrayampampe.equalsa[i]                 a[i]instanceof Arrayampampea[i]                Array.prototype.includesfunctionn     return this.some         functione             return n instanceof Array                 n.equalse                 ne                function Maptiles,seed,adjy     ifarguments.lengthreturn []     ifarguments.lengthlt2         iftilesseed[[0,0]]         else return []     ifarguments.lengthlt3         iftilesltseed.lengthreturn adjyreturns undefined         else adjy1     var mapseed,cdd[],noscandidate tiles,Neighbors Of Square or tile         [[[0,1,1],[1,0,0]],triangle          [[0,1,0,1],[1,0,1,0]],square          [[0,1,1,0,1,1],[1,0,1,1,0,1]]][adjy]hex     function addAdjpadds adjacent tiles to candidates cdd         var c         forvar i0iltnos[0].lengthi             ifcdd.includes                c[p[0]nos[0][i],p[1]nos[1][i]]ampamp                map.includesc                   cdd.pushc          function pickRpick a random tile         var pcdd.splice             Math.randomcdd.length,1[0] is the same as floor         addAdjp         map.pushpthe line where the problem happens          seed.forEachaddAdj     whiletilesgtmap.lengthpickR     map.seedseed     map.adjyadjy     return map  function drawMapmap     ifmap.hasOwnPropertyadjyreturn void 0     function draw0c         var xc[0],yc[1]         ctx.beginPath         switchxy2             case 0                 x5y7                 ctx.moveTox,y                 ctx.lineTox5,y7                 ctx.lineTox5,y7                 break             default                 x5y7                 ctx.moveTox,y7                 ctx.lineTox5,y                 ctx.lineTox5,y                  ctx.closePath         ctx.fill          function draw1c         var xc[0],yc[1]         ctx.fillRectx10,y10,10,10          function draw2c         var xc[0]7,yc[1]         xy3.5         y7.5         ctx.beginPath         ctx.moveTox,y         ctx.lineTox,y5         ctx.lineTox3.5,y7.5         ctx.lineTox7,y5         ctx.lineTox7,y         ctx.lineTox3.5,y2.5         ctx.closePath         ctx.fill          switchmap.adjy         case 0             map.forEachdraw0             break         case 1             map.forEachdraw1             break         default             map.forEachdraw2       var boardnew Map376,[[5,0],[5,0]],2 console.logboard.seed drawMapboard codepre  pI have included all of the code in case the problem is not in fact that codeseedcode is updated when codemapcode is, though my developer console tests suggest this.p

Negative 365 pIm trying to create a screenshot application using windows service, that can capture complete screen at regular time intervals. To get started with, I took basic window service example a hrefhttpcode.msdn.microsoft.comwindowsdesktopCppWindowsServicecacf4948 relnofollowhttpcode.msdn.microsoft.comwindowsdesktopCppWindowsServicecacf4948a and included screenshot utility class in the project and called the capture function in the onStart method of sample windows service. However, I got blank screen shots. Later I realized that windows service runs in different session and hence the screenshots are blank.p  pS, I decoupled the screenshot utility class and made it as a seperate project and generated a .exe out of it which is capable of writing logs to a file where ever needed. This time, I used createProcessWithLogonW function to call the executable, so that it will run the exe in specified user domain than the default service session. The following is the code snippet I have been using.p  precodevoid CSampleServiceStartProcess      DWORD dwSize HANDLE hTokenNULL     LPVOID lpvEnv PROCESSINFORMATION pi  0     STARTUPINFO si  0     WCHAR szUserProfile[256]  L     si.cb  sizeofSTARTUPINFO      if CreateEnvironmentBlockamplpvEnv, hToken, TRUE              loggerWlogloggerfileName,CreateEnvironmentBlock Error           dwSize  sizeofszUserProfilesizeofWCHAR      GetUserProfileDirectoryhToken, szUserProfile, ampdwSize      CreateProcessWithLogonWLadmin, LMyDomain,Lmypassword,         LOGONWITHPROFILE, NULL, LCTempapplication.exe,         CREATEUNICODEENVIRONMENT, lpvEnv, NULL, ampsi, amppi      DestroyEnvironmentBlocklpvEnv     CloseHandlehToken     CloseHandlepi.hProcess     CloseHandlepi.hThread     WaitForSingleObjectpi.hProcess, INFINITE     CloseHandlepi.hProcess     CloseHandlepi.hThread  codepre  pI have no errors from the logs i got. when the services get initiated, it gives a warning of interactive service trying to show a message. When I click that, I received a black screenshot again. I know that there are many things involved here, I just gave a high level view of what Im doing. Also, im pretty new to windows programming.

Negative 365 pUp until today Ive been using MVVM Lights EventToCommand for event handling in XAML. I decided to try out InputBinding for mouse events and so far the results have been far from pleasing. Im guessing Im doing something wrong because theres a delay of maybe half a second between mouse clicks. With EventToCommand, the UI will update as fast as I can click it. All this test program does at the moment is fills a circle on a canvas either white or black when its clicked.p  precodeltCanvasgt     ltEllipse Canvas.LeftBinding X         Canvas.TopBinding Y         Width16         Height16         FillBlackgt         ltEllipse.InputBindingsgt             ltMouseBinding CommandBinding RelativeSourceRelativeSource ModeFindAncestor,                                 AncestorTypexType UserControl,                                 PathDataContext.ClickEllipse                        CommandParameterBinding RelativeSourceRelativeSource ModeFindAncestor,                                 AncestorTypexType Ellipse                        MouseActionLeftClick gt ltEllipse.InputBindingsgt codepre  h2    h2  precodepublic RelayCommandltobjectgt ClickEllipse  get set  ClickEllipse  new RelayCommandltobjectgto gt ExecuteClickEllipseo  private void ExecuteClickEllipseobject o              var obj  o as Ellipse          if obj.Fill  Brushes.Black                      obj.Fill  Brushes.White             TestText  White                  else                      obj.Fill  Brushes.Black             TestText  Black               codepre  pWhat am I doing anything wrong here to cause the delay between clicks I cant imagine that this would be the intended behavior. I have EventToCommand set up almost identically and it has no problems. Furthermore, assuming I did make a stupid mistake and this isnt intended behavior, are there any advantages of InputBinding over EventToCommand for Key and Mouse events or vice versa How do the 2 differ in terms of functionality and performance if thats even an issue in this situationp  pEdit  Something else Ive noticed with both InputBinding and EventToCommand which I have set up almost identically is that each time the circle is clicked, task manager shows the programs memory usage jumping up a bit.

Negative 365 pIm dealing with Godaddy auction domains, they provide some way to download domains listing. I do have a cron job developed to download amp dump insert domains listing into my database table. This process takes few seconds from download and dumping into database. The total number of domains records in this case are 34000 entries.p  pSecond, I need to update the page rank for each individual domain in database for total 34000 records. I have the PHP API for fetching the page rank live. The Godaddy downloads dont provide page rank detail so I have to fetch and update it separately. p  pNow, the problem is when it comes to fetching page rank live and then updating page rank into database takes too much time for total 34000 domains.p  pI recently did an experiment via cron job to update page rank for domains in database, it took 4 hours to update page rank just for 13383 domains from 34000 total. Since it has to first fetch and then update into database. This all was going on dedicated server. p  pIs there any way to speed up this process for large number of domains The only way, Im thinking is to accomplish this via multitasking. p  pWould that be possible to have 100 tasks fetching page rank and updating it into database simultaneouslyp  pIn case you need the codep  precodesql  SELECT domain from auctions     mozigetrunQuerysql      whileresults  mysqlfetcharraymoziget          PAGERANK API         ifresults[domain]Featured Listings             echo results[domain].ltbr gt              try                                     url  new SEOstatshttpwww..trimresults[domain]                   rankurlgtGooglePageRank                   ifisintegerrank                     rank0                                                       catch SEOstatsException e                                     rank0                                  try                                     url  new SEOstatstrimhttp.results[domain]                   ranknonurlgtGooglePageRank                   ifisintegerranknon                     ranknon0                                                       catch SEOstatsException e                                     ranknon0                                  sql  UPDATE auctions set rank.rank.,  ranknon.ranknon.

Negative 365 pIm writing a little game with python tkinter module using a canvas widget. There is the person, who is just a ball, and bombs that spawn every 10 seconds. 3 seconds after a bomb spawns, it begins a process of exploding which I call 4 more methods on the self.bomb object to animate it exploding.p  pThe object of the game is to try to disarm the bombs. Ive come up with some fancy collision detection which is working. Once a collision is detected, the bomb is cleared off of the canvas using p  precodeself.canvas.deleteself.bomb codepre  pHowever, the following animation of the bomb getting bigger and changing color exploding still happens, even if Ive disarmed the bomb. This is because my original bomb callsp  precodeself.parent.after3000, self.explodefirst codepre  p... which I have chained 3 more explode functions, all bound and called with the .after method.p  pI tried to circumvent the problem by inserting conditionals into each of the methods called in the .after, like booleansp  precodeif self.bomb  if theres a bomb on the canvas,      self.parent.after125, self.explodesecond  and explode third and so on codepre  pwhich is not working. I want to be able to cancel events the tkinter queue that have been created with the after method, but here is the kicker. I dontcant kill ALL the events, just the ones on the canvas.

For this, I had initially set their minwidth to 192px 9605 and their width to 20, but quickly realized this does not play well with adding 1px borders, causing one of the buttons to be thrown overboard.p  pChanging the widths to 19.895333 and 191px, respectively, solved the issue, however this is clearly a hacky solution which also leaves an ugly space of 23 pixels at the right side of the menu.p  pIs there a more elegant way to align these elements and account for the bonus width added by borders, padding etc I have tried overflowhidden to simply hide whatever may poke outside the container, but this just hides the entire 5th button.p  pA picture to illustrate the result img srchttpi.stack.imgur.comMthyk.jpg altenter image description herep  pThe html codep  precode    ltdiv classmenucontainergt         ltdiv classmenutab idmenutabfirstgtNewsltdivgt         ltdiv classmenutabgtGame Guideltdivgt         ltdiv classmenutabgtArticlesltdivgt         ltdiv classmenutabgtMedialtdivgt         ltdiv classmenutab idmenutablastgtCommunityltdivgt     ltdivgt codepre  pThe css codep  pre classlangcss prettyprintoverridecode.menucontainer      height 26px     marginleft auto     marginright auto     borderwidth 1px     borderstyle solid     bordercolor 303030 101010 000 101010     borderradius 0px 0px 8px 8px   .menutab                     lineheight 26px     float left     width 19.895333     textalign center     minwidth 191px     borderright 1px solid 202020     backgroundimage url..imgmenubutton2.png     backgroundsize 100 100     fontfamily Cabin, sansserif   menutabfirst      borderradius 0px 0px 0px 8px   menutablast      borderright 0px       width 20     minwidth 192px       borderradius 0px 0px 8px 0px  codepre  pThank you in advancep

Negative 365 pIm having a problem importing the numpy module in Eclipse. The codeimport numpycode line runs with no problems. But then if I try use a function from the numpy module e.g. numpy.zeros, numpy.uint8, etc. I get the error codeUndefined variable from importcode.p  pThe functions work fine in the python interpreter or actually running a python script. The problem is Eclipse recognizing the module functions. Ive had no trouble adding other such modules. All of the modules Im using come from the a hrefhttpwww.lfd.uci.edugohlkepythonlibs relnofollowunofficial windows binariesa. Once Ive installed them, Ive simply added the modules directory to the Eclipse interpreter libraries to get them to work. This has been unsuccessful for numpy. Ive even tried adding each of the subfolders of the numpy package to the interpreter libraries. Ive checked the import in the interpreter using a verbose run of Python to see what all happens during the import, but I dont see much that I havent already tried added to the Eclipse interpreter libraries. I attempted using earlier versions of numpy and the version from the official numpy site as well, but with the same result. I tried adding the numpy directory to the project PYTHONPATH specifically as well, but with no success there either.p  pIm using Windows 7, Python 2.7, and 64bit versions of all the packages and python.p  pAny suggestions Thank you muchp

Negative 365 pIm trying to convert the notes attached to an Open Document Presentation file to text, using odfpy.

Negative 365 pI searched and couldnt find a solution to this maybe Im using the wrong terms, and I feel a bit silly because I believe Im overlooking something simple. Heres what Id like to dop  pI have an object in my game that needs to travel a specific x distance in a specified number of frames. But, Id like to have it ease into the target point instead of moving the same distancevelocity every frame.p  pSo rather than just dividing the number of frames by the distance, and applying that velocity each frame, Id Id like to slowly ease itself into the target coordinate strongin a specified number of framesstrong.p  pSo for example Im terrible at explaining, perhaps an example could help... say I have a spaceship, and he needs to travel 32 pixels to the right. Id like to input a value that specifies hell travel 32 pixels in... say, 4 frames. In a linear system, hed travel 8 pixels each frame, but I want him to ease into it, so maybe on frame 1 and Im using completely random values hed move 16 pixels, frame 2 hed move 10, frame 3 hed move 4, and frame 4 hed move 2, and hell end up traveling the 32 pixels distance in those 4 frames, slowly easing into the target point.p  pThe first thing that came to mind was using exponentlogarithms somehow, but Id like some suggestions. Any help would be greatly appreciated, thanks Dp

Negative 365 pHas anyone tried to implement pessimistic locking on GAE On my project there are some tasks that have to be mutually exclusive. I have done this by usingp  precodejavax.persistence.EntityManager.findentityClass, primaryKey, LockModeType.PESSIMISTICREAD codepre  pwhich queries DB using SELECT FOR UPDATE and which works well ... as long as there is only one application instance that is processing the requests. If there were more instances my requests would be processed partially concurrently.p  pI have tested this by adding a sleep of 10 seconds inside of my mutually exclusive method. For one instance 6 requests were processed in about 60 seconds but for 3 instances sometimes 20 sometimes 30 but never 60 seconds.p  pDoes it mean CloudSQL does not replicate Locks among SQL instances Is there any other way to implement pessimistic locking on a table row  p  pBr Marekp

I also tried to follow the flow of the JVM through the methods using the eclipse debugger, but the steps throught the methods are at some points a bit to fast.p  pI already got, that p  precodeY y  new Z codepre  pcreates the new instance of the Z class and assign it to a reference of the Y class. Since there is no constructor in Z, the compiler looks in each superclass whether there is an constructor, and in case there isnt one, it uses the constructor of the object class. After that thep  precodey.a codepre  pmethod is called. There is no such a method in class Z, so again we end up at class X where method a exists and execute it. First we execute method b which, because your object is an instance of class Z, and the method b is overwritten in class Z leads to the outputp  precodeb from class Z. codepre  pAfter that the method c is called in method a. Since our instance is still an instance from class Z and there exists a method c in this class you could come up with the idea that the outputp  precodec from class Z codepre  pwill occur. But this is no true, because the c method in class X is a private method. Since its private it cant be inherited to subclasses it even cant be seen. So there is no need that any class inheriting from X also has the c method. Is it true, that because of that the call of c from method a leads to a call to the c method in class X rather than in class Zp  pSo recapitulating Is my explanation from above correct or am I missing anything I just a little bit confused, that although my instance is from class Z, calling method c from inside method a leads to the following resultp  precodeb from class Z c from class X codepre  pMy first idea was that the output looks likep  precodeb from class Z c from class Z codepre  pHopefully I described the problem in a way somebody can help me now. Thank you for all replies.p

Negative 365 pFor the last week I have been finding the following two intermittent exception on our web serversp  precodeSystem.Security.Cryptography.CryptographicException Insufficient system resources exist to complete the requested service.

My custom view draws keyboard chords and this work when I show them on a FragmentActivity, with ViewPager, etc. I did as I had done before, created a XML file as a list item and implemented a class extending from ArrayAdapter. When I inflate an XML file, it works just fine, but its not working when I use my custom view class, that doesnt have a xml file. Do you guys have any clue My code is below.

Negative 365 pIm trying to write a Roman Numeral Converter for php practice that has an input page where the user specifies whether their input is Roman or Numeric, writes the input, and hits submit.

Negative 365 pUsing reflection, Ive managed to invoke the main method of another java application that uses swing to create windows. Ive also been able to grab those windows and manipulate them. When I get to a certain point, I loop through the actionListeners of a certain JMenuItem and I call their actionPerformed telling them the button has been pressed. This works exactly as intended, and opens a new window. When this window opens, however, I want to do something similar to it by first getting the window and then the components inside of it.p  pHowever, as soon as the event is fired, the window is created and my program is put in a busy loop waiting for the window I want to interact with to close. This is caused by the application I am invoking, and I have no control over this, nor do I have an opportunity to do anything about it.br Heres how I am doing that event firing  p  pcodefor ActionListener a  nc.getActionListeners      a.actionPerformednew ActionEventnc, ActionEvent.ACTIONPERFORMED,null  code  p  pWhat Im thinking is I might want to have another thread thats looking for the window, but Im not even sure if that will work..p

Negative 365 pI am implementing an endpoint in my Flask application that receives a collection of HTTP requests, and returns a collection of the corresponding HTTP responses. In order to accomplish this, I need my endpoint to call other endpoints in order to construct the result. However, because Flask is blocking while processing the original request, it cannot process the nested requests and the application gets deadlocked.p  pIs there any way to issue a request within a request in flask in a way that doesnt result in a deadlockp  pI included a segment of my code which I believe should be enough to illustrate the problem without overwhelming you.

Instead, just call the function that is mapped to the endpoint of interest urlfor. I am unsatisfied by this approach because the nested requests have their own headers and cookies which are neglected by this approach. Furthermore, code in the beforerequest  and afterrequest handlers wont get called automaticallypli lipRun multiple instances of the application. This will solve the problem, but expose my service to a pretty simple DoS attack. If I have X instances running, All an attacker would need to do is to hit my service with X different requests to cause a deadlock.pli ol  pThank you.p

Negative 365 pIm currently working on a HTML5 webapp served by Djangoapache.p  pThe apps goal is to monitor a couple of devices  all the clientside logic is written with Angular and all the data comes from JSONbased RESTlike calls made to the backend pretty common stuff I assume.p  pThis is working rather well, so far. Now Id like to implement a notification system emsomething that would react to external events and would notify all the running webapp instances that something needs to be refreshed on the pageem. I really dont want all instances to just poll the server because that seems suboptimal. Especially on mobile devices where this would likely drain the battery quickly.p  pI have very little experience with this kind of stuff Im more of a backend developer, so this is all pretty new to me. I was first thinking of making a longlived HTTP request from the Javascript side to the server this request would only give a result after either a timeout period in which case the client would have to retry and wait again, right away or after something changed it would then reply with some information about models that needs to be refreshed.p  pThis seems like it could work in theory, but I figured Id rather ask first because it seems so common, I would be surprised if no framework existed for this kind of task.p  h3So my question is is there a defacto standardtechnology to use in such cases andor what would you recommend to implement it h3  pThe server is running in a VM over which I have a strongtotal controlstrong meaning I can install whatever software I need to implement that. Id like to avoid having to use several network ports as much as possible but if it makes things really easier, then its fine.p

Negative 365 pI have been using BOOST Test Library to perform unit test on different platforms such as Windows, Linux and MAC. But on IOS, if I still use the same unit test suite that have been used on Windows, Linux and MAC, it will fail. If I understand well about IOS, it is impossible to build an executable command line program that can run on IOS. While the unit test program that can run on Windows, Linux and MAC is a command line program. Moreover, the way how IOS handles the path is very different. I understand on IOS, people often xctest to perform the testing. I just wondering whether it is still possible to use BOOST Test library for unit test on IOS with xcode 4. Any ideas will be appreciated. p

Negative 365 pFunctional tests, unlike unit tests, cannot often be naturally isolated as each test usually requires the state after the execution of the previous one.p  pFor example to test basic CRUD operations like entity deletion or updating it must first be created. While we can prevent code duplication by extracting the code of entity creation into a separate method, it is unclear how to deal with repetition of calling entity creation test or any other dependent tests. And as the number of tests grows these repeated calls significantly degrade time execution and readability.p  pAn intuitive solution would be to merge all these interdependent tests into a single one, but it makes harder to localize a bug.p  pThe information I have read so far was mostly about unit testing and I think it does not perfectly fit the needs for functionalacceptance and especially web browser testing.p  pTo be specific, currently I am using JUnit tests interacting with the webapp with inmemory database via Selenium WebDriver API. p  pWhat best practicals some would recommend for this problemp

Negative 365 pWe currently have a solution were we are having more and more the need to store unstructured data of various kinds. For example clients have the ability to define their own workflows where they define what kind of data should be captured of various types...some simple some complex. This data then needs to be stored and are then displayed on a web application with a bit of functionality to modify the data.p  pUntil now the workflows have been defined internally and therefore a MS SQL database was designed to cater for these specific workflows and their data. However now that clients have the ability to define workflows we need to relax the structure of our db. At first I thought that a key value table in ms sql might be a good idea but obviously I loose the typeness of the data being capture and then need to deserialize all the data in websiteMVC.NET.  I am also considering something like raven db but are not sure if this would be a good fitp  pSo my question  is thus what would be the best way to store this unstructured data bearing in mind users must be able to search and editdisplay this data as wellp

Negative 365 pThere are similar questions about importing an intentionally shadowed module into a shadowing module which is strongnotstrong in codesys.pathcode. Thats pretty easy just usep  precodefrom future import absoluteimport codepre  pHeres my problem my module strongisstrong in codesys.pathcode, strongandstrong its higher up in codesys.pathcode, strongandstrong thats intentionalp  pTo be more specific, Im writing a python interpreter which lacks access to codestdincode, but it can use codeTkintercode. Not having access to codestdincode means I cant just use normal codeinputcode, coderawinputcode, and codegetpasscode. I need to replace those with my own methods. The first two are rather easy to handle  I just replace them in codebuiltincode. codegetpasscode isnt as easy though  the user may or may not import it, but when they do, I need to make sure that what they actually import is my module, not the standard one, so that I can get their input through a codeTkintercode codeEntrycode instead of codestdincode. That part I have handled. The part that I cant figure out is how to pass everything else through to the standard codegetpasscode, IE, codegetusercode should be handled by the real codegetpasscode.p  pHeres what I triedp  precodefrom future import absoluteimport import sys pathToThisGetpass  sys.path.pop1     I know that the shadowing getpass is at index 1. import getpass as realGetpass           Since the path doesnt contain this getpass, this should be the real one, right sys.path.insert1, pathToThisGetpass   Put this getpass module back into the path again  def getuser     printI am   strgetuser     printI should call   strrealGetpass.getuser     return realGetpass.getuser codepre  pI added in those two print statements just so I could see why codegetusercode was failing, and I found that it would print thisp  precodeI am ltfunction getuser at 0x026D8A30gt I should call ltfunction getuser at 0x026D8A30gt codepre  pPlus I end up with infinite recursion.p  pSo... any ideas how I can resolve thisp  pTo try reproducing this, write a file like the one I have above, name it codegetpass.pycode, then add the folder that contains it to your codesys.pathcode, then runp  precodeimport getpass getpass.getuser codepre

Negative 365 pI am currently testing phalcon php for a project, and I am looking for a way to automatically inject certain classes automatically based on an implemented interface.p  pa hrefhttpdocs.phalconphp.comenlatestreferencedi.html relnofollowThe Dependency Injection referencea has an example where if a class implements codePhalconDIInjectionAwareInterfacecode, it will automatically inject the DI into that class.p  pWhat I want to do is similar. If a class has for instance codeAraneaDbDbAdapterAwarecode, it should automatically inject the DbAdapter in that class. I am looking for something similar to what Zend Framework 2 does a hrefhttpsjuriansluiman.nlarticle121interfaceinjectionwithinitializersinzendservicemanager relnofollowhttpsjuriansluiman.nlarticle121interfaceinjectionwithinitializersinzendservicemanagera, where during DI config you can specify initializers like thisp  precodeinitializers gt array                    logger gt functionservice, sm          if service instanceof LoggerAwareInterface              logger  smgtgetlogger             servicegtsetLoggerlogger               , codepre  pIf this is not automatically possible in PhalconPHP, I was thinking of overriding the codeFactoryDefaultcode class and implement it myself.

Negative 365 pI am currently developping a platform with a PHP framework for our client.brp  pThe head of the clients IT department wants us to handle authentication with one database field containing emailpasswordsalt hashed so there isnt a plain text email field in this table and the password is more secure his reasoning. The user should be able to login with his email address and password. So the email address serves as the username.br p The idea behind this is that the email addresses of the users are very important for the business of our client and the IT head wants to obscure the email address in the login table in case of a possible attack. e.g. a hacker gets access to the login tablep This is of course only possbile, because the hashed email adress for the login is linked to his email address in the profile table.p  pBasically there are two tables which are required for this process to work. The tables are in the same database of course.br One login table with the hash combination field email, pw, salt and one profile table which contains among other things the email in plaintext in one field. Lets call it profileemail.p  pI have strongly recommended not to use this solution, because I have never before heard of this and I have already identified some possible problems with this solution.p  pSo my questions are Is this a safe and feasible solution Can you think of any unforeseeable problems Have you heard of similar solutionsp

Negative 365 pI am stuck on a database problem for a client, wandering if someone could help me out. I am currently trying to implement filtering functionality so that a user can filter results after they have searched for something. We are using SQL Server 2008. I am working on an electronics ecommerce site and the database is quite large 500,000 plus records. The scenario is this  user goes to our website and types in laptop and clicks search. This brings up the first page of several thousand results. What I want to do is then filter these results further and present the user with options such asp  h2Filter By Manufacturerh2  pDell 10,000br Acer 2,000br Lenovo 6,000p  h2Filter By Colourh2  pBlack 7000br Silver 2000p  pThe main columns of the database are like this  the primary key is an integer IDp  pbID    Title  Manufacturer    Colourbp  pThe key part of the question is how to get the counts in various categories in an efficient manner. The only way I currently know how to do it is with separate queries. However, should we wish to filter by further categories then this will become very slow  especially as the database grows. My current SQL is thisp  precodeselect count as ManufacturerCount, Manufacturer from [ProductDB.Product] GROUP BY Manufacturer select count as ColourCount, Colour from [ProductDB.Product] GROUP BY Colour codepre  pMy question is if I can get the results as a single table using somekind of join or union and if this would be faster than my current method of issuing multiple queries with the Count function. Thanks for your help, if you require any further information please ask. PS I am wandering how on sites like ebay and amazon manage to do this so fast. In order to understand my problem better if you go onto ebay and type in laptop you will see a number of filters on the left  this is basically what I am trying to achieve. I dont know how it can be done efficiently when there are many filters. E.g to get functionality equivalent to Ebay I would need about 10 queries and Im sure that will be slow. I was thinking of creating an intermediate table with all the counts however the intermediate table would have to be continuously updated in order to reflect changes to the database and that would be a problem if there are multiple updates per minute. Thanks.p

I then use grep i to match it with the correct folder containing the TV Show in the Plex Library folder and use the rest of the showepisode number to put the file in the right place. Funny enough, one of the shows Marvels Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. in fact happens to come with periods in its name.p  pIs there an easy way to match together the file name and the plex folder name without having the underscore problem described abovep  pOr should I simply set an exception for this particular showp

Then in the create action for article, check to see if the title or description contains any of the saved keywords.p  pThis sounds good but will probably fall over once any reasonable amount of users are added.p  pObviously, a background task would do the trick but it still sounds wrong to do a basic string contains directly on the database.p  pPerhaps I could tokenize the title and description into an index and use a background process to handle the heavy lifting I heard Postgres has some built in text search  could this work Could I use a Heroku addon like Solr or Redis to handle all this or is it overkill Not having to pay for an addon is an advantage. Perhaps someone has a better implementation for the same functionality.p  pI know I can implement it quickly, I just want to be sure it implementation is up to scratch.p  pThanks, Brianp

Negative 365 pI would like to implement a similar response system for push notifications throughout my app. When a remote notification appears and the application is in the active state I would like to place a button temporarily on the screen that performs the same action regardless of where it is in the app.  The only way I can think to do this is to create the same response to notification method in each of the apps many view controller.  Is there any way to do this in the app delegate, tab bar, or navigation bar so that the same response would apply to multiple views rather than placing the same function in each view controller separately Please advise and thanks p

Negative 365 pMaybe I wasnt searching the documentation properly, but what is the recommended standard way of treating authorisation levelsclassification for admin users in firebase p  pLets say in classic admin user scenario, where admin should have the access to all user accounts while normal authenticated users have write access to only specific objects.p  pI came accross a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions17607101firebaseauthenticateasadminthis posta but the solution using firebase secret is not good enough in this case. Firebase secret is meant to be used by server and setting up the extra server authenticating admin users and talking to firebase is certainly the option, but the complexity and programming overhead is increased.p  pa hrefhttpstackoverflow.coma229249082232045The better optiona is using the security rules. Question here is  Does not this generate an extra overhead for each single readwrite operation The number of general users could be in millions while there is only handful of admins. Secondly you do not want non admin to be authenticated by management tool even though they will not be authorised to do anything.p  pThird option  however I dont know how would I achieve this  limit authentication to admin interface webapp only to specific admin users or set the limit for the specific domain. Lets say only namemyappadmin.com will be allowed to be authenticated thus I will not need to do the authorisation check before each operation.  Is this even possible using only Firebase as backendp

Negative 365 pHere is what im trying to do. I have an .svg image that I made to have a transparent background and is otherwise completely white. I wish to render the image to a QImage and then I want to adjust the hue of the image so that I can change the color to match the interface at any time, and then I will adjust the saturation and value whenever it is moused over or clicked on. I have successfully rendered the image to a QImage like sop  precodeQSvgRenderer rendererTAGDELETEICONPATH mTagDeleteImage  QImagemMetric.height, mMetric.height, QImageFormatARGB32 mTagDeleteImage.fill0x00000000  QPainter painterampmTagDeleteImage painter.setRenderHintQPainterAntialiasing renderer.renderamppainter codepre  pwhere mTagDeleteImage is a QImage, TAGDELETEICONPATH is a valid path to the icon, and mMetric is a font metric to a valid font. Yes the height and width are both supposed to be the height of the font. This all happens in the constructor, and is then drawn to the widget in the paint function. If I leave it at this, the white image with proper transparency is drawn without issue. Now I just need to change the hue, value, and saturation of the image. The documentation seemed pretty thorough, although apparently missing some key details, and so I try to adjust each pixel in the image like sop  precodeQSvgRenderer rendererTAGDELETEICONPATH mTagDeleteImage  QImagemMetric.height, mMetric.height, QImageFormatARGB32 mTagDeleteImage.fill0x00000000  QPainter painterampmTagDeleteImage painter.setRenderHintQPainterAntialiasing renderer.renderamppainter  forint x  0 x lt mTagDeleteImage.width x      forint y  0 y lt mTagDeleteImage.height y              QColor currentmTagDeleteImage.pixelx, y         QRgb newPixel  qRgbaTAGDELETEICONCOLOR.red, TAGDELETEICONCOLOR.green,                               TAGDELETEICONCOLOR.blue, current.alpha          mTagDeleteImage.setPixelx, y, newPixel       codepre  pwhere TAGDELETEICONCOLOR is a valid QColor already set to the hsv I want. Right now its white against the blue background of another widget so its very visible. When I did these, even though you see that I tried to retain the current alpha value and only change the value, all I get is a completely white square where my image originally was, alpha apparently being completely ignored. Since it is a fairly small QImage, like 16 x 16, I decided to print the value of each pixel like thisp  precodeforint x  0 x lt mTagDeleteImage.width x      forint y  0 y lt mTagDeleteImage.height y              QColor currentmTagDeleteImage.pixelx, y         qDebug ltlt pixel  ltlt mTagDeleteImage.width  x  y ltlt                    ltlt current.red ltlt   ltlt current.green ltlt                    ltlt current.blue ltlt   ltlt current.alpha       codepre  pand it definately showed that all pixels in the image were completely white and completely opaque , 255, 255, 255, 255. Just to make sure that I was getting the current pixel correctly, I performed the same print statement, but immediately after I cleared the image like sop  precodeQSvgRenderer rendererTAGDELETEICONPATH mTagDeleteImage  QImagemMetric.height, mMetric.height, QImageFormatARGB32 mTagDeleteImage.fill0x00000000  forint x  0 x lt mTagDeleteImage.width x      forint y  0 y lt mTagDeleteImage.height y              QColor currentmTagDeleteImage.pixelx, y         qDebug ltlt pixel  ltlt mTagDeleteImage.width  x  y ltlt                    ltlt current.red ltlt   ltlt current.green ltlt                    ltlt current.blue ltlt   ltlt current.alpha       codepre  pand then I discovered the issue. Even though all the pixels are supposed to be completely transparent at this point rgba 0, 0, 0, 0, every pixel is reporting back rgba 0, 0, 0, 255. The image format is set to QImageFormatARGB32 so it should definitely respect the alpha channel. Ive verified that mTagDeleteImage.hasAlphaChannel does return true. So can anyone tell what is going on p  pI will pastebin if you need more code.p  pEDIT Changed the linep  precodemTagDeleteImage.fill0x0000000 codepre  ptop  precodemTagDeleteImage.fillQColor0, 0, 0, 0 codepre  pNo change.   p
Negative 365 pI am creating a web application using Servlets and JPA. I have a user table that stores usernames,passwords and roles. I would like to create Login and user registration functionality for these users so that some of my content is accessible to certain users. As I ready through the Servlet specification and also Tomcat, which is the container I use, I have come across two ways of defining users and roles of the system.p  pThe Tomcat specification suggests I can use Realms to tie into another database so that I can choose to use SSO if I wish.  Servlets have their own way of defining users and roles using the web.xml, such as basic authentication for example, so does the Servlet container, using Realms.p  pBut to create users and roles in the Servlet and the Container seems to be something that the system administrator would do. What I am looking for is a selfregistration.p  pThis question above highlights my confusion with these approaches, I dont know if the way I want to proceed is correct or secure Can someone explain the differences between these methods of authentication Why choose one over the other Is my plan to use the self registration a bad idea  or insecure for J2E Modelp

So each skill gets its own formp  precodeclass PublicController lt ApplicationController    def index     skills  Skill.all   end end codepre  ppublicindex Viewp  precodelt skills.groupbyampyeargroupname.each do key, value gt   lt key gt     lt value.groupbyampelementname.each do keyone, valueone gt       lt keyone gt         lt valueone.each do s gt               lt document  currentuser.documents.whereskillid s.id  gt              lt s.skilldescription gt                lt if document gt                  lt document.each do doc gt                    lt doc gt                  lt end gt                                        lt render template documentsnew gt               lt else gt                   lt render template documentsnew gt               lt end gt          lt end gt      lt end gt  codepre  pdocumentsnewp  precodelt object  document  Document.new gt   ltif object.errors.any gt     lth2gtlt pluralizeobject.errors.count, error gt prohibited this record from being savedlth2gt       ltul classerrorlistgt         lt object.errors.fullmessages.each do msg gt           ltligtlt erroreditmsg gtltligt           lt end gt       ltulgt   lt end gt  lt formfor object, html gt  multipart true, id object.objectid.tos, class uploaddocument  do f gt    lt f.hiddenfield skillid, class skillid gt    lt f.label media gt    lt f.filefield media gt    lt f.submit Upload gt lt end gt codepre  pSo at the moment i am using the objectid to return the integer identifier of the object. Whilst this does give me a unique id for each form, they do change when validation fails as a new object is renderedp  pI have thought of two possible ways of covering this,p  p1 if an object exists so instance of document then use its id 2 if its a new instance, assign the Skill id that the form is within.p  pThis way the id would stay consistent even when validation fails..p  pI am having some trouble implementing this though, I cant seem to access the Skill.id within my formfor and as for codedocumentcode assigning it like this throws codeunable to find document with id codep  precodeclass PublicController lt ApplicationController    def index     skills  Skill.all     document  Document.findparams[id]   end codepre  pThere has been one scenario where I have been able to assign the document.id to a form that has a record, but i have had to hardcode it, which is obviously no goodp  pScenario 1p  precodeclass PublicController lt ApplicationController    def index     skills  Skill.all     document  Document.find1   end  lt formfor object, html gt  multipart true, id object.id, class uploaddocument  do f gt codepre  pSo this assigns the id of 1 to all my forms.p  pIf anyone has any advicepointers they can give they would be much appreciatedp  pThanksp
Negative 365 pI am trying to add a wav header on top of raw PCM data to make it playable via AVAudioPlayer. But i couldnt find any solution or source code to do that on iOS using ObjectiveCSwift. Though i found a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions24772844convertapcmfloatbuffertoawavnsdatathisa but it doesnt have correct answer.p  pBut i found a piece of code a hrefhttpwww.pceworld.comview19897879 relnofollowherea which is in C and also contains some issue. The wav file doesnt play properly which is generated from that code. p  pI have given my codes below which i have coded so far.p  precodeint NumChannels  AUDIOCHANNELSPERFRAME short BitsPerSample  AUDIOBITSPERCHANNEL int SamplingRate  AUDIOSAMPLERATE int numOfSamples  [[NSData dataWithContentsOfFilefilePath] length]  int ByteRate  NumChannelsBitsPerSampleSamplingRate8 short BlockAlign  NumChannelsBitsPerSample8 int DataSize  NumChannelsnumOfSamplesBitsPerSample8 int chunkSize  16 int totalSize  36  DataSize short audioFormat  1  iffout  fopen[wavFilePath cStringUsingEncoding1], w  NULL      printfError opening out file    fwriteRIFF, sizeofchar, 4,fout fwriteamptotalSize, sizeofint, 1, fout fwriteWAVE, sizeofchar, 4, fout fwritefmt , sizeofchar, 3, fout fwriteampchunkSize, sizeofint,1,fout fwriteampaudioFormat, sizeofshort, 1, fout fwriteampNumChannels, sizeofshort,1,fout fwriteampSamplingRate, sizeofint, 1, fout fwriteampByteRate, sizeofint, 1, fout fwriteampBlockAlign, sizeofshort, 1, fout fwriteampBitsPerSample, sizeofshort, 1, fout fwritedata, sizeofchar, 3, fout fwriteampDataSize, sizeofint, 1, fout codepre  pThe file is playing too fast, the sound is distorted and only first 10 to 20around seconds are playing.

Negative 365 pI am trying to put a timeconstrained semaphore into a sql database. The lock shall provide mutual exclusion on write access to a data table, but concerning only a certain FK value email, which is why I cant use table locks or similar. And since I dont trust the sql connection to hold or the lock to be released in all cases of course we try, but better safe than sorry, the lock shall time out after 3 minutes if it is not renewed or released in between.p  pUp to now, I have the following SQL statementp  precodeUPDATE users SET lockTime  GETDATE OUTPUT DELETED.LockTime WHERE email  mail codepre  pThe problem If the user is in the table, this will always update the lockTime and return the old lockTime. So, if an orphaned lock is in effect and the query is run in 2minute intervals, the lock will never be released. For testing all the logic around it, this is okay, but not for production.p  pThe lockTime should only be updated if it is older than, say, 3 minutes. So I triedp  precodeUPDATE users SET lockTime  GETDATE OUTPUT DELETED.LockTime  WHERE email  mail AND DATEADDlockTime,3 minutesltGETDATE codepre  pBut this cant even be put into testing code, since I cant distinguish the cases email is not in DB and lock is younger than 3 minutes.p  pSo, where am I thinking wrongp

I planned to workaround this by manually setting the Region after the codecreateEntitycode call, so I added this line of code right above codecreateEntitycodep  precodevar region  Enumerable.Fromservice.regions.Single.RegionId    listValues.RegionId codepre  pHowever, after doing so, and with no other changes, codenewListcode now correctly gets a populated codeRegioncode, even for 3 USA I then commented out that line and tried again, and it still worked. Tried a few other times, various combinations of things, and now its not working again, even with that line. Not sure if that helps. Ill keep experimenting.p
Negative 365 pI have a Module abstract base class which users inherit from to create dlls for a particular program. This base class exposes an abstract method ProcessData which does some processing on data and returns the processed data. The main program iterates over all the included dlls and calls everyones ProcessData function. Kind of like thisp  precodeforeach Module module in allModules     Data newData  module.ProcessDataoldData    Do stuff with newData  codepre  pTheres a general contract that dll creators should abide by, which is that no file IO, web access, etc. should be performed in ProcessData. However, some of these user modules have bugs which occur every once in a while in which they enter an infinite loop or so I assume.p  pIf I dont know what the heck these users are doing in their functions, is there still a way to halt their function execution if its taking too long Id like my program to be robust enough to halt a modules execution if it detects that its taking far too long, since right now the process thread just gets stuck forever. Ive heard that starting a thread and then attempting Abort doesnt always work due to exception handling among other things, but if Im not in charge of the function, there must be emsomeem way for me to force it to stop. Hopefully....p

Negative 365 pAm I wrong to assume that the atomicload should also act as a memory barrier ensuring that all previous emnonatomicem writes will become visible by other threadsp  pTo illustratep  precodevolatile bool arm1  false stdatomicbool arm2  false bool triggered  false codepre  pThread1p  precodearm1  true stdstdatomicthreadfencestdmemoryorderseqcst  this would do the trick  if arm2.load     triggered  true codepre  pThread2p  precodearm2.storetrue if arm1     triggered  true codepre  pI expected that after executing both triggered would be true. Please dont suggest to make arm1 atomic, the point is to explore the behavior of atomicload.p  pWhile I have to admit I dont fully understand the formal definitions of the different relaxed semantics of a hrefhttpen.cppreference.comwcppatomicmemoryorder relnofollowmemory ordera I thought that the emsequentially consistent orderingem was pretty straightforward in that it guarantees that a single total order exists in which all threads observe all modifications in the same order. To me this implies that the stdatomicload with the default memory order of stdmemoryorderseqcst will also act as a memory fence. This is further corroborated by the following statement under Sequentiallyconsistent orderingp  pTotal sequential ordering requires a full memory fence CPU instruction on all multicore systems. p  pYet, my simple example below demonstrates this is not the case with MSVC 2013, gcc 4.9 x86 and clang 3.5.1 x86, where the atomic load simply translates to a load instruction.p  precodeinclude ltatomicgt  stdatomiclong al  ifdef WIN32 declspecnoinline else attributenoinline endif long load      return al.loadstdmemoryorderseqcst   int mainint argc, char argv[]      long r  load  codepre  pWith gcc this looks likep  precodeload    mov  rax, QWORD PTR al[rip]    lt plain load here, no fence or xchg    ret main    call load    xor  eax, eax    ret codepre  pIll omit the msvc and clang which are essentially identical.

Negative 365 pIve tried to find this answer, but am not really sure what to search for. I have some Excel macros that edit multiple sheets e.g. Copy cells from sheet 1, paste onto the end of a list on sheet 2, then put an X next to the cells on Sheet 1 and offset to the next rowp  pMy issue is that when I run the macro, it spazzes out, switching the display back and forth between sheets 1 and 2. I cant just cite a specific range e.g. sheetsSheet 1.rangec2.dosomething because the locations are changing. It wouldnt be an issue, but the other users who access the sheet arent familiar with macrosVBA, and they think something is broken.p  pIn short, the macros do what I want, but it looks really tacky. Is there a way to dynamically work across sheets without changing the displayed sheetrangep

Negative 365 pIm using a JMS strongtopicstrong with nondurable subscribers to report the emprogressem of serverside processing to the clients. The application server itself is WildFly 8.2, the clients is a JavaFX application.p  pAt every specific milestone lets say every tenths of the work done of the serverside processing a JMS message is sent to the topic, to which clients are subscribed. The idea is, when a JMS message is received, it can be used to drive a progress bar forward.p  pMy problem is, that some kind of buffering  happens somewhere in the system, presumably on the serverside. The processing itself is a longer one, 10 to 30 seconds, and the messages are sent to queue according to the logs roughly evenly, one in 13 sec. p  pHowever, on the client side the whole bunch of messages are received within a very short time frame, typically under 0.5 sec, usually at the end of the whole processing.p  pHow could I use JMS messaging to represent realtime progressp

Negative 365 pso I have a map view with annotations added as users post at different locations. I am attempting to change the pin color to Green, Red or Purple depending on how long its been since the pin was created. p  pThe issue im having here is that all of the pins want to change to one specified color rather than displaying pins with different colors. I cant seem to figure out whats going wrong here. With the example code below it is setting all the pins green, when in reality the only pins that should be green are pins created less than 4 hours ago, red pins are older than 4 hours but younger than 44 hours, and purple pins are older than 44 hours. p  pany help is appreciatedp  precodepinColorQuery.findObjectsInBackgroundWithBlock              dateCreated, error gt Void in             if error  nil                   The find succeeded.                  let createdDates  dateCreated as [PFObject]                  for date in createdDates                      let createdAt  date.createdAt as NSDate                     let currentDate  NSDate                     let expirationDate  currentDate.timeIntervalSinceDatedate.createdAt                      This is where I attempt to set the pinColor based on age of pin                     if expirationDate lt 18000                          normalPinView.pinColor  .Green                      else if expirationDate lt 162000                          normalPinView.pinColor  .Red                      else if expirationDate gt 162050                          normalPinView.pinColor  .Purple                                                      else                   Log details of the failure                 printlnError error error.userInfo                       codepre  pThe expirationDate interval is returning correctly, which I checked with a simple codeprintlnexpirationDatecode.p

Negative 365 pFirst of all, when I create a test class via CtrlShiftT, IDEA automatically puts p  precodeimport static org.junit.Assert. codepre  pinto the class. In the same time a popup dialog apperas an asks me whether to add this new file to git. By hitting yes the file is added but the import disappears. I can understand that because the unit methods are empty, just declared bodys. After implementing the test with an assert I have to manually add the static import again. That is the first behavior. The second is that after I close the file and reopen it after some time again IDEA replaces the wildcard assert import with only the asserts I used in my unit test, e. g. onlyp  precodeimport static org.junit.Assert.assertEquals import static org.junit.Assert.assertNotNull codepre  pHow can I prevent this quite annoying behavior I already tried to use a code template where I copied the template of Class and added the static import but this did not help me.p

Negative 365 pIm pretty new to IAP so this might seem a dumb question, but bear with me.p  pI just implemented IAP in my app, in such a way that its a nonconsumable and once a user buys it, they can use it on any device with the same Apple ID.

Is this going to happen once the app is deployed in the AppStore I mean, could the user use multiple accounts on my app with Premium enabled, after paying once with their AppleID. Or is it my responsibility as the provider, to match AppleIDs with each loggedin user and provide Premium features for each appuser onlyp

I have successfully initialised the device into the correct state to send and receive Isochronous data and I can see data being sent over the USB in my hardware USB analyser, but the buffers I am receiving are always unfilled even though the analyser shows that there was data in the packets sent to the PC.p  pIm new to LibUsbK and using Isochronous transfers though Im not new to USB in general but Ive been really struggling with this.p  pThe code Im using to read from the device is something like this...p  precodeUsbKSelectInterfaceusbHandle,1,0 UsbKSetAltInterfaceusbHandle,1,0,1  IsoKInitampisoCtx, ISOPACKETSPERXFER, 0 IsoKSetPacketsisoCtx, ISOPACKETSIZE  Size of each individual packet OvlKInitampovlPool, usbHandle, 4, 0 OvlKResetPipeusbHandle, 0x83 OclKAcquireampovlkHandle, ovlPool UsbKIsoReadPipeusbHandle, 0x83, inBuffer, sizeofinBuffer, ovlkHandle, isoCtx  whilefinished      ifOvlKIsCompleteovlkHandle              fwriteinBuffer, sizeofinBuffer, 1, outFile         memsetinBuffer,0xcc,sizeofinBuffer         OvlKReUseovlkHandle         UsbKIsoReadPipeusbHandle, 0x83, inBuffer, sizeofinBuffer, ovlkHandle, isoCtx       codepre  pIf I put a breakpoint at the fwrite line then the inBuffer is always full of 0xCC  ie, not having been filled by the iso read.p  pIve checked all the error return values from the UsbKOvlK function calls and they are all as they should be.  Ive checked my buffers are sufficiently big to receive the data.p  pI use very similar code to write to the ISO out pipe on endpoint 0x02 and that works perfectly, the only difference really between the code above and my write code is that the fwritememset commands are replaced with a call to a fillbuffer function that populates my outBuffer before calling UsbKIsoWritePipe function.p  pI tried looking through any examples I could find in the samples and also online but struggled to understandget them to work with my particular device.p  pAny suggestions or help greatly appreciated.p
Negative 365 pI have a public class codeAcode. This class would be used at both client as well as server side. But at the server end it would have lesser APIs exposed client environment specific APIs would not be present.  So, I am extracting the core APIs common to both the environments into an abstract hidden super class codeASupercode. That is splitting codeAcode into codeAcode and codeASupercode. br The problem I am facing in doing this is that many of the core APIs return object of type codeltT extends Agtcode. Hence, a superclass is referring its subclass which is against principles of inheritance. I dont want to override each such API in A due to large number of these APIs. I dont want to change methods signature to codeltT extends ASupergtcode either. Can someone help me with thisp

Negative 365 pIve got this issue with a query in SSIS. From a table in SQL Server Im getting over 25000 different identifiers. These identifier are associated to many values in a table in  one Oracle Database. This is the schema that I have implemented for doing this. p  pa hrefhttpi.stack.imgur.com9UJRz.jpg relnofollowimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.com9UJRz.jpg altenter image description hereap  pThe problem is that some days the identifiers can be over 45000, and at this point perform a loop for every one is not the best solution It can take to much time to get the result. Previously I have performed another query where from the SQL statement, I am creating and sending a unique row with all the values concatenated and then I have recover this unique string from an object and use it to create the query in the ODBC Source that invoke the table in Oracle something like thisp  pSelect  from Oracletable  stringvaluesp  pwith stringvalues  where value in ......... It works good because the number of values is small enough to be used, like 250. But in this case I can not use this approach because the number is really big and obviously the DBA of Oracle is going to cancel the query.p  pSo I wonder, how can I iterate over the object getting only a few number of values everytime, something like 300 or maximun 500, to avoid the cancelation of the query but at the same time doing the minimun number of loops. Or if there another solution to this question I would appreciate your help.p

Negative 365 pI am trying to deserialize text into an object with XMLRPC.NET. There are methods to serializedeserialize XMLRPC request and response. I have been struggling however to figure out how to take XmlRpcResponse [for example, which can be constructed with XmlRpcSerializerDeserializeResponse] and make it an XmlRpcStruct object. Perhaps there is a way to Deserialize xml text or document directly into XmlRpcStruct. I see that XmlRpcStruct.cs code imports serialization classes. If you understand the Cook XmlRpc library, I would certainly appreciate any pointers.p  pThank youp

Negative 365 pIm not a database expert, so Im not sure how to ask this question briefly and succinctly. I am trying to copy data with the following characteristics many of the tables with data being copied contain references to other tables with data being copied i.e., a patient might attend a class where their weight is recorded, so I need to copy both the class attendance row as well as the weight value stored in another table, which is referenced by the class attendance row. There are other, even more complex, examples in this database, but it seems that I need to perform some kind of recursive copy of these interreferenced items so I can maintain the crossreferences in the copied data.p  pSo, is there any kind of standard approach to this problem If there isnt a direct answer, could someone share the terminology of what Im trying to do so that I can look it up on my own Im certain this problem has been tackled many times before, but I dont know how to find the solution. I understand the basic concepts of JOINs and FKs, but this solution seems to require a way to copy the rows from various tables while also going back and updating the crossreferences in some cases, these are FKs, and in other cases, they are not Im stuck with the schema as it is.p  pPS If its such an obvious solution, why wont anyone just provide it or characterize it below so we can move on Most of humanity is capable of asking the occasional dumb question, and this may very well be one of mine, but Im seriously stuck on this one and would appreciate some assistance.p  pHeres a sketch of a small part of the schema to try to illustrate the issue a hrefhttpi.stack.imgur.comBDznI.png relnofollowimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comBDznI.png altenter image description hereap  pWhen we copy a patients data record, we need to 1 create a new row in patient 2 create a corresponding new row in edclasssessionlabs 3 create a new row in patientlabweight and heres what I see as the tricky part 4 also update the reference in edclasssessionlabs to the new row in patientlabweight.

Negative 365 pSo in a typical workflow of a developer, it goes something like thisp  pYou sync your workspace to some changeset, do some work, shelve changes youve made.p  pMy question is, internally, when you create a shelveset, does TFS keep track of which changeset the changes are based on If so, is there a way to look this upp  pMy rudimentary understanding is that, yes, this changeset information must be somehow recorded because shelvesets are stored internally as deltas, as opposed to full copies of files and without a record of which changeset the delta is based on, a delta is basically useless.p

Negative 365 pIn my application I want to use log4cplus for logging, having a root logger with some appenders  you get it with codeLoggergetRootcode and having some derived loggers with different appenders  you get them with codeLoggergetInstancesomeNamecode. Of course if you log to derived Loggers, say with  codeLOG4CPLUSDEBUG LoggergetInstancesomeName, Some log messagecode  this is also passed to the appenders of the root logger but not the other way round. Now I want to set up the root logger with its appenders in the main application and create derived loggers in dlls. However to make log4cplus work, I need to link against log4cplusUD.lib for both the dll and the exe and place log4cpusUD.dll in the directory of my generated exe. This way, as soon as one of my dlls is loaded, the program crashes because of log4cplus. If I would build log4cplus as a static library, my dlls and my main application wouldnt work together with the mechanism of derived loggers either. So is there a solution Any help is very much appreciated.p
