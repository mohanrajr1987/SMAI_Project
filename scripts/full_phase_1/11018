Positive 11018 pIm implementing Google Charts and providing the option to export them to PDF or Word.  In order to achieve this, I am calling the getImageURI method after each chart is drawn.

Negative 11018 pThis is a very urgent problem and Id be forever indebted to anyone who can lend some insight.p  pIm going to be deploying a widget called the ISM to a thirdparty site. That site uses the document.domain JavaScript property to relax crossdomain restrictions e.g., setting document.domain in a.example.com and b.example.com to both example.com so they can access each others DOMs.p  pThis causes problems with my script in Internet Explorer due to the way that I construct an ltiframegt that is used to display my widgets HTML content. In Internet Explorer, using document.domain on a page, and then creating an ltiframegt with JavaScript, will cause you to be immediately locked out of the ltiframegt  i.e., you can create it, but its not created in the correct document.domain, so youre not able to access its DOM due to security restrictions. This isnt a problem in any other browser.p  pTo see what Im talking about, load this page in IEp  pa hrefhttptroy.onespot.comstatic3263stage1.html relnofollowhttptroy.onespot.comstatic3263stage1.htmlap  pYou should see a JavaScript error Access is denied.p  pTo get around this, Im setting the dynamically created ltiframegts src attribute to load a static HTML file thats hosted in the same domain different subdomain, and setting its document.domain property to the appropriate valuep  pa hrefhttptroy.onespot.comstatic3263stage2.html relnofollowhttptroy.onespot.comstatic3263stage2.htmlap  pThat gets around the security issue, and lets me write the document I originally wanted to write to the ltiframegtp  pa hrefhttptroy.onespot.comstatic3263stage3.html relnofollowhttptroy.onespot.comstatic3263stage3.htmlap  pWith that document in place, my widget does some polling to our server to get some HTML content that I want to insert into another ltiframegt, which will be visible to visitors of the parent page. Ive roughly simulated that here using static content, not actually contacting our serverp  pa hrefhttptroy.onespot.comstatic3263stage4.html relnofollowhttptroy.onespot.comstatic3263stage4.htmlap  pHere comes the problem. When I get that HTML content and insert it into the second ltiframegt, I now face an unusual issue with a broken Back button. This happens in Firefox 3.0 and all version of IE possibly other browsers, though it does not happen in some browsers Ive tested Firefox 3.5, Safari, Chrome. See this pagep  pa hrefhttptroy.onespot.comstatic3263stage5.html relnofollowhttptroy.onespot.comstatic3263stage5.htmlap  pIf you click the Google link, all seems fine. But, when navigating back to the previous page that has the latter test script, another JavaScript error is introduced Permission denied. This does not terminate the script, and does not appear to have any ill effects, other than the fact that I assume its connected to the broken Back button functionality, which is a very big problem  the one Im desperately trying to solve. Im at a loss to debug this error since its call stack starts and stops in the jQuery script.p  pYou can also encounter this error  with more serious symptoms  by going to the last link above stage5.html  clear your browser cache first. Click the Stage 5 Again link, then, after that page has loaded, click the Back button.p  pThe Back button is completely broken You cant go anywhere except to another URL.p  pThis is the problem that I need to solve as soon as possible. Any insights or help would be emextremelyem appreciatedp  pI cant deviate from this method too much, so outsidethebox suggestions are definitely welcome, but I may not be able to use them due to the constraints of the widgets specifications. I would prefer to understand why the Back button is breaking and how to fix it, along with the Permission denied error related to jQuery.p

Negative 11018 pI have a custom component that extends a panel. The panel has a top tool bar with a basic config. I want to be able to add items to the panel dynamically after it has been created.p  pThose items should always come at the end of the main set of menu items and before the filler that pushes the logout button to the far right, so I wrote the insertMenuItem function to grab the position of the shunt the tbfill item and insert the new toolbar item at this location. If it doesnt find the shunt, because its been overridden, it just adds to the end of the toolbar.p  pThis seems to work just great.  If I look at the live contentPanel I can see the inserted menu item. The problem come with getting it to display.

Negative 11018 pI am working with a memory manager that, on occasion, wants to defragment memory. Basically, I will go through a list of objects allocated by the memory manager and relocate themp  precodeclass A    SomeClass data  This member is allocated by the special manager   for... each instance of A ...      a.data  memorymanager.relocatea.data codepre  pcodememorymanager.relocatecode will codememcpycode the contents of data to a new location, and return the pointer.p  pAlthough its generally not idiomatic to codememcpycode C classes, it seems to be a useful solution in this case, considering that I control the implementation of the few classes that will be used with the memory manager. p  pThe problem is that one of those classes uses codestdmapcode, which is an opaque class as far as I am concerned. I certainly dont imagine I can codememcpycode it. I may not be able to use stdmap in any case. For all I know it could allocate several pieces of memory.p  pThe best workaround I can think of is simple enough. Due to the fact that the fragmented memory manager will put new allocations at more beneficial locations, all I need to do is allocate it anew and then delete the oldp  precodefor... each instance of A ...      stlmapltsomethinggt tmp  a.themap     a.themap  new stlmapltsomethinggttmp     delete tmp  codepre  pbrbr In any case, this lead me to wonder p  pDoes C have semantics or idioms to movecopy an object into a specific memory locationp  pIs it possible to move the contents of an stl container to a specific memory locationp  pbr Edit Although I didnt point it out, I would obviously pass an allocator parameter to stdmap. Based on the informative answers I got, I realize the workaround I posted in my initial question would probably be the only way to reduce fragmentation. By using the maps copy constructor and the allocator template parameter, all memory used by the map would be properly reallocated.p  pAs a comment pointed out, this is mostly a theoretical problem. Memory fragmentation is rarely something to worry about.p
Negative 11018 pI tried numerous times over the last few weeks to get a server side MVC 2 view to work with objects with nested IList elements without much success.  I am missing some fundamental understanding that I hope this question resolves.p  pWhat I want is a form that shows a list of product where you can change information inline, including a hierarchy a list of product that each has a list of subproducts, that each has a list of images, etc.  I am trying to recreate an older MS Access form where the big form has a list of products and subforms show the related products, all allowing inline edits.  Access saves each record upon focusing on a different record.p  pSay you have a Domain Model that looks like thisp  precodepublic class Product      ...  Lots of fields like public string name get set     public IListltDepartmentgt departments get set     public IListltSubProductgt subProducts get set  public class SubProduct      ...  Lots of fields like public string name get set     public IListltImagegt images get set  public class Image      ...  Lots of fields like public string name get set  codepre  pAnd a view Model that looks like thisp  precodepublic class EditProduct      IListltProductgt products get set  codepre  pIn the MVC 2 View, how would you code the Edit fields so that you can post the single model back to the controller  I am familiar with thep  precodeltinput idproducts[0].subProducts[0].images[0].name ... gt codepre  pmechanic, but each IList needs a way to CRUD elements on the same screen.  Its a big data entry screen where speed counts as much as being able to see all products in a list.  I need Add buttons, Delete buttons, and a means to post the entire form after editing any inputs.p  pIf I look at it from a JQuery point of viewp  ul liI serialize the Model as JSON for the initial form for the first N number of IList elementsli liI load on the fly additional products in the same list when they reach the bottom of the container divli liI accept the entire Model upon savepost or accept pieces of the same form for individual entities, like having a separate html form tag for each IList elementli ul  pBut for some reason, I am just not getting how to do this at the server side.  Any links or example code for the View itself would be great.  Elements without IList seems to work great, especially with UI templates.  Would I create a bunch of individual html form tags around each editable entity and have posts only deal with one element at a timep

Negative 11018 pWe have several Python 2.6 applications running on Linux.

We could do the same in production and perhaps that really is the most practical solution, but it just feels a bit wrong to run codesvn updatecode in production. Weve also tried codefabcode, but it just never works first time. For every application something else goes wrong.

Heres what we want from a deployment process.p  ol liWe should be able to run strongone simple commandstrong to deploy an updated version of an application. If the initial deployment involves a bit of extra complexity thats fine.li liWhen we run this command it should copy certain files, either out of a Subversion repository or out of a local working copy, to a specified environment on the server, which probably means a different virtualenv. We have both staging and production version of the applications on the same server, so they need to somehow be kept separate. If it installs into sitepackages, thats fine too, as long as it works.li liWe have some configuration files on the server that should be preserved ie. not overwritten or deleted by the deployment process.li liSome of these applications strongimport modules from other applicationsstrong, so they need to be able to reference each other as packages somehow. This is the part weve had the most trouble with I dont care whether it works via relative imports, sitepackages or whatever, as long as it works reliably in both development and production.li liIdeally the deployment process should automatically install external packages that our applications depend on eg. psycopg2.li ol  pThats really it How hard can it bep

Negative 11018 pIn Actionscript and Adobe Flex, Im using a pattern and regexp with the global flag with the string.match method and it works how Id like except when the match returns multiple occurrences of the same word in the text.  In that case, all the matches for that word point only to the index for the first occurrence of that word.  For example, if the text is cat dog cat cat cow and the pattern is a search for cat, the match method returns an array of three occurrences of cat, however, they all point to only the index of the first occurrence of cat when i use indexOf on a loop through the array.  Im assuming this is just how the string.match method is although please let me know if im doing something wrong or missing something.  I want to find the specific indices of every occurrence of a match, even if it is of a word that was already previously matched.p  pIm wondering if that is just how the string.match method is and if so, if anyone has any idea what the best way to do this would be.  Thanks.p

I understand that they want to capture checked exceptions and unchecked exceptions. I guess that they want to check for Errors as well but the Sun documentation for exception handling specifically states that this is highly advised against. In the event you get a really serious error like the JVM running out of memory you may not be able to recover. This could be caught in a log file and I dont agree with it needing to be dealt with. Personally if you are tracking technical and applications exceptions errors doesnt seem like something that you would monitoring like any other exception. I could be wrong...p  p2 It isnt clear how the exceptions are being handled. In the code below the, which the exception throws to the code above it wraps a regular exception be it checked or unchecked into a custom exception and throws that. The code above looks for an OMSException which is the parent of every custom exception in the entire application. Is this a good design You can see where they include a ExceptionType to the custom exception object. There already seems to be an functionality built into the existing exception handling of Java. If it is an application exception then throw a custom exception. If it is a technical exception, something is null when it isnt suppose to be or a database connection problem, then catch a unchecked exception from Java and react accordingly. This whole thing seems confusing. I just want to know what thoughts other have on the whole thing.p  precodepublic Order performModuleOperationOrder order             throws ModuleException                                           try                 MapltString, Rulegt rules  ...                                                 catch InductException ie              throw ie                  catch Exception e                     e.printStackTrace             throw new InductExceptione.toString,e                  return order      codepre

Negative 11018 pI have a product that does online backups using rdiff. What currently happens isp  ol lipCopy the file to a staging area so the file wont disappear or be modified while we work on itpli lipHashes the original file, and computes an rdiff signature used for delta differencing Computes an rdiff delta difference if we have no prior version, this step is skippedpli lipCompresses amp encrypts the resulting delta differencepli ol  pCurrently, these phases are performed distinctly from one another. The end result is we iterate over the file multiple times. For small files, this is not a big deal especially given disk caching, but for big files 10s or even 100s of GB this is a real performancekiller.p  pI want to consolidate all of these steps into one readwrite pass.p  pTo do so, we have to be able to perform all of the above steps in a streaming fashion, while still preserving all of the outputs  file hash, rdiff signature, compressed amp encrypted delta difference file. This will entail reading a block of data from the source file say, 100k, then iterating over the file in memory to update the hash, rdiff signature, do delta differencing, and then write the output to a compressencrypt output stream. The goal is to greatly minimize the amount of disk thrashing we do.p  pCurrently we use rdiff.exe which is a thin layer on top of an underlying librsync library to calculate signatures and generate binary deltas. This means these are done in a separate process, and are done in oneshot instead of a streaming fashion. p  pHow can I get this to do what I need using the librsync libraryp

If I try to other dimensions or data to read back it runs on an acceptable level.p  pTo give an overviewp  ul liNo glReadPixels  30 frames per secondli liglReadPixels0, 0, 1, 1, GLDEPTHCOMPONENT, GLFLOAT, ampdepthdata  20 frames per second, acceptableli liglReadPixels0, 0, width, height, GLRED, GLFLOAT, ampdepthdata  20 frames per second, acceptableli liglReadPixels0, 0, width, height, GLDEPTHCOMPONENT, GLFLOAT, ampdepthdata  3 frames per second, not acceptableli ul  pWhy should the last one be so slow compared to the other calls Is there any way to remedy itp  pwidth x height is approximately 100 x 1000, the call gets increasingly slower as I increase the dimensions.p  pIve also tried to use pixel buffer objects but this has no significant effect on performance, it only delays the slowness till the glMapBuffer call.p  pIve tested this on a MacBook Air nVidia 320m graphics OS X 10.6, strangely enough my old MacBook Intel GMA x3100 got 15 fps reading the depth buffer.p  pstrongUPDATEstrong leaving GLUTMULTISAMPLE out of the glutInitDisplayMode options made a world of difference bringing the application back to a smooth 20fps again. I dont know what the option does in the first place, can anyone explainp

Negative 11018 pUsing Emacs 23.2.1 on Ubuntu Lucid, any mode based on Comint inserts occasional line breaks for larger outputs see example Shell and SQL mode output, below. Ive tried this in both SQL Mode and Shell Mode, with the same result in either case. Running similar commands in a plain terminal emulator does not cause these problems for both shell mode and mysql mode commands.p  pThings I have triedp  ul lipUsing MySQL in SQL Mode, adding the following flags A, C, t, f, n, and setting maxallowedpacket to 16MB.pli lipSetting comintbuffermaximumsize to 10240.pli ul  pNone of these have any effect on this behavior.p  pIf I scroll up to the lines in question and delete the line breaks, the output then appears correctly, so a possible solution to this problem could involve a hook that deletes every 4096th character, if such a thing is possible.p  pNote In the terminal examples, the output appears to be cut off at points other than every 4096 characters. In SQLmode, it is exactly every 4096 a suspicious number indeed.p  pHere is some sample outputp  precodebrentbattlecruiser for i in 1..4096 do echo n 0 done echo

Negative 11018 pI have a codeNSSetcode containing many thousands of codeNSValuecode objects wrapping codeCGPointscode.

Once I know the point Im testing for, I can just jump straight to that point in the array and check for a 1 or 0... does this sound better or worsep  pThanksp

Negative 11018 pSo I have a question regarding best practices. Basically Im doing the following to make accessing members of different classes easier p  precodeclass myClass1   public static int var1  public static String var2   ...  public static void method1  ...    codepre  pAnd then in other classes I can just access codemyClass1code members with codemyClass1.var1code, codemyClass1.var2code, codemyClass1.method1code. Another design pattern I see is to not use codestaticcode at all and just do codemyClass1 instance  new myClass1code and then do codeinstance.method1code or whatever. p  pI remember hearing something somewhere about static being bad... relating to global objects or whatever. But its been a while since intro to computer science, heh. p  pAnyways, beginner Java programmer just looking to get some insight into best practices. Thanks. p

display list. the library allows developers to create SVG graphics and embed the source code as an XML literal.  while this still doesnt open up the possibility of simply editing graphics using the Drawing API, its not so difficult to edit the SVG XML and it makes it possible to avoid using .swf assets for graphics in Flash Builder.  the library isnt perfect, my brief time spent with it ive leared that it doesnt seem to render radial gradients with more than 2 colors, and it doesnt allow scaling it appears you can only change the width and height properties, which is both strange and very unfortunate, but at least now i can include the code for the graphics instead of using assets.p  psource  a hrefhttplabs.zavoo.comp238 relnofollowcom.zavoo.labs  New Flex and Flash SVGWeb

Negative 11018 pIve recently started having problems with my projects wanting specific versions of their referenced assemblies even though the references are marked as Specific Version  False in my Visual Studio project.

The specific version property doesnt seem to be working. This is a huge pain because I have to rebuild and redeploy every application that references the assembly even if there are no breaking changes in the new version. I know in the past when this has been false it would use any version and if more than one was found it would use the latest version. Does anyone know what the problem isp  pEdit This has been open with no responses for a while.

Negative 11018 pIm new to node and am hacking together a node application utilizing a hrefhttpsgithub.commranneynodepcapnodepcapa to capture packet data and do interesting things with it.  One of the inputs to capturing data is the network interface to listen on, i.e. eth0.p  pI thought it would be really great if I could programmatically look up the available interfaces on the system and present them to the user of the program and allow them to pick which interface to listen on.  In C, I would use a hrefhttpkernel.orgdocmanpagesonlinepagesman2ioctl.2.htmlioctla or ioctlsocket with winsock using SIOCGIFCONF.p  pMy question is, does there currently exist a mechanism to do this in node   Ive searched quite a bit and havent arrived to any such solution.p  pIf this functionality does not currently exist,  I would assume Id be able to write a Module binding in CC using ioctl to accomplish this.p  pThank you for your timep

Negative 11018 pI have a UI that consists of a Gridview loaded with a custom adapter.  A ButtonAdapter, in this case.  So the grid loads fine, the button clicks function like I want them to, but now I have to indicate on the button that it the active selection.p  pI thought Id do this by just keeping track and changing the background. As it turns out, and based on a couple posts here on SO, the buttons dont actually exist when they are off screen...and even immediately after a scroll.  Ill often get a NullPointerException when trying to change a button background after scrolling.p  pIve tried changing the views in the adapter to RadioButtons and ToggleButtons, but they all offer similar limitations.p  pThe problem seems mostly to do with the getChildAt that I use on the grid to unselect one button, or whatever, when another one is selected.p  pIs there a workaround for this, or perhaps another suggestion of similar functionality.  A vertically scrollable, gridlike format, etc...p  pThanks for the help.p  pEDIT Thanks Craigy...I did forget to put a platform on there o.0...ill add android.p

Negative 11018 pIm trying to add a custom delegate to a custom UITableViewCell of mine.p  pOn this cell I have a button which need to fire a method in the ViewController where the UITableView is located on.p  pIm doing all the usual steps to add a custom delegate but for some reason when I open the VC on runtime the app crashes and gives me a bad access error.p  pWhen I comment all the delegate code it works properly so my guess is that something is wrong the way I add my delegate. When I leave my id property uncommented it seems to crash.p  pI implement the protocol in the VC. I did assign the delegate to the cell in the cellForRowAtIndexPath. All the delegate methods are in place. Ive been using similar constructions in other classes but never in a subclass of UITableViewCells before.p  pBefore I post some code I would like to know if someone encountered this bug before.

Editted code with logcode.p  hr  pEDIT3 There is nothing wrong with the button. It is the delegate property that is messed up somewhere.

It was the heightForRowAtIndexPath screwing me over. Thanks for all of your support anyhowp
Negative 11018 pIn Java, the body of a codedowhilecode loop and the loop condition do not belong to the same scope. So the following code wont compilep  precodedo      boolean b  false  while b  b cannot be resolved to a variable codepre  pBut this code does make sense to me.p  pAlso, I cannot find any pitfalls if the body and the condition are in the same scope since the body will always get executed, and Java does not have codeGotocode, I dont know how a variable declaration in the outermost codedowhilecode body scope could be skipped. Even if it is possible, the compiler could always detect such possibility and then produce compile time errors.p  pIs there any reason for this behavior aside from keeping the codedowhilecode loop in the same format as codewhilecode I am really curious.

Negative 11018 h1Situationh1  pI may not be using PHPUnit in its traditional sense.  Im using PHPUnit with Selenium 2.  We had this idea to record the actions Selenium is performing in a steps to reproduce sort of way.  Meaning if we call Selenium to click or type, the action is recorded.  If an action fails, it is also recorded.  We arent calling asserts to setuptype actions.  For example, if were testing a page to view customer information, but before we can even get to that page we need to login, we dont assert the login actions, but only assert the final part when we have to view the customer information.p  pNow when we finally do an assert, we also want to record the result.  We created a custom Listener to capture the result.  The problem were having now is how to send the result back to our action recorder.  p  pI originally ran a PHPUnit test like sop  precodeclass SandboxTest extends PHPUnitFrameworkTestCase   tests   stepTracker  new QAStepTracker  Our custom action recorder suite  new PHPUnitFrameworkTestSuite listener  new QAListener  Our customer listener listenergtsetStepTrackerstepTracker  Passing the action recorder object to our customer listener result  new PHPUnitFrameworkTestResult     suitegtaddTestSuiteSandboxTest resultgtaddListenerlistener suitegtrunresult codepre  pThis works as I expect it to, though it feels like running it this way Im losing out a lot of functionality the codephpunitcode command has to offer.  I want to go back to using the codephpunitcode command and use a codephpunit.xmlcode config file to define the custom listener.p  pChecking the PHPUnit documentation, I noticed you can pass parameters when you define a customer listener in codephpunit.xmlcode.p  precodeltlistenersgt   ltlistener classMyListener fileoptionalpathtoMyListener.phpgt     ltargumentsgt       ltarraygt         ltelement key0gt           ltstringgtSebastianltstringgt         ltelementgt       ltarraygt       ltintegergt22ltintegergt       ltstringgtAprilltstringgt       ltdoublegt19.78ltdoublegt       ltnullgt       ltobject classstdClassgt     ltargumentsgt   ltlistenergt ltlistenersgt codepre  pis equivalent top  precodelistener  new MyListener   arraySebastian,   22,   April,   19.78,   NULL,   new stdClass  codepre  pAccording to the example, it looks like I could pass in an object... but it would be a newly instantiated object and not a preexisting one.p  pAlso, if we were to use the example above, we would get rid of codesetStepTrackercode in our customer listener and pass in the action recorder object through the customer listeners codeconstructcodep  h1Questionh1  pIs it at all possible to pass in a variable through a custom listener via codephpunit.xmlcode  p  pWe would also define a bootstrap to initialize the action recorder.  p  pIf not, would the best course of action make the action recorder object global in the bootstrap and have the custom listener access it that wayp

Negative 11018 pIve written a basic visualisation tool that pulls some data from a MySQL database into a few views, and does some maths in python. p  pIve built the tool, for the most part I now have a somewhat odd problemp  pIm trying to convey as much simple data as I can, using the graphics and the colour of the main tool I have at my disposal. p  pWithout going into the minutiae of the project I have two primary variables, A and B. A has 4 values, and B has 5. p  pI want to use Green when A4, Yellow for A3, Orange when A2 and Red when A1.  In the Bvariable space, I thought Id use saturation  100  5, 80  4, 60  3, 40  2 and 20  1p  pIm not wedded to these values  they make a kind of logical sense emquaem the story I want to tell, as well as mathematical sense, by their suggestion of distinct levels, or boundaries in the data. p  pOnly, they dont. The colors dont convey this information to the user. It is hard to visually differentiate the 100 colours from the 80  I guess this is due to the fact that our colour response isnt linear. p  pI wonder if anyone has any thoughts about how I might divvy up my two variable plans in a decently perceptible fashion, using colourp  pI appreciate this question might be in the wrong place  Im not sure where else I could ask about such a thing.p

Negative 11018 pIs there any good way at all to deploy a Ruby on Rails app built on Ruby 1.9.3 and Rails 3.2.6 with Apache on a Windows machine Ive spent hours scouring the forums, but all of the posts seem to be too old to work with the newest versions of Ruby and Rails. Mongrel is no longer under development and constantly causes Rails to crash, thin has only rudimentary Windows support and on my computer causes the Ruby runtime to terminate itself in an unusual way, Passenger is Linuxonly... Im kinda lost at this point.p  pIs there any stable, welldocumented solution for serving Rails apps built on the newest frameworks with Apache on Windowsp  pstrongUPDATEstrongp  pI finally ended up working out my own solution. Check it out below for an uptodate guide to Rails deployment on Windows.p

Negative 11018 pI am trying to create a collection of workbooks that will allow me to more easily keep track of all the workbooks that are opened.

Therefore I have decided to use a collection. However, I keep getting an error when i put in a second workbook, and I am not sure what is going on.

Negative 11018 pI have no idea of this is actually possible, but i want the device to have different activities for landscape and portrait. I have a listview, and of all the items in my listview i have the coordinates. So i thought, it would be nice if you put your device in landscape, and show a mapview with icons placed on the locations of the items.p  pI know you can create different layouts for different orientations, but only creating an mapview and using that as landscape layout wont do the trick i guess. Is there something possible in an equivalent way for activities I couldnt find it, so probably not.p  pElse i think this might work I thought myself of a switch in the activity on portrait  do this and load this layout, on landscape  do that and use the other layout. But this would only work once if put in the oncreate. But than the a hrefhttpdeveloper.android.comreferenceandroidviewOrientationEventListener.html relnofolloworientationlistenera would do the trick. Anyone knows of this is possiblep

Negative 11018 pTLDR I want to eliminate an entire joinsubselect if a parameter says so.p  pLets say I have a query in a stored procedure like thisp  precodeopen curresult for select t1. from table1 t1 join select key, value, rownumber over partition by key order by whatever rn from table2 t2 on t1.key  t2.key and t2.rn  1 where [...lots of things...] and t2.value  something codepre  pYou see, I dont just join table1 to table2, I need to join only the first records of table2 based on some criteria, hence the rownumber calculation in the subquery and rn1 additional join condition. Anyway, the point is that this is an expensive subquery, and I want to filter based on this subquery.p  pMy goal is that this subquery should be conditional, based on an additional parameter. If I want to repeat everything, heres how it looksp  precodeif shouldfiltertable2  1 then   [the above query is copied here completely] else   open curresult for   select t1. from table1 t1    no table2 join   where [...lots of things...]    no table2 condition end if codepre  pThe problem is that there can be many such parameters and so many branches of almost the same SQL which looks ugly and is hard to maintain. I could also do thisp  precodeopen curresult for select t1. from table1 t1 join select key, value, rownumber over partition by key order by whatever rn from table2 t2 on t1.key  t2.key and t2.rn  1 where [...lots of things...] and shouldfiltertable2  0 or t2.value  something codepre  pThis is easy to maintain, but if the parameter says that the subquery doesnt matter, it is still executed unconditionally. Based on my experiences, Oracle cant optimize this and this is a huge performance hit.p  pSo the question can you do this in 1 query AND with good performance Something like thisp  precodeopen curresult for select t1. from table1 t1 join case when shouldfiltertable2  1 then select key, value, rownumber over partition by key order by whatever rn from table2 else [empty table] end t2 on t1.key  t2.key and t2.rn  1 where [...lots of things...] and shouldfiltertable2  0 or t2.value  something codepre  pSo if shouldfiltertable2 is 0, the subquery shouldnt be calculated and the filter shouldnt be applied at all.p  pDynamic SQL should be avoided. I suspect how to do this in dynamic SQL, but it raises the same maintainability issue.p
Negative 11018 pIve got a problem that Ive already solved on the Xserver level BTW Im running Ubuntu 12.04 but not in GVim.p  pI have a German keyboard layout with the letters kbdkbd and kbdkbd where kbd[kbd and kbd]kbd are on a qwerty keyboard. But now I want to change vims normal mode mappings so I can type kbdkbd and kbdCtrlkbdkbdkbd as if it were kbd[kbd and kbdCTRLkbdkbd[kbd, respectively. So I created an xmodmap file and mapped kbdCtrlkbdkbdkbd to kbdCTRLkbdkbd[kbd. Now the xserver exhibits the right response e.g. when I map kbdCtrlkbdkbdkbd to kbdCtrlkbdkbdukbd I can erase the current line in codextermcode.p  pBut somehow this doesnt work in gVim, and as far as I understand the gVim help it handles escape sequences like kbdCtrlkbdsomething in a special way e.g. kbdCtrlkbdkbdkbd in insert mode yields a plain kbdkbd in contrast to the behavior in codextermcode. But I dont understand how to solve this. Can anyone help mep  h3EDITh3  pIve noticed that it emdoesem work when I run Vim in my terminal emulator which is codeguakecode, but not in GVim which I want to get working.p

Negative 11018 pI need to create a wizard type web application to acquire data for a report. There are multiple sections so multiple wizard workflows. In addition a workflow could change ie a step could be added.p  pI am considering the best database design, and started with a traditional ER design with explicit column names as is always recommended.

Negative 11018 pIn my current system the menu is generated via a CustomControl code, which is shared by others project to generate menu as well. Currently i need to add some functionality to it so that when the scree size shrunk it would be reworked into a design more suited for smaller screen i.e. mobile.p  pI have worked out how should i make the changes work, however, i found that having html code generated via CustomControl might not be that easy to maintain. For one, the person whos going to change it would need to know what it is doing and need to have the knowledge on the lifecycle of it as well.p  pIm thinking whether i should refactor the CustomControl into a UserControl, but having read the different between them, it seems that CustomControl is actually more suited since this menu system is being shared across multiple application.p  pSo what do you guys think Is having it generated by CustomControl a bad practice since it makes it more difficult to maintain If i use UserControl is that a way to cut down the code duplication for itp  pThanksp
Negative 11018 pI noticed that some of the legacy scripts that Im working on for a project werent working anymore after my team upgraded to Dojo 1.8.  Specifically, the global variable that they created wasnt being created any more.p  pI dug around and found out that the Dojo 1.8 team is very much opposed to global variables.  So opposed, in fact, that they make it physically impossible for the user to create a global variable in a required script using the following code at the end of their requirep  precodereq.eval          functiontext, hint             return evaltext  rn sourceURL  hint          var eval  new Functionreturn evalarguments[0] codepre  pThats wonderful and all, but the old code Im working with cant be changed, so Ive been trying to figure out how to get around this and execute the eval in the local context instead.p  pFortunately, codedojo.evalcode is still there from older versions of Dojo, and that does what I want it to.  So I just need to get access to codereq.evalcode and change the function to do codereturn dojo.eval...code or even just codeeval...code in certain instances.p  pThe problem is, I havent been able to figure out how to get access to codereqcode.  Heres what happensp  pI include codedojo.jscode in script tags at the top of my HTML file.  It loads in its own script file.p  pcodedojo.requirecode is accessible from my own files.  Its defined with codedefinecode in the script filep  precodedojobaseloaderfunction define[.kernel, ..has, require, module, .json, .lang, .array], functiondojo, has, require, thisModule, json, lang, array  codepre  pIm not sure if thats important or not.  Anyway, inside the scope of codedojo.requirecode, I can see something called codeinjectModulecode, while in my own file I cant.  codeinjectModulecode is a local variable so you cant see it with codethiscode.  It is defined in an anonymous function at the start of the file, i.e. p  precodefunction ... injectModule  function ...  codepre  pInside the codeinjectModulecode function, theres the following linep  pcodereq.getTexturl, legacyModesync, xhrCallbackcodep  pwhich goes to codereq.evalcode.  So codeinjectModulecode can see codereqcode.p  pIm not sure what to do.  None of my nefarious JavaScript tricks have helped me even begin to navigate this gridlock of scopes.  A good start would be figuring out how to see codeinjectModulecode from my outer script file that calls codedojo.requirecode.  I wasnt able to do it with bind, though, because its a local variable defined in an anonymous function.  Is this even going to be possiblep  pTo make things a little easier, heres a summaryp  pFile 1p  precodeltscript srcdojo.jsgtltscriptgt dojo.requireFile 3 console.logglobalVar codepre  pFile 2p  precodefunctionreq.eval  unhelpful function define[require], functionmodule     dojo.require  functionxreq.evalx  codepre  pFile 3p  precodeglobalVar  ... codepre  pI can modify files 1 and 3, but file 3 will always need a global variable.  I cant modify file 2.  The goal is to change codereq.evalcode in file 2 to be a better function.p  pDeclaring the global variable earlier doesnt work because the scope change means file 3 still wont be able to see it.p  pReflection and string replacement doesnt work because the scope is wrong and the JS is minified on the serverside.p  pOverwriting the methods from file 1 doesnt work because I cant see through the scope.p  pUsing the JavaScript codebindcode function has been fruitless as well.p

Negative 11018 pI am trying to solve a big numerical problem which involves lots of subproblems, and Im using Pythons multiprocessing module specifically Pool.map to split up different independent subproblems onto different cores. Each subproblem involves computing lots of subsubproblems, and Im trying to effectively memoize these results by storing them to a file if they have not been computed by any process yet, otherwise skip the computation and just read the results from the file. p  pIm having concurrency issues with the files different processes sometimes check to see if a subsubproblem has been computed yet by looking for the file where the results would be stored, see that it hasnt, run the computation, then try to write the results to the same file at the same time.

Negative 11018 pI have a java application which allows the user to place images within a jScrollPane. The application displays a box which snaps to a grid to show where the tile will be placed as well as some information about options and the position in the overall pane. I am running the program on a Mac running Lion. When using the trackpad to scroll horizontally the information painted around the cursor is updated and moves with the cursor. However, while scrolling vertically the information and box that indicates where the tile will be placed drag rather than being updated with the cursors position stay where they where and are left behind without updating until the mouse is moved. Also the information and box do not get repainted while using the arrow keys to scroll either vertically or horizontally. p  pI am assuming that the problem is that it is not calling the paint method, however I do not know how to call the paint method while scrolling or why it still seems to call it when only scrolling horizontally with the trackpad.

Negative 11018 pI have a question about deploying to an Azure website and I hope someone can help.p  pAssuming I am running my largeish website on Azure as a Reserved Mode with 3 instances for scale.  We link up TFS publishing, so we can queue a build and automatically deploy to the server.p  pMy question is with multiple reserved instance servers, does the deploy do something clever behind the scenes to ensure the site is never down  such as deploying to one server at a time after removing it from the pool and then placing it back into the pool   Or if the deploy takes a few minutes, are all three servers down at the same time  If so, what is best practice for deploying updates to a live Azure website server without bringing down the site  albeit brieflyp  pBackground  were in our RampD stage with Azure, with a plan to move our ecommerce site from inhouse hosting to Azure. So far weve done a lot of testing with running on Cloud Services and like the easy way of publishing out to staging, and then being able to quickly flip from staging to release.  However, we would prefer to use websites instead if possible as they eliminate some of the downsides of using Cloud services instead. We cannot afford to have our websites down during each publish though  even if it was for only a small amount of time.p  pHope someone can help or point us in the right directionp  pThanks,p  pRichard.p

Negative 11018 pThis is a question regarding the best practice for creating an instance of a class or type from different forms of the same data using python. Is it better to use a class method or is it better to use a separate function altogether Lets say I have a class used to describe the size of a document. Note This is simply an example. I want to know the best way to create an instance of the class NOT the best way to describe the size of a document.p  precodeclass Sizeobject          Utility object used to describe the size of a document.

Is it better to use a class method or is it better to use a separate function altogetherp  precodeclass Sizeobject          Utility object used to describe the size of a document.

For a long time I have preferred the class method approach because I like the organisational benefits of tying the class and the factory method together. Also, using a class method preserves the ability to create instances of any subclasses so its more object orientated. On the other hand, a friend once said When in doubt, do what the standard library does and I am yet to find an example of this in the standard library.p  pAny feedback is much appreciated.p  pCheersp

Negative 11018 pI created a print style sheet which links to my html page. Changes to the font, colors etc. work in the print version, but I can not change the size of my divs in the print version. For example, if I have a content div that is 300px X 300px on my page, it wont change it if I change the dimensions in the print version.  To figure out the root of the problem, I used inspect element to see if an css was overriding that in my print page. I found that the content div width is controlled by the body width. So I tried changing the content height and the body div in the print stylesheet. That did not work. I also tried creating a separate style sheet for both the main css and the print css. That did not work. Is there another way I can troubleshoot this issue...something similar to breakpoints maybe, but for htmlp  pHTMLp  precode    ltDOCTYPE htmlgt     lthtml xmlnshttpwww.w3.org1999xhtmlgt     ltheadgt     ltmeta httpequivContentType contenttexthtml charsetutf8 gt     lt TITLE  FROM SPECIFIC TO GENERAL gt     lttitlegtPagelttitlegt     ltcfinclude templateassets2011webfontscomment.htm gt     ltlink relstylesheet typetextcss        hrefassets2011MyFontsWebfontsOrderM2845569css.css gt     ltlink relstylesheet typetextcss hrefassets2011cssglobal.css gt     ltlink  hrefprint.css typetextcss relstylesheet mediaprintgt     ltstylegt       body      width 8700px      height2000px      overflow hidden            section      width 8000px      float left       height 1000       zindex 1                 content        width 1000px height300px margintop 10px marginleft 50px overflow auto               .navbarLeft       height 700px       width 40px        top0      zindex 2        positionabsolute       backgroundposition 50 30        backgroundimage urlnavL.png      backgroundrepeat norepeat     opacity 0.05              .navbarLefthover        opacity 0.5                 .navbarRight        height 700px       width 40px     top 0      zindex 2     position absolute     backgroundposition 50 30     backgroundimage urlnavR.png     backgroundrepeat norepeat     opacity 0.05     left 2013px           .navbarRighthover       opacity 0.5          table,tr,td      border1px solid black           ltstylegt       ltheadgt       ltbodygt       ltFactor 1gt      ltdiv classsection idfactor1gt      ltdiv idcontentgt        ltBegin Contentgt             ltpgttextiyiuypilkhjkujpmjljuipoupojhikhiyuiujltpgt         ltdivgt       ltEnd Contentgt        lt Navigation gt      ltul classnavgt       lta hreffactor2gtltdiv class navbarLeft idmenu styleleft 755pxgtltdivgtltagt       ltulgt       ltdivgt       ltEnd Factor 1gt       ltFactor 2gt    ltdiv classsection idfactor2gt     ltdiv idcontentgt         ltpgttext2khlikhlkjljlji0piomlojlkjoippm,klikpltpgt      ltdivgt      ltul classnavgt      lta hreffactor1gtltdiv class navbarRight idmenu styleleft 2005pxgtltdivgt         ltagt      lta hreffactor3gtltdiv class navbarLeft idmenu styleleft 2755pxgtltdivgtltagt      ltulgt     ltdivgt      ltEnd Factor 2gt      ltJavaScriptgt      ltscript typetextjavascript                   srchttpajax.googleapis.comajaxlibsjquery1jquery.min.jsgtltscriptgt     ltscript typetextjavascript src..newUIjquery.easing.1.3.jsgtltscriptgt     ltscript typetextjavascriptgt             function                  ul.nav a.bindclick,functionevent                     var anchor  this                     html, body.stop.animate                         scrollLeft anchor.attrhref.offset.left                     , 1000                     event.preventDefault                                     ltscriptgt       ltbodygt     lthtmlgt codepre  pCSS Print Style Sheetp  precode       body          width 1000px               section, .navbarLeft, .navbarRight     displaynone           content        fontsize 110px        overflowvisible        height 1000px        pagebreakafter always        margintop10px         marginleft50px             p aafter      content   attrhref      fontsize 50      codepre

Negative 11018 pI developed a site in Drupal that takes you through several pages to help develop a plan.  The idea is if someone while making the plan moves off to another part of the site and then comes back to the plan their spot will be saved in a session.p  pIt all works fine in Firefox and IE, but in Chrome it doesnt most times.p  pWhen it does work its because you use the sites links to get back to the plan.

Negative 11018 pIm trying to do something potentially stupid, but I reckon its a good idea, so bear with me. I tried to implement it, but I hit an awkward issue with sockets closing between threads  so I want some fresh eyes on the case.p  h3Scenarioh3  pI want to write an object from a codeClientcode to a codeServercode via sockets. There may be more than one codeClientcode communicating with the codeServercode concurrently.p  pThe object, a codeMessagecode, is handled by the codeServercode through its handling mechanisms. It is proposed that instead of the codeServercodes main thread looking out for new incoming connections, a codeListenercode thread is set up. Once it spots an incoming connection, it alerts the codeServercode, storing the socket in a queue without receiving the data, so it can go back to listening quickly.p  pIn its own time, the codeServercode picks up the waiting socket, spawns a new thread, reads the codeMessagecode, and closes the socket.p  h3The codeh3  pHeres my first thoughts on how this should be implemented.

Negative 11018 h1What we needh1  pMy team is maintaining and adding features to a product thats already in production. We are trying to figure out how to improve our deployment strategy so that we can begin deploying one feature atatime instead of large chunks of features. Ideally, when a feature passes QA and Business Acceptance, we would like to deploy JUST that feature to production at any time. p  h1What we are doing now that doesnt workh1  pWe are already following the concept of Branch per Feature. Right now, we are creating new feature branches off of our development branch. When we are finished with a feature, we create a pullrequest back to the dev branch. That pull request looks GREAT... it only has the changes that are relevant to the feature. After codereview, the branch is merged into dev master and deployed to dev and QA takes a look. Once QA approves the feature, we merge the original feature branch into the staging branch and deploy to staging. Once the business accepts the new feature, the original feature branch is merged into production. Our problem is that the original feature branch seems to snowball by the time it gets to production with many changes that dont seem relevant to the feature branch. In the end, we have deployed to production many things that were not QAed or accepted by the business.p

The obvious solution is to generate up front a cell array of the various line styles, and colors as inp  pre classlangml prettyprintoverridecodelinestyles,, ...etc colorscolormapjetnLines codepre  pthen access each of those on every iteration. What I want is access to the default colors which will be generated from ColorOrder, and the default line cycling, which comes from LineStyleOrder. If I try something like p  pre classlangml prettyprintoverridecodegetgca,LineStyleOrder codepre  pThis only returns the styles used in that axis Ive only tested this on an axis defined with one of the styles, but point is, it doesnt give me all possible linestyles.

Negative 11018 pIm writing an API wrapper in Ruby for the a hrefhttpomeka.org relnofollowOmekaa API. Part of the API is making a class that represents an item on the Omeka site. A GET request to the API returns a JSON object, which I convert to a hash see below, since its long. Rather than making users navigate through a long hash, Im using the a hrefhttpsgithub.comaetherknightrecursiveopenstruct relnofollowRecursive Open Structa gem to create accessor methods. For examplep  precodeclass OmekaItem    attraccessor data    def initializehash     data  RecursiveOpenStruct.newhash, recurseoverarrays gt true   end  end codepre  pAssuming that Ive made an instance of the class called codeitemcode that lets the user access data like so codeitem.data.idcode or codeitem.data.modifiedcode.p  pThe most important data is in the element texts array. There are two kinds of element texts Dublin Core and Item Type Metadata. Id like to create a separate Open Struct for the data in those fields.

The class needs to implement a codetohcode method to return a hash in the original format with changed data, so that I can pass it to POST and PUT methods. If someone were to change the data by calling codeitem.data.elementtext[1].text  My new datacode then I could easily call the method on the open struct that returns a hash. But if a user changes codeitem.dublincore.title  My new titlecode that data will be separate from the open struct stored in codedatacode.

Negative 11018 pRecently I have been reading Effective C Second Edition by Scott Meyers to improve on C best practices.

The macro is as followsp  precode    if COCOS2DDEBUG is not defined, or if it is 0 then    all CCLOGXXX macros will be disabled     if COCOS2DDEBUG1 then        CCLOG will be enabled        CCLOGERROR will be enabled        CCLOGINFO will be disabled     if COCOS2DDEBUG2 or higher then        CCLOG will be enabled        CCLOGERROR will be enabled        CCLOGINFO will be enabled     define CCLOGWITHFUNCTIONs, ...  NSLogs  ,FUNCTION,[NSString stringWithFormats, VAARGS]  define CCLOGs, ...  NSLog,[NSString stringWithFormats, VAARGS]   if definedCOCOS2DDEBUG  COCOS2DDEBUG  0 define CCLOG... do  while 0 define CCLOGWARN... do  while 0 define CCLOGINFO... do  while 0  elif COCOS2DDEBUG  1 define CCLOG... CCLOGVAARGS define CCLOGWARN... CCLOGWITHFUNCTIONVAARGS define CCLOGINFO... do  while 0  elif COCOS2DDEBUG gt 1 define CCLOG... CCLOGVAARGS define CCLOGWARN... CCLOGWITHFUNCTIONVAARGS define CCLOGINFO... CCLOGVAARGS endif  COCOS2DDEBUG codepre  pThis macro provides for incredible utility which I will want to incorporate in my C programs. Writing a useful log statement is as simple asp  precodeCCLOGError in x due to y codepre  pWhat is even better, is that if the COCOS2DDEBUG is set to 0, then these statements never see the light of day. There is no overhead for checking a conditional statement to see if logging statements should be used. This is convenient when making the transition from development to production. How could one recreate this same effect in Cp  pSo does this type of macro belong in a C program Is there a better, more C way of doing thisp

So anyone know a way to do itp  pThanks in advance.p  pPD Id like to do it without declaring the service as singleton so every REST request is answered from another instance of the service actual stateless RESTp  pUpdate The web.xml code I use to deploy the service isp  precodeltservletgt     ltservletnamegtjerseyserlvetltservletnamegt     ltservletclassgtcom.sun.jersey.spi.container.servlet.ServletContainerltservletclassgt     ltinitparamgt         ltparamnamegtcom.sun.jersey.config.property.resourceConfigClassltparamnamegt         ltparamvaluegtcom.sun.jersey.api.core.ClassNamesResourceConfigltparamvaluegt     ltinitparamgt     ltinitparamgt         ltparamnamegtcom.sun.jersey.config.property.classnamesltparamnamegt         ltparamvaluegtcom.mypackage.MyServiceClassltparamvaluegt     ltinitparamgt     ltinitparamgt         ltparamnamegtcom.sun.jersey.api.json.POJOMappingFeatureltparamnamegt         ltparamvaluegttrueltparamvaluegt     ltinitparamgt     ltloadonstartupgt1ltloadonstartupgt ltservletgt  ltservletmappinggt     ltservletnamegtjerseyserlvetltservletnamegt     lturlpatterngtrestlturlpatterngt ltservletmappinggt codepre
Negative 11018 pIs there a library that could help decode the punched tape from an image a hrefhttpen.wikipedia.orgwikiPunchedtape relnofollowPunched tapea is like thisimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comY11Dc.jpg altPunched tapep  pThe dots have different color than background. The image is just a white rectangle with black dots. I need to locate the dots and then decode the text. The desired output is for example an array 00011, 11001, ... where 1 is the dot, 0 is the missing dot.p  pWhat approach would you recommend I would prefer something easy to use like pythons PIL or ImageMagick or something in ruby.p

Negative 11018 pthere is a function i use, that i created that should get the bitmapdata and send it back from the urls of a object. I track how many times the function is called the codedcode variable, and how many times it comes back, it should of course be equal, but it isnt.p  pHeres the function i use. it checks if there are multiple attachments in one object, then loads the bitmap, and if the amount of attachments equals the amount it should have it sends an array with the bitmaps back to the functionp  precodeprivate

Negative 11018 pIm having an odd problem.

Negative 11018 pI am trying to write a simplest multithreaded TCP server in C, which receives the data from multiple clients.p  pEvery time a new client is connected, the socket connection is established and the socket is passed as an argument to the new class function, after that the while loop runs and receives the data till the client is connected.p  pThe problem here is that the socket.receive is not blocking and receives 0 bytes of data.

However, as I understand it, this would not work because the PDFStamper cannot edit existing chunks of text once they are created. My second thought is to create the document twice. The first time, I would create the document and simply make a hashmap of referenced places in the text and page numbers.

Negative 11018 pTLDR Using coderequire classnamecode in another model file so I can deserialize a column works locally but results in the codeNo such file to load  Classnamecode error when deploying to Heroku.p  hr  pIve made the admittedly poor design decision to serialize a model attribute which contains an array of another models objects codeUserCategoryQueuecode has a serialized queue of codeCardcode objects.  In order to actually deserialize these objects, Ive followed the advice in a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions13750342yamlloadraisesundefinedclassmoduleerrorYAMLload raises undefined classmodule errora to use coderequire Cardcode in the files where I need to deserialize that column.  That avoids the issue where YAML doesnt know what its looking at when it gets to the codeCardcode object.p  pThis works fine on the localhost server but has resulted in a lot of issues when deploying to Heroku, all of the form codeNo such file to load  Cardcode.  Initially, this occurred during the asset precompilation phase, then I precompiled the assets myself and the same error has moved to when I try to run code heroku run rake dbmigratecode to get everything set up for the first time.p  pSample Filesp  precode appmodelsusercategoryqueue.rb class UserCategoryQueue lt ActiveRecordBase   ...

Negative 11018 pI am new to Hibernate and I encountered a problem. I have two entities Student and Course. Students can have many courses, and courses can have many students. When I am making a new course and add it to the database and in the same session I add this course to the students courses student.getCourses.addcourse everything is working fine and records are added both in the Courses table and the StudentsCourses table.

Negative 11018 pIt is known that codegetsockoptsock, SOLSOCKET, SOSNDBUF, ampoptval, ampoptlencode returns the twice of the size of the tcp buffer that was allocated before in codesetsockoptcode.p  pAs written in codeman 7 tcpcodep  pcodeNote that TCP actually allocates twice the size of the buffer requested in the        setsockopt2  call,  and  so a succeeding getsockopt2 call will not return the same size of buffer as requested in the setsockopt2 call.  TCP        uses the extra space for administrative purposes and internal kernel structures,codep  pSo if I do codesetsockoptsock, SOLSOCKET, SOSNDBUF, int ampbufsize, sizeofbufsizecode for codebufsize  256Kcode, code512Kcode will be allocated and returned in codegetsockoptcode.p  pI want to count the current amount of bytes in codetcp buffercode. for that Im counting the length of each packet in the queue codeskgtskwritequeuegtlencode while codeskcode is codestruct sock skcode.p  pIt happens that there are times which the length returned is bigger than code256Kcode. for instance, I got code294879code bytes that is code32735code bytes more than code256Kcode.p  pWhy does it happens Does it includes codeextra space for administrative purposes and internal kernel structurescode as the codegetsockopt.., SOLSOCKET, SOSNDBUF, ..code p  pThanks.p

Negative 11018 pThis seemed like such a trivial idea but... I want my Java EE7 WebSocket endpoint to have a method for observing events so that I can send messages back to the browser client when the event fires. It makes sense to put the event on the WebSocket because thats where you can cache the Session when it opens the WebSocket, and use it to send a message back to the right client.p  pBut... If I use a simple Observes method on the WebSocket, when the event fires it creates a emnewem WebSocket instance which does not have the Session cached. Alternately, when I use ObservesnotifyObserverIFEXISTS to try and block the creation of a new WebSocket instance, it doesnt fire at all.p  pHelp Is it not possible to use a WebSocket endpoint as an event observer Or is there a better way to route messages back to the client who opened the socket in the first placep
Negative 11018 pI have a list of ten measures in SettingsAEAE total number of measures can vary and need to check with VBA if all of these measures exist in Data88 as column headers using the name of the measure as the unique identifier.p  pThe goal is for this macro to check if a measure exists in the Data tab, and to add a new column with the respective measure name in row eight if it does not. If the measure does not exist in SettingsAEAE and does exist in Data88, the respective column should be deleted. This will be used to maintain an uptodate data sheet of measures each row is lineitem by date by team member.p  pI can figure out the insertingdeleting columns, but what I need help with is writing a macro to check the Data tab against the Settings tab. p  pI searched around and it appears a .Find and .FindNext Loop is the solution, but Im not sure how to write this as the What value, the measure name, changes at each iteration of the loop SettingsAE1, SettingsAE2, ect..p  pWould someone be able to provide a VBA code for what this should look like Thanks p

Negative 11018 pIm currently building a database. The tables are all done and now Im adding in my stored procedures. Im also writing tests using tSQLt and Red Gates SQL Test. Because of how this adds information to the database each test is its own stored procedure, plus there are a large number of tSQLt stored procedures, Im getting a very, very large number of stored procedures.p  pIm finding that Im scrolling up and down a lot in the Object Explorer window as I go back and forth between the list of tables writing several tests for each table based upon its data structure and the stored procedure list when I need to createupdate a stored procedure for a test that is failing.p  pIve already split out my Object Explorer and my SQL Test windows onto a separate monitor Apple TV Airplay on a 55 TV FTW, yet Im finding that a little tweak could help me immensely.p  pTypically, Im working in one range of my table list and one range of my stored procedure list, so that if I had two windows, I could set one to the relevant area of my table list and one to the relevant area of my sproc list, limiting or eliminating my scrolling.p  pEach time I try to select Object Explorer from the View menu, it simply highlights the currentlyopened instance. Is there any way to get 2 of these Is there any other workaround to get the same effectp
Negative 11018 pIm building a dragging interface using Angular and jQueryUI. The reason I want to use Angular is, I wanted angularJS 2 way data binding which is really awesomep  pHere is the codepen  a hrefhttpcodepen.ioanonpenqmuvH relnofollowhttpcodepen.ioanonpenqmuvHap  pIn the codepen  you will see there is box with text  hello everyone divlayer. I did bind its style with angular  p  precodetoplayer.data.toppxleft layer.data.leftpx codepre  pAnd added two input fields which also have strongngmodelstrong to that same stronglayer.data.topstrong and stronglayer.data.leftstrong So when you change the value in the input field  it will move the div element. So far this works great.p  pBut I also made that hello everyone div draggable using jqueryUI in angular directive. So you can drag that element around.p  pWhat I want now is  If I drag around the hello everyone div element  it will also update stronglayer.data.leftstrong and stronglayer.data.topstrong.  So this will also change the value in the input field. How can I do thatp

Negative 11018 pSo I am making a game in LibGDX where I am using the AssetManager to load all my assets. Im just not sure which is the proper way to use it.p  pCurrently I am loading all the games assets before the first screen.  Then I clear the manager in the dispose method. But that means that I have a bunch of textures etc that I wont need for all the screens. Could that lead to memory leaks p  pThe other approach I have in mind is to only load the assets I need for each screen and then unload them in each screens hide method. p  pSo I was wondering which of these two methods is the best way to go, or if there is  a better way to deal with thisp  pThanksp

Negative 11018 pIm struggling with some architectural choices for a scalable internetofthings application.p  pIve chosen to base my project on a hrefhttpstwistedmatrix.comTwisteda augmented with the a hrefhttpcyclone.ioCyclonea framework to provide many a hrefhttpwww.tornadoweb.orgTornadoa convenances websockets, authdecorators, securecookies, etcp  pUsing a Twisted core has worked beautifully for me. I have numerous IP protocol and hardware interfaces all of which turned out to have great library support inside of twisted and adding new protocols and interfaces to my application are the mostlikely angles Ill have project scope creep, all with Twisted needing very low CPU and providing for very high connection counts.p  pMy problems are with secondorder webapp functionality.p  pI pulled in Cyclone thinking that with its auth goodies OpenID, oauth, userauth decorators and securecookies it wouldnt take much to implement usersessionadmin functionality in my webapp.  After the 500 lines of abstracting my database via a hrefhttpsgithub.comfiorixmongoasyncpythondrivertxmongoa and emjustem building user logins it became clear I bothp  ol liDidnt understand how little CycloneTornado bring in the usersessionadmin space, and li liDidnt understand the amount of code it takes to fill in the gaps if your trying to build a multiuser auth webappli ol  pA friend pointed me at a hrefhttpflask.pocoo.orgFlaska, which initially I thought was completely redundant, until I found a hrefhttpflask.pocoo.orgextensionsflask pluginsa.  The combination of a hrefhttpsflasklogin.readthedocs.orgFlaskLogina and a hrefhttpsflaskadmin.readthedocs.orgFlaskAdmina would completely cover my user, session and useradmin needs, negating me writing what I would guess to be about 2k lines of code.  Unfortunately, the flask plugins are all rife with blocking code and calls to blocking libraries. I dont see them as compatible with my project even if a hrefhttptornado.readthedocs.orgenlatestwsgi.htmlWSGIa a hrefhttptwistedmatrix.comdocuments13.1.0webhowtowebin60wsgi.htmlcontainersa are used given that the usersession functionality happens with every page load additionally I dont see any short cuts that would allow me to port them to async world without work roughly equal to that of rewriting themp  pMy question is  p  pIn the python async space ... hopefully in the Twisted space, given my protocol needs, are there any plugins or alternate frameworks that provide readytogo userloginadmin functionality similar to what is in FlaskLogin and FlaskAdminp  pP.S. Ive looked at a hrefhttpsgithub.comtwistedkleinKleina as the obvious Twisted version of Flask, but it doesnt seem to have a plugin ecosystem, and Im not finding any strong usersessionadmin there.p  pP.P.S. By the time I wrote this question I had already written my own crappy userloginsession system. So what Im really after is the Admin capability automated CRUD functions on userstyle records, including web UI rendering, all designed in a Twistedasync way.  I asked about userlogin in the question in case it turn out there is an alreadyintegraded solution such as flasklogin and flaskadmin in which case I would happily drop my code and switch to that.p

Negative 11018 pI need to call several methods from an external framework  or rather I am writing a wrapper around it for other users to call methods from this framework in a nonpredetermined order. Now some methods of the framework will throw exceptions, even though no real error occured. Basically they are supposed to be internal exceptions just to notify whoever that the action to be performed has already been performed before. For example that a file has been loaded. It wont hurt to load the file another time, so for all I care this error is no error at all. So I need to continue on this exception, but I also need to catch other, real exceptions, such as when the framework, which connects to clients and stuff, cannot do so.p  pBelow I have some extremely simplified example code. Obviously that code wont compile because the code for the custom exceptions is missing. Also in real life the code is spread over three assemblies. This means, that I cannot wrap the exception handler around those framework methods which will throw codeInternalFrameworkExceptioncode only. I can only wrap it around the whole codeSomeMethodcode. As I wrote, this is an extremely simplified example.p  pIs there any way to handle the codeRealExceptionscode but continue the codeInternalFrameworkExceptionscode without using a hrefhttpwww.sharpcrafters.com relnofollowPostSharpa as mentioned a hrefhttpstackoverflow.coma4913179810106herea Note that this is not about letting the codeInternalFrameworkExceptioncode fall through, but they should actually not break out of the codetrycode block at all.p  precodenamespace ExceptionTest      using System      internal class Program              private static void Mainstring[] args                      try                              SomeMethod                          catch InternalFrameworkException exception                               Do not actually catch it  but also dont break the                  execution of SomeMethod.

The point is to tell the application using              this framework that the value is already initialized, but              as this wont influence the execution at all.

Negative 11018 pIve inherited an issue on a Joomla site running on PHP 5.5 on IIS 7.5.

What I want to do is set this timeout to 5 or 10 seconds, and if this times out then I can continue the script only using the servers local database content, but I cant find where to set this up.  Ive found the mssql.connecttimeout entry in the php.ini but this doesnt make any difference Im sure this is for mssqlconnect calls, rather than odbcconnect, so this makes sense, and there doesnt seem to be an ODBC equivalent, Ive also tried appending Timeout10 to the ODBC connection string, but this also doesnt seem to work.  Hunting round google I have found what seem to be the settings for a Linux system, but obvisously that also isnt helpful.  Where do I need to set this in Windows, or do I need to convert it to another database connection typep

Negative 11018 pIm trying to implement a functionality where there is a stored procedure on SQL Server that has to be called from ASP MVC application and processed on the background it might take long since it calls another stored procedure remotely to process an excel file stored on a server. But the response of the last HTTP request should be returned back to client so the UI will not be hanging waiting for processing. I have tried so many different ways but UI is still not responding right away. I tried BackgroundWorker but its not allowing the main thread to response back to client until its done processing, also I tried  Thread.QueueUserWorkItemdelegate  method which performs stored procedure calls  it still not returning response and HttpContext.Current not available in background thread Maybe there is a way to start background processing, pause it for letting main thread to return response to browser and then resume background thread to make all processing with stored procedure calls Am I missing something Could someone please give an idea how I can solve this problem Would be much appreciated.p

Negative 11018 pIm programming a lightweight ui system in c for unreal engine 4. I have the ui element base class, that can add children ui elements. The problem I am facing now is with my layout manager. I need all elements to relarively move, size and rotate with the parent ui element. p  pAn element should be able to rotate around its local pivot, but still rotate with its parent. Thus I need the layout manager class to iterate over all ui elements in a hierarchy and calculate these positions sizes and rotational values. p  pIts just that I cant really figure out an algorithm for how to transform the child elements relative to its parent.p  pFor each element, these variables are known position, size, rotation quaternion, and pivot position. These are 2D vectors except for rotation which is float.p  pAs I want to retain the values as they were before layout calculations, I want these calculated values stored in seperate variables.p  pAny help on this would be god send p  pBest regards, Oyvindp

Negative 11018 pI would like to change or hide entirely the bent arrow character that appears in the Emacs fringe both on the left and right hand side. Im using Emacs 24 on a Mac, installed via homebrew. I find it to be visually distracting. A smaller character, like a center dot, might work well.p  pFor context, this is an official description of the small bent arrows from a hrefhttpwww.gnu.orgsoftwareemacsmanualhtmlnodeemacsContinuationLines.html relnofollowhttpwww.gnu.orgsoftwareemacsmanualhtmlnodeemacsContinuationLines.htmlap  blockquote   pSometimes, a line of text in the buffera logical lineis too long to fit in the window, and Emacs displays it as two or more screen lines. This is called line wrapping or continuation, and the long logical line is called a continued line. On a graphical display, Emacs indicates line wrapping with small bent arrows in the left and right window fringes. On a text terminal, Emacs indicates line wrapping by displaying a  character at the right margin.p blockquote  pThe a hrefhttpwww.emacswiki.orgemacsLineWrap relnofollowEmacs LineWrap Wiki pagea does not address my question.p  pThe best information Ive found so far is contained in a hrefhttpstackoverflow.coma12989504109618this StackOverflow answerap  blockquote   pWhen wordwrap is set to nil in a text terminal nw Emacs, the backslash character appears on the right margin.p      pWhen wordwrap is set to t in a text terminal Emacs, the backslash character is not shown. Setting visuallinemode also sets wordwrap to true.p      pThis does not apply when Emacs is running as a GUI window the small bent arrow appears on the right margin regardless of the value of wordwrap.p blockquote  pIs hiding or changing the bent arrows possible If not, an answer that says, more or less, Ive looked at X and concluded that it is impossible is ok too.p  pUpdate Although it is not a terrible workaround, changing the a hrefhttpwww.gnu.orgsoftwareemacsmanualhtmlnodeemacsFringes.html relnofollowfringesa is emnotem what Im looking for I want to customize the bent arrow character or bitmap.p

Negative 11018 pI need to install a code.NETcode assembly in codeGACcode.p  pThere is one concern  codeGACcode requires files to be strongly named.p  pFrom what I understand, a strong name consists of  p  ol liName of fileli liVersionli lisome culture information  dont know what that isli liKey pairli ol  pSo, to differentiate between different versions the contents of the file may not have changed, at least one of the parameters must be different.p  pSince I cannot change the name, I must change at least the version or the Key or both.p  pThe problem is, that in the codebuildcode environment, the internal version number does not change, and the codebuildcode numbers is only assigned later on officialcodebuildscode  not nightly codebuildscodewhich can be used for testing, which essentially have the same internal version of the file .p  pGenerating a codekey paircode every single time, when a codebuildcode is triggered seems absurd.p  pSo this is the procedure I think might work  p  ol liGenerate a key pairli liExtract public keyli liUse public key to sign the file,using assembly attribute and delay signing the fileli liTurn GAC verification off.li liUse the file freely in development and testingli liSign the key strongly whenever the assembly is actually to be shipped, and turn GAC verification ONli ol  pSo here   p  ol liIf someone would kindly confirm the procedureli liDo I need to distribute the public key anywhereli liAfter strong signing, do I then need the key anywhere elseli ol  pDo kindly advise.

Negative 11018 pConsider a large existing codebase with approx. 150 solutions and 800 C projects. Many are unit tests written using NUnit.

Negative 11018 pI have two questions im sure are very simple Im just looking over something.p  p1. To start off, my website is mostly HTML, except I have a WordPress blog page. To make the blog page look like the HTML home page, I modified the header.php and footer.php, and everything looks fine except one problem. As youll notice if you compare the Home page with the Blog page, for some reason the margins I have to position the navigation links amp social media icons isnt working but it works on the home page I really have no idea why it isnt working, the stylesheet is linked correctly and everything, as every other style works fine except the margin in those areas.p  p2. At the bottom of the home page there is a white space below the footer, but its not on the WordPress blog page I am trying to remove the white space but have had no luck. The only way I can remove it is if I make the footer 30px larger, which I dont want to do. I have set heights on the HTML, Body and am unsure why the space is there.p  pThanks ahead of time, I appreciate you taking the time to look at my questions.p  pstrongEDITstrong here is a link to the sitep  pa hrefhttpjqwebexamples.comiAMTalentVersion3revindex.html relnofollowhttpjqwebexamples.comiAMTalentVersion3revindex.htmlap

Negative 11018 pstrongBackgroundstrongp  pI know there are some similar questions, also regarding the selection sort algorithm, but I would like not to have a final answer of what is the running time complexity of my selection sort algorithm I can find it on Wikipedia, but I would like to analyse it step by step in the worst, best and average cases.p  pI am quite newbie to algorithms analysis, so I hope you are patient with me. p  pI have already read some articles about this topic around the web, but I am still stuck in analysing even a simple algorithm like selection sort, I hope you can help me clarifying.p  pstrongAlgorithmstrongp  pThis is basically my implementation of the selection sort algorithmp  precodedef selectionsortls     for i in range0, lenls  1         pos  i           for j in rangei1, lenls              if ls[j] lt ls[pos]                 pos  j         ls[pos], ls[i]  ls[i], ls[pos]     return ls codepre  pstrongWhat I knowstrongp  pWhat I have understood so far is that the analysis of the running time complexity of an algorithm is based on the input size. In my case, the input size is the size of the list.p  pI am also aware and more or less I understood the a hrefhttpen.wikipedia.orgwikiBigOnotationTheKnuthdefinition relnofollowemFamily of BachmannLandau notationsema and how more or less can be used to specify the growth of a function.p  pI understood also the growth of mathematical functions, such as logsub2subn, n, nsup2sup or 2supnsup which by the way are in increasing order.p  pI understood that, in general, when we analyse an algorithm, we analyse its worst running time case. But I know there are also the best case and the average case. In my case, I have to analyse the 3 cases as I said before.p  pstrongWhat can I dostrongp  pWhen I try to analyse my selection sort exposed above, I try to first say how many instructions take each operation. For example, I decided that assignments, indexing and returning values take 1 instruction.p  pThen, I analyse each line, not loops yet, and I try to say how many assignments, indexing operations and return operations do we I have the my selection sort algorithm.p  pIn practicep  precodepos  i                           1 assignment  if ls[j] lt ls[pos]               2 indexing operations. 1 comparison  pos  j                           1 assignment  ls[pos], ls[i]  ls[i], ls[pos]   4 indexing operations. 2 assignments  return ls                         1 return operation  codepre  pOf course, these are just assumptions. We can note that some assignments are not always executed.p  pThe most important part is probably the loops, because they are the dominant part in this case.p  pThe outer loop goes from code0code to codelenls  2code both included. Basically if the length is codencode, it will execute coden  1code times.p  pThe inner loop is more complicated. It executes each time the outer loop executes, but codekcode different times, where codekcode varies depending of the current index of the outer loopp  pIf I am not wrong, the first iteration of the outer loop will make the inner loop iterate from codei  1code to codelenls  1code both included, that is coden  1code iterations, if codencode is the size of the list. In the second iteration, it will execute coden  2code, and so on until code1code iteration. I discovered that this can be translated as the sum of the numbers from code1code to coden  1code, which can be represented by the formula coden  1  n  2code, from the mathematical formula to sum the numbers from 1 to n, which would be coden  n  1  2code.p  pstrongWhat I cannot dostrongp  ul lipConnect all the analysis I have done. pli lipContinue with the analysispli lipWrite the formal step by step analysis of worst, best and average cases of the algorithmpli ul  pI know this is a huge question, and there are already some post on Stackoverflow, but I was not able to understand from them, and I hope that a wellexplained and step my step solution to my problem can help me and other futures visitors.p  pThank youp

Negative 11018 pI realize this question is similar to a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions400631howtoplaceabanneronwebpagewithoneapplicationtoallpagesofawebsitethis onea but there didnt seem to be a definitive answer there. Currently Im using codeltphp include banner.html gtcode but in order for this to work I need to change the ext of ALL pages to .php instead of .html. p  pI dont think this is really best practice. Id prefer to keep my basic webpages as html files and reserve php files for serverside logic  isnt that the way its supposed to be p  pThe banner should be displayed at the top of each page by default as soon as the page loads, so from what Ive read codejquery.loadcode is not appropriate as that should typically be triggered by user input. This is not an ASP.NET project so master pages is not an option. Also heard about HTML templating but after googling it I walked away more confused than ever.p

Negative 11018 pI am having trouble setting an integration test for the user confirmation work flow in my app. p  pI am using Devise, and for testing Capybara and Rspec.p  pThe features I am trying to test work perfectly in the development app or at least appear to. But Im having trouble designing a test for them.p  pBasically, the workflow goes something like thisp  puser visits app  clicks register  fills in details and clicks sign up  is logged  is sent a confirmation emailp  pThis all works fine in development and test environments. p  pNext, the user clicks the link in the confirmation email. If he is already signed in, he is confirmed. If he is not signed in, he is routed to the sign in page. p  pThis is the part Im having trouble testing again, it seems to work fine in development. The issue appears to be that sign in state is not being persisted when the test clicks the link in the email. p  pMy test looks like thisp  precoderequire railshelper include DeviseTestHelpers require supportmailermacros  RSpec.configure do config   config.includeMailerMacros   config.beforeeach  resetemail  end  describe UserConfirmation do    describe when confirmation token is valid do      before each do       newuser  FactoryGirl.builduser       visit newuserregistrationpath       fillin useremail, with newuser.email        fillin userpassword, with newuser.password       fillin userpasswordconfirmation, with newuser.password       checkusertos       clickbutton Sign up     end      it confirms and logs in users that are already logged in do       expectlastemail.to.to havecontent newuser.email         expectlastemail.body.to havecontentWelcome newuser.email       expectlastemail.body.to havecontentconfirmationconfirmationtoken       link  lastemail.body.rawsource.matchhreflturlgt.gt[url]       visit link       expectpage.to havecontent Your account was successfully confirmed       expectpage.to havecontent Home     end      it confirms users that are not logged in and routes to login page do       clickbutton Sign out       expectlastemail.body.to havecontentconfirmationconfirmationtoken       link  lastemail.body.rawsource.matchhreflturlgt.gt[url]       visit link       expectpage.to havecontent Your account was successfully confirmed. You can now sign in       expectpage.to havecontent Sign in     end   end end codepre  pFrom the test output, both tests are routing to the sign in page. Detection of sign in state is something that Devise Confirmable should handle out the box, so Im confused by this. p  pSome may question why I need to test default functionality. I dont really, but I do need to have a test that gets passed this stage so that I can test later parts of the work flow.p  pI must be missing something obvious...  p

Negative 11018 pI need to host a C program on a website. The program takes arguments of the location of a file, calculate, and outputs another file with a slightly different name. Namelyp  precodegt a.exe ..input.txt codepre  pwill generate another filep  precode..input.txt.out.txt codepre  pBoth files will be small less than 10KB. Now when I put it onto the server, I found that uploading or generating files has been disabled on this server.p  pWhat I want to ask is, is there a way to pass php stream as files to the C program and make it write to a stream that it thinks as a file, so that no file is actually created on the server At the end of the day I do not need to keep those files, but just to serve the output as text in the browser.p  pp.s. I am aware of phptemp and phpmemory, but they cannot be passed to C program as if they are files. p.s.2 I am not sure whether this is more a C question or php question. Can C takes stream as input instead of filesp
Negative 11018 pThis is a question that relates to the React Native framework from Facebook. I imported a ReactNativeSample project that contains a lot of subprojects of the React Native.

Negative 11018 pI have custom data that I need to display in a QTreeView.  I have derived my model from QAbstractTableModel, and made my own implementations of rowCount, columnCount, data, and headerData.  The model has a local QList to support it, and the data function is defined to read the values out of that list of lists directly corresponding to the row and column received in the QModelIndex parameter.  There are two issues Im running into.p  pThe first is that the load of a very large file is quite slow, which is understandable.  The second is that the scroll action is painfully slow, which I am not really understanding.  Turns out that if I pull the scroll handle down, the GUI hangs for about 20 seconds, and then pops back.  If I pull the handle a greater distance down, the hang time increases accordingly.  If I pull the handle all the way to the bottom of the scroll bar, after waiting for the application to become responsive again, I can pull the handle up and down and get much better response.p  pIt seems to me that QTreeView is only asking for a small chunk of the available data, but when I have pulled the scroll handle all the way to the bottom of the scroll bar, once the application becomes responsive again, it has by that point read all the data.p  pIs there a way to program for a much more responsive experience with scrolling for large data  I dont mind a longer wait up front, so just something like forcing the view to read all data from the model up front would work.p  pI have also thought that I could go back to just deriving from QAbstractItemView and controlling how it requests and stores data, only allowing for storing the viewed data, plus a buffer of entries before and after the viewed data.  That of course would mean Id have to control the scroll bar, since the handle sizing would indicate a small amount of data, and I would like it to look to the user as it should for the size of data they are dealing with.  Not really wanting to go there if I dont have to.p

Negative 11018 pIm starting to learn angularJS better, and Ive noticed that AngularJS tries to make strong emphasis on separating the view from the controller and encapsulation. One example of this is people telling me DOM manipulation should go in directives. I kinda got the hang of it now, and how using link functions that inject the current element allow for great behavior functionality, but this doesnt explain a problem I always encounter. p  pExample I have a sidebar I want to open by clicking a button. There is no way to do this in buttons directive link function without using a hardcoded javascriptjquery selector to grab the sidebar, something Ive seen very frowned upon in angularJS hardcoding dom selectors since it breaks separation of concerns. I guess one way of getting around this is making each element I wish to manipulate an attribute directive and on its link function, saving a reference its element property into a domfactory so that whenever a directive needs to access an element other than itself, it can call the domfactory which returns the element, even if it knows nothing where it came from. But is this the Angular way p  pI say this because in my current project Im using hardcoded selectors which are already a pain to mantain because Im constantly changing my css. There must be a better way to access multiple DOM elements. Any ideasp

Negative 11018 pIm going to ask this at the risk of being too vague or asking too many things in one question, but Im really just looking for a point in the right direction.p  pIn my app I want to record audio, show a waveform while recording, and scroll through the waveform to record and playback from a specified time. For example, if I have 3 minutes of audio, I should be able to scroll back to 200 and start recording from there to fix a mistake.p  pIn Voice Memos, this is accomplished instantaneously, without any delay or loading time. Im trying to figure out how the did this, if anyone has a clue.p  pWhat Ive triedp  pEZAudio  This library is great, but doesnt do what I want. You cant scroll through the waveform. It deletes the waveform data at the beginning and begins appending it to the end once it reaches a certain length.p  pSCWaveformView  This waveform is nice, but it uses images. Once the waveform is too long, putting it in a scroll view causes really jittery scrolling. Also you cant build the waveform while recording, only afterward.p  pAs far as appending, Ive used this method a hrefhttpstackoverflow.coma115205531391672httpstackoverflow.coma115205531391672a But there is significant processing time, even when appending two very short clips of audio together in my experience.p  pHow does Voice Memos do what it does Do you think the waveform is drawn in OpenGL or CoreGraphics Are they using Core Audio or AVAudioRecorder Has anyone built anything like this that can point me in the right directionp

Negative 11018 pI have a Page model in my rails 4 app. It has an permalink attribute that is used so that when someone goes to mysite.compagespagename, the controller finds the Page with pagename as the permalink and then shows the view.p  ppagescontroller.rb p  precodedef show   page  Page.findbypermalinkparams[id] end codepre  pAfter a few months of the site being up, I want to change the permalink of a certain page, however I dont want to lose all the incoming links. Im thinking I would do this. p  pFirst Id addcolum newpermalink to the Page model. Then if this newpermalink attribute was anything but nil or blank, it would pull up a new page in the controller like thisp  precodedef show   page  Page.findbypermalinkparams[id]   if page.newpermalink.blank     page  Page.findbypermalinkpage.newpermalink   end end codepre  pThis works, but the url in the browser still shows the old URL. I suppose this might not be so bad, but I think Id like it to actually forward to the new page. Perhaps, instead of newpermalink it should be a new url and actually do a redirect What would be your best solution for this And could I make it a 301 redirectp

The class contains only static methods and fields, is declared codefinalcode so it cant be extended, and has a codeprivatecode constructor so it cant be instantiated.p  precodepublic final class SomeUtilityClass      public static final String SOMECONSTANT  Some constant      private SomeUtilityClass       public static Object someUtilityMethodObject someParameter           ...           return null       codepre  pNow, with the introduction of a hrefhttpsdocs.oracle.comjavasetutorialjavaIandIdefaultmethods.htmlstaticstatic methods in interfacesa in Java 8, I lately find myself using a utility interface patternp  precodepublic interface SomeUtilityInterface      String SOMECONSTANT  Some constant      static Object someUtilityMethodObject someParameter           ...           return null       codepre  pThis allows me to get rid of the constructor, and a lot of keywords codepubliccode, codestaticcode, codefinalcode that are implicit in interfaces.p  pAre there any downsides to this approach Are there any benefits to using a utility class over a utility interfacep
Negative 11018 pThe constructors for the codejava.util.jar.JarFilecode take a codeverifycode parameter, whose only documentation seems to be this single phrase in a hrefhttpdocs.oracle.comjavase1.5.0docsapijavautiljarJarFile.htmlJarFilejava.io.File,20boolean,20int relnofollowthe JavaDocap  blockquote   pcodeverifycode  whether or not to verify the jar file if it is signed.p blockquote  pThis obviously isnt very precise, though. What does the verification process that codeJarFilecode does entail Does it only verify the Jar file not to have been tampered with, or does it also, in some unspecified way, verify the signer certificates to be trusted What happens if verification fails, or if the signature files are malformed Is verification eager or lazy, ampcampcp  pI find it generally weird that such a procedure that seems so intimately connected to core Java security is so poorly documented, so I am concerned that this might be considered an internal API that Im not really supposed to use. Is this the case, or have I perhaps just missed the external documentation somewhere, or is it just some weird oversightp

Negative 11018 pI have recently finished an Excel workbook that utilizes a fair amount of VBA. The spreadsheet is always able to perform all of its intended functions, and there are no issues when it is the only workbook open in Excel. However, when any other workbook is open unrelated files included, the workbook will not close. Clicking on the red x in the top right corner simply does not do anything, and no error messages are shown. In order to close it, all other Excel windows must be closed beforehand.p  pWhile this does not detract from the functionality of the workbook itself, enough people will be using it that I want to avoid bringing about the inconvenience of having to close any other workbooks they have open before being able to close this one.p  pSo, does anyone have any ideas as to what is causing this to happen I do have code for the WorkbookClose event, but this is designated as private and only located within the ThisWorkbook part of this spreadsheet. Im confused as to why another sheet with no VBA involved prevents this one from closing. Please let me know if there is anything I can clarify, thank you.p  pEDIT  Here is the code for the WorkbookBeforeClose eventp  precodePrivate Sub WorkbookBeforeCloseCancel As Boolean  If Me.Saved  False Then Me.Save Call PrepareWorkbook  End Sub  Sub PrepareWorkbook  Application.ScreenUpdating  False Call UnprotectWorkbook  Dim masterSheet As Worksheet Set masterSheet  ActiveWorkbook.WorksheetsPLANNING  For Each sheet In ActiveWorkbook.Worksheets     If Not sheet.Name  README Or sheet.Name  PLANNING Or sheet.Name  PREV Then         sheet.Visible  xlSheetVeryHidden     End If     If sheet.Name  README Or sheet.Name  PLANNING Or sheet.Name  PREV Or sheet.Name  ADMIN Then         Call ProtectSheetActiveWorkbook.Worksheetssheet.Name     Else         Call ProtectPlannerSheetActiveWorkbook.Worksheetssheet.Name     End If Next  If ActiveWorkbook.ActiveSheet.Name ltgt PLANNING Then     masterSheet.Select End If  Call ProtectWorkbook  Application.ScreenUpdating  True  End Sub codepre  pI should note that commenting out the call to PrepareWorkbook within the WorkbookBeforeClose event did not solve the problem.p

Negative 11018 pI have a Producer Consumer based application based on Netty. The basic requirement was to build a message oriented middleware MOM p  pa hrefhttpsen.wikipedia.orgwikiMessageorientedmiddleware relnofollowMOMap  pSo the MOM is based on the concept of queuing Queuing makes systems loosely coupled and that was the basic requirement of the application. The broker understands the MQTT protocol. We performed stress testing of the application on our local machine. These are the specs of the local machine.p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comyTH8T.png altenter image description herep  pWe were getting great results. However, our production server is AWS Ubuntu based. So we stress tested the same application on AWS Ubuntu server. The performance was 10X strongpoorstrong than the local system. This is the configuration of the AWS server.p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.com5NhTx.png altenter image description herep  pWe have tried the following options to figure out where the issue is.p  ul liInitially we checked for bugs in our business logic. Did not find any. li liMade the broker, client and all other dependencies same on mac as well as aws. What I mean by same dependencies is that we installed the same versions on aws as on mac.li liIncreased the ulimit on AWS.li liPlayed with sysctl settings.li liWe were using Netty 4.1 and we had a doubt that it might be a Netty error as we do not have stable release for Netty 4.1 yet. So we even built the entire application using Netty 3.9.8 Final Stable and we still faced the same issue.li liIncreased the hardware configurations substantially of the AWS machine.li ul  pNow we have literally run out of options. The java version is the same on both machines.p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comQoKuS.png altenter image description herep  pSo the last resort for us is to build the entire application using NodeJS but that would require a lot of effort rather than tweaking something in Netty itself. We are not searching for Java based alternatives to Netty as we think this might even be a bug in JVM NIOs native implementation on Mac and Ubuntu. p  pWhat possible options can we try further to solve this bug. Is this a Netty inherent issue. Or is this something to do with some internal implementations on Mac and Ubuntu which are different and are leading to perfomance differences as we see them  p  pstrongEDITstrongp  pThe stress testing parameters are as follows.p  ul liWe had 1000 clients sending 1000 messages per second Global rate.li liWe ran the test for about 10 minutes to note the latency.li liOn the server side we have 10 consumer threads handling the messages. li liWe have a new instance of ChannelHandler per client. li liFor boss pool and worker pool required by Netty, we used the Cached Thread pool.li liWe have tried tuning the consumer threads but to no avail.li ul  pstrongEdit 2strongp  pThese are the profiler results provided by jvmtop for one phase of load testing.p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comwgtJq.png altenter image description herep

Negative 11018 pI am writing a program in python that will process a big amount of data it reads from some excel file. Ive build a GUI for this program using Tkinter. I know Tkinter is single threaded, hence to open the file and make some processes Ive used a thread not to block the GUI. One of the thread tasks is to fill a list called columnList in my code and use its elements as options in an optionmenu, so before the thread finishes the option menu is empty, hence Ive used join  to let the main thread wait for the worker thread. And, here comes the problem, as long as the worker thread is executing the GUI will be not responding around 7 seconds, but after that it will work normally. p  pI want to use some graphical indicator that indicates that something is being loaded, and at the same time blocks the the GUI window so the user cant click on it.

Negative 11018 pI am doing my best to replicate the algorithm described here in this a hrefhttpresearch.microsoft.compubs67276criminisitip2004.pdf relnofollowpapera for making an inpainting algorithm. The idea is to get the contour or edge points of the part of the image that needs to be inpainted. In order to find the most linear point in the region, the orthogonal normal vector is found. On page 6, a short description of the implementation is given. p  blockquote   pIn our implementation the contour   strongstrong  of the target region is modelled as a dense list of image point   locations. Given a point strongp  strong,  the  normal direction strongnpstrong   is computed as follows i the positions of the   control points of strongstrong are filtered via a bidimensional Gaussian   kernel and, ii strongnpstrong is estimated as the unit vector orthogonal to   the line through the preceding and the successive points in the   list.  p blockquote  pSo it appears that I need to put all these points in a gaussian filter. How do I set up a bidimensional Gaussian filter when we have a single dimension or a list of points p  pLets say our contour is a box shape at points, then I create a 1 dimensional list of points [1,1],[1,2],[1,3],[2,1],[2,3],[3,1],[3,2],[3,3].

Negative 11018 pThanks in advance for any help you can give me.p  pIm trying to create a VB application that will open an existing Word document, make some changes and save it with a new file name. Making the changes to the document is easy. Saving the document seems like it should be just as easy but there is one serious problem. When I try to save the document, the save as dialog opens.

I need to find a way to suppress the save as dialog or a new way of editing the word files. Everything I have found so far about the problem has either not been solvedupdated or was related to Word addins. I dont have any of the addins that people said caused the problem. To be safe, I disabled all word addins.p  pI would appreciate it if anyone has either solved it or has a different approach. Im not stuck on the idea of using VB. The only reason Im going this route is because I think it gives me the best library for editing charts and formatting the documents.p  pThanks, Stevep

Negative 11018 pIm building a kind of small CMS wich needs to be accessed from multiple Domains.p  peg.p  pCMS is installed on www.maindomain.com and needs to be accessed by domain1.com domain2.com ...p  pif domain1.com is called, it must display the content from maindomain.comindex.phpwebdomain1 domain1.comsomepath...  maindomain.comindex.phpwebdomain1amppathsomepath..p  pI dont want to copy my CMS to every domain so the domains need to access the CMS from maindomain.com.p  pMy first try was to just include the main CMS via PHP require by using an absolute path.. this causes several problems because I would need to chance the server configphp.ini allowurlinclude wich might not work on a small webspace without root access. And if maindomain.com uses require without absolute paths, the file cant be found..p  pThe only solution I found so far is to create a reverse proxy redirect from domain1.com to maindomain.comindex.phpwebdomain1 But this might not work with all Domain resellers  might not be good for search engines..p  pIm open to any solutions that would solve the problem.. but it should be if possible ok for SEO  work on servers without editing configs..p  pThanksp  p edit really no one had this  a similar problem beforep

Negative 11018 pI am building my first AngularJS app and am struggling to figure out how to organize my code into servicesfactories and directives.  My controller code keeps getting longer and longer and I know I must be doing something wrong.p  pOriginally my app had three controllers BuildingTypeController, AddressController, and LayoutController.  I used the ngcontroller directive to attach each controller to each of my fieldsets.  However I encountered problems whenp  ol liI needed to pass one controllers data to another controller to be able to use in the scope.watch code.li liWhen I needed to pass one controllers data to another controller in my Get... http.get methods replaced with hardcoded values in my code below.li ol  pSo then I went back and took all of my properties and functions and through them in one big FormController.  This gives me the functionality Im looking for, however I know this cant possibly be the right way to organize all of this code.p  pIf anyone could offer any advice on how to structure a long controller into smaller pieces I would greatly appreciate it.  Thank youp  pEDIT The hardcoded datasets in this code were created to allow for the fiddle to work  they will be replaced with database calls and should not be factored into the length of the single

Negative 11018 pIm configuring what I believe to be a fairly simple Unicast NLB in 2003 with 2 NICs per node, but just want to be clear in the setup.  Im trying to understand a real life example set up similarly. p  pOn both NLB nodes there are two NICs.  One NIC is configured with corporate LAN settings on a 192.168.44.X range with gateway, dns settings, etc and the second NIC has an IP in 172.16.0.X range with just a subnet mask configured  this is a private range supposedly set up for cluster traffic.p  pI would like the cluster IP to be available in the 192.168.44.X range.  p  pMy question is, when configuring the cluster interfacehost IP through the NLB New Cluster Wizard, which NIC should be used p  pIn both the live example and a video I found on youtube, the corporate LAN NICs have apparently been used in the NLB wizard on a dual nic setup, however Ive not found an explanation as to why or what is going on with the cluster NICs under this config. They just seem to be presentp  pFrom labbing, the conclusion I reach is that you should configure with the Corporate LAN nics otherwise the cluster IP cannot be reached, but in order to get the NLB nodes to converge, a hosts file entry is required on each node for their respective for 172.16.0.X addresses, otherwise the nodes cant see each other.p
Negative 11018 pI followed this tutorial a hrefhttpsblahti.wordpress.com20120626imageswithclickableareas relnofollowhttpsblahti.wordpress.com20120626imageswithclickableareasap  pEverything works as far as it knowing what area of the screen I touch for testing I had it toast a number for each box. Here is a section of my color map a hrefhttpimgur.comNGBlGre relnofollowhttpimgur.comNGBlGrea on my cell and not sure how to embed image, can do so when home from work on pc p  pWhat I want to do, and have had no luck finding information on, is when one of the areas of the color map is touched, I want to place an image where the color map square is. I have small square images of the same pixel dimension as the squares in my color map. p  pThe overall goal of this is basically proper image placement with proper automatic scaling for different screen sizes. p  pRight now until I figure this out I have imagebuttons galore rather than using the color map, and everything has fixed sizes in a relative layout, which is obviously horribly inefficient and as it is, only works on screens 5.5 or larger. p  pI realize Im not the greatest at wording things, so by all means, if morebetter info is needed, just comment n say so and Ill do my best. p  pThanks allp
