Positive 1583 pIm displaying a listview with custom adapter. Each item of list view basically has a photo Imageview and a like FlipImageView button and a textView to show number of likes. I have populated the listview with 3 items. The weird issue is that when i click on the like button of second photo, there is no response no flipping of image and no change in number of likes. Instead the first photo like button responds and the number of likes of first photo got incremented. The second weird issue is that, the first item of listview isnt populated fully An imageview lies blank while imageview of other list items inflate fully. But when i scroll and come back to first item, it then gets inflated fully. Here is the Adapter code, xml file of each list Item, and the Listview itself.

Positive 1583 pI am creating a user control which contains 2 ListView controls. I want the user to be able to use Designer to set the Columns property for the user control and the 2 ListView controlsbasically, the Columns property for the user control and the 2 ListView controls are to be synced to each other, using the exact same ColumnHeader collections.p  pFor the user control itself, in order for the Columns property to work properly as a collection of column headers, I find I must inherit from System.Collections.ObjectModel.Collection. I set the collection class to Serializable and the class property to DesignerSerializationVisibilityDesignerSerializationVisibility.Content. When I do this, and use the user control on a form and add columns to the Columns property, I find in the forms Designer in InitializeComponents that the Add method of the collection class is used to add the ColumnHeader variables created. This works.p  pWhat I have trouble doing, however, is syncing the Columns collection property with the Columns properties of the 2 ListView controls. For the inherited collection class inherited from Collection, I cannot override the Add method, so I cant set the Add method to also add the ColumnHeader to the Columns properties of the 2 Listview controls.p  pHow do I assure that the Columns properties of the 2 ListView controls always change to match changes in the user controls Columns propertyp

The childlistview height is always adjusted to the number of items it has, therefore the scrollbar for it should not be used  never appear.p  pMy problem is, I want that when the user taps, holds, and tries to scroll ANYWHERE on the parentlist view, it should scroll the PARENT listview. This is for touchdevices. Unfortunately, I need the DataTemplate of the PARENT listview to be selectable. So when use tries to scroll, nothing happens.p  pI hope I make sense.p  pIs there anyway that I can trigger the Parent List View to scroll If I click on what appears to be the border between the DataTemplate and then try to scroll from there, it works properly, but I want to have a touchfriendly experience where it feels natural to be able to scroll from anywhere.p  pBelow is a rough code, I removed some of the unnecessary partsp  precodeltListView DragOverDragOver       AllowDropTrue  gt ltListView.ItemTemplategt     ltDataTemplategt             ltListView ManipulationModeNone                     SelectionModeSingle                     ScrollViewer.VerticalScrollBarVisibilityHidden                     CanDragItemsTrue DropListViewDrop DragItemsStartingDragStarting                     AllowDropTrue  DragOverDragOver DragLeaveDragLeave                   gt                 ltListView.ItemsPanelgt                     ltItemsPanelTemplategt                         ltStackPanel OrientationVertical gt                     ltItemsPanelTemplategt                 ltListView.ItemsPanelgt             ltListViewgt     ltDataTemplategt ltListView.ItemTemplategt ltListView.ItemsPanelgt     ltItemsPanelTemplategt         ltStackPanel OrientationVerticalgtltStackPanelgt     ltItemsPanelTemplategt ltListView.ItemsPanelgt codepre  pp  pThank youp

Positive 1583 pI am new to using both RecyclerView and Picasso. Essentially, what Im trying to do is  Pass a list of tweets to the adapter. In the OnBind method, Im using Picasso to load an image onto each cardif it exists. When I scroll up and down, cards in which the image had been loaded previously flicker and reload the image. The text doesnt flicker. The flickering happens only in the case of images.p  pI tried using setItemViewCacheSizeint size on the recyclerview object. This function caches the specified number of items and gave me the smooth User experience which I was looking for.

Positive 1583 pthe problem is that I made a listview and an adapter, and on the click of the button for each element of the adapter, the adapter must return the user name in white, the problem is that when they click items that are not displayed on startup in listview, it assigns the name again as if the seventh was the first on the eighth was the second, some way to solvep  pHere are some examples

To differentiate itemName and itemPrice from scanner resultplain text i used string tokenizer class then i can get itemName and Price seperately. p  pThe solution should be while a user scanned an item it should display item Name and item Price separately in the list View. The problem is how to use a String and Integer can use to implement this system.p  precodeStringTokenizer tokenizer  new StringTokenizerscanRes,     itmName  tokenizer.nextToken    itmPrice  Integer.valueOftokenizer.nextToken codepre  pAnd im passing the result to a String name scanRes mentioned above code through this statement.p  precodeqrResult.setTextintent.getStringExtraSCANRESULT String scanRes  intent.getStringExtraSCANRESULT codepre  pi want to view the assigned values in two variables mentioned aboveitmName  and itmPrice into a ListView. I have implemented a solution bt it needs String array to pass values. Bt i need to pass the values saved in this two Variables. Ill post below the solution i have created. Thanks a lot if anyone can tell what are the things i have to change in the Code.p  pThis is the code for strongScanner Activitystrong Class. And its giving an error for the onItemClick method at the bottom.p  precodepublic class QRScanMenu extends Activity  String itmName Integer itmPrice Override protected void onCreateBundle savedInstanceState      super.onCreatesavedInstanceState     setContentViewR.layout.qrscannermenu      HandleClick handleClick  new HandleClick     findViewByIdR.id.QRButton.setOnClickListenerhandleClick     findViewByIdR.id.ExitButton.setOnClickListenerhandleClick      private class HandleClick implements View.OnClickListener     public void onClickView arg0         try             Intent intent  new Intentcom.google.zxing.client.android.SCAN             switch arg0.getId                 case R.id.QRButton                     intent.putExtraSCANMODE, QRCODEMODE                     break                  case R.id.ExitButton                     Intent i  new IntentQRScanMenu.this, MainActivity.class                     startActivityi                     break                          startActivityForResultintent, 0                  catch ActivityNotFoundException ex             showDialogQRScanMenu.this, No Scanner Application Found, Download Scanner Application, Yes, No.show                 private static AlertDialog showDialogfinal Activity activity, CharSequence title, CharSequence message, CharSequence btnYes, CharSequence btnNo     AlertDialog.Builder downloadDialog  new AlertDialog.Builderactivity     downloadDialog.setTitletitle     downloadDialog.setTitlemessage     downloadDialog.setPositiveButtonbtnYes, new DialogInterface.OnClickListener          Override         public void onClickDialogInterface dialog, int which              Uri uri  Uri.parsemarketsearchqpname  com.google.zxing.client.android             Intent intent  new IntentIntent.ACTIONVIEW, uri             try                  activity.startActivityintent              catch ActivityNotFoundException ex                                  downloadDialog.setNegativeButtonbtnNo, new DialogInterface.OnClickListener          Override         public void onClickDialogInterface dialog, int which                     return downloadDialog.show   public void onActivityResultint reqCode, int resCode, Intent intent     if reqCode  0         TextView qrStatus  TextView findViewByIdR.id.statusText         TextView qrResult  TextView findViewByIdR.id.resultText         ListView listView  ListView findViewByIdR.id.qrItmList          ifresCode  RESULTOK             qrStatus.setTextintent.getStringExtraSCANRESULTFORMAT             qrResult.setTextintent.getStringExtraSCANRESULT             String scanRes  intent.getStringExtraSCANRESULT             StringTokenizer tokenizer  new StringTokenizerscanRes,              itmName  tokenizer.nextToken             final String[] newd  new String[1]             newd[1]itmName             itmPrice  Integer.valueOftokenizer.nextToken             Integer[] newI  new Integer[1]             newI[1]itmPrice              customList adapter  new customListQRScanMenu.this, newd, newI             listView.setAdapteradapter             listView.setOnClickListenernew AdapterView.OnItemClickListener                 public void onItemClickAdapterViewltgt parent, View view, int position, long id                     Toast.makeTextQRScanMenu.this, You Clicked at newd, Toast.LENGTHSHORT.show                                              adapter.additmName             adapter.additmPrice                  else if resCode  RESULTCANCELED             qrStatus.setTextPress QR Scan button to Scan Item             qrResult.setTextScan Cancelled                 codepre  pIve used this String Arrays for Testing purposes.

Im using C and .NET 3.0p  pI have a very nice, extensible framework built on top of WCF that automates the setup of endpoints and the creation of contracts.  The system Im working in could be run in different ways  endpoints could be somewhere else on the internet, running in different assemblies on the same box, or even running in the same process.  WCF is great for making all of this transparent, but in the last case, Id like to improve efficiencyp  pId love to avoid the overhead of serializing objects that arent really going anywhere.  Theres really no point in doing that to communicate between two threads in the same assembly.  At the same time, Id like to utilize the WCFbased framework thats already in place, because it will be a lot easier to maintain if we dont have two separate communications pathways depending on the setup of the system.p  pMy first thought was to use object pointers in an unsafe context  to not fight the serialization, but to only serialize the minimum amount.  My concern with this is that on asynchronous messages in environments where the GC is being aggressive, the message might and probably will be gone before we have a chance to dereference the pointer contained in it, which would lead to plenty of issues.p  pMy next thought was to use GCHandles, but Im unsure about their behavior  if a GCHandle isnt referenced anymore, but contains a reference to a managed object, are both cleaned up by the GC, or neither  Im worried about introducing a huge memory leak by using these, because the chance that a message will get lost is great, and we wont be able to call Free, and the documentation I can find is... lacking.p  pAnother thought is to use reflection to look at all managed objects, but it seems like the overhead for this would be huge, and this system must be as efficient as possible.p  pSo, in summary, Im trying to send an object across a process with WCF without serializing it, which as far as I can tell means keeping it alive even if it temporarily has no references.  It seems like it should be possible, but I wonder if Im trying to have my cake and eat it too.p  pThank you so much for your inputp

Negative 1583 pIm fleshing out a WPF business application in my head and one thing that sparked my interest was how I should handle making it incredibly modular. For example, my main application would simply contain the basics to start the interface, load the modules, connect to the server, etc. These modules, in the form of class libraries, would contains their own logic and WPF windows. Modules could define their own resource dictionaries and all pull from the main applications resource dictionary for common brushes and such.p  pWhats the best way to implement a system of this nature How should the main interface be built so that the modules it loads can alter virtually any aspect of its user interface and logicp  pI realize its a fairly vague question, but Im simply looking for general input and brainstorming.p  pThanksp

Negative 1583 pI have an interesting at least to me problem  I cant manage to find a way to reliably and portably get information on grandchildren processes in certain cases.  I have an application, a hrefhttpalltray.trausch.us relnofollowAllTraya, that I am trying to get to work in certain strange cases where its subprocess spawns a child and then dies.  AllTrays job is essentially to dock an application to the task tray, which is usually specified as a command line for AllTray to invoke i.e., codealltray xtermcode would start xterm, and manage it in AllTray.p  pMost GUI software runs just fine under it.  It sets the codeNETWMPIDcode property on its window or a widget library does and alls well, because codeNETWMPIDcode  codeforkcodeed child.  However, in some cases such as when running codeoowritercode, or software written to run under KDE such as K3b, the child process that AllTray runs is a wrapper, be it a shell script as in OO.os case or a strange program that codeforkcodes and codeexeccodes itself and effectively backgrounds itself, since the parent process dies very early.p  pI had the idea to not reap my child processes, so as to preserve in the process table the parent process ID for my grandchildren, so that I could link them back to me by traversing the family tree from bottomtotop.  That doesnt work, though  once my child process dies and turns into a zombie, the system considers my grandchild process to be an orphan, and codeinitcode adopts it.  This appears to be the case on at least Linux 2.6 and NetBSD Id presume its probably the norm, and POSIX doesnt seem to specify that to be the case, so I was hoping for the opposite.p  pSince that approach wont work, I thought about using codeLDPRELOADcode and intercepting my child process call to codeforkcode, and passing information back to my parent process.  However, Im concerned that wont be as portable as the ideal solution, because different systems have different rules on how the dynamic linker does things like codeLDPRELOADcode.  It wont work for setuidsetgid GUI applications either without the helper library also being setuid or setgid, at least on Linux systems.  Generally, it smells like a bad idea to me, and feels quite hackish.p  pSo, Im hoping that someone has an idea on how to do this, or if the idea of relying on a mechanism like codeLDPRELOADcode is really the only option I have short of patching kernels which is emnotem going to happen.p

Negative 1583 pI have some trouble getting my head around how to implement more complex operations in a Domain Service in RIA Services. This is all Silverlight 4, VS 2010 and .Net Framework 4 in Beta 2.p  h2Goalh2  pI wish I could create an operation on my LinqToEntitiesDomainService that would have a signature something like this p  precodepublic UnwieldyOperationResult PerformUnwieldyOperation UnwieldyOperationParameters p  codepre  pThe idea is that this operation takes a colleciton of parameters and performs rather complex operations which would update different instances and types of the entities that are otherwise manipulated through the DomainService CRUD functionality.p  h2Problemh2  pThe immediate problem i hit is that does not seem to be allowed to pass the custom type as parameter to the method, and I suppose something along those lines go for the return value. I want to encapsulate the operation parameters in a DTO for clarity, and this unwieldy operation does not have any corresponding entity in the legacy database that I have wrapped with Entity Framework 4.0 model, which I am in turn basing the Domain Service on.p  pIs a domain service supposed to deal with only the types that are entities in the underlying EF model Is it not designed to expose more complex operations like my UnwieldyOperationp  pIf so, can I build another service somehow that allows both the operation signature and to manipulate the entity framework p  pI have understood that only emoneem Domain Service can handle an entity from the model. This has led me to cram all the CRUD and now also the UnwieldyOperation into one Domain Service, although my first idea was to split the service into smaller parts.p  pIf Id get the operation to work with parameters and return value in the Domain Service, my next wish would be to have the entities that are already loaded in the domain context at the client refresh themselves. p  pIs there any efficient mechanism for such a thing p  pHow would you go about to do thatp  h2What I have so far...h2  pIn short, this is what I have so farp  ul lipI have wrapped an existing legacy database with an Entity Framework 4.0 model with as little extra paddingcode as possible. This means rightclick, add and generate from database. pli lipI have implemented the simpler CRUD operations in the DomainService and I am using them successfully to display and edit straight forward data. I have some encapsulation of logic through ViewModels in client but I expose the Entity classes directly, but I think this is unrelated to my problemquestion. pli lipI have realized that I cant add the UnwieldyOperation in an as straight forward manner as I initially thought... Also I suspecthope that I have misunderstood some aspects of the Domain Service mechanism, which has led me to the current situation.pli ul  h2One way to goh2  pWriting this down in a question like this gives me the idea that perhaps Id go in this directionp  ol liLegacyModelService expose the CRUD operations as I have already done.li liExpose the Unwieldy operations in another service. Should I make that a RIA Doamin Service or just plain WCFli liAccess the Entity Framework model from the new UnwieldyOperationsService and manipulate the data layer there.li liExplicitly reload or refresh the client domain context for the LegacyModelService at the client to reflect the changes that may have resultet from the UnwieldyOperation.

Negative 1583 h2General Problemh2  pThough I may be diagnosing the root cause of an event, determining how many users it affected, or distilling timing logs in order to assess the performance and throughput impact of a recent code change, my tools stay the same codegrepcode, codeawkcode, codesedcode, codetrcode, codeuniqcode, codesortcode, codezcatcode, codetailcode, codeheadcode, codejoincode, and codesplitcode. To glue them all together, Unix gives us pipes, and for fancier filtering we have codexargscode. If these fail me, theres always codeperl ecode.p  pThese tools are perfect for processing CSV files, tabdelimited files, log files with a predictable line format, or files with commaseparated keyvalue pairs. In other words, files where each line has next to no context.p  h2XML Analoguesh2  pI recently needed to trawl through Gigabytes of XML to build a histogram of usage by user. This was easy enough with the tools I had, but for more complicated queries the normal approaches break down. Say I have files with items like thisp  precodeltfoo usermegt     ltbaz keyzoidberg valuesquid gt     ltbaz keyleela    valuecyclops gt     ltbaz keyfry      valuerube gt ltfoogt codepre  pAnd lets say I want to produce a mapping from user to average number of codeltbazgtcodes per codeltfoogtcode. Processing linebyline is no longer an option I need to know which users codeltfoogtcode Im currently inspecting so I know whose average to update. Any sort of Unix one liner that accomplishes this task is likely to be inscrutable.p  pFortunately in XMLland, we have wonderful technologies like XPath, XQuery, and XSLT to help us.p  pPreviously, I had gotten accustomed to using the wonderful codeXMLXPathcode Perl module to accomplish queries like the one above, but after finding a a hrefhttpditchnet.orgxmlmateTextMate Plugin that could run an XPath expression against my current windowa, I stopped writing oneoff Perl scripts to query XML. And I just found out about a hrefhttpxmlstar.sourceforge.netXMLStarleta which is installing as I type this and which I look forward to using in the future.p  h2JSON Solutionsh2  pSo this leads me to my question are there any tools like this for JSON Its only a matter of time before some investigation task requires me to do similar queries on JSON files, and without tools like XPath and XSLT, such a task will be a lot harder. If I had a bunch of JSON that looked like thisp  precode   firstName Bender,   lastName Robot,   age 200,   address      streetAddress 123,     city New York,     state NY,     postalCode 1729   ,   phoneNumber [      type home, number 666 5551234 ,      type fax, number 666 5554567    ]  codepre  pAnd wanted to find the average number of phone numbers each person had, I could do something like this with XPathp  precodefnavgfncountphoneNumber codepre  h2Questionsh2  ol liAre there any commandline tools that can query JSON files in this wayli liIf you have to process a bunch of JSON files on a Unix command line, what tools do you useli liHeck, is there even work being done to make a query language like this for JSONli liIf you do use tools like this in your daytoday work, what do you likedislike about them Are there any gotchasli ol  pIm noticing more and more data serialization is being done using JSON, so processing tools like this will be crucial when analyzing large data dumps in the future.

Negative 1583 pAfter the introduction of Java Memory Model, the Swing guidelines were changed to state that any Swing components need to be instantiated on the EDT in order to avoid nonpublished instance state. p  pWhat I could not find anywhere is whether the classloading is also mandated to be on the EDT or can we preload key Swing classes in a background thread Is there any official statement from SunOracle on this Are there any classes that are known to hold nonthreadsafe static state, hence need to be loaded on EDT p  pbClarification to address Nemis questionb this is a practical issue.  A sizable portion of our applications startup time, is spent classloading, and fontimageloading on the EDT. Most of this can be attributed to Swing and related libraries. p  pHere is som background As many other Swing apps, on startup we are preconstructing many forms, in order to make the UI more responsive. After profiling, we found that the actual time for form construction is relatively fast  whats slow is loading of all classes and fonts disk reads are emslowem in corporate setup with onaccess virus scanner, surveilance scanner, audit tracker and god knows what else tacked on the HDD driver. p  pWe tried to construct the same forms in a background thread violating Swings rules and then throw them away. Once we are done we construct the same forms on the EDT, which is much faster as all classes are loaded and any other files are in the disk cache. It works for us, and well probably keep doing it unless something really bad happens. p  pWhat Im asking is whether this is a safe practice, a good practice or a hackp

Negative 1583 pIn java, I might have an object emaem with a bunch of properties like getColor.  I then might make a second object embem possibly of the same class that behaves similarly to object emaem in the sense that it does the same thing as emaem unless one of its values is specifically changed and unchanged, too.  p  precodea  new Foo b  new FooWhichRefersToAnotherFooa  a.getColor  returns blue b.getColor  returns blue a.setColorred b.getColor  returns red b.setColorpink b.getColor  returns pink a.getColor  returns red unchanged b.deleteChangeToColor b.getColor  returns red as it is now pointing back to a codepre  pI would assume it would be some kind of tree hierarchy as if I had emcem pointing to embem pointing to emaem, the object would work up the chain to the first specified value or the default value of the original unparented object.  p  pDoes a pattern like this exist similar that works well with java  I would expect the first class would be one class, and the second would be an inherited class, which keeps track of which class its instancing, and if its own property is not set, queries the parent object.  p  pI figure I can do this myself where every class I make, I can create a separate class likep  precodeclass Foo    Color color  new Colorred   Color getColor  color    class FooInstance extends Foo    Foo parent  null    FooInstanceFoo parent      this.parent  parent       Color getColor      if color  null return parent.getColor     else return color     codepre  pbut wanted to make sure there wasnt some easier mechanism for that like using javabeans or something.  One problem with inheritance is it exposes all the methods of the parent, while Id like to possibly specify which ones are actually available in the child, so maybe just a separate class altogether  p

Negative 1583 pI have a product with a straightforward REST API so that users of the product can directly integrate with the products features without using my web user interface.p  pRecently I have been getting interest from various third parties about integrating their desktop clients with the API to allow users of my product to access their data using that third party application.p  pIve seen that applications that want to use Twitter authenticate using a login page hosted by Twitter that grants a specific application permission to access that users data. You click the Allow or Deny button and the authentication process is complete. Facebook uses the same mechanism as best I can tell.p  pUpon further research, this seems to be OAuth in action, and seeing as my API is .Netbased, I am thinking I should use DotNetOpenAuth and provide a similar mechanism. Unfortunately the samples are sparsely documented if at all and the only tutorials I can find online seem to be focussed on helping you provide a login mechanism for your users so that they can log into your website using a third party provider.p  pWhat I would emreallyem like to do is have my REST API handle all of the core authentication and business logic for my web application and have, under the hood, my web application essentially be another application that just uses the API via OAuth. Users would authenticate on the website either directly using their username and password, or via a third party provider such as MyOpenID or Facebook and then the website would somehow use the returned token to authenticate against the REST API.p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comneKuF.png altArchitectural Diagramp  pIt basically looks like I need my API to somehow host an OAuth service, but also have users use a third party OAuth service. I cant help but think I dont quite have enough of a grasp on OAuth to decide if Im overcomplicating things or if what Im trying to do is a good or bad way to do things.p  pCan someone give me at least a broad overview of the steps I need to undertake, or what I should look at to make this happen Or point me at some tutorials Or blast my proposal and tell me Im going about this architecturally all wrongp

Negative 1583 pI have a WCF service, hosted in IIS. On the service, I have about 20 methods in the service. I would like to secure SOME of those methods with usernamepassword.  I dont have any control over the clients that are calling the service, so I cant install a certificate on the client.  Our services act as a platform, holding all the user profile information, including login information.  p  pI THINK that I would like the clients to authenticate once to the Authenticateusername,password method on the WCF service, get an authorization token back, and pass that token for subsequent calls. Sort of like Asp.net membership providers use of forms auth sessions.  I dont want the client to have to pass the usernamepassword for every method call, if possible. Is this the right pattern Is there a better way to get this feature to work using standard WCF functionality  Does anybody have any sample configcode to show the right way to get this to workp

Negative 1583 pIm wondering about the merits of creating a small library, probably for personal use which specifies a few data structures such as Linked Lists, Trees Binary, AVL, etc..., Hash Lookup Tables, and the like.p  pSome of these would be built on top of the native PHP array, as it acts as many of these types, and some potentially wouldnt.p  pMy question is really, would it make sense to build any of these classes  especially those which may not build upon the native array Im talking here about the computational practicality, and dont especially want to get into the dynamic vs. typed language argument Im still interested in hearing anything interesting and relevant on that topic as an aside.p  pIs it mad to build these possibly more efficient, logically datastructures using classes when we have a C implementation of a basic arrayp  pThanks..p

Negative 1583 pIm using NetBeanss Web Service generation tools. Ive looked at the tutorials available, but cannot find anything on how to use a custom class as a return type. Most of the tutorials Ive read are no more complex than Hello World they take and return simple types like Strings.p  pSo say I want a class that has 3 fields a String, an int and a double[]. So far, the only way I can pass my own classes is by creating envelope classes, with no methods, a parameterless constructor, and with all fields declared public.

Obviously I cannot send the methods across SOAP, but I would have thought there was a way to ignore the methods when Marshalling the class, and only Marshall the fields.p  pSomebody has told me there are Annotations that facilitate this, but I cant find any tutorials on how to implement them. Any guidance would be greatly appreciated.p

Negative 1583 pThese days Im working on simulating modal dialog in Android. Ive googled a lot, theres much discussions but sadly theres not much options to get it modal.

Use a dialogthemed activity, like this a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions2879914howtoforcemainacivitytowaitforsubactivityinandroidthreada said, but I still cant make main activity truly wait for dialogactivity return. Main activity turned to stop status and got restarted then.br 2. Build one worker thread, and use thread synchronization. However, its a huge refactoring job for my app, now I have a single main activity and a service both in main UI thread.br 3. Take over event handling within a loop when there is a modal dialog up, and quit loop when dialog gets closed. Actually its the way to build a real modal dialog like what it exactly does in Windows. I still havent prototyped this way.p  pId still like to simulate it with a dialogthemed activity,br 1. start dialogactivity by startActivityForResultbr 2. get result from onActivityResultbr Heres some sourcep  precodepublic class MainActivity extends Activity   Override public void onCreateBundle savedInstanceState      super.onCreatesavedInstanceState      MyView v  new MyViewthis     setContentViewv   private final int RESULTCODEALERT  1 private boolean mAlertResult  false public boolean startAlertDialog      Intent it  new Intentthis, DialogActivity.class     it.putExtraAlertInfo, This is an alert     startActivityForResultit, RESULTCODEALERT       I want to wait right here     return mAlertResult   Override protected void onActivityResult int requestCode, int resultCode, Intent data      switch requestCode      case RESULTCODEALERT         Bundle ret  data.getExtras         mAlertResult  ret.getBooleanAlertResult         break        codepre  pThe caller of startAlertDialog will block execution and expect returned result. But startAlertDialog returned immediately of course, and main activity went into STOP status while DialogActivity was up.  p  pSo the question is, how to make main activity really wait for resultbr Thanks.p

Negative 1583 pTrying to learn ASP.NET with several years of classic ASP development under the belt, and struggling with the myriad server controls for rendering data.  p  pIm trying to pivot data using serverside data objects.  A good example is a table of Customers with three columns  1 customer id, 2 customer name 3 nested list of Order ids.  There is, of course, a onetomany relationship between Customers and Orders.  In classic ASP, I would have used two arraysone for Customers and one for Ordersand I would have iterated through the Orders array once for each iteration of the Customers array, pulling out the appropriate Order records as needed.    p  pInstead, Im trying to take advantage of the .NET framework controls, so Im thinking that Ill dump the Orders into a DataTable, and then Ill create a GridView for the Customers data, with a custom TemplateField that calls to a sub that loops through the Orders DataTable and binds the right records to some sort of object ListView  Literal that then gets bound to the appropriate row in the Customers GridView.   p  pIs this right  Am I picking the right controls to use for this purpose  Im tempted to just use VB arrays and do it the way Ive always done it mashing together a string of HTML with repeated concatenations, but Im trying to make an effort to harness the efficiency of the framework.p  pThanks for any guidance.  p

The reason that codeunsigned int64int0xF0000000code is sign extended is because, as noted by user a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comusers379897rRap  blockquote   pConversion of a signed type or any type to an unsigned type   strongalwaysstrong takes place via reduction modulo one plus the max value of   the destination type.p blockquote  pAnd in codeunsigned int640xF0000000code  0xF0000000 starts off as an unsigned integer type because it cannot fit in an integer type. Next that already unsigned type is converted codeunsigned int64code.p  pSo the takeaway from this for me is with a function thats returning a 32bit or 64bit pointer as an codeunsigned int64code to compare I must first convert the 32bit pointer in my 32bit application to an unsigned type before promoting to codeunsigned int64code.

Negative 1583 pYes, Im aware of that the following question could be answered with Use the lock keyword instead or something similar. But since this is just for fun, I dont care about those.p  pIve made a simple lock using atomic operationsp  precodepublic class LowLock       volatile int locked  0      public void EnterAction action              var s  new SpinWait          while true                      var inLock  locked  releasefence read               If CompareExchange equals 1, we won the race.             if Interlocked.CompareExchangeref locked, 1, inLock  1                              action                 locked  0  acquire fence write                 break  exit the while loop                          else s.SpinOnce  lost the race. Spin and try again.                 codepre  pIm using the lock above in a simple for loop, that adds a string to a normal codeListltstringgtcode, with the purpose of making the codeaddcode method threadsafe, when wrapped inside the codeEntercode method from a codeLowLockcode.p  pThe code looks likep  precodestatic void Mainstring[] args      var numbers  new Listltintgt      var sw  Stopwatch.StartNew     var cd  new CountdownEvent10000      for int i  0 i lt 10000 i              ThreadPool.QueueUserWorkItemo gt                      low.Enter gt numbers.Addi             cd.Signal                    cd.Wait     sw.Stop      Console.WriteLineTime  0  results  1, sw.ElapsedMilliseconds, numbers.Count      Console.ReadKey  codepre  pNow the tricky part is that when the main thread hits the codeConsole.WriteLinecode that prints time and number of elements in the list, the number of elements should be equal to the count given to the codeCountdownEventcode 10000  It works most of the time, but sometimes theres only 9983 elements in the list, other times 9993. What am I overlookingp

Negative 1583 pBefore I launch into the specifics of the issues I am facing, I just need to ask Is it a mistake to use IE8 as the reference for building a website, particularly one that uses JavaScript animation I ask because I have written a fairly simple animation page, mostly from scratch, even with my weak grasp of HTML and JavaScript languages, using IE8 to monitor the progress. I have tweaked the code so that it works just fine in IE8 compatibility mode turned off, but when I tried it in Safari and Chrome, it does some weird hiccuping in the animation.p  pI find a lot of questions with the opposite problem that it works well in everything but IE. So I am wondering, should I be using a different browser for my reference Or is there a better approach to make it compatible with all browsers Its so frustrating as I am sure most of you will agree to have to deal with the different interpretations of the different browsers.p  pThanks for any helpp  pp.s. I have not coded yet for Mozilla.p

Negative 1583 pI know there are many questions like this one on SO, but I havent found a good solution so far. The best solutions Ive seen are homegrown, but before implementing a custom tool, Id like to hear your take. So here we gop  pstrongI have a .NET solution with a couple of web applications and a few windows services. I want to automate the rollout of these applications to, say, 1020 different servers  but the appweb.config files on each server may have different values.strongp  pMicrosofts answer to this issue is to have 1020 different web.config files locally on the dev machine, and then using configuration manager to choose the right one. But thats not good enough, because emthe developers dont know about the production server settings, nor should theyemp  pThe ideal solution would be to include a deployment model of some sort where the production servers and their settings are defined, and which could be used with some deployment script could be codePowershellcode as a step in the build server Im using codeTeamCitycode. This could be done by replacing the config settings before XCopying the solution to the remote server. But its a tedious and time consuming task.p  pAnother solution could be to use configSource to point to a folder with a fixed name, but the problem here is that some parts of the config files such as serviceModel cant be used with configSource.p  pSo I havent found the best answer to this.

Negative 1583 pI wrote a method for searching an object in my arralist, however I need this search to take two parameters and compare them to the description of the object.

Negative 1583 pWell Im currently refactoring a class I made quite a long time ago. The class is a container type.p  pMany functions can use advantage of the class structure, and are thus implemented as member functions. However it now seems to be a lot of function which seem the same, ie a find functionp  precodeiterator findITEM constiterator findITEM const iterator findifITEM, PRED constiterator findifITEM, PRED const codepre  p4 functions to describe nearly the same and code is almost the same in each version. This becomes very tedious when updating the class, I have to make sure each version is upgraded. Is there a manner to handle these things better Some other function in the class emCANem possibly take 2 predicates, and that meant I suddenly had 8 functions to manage.p  pI tried calling the nonconstant version from the constant version but that obviously doesnt work.p  pSo how does one handle these things Just bite the bullet and write it downp  pEDIT just to inform my datastructure resembles a tree. Each object contains the data which the find searches and a list with subtrees. The find function works recursive over all subtrees of a tree and subsub trees.  Just like one would expect when searching a tree.p  pAs there isnt a clear end or start iterator to such a tree, using stdfind doesnt yield the correct functionality.p

And result in writing more code for little benefit.p  pAre there other common techniques for accomplishing the tasks  like get the name value from table row xp  pI should also note that I am generating my tables with javascript so I dont think I have to worry about the issue of how different browsers may or may not consider whitespace a childNode.p

Negative 1583 pIm currently working with loading a lot thousands of files from 1KB  6MB XML files, and loading them into destination databases. Currently, Im using the SQLXMLBULKLOAD COM object. One of the biggest problems Im having is that the COM object doesnt always play nice within our transactional environment. Theres other problems too, such as performance the process really begins choking on files approaching 2MB, taking several minutes, if not longer in some cases hours, to load into the tables.p  pSo now Im looking for an alternative, of which there seems to be two flavorsp  p1 Something like OPENXML, where XML is inserted as XML data into SQL Serverp  porp  p2 Solutions that parse the XML in memory, and load as rowsets into the database.p  pTheres drawbacks to either approach, and I know Im going to have to start doing some benchmarking of prototype solutions before I jump to any conclusions. The OPENXML approach is very attractive IMO, mainly because it promises some really good performance numbers others claiming going from hours to milliseconds. But it has the drawback of storing data as XML not ideal in my particular scenario since the destination tables already exist, and many other processes rely on queries and SPROCS out there that query these tables as normal rowset data.p  pWhatever solution I choose, I must meet the following requirementsp  p1 Must accept any XML file. Clients in a business sense need only provide an XSD, and an appropriate destination databasetables for the data.p  p2 Individual files never larger than 6MB must be processed in under 1 minute ideally even much quicker than that.p  p3 Inserted data must be able to accomodate existing queries and SPROCS i.e, must ultimately end up as normal rowset datap  pSo my question is, do you have any experience in this situation, and what are your thoughts and insightsp  pI am not completely opposed to an OPENXMLlike solution, just as long as the data can end up as normal rowset data at some point. I am also interested in 3rd party solutions you may have experience with, this is an important part of our process, and we are willing to spend some  if it provides us the best and most stable solution.p  pIm also not opposed to rollyourown suggestions, or things on Codeplex, etc. I came across the LINQ to XSD project, but couldnt find much documentation about what its capabilitities are just as an exame of things I am interested inp

Negative 1583 pI am just trying to understand the mechanics behind this. There are two queriesp  precodeSELECT SQLNOCACHE count id  AS cnt FROM users GROUP BY country SELECT SQLNOCACHE id FROM users GROUP BY country codepre  pid is primary, country is not indexed. Why does query with count take much longer to run. From my understanding in order to GROUPBY contents of the table, you anyway need to walk through all of the rows If it is so, why it doesnt count as it groups things by Or if it is not so, how does it manage to groupby without going through all rows, how does it manage to skip some of them p

Negative 1583 pI am writing some code as part of a framework for opening a file.  The file is of custom type and should not be opened by more than one instance of my application.  To stop multiple file opening I use a filestream to create a lock file and then keep said filestream open.p  pThis seems to work in preventing another instance of my application from opening the file  as it will fail in recreating the lock stream in the files open code  but if the file is on a network share and the network drops then the original application also can not access the file any more.p  pThe code to get the lock stream is as followsp  precodeTry          We need to keep this stream alive to prevent other applications gaining access to the lock         mLockStream  New FileStreammLockPath, FileMode.CreateNew, FileAccess.Write, FileShare.None     Catch ex As UnauthorizedAccessException     Catch ex As DirectoryNotFoundException         Throw     Catch ex As IOException         Throw New ProjectInUseExceptionMy.Resources.LocalizedResources.ProjectInUseExceptionMessage, Nothing     End Try codepre  pIn this I create the lock stream the first time round and then if another application tries to create it, it throws an exception and stops them from getting any further. This is kind of how it needs to work, unfortunately as I said, if this is done across a network and then the network connection is dropped for some reason then I can not delete the lock stream as I get an IOException telling me a process cannot access the file as it is open in another process  which shouldnt be happening I dont think.p  pI hope this makes some sense, I have looked around but found nothing about this particular kind of scenario so I thought Id see if anyone on here has had any similar experience.p  pcheers.p

Negative 1583 pI have a macrobased file built in Excel 2010.  It contains sensitive data.  In order to prevent the sensitive data from being disseminated willy nilly, Ive created a password to the file.  Ive also created macros that prevent saving the file as anything other than a PDF.  So basically, Ive done everything I can think of to prevent the file from being sent out in its excel format.p  pHowever, my clever or not so clever users have found an inadvertent workaround.  If they fill out the form and then just hit the Send as Attachment option in Excel, they can send out the file prefilled with data and having all functionality intact.  This circumvents my security measures and also annoys me because Ive told the users specifically NOT to send out this file.p  pIn researching online, it seems there is no way to turn off the email as attachment function.  There also does not seem to be any way to detect an email event something equivalent to the BeforePrint event.  I was wondering if the StackOverflow community might have any suggestions on how to resolve this.p

For .NET 4, it will automatically install it for the user if it is missing. However, the other requirements are not installed automaically. The best I have managed is for the installer to prompt the user asking if they want to download the prereq now, yes or no I have used the Install Url property of the launch condition to take them to the correct location. After the user has manually installed them they need to run our addin installer again.p  pWhat I am looking for is a way for my installer to automatically install the missing prereqs without pausing the installation, and without the user having to take uneccessary steps. Whether this means including the prereqs in the installer file somehow or getting the installer to do the download work.p  pThere is also a concern that because I have manually entered the Install url, it may become invalid at some point. Is there a more standardised way of doing this sort of thing that I am missingp  pThe app is not for internal use and we dont run IIS for deployemnet etc, out systems are mostly linux based. So we ideally want a single installer wuch as an MSI.p  pAny suggestions most welcomed.p  pRichardp

Negative 1583 pi am wondering i am trying to create a function which will create a set of drop down menus once the dialog box has been opened and not before...  i have made the php function and called it test i am wondering if there is a way to use javascript or maybe ajaxwhich seems like the most logical way to get this function to run once the dialog box appears.. its only a very small function which wouldnt take longer the a second to run. so really i am just looking for some advice on how i could get this to work.. in case i was confusing i am wanting to run a php function only once the dialog box has been opened and then when the dialog box is closed to remove whatever the function created.p  pbut with my very limited knowledge in ajax,javascript or jquery i cant really think of how to begin any help would be greatly appreciatedp

Negative 1583 pI am thinking about creating an open source data management web application for various types of data. p  pA privileged user must be able to p  ul liadd new entity types for example a user or a family li liadd new properties to entity types for example gender to userli liremovemodify entities and propertiesli ul  pThese will be common tasks for the privileged user. He will do this through the web interface of the application. In the end, all data must be searchable and sortable by all types of users of the application. Two questions trouble mep  pstronga How should the data be stored in the database Should I dynamically addremove database tables andor columns during runtimestrongp  pI am no database expert. I am stuck with the imagination that in terms of relational databases, the application has to be able to dynamically addremove tables entities andor columns properties at runtime. And I dont like this idea. Likewise, I am thinking if such dynamic data should be handled in a NoSQL database.p  pAnyway, I believe that this kind of problem has an intelligent canonical solution, which I just did not find and think of so far. emWhat is the best approach for this kind of dynamic data managementemp  pstrongb How to implement this in Python using an ORM or NoSQLstrongp  pIf you recommend using a relational database model, then I would like to use SQLAlchemy. However, I dont see how to dynamically create tablescolumns with an ORM at runtime. This is one of the reasons why I hope that there is a much better approach than creating tables and columns during runtime. emIs the recommended database model efficiently implementable with SQLAlchemyemp  pIf you recommend using a NoSQL database, which one I like using Redis  emcan you imagine an efficient implementation based on Redisemp  pThanks for your suggestionsp  pstrongEdit in response to some commentsstrongp  pThe idea is that all instances rows of a certain entity table share the same set of propertiesattributes columns. However, it will be perfectly valid if certain instances have an empty value for certain propertiesattributes.p  pBasically, users will search the data through a simple form on a website. They query for e.g. all instances of an entity E with property P having a value V higher than T. The result can be sorted by the value of any property.p  pThe datasets wont become too large. Hence, I think even the stupidest approach would still lead to a working system. However, I am an enthusiast and Id like to apply modern and appropriate technology as well as Id like to be aware of theoretical bottlenecks. I want to use this project in order to gather experience in designing a Pythonic, stateoftheart, scalable, and reliable web application.p  pI see that the first comments tend to recommending a NoSQL approach. Although I really like Redis, it looks like it would be stupid not to take advantage of the DocumentCollection model of MongoCouch. Ive been looking into mongodb and mongoengine for Python. By doing so, do I take steps into the right directionp  pstrongEdit 2 in response to some answerscommentsstrongp  pFrom most of your answers, I conclude that the dynamic creationdeletion of tables and columns in the relational picture is strongnotstrong the way to go. This already is valuable information. Also, one opinion is that the whole idea of the dynamic modification of entities and properties could be bad design.p  pAs exactly this dynamic nature should be the main purposefeature of the application, I dont give up on this. From the theoretical point of view, I accept that performing operations on a dynamic data model must necessarily be slower than performing operations on a static data model. This is totally fine.p  pExpressed in an abstract way, the application needs to managep  ol lithe emdata layoutem, i.e. a dynamic list of valid entity types and a dynamic list of properties for each valid entity typeli lithe emdata itselfemli ol  pI am looking for an intelligent and efficient way to implement this. From your answers, it looks like NoSQL is the way to go here, which is another important conclusion.p

Negative 1583 pat the moment I have a problem Im not sure how to solve this or how to find an idea how to fix.  I have a viewmodel that contains a child object. If I raise a command I reinitialize the ChildObject with new and add new data. After that my view updates and the new data is displayed. Sometimes its not reproducable when only one property is not updated anymore. There is no difference if I do this in the parent for the whole object or I do this with String.Empty.  One property is not updated and will stay as its old value the get method wont called. Once I was able to got this behaviour Im not able to update it by raising this command again.p  pCan somebody help me and know where such behaviours can occurep  pthanks,p  pstrongEDIT Sample code to make the problem visible.

Negative 1583 pI am trying to generate all possible combinations of a sequence of length k given a certain alphabet this is to generate query sequences for a bioinformatics project.p  pThe sequences are of the formp  pA first character and last character that can be any of A C G U call these Y and k  2 characters in between that can be any of A C G U or  call these X.p  pe.g. if k  3 then the pattern is of the form YXY and if k  5 then YXXXY.p  pGenerating all possible sequences if k is known is easy, as you can just use k nested for loops. But if k is not known in advance, then this implementation does not fit.p  pThe total number of possible sequences can be expressed by 42  5k2. With k  3 this only gives 80 combinations, but scale that up to k  9 and you have 1,250,000p  pAny tips, ideas or suggestions would be much appreciated.p  pI need to use every sequence generated, so they need to be either stored in an array, or passed at creationgeneration to another function, it doesnt really matter which, although I would prefer not to have to store all of them.p  pMany Thanks.p  pN.B.

Negative 1583 pI would like to see what you think of how to handle login on Android. I am working on an App right now that requires you to login in order to be useable.  I have two activities so far.  The home screen and the login screen.  I have set it up this way. p  pThe login screen is the main screen.  It asks the user to login.  If the login is successfull it starts the home screen and I call finish in the login activity.  When the user logs out, I finish the homescreen activity and start the login activity. p  pThis isnt working correctly because when I leave the app and then return, even after a successful login, the login screen shows up.  p  pI am thinking, that I will have to keep track of weather the user is logged in or not in a service.  Then the login activity will automatically start the home screen if I am logged in.  p  pAlternatively I can start the homescreen activity that will start the login screen if the user is not logged in.  p  pWhats the typical android pattern for this type of scenariop

Negative 1583 pI have a problem with converting a running totals string to a number.p  pThe running total is set to retrieve the maximum value of a field that contains results. It is reset with change of a group and evaluated by a formula so that only results from a specific test is used.br The result database field is a string since there are test with text results as well as tests with numeric results in the database. The test Im filtering out only have numeric results saved as string.p  pThe running total works fine and gives the correct result, but I want to change it from a string to a number to be able to set the number of decimals and use rounding in the report, and this is where my problem begins.p  ul liAs far as I can tell there is no way of using the format field in this case.

Negative 1583 pIm trying to install Wordpress with clean subversion repositories, as in a hrefhttpcodex.wordpress.orgInstallingWordPressWithCleanSubversionRepositories relnofollowhttpcodex.wordpress.orgInstallingWordPressWithCleanSubversionRepositoriesa. I have followed every step accordingly until the second last step, where it says You should now be able to view the site via the root URL httpexample.com, and indeed I can see my website on, say, a hrefhttpexample.com relnofollowhttpexample.coma. p  pOnce I go to the final step of changing the wpconfig.php though, a hrefhttpexample.com relnofollowhttpexample.coma draws a blank page. I am quite sure the wpconfig.php is the problem, i.e. Wordpress doesnt know that it should retrieve my wpcontent contents from emoutsideem the core Wordpress directory. My directory structure is as suchp  pcode.htaccesscodebr codecorecodebr codecustomcodebr codewpconfig.phpcodep  p, where core holds the files checked out with Subversion, custom holds my themes and plugins directory, and wpconfig.php contains the below linesp  pcodedefineWPCONTENTDIR, dirnameFILE . custom  defineWPCONTENTURL, httpexample.comcustomcodep  pI have tried other variations, likep  pcodedefineWPCONTENTDIR, SERVER[DOCUMENTROOT] . custom  defineWPCONTENTURL, httpexample.comcustomcodep  pI have also tried hardcoding the local path, likep  pcodedefineWPCONTENTDIR, homeMYUSERNAMEexample.comcustom  defineWPCONTENTURL, httpexample.comcustomcodep  p, but none of the above works. Then I renamed the custom folder to wpcontent, but again nothing. I even went into Dreamhost to prevent redirecting a hrefhttpexample.com relnofollowhttpexample.coma to a hrefhttpwww.example.com relnofollowhttpwww.example.coma and vice versa, but again to no avail. I dont believe core is the problem, because I can access the Dashboard via a hrefhttpexample.comcorewplogin.php relnofollowhttpexample.comcorewplogin.phpa, and the Dashboard says it cant detect my themes, which confirms my suspicion that WP doesnt know to retrieve the files from the custom folder.p  pBy now, I have run out of ideas as to where could the problem be. Can anyone experienced in this area please give me some advice Thanks a million. p
Negative 1583 pHow can I estimate the number of actors that a Scala program can handlep  pFor context, Im contemplating what is essentially a neural net that will be creating and forgetting cells at a high rate.  Im contemplating making each cell an actor, but there will be millions of them.  Im trying to decide whether this design is worth pursuing, but cant estimate the limits of number of actors.  My intent is that it should totally run on one system, so distributed limits dont apply.p  pFor that matter, I havent definitely settled on Scala, if theres some better choice, but the cells emdoem have state, as in, e.g., their connections to other cells, the weights of the connections, etc.  Though this COULD be done as Each cell is final.  Changes mean replacing the current cell with a new one bearing the same id.p  pP.S.  I dont know Scala.  Im considering picking it up to do this project.  Im also considering lots of other alternatives, including Java, Object Pascal and Ada.  But actors emseemem a better map to what Im after than threadpools and Java cant handle enough threads to make a threadcell design feasible.p  pP.S.  At all times, most of the actors will be quiescent, but there wil need to be a way of cycling through the entire collection of them.  If there isnt one built into the language, then this can be managed via firstnext links within each cell.  Both links are needed, to allow cells in the middle to be extracted for release.p

Negative 1583 pI am faced with the following problem. We are required to call the Twitter API to send a status update then we must write a record to a local database, recording that this Twitter update happened. p  pMy question is how can we ensure data consistency if either Twitter or the database calls fail If we update Twitter and the database call fails we will have no local record of the Twitter call and if the Twitter call fails but the database call succeeds we will have an erroneous local record.p  pI understand the obvious first steps such as only updating the DB if Twitter call is successful or viceversa but this only addresses half the problem. p  pI imagine that this is a common problem but I have tried searching for relevant information without much luck.p  pThank you,p  pStephenp

Negative 1583 pI have asked a similar question before, but after doing a rather thorough analysis on the matter, came to the conclusion that codegit filterbranchcode is the workhorse I am looking for. Either that or a shell script that does the dirty work in code.gitcode itself since git exposes its guts as part of its interface anyway.p  pI have a project directory which includes build scripts and build configuration definitions. More importantly, it includes codesrccode folder, which contains all kinds of source code for the project, and strongis a git repository.strongp  pI now realize that the entire project folder should be a git repository, not just the contained source code folder, but I wish to retain history of my source code development. In fact, I wish that the history is completely rewritten, so that instead of tracking changes in the file called say codemain.ccodeit trackes same content changes but in file codesrcmain.ccode. Then I can simply move files from the parent folder where the build scripts are and check them in the repo.p  pI dont want to bother with subtree merging or git submodules, or having to merge or reset anything after the repository is changed. I now have some fairly good knowledge of gits internals  commits refer to trees who refer to blobs paired with file names.p  pstrongWith this knowledge, I think it should be possible to rewrite my history, prefixing all paths with codesrccodestrongp  pI just dont want to do extra work, it seems that codefilterbranchcode is the way to go, but I get confused with examples and necessary housekeeping after its use.

Negative 1583 pIn Symfony 2s a hrefhttpsymfony.comdoc2.0booktranslation.html relnofollowdocumentation regarding translationsa all of the XLIFF examples appear to use codefile.extcode as the codeoriginalcode file attribute. From XLIFF 1.2s documentationp  blockquote   pemOriginal fileem  The original attribute specifies the name of the original file from which the contents of a  element has    been extracted.p blockquote  pIn Symfony 2s case I dont belief were actually extracting any contents for translation, but the codeoriginalcode attribute is required. The usage of codefile.extcode is never explained in Symfony 2s documentation, whether it is simply a place holder and ignored, or whether it needs to point to an actual file. My best guess is that it is ignored by Symfony 2, but I havent had a chance to do any tests or dig around in the code.p  pstrongSecond questionstrong Would it be appropriate to specify a default set of translations, e.g. codemessages.default.ymlcode and use this as the original file from which the XLIFF translations are derivedp  pXLIFF seems a little bit like overkill when it comes to translations for use with web applications...p

Negative 1583 pThere is a nice ASP.NET perf counter category and set of counters that can be used to track the request queue during perf test runs. However I cant find similar set for a WCF service strongnotstrong hosted thru IIS. Our WCF services are run as Windows services using nettcp protocols. Ive learned that there are a couple binding parameters that control queuing codeBinding.MaxConnectionscode and codeBinding.ListenBacklogcode. It wasnt a very easy find. So I wonder going forward, is there a why to track these two values in PerfMonp

Negative 1583 pI am trying to make a very simple game in Python 3.2.3 where I input a string character from a choice of options I have created and get a single result back.  After I get the results, it will will either loop back to the main menu function to make another choice or one option will end the program.p  pWhen I created this game, I was able to make a choice pop up when I typed it in but it always shows the first two options and not the one I input.p  pMy choice results are a mixture of addition operators and print text. I dont know if this helps but I will paste the code below.p  pCan anyone please tell me what Im doing wrong I think its my ifthenelse statement since no matter what I move around in that function it always shows the same output.  But any tips would be helpful.p  hr  h2Edith2  pIt may be best if I put in the entire code since I am now getting thep  blockquote   pNameError global name xString is not definedp blockquote  pAlso the setsword, setrock are all set as functions as well.

You have 6 options available in the main menu Attack with your sword, attack with magic, block with your shield, Throw a rock at it, Run away, and Quit fight or exit.  The calculations involve subtracting the attack damage numbers against the dragons HP or Health Points. For example, if your attack with sword number subtracts the dragons HP number and reaches 0 the dragon will be defeated and the game is won.  When the game is won the game is reset back to the main menu in this case the main menu are the fighting options.  I hope you find this particular project entry unique and fun  Main menu function.

Negative 1583 pIm using the WPF Toolkit for a .Net 4.0 application written in C. I have a Chart containing a Column Series bound to a dictionary.

And here comes the problem, with the initial value. Since the codeImportantValuecode is calculated asynchronously, the class cannot be fully initialized in constructor. It may be okay to have this value as null initially, but then I need to have some place where it will be calculated first time. A natural place for that could be the codeImportantValuecodes getter, but Im targeting to make it threadsafe and with no sideeffects.p  pSo Im basically stuck with these contradictions. Could you please help me and offer some alternative Having value initialized in constructor while nice is not really necessary, but no sideeffects and threadsafety of property is mandatory.p  pThanks in advance.p  pstrongEDITstrong One more thing to add. Im using Ninject for instantiation, and as far as I understand, it doesnt support async methods to create a binding. While approach with initiating some Taskbased operation in constructor will work, I cannot await its result. p  pI.e. two next approaches offered as answers so far will not compile, since Task is returned, not my objectp  precodeKernel.BindltIServiceProvidergt.ToMethodasync ctx gt await ServiceProvider.CreateAsync codepre  porp  precodeKernel.BindltIServiceProvidergt.ToMethodasync ctx gt       var sp  new ServiceProvider     await sp.InitializeAsync  codepre  pSimple binding will work, but Im not awaiting the result of asynchronous initialization started in constructor, as proposed by Stephen Clearyp  precodeKernel.BindltIServiceProvidergt.ToltServiceProvidergt codepre  p... and thats not looking good for me.p

Negative 1583 pstrongIntroductionstrongp  pIm refactoring pretty much rewriting a legacy application in my current internship. The part that this question will be concerned about is the database it uses and the way they retrieve data from it.p  pThe database structure isp  ol liTheres a table that has the main records. Lets say each record is a measurement. It has some info about the measured material and different measurement information.li liTheres a table view they use that has the same information columns, plus some extra columns that contains data calculated from the given measurements. And it also filters some of the data from the table.li ol  pSo lets say we have the main table with columnsp  precodeMeasurement ID Measurement A Measurement B codepre  pThe view has something like thisp  precodeMeasurement ID Measurement A Measurement B Some extra data for example Measurement A  Measurement B codepre  pThe guy that is leading the development only knows some SQL, so he likes adding new columns that is calculated by some columns in the main table for experimenting. And this is definitely a strongneedstrong at the moment.p  pstrongRequirements arestrongp  ol liDifferent types of databases should be supported like SQL Server, Oracle, and probably some others.li liThe frontend should be able to show the view, which means even though some main columns will always stay the same, there may be some new columns including newly calculated values.li ol  pstrongMy question isstrongp  pWhat kind of system should I use to accommodate the needs of this application I wanted to use Entity Framework, but the fact that the view may have new columns in the future is I think a problem. As far as I understand, I should map my classes to the database before compiling.p  pThe other thing that Im considering is maybe using Entity Framework to get data from the main table and do the calculations and the filtering that is currently done in the table view directly in the frontend, and skip the view altogether. Which sounds fine, though I dont know if they will allow me to do that.p  pWhat would you do in my case Please take into account that I have virtually no experience with databases and ORMs.p

Negative 1583 pI am trying to make an application which will prevent the screensaver coming on. This will have a time limit and will allow us to give users the option to prolong the screensaver during presentationsmovies without us having to change the policy to allow them to disable it all together.p  pFor this I have a C app which sends a keypress using codeSendKeys.Sendcode every 10 seconds. However this will only disable the screensaver after it comes on, and not before. In other words, when running this I observe the screensaver to come on and then turn off after 10 seconds, even though it has been running sending keypresses before, this does not prevent the screensaver from activating.p  pDoes anyone know what might cause this, or a way around I have tried Windows 7, Windows XP, Restricted account and Administrator account, all has the same result.p  pThanks in advancep

Negative 1583 pI have a dialog which lets the user choose a network share with the help of a custom action. I dont want the user to be able to continue the installation unless this location has been set. To achieve this aim, I disabled the PushButton Control that takes the user to the next dialog. My CustomAction sets a property which is checked for in the Condition element of that PushButton control.p  pThis all works well. What is bothering me is that I want the user to be able to navigate through the dialogs as easily as possible. Thats why I made the PushButton control, which takes the user to the browse dialog CustomAction, the Default control of the Dialog. This also is based on the condition of the property set by the CustomAction. After the property has been set, the PushButton taking the user to the next dialog is enabled and set as the default control. As you can see in the screenshots this actually works.p  pThe interesting thing is that the Default control of the Dialog has indeed been changed, but the tabbed control still remains the PushButton which opens the browse dialog CustomAction.

Negative 1583 pI come from the Java world and am a newbie to Rails. I have a developed a moderate sized Rails 3.2 business application. The time has come to develop a second application, as well as a portal application to allow users access to these and provide administrative user and role management.p  pSingle signon is a requirement log in once to the portal, then be able to access applications you have rights to and there are many fundamental domain models that need to be shared across the applications. Also, the applications use mostly the same gems and the same CSS.p  pAll applications will reside on the same server, and can share a database. There are two developers working on these apps, but only 1 app at a time i.e. no teams greater than 1 person.p  pThere seems to be three ways to architect this without going the route of exposing common data access as servicesp  ol lipA single mega app, with namespaced via modules and routes models, controllers and views. Single git repo.pli lipA single lightweight master rails app for the portal, containing shared models, views, controllers. Each business app is implemented as a mountable Rails engine. A git repo for the master app and each engine.pli lipA single full engine with shared models, views, controllers. Rails apps for the portal and each business app, which all reference the full engine. The engine could contain all models I guess, like a shared Java DAO library. A git repo for the full engine and each of the apps.pli ol  pThe Javalike approach would be 3, and this seems to be the most rational approach. From what Ive read, 2 is certainly possible, even though engines were intended to be used for common functionality that enhanced a master app e.g. a hrefhttpsgithub.complataformatecdevise relnofollowDevisea. Ive seen 1 being implemented before, but not 2 or 3 for a portal  multiple web app architecture. Converting our existing app to an engine is painful but possible.p  pThere are certain conveniences to having a single mega app and a single server deployment is simplified, for example. But it does mean that the apps are not in their own repos and any changes to the code requires redeploying the entire codebase. This seems to work for combining smaller apps into a single mega app, but I doubt it scales to larger business apps, even if they share a lot of models.p  pOther than the articles a hrefhttppivotallabs.commigratingfromasinglerailsapptoasuiteofrailsengines relnofollowMigrating from a single Rails app to a suite of Rails enginesa and a hrefhttpwww.slideshare.netAndyMalehrailsenginepatterns relnofollowRails Engine Patternsa, there seems to be little information available on this. Would appreciate some guidance from experienced Rails developersarchitects.p

Negative 1583 pLets say Ive got a simple script codeindex.phpcode which pulls in a remote page, collects data from it, does some formatting and saves a new page.

But that doesnt do the index.htmlindex.php conditions, only fulfills the if the file is old, serve a new one scenario.

Negative 1583 pHow would you chart something like pageviews over time using Highchartsp  pGiven that page views take place at sporadic irregular intervals, how could you chart this as accurately and legibly as possiblep  pOne way is to group pageviews into time intervals like days, and then sum up all pageviews on any given day.p  pThe obvious issue  here is that if you are only looking at data for a few days, the intervals are too large, and the data fits basically into a few buckets not really showing any trends.p  pAnother solution I thought of is to have a minimum interval say, 7 steps and when less than 7 days of data are requested, say 3 I could divide that time period into 7 intervals.p  pHowever this seems like too much fuss, especially on the backend, for the purpose of simply showing data.p  pGiven that the underlying data does not change, only the manner in which its rendered, I figured there must be a general solution to this problem.p

Negative 1583 pWe are building an app iOS and Android. The core of the app will be a flash card interface where the user will see a question and then will need to give an appropriate answer. They have a timer and will be shown hints as time goes on.p  pWe want to understand the following on a per question basis there are potentially 100s of questionsp  ul liWhich questions took longer to recall correctly with and without hintsli liWhich questions had the most errors with and without hintsli liWhich questions were skipped the most with and without hintsli liWhat were the most common wrong answers for a questionli ul  pOf course, we are also going to be collecting number of installs, usage, churn, etc., but I figure that is pretty well covered by GA. p  pAlso, we will be storing different information about the user themselves so they can track their progress.

Negative 1583 pAs many people knew, HTML5 Canvas codelineTocode is going to give you a very jaggy line at each corner. At this point, a more preferable solution would be to implement codequadraticCurveTocode, which is a very great way to generate smooth drawing. However, I desire to create a smooth, yet accurate, draw on canvas HTML5. Quadratic curve approach works well in smoothing out the draw, but it does not go through all the sample points. In other word, when I try to draw a quick curve using quadratic curve, sometime the curve appears to be corrected by the application. Instead of following my drawing path, some of the segment is curved out of its original path to follow a quadratic curve. p  pMy application is intended for a professional drawing on HTML5 canvas, so it is very crucial for the drawing to be both smooth and precise. I am not sure if I am asking for the impossible by trying to put HTML5 canvas on the same level as photoshop or any other painter applications SAI, painterX, etc.p  pThanksp

Negative 1583 p[Reframing prior question, which had been posed as a question about Cursors.]p  pI am looking for a way to select counts under certain date conditions.p  pSay there is a table, codeT1code, with 2 fields codeIDcode, codeDatecode. The codeIDcode is not a unique key. The table records events by id, and some ids occur frequently, some infrequently. p  pFor examplep  precodeID    Date 1     20100101 2     20100201 3     20100215 2     20100215 4     20100301 codepre  pI would like to create a new table with the following fields ID, Date, Count of times ID appears in 6 months previous to Date, Count of times ID appears in 6 months after Date.  p  pIn essence, for every row in the existing table, I want to add a column that looks back for times the same ID has appeared in previous six months, and look ahead for times the same ID has appeared in following six months.p  pSo the output for the example would hopefully look something likep  precodeID    Date         Lookback    Lookahead 1     20100101   0           0 2     20100201   0           1 3     20100215   0           0 2     20100215   1           0 4     20100301   0           0 codepre  pIs there a best way to formulate the appropriate queryp
Negative 1583 pA lot of folks on Stack Overflow are probably trying to fix forms that dont submit, but Im actually hoping to do the oppositep  pWhat Id like to do for an art project is make a form with a joke field  say, your SSN, your bank account number, your fingerprints or retina scans or DNA code, or something super personal like that. But I emdontem want the number in our server logs, and I emdontem want it to be transmitted over the internet at all. I dont want any legal liabilityp  pBasically the idea is just to ask for something audacious, but emnotem to handle the data that may or may not come from users who actually put it in.p  pSo, is there a way to make a field that acts as a normal form field, but where nonetheless we would feel safe that users who actually do put their sensitive info in the field will be protectedp  pWhats the safest approach to something like thisp

Negative 1583 pI am trying to run Jetty 9 on Ubuntu 12.10 32 bit. The JVM i am using in JDK 1.7.040. I have setup a rest service on my server that uses RestLib.

I have a Intel i5 processor box with 8 GB memory. I have setup a Jmeter to test this rest in the localhost setting. I know this is not advisable but i would like to know this number just out of curiosity.p  pWhen I run the JMeter to test this POST method with 1 MB of payload data in the body, i am getting a through put of around 20 for 100 users. p  pI measured the the bandwidth using iperf to begin withp  precodeiperf c 127.0.0.1 p 8080   Client connecting to 127.0.0.1, TCP port 8080  TCP window size  167 KByte default  [  3] local 127.0.0.1 port 44130 connected with 127.0.0.1 port 8080  [ ID] Interval       Transfer     Bandwidth  [  3]  0.010.0 sec   196 MBytes   165 Mbitssec codepre  pthe number 165 MB seems ridiculously small for me but thats one observation. p  pI ran the server with StatisticsHandler enabled and was observing the request mean time. Also was observing the system resources using nmon monitoring tool.p  pThe CPU usage was around 20  overall, 4GB of free memory and the number of threads in the server monitored using jconsole around 200 i had specified max thread count as 2000 in start.ini file.p  pJmeter was configured to bombard repeatedly.p  pI observed the network usage in local loopback interface in nmon tool and it was around  30 MB.

Negative 1583 pI am working on a JAXRS web service and I need to put in place both authentication and authorization.  The authorization part is easy, but Im trying to get my head around how to authenticate.  Mind you, I know what authentication is, but I am looking for an implementation, or to create my own.  I have read about Spring security, but a lot of those solutions involve XML config, and Im going for Zero XML configuration.  I know its a tall order.  But so far so good, up until authentication.  Here is my Jetty starterp  precodepackage com.example.app.web  import com.example.app.context.Config import org.apache.cxf.transport.servlet.CXFServlet import org.eclipse.jetty.server.Server import org.eclipse.jetty.servlet.ServletContextHandler import org.eclipse.jetty.servlet.ServletHolder import org.springframework.web.context.ContextLoaderListener import org.springframework.web.context.support.AnnotationConfigWebApplicationContext  public class JettyStarter       public static void main final String[] args  throws Exception          Server server  new Server8080         final ServletHolder servletHolder  new ServletHoldernew CXFServlet         final ServletContextHandler context  new ServletContextHandler         context.setContextPath         context.addServletservletHolder, app         context.addEventListenernew ContextLoaderListener         context.setInitParametercontextClass, AnnotationConfigWebApplicationContext.class.getName         context.setInitParametercontextConfigLocation, Config.class.getName         server.setHandlercontext         server.start         server.join       codepre  pMy Config class is similarly XML freep  precodeConfiguration ComponentScancom.example.app public class Config        BeandestroyMethod  shutdown     public SpringBus cxf          return new SpringBus           Bean     public JaxRsApiApplication jaxRsApiApplication          return new JaxRsApiApplication        etc...   codepre  pNow I want to hook into some kind of authentication phase, and I dont mind rolling my own authentication if it means not programming in XML.  But how do I inform Spring that I want to check on authentication before the api routes gets hit Does this question make sensep  pAs an added complexity, routes like a health check do not need authentication, whereas routes that do real things, eg create accounts, update user info, etc, do need authentication.  In the perfect scenario I have nginx sitting in front of my Java application server Jetty, and reverse proxy as needed.

Negative 1583 pI am working on a very large ASP.NET project that includes multiple different languages including C, jquery, Javascript, Ajax, SQL etc.p  pThe project works with Diallers, so a number is entered and a headset used to communicate with the client on the other side.  We have recently received complaints from one of our clients regarding climbing memory usage and that they can only dial about 25 times before the memory gets so high and the system becomes so slow and unresponsive that they have to log out, close the program and then log in again.  We have a WebBrowser Class that handles our application.  p  pTrying to find the memory leak, I tested on 2 different machines with radically different specsp  pstrongPC 1strongp  pCPU Pentium 4 2 Ghz p  pRAM 512 Mbp  pOS Windows XP SP3p  pstrongPC 2strongp  pCPU Intel Core i7 3770p  pRAM 8GBp  pOS Windows 7 SP 1p  pNow here is what bugs me and melts my brain.  Our client runs both XP and Windows 7 machines.  On both, the same problem occurs.  So that is Internet Explorer 8 and Internet Explorer 9 respectively.  On our side, when testing it out at the office, it only happens on the XP machine.  The memory climbs until it is above 302 MB512MB and then it resets and goes down again.  When the machine and application is idle, the memory stays consistent and doesnt climb, however when I use the application, the memory climbs making me think its not browser related.  The Windows 7 machine, I cant get the memory above 100 MB no matter what I do.  When I leave the application idle, the memory stays consistent.  The strange thing is, this is only reported at one of our many clients.  None of our other clients have this issue.  Making me think it might be something in their environment.p  pOur application makes use of Ajax and a lot of functionality in jquery.  I have started ruling out Internet Explorer, since it happens on 8 and 9 by the clients.  I am now leaning towards jqueryAjax.p  pI have spent days on this now, and I just cant figure out how to go about fixing this problem.  It seems like finding a needle in a haystack.  It can literally be anything, I have even read about Antivirus or other apps causing problems.  p  pI have read the following articles, but there is no clear answer here  p  pa hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions7715666possiblememoryleaksininternetexplorer7backbonePossible memory leaks in Internet Explorer 7Backbonea p  pa hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions9546289internetexplorer8memoryconsumptionInternet explorer 8 memory consumptionap  pa hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions5888711javascriptmemoryleakininternetexplorerJavascript memory leak in Internet Explorerap  pIf Ive missed anything, I apologise.

Negative 1583 pI was surprised to find that there is pretty much no mention of this anywhere.p  pHeres the problem  I have a tutorials app and majority of the 1 stars I get are due to complains that my app is not in their local language. Since I cant possibly learn a dozen languages, Ive decided the least I can do is use google translate and make more resources.p  pSince the translation wont be perfect, I want to give the users the option to switch back to the default english version.p  pHow I expect to go about doing this p  pSay I have the following foldersp  pvalues, value fr, valuesja, valuesspp  pI want to simply put a spinned in my settings activity and let the user choose the language. So, Ill probably get a SharedPref variable, store it permanently and make it easily changeable via settings. p  pSay I store a int value as sharedpref. If its example 0, I want use english strings.... If its 1, I want to use french and so on.p  pSo, how can I pragmatically change the values folder. I know that by default, andorid WILL select fr, ja, en depending on the locale set on first device startup. But I want the users to have an option to go back to default since again translation might be imperfect.p

Negative 1583 pI am working on an application with train schedules, where the first train leaves at 0400 while the last train leaves at 0200. The users of this application therefore deal with days starting at 0300 and ending at 0300. In other words, when they say The Wednesdaytrain at 0200 they really mean The train that leaves on Thursday at 0200. p  pOur application needs to store all of the trains leaving on for example Wednesday, which means it should not include the trains that leave before 0300 but it should include the trains that leave the next day until 0300. p  pHow would I represent this in application without going mad And how should this be stored in a database for easy queryingp

Negative 1583 pI am trying to make a small appointment timetable for 5 people for daily use. The only problem I am having now is to get the timetable display all appointment for the same staff into one column. I have tried a few different way but no luck so far. I will post the best two attempt I got.p  pBelow is the example output I got from the code I wrote for the first attempted.p  pa hrefhttpjsfiddle.netyy885CXcjR2 relnofollowhttpjsfiddle.netyy885CXcjR2ap  pIt display the appointment separately as the query for this output is just normal query for that staff on a specified date. My problem is I cannot find a way to combine these 3 records and output it into one column in this timetable. As for now, if I have 5 appointments for each of them then this will display 25 records 25 columns which is not going to work well. Based on the code I have so far, I can think of a quick way to work around but I prefer not to use it. That will be showing only ONE staff at a time. But this way is difficult for the girl who is going to mark the appointment as she may overlook the timetable and give out wrongly datetime to the customer.p  precodeltphp  includeconnect.phpconnect to the database. todaydate  datemdY todaydate  11222013 staffd  Jerry query  mysqlquerySELECT  FROM appointment2 where date.todaydate.

Negative 1583 pI have an application where it shows UICollectionViewController v1 on launching. If I double tap on a cell, a seque S is performed and another view controller v2 is opened. When the back is tapped in v2, it comes back to collection view, v1. This all works fine. p  pNow I have a requirement to open the app from thirdPartyApp like from Mail. If I open a file from Mail, it should directly open the v2. I am now performing the seque S in the app delegate, it is showing v1 and then v2. Is there any way to show the v2 directly from Mail, and show v1 on hitting back button p  pThanksp

Negative 1583 pIn my application, I am passing an Arraylist from one activity to another. FlipCardActivity is the parent activity Activity A and RecipientsActivity is the child Activity Activity B. I pass an empty RecipientArray ArrayList from A to B using putExtra. In activity B, I check whether ArrayLists size is zero and if it is zero, another activity Activity C is called which then adds items to the arraylist and returns it to Activity B. In B, I use ListView to show the items. I have a Back button in activity B which finishes B and restarts activity A. Again when I click on an EditText activity B is started. Now I still have items in the ArrayList but when I set the adapter to the ListView to show the items it gives a NullPointerException.

Negative 1583 pI have build an MFC project executable as dll or more accurately I have added export functions to its just like a dll. I can load and execute the exported functions however the problem is that when I load the dll, the main application class codeCMyApp theAppcodedoesnt get instantiated.

I have even modified the function below so it matches that of a standard MFC dll.p  precodeBOOL CMyAppInitInstance     CWinAppInitInstance     return TRUE  codepre  pI am using codeLoadLibrarycode to load the exedll. Note, I am not exporting any c class from dll, just few standard C style functions.

I believe this is same behavior even if it was a dll. My projects has many dependencies and creating a new dll project and adding all files and libraries is too cumbersome. I would really like to change the project settings of the current project if any so I can have it loaded with the application class properly instantiated just like a regular MFC dll.

Negative 1583 pI have a modal view controller presented and just before I dismiss it, I need to call a delegate method which tells the parent view controller to update. As methods like codeviewWillAppearcode are not called when dismissing a modal view controller.p  pSo my code looks like thisp  precode[delegate addEquipmentDidSaveYES] [self dismissViewControllerAnimatedYES completionnil] codepre  pVery simple. Send a message back, saying, update now And then just dismiss the view. However, while both of these lines are called, the delegate method never runs. So I check that the delegate it set correctly. When I present the modal view I set the delegate, so its all connected.p  pIts as if the delegate method isnt getting a chance to run before the view is dismissed. Is this possible What do you think might be the issuep  pThanks.p

Negative 1583 pIm a beginner to javascript, but want to be able to dynamically create an image element with an onload function with pure javascript, not with jquery.p  pI need this for preloading.

Negative 1583 pI have an API server built by Python flask. And I need a group of clientscomputers to send data over to the API server by making http post request. p  pThe data here is actually html content.  NOTE I am not turning legit data into HTMLXML format, the data its self is HTML that I have collected form the web which is usually about 200KB per page. And I am trying to alleviate the network load as much as I can by using serialdeserial and compression. p  pI am thinking about instead of send raw HTML across the network. Is there any kind of method like Serialize the html object BeautifulSoup soup and deserialize on the server side. Or use some compression method to zip the file first and then post the data to the API server. On the server side, it can decompress the data once it receive the compressed one.  p  pWhat I have done p  p1 I tried to turn the raw HTML text into a soup object, and then use Pickle to serialize that. However, it told me too many recursions and errorred out. I also tried pickle the raw html and the compression performance is bad... almost the same size as the raw html string. p  p2 I tried zlib to compress the file beforehand and then it is 10 the size of its original one. However, is this the legit way to approach this problemp  pAny thoughtsp

Negative 1583 pstrongContextstrong Im running a job consisting of 1 to 50 tasks on a cluster, waiting for it to finish, and then pulling the results usingp  precodeoutputArgs  getAllOutputArguementsmyJob codepre  pstrongThe Problemstrong The getAllOutputArguements function is returning a gigantic cell array, the size of which can vary from [1x1] cells to [1x50] cells. Each cell of outputArgs contains another array of cells, which can range from [1x1] to [1x15], and in each of those cells is an array of doubles which can vary from [1x106] elements to [500x106] elements. These ranges have the potential to get larger in the future. This generates an Out of Memory  error, because the size of outputArgs exceeds the allocated memory for MATLAB.p  pstrongThe Questionstrong What I need to do is save each toplevel cell as a file. However, as far as I can tell, getAllOutputArguements is an atomicindivisible operation for MATLAB. Does anyone know a way to assign each cell to a file, without first placing the output of getAllOutputArguements into a variablep  pstrongCaveatstrong I know that this problem could be solved by increasing my data limit, but the application I am building is going to be distributed, and I need a more elegant, less hardwaredependent solution.p

Negative 1583 pI am trying to write a program in C to read, manipulate, and update my database.  I am having a problem inserting my data into mongo.  So for my work flow, I get some type of request to update a document.  I query the document, and update the data.  I then try to do an update on the document.  p  pI have a function that converts my class object to a BSONObj through a BSONObjBuilder.  I seem to be having a problem with large arrays of subobjects. For example, I have a field in my document called geo that looks like thisp  pcodegeo [postal 10012,postal10013,...,postal90210]codep  pand is stored in C asp  pcodestdvectorltmongoBSONObjgt geocodep  pthis field might have thousands of postal codes in it. When doing p  pcodedb.getgtupdatedb.collection,BSONidltltid, BSONsetltltupdateObjcodep  pwhere updateObj is the obj I got from my BSONObjBuilder, nothing is updated in mongo. If I remove the geo field, everything is inserted. p  pI tried to just dop  precodedb.getgtupdatedb.collection,BSONidltltid, BSONsetltltBSONgeo ltlt geo codepre  pthinking maybe it necessary to do separate queries due to the size of the obj and this also result in no update.p  pI was wondering if somehow I was hitting some sort of BSON size limit in C.  p  pThe only reason I believe it is a size limit is because while trying to debug this problem, I tried to call updateObj.toString in order to print out the object I was trying to insert and it threw an exception codeElement extends past end of objectcode.  I assume that this means I hit some type of max size of an objectelement.  p  pAny insight into this problem will be greatly appreciated.p  pThank youp

Negative 1583 pI have a line chart component written using D3 and Angular. It has draggable bars used to change the scale of x axis. Now I am trying to test the component using KarmaJasmine.

Here is the code I use to trigger dragging such code fires a correct d3 drag event on a test html page, but fails inside a unit test. p  precode    var leftBar  element.find.leftbar[0]     var evObjStart  document.createEventMouseEvents     evObjStart.initMouseEventmousedown, true, true, window, 1, 12, 320, 12, 320, false, false, false, false, 0, null     var evObj  document.createEventMouseEvents     evObj.initMouseEventmousemove, true, true, window, 1, 100, 320, 100, 320, false, false, false, false, 0, null     var evObjEnd  document.createEventMouseEvents     evObjEnd.initMouseEventmouseup, true, true, window, 1, 200, 320, 200, 320, false, false, false, false, 0, null      leftBar.dispatchEventevObjStart     leftBar.dispatchEventevObj     leftBar.dispatchEventevObjEnd codepre  pI found out that only the first event is correctly dispatched leftBar.dispatchEventevObjStart. Other two events are not dispatched at all. leftBar variable is correct 100. I am totally lost on where to search the error.  br P.S. I tried generating dragstart, drag and dragend events, but they are not handled properly by d3 in browser did not work in a basic test example in console. Mousedownmousemovemouseup sequence works correctly in browser, but only mousedown is dispatched in the unit test. Will be very grateful for any help or ideas. p
Negative 1583 pI need to get inputs from multiple codeCCTVcode cameras and take it to the PC. Once it is in PC, I need to run a codeOpenCVcode program on the video input provided by each individual camera and perform some image recognition work. Everything should happen on real time.

Negative 1583 pIs it possible to strongconsistentlystrong refer to the factory object from within an Angularjs factory For example, I have an factory codeAlertscode that is made up of an array of alerts, a codecreatecode method amp a codedismisscode method. codeAlerts.createcode pushes an alert in the codeAlerts.alertscode array amp takes an optional parameter that autodismisses the array after 5 seconds.

Negative 1583 pIve recently noticed a significant performance issue with my app. I essentially have the following layout... img srchttpi.stack.imgur.comAumKQ.png altenter image description herep  pstrongDESCRIPTIONstrong brIn short, there is a codeViewPagercode that holds 3 codeRelativeLayoutcodes as pages. Inside each page there a number of codeTextViewcodes. I recently noticed a lot of lag when I type into the codeEditTextcode that has a codeTextWatchercode on it to perform a quick SQL query for autocompleting. My HTC One M8 stutters and lags as I input text, but I know it isnt the querying that is slow because I measured queries taking only about 7 ms.p  pI used method profiling, Systrace, and plain old codeLogcode debugging and concluded that each time I typed a character in the codeEditTextcode about strong1,700strong calls to codeonMeasurecode were being made on the codeTextViewcodes within codeRelativeLayoutcode A, B, and C. Cumulatively, there are only about 15 independent codeTextViewcodes across the pages. I noticed that strongeach codeonMeasurecode is being called hundreds of times instead of just once or twicestrong like it usually might.p  pstrongQUESTIONstrong brI dont know why typing in the codeEditTextcode in page B would cause other codeTextViewcodes in pages A and C to also get remeasured. More importantly, does anyone have insights on why codeonMeasurecode is being called so often And, does anyone know of a solution to significantly reduce the number of calls to codeonMeasurecodep  pstrongDETAILSstrong brThis may help I was actually able to cut the the number of codeonMeasurecode calls to about 900, by removing codeRelativeLayoutcode 2 which could suggest the propagation of codeonMeasurecode calls starts outside of the codeViewPagercode.p

The corruption    occurs as follows     1. The 512byte header block for each file is preceded by an extra       four bytes 00 00 02 00. Note that the 3rd byte 02 is       trivially twice the number of blocks taken up by the header     2. The data is divided into groups of 64 512byte blocks with the       final group being as many blocks as needed to fill out the       data.  Before each group, 4 bytes are inserted of form 00 00       xy 00 where the hex pair xy is equal to twice the number of       512byte blocks in the group. So, if the group is a full 64       blocks, then 00 00 80 00 is inserted. Similarly, if there       only Z blocks in the group then xy is equal to 2z in hex.     Note Summing the third bytes of all the skips equals two times    the total number of blocks in the tar file headers  data.     Note The file ends with a 17byte string starting with 78 da    which happens to be the magic number used by adb backup for zlib    deflate.  When this 17byte string is inflated, it yields a    1024byte file filled with nulls 00. This 17byte string is    obviously meaningless and is discarded.      AUTHOR    Jeffrey J.

Negative 1583 pIve been trying to achieve synchronization between two  ListViews but I cant seem to be able to make it work smoothly.p  pThe idea is that  the listviews are aligned next to each other inside a LinearLayout. The rows of each listview can be very complex  i.e. they may include several TextViews, CheckBoxes, Spinners or Buttons. The data sets used for each ListView are obviously different, therefore the rows in the left listview can have different height compared to the rows  in the right listview. What I want to do is make them have the same row height at the same position.p  pI managed to do that using the same adapter for both lists and introducing a mediator pattern. What it does now is before getView returns the view i call a method in my mediatator whcih  pretty much does the followingp  prow number 3 in LV1 needs to be drawn. android draws it and determines that it needs to be 40 pixels high. right before its returned i call my mediator which checks the height of the same row  i keep a reference of the two adapter instances in the mediator position in the second listview and returns  that its 70 pixels. i set the height of row number 3 in LV1 to 70 and redraw it.p  pThe problem is that whenever it needs to draw a new row it does a lot of work and theres an insane amount of calls to getView Also, when i change the height of a row in one of the list views so it matches the other, i force a complete redraw of all visible children in that listview which adds even more lag.p  pMy question is   is my concept totally wrong Am i missing something here Is there an easier way to do what i want top  precode                LV 1                     LV 2                           1                        1                                2                        2                              3                        3                             4                        4                             5                        5            codepre

In my case this really hurts as I like to display something with the same properties as a cursor. Imagine that a cursor suddenly is hidden if you open a menu  unacceptable.p  p3 I like to read the pixels from the Windows desktop, including any effect Windows applies like blur, and use this information for my filter. If I add my overlay, as described in 2, I should be able to get a fresh unobstructed copy of the background in the next frame and not read out my own overlay.p  p4 If I just write something into the Windows desktop directly, it gets overwritten immediately on the next frame by Windows itself. This is not acceptable.p  pOne example of such an application is a magnifying glass, which exactly has all the properties I need. But for this case Windows 8.1 has an API. In contrast I like to write a program which displays a hand on the desktop which is controlled by Leap Motion which influences the Windows desktop, so you almost feel how you move your hand over the desktop.p  pIf I write a tiny DirectX andor OpenGL application for myself this is all very easyp  ul lirender all the regular stuff to a textureli liuse this texture for a post processing filter and add all my stuff on top of itli lirender just a quad to the back bufferli ul  pBut I like to do that for the whole Windows desktop.p  pI found many different application, but they are to no use for mep  ul liapplication which claim to be on top, are still behind menus.

Negative 1583 pIn Odoo 8 you can create an email alias for a project which will create a task for that project for all incoming emails.  This works great until you enable etherpad.  Once etherpad is enabled the task name comes through from the email subject but the description of the task is left blank.  How do you make it so the new task created also creates an etherpad related to that task  It seems like it should be out of the box functionality that I dont have configured properly, but I cannot find it.  If anyone has other ways module that would accomplish this that is also an acceptable solution.p

I am working on app that is being supported from iOS6.0 if I change the data types that are of 64bit, will it work fine in 32bit devices Because, changing the data types to 64bit will create compiler warnings for 32bit..

Negative 1583 pIm creating a simple UDP client and server in java. However,I keep getting a java.util.NoSuchElementException when I try to get the user to enter a second choice.p  pThe first choice works great though. User enters number, packet gets sent to server, then back to the client. However when the loop comes back around to prompt the user for another choice, thats when the error occurs. p  pIve tried multiple different things, such as adding the scanner instantiation within the while loop, tried to clear the scan buffers by adding keyScan.nextLine at the end of the while loop, changing nextInt to nextLine and parsing the line as an integer, all to no avail.

Negative 1583 pI need to get my fit data to reflect that which shows in the android fit application.

Both of these values do not reflect the values of the fit API.p  pI have come up with the idea of storing the previous day value in the sharedPref and subtracting the difference to get the true value. Other calculations for when the device resets need to be factored in as well.p  pIs there any easier way of getting the values I needp

Negative 1583 pIm currently using the maven surefire plugin to run tests against my java source code. However, I ran into an issue and was hoping to get some advice on how to solve it. I currently have 3 build profiles local, int, prod, each with a different set of database parameters urlusernamepassword. The issue is when Im building my code,  the unit tests are running against the database configured to each build profile, and Id like to have the unit tests only run against the local database regardless of which build profile I choose.

Negative 1583 pI am using a generic BLE plugin for PhoneGap when developing a BLE enabled application.

Does anybody of you know, how to read for example the battery status from SticknFind BLE beacons. So far I have been able to discover,  that its necessary to connect to the beacon and after it a characteristic has to be read. But here, I am lost.p  pMarekp

Negative 1583 pThis is my first question on here so I apologize if I have broken some rule in making and asking this. I am new to java as wellalmost finished in a computer science class for java.  If I have done something wrong, just let me know and Ill fix it.p  pI am trying to work on lighting for a basic java 2d game. I am hoping to not have to use and extra libraries beyond what java provides.br I have figured out how to add by painting everything to a graphics g layer and then using clip to mark out rectangles around a lightsource and then fill in everything except these marked light regions.  I am then filling in these rectangles with a radialgradient paint.  It works fairly well, except for when two light sources are near each other.  The radialgradient overlaps and causes a weird effect where the edges just get darker.  So it will look like two light sources but the overlap, instead of becoming lighter, gets twice as dark. i need more rep to post pictures, but i feel like my description was worthless, so here is a hrefhttpi.imgur.comfTbxNQX.png relnofollowa link to imgura of my example picture the green rectangle was just a player object that I can move around, and the background is currently a fish tankp  phere is my basic coding for lightingp  precode    public void renderGraphics2D g2      GameObject tempObject     Rectangle clipRect     Area out     forint i  0 i lt handler.object.size i         tempObject  handler.object.geti         iftempObject.getId  ID.Light             clipRect  tempObject.getBounds             out  new Areanew Rectangle0,0,Game.WIDTH, Game.HEIGHT             out.subtractnew AreaclipRect             g2.clipout                    g2.setColornew Color0,0,0, 255     g2.fillRect0,0,Game.WIDTH,Game.HEIGHT      g2.setClip0, 0, Game.WIDTH, Game.HEIGHT   codepre  pDoes anyone know how I could fix this radialgradient overlap issue Or is there a more efficient route than using radial gradient for lightingp

Negative 1583 pOften I have to program microcontrollers in C, because C compilers are often not available, or can not make extremely small code because of various bugs.  But often, OOP syntactic sugar, is very convenient when it comes to making programs for hardware more clearly encapsulated for easy maintenance so I wanted to find out if there was a way to do OOP syntax in C where as much as possible the OOP overhead when not needed could be made to optimize out in a way that is portable. eg That will optimize with gcc targeted for different microcontrollers, or perhaps by using gccs preprocessor and a generic ANSIC compiler if gcc is not available for that microcontroller.p  pI found only threads, like this, a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions10266559elegantwaytoemulatethispointerwhendoingoopincElegant way to emulate 39this39 pointer when doing OOP in Ca which generally do OOP by embedding pointers into structs but thats not always what I want because it wastes memory when Im not interested in virtual methods, or anything like that.  I can always follow the coding style in the link where those features are needed, but I want to develop techniques for when they are not needed e.g. I just want to be able to program using OOP paradigms, with simple easy to understand code Not necessarily C, though I like C, and still be able to achieve a minimal C program memory usage when some OOP paradigms are not in use.p  pSo, I resorted to experimentation with gcc, and C99, because in general gcc 3.2 or above is available for most platforms and realized that I could use the sizeof and typeof compiler functions from C99 to index classes automatically  a trick of sorts  from an unuseduninitialized union member So classes must be unions with substructs, in order to access a compile time constant lookup table created by macros, which could bind data and methods, and guarantee all type checking. etc. etc. etc.p  peg GCC allows the optimizing out of const structures, and arrays, when their members are only accessed as constant expressions, so I thought I might be able to use that to build a macro based compile time binding system where the OOP overhead is handled in GCC and actually optimizes out of the final binary.p  pWith this system, I can now do variadic macro method calls, like  M a , init, with, any, parameters, 7  which looks up variable as type, call method init, using variable number of parameters... p  pSee code examples below, and try them out  its simpler than the explanation  Use gcc E to see the macro expansions, and note for ANSI only compilers, the typeof operator will have to be replaced by a voidtypecast type checking only works with GCC.p  pThe code is cut and pasteable into a text editor, with filename on first line, and it does compile and run on normal PC systems.p  pAlthough I did succeed in getting rid of individual pointers in every struct to point back to a classs list of methods, which saves memory in a limited memory microcontroller, I wasnt quite able to figure out how to get the compiler to optimize out emunusedem method pointers because I had to use void pointers for the classes to hold them in an array, and those require a memory address address of a struct and a linker instance and dont optimize out.p  pSo I was wondering if anyone knew of a way to improve my solution by making some kind of an eminitializedem method struct which would optimize out have no linker address after compilation, eg when its members are only accessed as constant expressions in the code.   In essence Im needing to be able to look up an element in array where the initialized portion of each array element is a different classXXXmt, rather than a list of addresses to classXXXmt all typecast to void.p  pTheres two other improvements Id like help with if anyone can think of a simple solution  The cpp cpreprocessor doesnt allow defining of new macros from within a previous macro by token concatenation As far as I know, so I have to make fixed length macro lists A maximum of 10 in my example to hold class definitions which means I can only have a maximum of 10 classes in a program but ideally, I would like a way to make my code more generic, so that the cpp could create variable length lists on the fly.  eg The problem is related the inability of the c preprocessor to count automatically.p  pAnd secondly, when I try to use anonymous structs for newer versions of GCC, so I might get rid of an extra m required to access member data in ISOC eg foo.m.mydata, by deleting the m name from the class union definition, and compile with gcc stdc11  , it then simply gave me errors claiming the struct defined nothing... so, anonymous structs inside unions dont work even in GCC 4.8 although it supposed to  how can I get anonymous structs to workp  pBelow is the example of how I tested and implemented an include file, voidbind.h, which builds a list of classes and statically links the methods to the variables of that class type.p  pUltimately, the system allows me to program like this example which I compiled with gcc 4.0 to 4.9 with no problemsp  precodeclasstest.c ifndef MACROCHECK   Dont macro expand stdio.h, its ugly... include ltstdio.hgt   to see macros, do gcc D MACROCHECK E classtest.c endif include class1.h  include example class, library.  define VOIDFINALIZE include voidbind.h  Make class list finalized, no more classes allowed  void main void       class1ct a  types ending in ct are the macro created class types     class2ct b      M a , init   Call method of variable, a, and the function init.     printfas sn,a.m.name, M b, tryme, echo is this         Id love to be rid of .m. in the previous line using anonymous struct  codepre  pNext is the Class definition  header file, for both class1 and class2, showing how the macro preprocessor is used to create classes of data bound to methods and the ct type normally this would probably be broken up into two header files, and two libraries but Im just abusing the header by putting all the code together for simplicity.p  precodeclass1.h ifndef class1h define class1h    Define the data type structure for class1 typedef struct      char name     int   one  class1t   Define the method type structure for class1  union class1ctt   class type tag, incomplete tag type for class1ct typedef struct   method prototypes     void init union class1ctt   passed a pointer to class1ct  class1mt   bind class1mt and class1t together into class1ct define VOIDNEWCLASS class1 include voidbind.h   Begin class2 definition typedef struct   define data type for class2     int x  class2t  union class2ctt   class type tag, forward definition typedef struct   method prototypes for class2     char tryme union class2ctt, char echo   class2mt   bind class2t and class2mt together into class2ct define VOIDNEWCLASS class2 include voidbind.h    Start library code  This would normally be a separate file, and linked in  but as were doing a test, this is in the header instead...  include ltclass1.hgt  void class1init class1ct self       selfgtm.name  test     selfgtm.one5      Define class1s method type mt instance of linker data ld  voidbind.h when it creates classes, expects an instance of the  method type mt named with mtld appended to link the prototyped  methods to C functions.  This is the actual binding information  and is the data that I cant get to optimize out, eg when there  is more than one method, and some of them are not used by the program  class1mt class1mtld       .initclass1init     CLASS2 libcode   char class2tryme class2ct self, char echo       return echo    class2s method type mt instance of linker data ld. class2mt class2mtld    linker information for method addresses     .trymeclass2tryme     End of library code  endif codepre  pFinally, comes voidbind.h This is the heart of the system, Getting the CPP to make a compile time constant list of void pointers to method structs ... the void list will always optimize out, as long as everything passed in are compile time constants. But the structs in the list will not completely optimize out.  even if constants. p  pFor this to idea to work, I had to figure out a way to make cpp count how many times the voidbind header file was included, in order to automatically make a list of class pointers, and since the macro preprocessor can not do addition, or define macros which change based on a previous definition of the same macro name I had to use inline functions to save the pointer to the class method struct mt from one pass to the next.  Thats what forces me to basically use void pointers, though it might be solvable in another way.p  precode voidbind.h  A way to build compile time void pointer arrays  These arrays are lists of constants that are only important at compile  time and which go away once the compilation is finished egstatic bind.  Example code written by Andrew F. Robinson of Scappoose   ifdef VOIDWASFINALIZED  error voidbindh was included twice after a VOIDFINALIZE was defined endif    VOIDFINALIZE, define only after all class headers have been included.   It will simplify the macro expansion output, and minimize the memory impact  of an optimization failure or disabling of the optimization in a bad compiler  in hopes of making the program still work.  ifdef VOIDFINALIZE  define VOIDWASFINALIZED undef VOIDBIND static inline void VOIDBIND int x       return VOIDBINDOBJ[ x ]  else   Make sure this file has data predefined for binding before being  included, or else error out so the user knows its missing a define.  if  defined VOIDNEWOBJ  ampamp  defined VOIDNEWCLASS   error missing a define of VOIDNEWOBJ or VOIDNEWCLASS endif     Initialize a macro once to count the number of times this file  has been included eg since one object is to be added to the void  list each time this file is included.

Negative 1583 pIve got a JavaRestlet application that runs two servers. One at a specified port henceforth the UI server, and one at a port randomly chosen at runtime henceforth the file server, both at the same host.p  pAssume that this application is run locally, and when it is secured it is done with a selfsigned certificate. The file server has CORS headers, and the UI server makes HTTP Get requests to it through jQuery AJAX.p  pIf the application is secured with SSL, I secure both servers with the same keystore and password. However, at this point I can no longer make jQuery AJAX Get requests to the file server from the UI server. The reason is that, although the user has told their browser to make an exception for the self signed certificate in the UI server, they havent and indeed cant have done so for the file server, since it has a random port. So the requests do not go through to the file server.p  pBasically I understand that modern browsers are going to prevent me from making an AJAX request to a server with an invalid SSL certificate, but I am creating both servers, and theyre using the same certificate, and I just need to convince the browser to let me make this requestp

When a method is called, however, CGLib seems to replace all the beans with Spring enhanced versions, hence overwriting the Mockito version.p  pWhat is the correct way to use both Mockito and Spring in an integration test for a class with codeTransactionalcode annotationsp
Negative 1583 pSo Im having a little trouble understanding how multiple segue between multiple view controllers specifically multiple table views on a general level. Even after looking at responses and trying to search for examples of table views connecting to different table views, I still couldnt find a solid explanation and was wondering if someone could clarify for me. Im not entirely sure of the whole logic and vertability of what is legal or illegal, so please take my two scenarios with a grain of salt and let me know if I got some assumptions wrongp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comXtDby.jpg altTableViewExamplep  pI have two potential scenarios trying to achieve different table view cells for each row in the Table View Controller  examples of different cells is highlighted in the box in blue on the right. p  pThe first scenario, I was thinking was to make three different types of prototype cell and depending on whether I can check which indexPath the Table View Controller was selected, I can create the appropriate cell to make from the List of Subs View Controller by using the cell identifiers.p  pThe second, I was planning to make three different and seperate view controllers depicted in the image by View Controller 1  2  3 and create one prototype cell that is appropriate to each row. Im little hesistant about this approach considering that the cells in Main View Controller is all the same and it seems a bit redundant to create seperate view controllers. This way, I could tell what each List of Subs View Controller cells type would be simply by the segue identifier.p  pIf Scenario 1 is correct, how would I get the cell identifier from the Table View Controller when Im currently viewing List of Subs View Controller in Swiftp  pThank you in advancep

Negative 1583 pIm writing a program that basically allows a user to retrieve weather data for whatever zipcode they specify.

Confuse them at your peril.p  pSo what should you do in Sharepoint when you have data that would normally no pun intended be broken into pairs at least of 1toMany tablesp  pSurely its not acceptable to just add gobs of columns that will usually be empty. For example, if you might need as many as 77 columns of dates in a list that stores Travel expenses, but usually only uses a few, you dont want a list with columns named Date1...Date77, when usually most of those columns would be sitting there empty.p  pThe other option I can think of which isnt much  if any  better, is for the list to be its own Many tablelist this wayp  precodeTRAVEL EXPENSE LIST STRUCTURE ID GroupID Kind of an internal foreign key FirstName MiddleName LastName . . .  other uniquetotheentry columns DateOrdinal Date codepre  pThat would then store data likep  precodeTRAVEL EXPENSE LIST RECORD 1 ID  1 GroupID  42 FirstName  Warble MiddleName  Poundcake LastName  McGorkle . . .  other uniquetotheentry columns DateOrdinal  1 Date  692015   TRAVEL EXPENSE LIST RECORD 2 ID  2 GroupID  42 FirstName  already known, based on GroupID MiddleName   LastName   . . .

Alternatively, I could keep the access token small and just have it store a session id and populate that session with claimsrolespermission. Also I could put an expiration value in session and support sliding expiration, etc. and not even deal with refresh tokens. Am I missing what OpenID Connect is really aboutp  pstrongUpdatestrongp  pI just realized I need to clarify my question a bit. If I built a site where I allow users to login via Google, I see how OpenID Connect is necessary. Im allowing someone access to my site based on some OAuth authorization flow which doesnt prove authentication happened. But if Im building a bunch of services and I just want to issue tokens to access these service resources, isnt OAuth enough And if I wanted these tokens to contain rolesclaims so I can make authorization decisions in my services, isnt a JWT containing rolesclaims enough If feels like OpenID Connect wouldnt be necessary in this case.p

Negative 1583 pI am attempting to integrate the equationp  precodebg  dmatbg  releasevec. codepre  pcodeDmatcode is a 6x6 array of values and codebgcode is a 6x1 vector.

Right now, the code below is producing an codefresultscode that is an empty array, i.e. no results.p  pA little background is that this code is adapted from a MATLAB ode solver codeode15scode specifically.

Negative 1583 pOkay, so I am working on creating some commands in django, but I came across a intriguing issue with regards to my code here...p  precodefrom django.core.management.base import LabelCommand from optparse import makeoption  class CommandLabelCommand     requiressystemchecks  False     canimportsettings  True      args [none]     label  persons name      optionlist  LabelCommand.optionlist            makeoptioncap,          actionstoretrue,          destcapitalize,          help Tells Django to capitalize the name,               help  Runs a shell output that writes out Hello and the specified name      def handlelabelself, name, options         if options.getcapitalize, False             name  name.capitalize          print Hello s  name codepre  pWhat bothers me revolves around the codehandlelabelcode def in the latter part of the code, and this apparent difference between emselfem and emobjectem inputs. I thought that emselfem was the instance inherited from the main class  in this case, strongCommandstrong.

Either way, can someone help me clarify these differences Thanks.p

Negative 1583 pSo I moved a method into the DoWork event of a background worker so as to not kill the UI while accessing remote resources. I was fully aware as I was doing this that a bit of refactoring would be in order because the method accesses some controls on the form  not a thread friendly thing to do. To my amazement, no, it ran just fine. Odd but I didnt question it, though it still rattled around in my head. Strange.p  pThen I added another control, a ComboBox for timezone selection. I added the line to the DoWork method to access the value and BAM...Cross thread operation not valid.p  precode private void BackgroundWorker1DoWorkobject sender, DoWorkEventArgs e        backgroundWorker1.ReportProgress0, new StatusInitializing..., StatusState.Initializing       Query query  new Query      query.Hostname  textBoxHostname.Text                          Valid...      query.Port  Int32.ParsetextBoxPort.Text                     Valid...      query.Point  Int32.ParsetextBoxPoint.Text                   Valid...      query.Start  dateTimePickerStart.Value                        Valid...      query.End  dateTimePickerEnd.Value                            Valid...      query.Sampling  Sampling.ParsetextBoxSampling.Text          Valid...      query.Timezone  TimeZoneInfocomboBoxTimezone.SelectedValue  Not Valid        Run query  codepre  pSo why is it that all the other calls to controls created on the other thread are just fine, but this one blows up My guess is some sort of caching on the .NET side of things so that the underlying control is never actually accessed for the others. May have to dig into some Reference Source soon if there are no replies.p  pI suppose I should I add that I have fixed the error by simply building the Query object and passing it to the codeBackgroundWorker.RunWorkerAsynccode call.

Negative 1583 pIm using boostgraph and its Dijkstra implementation.p  pWhen someone is using the Dijkstra algorithm, it may be to know the shortest path between 2 nodes in a graph. But as you need to check all nodes in the graph to find the shortest path, usually like the boost algorithm Dijkstra gives you back all the distances between one origin point, and all the other nodes of the graph.p  pOne easy improvement of this algorithm when you only want the path between 2 nodes is to stop it when the algorithm reach the destination node. Then, you are sure that the distance that you have for this final destination node is the shortest one.p  pHow can one tell the boost Dijkstra algorithm to stop when it reaches a specific node p

Negative 1583 pI am trying to test the Login feature of my Android app with multiple userpassword entries that I have in an Excel. I have already been able to import that data from the Excel successfully and run the same test with each row with Run on all Rows option, but now I am facing a problem that I am not being able to solve.p  pAfter a test runs with one row, one the test starts over with a new row, it will not restart the app, but start at the same point where the previous one finished. I think this is not the expected behaviour, in general, since most of the GUI testing tools restart the app when testing a feature with parametrization data from Excel, mostly. Anyway, I fixed this by logging out in my app.p  pIn this case there was an easy solution by logging out. But what if I was testing a different feature in which I cannot simply log out. The problem is that in those different cases I would have to navigate back or do something that may fail and has nothing to do with the feature I am testing.p  pI am not sure if I am not using the right approach. Is there a good general solution for this issuep

Negative 1583 pI have two liferay portlets that work with OrientDB. First portlet constructs graphGraphBuilder, second visualizes itGraphVisualizer. I have also one application working with the OrientDB databaseOrientDBPersistence that both portlets use via spring beans. So it should work together in the following way. I create graph in GraphBuilder portlet and save it with custom label using OrientDBPersistence. Then I draw it using GraphVisualizer that asks OrientDBPersistence for graph with this particular label. p  pMy problem is that once I create graph1 and save it, I am able to vizualize it, but when I create graph2 it cannot be retrieved by GraphVisualizer, because it is not present in DB. However when I look into the studio I can see it there. Like the graphs I make are not visible to the Visualizer until I restart the portal. p  pSo in GraphDBPersistence I connect to OrientDB and I get the OrientGraph object to which I persist all my graphs with different labelp  precodeOrientGraph resultGraph  factory.getTx     resultGraph.setThreadModeOrientBaseGraph.THREADMODE.ALWAYSAUTOSET     return resultGraph codepre  pThen I build a graph in GraphBuilder that has injeced beans from  OrientDBPersistence to perform saving with Label1.
