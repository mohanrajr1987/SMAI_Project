When I debugged the issue, I found out that codemLastStatecode wasnt changing in such cases. It was still codeIDLEcode in case when incoming call ends where it should have been codeRINGINGcode or codeOFFHOOKcode. The reason for that was my app was getting killed and codemLastStatecode was being reinitialized.

Positive 23954 pI have two different apps. Both of them has codeBroadcastReceivercode class registered in codeAndroidManifest.xmlcode with same codeintentfiltercode. The codeintentfiltercode is codeandroid.provider.Telephony.SMSRECEIVEDcode. Both apps listen to incoming sms messages and do some according to SMS. Now my problem is the apps works well when only one installed. If I installed both the apps in my mobile when an SMS receives one app crashes. If I force stop anyone then the other app works fine. How to use two different codeBroadcastReciverscode of two different Apps with same Intentfilter Please do give your suggestions.

Positive 23954 pI am new to android and I hope that you can help me with something.p  pMy app is radio player that streaming radio from internet. I have two Activities , one for stations list and other for play screen. p  pHere , a pic a hrefhttpi.stack.imgur.comtPd3C.png relnofollowhttpi.stack.imgur.comtPd3C.pngap  pAs you can see my radio is playing in foreground service. My problem is playstop button. When I am in play screen activity everything works ok, but when I go back the play activity is destroyed and button losses state. p  pWhen I am launching playscreen from notification everything work ok because I set a variable and I am sending that value from service to set the button state. But that is service and I know that music is playing so I know that I need to set button to stop.p  pI tried sending broadcast receiver from service to playscreen, but   reciever is send only when service is started so that doesnt helped. p  pIs there a way to sending reciever while service is running, for examplep  popen activity B  press play buttonstart service  get reciever  go back to activity A open activity B  get recieverp  pIf I put the receiver on onStartCommand method the broadcast will be send only when  service is started, in  my case I need brodcast while service is running.p  pMaybe broadcast is not good solution for this,tell me if there is another solution.  I am trying with broadcast bacause I want to compare radio namein notification with radio name in playscreen and set the button.p  pHere is playscreen code for setting view and button p  precode Override protected void onCreateBundle savedInstanceState      super.onCreatesavedInstanceState     setContentViewR.layout.playscreen      pom  getIntent.getIntExtrapomosna,1       url  getIntent.getStringExtralink      name  getIntent.getStringExtraime          img  getIntent.getIntExtraimage, R.drawable.musicicon         icon  getIntent.getIntExtraicon, R.drawable.musicicon         play  Button findViewByIdR.id.playButon     TextView txt  TextView findViewByIdR.id.imenaradio     ImageView slika  ImageView findViewByIdR.id.imageofradio         ffmp  null     txt.setTextname     slika.setImageResourceimg     ifpom2         musicisplaying  true         play.setBackgroundResourceR.drawable.buttonstop           play.setOnClickListenernew View.OnClickListener          Override         public void onClickView v              buttonPlayStop                    private void buttonPlayStop     ifmusicisplaying         play.setBackgroundResourceR.drawable.buttonstop          playMusic          musicisplaying  true          else          ifmusicisplaying             play.setBackgroundResourceR.drawable.buttondisabled2             stopMusic             musicisplaying  false                 private void stopMusic      stopServicenew IntentPlayScreen.this, MusicService.class   private void playMusic      startServicenew IntentPlayScreen.this, MusicService.class.putExtralink, url.putExtraime, name.putExtraslika, icon.putExtraimage, img   codepre  pand here is my service code for seting playerp  precodeOverride public IBinder onBindIntent intent       TODO Return the communication channel to the service.     throw new UnsupportedOperationExceptionNot yet implemented    Override public void onCreate      pom  1     stopOnCall       bufferIntent  new IntentBROADCASTBUFFER    Override public void onDestroy      stopForegroundtrue     ifmgr  null          mgr.listenphoneStateListener, PhoneStateListener.LISTENNONE           ffmp.stop     ffmp.release        Override public int onStartCommandIntent intent, int flags, int startId      nameOfRadio  intent.getStringExtraime     imageOfRadio  intent.getIntExtraslika, R.drawable.musicicon     cover  intent.getIntExtraimage, R.drawable.musicicon      url  intent.getStringExtralink       startForeground1, setUpAsForeground      playurl     stop music on incoming call       return STARTSTICKY     private void playString x      ifpom2          ffmp.reset          ffmp  new FFmpegMediaPlayer     ffmp.setAudioStreamTypeAudioManager.STREAMMUSIC      try          ffmp.setDataSourcex             sendbuffer          ffmp.prepareAsync      catch IOException e          Toast.makeTextthis, Error, Toast.LENGTHLONG         e.printStackTrace                   Toast.makeTextthis,Bufering,Toast.LENGTHSHORT.show             sendBuffering     ffmp.setOnPreparedListenernew FFmpegMediaPlayer.OnPreparedListener          Override         public void onPreparedFFmpegMediaPlayer ffmp               ffmp.start              sendBufferingComplete              pom  2                  codepre  pnotification code this is in service class  but I am posting separately to be more clear while reading p  precodeNotification setUpAsForeground    NotificationManager manager            NotificationManagergetSystemServiceContext.NOTIFICATIONSERVICE      Intent intent  new Intentthis, PlayScreen.class   intent.putExtraimage, cover   intent.putExtralink, url   intent.putExtraime, nameOfRadio   intent.putExtrapomosna,2   intent.putExtraicon,imageOfRadio   PendingIntent pendingIntent            PendingIntent.getActivitythis, 0, intent, PendingIntent.FLAGUPDATECURRENT    NotificationCompat.Builder builder  new NotificationCompat.Builderthis   builder.setTickerRadio is starting   builder.setSmallIconimageOfRadio    builder.setContentTitlenameOfRadio   builder.setContentTextplaying   builder.setContentIntentpendingIntent    Notification notification  builder.build        return notification codepre  pp  pThank you.p

Positive 23954 pI know this question has asked many times and it has many answers but none of post has solved my problem.

Negative 23954 pIs it possible to change java lookandfeel without modifying the program in a realworld environmentp  pI know that theoretically the answer is yes. I also created demo applications and changed the lookandfeel even at runtime and it worked. But when I created a real application with lots of controls lookandfeel change was not really workingp  ul liDifferent lookandfeels have different bugs or strange features. For instance some of them creates the same style for JTextField and JFormattedTextField, some of them uses different styles. This change can be quite annoying for users.li liControl sizes are not the same using different fonts, different borders, so sometimes the window looks ugly after change.li liKeyboard shortcuts can also be different.li li...li ul  pIn my applications after lookandfeel change actually instead of changing the lookandfeel I tried using the same lookandfeel with different skins I always have to modify the application. Not a very big modification, but lots of small modifications which makes lookandfeel change difficult.p  pAm I just very unlucky with the lookandfeels I tried currently using a hrefhttpwww.l2fprod.comskinlf relnofollowskinlfa, or lookandfeel change is not that easy as in small demo applicationsp  pUPDATE Im using Swing and changing to other GUI library is not possible for me right now.p  pstrongUPDATE2strong It seems to me the question was not clear. I do know how to change the lookandfeel. My questions is Is it possible to create a real application where changing lookandfeel or the skin of the lookandfeel is an easy task Currently if I change the lookandfeel it is not enough to change 2 or 3 lines, I have to review the whole application and fix quite  a few problems caused by the lookandfeel change. dhiller suggested replacing skinlf with a better lookandfeel. Can you show me a skinable lookandfeel where skin replacement works betterp
Negative 23954 pOur product contains a taskmanager system that allows applications to run code in a DLL upon a scheduled interval, specify rules about whether a failure of the task should disable the related application, etc. Mostly its used for dataupload, datadownload, local database maintenance, etc. One of the functions used is to sync the devices time via NTP and set the OS timezone info. For this, we use OpenNetCFs DateTimeHelper class, which seems to serve as a wrapper around Win32 PInvokes.p  pOne of the other features of the task manager is that if a task runs longer than its allotted time window, the task manager will Thread.Abort it to allow other tasks to run. Were seeing an alarming number of thread abortions in which the highest function on the stack is OpenNetCF.WindowsCE.NativeMethods.SetTimeZoneInformation.

Negative 23954 pI have a Google calendar embedded on a webpage, with events related to activities the site is organizing. Some calendar events have links that redirect the user to a page, within the same website, which has more information and the option to enroll in the event.p  pThe problem however, is that since the end of last month, Google imposed a redirect notice that doesnt even automatically redirect. The links I create on events are changed by Google and, once a user clicks on a link, a new tab opens leading to a page with a redirect warning that the user must click.

Negative 23954 pMy latest contract project successfully concluded a couple of weeks ago, and Ive been pounding the job sites looking for new work. Its been six or seven years since I last ireallyi looked at these sites, so maybe the phrase, .NET Programmer, or variants, has come to mean something. But, danged if I know whatp  pMy primary language is C. When developing web functionality, I use that along with ASP.NET, JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. So, from my perspective, I have over six years of experience as a .NET Programmer. Employers, or at least their HR departments, however, dont see it that way. p  pDuring initial phone calls, in response to how much .NET experience I have, Ill say six years of C and ASP.NET. In the majority of cases, the interviewer responds with, Yeah, but how much direct .NET programming At that point, I know Im not going to get a substantive interview, because the screener and I arent speaking the same language.p  pTo me, .NET comprises the Framework and the Common Language Runtime. I am doing .NET programming when I use some language, in my case C, to make use of the Framework to create an application, utility, or some webfunctionality. And, the code I write runs in the CLR. If .NET programming means something beyond that, then I think of developingupdating the Framework classes and the CLR. So far as I know, however, that work is MSs exclusive domain. Not speaking, of course, of inheritance, extension, overriding, etc. p  pSo, if not C or VB, J, etc. and ASP.NET, what does .NET Programming mean p  pAny thoughts greatly appreciated. p

Negative 23954 pI have not worked with parameters in ADO.Net very much.  Im writing a custom .Net data provider modeled on SqlClient, and have to implement the IsNullable property in my parameter class, which inherits from DbParameter.  My data provider will not support stored procedures, so I will only be supporting Input substitution style parameters.p  pThe MSDN docs are rather unclear on the functionality of IsNullable, stating Gets or sets a value that indicates whether the parameter accepts null values.  Googling turns up a lot of people confused about what IsNullable does, saying that setting IsNullable to false does not prohibit them from using a parameter will a null value, as they would have expected.p  pBased on this, I am thinking that perhaps the IsNullable property pertains to usage with a stored procedure, and whether or not the stored procedures parameter is nullable, not whether the parameter value can be null.p  pIn that case, since I wont have stored procedures, my implementation can just bep  precode        public override bool IsNullable  get  return false  set   codepre  pTo avoid having to fiddle around with some test code to see how SqlParameters implementation of IsNullable works, Id appreciate it if someone experienced in writing code using parameters could explain IsNullable.p

Negative 23954 pIm using a localconnection to allow communication between an actionscript 2 swf and an actionscript 3 swf.br  Localconnection objects share a global namespace across a users pc.  So, this means, a user can fire up my flash app in one browser, and submit commands, back and forth, which is what i want. But the user can also fire up another browser, and all commands sent to my application will be handled by the first application if its still loaded in the first browser.  For my purposes, this is very bad.  When I make the LocalConnection, I specify an id, but the id must be known to the actionscript 2 swfs, and therein I find a problem.  I dont know how to let the actionscript 2 swfs know what the unique id is.  Any ideas as to what could be donep

Negative 23954 pstrongScenariostrongp  hr  pI am attempting to implement supervised learning over a data set within a Java GUI application. The user will be given a list of items or reports to inspect and will label them based on a set of available labels. Once the supervised learning is complete, the labelled instances will then be given to a learning algorithm. This will attempt to order the rest of the items on how likely it is the user will want to view them. p  pTo get the most from the users time I want to preselect the reports that will provide the most information about the entire collection of reports, and have the user label them. As I understand it, to calculate this, it would be necessary to find the sum of all the mutual information values for each report, and order them by that value. The labelled reports from supervised learning will then be used to form a Bayesian network to find the probability of a binary value for each remaining report.p  pstrongExamplestrong  p  hr  pHere, an artificial example may help to explain, and may clear up confusion when Ive undoubtedly used the wrong terminology  Consider an example where the application displays news stories to the user. It chooses which news stories to display first based on the users preference shown. Features of a news story which have a correlation are codecountry of origincode, codecategorycode or codedatecode. So if a user labels a single news story as interesting when it came from Scotland, it tells the machine learner that theres an increased chance other news stories from Scotland will be interesting to the user. Similar for a category such as Sport, or a date such as December 12th 2004.p  pThis preference could be calculated by choosing any order for all news stories e.g. by category, by date or randomly ordering them, then calculating preference as the user goes along. What I would like to do is to get a kind of head start on that ordering by having the user to look at a small number of specific news stories and say if theyre interested in them the supervised learning part. To choose which stories to show the user, I have to consider the entire collection of stories. This is where Mutual Information comes in. For each story I want to know how much it can tell me about all the other stories when it is classified by the user. For example, if there is a large number of stories originating from Scotland, I want to get the user to classify at least one of them. Similar for other correlating features such as category or date. The goal is to find examples of reports which, when classified, provide the most information about the other reports.p  pstrongProblemstrongp  hr  pBecause my math is a bit rusty, and Im new to machine learning Im having some trouble converting the definition of Mutual Information to an implementation in Java. Wikipedia describes the equation for Mutual Information asp  pimg srchttpupload.wikimedia.orgmathebfebf36c4eb951e4273107124ff4c1f2ae.png altmutual information equationp  pHowever, Im unsure if this can actually be used when nothing has been classified, and the learning algorithm has not calculated anything yet.p  pAs in my example, say I had a large number of new, unlabelled instances of this class  p  precodepublic class NewsStory      private String countryOfOrigin     private String category     private Date date      constructor, etc.  codepre  pIn my specific scenario, the correlation between fieldsfeatures is based on an emexact matchem so, for instance, one day and 10 years difference in date are equivalent in their inequality. p  pThe factors for correlation e.g. is date more correlating than category are not necessarily equal, but they can be predefined and constant. Does this mean that the result of the function codepx,ycode emisem the predefined value, or am I mixing up termsp  pstrongThe Questionstrong emfinallyemp  hr  pHow can I go about implementing the mutual information calculation given this fake example of news stories Libraries, javadoc, code examples etc. are all welcome information. Also, if this approach is fundamentally flawed, explaining why that is the case would be just as valuable an answer.p  hr  pPS. I am aware of libraries such as Weka and Apache Mahout, so just mentioning them is not really useful for me. Im still searching through documentation and examples for both these libraries looking for stuff on Mutual Information specifically. What would really help me is pointing to resources code examples, javadoc where these libraries help with mutual information.p
Negative 23954 pIm new to Django coming from Rails, and I am finding the Django fixtures most commonly JSON from what I gather, to be somewhat awkward and unweildy, at least in comparison to the rails fixtures that I am familiar with.  I liked being able to embed some ruby code, e.g  codelt Time.now gtcode, or reference other fixtures by name when relating things with foreign keys so as to avoid having to keep track of ids.p  pSo the question, how do you more experience Django developers build your fixtures.  Do you sit down and write the JSONXMLYAML by hand, or are there other tools available to help similar to what rails gives me  Or is it just easiest to create some data in .manage.py shell and dump that data to a fixture, instead of writing the fixtures by hand  Or even still, do you find yourself putting a lot of data in your setUpself method in your test classes.  Maybe writing these things out by hand is less tedious once you have a little more experiencep

Negative 23954 pHey, all.  Working on my first Rails app.p  pIve searched all around  read a bunch of tutorials, articles, and forum posts, watched some screencasts, and Ive found a few examples that come close to what Im trying to do notably a hrefhttprailscasts.comepisodes154polymorphicassociation relnofollowhttprailscasts.comepisodes154polymorphicassociationa and ep 196 about nested model forms, but not exactly.p  pI have two models Podcast and BlogPost that need to be commentable, and I have a Comment model that is polymorphically related to both.  The railscasts above had a very similar example ep 154, but Ryan used a full set of nested routes, so there were specific templates for adding and editing comments.  What I want to do is show the list of comments right on the Podcast or BlogPost page, along with an Add Comment form at the bottom.  I dont need a separate add templateroute, and I dont need the ability to edit, only delete.p  pThis is a pretty common design on the web, but I cant find a Rails example specifically about this pattern.  Heres my current understandingp  pI need routes for the create and delete actions, of course, but there are no templates associated with those.  Im also guessing that the right approach is to create a partial that can be included at the bottom of both the Podcast and BlogPost show template.  The logical name for the partial seems to me to be something like comments.html.haml.  I know its a common convention to have the object passed to the partial be named after the template, but calling the object comments seems to not match my use case, since what I really need to pass is the commentable object Podcast or BlogPost.  So, I guess Id use the locals option for the render partial call  commentable  podcast.p  pInside the partial, I could call commentable.comments to get the comments collection, render that with a second partial this time with the conventional use case, calling the partial comment.html.haml, then create a form that submits to... what  RESTwise, it should be a POST to the collection, which would be podcastblogpostidcomments, and I think the helper for that is podcastcommentspathpodcast if it were a podcast  not sure what to do though, since Im using polymorphic comments.  That would trigger the Comment.create action, which would then need to redirect back to the podcastblogpost path podcastblogpostid.p  pIts all a bit overwhelming, which is why I was really hoping to find a screencast or example that specifically implements this design.p

Negative 23954 pSuppose my strongWinFormsstrong application has a business entity Order, the entity is used in multiple views, each view handles a different domain or usecase in the application.

Negative 23954 pthis may seem odd but I was wondering if it was possible to add custom header details to emails already in an inbox. Like lets say I wish to add in the Header of the email something like  myvariable  myvalue and then be able to query it somehow. Im looking at code from Iloha mail and most of the details like subject and from recieved etc are in the headers and you can search through them. SO is it possible to add my own custom variable to an email header and query it in the same way How can it be done using phpp  pEDIT p  pThanks I know how you can modify the headers of sent messages plus also query for custom variables in message headers however in this case I want to know if it would be possible to add a custom variable in a recieved message already in my inbox. Actually let me define the situation here.p  pIm working on a google apps solution which requires maintaining references to emails. Basically the application is as such that when an email comes in  we create an order from that email and wish to maintain a reference to that EXACT email by some kind of identifier which would enable us to identify that email. p  pThe fact is that we dont want to download the emails in a database and maintain a separate store as we would want to keep all the emailing on GMAIL. We just needp  pA way to be able to link to a specific email permanently  the UID is just a sequence number and not very reliable. We couldnt find any property of emails that could function as a unique ID or primary key and so we thought if we could instead generate a key on our end and store it in a custom variable on the email itself. However it seems unfortunately that there isnt a way to manipulate headers of an already existing email.p  p is there any solution to this problem I could use any IDEA p

Negative 23954 pIm trying to optimize up some horrendously complicated SQL queries because it takes too long to finish.p  pIn my queries, I have dynamically created SQL statements with lots of the same functions, so I created a temporary table where each function is only called once instead of many, many times  this cut my execution time by 34.p  pSo my question is, can I expect to see much of a difference if say, 1,000 datediff computations are narrowed to 100p  pEDIT The query looks like this  p  precodeSELECT DISTINCT M.MID, M.RE FROM TEMP INNER JOIN M ON TEMP.MIDM.MID  WHERE  TEMP.Property11  AND  DATEDIFF year, M.DOB, date2  gt 15  AND  DATEDIFF year, M.DOB, date2  lt 17  codepre  pwhere these are being generated dynamically as strings put together in bits and pieces and then executed so that various parameters can be changed along each iteration  mainly the last lines, containing all sorts of DATEDIFF queries.p  pThere are about 420 queries like this where these datediffs are being calculated like so. I know that I can pull them all into a temp table easily 1,000 datediffs becomes 50  but is it worth it, will it make any difference in seconds Im hoping for an improvement better than in the tenths of seconds.p

This UpdatePanel has its UpdateMode set to conditional and has one trigger the TextChanged event of the search TextBox. p  pIts very simple.  p  pAnd it works beautifully, almost. p  pWhenever I change the search type, the very next search does a full postback. All subsequent searches do partial postbacks as desired unless I change the search type again. p  pThere is one exception to this rule if I load the page and immediately change the search type, it doesnt do a full postback.  So the first change of the DropDownList before any postback full or partial does not trigger a full postback. p  pFull Disclosure Im doing a lot of JavaScript to change the appearance of the gridview during async requests.  I dont detail it here because it seems unrelated. This problem only occurs when a DropDownList with no JavaScript wired up is changed. p  pAny ideas p  pThis is driving me crazy.

Negative 23954 pI am trying to wrap my head around why we first approach the problem of design and decide upon a visual method UML, instead of starting with formal specifications that happen to also be executable RAD prototyping, we start with diagrams that cant be easily proven to work.  So when it comes time to prove properties of a model, we find we need to define  constraints into our design, so we design a formal syntax OCL to define the constraints on the model.   I am having a hard time understanding this leap back to where we started. I find OCL encumbered UML designs even samples shown in brochures unreadable, even more impenetrable than the myriad of UML symbols and conventions.  So what I want to know is What are the key areas where OCL is used in the working software development world today, and for whom is it relevant or worthwhile to learn  What does your job role look like Do architects who never write code use UML and OCL, or do programmers who also design and architect the systems with the same team that implements it, use it toop  p[updated Secondly, it occurs to me that Agile development seems kind of opposed to  Heavyweight procedures, and that a domain specific language for design diagram constraints like OCL doesnt seem very Agile.  Is UMLOCL used in ANY Agile shops, or is it universally eschewed by Scrummers]p

Negative 23954 pIm using git to test out a dojo widget Im developing.  I am developing this with someone on a nix machine and Im running into issues with how everything is put together.p  pdojo is organized by a folder convention and git wants everything to be inside a single folder. The other coder on nix is using symlinks to place the files where they need to be within the dojo folder structure but creating shortcuts to these files on windows, which i see as being the windows equivalent, causes IIS to redirect to the shortcut origin location breaking all of the relative paths within the file.  Is there a more proper way to do this since coping pasting the files where they need to be from the git repository is a PITA. Is there a better way to do this.p

So pretty much every method has a piece of code that starts like thisp  precodeString LOGMETHOD  nameOfMethodString,ListltLonggtvoid iflogger.isTraceEnabled       Object[] params  new Object[]  string, list      logger.traceCompanyMessages.newMethodInstanceMessagethis, LOGMETHOD, params   codepre  pand end like this either in a codefinallycodeclause or just at the end of the methodp  precodeiflogger.isTraceEnabled       logger.traceCompanyMessages.leaveMethodInstanceMessagethis, LOGMETHOD   codepre  pThere is actually more code to it, but this is the basic idea. This is cluttering the code and other coders are constantly messing it up with their own interpretations which dont use the specific codeCompanyMessagescodeclass which is needed to format the messages to be read by the monitoring tools. So I am looking for a way to get rid of emallem code above and just provide all methods which need tracelogging with annotations like codeLogBeforelogLevelcode amp codeLogAfterlogLevelcode. p  pThe reason I choose this solution is to make it so other developers dont have to learn anything new but to use annotations instead of code. Im working in a server environment in which we deploy hundreds of web applications and dozens of developers. So I have been looking for a way to implement this in a web application without a lot of extra coding or additional large libraries. This means Im looking for a small, stable AOP implementation using annotations similar to those I proposed, easy to configure in each web application. Performance is also important. What is the simplest example to implement this with AOP p  pEdit I did find a hrefhttpwww.javacodegeeks.com201101aspectorientedprogrammingspringaop.html relnofollowsomething very similara to what Im looking for, but this has a couple of problems. All classes that need logging must be configured, which would be more resource intensive than just using annotations. Would the spring configuration codeltaopaspectjautoproxygtcode fix thatp

Negative 23954 pstrongSome backgroundstrong  I have a site with a table displaying a list of entities. Using jQuery I make it possible to click on a row in the table which will load some extra data about the selected entity using AJAX. A new row is inserted into the table below the clicked row. This row contains more detailed information about the entity and is not really a row, just in HTML terms. It contains a whole bunch of data. When you click on another row, the details row currently shown will be hidden and the details row for the newly clicked entity is shown loaded using AJAX if not loaded yet. No problems here.p  pOn the details row there is also a select box. After loading the details row using Ajax, I want to bind the onchange event of the select. I do the following jQuery selectionp  precodetr.entitydetails[dataentityid  entityId  ] selectSelectedDropDownValue codepre  pstrongThe problemstrong This also works fine, except in some very particular case which I havnt been able to completely define yet. Sometimes it doesnt select the codeselectcode element. I use VS2010 to debug and entered these two items into my watch windowp  precodetr.entitydetails[dataentityid  entityId  ] selectSelectedDropDownValue.length tr.entitydetails[dataentityid  entityId  ] select[idSelectedDropDownValue].length codepre  pIn the cases where the first one doesnt select anything, the second one emdoesem. This is really weird to me, because I thought that those two selectors are equivalent.p  pThe situation when I could produce this is I have two entities in my table. p  ul liI click on the bottom one first no problem then I click on the top one no problem.li liI click on the top one first no problem then I click on the bottom one PROBLEM.li ul  pI have no idea what could cause this. Im thinking maybe something with me inserting new rows and hiding them in javascript, causing the selection to go a bit off. But that would be a bug I suppose. Or maybe it has something to do with that the details row contains another table and the select is in side that inner table.p  h2EDITh2  pTo add some more information. I tested this under IE9 and Chrome. I am developing an ASP.NET MVC 3 application using jQuery 1.5.1. The details row is generated by a partial view. In this partial view I use the Html Helper codeDropDownListForcode. This helper generates the select element based on a C property you pass to the function. It uses the propertys name to generate a name and id for the element. This causes all the select elements in the page to have the same id. As some people already mentioned, that would probably be the cause.p

Negative 23954 pIn our product we have an inlined mutex implementation, using a variety of platform and compiler specific methods for the hardware specific parts.  One of our rules for some overoptimized code that attempts to cheat, is that if a variable is accessed outside of the mutex and within, then that variable must be declared volatile.  I figured this applied to opaque mutex implementations too such as pthreadmutexlockunlock, and this led to an interesting debate.p  pIts been asserted by one person that this is an indication of a compiler bug especially when the mutex implementation is inlined and not opaque to the compiler.  I gave the following example to dispute thisp  precodeint v  pSharedMemgtmyVariable   asm volatile isync   memory   v  pSharedMemgtmyVariable  codepre  pIn this LinuxPPC gcc code fragment, the compiler doesnt have any knowledge of the run time effects of the isync, other than what we can tell it via the memory constraint.  Youd find such an isync instruction at the tail end of a mutex acquision to prevent any execution of the instructions that follow the successful acquire of the mutex before the mutex was actually held so if a load had been executed before the isync it would have to be discarded.p  pIn this code fragment, we have the compiler barrier that prevents a rewrite of the code as if it were the followingp  precodeint v  pSharedMemgtmyVariable  v  pSharedMemgtmyVariable   asm volatile isync   memory  codepre  porp  precodeasm volatile isync   memory   int v  pSharedMemgtmyVariable  v  pSharedMemgtmyVariable  codepre  pie both of these compiler reorderings should be inhibited by the strongvolatilestrong attributep  pWe also have the isync itself that prevents the first reordering at run time but I dont think prevents the second which isnt as interesting.p  pHowever, my question is that if myVariable is emnotem declared volatile, whether or not the memory constraint is sufficient that gcc would necessarily reload v after the isync  Id still be inclined to mandate volatile for such a pattern since this sort of code is too touchy with all the platform specific compiler builtins.  That said, if we reduce the discussion to just GCC and this code fragment, is this asm memory constraint enough to have code that is generated with a pair of loads instead of just onep

Negative 23954 pI have a jQuery project using drag and drop.p  pAt one point in the interaction, I drag one draggable element A somewhere else on the page. Sometimes, this goes over another draggable element B. Unfortunately, this seems to fire the drag event for element B, but no associated drop element fires. This means that when I drag A over B, I end up clearing css classes from B that never get readded since the drop event for B never fires.p  pI can give a more detailed example if needed, but all Id really like to do is stop this behaviour some way  either by firing the associated drop events or not firing the drag events for B.p  pAny suggestionsp

Negative 23954 pYou have a roomfull of balances and weights. Each balance weighs ten pounds and is considered perfectly balanced when the sum of weights on its left and right sides are exactly the same. You have placed some weights on some of the balances, and you have placed some of the balances on other balances. Given a description of how the balances are arranged and how much additional weight is on each balance, determine how to add weight to the balances so that they are all perfectly balanced.p  pThere may be more than one way to balance everything, but always choose the way that places additional weight on the lowest balances.p  pThe input file will begin with a single integer, N, specifying how many balances there are. Balance 0 is specified by lines 1 and 2, balance 1 is specified by lines 3 and 4, etc... Each pair of lines is formatted as followsp  precodeWL ltbalancesgt WR ltbalancesgt codepre  pWL and WR indicate the weight added to the left and right sides, respectively.  is a spacedelimited list of the other balance that are on that side of this balance.  may contain zero or more elements.p  pConsider the following inputp  precode4 0 1 0 2 0 0 3 3 0 0 0  Balance 0 has balance 1 on its left side and balance 2 on its right side Balance 1 has balance 3 on its right side Balance 2 has three pounds on its left side Balance 3 has nothing on it codepre  pSince balance 3 has nothing on it it is already perfectly balanced, and weighs a total of 10 pounds. Balance 2 has no other balance on it, so all we need to do is balance it by putting three pounds on its right side. Now it weighs a total of 16 pounds. Balance 1 has balance three on its right side, which weighs 10 pounds, so we just put 10 pounds on its left side. Balance 1 weighs a total of 30 pounds. Balance 0 has balance 1 on its left side 30 pounds, and balance 2 on its right side 16 pounds, we can balance it by adding 14 pounds to the right side.p  pThe output should be N lines long, with the nth line listing the weight added to the nth balance, formatted as followsp  precodeltindexgt ltweight added to left sidegt ltweight added to right sidegt codepre  pSo the output for this problem would bep  precode0 0 14 1 10 0 2 0 3 3 0 0 codepre  pI tried but Im really bad at programming I guess.

Negative 23954 pCan someone walk me through how to hide the standard core data settersp  pI know there is not really a way to define Private methods in ObjectiveC, but read about using an extension to achieve a similar result.  The problem is, I want to apply this to core data classes.  I would like to hide the standard setters created for some attributes, and only call them from inside other, exposed setters.p  pAn example  My core data object has a BOOL collected and a date dateCollected.  I have figured out how to add setDateCollected to setCollected, but now I would like to hide set collected so that it cant be called directly so easily when I might forget to also set dateCollected manually.p  pTo clarify, the part that is tripping me up is the dynamic calls  I dont know where these should live.p  pEDIT  I guess I missed a part.  I can move the property declaration into the implementation file just fine.  But I want the setter to be hidden, and the getter to remain public.  I guess I need to replace the property, but I dont know how to do this for a core data object.p

Negative 23954 pI am trying to show a splash screen, and not freeze up the application, while it connects to a database. Normal connections to MSSQL via ADO take about 300 msec, and this does not cause the main thread to show not responding on windows.p  pHowever in the case of a a network error or b a configuration mistake invalid SQL server hostnameinstance, it takes 60 seconds to time out.  This not only makes the application nonresponsive, but its almost impossible to show any error or message when its going to freeze. I could pop up a message before I start the connection but theres really no solution when the main thread blocks for 60 seconds.p  pThe solution seems to be to move the connection to a background thread. This lead to the following codep  ol lipa TThreadclass that makes the background connection and some SyncObj like a TEvent used to send a signal back to the main thread.pli lipA loop in the main thread with this codep  precodeBackgroundThread.StartConnecting while not BackgroundThread.IsEventSignalled do begin    Application.ProcessMessages  keep message pump alive. end  continue startup reports error if db connection failed codepreli ol  pIs this the right way to go My hesitations involve the following elements of the above solutionp  pA.  I would be calling Application.ProcessMessages, which I consider an extreme code smell.This might be a permissible exception to this rulep  pB.  Im introducing threads into the startup of an application, and Im worried about introducing bugs.p  pIf anyone has a reference implementation that is known to be free of race conditions, that can do a background connection to ADO, and is known to be a safe approach, that would be really helpful.

The locations of the squares are to be determined in the app.p  pSo I guess I will need to measure the card and find the coordinates of the proper spots to print on. Then convert those to pixels  . p  pAnother thought is to scan the preprinted card and somehow use it as an image, draw on it and then print it.p  pPerhaps combining the app with tools like Word or some image processing app might be a better option.

Negative 23954 pJust for some context, I am testing running a Django 1.4 app behind nginxgunicorn on webfaction in order to run the admin parts securely. This is working fine. The nginx proxy is redirecting requests from codehttpdomain.comadmincode to codehttpsdomain.comadmincode and Django is serving everything up without issue. The greater issue is the static files. I have these being served up from a separate static directory that is accessed both via http and https. My problem is how to render the static urls in my apps templates as well as the admin interface templates in such a way that the appropriate prefix is applied http or https depending on whether the request is secured or not. p  pFor my apps templates, Ive used the code STATICURL pathtoresourcecode convention, which allows me to easily adjust the STATICURL context variable in a templatecontextprocessor function. But this doesnt have any effect on the administrative templates which use the code static pathtoresource code templatetag to render the url.  p  pThe best I have come up with is to make two url options in strongsettings.pystrongp  precodeSTATICURL  httpsmydomain.comstatic NONSECUREDSTATICURL  httpmydomain.comstatic  codepre  pThen added the following function to strongTEMPLATECONTEXTPROCESSORSstrongp  precodedef setstaticurlrequest     if not request.issecure         return  STATICURL settings.NONSECUREDSTATICURL  codepre  pThis is actually working, but it seems rather hackish. Im also quite new to Django and I feel there must be a better or more appropriate way of doing this. p

First, I thank you for your help.p  pHere is my question  The lead developper told that for the project iOS 5, they will not use Core Data to deal with the database of the app, but they will use their own SQLite libraries. I have been told by the lead dev that Core Data will not fit in that project, because of the data they are dealing with... No more detailsp  pSince Core Data uses SQLite, and so will the library they created, do you have any ideas why Core Data could be a problem in generalp  pI really thank you if you have any clue.p  pstrongEDIT strongp  pIve just learnt that the lead is creating an sqlite database and we are going to use it in the app. And the fields contains a lot of html a lot of special characters like  or amp or lt, and we are going to display it in some UIWebViews.

Negative 23954 pIm developing an online application for education research, where I frequently have the need for emveryem complex SQL queries p  ul liqueries usually include 520 joins, often joined to the same table several timesli lithe SELECT field often ends up being 3040 lines tall, between derived fields  calculations and CASE statementsli liextra WHERE conditions are added in the PHP, based on users permissions amp other security settingsli lithe user interface has search amp sort controls to add custom clauses to the WHERE  ORDER  HAVING clauses.li ul  pCurrently this app is built on PHP  MYSQL  Jquery for the moving parts. This grew out of old Dreamweaver code. Soon we are going to rebuild the application from scratch, with the intent to consolidate, clean, and be ready for future expansion. While Im comfortable in PHP, Im learning bits about Rails and realizing, Maybe it would be better to build version 2.0 on a more modern framework instead. But before I can commit to hours of tutorials, I need to know if the Rails querying system ActiveRecord will meet our query needs.p  pHeres an example of one query challenge Im concerned about. A query must select from 3 instances of a table, and get comparable information from each instancep  precodeSELECT p1.name AS myname, pm.name AS mothername, pf.name AS fathername FROM people p1     JOIN mother pm ON p1.motherid  pm.id     JOIN father pf ON p1.fatherid  pf.id      etc. etc. etc. WHERE p1.age BETWEEN 10 AND 16  selects this info for 10200 people codepre  pOr, a similar example, more representative of our challenges. A raw data table joins multiple times to a coding choices table, each instance of which in turn has to look up the text associated with a key it storesp  precodeSELECT d., c1.codername AS namec1, c2.codername AS namec2, c3.codername AS namec3,      c1.result  c2.result  c3.result AS resultcombined,     mc1.selection AS selectedc1, mc2.selection AS selectedc2. mc3.selection AS selectedc3 FROM tdata d     LEFT JOIN tcodes c1 ON d.id  c1.dataid AND c1.category  1         LEFT JOIN tmenuchoice mc1 ON c1.menuchoice  mc1.id     LEFT JOIN tcodes c2 ON d.id  c2.dataid AND c2.category  2         LEFT JOIN tmenuchoice mc2 ON c2.menuchoice  mc2.id     LEFT JOIN tcodes c3 ON d.id  c3.dataid AND c3.category  3         LEFT JOIN tmenuchoice mc3 ON c3.menuchoice  mc3.id  WHERE d.datecompleted BETWEEN  AND      AND c1.coderid   codepre  pThese sorts of joins are straightforward to write in pure SQL, and when search filters and other varying elements are needed, a couple PHP loops can help to cobble strings together into a complete query. But I havent seen any Rails  ActiveRecord examples that address this sort of structure. If Ill need to run every query as pure SQL using findbysql, then maybe using Rails wont be much of an improvement over sticking with the PHP I know.p  pMy question is Does ActiveRecord support cases where tables need nicknames, such as in the queries above Can the primary table have an alias too in my examples, p1 or d How much control do I have over what fields are selected in the SELECT statement Can I create aliases for selected fields Can I do calculations amp select derived fields in the SELECT clause How about CASE statements p  pHow about setting WHERE conditions that specify the joined tables alias Can my WHERE clause include things like using the top example  WHERE pm.age BETWEEN p1.age AND 65 p  pThis sort of complexity isnt just an occasional bizarre query, its a constant and central feature of the application as its currently structured. My concern is not just whether writing these queries is possible within Rails amp ActiveRecord its whether this sort of need is supported by the Rails way, because Ill need to be writing a lot of these. So Im trying to decide whether switching to Rails will cause more trouble than its worth.p  pThanks in advance  if you have similar experiences with big scary queries in Rails, Id love to hear your story amp how it worked out.p

Basically, I want the footer to take full width especially on widescreens and laptops. The reason why I would like to stay away from 100 width is that I want my footer to still be large when the window is resized made smaller, not adjust itself on resize or according to the windows size. The footer will have some serious amount of data contained within it, and it would look bad on resize.p  pI could throw in a high amount of pixels in order to keep its width fixed, but wouldnt that create problems on laptops, for example scrollbar appearing although not necessaryp

Negative 23954 pI have a perl script which sends a lot of output to multiple subprocesses.  I need to be able to close my end of all the pipes and then wait for the subprocesses to finish their work.  So far Ive only succeeded at closing each pipe and waiting for each subprocess to finish one by one.

So I need to close my end of the pipe to indicate Im finished. for i0ilt24i      my file  fhsi     close file  unfortunately, this blocks until process i finishes     meanwhile all the other processes are waiting for EOF      on their STDIN before they can proceed.  So I end up waiting     for 24 processes to finish oneatatime instead of all at once  codepre  pOne way to get all the subprocesses to finish promptly closing their stdin is simply to let my script exit without closing the pipe filehandles at all, but thats no good because the script is part of a larger job that needs the subprocess work to actually be done before proceeding.p  pWhat is a simple way to close each subprocesses stdin so that they can all finish working and then wait for all of them to finish before proceeding  Ive tried forking off a child to close each pipe but that doesnt seem to work  only the parents close actually closes the stdin of the subprocess and waits for the subprocess to finish.p

Negative 23954 pThe idea is whether rain or shine, wet or fine, user must get that he paid for all out.p  pFrom Applep  pre Store Kit provides builtin functionality to restore transactions for nonconsumable products, autorenewable subscriptions and free subscriptions pre  pFor these transactions Apple Store Kit has good buildin tools. I want to focus on other types consumable in particular. One and only transaction information is an identifier and a receipt data which we receiving by Store Kit after successful purchase. Our application uses serverside model to deliver products to it. But there still much cases of losing purchase data, such as if the server lay down while user is making purchase via App Store so its not possible to send receipt to server to complete verification process.p  pCurrent workaround isp  ol liServer returns a list of product identifiersli liUser selects one app saves its identifier on device via SQLite or Core Data. Standart Apple Store transaction process goes right after that.li liIn case of success application saves receipt data in conjunction with its identifier on device and send it to server. If there were failure or cancelation the identifier is immediatelly removed from device.li liIf servers response is OK then app removes identifier with receipt data from device. Otherwise it will send requests to server periodically until successful response behaves.li ol  pBut this approach still has leaks. For example, user can remove application from device not waiting for transaction delivering to server, so there will not any proof about his purchase at all.p  pYour suggestionsp

Negative 23954 pI am following along the Microsoft tutorial Quickstart Adding a ListView Cant post link because of spam prevention for Windows 8 app development and I am attempting to simply show the raw data from my array in ListView format. I have slightly modified the tutorial so that I am using CSS Grids to structure the page as Microsoft recommends, I believe. The problem I am having is that when the ListView is situated outside of a Grid, it shows and displays perfectly, but, when located inside a CSS Grid, will not show up on my app. I have very limited knowledge in both CSS Grids and the new Windows 8 platforms so I am sure it is a simple mistake that I have made.

However, I suppose it should be down to how it traverse along the HTML Dom tree. p  pFor example p  precode            P                                         C1            C2                                                C11   C12     C21  C22 codepre  pFor find c12, the path is PC1C11C1C12 it could be different path depending on the structure, but its I can remember now p  pno matter c12 is class or id, it will be the same path, which means the same performance for C12 or P C1 .C12p  pMy first question is if my understanding is right Question 2 I keep thinking about performance of one to another and minimize my codes to put duplication together into functions, on the other hand, it takes time. Should I keep doing it or just to make it work first and change it later p  pThanks.p

Negative 23954 pI have a JAXWS RI server that does MTOM streaming. From the client, everything is fine. The server receives a StreamingDataHandler, and neither side uses much memory sending 1 GB. Retrieving the file, however, the server is reading the entire contents before sending it. The client is OK. Im using DataHandler on both ends, so that aspect of things is fine. I just dont want the server to read all the data from the InputStream before it starts sending. I have the following annotations on the implp  precodeMTOM StreamingAttachmentparseEagerly  false, memoryThreshold  1L WebService... codepre  pIve tried codeparseEagerlycode codetruecode and codefalsecode. I set the memory threshold low because Im not concerned about small performance hits for small files.p  pIs this a bug with JAXWS RI p

It likely has to do with regular expressions, but I absolutely cannot wrap my brain around them and all attempts to construct a fitting one have failed me.p

Negative 23954 pI have a scenario where I have search results that contain video content.  Each video item in the results has a thumbnail sized video player, so up to 10 html 5 video players can exist per result set. When the user clicks the thumbnail, the video goes fullscreen and automatically plays the video.  When the user exits fullscreen, the video pauses.p  pThis all works great on iOS devices, but on android I have significantly more even handling to worry about.  Heres the logic as I have it nowp  precode    goFullScreen function ev        var el                 ev.target,           isVideoFullscreen  el.webkitDisplayingFullscreen        el.webkitEnterFullScreen        the approach below is the only way I could get reliable fullscreen detection on android       window.bindresize, function e          if isVideoFullscreen  el.webkitDisplayingFullscreen            isVideoFullscreen  el.webkitDisplayingFullscreen            if isVideoFullscreen              el.load             el.play            else              el.pause                                 codepre  pEven though iOS does not need all of this even handling, it still works fine.  The problem with android is that when I exit fullscreen, the video pauses, but the poster image is replaced for the video I just paused with a still from the video to be expected, but all  subsequent videos in the result set have their poster image replaced with an ugly video icon.  As a result, the thumbnails just look like broken videos.  But if you tap them they still go fullscreen and play just fine.p  pIm testing on a Galaxy Nexus and a Galaxy SII.  I can say that the el.pause is not responsible, if removed the video will continue playing in the thumbnail and all video tags below it will still have the broken poster icon.p  pThis works as expected on desktop webkit browser and on iOS devices.  Only experiencing this issue on android 4 devices.  Also remember that the EnterFullscreen request has to happen in the scope its in.  Calling out of this scope will prevent it from working due to security restrictions on mobile devices.  Ive pretty much exhausted all ideas so Im looking here to hopefully get a few more.p  pAny suggestions would be greatly appreciated.p

Negative 23954 pSo I am trying to concatenate a bunch of input strings together as one string so I can save that to a text file. So far I am trying to write something like thisp  precodeNSString tempString  [[NSString alloc]initWithFormat, text1, text2, text3] codepre  pThe only problem with this is that I need a total of 30 strings stored this way.

Negative 23954 pNovice python user here. There are other ways to achieve this, but I believe this is my best option. I maintain an MS Access 2007 database .accdb that is used on offline TabletPCs in the field to collect data. When arriving back at the office, the user can reconnect to the server. Im trying to utilize the pyodbc module to loop through the tables and rows and insert records from the offline field database into the server master database. The selection part of the script appears to be working to grab the records in the offline field database and put them into a dictionary for later use. Recommendations based on the original post now has the insert part looping through the dictionary and creating parameterbased sql for inserting the records. However, the code throws the following error after two records are inserted into the first table in the loop. The next sql string is for the next table  so all records are inserted into the first table correctly and the error occurs when moving to the next table. p  precodeError HY010, [HY010] [Microsoft][ODBC Driver Manager] Function sequence error 0 SQLFetch codepre  pI read error information here but dont know what to make of it a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibrarywindowsdesktopms712424vvs.85.aspx relnofollowhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibrarywindowsdesktopms712424vvs.85.aspxap  precodeimport pyodbc  otherDbaseDict    connOtherDbase  pyodbc.connectDriverMicrosoft Access Driver .mdb, .accdb                                  DBQCother.accdb otherDbaseTables  connOtherDbase.cursor.tables  counter  0  for tblOther in otherDbaseTables     if tblOther.tablename.startswithtbl ignores MS sys tables         nameOther  tblOther.tablename         cursor  connOtherDbase.cursor         selectSQL  SELECT  FROM .formatnameOther generate SQL select syntax         cursor.executeselectSQL         rows  cursor.fetchall         for row in rows             counter  counter  1 counter digit used to create unique key, since table names repeat             otherDbaseDict.updatenameOtherstrcounterrow  connMainDbase  pyodbc.connectDriverMicrosoft Access Driver .mdb, .accdb                                 DBQCmain.accdb mainDbaseTables  connMainDbase.cursor.tables  beargle2 for tblMain in mainDbaseTables     if tblMain.tablename.startswithtbl         nameMain  tblMain.tablename          get all column names with list comprehension         columns  [row.columnname for row in cursor.columnstablenameMain]         for k, v in otherDbaseDict.iteritems             if nameMain in k                  build dynamic sql                 sql  INSERT into 01 values 2                  add question mark placeholders, one for each column                  value to insert                 sql  sql.formatnameMain, ,.joincolumns,                                  ,.joinlencolumns                   print sql                 cursor  connMainDbase.cursor                  execute parameterized insert                 cursor.executesql, v                 connMainDbase.commit codepre  pAny pointers on ways to reconcile the error Was just thinking, is this a cursor issue Do I need to resetrefresh or whatever it may be called after each connMainDbase.commit or before switching tables Execute dies once it finishes with the first table.

Negative 23954 pMy question is about operator overloading in python. I want to set, the priority or order of the methods calling in python, and Im looking for a pythonic way to do that. Below is a very bizarre example, but I think it will show you the point.p  pLets say we want to overload the codeposcode and the codecallcode operators in python, to make a syntax sugar on copying and modifying an object. Here is a dummy implementation on the main ideap  precodeimport copy  class Cobject     def initself, kwargs         self.setkwargs      def callself, kwargs         self.setkwargs         returnself      def posself         returncopy.deepcopyself      def setself, kwargs         for keyword, value in kwargs.iteritems             setattrself, keyword, value   first case myobj  Ca12, b33, c55 copied  myobjb77 print varsmyobj, varscopied  gtgtgt a 12, c 55, b 77 a 12, c 55, b 77   second case myobj  Ca12, b33, c55 copied  myobjb77 print varsmyobj, varscopied  gtgtgt a 12, c 55, b 33 a 12, c 55, b 77 codepre  pNow, as you can see, in the first case, the codecallcode method called first, and then later the codeposcode, so the original object is modified and that modified object has been copied. The result I want is in the second case, but in that, first I had to use codecode to separate which method is called first and which is after.p  pSo my question is How can I change the order of calling these methods, probably in the class, without grouping the operators calling with braces on the instancep  pThanks in advancep

First of all, I am only using one machine. The SHA1 fingerprint that I generated was generated on the exact same machine that I am developing on, so there is no issue there. Second, the phone that I am testing on was working just fine prior to my attempt to integrate maps into my application. This is why I suspect that somehow my attempt to use maps is conflicting with my phone.p  pWhat Im wondering is whether the SHA1 fingerprint is somehow not valid for my phone If the fingerprint is only valid for one machine which I believe it is, is my phone considered a emsecond machineem The phone is tethered to the computer via a USB cable and Im running as a virtual device target. Any chance that this is the issuep  pThanks for the replies everybody.p  pRESOLUTION I think that I figured this out. My phone is only running Android 2.3.4 API 10. Since the v2 maps run on a minimum of API 11, my phone was not being recognized for that reason. I had to change the minSdkVersion to 10, and also addp  pp  pto my application node. It seems to work, although I still dont get a map to display. I have the usual Google background and grid. But at least no errors and my app is not functioning again on my phone. Any suggestions are welcome. Thanks againp

Negative 23954 pI recently found that in a 32bit windows application running on Server 2008 R2 64bit, the notification sound produced via a C call to MessageBeep MBICONEXCLAMATION  no longer produces a sound. Sounds in general work and the profile has been loaded with default windows sound settings in the Control Panel. Works fine on Win7 64bit, so I assume its something server specific. Any suggestions for narrowing it downp

Negative 23954 pFirst off, Ive already figured out how to solve this bug, but at this point Im just wondering why my fix works.  The situation I was running into was that I was getting a codeClassCastException, cannot convert LinearLayoutLayoutParams to AbsListViewLayoutParamscode when I tried to do the following simplified for these purposesp  precodemLayout  LinearLayout getLayoutInflater    .inflateR.layout.myheaderlayout,     getListView, false mRootView.addViewmLayout getListView.addHeaderViewmLayout getListView.setAdaptermAdapter codepre  pI eventually broke it down and discovered that the issue was fixed when I removed the call to codemRootView.addViewmLayoutcodep  pMy twofold question is, why is this happening  First, on the conceptual side, why is it that when a header view is already in the layout the whole thing just dies  Is it because that view is effectively trying to be laid out twice once for the header and once for the actual layoutp  pSecondly, why this exception  It seems awfully nondescriptive and it doesnt look like it captures the actual problem at all  Is this a case of a high level issue not being handled because a lower level function will just fail on the results anywayp

Negative 23954 pI have not seeing an satisfactory answer for this yet, so thought Id ask. Are there any best practices for storing UI settings in a filep  pThe scenario is that we have an in house C app that I want to store an array of filefolders in along with other random things flags to use when executing an external command, optional arguments to pass to selectable compare algorithms, etc. Because of the nature of these values, using the built in app.config methods isnt going to work. So is there any best practices when storing semicomplex settings to an setting filep  pCurrently the most complex Im storing will be a list with a single entry needing to store a file name, compare algorithm, and argument text. So its not all simple keyvalue data.p  pIm looking for thoughts onp  ul lilayout ex. if XML, values should be in the attributes vs node.valueli liformat XML, YAML, etcli liframeworksli ul  pThis wont be storing sensitive data, so security isnt a concern.p  pIm currently looking to just use XmlDocument and separate classes for each different collection. But I feel like there should be some existing framework for this already.p  pThank youp

Negative 23954 pHow can I exempt a single row in a DataTables.js table from DataTables builtin filtering, so thta it is always shownp  pstrongBackgroundstrong Im building a table editing component using the jQuerybased a hrefhttpdatatables.net relnofollowDataTables.jsa library. Instead of using dialogs or overlays, I wanted to present editing controls right within the datatable, like thisp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comqJeZe.png altenter image description herep  pThis works like a charm, even with active filters I keep the original, unchanged data in the record while it is being edited, so I can use that data for the codesortcode and codefiltercode modes of codemDataPropcode, and my row stays in place and visible until editing is finished.p  pA bigger problem arises when I add a new row There is no data to use for filtering, so if a filter is active, my row wont be visible. This breaks the workflow where the user searches through the dataset, sees that some record is missing, and without clearing the filter presses the Add button, waiting for an empty row with edit controls to appearp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comUHmi7.png altenter image description herep  pHow can I exempt this special row from DataTables filteringp
Negative 23954 pI am trying to create a code that simulates a MS Paint in java using Jframe. I want to create a textbox like field like MS Paint has,wherein you drag a box and according to your preference you set a size for it. What I do is I draw a rectangle first and then get the dimensions by mouse event listener and pass these values to a function that creates a JtextArea of given size and width. However, I need to extend the Jframe class which creates a new frame on top of the one that already exists. I try to pass my original frame as a parameter to draw upon for the JtextArea which does not work. Is there any way of implementing JtextArea without extending the frame class And If possible any relevant example to draw a textbox which is similar to MS Paint. Please note that I dont want to use the Graphics.drawstring method. Thanx.p

Negative 23954 pSo Im working on adding a feature to out software, and I need to travel from C to C with some data, then return back t C with return data. We have a system in place to make this possible, but it appears only my machine is having issues We use...p  precode    [DllImportuser32.dll, CharSetCharSet.Auto]     public static extern IntPtr SendMessageIntPtr hWnd, int msg, int wParam, ref COPYDATASTRUCT lParam codepre  pIn our method to send the message, there is the following...p  precode        hWndRecipient  hWndRecipient  IntPtr.Zero  new IntPtrAbstractLegacyABELApplication.MainWindowHandle  hWndRecipient         COPYDATASTRUCT dataToSend  new COPYDATASTRUCT         dataToSend.lpData  Marshal.StringToHGlobalAnsimessage         dataToSend.dwData  intmessageType         dataToSend.cbData  GlobalSizedataToSend.lpData         SendMessagehWndRecipient, WMCOPYDATA, hWndSender.ToInt32, ref dataToSend         Marshal.FreeHGlobaldataToSend.lpData codepre  pThis gets the data to the c layer without an issue, I can parse the message in xml, so it is easy to pull apart on the other side. Now when trying to send it back, I am doing the following C...p  precode        SystemRuntimeInteropServicesMarshalFreeHGlobalpCopyDataStructgtlpData                              CString csOutgoingSOME SORT OF MESSAGE TO SEND BACK HERE         pCopyDataStructgtlpData  PVOIDSystemRuntimeInteropServicesMarshalStringToHGlobalAnsicsOutgoing         pCopyDataStructgtcbData  csOutgoing.GetLength codepre  pFor some reason, just on my machine, the first line crashes out, and visual studio gives me a corrupt heap error. If I comment out this line of code, and I ignore the risk of a memory leak for now just to try it out, the new message does not come back when I get back to C, it is still the old message.p  pI have shelved these changes and given them to two other developers, and they were both able to build and run them without an issue.p  pI have tried getting our latest from source control, deleting the debug folder, recopying the DLLs into there, clean, build, nothing seems to change anything for me, I still run into the same issues.p  pAnyone have some insight for me, getting really frustrated, and searches are coming up emptyp  pstrongEDITstrong It appears to be something wrong with my machine. If I build the projects in question and attempt to run the code outside of visual studio, it will crash, but if my coworker builds the same shelf set, he can run it in and out of visual studio. I had him send me his builds of the files that have changes, and mine still crashes with his files...p  pstrongEDIT2strong So After endless trying, trouble shooting, we were unable to find a resolution. Building the same shelf set on coworkers machine, he could run it without an issue, both in debug, and just running the EXE. If he sent me his build, running on my system, it would crash. Had to find another work around, as we cannot give this to customers and risk this issue with one of them.p

Negative 23954 pIm currently testing some databases to my application. The main functionality is data aggregation similar to this guy here a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions2818493dataaggregationmongodbvsmysqlData aggregation mongodb vs mysqla.p  pIm facing the same problem. Ive created a sample test data. No joins on the mysql side, its a single innodb table. Its  a 1,6 milion rows data set and Im doing a sum and a count on the full table, without any filter, so I can compare the performance of the aggregation engine of each one. All data fits in memory in both cases. In both cases, there is no write load.p  pWith MySQL 5.5.340ubuntu0.12.04.1 Im getting results always around 2.03 and 2.10 seconds.

If I do the same filtering on indexed fields on MongoDB, the result time drops only to around 3.7 seconds again processing half the dataset, which I confirmed with an explain on the match criteria.p  pMy conclusion is that 1 My documents are extremely bad designed truly can be, or 2 The MongoDB aggregation framework realy does not fit my needs.p  pThe questions are what can I do in terms of especific mongoDB configurations, document modeling, etc to make Mongos results faster Is this a case where MongoDB is not suited top  pMy table and documento schemasp  p eventsnormal p  precodeCREATE TABLE eventsnormal    origem varchar35 DEFAULT NULL,   destino varchar35 DEFAULT NULL,   qtd int11 DEFAULT NULL,   KEY idxorides origem,destino  ENGINEInnoDB DEFAULT CHARSETlatin1        id  ObjectId52adc3b444ae460f2b84c272,     data           origem  GRU,         destino  CGH,         qtdResultados  10       codepre  pThe indexed and filtered fields when mentioned are origem and destino.p  precodeselect sqlnocache origem, destino, sumqtd, count1 from eventsnormal group by origem, destino select sqlnocache origem, destino, sumqtd, count1 from eventsnormal where origemGRU group by origem, destino  db.events.aggregate group          id origem data.origem, destino data.destino,         total sum data.qtdResultados ,         qtd sum 1         db.events.aggregate match data.origemGRU   , group          id origem data.origem, destino data.destino,         total sum data.qtdResultados ,         qtd sum 1         codepre  pThanksp

Negative 23954 pFolks, Anyone know whathow I can include the appropriate header in order to pick up timespecaddsafe for a Linux C application Or maybe which library to link to in order to extern to timespecaddsafe My environment is kernel version 3.11.014generic within Ubuntu 13.10 Saucy Salamander, and I am already linking my application with lrt.p  pNote that my unfruitful investigations have indicated that timespecaddsafe is coming from time.h, which in my environment is usrsrclinuxheaders3.11.013includelinuxtime.h  Also, note that my application is already including the standard time.h usrincludetime.h for struct timespec and other time definitions. Further, I observe that the kernel has its own time.h of course lacking the declaration for timespecaddsafe in usrincludelinuxtime.h. So, an extension of my question is, what are the differencescaveats between these inlude directoriesp  precodeusrinclude                         standard headers usrincludelinux                   kernel headers usrsrclinuxheadersxxxinclude   what exactly is this whenhow to use codepre  pThanks in advance for any answers.p

Negative 23954 pIm writing a program that download data from a database, and when I was using the codeonPostExecutecodemethod for elaborate data everything works fine. Because I needed this data in the class that calls the AsynkTask class, I used the method codenew AsynkTaskClass.execute.getcode and it worked. Ultimately I implemented an Interface instead of the code.getcode method and the program crashes. When I debug it, it crashes in a line of the method codeupdateJSONDatacode, called in codedoInBackgroundcode, and the strange part is that in that method I didnt changed a line when I implemented interfaces.

Negative 23954 pI have a situation where so far I have not been able to find an answer. Im working on an app that uses a codePopupWindowcode in two different fragments. Each of the two fragments uses two popupwindows. So there are 4 popupwindows total. There is one view that is used for all the popupwindows. That view has an up pointing arrow that needs to point at the button that was clicked to open the popupwindow, no matter where the button may be. I have tried some different combinations of codegetLocationOnScreencode, codegetXcode, codegetLeftcode, codesetXcode and codesetYcode. It is my understanding that codegetLocationInWindowcode is the only one that deals with the location of a view based on the devices screen size. The other 4 all get and set values based on the views parent. Since the button that was clicked to open the popupwindow and the view used to show the contents in the popupwindow have different parents, getXcode,codegetLeftcode,codesetXcodeandcodesetY have resulted in setting the arrows location at a different position for each button.p  pWhat I need, but have yet to find, is a way to set the position arrow image in the popupwindow based on the x and y coordinates I get from codegetLocationOnScreencode. But there is no codesetLocationOnScreencode.p  pSo I need a way to calculate the arrows position so that it sets under the button clicked, no matter where the button is or what the buttons parents are. Im sure there is a way to calculate it, Im just not sure how.p  pCan anyone please help me out with thisp

Negative 23954 pIve implemented handsontable in MVC .Net 4 using razer views, and although the paste functionality works beautifully on localhost both in release and debug mode, it fails once deployed. p  pIt fails silently no console output but if you double click to edit a specific cell, you can paste all the data into that cell, but it doesnt work when trying to paste a table from excel into handsontable.

Negative 23954 pI am trying to take advantage of COW and fork as many child processes as the Linux system memory allows. I would start the parent process until the forking part at which point the process is using a certain amount of memory, then fork one child at a time until fork returns ENOMEM error. In that case, I would wait for any child to finish before forking a new one. Child processes will not allocate any new memory but just work. But this does not work, all my processes were killed by the Linux system without any memory error.p  pWhat is the best way to do itp

Negative 23954 pWere porting Isis2 isis2.codeplex.com to make better use of Infiniband verbs and have our code running.  However, IB is oriented around an asynchronous receive model in which you post a bunch of receive buffers and then, as receives complete, you process the received data.   p  pPolling is slow if I use a blocking wait for, say, 2ms, I might delay as long as 2ms before seeing the IB data.  So thats a solution, but a poor one.  What I really want is a way to wait until an IB completion record is finalized and then to have my thread wake up instantly on Windows this is easy... on Linux it isnt as natural.

Negative 23954 pIm trying to build a bluetooh service through bluez on Linux. According to that tutorial [httppeople.csail.mit.edualbertbluezintrox604.html], it is necessary to connect to the local SDP server in order to register the service. But sdpconnect BDADDRANY, BDADDRLOCAL, SDPRETRYIFBUSY is returning NULL here and all the services related to bluetooth are running without any problem on my Fedora, apparently. Whenever I try to get information about the SDP local server through the command sdptool browse local, I get the following message Failed to connect to SDP server on FFFFFF000000 Connection refused. Some users say it is necessary to get sdpd running in order to use sdpconnect and here there is no package with binary called sdpd, but I think sdpd is now part of bluetoothd on Fedora, so a sdp server was supposed to be running when sdpconnect tried to connect. Why sdpconnect is not workingp

Negative 23954 pI recently discovered the subtypesupertype method in relational database design and therefore this question is this a correct design mixed with subtypesupertype design method p  pBefore I have addressed codepersonscode and codeorganisationscode as two distinct types. I understand that its a better method to have codepartycode a supertype of codepeoplecode and codeorganisationcode. Now, having that settled, adding codeadressescode and codeadditionaladdressescode both apply for codeorganisationscode as well as for codepersonscode, thus connecting them to the supertype codepartiescode.p  pFurthermore, different groups of people I need to keep records of, like codeemployeescode, codeprojectcontactscode and codesuppliercontactscode. These are all distinct types of codepersonscode, within a codepartycode. Is this a correct way of joining the table with codepersonscode to accomplish this goal Same goes for codesupplierscode and codedebtorscode, linked to the codeorganisationcode table, since codesuppliercode and codedebtorscode are always codeorganisationscode.p  pI believe this is a good way of design but I might miss out something with the primary and foreign keys, especially when looking at codeSupplierContactscode. There is a foreign key of codepartyidcode which should refer to a codepersoncode, and also a foreign key of codesupplieridcode, but this codesupplieridcode also refers to a certain codepartyidcode in its own table. Wont this be a ridiculously hard work to be able to query information out of this table and is this design even a proper onep  pMy main concern is the fact that many tables need to refer to a person strongRstrong an organisation, and instead of having two foreign keys everywhere, leaving one NULL at all times since I store a record of either a codepersoncode strongORstrong an codeorganisationcode, now I only have one foreign key codepartyidcode. p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comlPgSR.png altenter image description herep

Negative 23954 precodeabstract class Foo      public virtual int Id  get set    class Bar Foo      public string Text  get set    class Bar2 Foo      public object Value  get set   codepre  pI am using a 3rd party control that takes a List and displays the contents of the list. It looks at the type of the first object in the List and assumes that all the following items are of the same type. This means that the List I provide must either be all Bar instances or all Bar2 instances, because if it contains a mix of Bar and Bar2 then the control will throw an error when it tries to reflectively access a property on the wrong type whether that type contains the property or not.p  pMy team lead has directed me along the path of creating a dynamic proxy. I understand that a dynamic proxy could resolve attempts to access unknown properties at runtime and provide default values, but what I dont see is how an existing 3rd party control like the one we already have in place could figure out what properties are available.p  pThe idea my team lead has is that the dynamic proxy could aggregate the properties on Bar and Bar2 so that the 3rd party control would see in this example both the Text and the Value properties, but the proxy would just return null for either property if its being accessed on the class that doesnt contain it. While this sounds great in theory, I cant make the existing 3rd party control call some special GetAllTheAvailableProperties method that I create. It is, of course, going to just use reflection to figure out what the properties are.p  pI know there are several dynamic proxy libraries out there. Would any of them help with this problem, or is there a way I could implement a dynamic object in such a way that I could make it return a custom list of properties when a 3rd party control reflectively queries for available propertiesp  pThe answer seems to be an obvious no, but I just want to make sure. Im afraid my team lead may be trying to put a square peg into a round hole here, but nonetheless if theres a way that I could implement a solution the way he has envisioned and make him feel like a genius in the process then that would really be ideal.p

I tested by using GLuint as well but that didnt do anything.p  pNext, Ive noted that if I use less than the size of my indices vector being returned from the sphere I can get it to work but it has to be about 16th of the size and of course only about 16th of my spheres triangles are drawn.p  pIve looked through the rest of my code as well to see if Im writing past an array or anything and quite simply its only in the openGL code where Im doing anything with arrays and pointers. p  pBecause Im able to remove the index array and see it working, Im convinced that it has something to do with this but I cannot work it out.p  pOh and finally, the VertexData structure looks like thisp  precodestruct VertexData      GLdouble position[4]     GLfloat color[3]     GLfloat normal[3]     GLfloat tcoords[2]  codepre  h1strongMassive Editstrongh1  pIve since removed all of my C encapsulation and produced this code which gives me the same error.

Negative 23954 pI have a website that is up and running since many years almost 10 by now, and hosted by a third party that provided the MySQL database and connection ID and password I can not change.p  pTo manage changes, I used an old version of EasyPHP codeApache 1.3.27  MySQL 4.0.15  PHP 4.3.3code, configured to exactly match the online server version.p  pOn the development environment, the MySQL user was set up with codeUser  IDcode as provided by hosting company, codeHost  , Password  pwdcode provided by hosting company, codeALL PRIVILEGES and Grant  Yescode.p  pAs expected after so many years, the hosting company announced the migration to newer versions of PHP and MySQL, and to be able to prepare this, I installed a recent version of EasyPHP codeApache 2.4.7  MySQL 5.6.15  PHP 5.4.24code.p  pIn this new version, I created the MySQL user with PhpMyAdmin same settings as above, no errors, and set up the same VirtualHosts as before, but none of my scripts are able to connect to the database, returning the classic errorp  precodeWarning mysqlconnect Access denied for user usernamelocalhost Using password YES codepre  ul liNote in the codemysqlconnectcode function, the correct hostname was used, and not codelocalhostcode as mentioned in the message errorli ul  pOther PHP code is executed correctly, but not very usefull without database connections. I tried to delete the password, and could connect. Also with coderootlocalhost and no passwordcode, the connection is made.

Negative 23954 pI have an dynamically defined array of unsigned 8 bit integersp  precodeconst uint8t data codepre  pThis contains a bytestream, and is reinterpreted as various data types. I can reinterpret a position emnem in this data stream as a fundamental type emtypeem byp  precodetype value   type ampdata[n] codepre  pThis works fine for all data types using the Visual Studio Compiler under Windows, however when compiling under Linux using gcc, this creates a SIGBUS error when emtypeem is a float the dereferenced location is within the range of the data array. Further investigation shows that it is the pointer dereferencing that is causing this error. I have solved this by using memcpy, but would like to know why this causes a problem in the first place seeing as the address that is referenced is valid. Would a reinterpretcast be more suitable, and if so, whyp  pEDITp  pI did not mention that the Linux system has an ARM architecture. MSalters has pointed out below that there may be more stringent pointer alignment requirements for difference configurations. A short research shows that while the above is valid on x86 architectures although not allowed by C  C standards, unaligned pointer dereferencing on ARM will cause a bus error.p

Negative 23954 pI know isolated scope and read some resources about Angular. Now I stuck with a problem suppose I have very deep directivesp  precodeA wraps B wraps C wraps D wraps E X wraps Y wraps D wraps E codepre  pA, B, C, D, E, X, Y are directives. D and E need some information of something which are passed to their isolated scopes, I call this info is codeinfo code. This codeinfocode belongs to A or X. So if I need to use codeinfocode in D and E, I have to pass it in paths codeA gt B gt C gt D gt Ecode or codeX gt Y gt D gt Ecode.

Negative 23954 pI have a sql table that contains a list of affiliations where Entity A owns Entity B, Entity B owns Entity C, etc...  I dont have any sql text to include here because Im not sure fundamentally where to start.  I believe that joining the table to itself multiple times will not give the desired results because it would exclude certain affiliations.p  pWhat I would like to do is group them with some value for those entities that are affiliated to each other I am agnostic as to what value is used for the grouping.  This is probably best explained with the following example.p  pSimplifying my problem, I have the following two columns in my table. The number at the beginning is informational and just represents the record number in order to help with my description below.p  precode1 A  B 2 Z  B 3 Y  B 4 B  C 5 B  D 6 D  E 7 F  G codepre  pSo, A amp B are considered affiliated.  This also means that because B shows up in records 2,3,4 and 5, that Z, Y, C, and D are also affiliated with A amp B, thusp  blockquote   pA, B, C, D, Y, and Z are all affiliated.p blockquote  pI also want to go one step further, and see that RE 5 since B amp D are affiliated, that RE6 B and E should also be affiliated.  Thus the full affiliation list would look something likep  blockquote   pA, B, C, D, bEb, Y, and Zp blockquote  pSince F amp G only show up in their affiliation to each other, they would not be part of the larger affiliation I just described.  Therefore, I would want my expected results to be something likep  precodeEntity  Grouping A  Group1 B  Group1 C  Group1 D  Group1 E  Group1 Y  Group1 Z  Group1 F  Group2 G  Group2 codepre  pI have done my best to explain this, so my apologies in advance for any omission of details or confusingincomplete explanations.p  pThanks in advance for any assistancebr Best,br Robbyp

Negative 23954 pVBA novice and first time poster here.  Sorry if I make any newbie mistakes.p  pIm a teacher and Im trying to make a Jeopardy game in Powerpoint.  Im trying to tackle the Daily Double wagering.  I want a slide that has the wager in a textbox, and can be adjusted by using either of TWO spinbuttons.  This is basically a COARSE and FINE adjustment.  I have the logic worked out, but I cant seem to change the .Value properties of the spinbuttons using VBA.

Invalid property value.  At first I thought this was a Data Type mismatch, so I tried using various CInt and CStr commands to try and find a match, to no avail.  Other experiments trying to set the .Value of a spinbutton have all failed.  I tried using the .ControlFormat object, but I suspect that only works for Excel, not PPT.  Any insight you all have would be appreciated.  If you dont want to address my specific problem, general advice about how to set the value of a spin button with VBA in powerpoint would be helpful, too.  Thanksp

Negative 23954 pstrongIm working in Xamarin C but Java solutions are fine.strongp  pI have a custom parent view with a single child view. The parent has a fixed size and position, and the child is supposed to emexpandem into view where the user taps the parent. The emexpandem animation is a simple fade in and scale which should pivot around the centre of the child.p  pThe result Im currently seeing is that the child always begins the animation at the upperleft corner of the parent and appears to translate to the point the user tapped while scaling and fading properly. This leads me to think that somehow the animation pivot is being interfered with.p  pdelHow can I move the child element and ensure the animation applied to it still pivots around the local centre point, and what exactly is causing this behaviour Im currently seeingdelp  pstrongEdit Ive discovered that the root cause of this is that the animation scales the x and y coordinates of the child as well as its width and height, hence when the scale is 0 the child appears at the origin of the parent element, and when the scale is 1 it appears in the correct position. My new question now is What method can I use to position the child absolutely in the parent without it being affected by scalingstrongp  pThanks.p  h2Parent View Classh2  precodepublic class Parent RelativeLayout    private RelativeLayout child   private Animation      animation   private LayoutParams   layoutParams    public ParentContext context, IAttributeSet attrs      basecontext, attrs        layoutParams  new RelativeLayout.LayoutParams64, 64      child  new RelativeLayoutcontext     child.LayoutParameters  layoutParams     child.SetBackgroundColorColor.Red     child.Visibility  ViewStates.Invisible     this.AddViewchild      animation  AnimationUtils.LoadAnimationcontext, Resource.Animation.Expand     animation.AnimationEnd  OnAnimationEnd      this.Touch  OnTouch       private void OnTouchobject sender, View.TouchEventArgs e         position the top left of the child view such that      the center point lies over the touch point     var x  e.Event.GetX  child.Width  2     var y  e.Event.GetY  child.Height  2     child.SetXx     child.SetYy      child.StartAnimationanimation     child.Visibility  ViewStates.Visible     codepre  h2Expand Animation Resourceh2  precodeltset xmlnsandroidhttpschemas.android.comapkresandroid     androidinterpolatorandroidanimdecelerateinterpolator     androidshareInterpolatortrue     androidduration500 gt   ltscale     androidfromXScale0     androidfromYScale0     androidpivotX50     androidpivotY50     androidtoXScale1     androidtoYScale1 gt   ltscalegt   ltalpha     androidfromAlpha0     androidtoAlpha1 gt ltsetgt codepre

Negative 23954 pIm struggling with how to architect an upvote flow using Rails amp jQuery, such that the upvote happens instantly as far as the end user is concerned.p  pSo first, to define upvote, I mean like you would do on reddit, where clicking an uparrow registers a vote for a record, and increments a counter a thumbsup on YouTube is another example.p  pIm using Rails 3.2, jQuery, and MySQL for the db. p  pRight now my flow is this p  ol lipIn the html.erb template, the upvote element has a code.jsremoteupvotecode class which binds it to a click using jQueryp  pcodebody.onclick, .jsremoteupvote, functione    e.preventDefault   e.stopPropagation   this  e.currentTarget   .ajax     type this.datamethod  post  POST  GET,     url this.dataurl    codepli lipThe codedataurlcode goes to my UpvotesController toggle action, which creates the upvote record, and takes care of some other misc. things.pli liThe toggle.js.erb template then contains the javascript code that adds an code.activecode class on the upvote element, and increments the counter. li ol  pThe problem is that no matter how much I try to lean out the toggle action in the controller, it consumes some time application wide beforefilters, tracking, stuff like that. This leads to an upvote not feeling instantaneous to the end user, which I feel makes for a bad UX when we are used to upvotes happening instantly on reddit.p  pAm I thinking about this the right way Or should I increment the counter and set the code.activecode css class right away embeforeem the request is passed on to Rails That feels wrong to me, since the controller could throw an exception  basically it feels like the js is dumb and will just show the user an instant upvote no matter what happens on the backend. p  pWould that be a bad pattern to adopt Thanksp

Negative 23954 pSuppose I have a list of objects of a C class.

When an element is added to the list, the 2d array should grow in two directions, and when an element is deleted, the tablearray should shrink in two directions. p  pThe two dimensional array as declared in the above code will obviously not work for this. Rather, I am wondering if the SimpleRoute class could somehow abserve the ObservableCollection points, and internally maintain the table of distance data.p  pLater I wish to also be able to store the data from the 2d arraytable  or from the class behindaround it  in an XML through serialization and be able to load it again through deserialization. The relation to the list of SimplePoints should be maintained. Lastly, the data ie. the distances in the automatically adjusting table should editable by the user. I will create the GUI using WPF.p  pI am wondering what is the best approach for this in C.NET, but find it hard to think of something elegant. Searching hasent yielded a lot of results, though I may be looking in the wrong place.p  pMaybe there is some easy solution I am relatively newto .NET programming.p

Ideally Id have the api controllers constructor take in an IStorageService as a parameter, which seems more intuitiveconsistent with the field that actually needs to be set.p

Negative 23954 pWhen I create an ArrayList object and add other objects to it, printing out the ArrayList object will print out the memory references of the objects inside. However, if I add String to the ArrayList object, it will not print out the memory references of the String but rather the actual String value. String is also an object of a class right, so why does it not print out the String memory referencep

Negative 23954 pI am developing a simple web game with my friends. I have integrated facebook login using the javascript sdk provided by FB. Basically, the first page of the web game is main.html, in which I added successfully a Facebook button using the code provided by Facebook p  precodeltscriptgt   This is called with the results from from FB.getLoginStatus.   function statusChangeCallbackresponse   console.logstatusChangeCallback console.logresponse  The response object is returned with a status field that lets the  app know the current login status of the person.  Full docs on the response object can be found in the documentation  for FB.getLoginStatus. if response.status  connected     Logged into your app and Facebook.   window.location.href  mode.html  else if response.status  notauthorized     The person is logged into Facebook, but not your app.   document.getElementByIdstatus.innerHTML  Please log       into this app.  else     The person is not logged into Facebook, so were not sure if    they are logged into this app or not.   document.getElementByIdstatus.innerHTML  Please log       into Facebook.     This function is called when someone finishes with the Login  Button.  See the onlogin handler attached to it in the sample  code below. function checkLoginState    FB.getLoginStatusfunctionresponse    statusChangeCallbackresponse    window.fbAsyncInit  function  FB.init appId       xxx, cookie      true,   enable cookies to allow the server to access                       the session xfbml       true,   parse social plugins on this page version     v2.3  use version 2.3    Now that weve initialized the JavaScript SDK, we call   FB.getLoginStatus.  This function gets the state of the  person visiting this page and can return one of three states to  the callback you provide.  They can be   1. Logged into your app connected  2. Logged into Facebook, but not your app notauthorized  3. Not logged into Facebook and cant tell if they are logged into     your app or not.   These three cases are handled in the callback function.

Negative 23954 pHi I am learning D3 and working on this cluster radial tree. I am stuck at the zooming and panning characteristics of the radial tree. When I am trying to zoom in, the tree goes to the 0,0 coordinate of the window and doesnt stay at the center of the window. I was wondering if anyone working on a similar project would like to shed some light on how to keep the tree at the center of the screen while zooming and panning. Thanksp

still gives me the same problem.p  pCouple of things I am facing problems with.  1 [SOLVED] My virtual scroll is not working. I played around with height, width and shrinkToFit too. But it still does not seem to work. The only thing happening when setting scrolltrue is that the paging gets disabled. p  p2 [SOLVED] Sortabletrue does not work. I have included the necessary css and js files and sortable still does not work.p  p3 [SOLVED] Also gridResize is not working. I do get the different cursor for changing the size but upon trying to change the size, it does not seem to work.p  pOnly thing wrong I can think of is including too many css and js files.p  pAny help would be appreciated on this. Thanks.p

Negative 23954 pIm using codeVolleycode library for my Android project. Here is what Im trying to do I have a login screen in my app, from where Ill take user details and send it to the server through codeJSONcode request, which in response gives the verification status. Then immediately Ill make another codeJSONcode request to server to fetch other user details and save it to local DB using codegreenDaocode ORM. After the details are saved to DB, ill navigate user to next activity and display the fetched details from local DB. But, as soon as I navigate to next activity in codeonResponsecode method, its not showing up the details, meaning data fetched from server is not currently saved in DB. Is it because codeVolleycode is doing the things in background and its not completed yet I know that codeVolleycode does its job on a separate codethreadcode in background and there is no need to use codeAsyncTaskcode for that, but codeonPostExecutecode can guarantee the task of saving to DB is completed and its ok to navigate to next codeactivitycode.br If you didnt get my problem, here is my

Negative 23954 pI have a Java application program that when I run it with my IDE Netbeans works fine.

The JScrollPane change to indertemine mode when the programs runs, but it freezes in the middle.

Negative 23954 pworking with Doctrine on Symfony 2.6 is there a way to detect a transaction rollback on entities that have been persistedp  pstrongmy original problemstrong I create new entities which represent files on the filesystem.

Negative 23954 pI have a website for a college that tracks student information and serves it up to faculty advisors, most of which is confidential.  Many features in this site involve passing a students ID number to the controller.  Because student ID numbers are confidential I am curious if I can avoid having the students ID appear in the URL string as a parameter.  Here is what I have investigated so farp  pRather than passing a students ID via GET I could POST the ID number. This would work fine, but then I am confused on how I could make use of RESTful route helper methods, when the router expects a GET request and I am sending a POST request.  Is it possible to customize around thisp  pA second idea which I fear might be a bit unelegant is to store a hash in session data where some arbitrary number served to the user is the key to that students ID number. That arbitrary number appears in the URL string rather than the id number.p  pThe other alternative I can think of is to not use restful resources at all. This is completely doable, but I want to see if there are any other options.p  pOr is there anything Im not thinking of very possible.p  pThanks,p

Negative 23954 pstrongContextstrongbr I am newbie at JavaFX, but Im trying to build an application which one of its basic feature is to show the user all folders in certain directory and automatically update the view when there are new folders or folders deleted in that directory. These folders can be considered as objects in a ListView for example and the user should be able to interact with them.  I want to build that application using MVC architecture.p  pstrongWhat Ive done so farstrongbr So I have a view fxml, a controller class and my model which handles my app logic.

Negative 23954 pId like to know if its possible to override the application exception handler class in Laravel 5 without extending it to another class.p  pMaybe a better way of saying it is that Id like it so that not codeAppExceptionsHandlercode will be called on an exception but one of my own handlers.p  pThanks in advance.p

Negative 23954 pI have a fairly simple application that takes a data file with about 500k lines of data in it, parses the data, organizes it and then inserts it into an Azure Table. There are about 2000 of these files and I need the process to work smoothly as I load all of the data.p  pI am using WindowsAzure.Storage v5.0.2 for inserting the data and Microsoft.tpl.dataflow v4.4.24 for parallelization. Each file is completely processed and all tasks finalized before I move onto the next file. I am also disposing of all objects I can and setting everything else to Null at the end of each file load.p  pDespite trying to be as careful as possible the RAM usage goes up steadily until it crashes the process. When it starts it jumps up to 1 GB of RAM used and steadily climbs until the process crashes somewhere above 9GB of RAM consumed. Note  this is targeting x64 on a reasonably large computer. Garbage collection is happening on a regular basis, but it doesnt seem to affect the memory problem.p  pAt this point I am completely confused about where the memory leak is coming from and dont have any idea about how to diagnose the problem. p

We managed to Integrate successfully by converting the Cordova app into binaries with the help of cocoapods and integrated it into IOS native app, the app functionality is working fine.p  pIn IOS native app we have more than one webviews.p  pstrongIssuestrong  In Cordova app sometimes we are loosing the data which is saved using window.localStorage this issue is not consistent but happens 2or3 out of 10 tries . p  pAbove issue Occurs only in the Integrated version of app Cordova  Native and not in stand alone version of Cordova app.p  pWe had the same kind of issue in integrated version Android native  Cordova android we managed to fix this issue by overriding the windows.localstorage using addJavascriptInterface p  pstrongQuestionsstrong  1 Have anyone experienced the loss of localstorage value.  2 Do we have such option ie addJavascriptInterface  for IOS as well if so can you please explain how or can you suggest some other better option to commute between Cordova webview to the native layerp  pstrongNotestrong This commute from Cordova webview to native IOS should be synchronous strongnotstrong asyn because I need to override the windows.localstorage  Used cordova version 3.6.3p  pThanks in advancep

Negative 23954 pI was updating a projects code from a 1998 version of zlib to a 2013 version of zlib.  One thing that seemed to change is that there used to be a usecrc flag on the uncompress function, which appeared to have gone missingp  precodeint ZEXPORT uncompress dest, destLen, source, sourceLen, usecrc     Bytef dest     uLongf destLen     const Bytef source     uLong sourceLen     int usecrc  lt vanished  codepre  pemstrongUPDATEstrong as pointed out by Joe, this is likely a a hrefhttpsgithub.comrebolrebolblob25033f897b2bd466068d7663563cd3ff64740b94srccoreuzlib.cL2063 relnofollowthirdparty modificationa.  Title updated accordingly.  The rest of the question is still applicable, as in, how should I best do this with todays stock zlib.emp  pIn the code Im studying, uncompress is being called by something that deconstructs the binary format of a .zip and passes in a payload of data.  The code had been passing the crc flag in as 1.  If the flag was not used, it would get a ZDATAERROR 3.  A zlib with no usecrc flag gets ZDATAERROR just as if the flag had been false.p  pIn experiments, I found that very small files worked without usecrc.  Then that the small counting files crossed over to notworking between code12345678901234code and code123456789012345code.  Reason was thats the first file which was deflated instead of stored uncompressed emat what zip called a savings of 6em p  pIn floundering with options to get zlib to accept it, I tried many things.  That included trying the a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions1838699howcanidecompressagzipstreamwithzlib16  MAXWBITSa.  Nothing seemed to process the payload out of strongzip test.zip test.txtstrong the way the old code had.p  pIf I was willing to subtract one out of my destination size, I seemed to be able to suppress the erring check...at the loss of one byte.  Heres the simple test program with the minimal zip payload hardcodedp  precodeinclude ltstdio.hgt include zlib.h  int mainint argc, char argv[]      char compressed[]   0x78, 0x9C, 0x33, 0x34, 0x32, 0x36, 0x31, 0x35, 0x33,         0xB7, 0xB0, 0x34, 0x30, 0x04, 0xB1, 0xB8, 0x00, 0x31, 0x30, 0xB1, 0x30,         0x10, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00   last 4 bytes are size 16      char uncompressed[16  1]  account for null terminator     int ret zstream strm      memsetuncompressed, X, 16     uncompressed[16]  0      strm.zalloc  strm.zfree  strm.opaque  ZNULL     strm.totalout  0     strm.availin  25     strm.nextin  compressed      ret  inflateInit2ampstrm, MAXWBITS   16   it is ZOK      strm.availout  15  16 gives error 3 incorrect header check      strm.nextout  uncompressed     ret  inflateampstrm, ZNOFLUSH      if ret   ZSTREAMEND  ZOK   doesnt finish...          printfinflate error d sn, ret, strm.msg         return 2           inflateEndampstrm     printfsuccessful inflation sn, uncompressed     return 0  codepre  pThe output isp  blockquote   psuccessful inflation 123456789012345Xp blockquote  pShowing the data is getting uncompressed, but we need all 16 bytes.  emTheres a newline in there from the file that should be received.em  16  MAXWBITS cant even get that.p  pAny ideas whats going wrong  No permutation of settings seems to get there without errors.p
