Negative 43745 pSummary for the impatientp  pWhat I want to know is what you want to have in a new gui language. About the short answers mentioning codeyourfavoriteonecode I assume you mean that, such a language should look like codeyourfavoriteonecode. These are not helpful. Resist the temptation.p  pIm thinking on the user friendliness of XML based languages such as XHTML or HTML, although not XML they are very similar, XUL, MXML and others others in this context means that, I am aware of the existence of other languages and their implementations alternative to their original ones, and the purpose of the mentioning only these languages by name is, to give an idea of what I am talking about and I dont feel like mentioning any others and also, I see no point in trying to make a comprehensive list anyway.. I have some opinions about what features should such a language havep  ol liThe language should be human writable such that, an average developer should be able to code a good amount without constantly referring which tags have which properties, what is allowed inside what. XHTMLHTML is the best one in this regard.li liThere should be good collection of controls builtin for common tasks. XHTMLHTML just sucks here.li liIt should be able to be styled with csslike language with respect to functionality. It should be easy to separate concerns about the structure and eyecandy. Layout algorithm of this combined whole should be simple and intuitive. Why the hell float removes the element from the layout Why there is not a layoutnotincluded or something similar insteadli ol  pI know that I dont even mention very important design considerations like interaction with rendering engine and other general purpose languages, data binding, strict XML compliance ability to define new tags without namespaces but these are the points that I would like to ask what you consider important for such a languagep

Negative 43745 pIm familiar with the the date and time classes in the JDK and their associated formatting methods. I may be blind, but I cannot find an equivalent set of classes for processing time intervals. For example, I would like to display the number of days for a given long value of milliseconds. I realize that the method to do these conversions is quite simple, however when you factor in internationalization and localization support this becomes less trivial. p  pIm surprised that the JDK is missing support for interval processing. However, databases such as a hrefhttpwww.postgresql.orgdocs8.1interactivefunctionsdatetime.htmlPostgresqla support it.p  pBasically what Im looking for in the JDK if Im too blind to see it or in a third party library is the following functionalityp  ul liTime calculation methods.

Negative 43745 pWhat is the best practice when dealing with Errors within a server applicationp  pIn particular, how do you think an application should handle errors like codeOutOfMemoryErrorcodep  pIm particularly interested in Java applications running within Tomcat, but I think that is a more general problem.p  phr p  pemThe reason Im asking is because I am reviewing a web application that frequently throws OOME, but usually it just logs them and then proceeds with execution. That results, obviously, in more OOMEs.emp  pemWhile that is certainly bad practice, in my opinion, Im not entirely sure that stopping the Server would be the best solution.emp
Negative 43745 pI have 60 Opaque form. And when the user changes the color of the form, sometimes depending on the chosen color, they cannot see the text on the form anymore because it tooclosely resembles the color of the form.

Negative 43745 pIm extracting task notes from MS Project using VBA and want to create a MS Word .DOC file and also copy those texts into EXCEL.p  pIf you use the Notes property of the Task objects you only get 255 characters and formatting will not not be retained. In order to keep formatting you can convert the .MPP file into .MPD and extract the notes. These notes have been stored using rtf see PJDB.HTM look for sub getRtf. This way I can extract all notes and write them into a .rtf file. If I open that file containing multiple notes [i verified] using MS Word I ONLY see the first note and it has been formatted well. Info I gathered from other sites learns only ONE rtf text in a file will be handled and it is NOT trivial to join several rtf texts.p  pSo my question is does anyone know how to combine several rtf lines into ONE rtf text.p  pI prefer answers using VBA.p  pOf course, if anyone knows how to extract notes from MS Project and create a .DOC file preserving formats its ok as well p

Negative 43745 pIm writing a plugin for another program which uses the native program to open a series of files to extract some data from. One problem I am having is the process takes a long time and I want to keep the user interface from hanging. Plus I also want to give the user the ability to cancel the process before it completes. In the past Ive used a background worker for this type of thing, but in this case I dont think a BackgroundWorker will work.p  pTo create a plugin through the API I am using one can create a custom command by inheriting from an IAPICommand interface. This interface includes an ExecuteApplication app method. The class is then instantiated and the Execute method is called by the program when the user evokes the custom command in the program. p  pThe Execute method is passed a reference to the current Application object when it is called, and it is this application object that is used to open the files to extract data from. However, the application instance is not able to open a document when requested by a thread other the the original Execute thread.p  pSo typically the UI would exist on the main thread, and the time consuming data extraction would be performed on a secondary thread. However, in this case the data extraction must be performed on the main thread, and I need to create a secondary thread for the UI.p  pHeres a stripped down version of the code.p  precodeclass MyCommandIAPICommand      public void ExecuteApplication app  method from IAPICommand              Thread threadTwo new ThreadShowFormMethod         threadTwo.Start           public void ProcessWidgetWidget w, Application app               uses an App to work some magic on C         app must be called from the original thread that called ExecuteCommand           method to open custom form on a seperatethread     public void ShowFormMethod            MyForm form  new MyForm       form.ShowDialog         codepre  pHere is a flow chart that shows how I emthinkem this should ultimately work.p  pimg srchttpdl.dropbox.comu113068SOMLibThreadingDiagram.jpg altalt textp  ol liDoes this diagram make any sense, and if so am I even taking the correct approach to solve this problemli liOnce the main thread starts the UI thread I want it to wait for the user to either select widgets to process, or end the command by closing the form the red figures on the diagram.

Negative 43745 pI just created an image gallery at a hrefhttpnulightbox.appspot.com relnofollowhttpnulightbox.appspot.coma, a google app engine. I tested this website with firefox 3.5 in Windows XP and Ubuntu Linux. If you open the website and click on the circular blue arrowed button,  you will notice how jaggy not smooth the animation is. p  pThe weird thing is when I open the HTML page in my local box,not through google app engine, the animation is very very smooth.p  pFrom what I understand is that a browser will cachedownload an HTML page, its javascript, and any related style sheet to the user local box when they view a website. Based on this notion, there should not be any server side processing for my image gallery. All the processing should be done at the client side user browser locally in their box. p  pSo I dont really understand why the animation runs smoothly when I run the HTML page locally, but there is so much lag when I view it through google app engine.p  pCheers.p
Negative 43745 pI have many processes reading a file stored on a network share. Originally I was only able to have one process read the file, all the others would throw exceptions. I implemented the following code to deal with thatp  precodeusing StreamReader fileStreamReader  new StreamReaderFile.Openpath, FileMode.Open, FileAccess.Read, FileShare.Read     content  fileStreamReader.ReadToEnd  codepre  pThis let multiple processes read the same file, however it still seems to have issues, because sometimes multiple processes still cant access the file. Yet I can go back later when the file isnt in use and open it just fine. Right now I have some retry behavior with random delays implemented that so far, seem to help. It seems a little quirky to me to do it this way, so what would be a better methodp  pThis is the weird part, the exception Im getting is not from file IO at all, its from a library called CommStudio. In short, I dump the file to a string, i modify it slightly, dump it into a memory stream, and ship it off over ymodem on rs232. The exception is telling me the remote system has canceled. The device getting the data reports that there was a transmission error, which usually means that an incompleteempty file was received.p  pNormally I would blame the library on this, but it works flawlessly at desktesting and when there is only one process accessing the file. The only thing that really seems to be consistent is that it is likely to fail when multiple processes are accessing a file.p

Negative 43745 pIve got several different classes in my code utilising identical methods  resulting in a lot of duplicated lines  and I recently found out about adding Categories which promises an effective solution to the problem. To give one of the smaller examples, my previous methods were typically called in the traditional way like thisp  precodeifthisNum[self valueInTextFieldctr]  0     ... do stuff here...   intvalueInTextFieldinttagNum      NSTextField field  [[prizeWindow contentView] viewWithTagtagNum]     int value  [field intValue]      return value  codepre  pI deleted the above method and added the Categoryp  precodeimplementation NSTextFieldGetFieldValue  intvalueInTextField      NSTextField field  [[[self window] contentView] viewWithTagtagNum]  DOESNT LIKE THIS     return [self intValue]  end codepre  pHowever, it doesnt like me asking it to go find the textField itself using [[self window] contentView], so the only way I can get it to work is to obviously delete the offending line and pass something like p  precodeif[[[[self window]contentView]viewWithTagctr] valueInTextField]  0 codepre  pIm sure you can see what Im trying to achieve here. Is there any way I can get a Category to identify the required field as hinted at above  i.e. without physically passing it myself Thanks in advance p
Negative 43745 pSo Im working on rewriting a program for a professor, and I have some questions related to the ModelViewController pattern.  The program is called GraphViewer and is used to design and view graphs as in Graph Theory, not Statistics.  So far I have planned the structure thusp  ul liModels ul liVertexModel  Has id, location, color, and a collection of edges it is coincident toli liEdgeModel  Has the two vertices it spans, weight, color, and a couple other thingsli liGraphModel  Primarily, but not just, a collection of vertices and a collection of edgesli ulli liViews ul liVertexView  Paints its vertex, and has its own propertiesli liEdgeView  Paints its edge, and also has some of its own propertiesli liGraphView  Basically a JPanel that has a collection of vertex and edge views, when it gets a paint command, it also iterates through each collection of views and issues a paint command to themli ulli liControllers ul liGraphController  Takes care of interpreting user gestures for adding vertices, edges, etc. and updates the model.li ulli ul  pNow the first question I have is related to this plan Should each model have a vieweven though only the graphmodel is a JComponent  Now part of me says yesbecause each vertex and edge might be drawn differently.  But another part of me screams no to the kindof parallellist structure of a graphview having collections of views that correspond to models in the collections of the graphviews graphmodel boy thats complicated. And somehow, I have to work in that the whole graphview must repaint if a vertex or edge model changes.  I suppose the answer to this is also related to whether each model gets a controller.  Am I just approaching this wrongp  pSomewhat tied to the answer of the first question is my second how will I know to notify the graphview if a vertexmodel is added to the graphmodels collection  If a whole new collection is set, itll notify the view when it enters the setEdges method.  But what if I have to write getEdges.add...  Now the graphview needs to be notified of an update, but setEdges was never called...p  pThanks a bunch, as you can tell Im kinda new to design patternsp

Negative 43745 placking a fellow programmer to talk over the right approach for my problem, I decided to ask you. What is your preferred approach of mapping dictionary tables to a model in MVC paradigm, regardless of the MVC framework  environment you are usingp  pMy problem is I have a couple of database tables that only serve as dictionaries and are related to other tables as foreign keys. A good example would be a table coderequestcode having a codestatusidcode where statuses are kept in a separate codestatuscode table. p  pNow, the latter table needs to be mapped to a model on the codeside of the application. I can eitherp  ol li Define all the statuses as constants so they can be referenced in the code without poking those dreaded magic numbers here and there. However, any change to the dictionary databaseside would require a code modification.brbr  li liOmit the status table at all and just define meaningful constant to be used across the code. Pros one place to rule them all. Cons all changes require diving into the code, now the database features magic numbers not really being foreign keys BRBR li liTry to translate statuses into the model automagically, adding a field like constname to the statuses table and them creating the constants on the fly while loading the model. This one seems to have the most sense for me. li ol  pWould you mind to share your usual approach to this issuep  pBest, Bartekp

IE NamedFunction called anonymous function 2111, which called anonymous function 2105.  NamedFunction is one declared through the normal codefunction NamedFunction ... endfunctioncode syntax the others were declared using code like codefunction dict.func ... endfunctioncode.p  pSo obviously Id like to find out which function has number 2105.p  pAssuming that its still in scope, its empossibleem to find out what Dictionary entry references it by dumping all of the dictionary variables that might contain that reference.  This is sort of awkward and its difficult to be systematic about it, though I guess I could code up a function to search through all of the loaded dictionaries for a reference to that function, watching out for circular references.  Although to be really thorough, it would have to search not only scriptlocal and global dictionaries, but bufferlocal dictionaries as well is there a way to access another buffers local variablesp  pAnyway Im wondering if its possible to dump the source code for the anonymous function instead.

Negative 43745 pI need to implement a Single Sign On process for a site.  Ill refer to Site A as the site with the Sign on screen and site B as the site that needs to Auto sign on.  The two sites are on different domains and I do not have any control over site A.  But I need to suggest ideas for the process.p  pAfter some reading I have this suggestion.  Site A passes a ticket in the query string to site b.  Something like SiteB.aspxTicketguid.  This ticket must be a one time valid value that will be managed by Site A.  My site Site B will pass the Ticket back to site A in the form of a web service call.  The response from this call if the ticket is valid will contain an account ID that I can use to auto log in.  p  pDoes this seem an acceptable solution  Site B will be under HTTPS.  Would passing the Ticket in the query string be secure or would the Ticket be best passed as an additional header  Would the ticket still need to be encrypted if under httpsp

Negative 43745 pA coworker of mine is taking an emIntroduction to Object Oriented Programmingem class and was asked a discussion question by his professorp  blockquote   pstrongWhy are many developers opposed to using the protected modifer onwithin classesstrongp blockquote  pWhen the question was brought up at lunch, my coworkers and I couldnt think of reasons why someone might be emopposedem to using the codeprotectedcode modifier on a class.  Setting the premise of the question aside which assumes that many developers are in fact opposed to the codeprotectedcode modifier are they, we tried to figure out why.p  pPersonally, the only times that Ive used the codeprotectedcode access modifier on a class is when Ive written code that I might want to supplement in a test environment.  For example, I might write a base class with no debugging information and then create a new class for testing, inheriting from the base class and overwriting its methods to add in debug output code beforeafter the base method calls.  I suppose I could just as easily use a design that involves interfaces and dependency injection to accomplish the same goal, but my only experience with codeprotectedcode has been for testing purposes.  In this case, the only reason to avoid codeprotectedcode is because you can accomplish the same thing in better ways.p  pWhy might developers be opposed to using the codeprotectedcode modifier in their OOP designp  pemNOTE Because the professor is asking a general OOP question not specific to any one language, Im not sure if answers might be weighted differently because of different implementations of codeprotectedcode in C, Java, etc..emp

Negative 43745 pSorry to bother, but I am in a bit of a pickle and I was wondering if anyone here could give me a hand. p  pI am currently designing a game in which enemies appear on the left side of the screen out of boundaries and move to the right.  I have used a number of codes this is using Sparrow Framework and pretty much the number of enemies increases as you beat them.  i.e. lvl 1 1 enemy, lvl 2 2 enemies, lvl3 3 enemies, etc...p  pI am having some trouble though with producing enemies.  I have them appearing  on 1 of 5 set paths path numbers in NSMutableArray, selected by a random number generator, however they often appear on the same path, 1 on top of the other.p  pTo produce the enemies, i am running a number of methods addEnemy  produces the enemies animations which then travel from left to right. onTouchEnemy  if i touch the enemy, they die.  activates drawEnemies drawEnemies  calls addEnemy a number of times equal to your lvl. coded asp  precodeforint i  0 i lt level i   [self performSelectorselectoraddEnemy withObjectnil afterDelay3.0]  codepre  pIs there a way to program so that there is a delay between activating the produce enemies method  I tried this afterDelay, but for some reason the program just ignores the 3 second delay and just produces enemies all in 1 go.  This is rather irritating since i would like them to appear in a more orderly fashion.p  pI thank anyone willing to give me a hand with this.  Sjkato.p

After adding a service reference and presentation layer on the left side in the datasources tab all shown all the tables from the database. This is great.p  pThen I used a datagridview and bound his DataSource to WCF with bindingsource and finally the wizard to order columns etc. This worked fine.p  pThe next try was to make a web site with the functionality itself. Despite the fact that I added a WCF service reference, datasources are not displayed, therefore it is not possible to use the wizard for quick changes and all the stuff must be coded This work is difficult and needs a lot of code to serve with basic operations like insert, update, delete. But if I add a reference to the Data Access Layer and add in the web.config a connection string, then I can use the wizard. But then, access to datasource DAL does not take place through WCF.p  pI found out that in Asp.net Dynamic Data web site has a basis for insert, update and delete done.

Negative 43745 pWe have an class responsible for converting internal units to display units. So if our display units are m and internal units are mm it would divide the internal units by a conversionFactor of 1000. The user can add entities into the system at a varying x,y,z coordinates. We have an odd occurrence where a user is inputting units at 1000 mm so the display is showing 1m. the input is consistently 1000 mm but every now and again the division of 10001000 seems to be throwing up .9999999m instead of 1m. so in our grid we have 1m,1m,1m,1m,0.9999m,1m,1m etc. Sometimes the .9999m never appears some times it is straight away sometimes it is occurs after 20 to 100 inputs.

For now, PasswordChanged is a nullable bit field.p  pI want to change all instances of it to a nonnullable bit field with a default value of 0 and set any NULL values currently in the table data to 1 yes, I dont want them set to the default of 0.p  pI can probably do the update of the NULL setting and the corresponding update of the already existing database values separately, but my primary question is, how can I loop through all the databases on a server, look for the bvcUser table not all DBs on the server have it and if it exists, alter the PasswordChanged fieldp

Negative 43745 pThis has been bugging me for a while and have yet to find an acceptable answer.  Assuming a class which is either a subclass or implements an interface why would I use the Parent class or Interface as the Type i.e.p  precodeList list  new ArrayList Vehicle car  new car codepre  pIn terms of the ArrayList this now only gives me access to the List methods. If I have a method that takes a List as a parameter then I can pass either a List or an ArrayList to it as the ArrayList IS A List.  Obviously within the method I can only use the List methods but I cant see a reason to declare its type as List.  As far as I can see it just restricts me to the methods Im allow to use elsewhere in the code.p  pA scenario where List list  new ArrayList is better than ArrayList list  new ArrayList would be much appreciated.p

Negative 43745 pIve been reading about CSRF and XSS vulnerabilities for a few days now, and trying to come up with a solution thats 1 easy to implement and use, 2 uses Javascript to do a lot of heavy lifting, and 3 makes it virtually impossible to perform a CSRF attack against.p  pI havent seen a solution like the one Im about to describe. Im hoping this doesnt mean that its leaky.p  pIve come up with the following solution, based on my knowledge of AJAX and JS. This code assumes the user has passed through a login screen, and a session variable has been set on the server strongandstrong in a cookie, with the same values. p  pIts easier to paste the code in and document it, rather than explain what its doing. This code would be run in the page the user sees immediately after logging inp  precodeltscriptgt  this is the constructor function Controller    the following 2 variables are private, and inaccessible via JS calls      var secretToken  this holds the session token, but cannot be read by the browser      returns the session token from the server     var x  new ajaxObjectAJAXretrievesessioncookie.lasso      x.callback  functionresponseText, responseStatus       secretToken  responseText         this is a private function, again inaccessible via JS calls      function getCookie       x.update         the following 2 functions are publicly accessible      just a test function to ensure that secretToken is invisible     this.tell  function       alertsecretToken           privileged function that calls a private function, to load the token into a private variable     this.initialize  function       getCookie        E  new Controller E.initialize  ltscriptgt codepre  pThe variable codesecretTokencode cant be read by the user, as its a private member variable of the controller object. p  pIn coderetrievesessioncookie.lassocode, Im checking for a valid session, and matching the session variable with the browsers cookie. If both these conditions are met, the session variable is returned in plain text, where its set as codesecretTokencode in the object codeEcode. By doublechecking to see if the cookie matches the session token, I would hope that it would be impossible obtain the session token via CSRF, as it cant forge a cookie. Typing in AJAXretrievesessioncookie.lasso would return nothing, unless it was typed in by the user while in a valid session, and from the users computer only.p  pAlso, now that my controller has local access to the session token, I could burn in the session token with every AJAX request, so I dont even have to think about it passing a token anymore, each time an AJAX file is requested. All the AJAX objects and requests would be initialized as private members in the controller objects constructor, so nobody could access  modify the callback functions to disclose the session token. p  pPassing the session token with every AJAX call would protect every other AJAX file, as they would all perform the same check for the cookie matching the session token before returning any data. And, in my programming, there would be one less variable to worry about.p  pIf I were to move ahead with a controller implemented this way, would there be ANY way for the token to be accessed  exploited, either by the user or a malicious coder via CSRFp

Some code that has been working for over a year has now stopped working in Chrome 12.0.742.122, but works in the other big browsers including fellow WebKit stablemate Safari 5.0.5.

Negative 43745 pI have an interesting but frustraring problem. I have an application which uses the full screen this is meant to simulate a thirdparty fullscreen POS application.p  pMy application displays a sequence of modeless dialog boxes on top of the full screen application. It shows one, hides it, then shows the next, hides it etc. After the 3rd show, the Windows taskbar appears about 1 second later. I cant figure out why. p  pIve stripped my code right back to see if its something Im doing in my OnNcActivate handler which I use to draw my skinned window but I dont think it is as the problem appears to be timing related. Ive tried running Spy as well as dumping messages in m WindowProc myself and I still cant see anything odd that would give me any clues.p  pThere are some messages with ID 0x36e in my logs but I cant find out what they are supposed to be. Ive checked various message ID lists and cant find them. They shouldnt be any message IDs of my own since WMUSER doesnt start until 0x400.p  pI know I could get around this problem by autohiding the taskbar but I cant ask our customers to configure their taskbars to autohide to get round my problem.p  pAny ideas why the taskbar would appear in relation to my modeless dialog boxesp  pEDIT I completely stripped out my selfdrawn GUI code and I still have the same problem. I could be wrong but it would seem that when I call ShowWindow SWHIDE first, Windows tries to activate another Window as it says in MSDN. I think in this case its activating the taskbar rather than the POS application. If on the other hand I open my second window before calling ShowWindow SWHIDE  on the second, then it seems to behave itself.p  pCheers Sparkyp

Negative 43745 pI have a web application project in Visual Studio 2010, which has MS Deploy options configured for it.  I can right click the project in Solution Explorer and kickoff Build Deployment Package which tells MSDeploy to create a deployment zip file.  That internally depends on the Build target for the project.  All that works.p  pTrouble is, I cant see how to get the MSDeploy packaging functionality to run as part of the Build target in Visual Studio.  In other words, when I right click the project in Solution Explorer, and click plain old Build, Id like for it to also do the Build Deployment Package.p  pWhy not just click Build Deployment Package, then, you ask  Because I really want the build target of my web application to be a dependency of another project in my solution which is a WIX installer.  In other words, the WIX project has a single dependency which is my web application project.  When I Build the WIX project, VS automatically builds the web application project, but does not build the deployment package.  The WIX installer is using the deployment package as part of its installation process.  In this workflow, either the WIX installer project will fail to build because it cant find files created by MSDeploy bad, or it will find a stale MSDeploy package and use that without complaining really bad.  Sounds redundant to use both MSDeploy and Microsoft Installer, but I am taking queues from a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions925521ismsdeployfriendlyenoughorcanitbewrappedupinanmsifile titlehereherea.  I like the idea of having an MSI that can be chained with other MSIs or incorporated into a GPO application.p  pIf I simply try to manually add Package as a post build event to the web application project by inserting this into the raw csproj XMLp  precodeltTarget NameAfterBuildgt    ltCallTarget TargetsPackage gt ltTargetgt codepre  pthen the plain old build will fail because it will then depend on Package, and apparently the Package target depends on Build.  Which is circular.p  pMaybe what I really, really want is a way to tell the WIX installer project to depend on the output of the Build Deployment Package target, or the Solution to use Build Deployment Package rather than Build in its Project dependency graph.  Any ideas on thatp  pI do not think I want an MSBuild script that must be executed from the commandline, as when performing a scheduled TFS TeamBuild.  Id like to keep this as a VisualStudio task executed by a developer me with a monitor, keyboard and mouse randomly and many times a day.  In fact, I want to say that I dont have access to TFS at all.p

Then I switched to 4.2 and suddenly a class inheritance does not work anymore.p  pI have a class codeTheSuperclasscode and codeTheSubclass  TheSuperclasscode. To simplify testing, I really created them like this. Theres no more code than what you can see herep  precode TheSuperclass.h interface TheSuperclass  NSObject      subclasses must override this method  idreturnSomethingUseful  end codepre  hr  precode TheSuperclass.m import TheSuperclass.h  implementation TheSuperclass  idreturnSomethingUseful      NSLogDude, you have to override returnSomethingUseful     return nil  subclasses override this method     idinit      if self  [super init]              obj  [self returnSomethingUseful]  TEST         NSLogTheSuperclass initialized , obj          return self  end codepre  hr  precode TheSubclass.h import TheSuperclass.h  interface TheSubclass  TheSuperclass     end codepre  hr  precode TheSubclass.h import TheSubclass.h   idreturnSomethingUseful      NSLogCorrect method called     return usefulObject  codepre  hr  precodeTheSubclass foo  [[TheSubclass alloc] init]  remember init of superclass calls the method  Getting the NSLog Dude, you have to override returnSomethingUseful   id bar  [foo returnSomethingUseful]  now call it directly on foo  Getting the NSLog Correct method called codepre  hr  pcodeTheSuperclasscode declares a template method, that is, a method which just does nothing, returns nil and is intended for subclassingp  precode idreturnSomethingUseful      NSLogDude, you have to override returnSomethingUseful     return nil  subclasses override this method  codepre  pIn codeTheSubclasscode, I simply override that template method. And of course I COPIED the implementation out of codeTheSuperclasscode to get it 100 right. No typo. Thats a checked fact. Looks like thisp  precode idreturnSomethingUseful      NSLogCorrect method called     return usefulObject  codepre  pIn the implementation of codeTheSuperclasscode a piece of code calls code[self returnSomethingUseful]code in order to get that object from the template method. Its a great pattern and I have used it a lot. It always worked exactly like this.p  pBut now it appears that even though I create an instance of codeTheSubclasscode, it always calls the WRONG method. The one from TheSuperclass, instead of the one it should which is the overwriding method of coursep  pIve checked that at least 100 times Seriously, it is an instance of codeTheSubclasscode. It calls the init method of codeTheSuperclasscode giving me NSLogs.p  pNow the really strange part When I call that method on my TheSubclass object from outside, it worksp  precodeTheSubclass foo  [[TheSubclass alloc] init] id bar  [foo returnSomethingUseful]  Getting the NSLog Correct method called codepre  pSo to emphasize it When I call code[self returnSomethingUseful]code from within the implementation of TheSuperclass, it calls the WRONG implementation which is the one of the superclass, rather than the overwritten one in the subclass.p  pSo how can I work around this Where does this possibly come from Is this a problem in the runtime, maybe caused by an error in the compilerp
Negative 43745 pI understand from experimentation and other posts Ive found here that if a Page has a specific age restriction, it becomes necessary to use the endusers access token for posting to the Page, as this access token provides the insight necessary to validate the users age.p  pThe problem Im having is that my application a WordPress plugin uses the access tokens acquired through the strongmeaccountsstrong endpoint, but these access tokens dont work when a page has age restrictions. I assume these access tokens represent the permissions and profile of the the strongmestrong used in their acquisition, but this doesnt seem to be the case.p  pI have verified that age restriction is the problem. If I turn off the age restriction on the page, the plugin works perfectly. Turn it back on, and the application fails to post.p  pHow do I remedy thisp

Negative 43745 pWe have a remote Linux machine, accessible over VPN, which has a USB webcam. We want to use this for video conferencing, but we also want to store the stream for archiving.p  pSince the streaming bandwidth is limited, it makes sense to capture the stream on the same machine as the webcam and rsync that across afterthefact, rather than trying to capture the streamed content, which is necessarily going to be poor quality.p  pWere trying to use ffmpeg and ffserver to achieve this, but with little success.

For instance, suppose I have a proof context containing a hypothesis likep  precodeH1  searchtree node a node b ll lr node c rl rr codepre  pand would like to repeatedly invert the hypothesis to obtain a proof context containing the hypothesesp  precodeH1  searchtree node a node b ll lr node c rl rr H2  searchtree node b ll lr H3  searchtree node c rl rr H4  lttree a node b ll lr H5  gttree a node c rl rr H6  lttree b ll H7  gttree b lr H8  lttree c rl H9  gttree c rr codepre  pOf course, obtaining this proof context is easy by repeatedly applying the inversion tactic. However, sometimes inverting a hypothesis will put different hypotheses into different subgoals, and whether to invert each depends on the nature of the information provided by inversion.p  pThe obvious problem is that indiscriminately pattern matching against the proof context will cause nontermination. For instance, the following wont work if one wishes to retain the original hypotheses after inverting themp  precodeLtac invertall    match goal with      [ H1  context [ node a l r ]  goal ] gt invert H1 invertall       gt idtac   end. codepre  pIs there an easy way to do this The obvious solution would be to keep a stack of already inverted hypotheses. Another solution is to only invert hypotheses up to a particular depth, which would remove recursive calls in Ltac.p

Negative 43745 pI created a propertyGrid like.  I used an Item control which uses a viewmodel object. The VM object has the property to be display and its relevant DataTemplates. Everything wosrk fine. My Property grid actually act like the VS property gridp  pMy problem is that every time the use changes the selected object which lead to changes in the property grid its took to much time depends on the amount of the selected object properties. I figured out that the reason for the bad performances is the templates loading and rendering.  so I thought that I may solve this issues by creating real controls for each object, and not just uses templates. Create buttons and text box for each property this will solve the loading time, I hope..p  p1 is there any way to creates real controls in code using data templates 2 is there any other way to improve the performances of my Property gridp  pThe main code for the propGrid is attached to this postp  pThanks, Leonp  pCODEp  precodeltDataTemplate xKeygridItemsControl gt             ltGrid

Negative 43745 pHey there stack overflow enthusiasts.  p  pI am getting this mixed content warning in Internet Explorer. img srchttpi.stack.imgur.comf7M1a.png altThis is the Warning I getp  pIt is annoying some of my end users.  I know that there is a couple of solutions to this problem by browsing stack overflow one browser based and one code based.  I have looked at what might be being requested via http as apposed to https using Fidler and chromes dev tools and everything is being requested via http.p  pHowever, I did notice something strange.  Looking at http I found out that the browser is looking for a specific .gif file and it cant seem to find it.  Upon further investigation, it looks like it was part of a jquery package I downloaded timeentry.js.  The Jquery file is found and it is working.  But that gif file just doesnt look like it is showing up.  I am going to ask another SO question about how to get that timeentry jquery file to work with that gif file.  But my question for  you is, will you still run into a mixed content warning if everyything is attempted to be loaded via https but the browser cant still find certain contentp  pHave you every run into a similar issue and resolved it  Any help with this would be greatp

Negative 43745 pI have a WPF application where Im trying to create a diagnostics panel thats very similar to the Output Window in Visual Studio 2010.

As a result, a very large amount of text gets displayed as new output continues to come in...p  pThe WPF TextBox has a MaxLength property which I leave set to 0. According to the MSDN documentation, When this property is set to 0, the maximum length of the text that can be entered in the control is limited only by available memory.p  pFor the customers that leave this panel up, I hate to just let the text and memory grow uncontrolled...

This solution is lighting fast and Ive never seen a faster way of displaying that many images. The concept is a hrefhttpkaioa.comnode99 relnofollow titlehereherea and deserves a link. Another advantage over CSS sprites is that with jar each image can be individually optimized for size e.g one is optimized to 64 colors, another one to 128, 32...depending on the image and a large spritesheet can not be optimized as it contains a lot of colors.p  pSo, does anyone know of a solution which would be equally fast as jar If using CSS sprites to display content is bad practice  what is good practice which gives the same result The key here is the loading speed of the website with as few HTTP requests as possible.p

Can anyone point me to a good way to accomplish thisp  pa hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions7679454rails3calculatelinetotalswithajaxThis questiona is really similar and I think that answer could work here too, but I cant figure out how to display the time difference correctly since that would have to reference the rails helper method.p
Negative 43745 pI have been working on PHP application built using CodeIgniter framework, which needs to be deployed on client site. I want to protect php code by compiling it before deployment using Phalanger. For testing this Ive created a demo project on CodeIgniter with just one function and controller. Now I just need to protect the controllermethod Ive created on the top of CodeIgniter while leaving rest of CodeIgniter as it is. I have tried several ways and also tried to find how to do it on google, but there isnt any good material on how to use Phalanger. Does any one had any success using Phalanger to obfuscate php code for deployment  Any tutorial or help will be good. Thanksp

Negative 43745 pI have an Android activity with a list. Each item can be clicked and when that happens a new layout is displayed below the text with some buttons.p  pI wanted to set the selected item to the center when clicked, because when the last one is clicked the menu is lost and you need to scroll, which is very confusing.p  pMy code saves the position of the last selected item, so when another one is clicked, it can hide the edit menu for that item. p  pWhen I use setSelection this behavior breaks, it seems like the positions in the listView changes, because that logic doesnt work anymore. All options remain visible, different rows are reacting instead of the one clicked, and if I click a row below the selected one, it throws a NullPointerException. p  pIve tried to do this in many different ways, storing the view instead of the position, using scrollTo instead of setSelection, etc... but it always seems to break.

Negative 43745 pI find myself wishing an interface could be composed of methods that are fulfilled in several classes. If I could do that, I could make an interface for a role that has one function from this class and one function from that class.p  pDoes any language support this Is it possible in the typical JavaCVB.NET style OOp  pFor example I have a function that takes an value object, and saves all the parts into the correct tables. I just made an interface called codeStatsPersistencecode that I inject to a function so I can unit test its behavior, but it is missing a method. I want to be able add a method to that, but that method is on a different class from the first two, so this is obviously not possible.

Negative 43745 pWhen you call codeexpiresfromnowcode on a running timer, the timer is cancelled, and a new timer is called. So the associated handler is called. It is easy to discriminate in the handler between a cancelled and an expired timer.  Yet, I am wondering, if there is a way to discriminate between a expired and a retriggered timer. In both instances the handler is called with errorcode codeoperationabortedcode. Or maybe I missing some details.p  pThe code below generates the following outputp  precode20120415 213228079507 Main Timer1 set to 15 s.     20120415 213228079798 Main Timer1 set to 12 s.     20120415 213228079916 Handler1 Timer 1 was cancelled or retriggered.     20120415 213240079860 Handler1 expired. codepre  pThis suggests that the handler is not able to implement actions for a cancelled handler, because retriggering a timer will call the same handler and thereby execute the same actions. Which is probably not the intended behaviour. p  precodeinclude ltboostasio.hppgt  include ltboostthread.hppgt  include ltboostdatetimeposixtimeposixtime.hppgt include ltboostdatetimeposixtimeposixtimeio.hppgt include ltiostreamgt   using namespace boostposixtime using namespace std  void handler1const boostsystemerrorcode ampec        if ec  boostasioerroroperationaborted              cout ltlt microsecclocklocaltime ltlt  Handler1 Timer was cancelled or retriggered. ltlt endl           else              cout ltlt microsecclocklocaltime ltlt  Handler1 Timer expired. ltlt endl          boostasioioservice ioservice1   void run1        ioservice1.run     int main        timefacet facet  new timefacetYmd HMSf     cout.imbuelocalecout.getloc, facet      boostasiodeadlinetimer timer1ioservice1, seconds15      timer1.asyncwaithandler1      cout ltlt microsecclocklocaltime ltlt  Main Timer1 set to 15 s. ltlt endl       now actually run the timer     boostthread thread1run1      timer1.expiresfromnowseconds12     cout ltlt microsecclocklocaltime ltlt  Main Timer1 set to 12 s. ltlt endl       here the timer is running, but we need to reset the deadline     timer1.asyncwaithandler1      thread1.join    wait for thread1 to terminate    codepre

Negative 43745 pInspired by a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comq10375755201952this questiona, where the poster casually states as fact that codeltobjectgtcode should be used instead of codeltimggtcode to embed images in HTML documents.p  blockquote   pIm developing a web app at the moment, and, being a perfectionist, I try to make it all shiny and compliant with all the standards. As far as I know, the codeltimggtcode tag is to be deprecated in the upcoming standards for xHTML, and as nowadays even IE is able to handle codeltobjectgtcode properly, I wanted to use the codeltobjectgtcode tag for all the images on my sitep blockquote  pIt became clear that the upcoming standards the poster was talking about was the abandoned a hrefhttpwww.w3.orgTRxhtml2XHTML2a spec, which didnt even formally deprecate codeltimggtcode anyway.  Although there were apparently a hrefhttpwww.codingforums.comarchiveindex.phpt77173.htmlrumorsa to that effect.p  pTo the best of my knowledge, Ive not seen anyone in the web development community advocating for the usage of the generalpurpose codeltobjectgtcode tag over the arguably more semantic and definitely more compatible codeltimggtcode tag.p  pIs there a good reason to use codeltobjectgtcode instead of codeltimggtcode  Should codeltobjectgtcode even be used at all in place of codeltimggtcode ndash what might this breakp

Negative 43745 pIm currently brainstorming a financial program that will deal with over time fairly large amounts of data. It will be a cQt gui app.p  pI figure reading all the data into memory at runtime is out of the question because given enough data, it might hog too much memory. p  pIm trying to come up with a way to read into memory only what I need, for example, if I have an account displayed, only the data that is actually being displayed and anything else that is absolutely necessary. That way the memory footprint could remain small even if the data file is 4gb or so.p  pI thought about some sort of searching function that would slowly read the file line by line and find a tag or something identifying the specific data I want, and then load that, but considering this could theoretically happen every time theres a gui update that seems like a terrible way to go.p  pEsentially I want to be able to efficiently locate specific data in a file, read only that into memory, and possibly change it and write it back without reading and writing the whole file everytime. Im not an experienced programmer and my googling for ideas hasnt been very successful.p  pThanks in advance for any ideasp  pEdit I should probably mention I intend to use Qts fancy QDataStream related classes to store the data. In other words the file will likely be binary and not easily searchable line by line like a text file.p

The [1] is the element which I pushed on, but [0] looks like some sort of nullable object.p  pThe vector size is 2 also even though I have only inserted once.p  pLater in my code I will traverse the vector using codevectorname[i]code. Initially I would start with codei0code, does this mean with a vector you should use 1 or some sort of iteratorp
Negative 43745 pI have a function that strips a wav file from a video, then using FileStream I read from the wavefile. The problem is, the read function returns 1 no more bytes to be read prematurely. Its a 20 minute wav file, but only about 17.5 minutes are written. p  pIn this function, I am mixing several wave files into a one large one. The problem is the filestream reader for the large wave file is ending too early. I cant figure out why. p  pHere is my codep  precodepublic void combineWaveFileDataobject status                    ProgressWindow progressWindow  status as ProgressWindow         ExportProgressWindow

I have an RoR app that allows people to cast a vote on an election using a drag and drop interface, using JQuery UIs Sortable. I call each element on the drag and drop list a preference.

I want to save only the positions of the preferences that the user dragged into sortable1.p  pFor the drag and drop, I used JQuery UIs Sortable, and the interface is quite nice. However, I am having problems actually submitting the position of each preference to eventually record it in the database. This is my first web app and I am very new to this.

Negative 43745 pAssuming that my character is falling, and headed toward some sprite platform, and I flag that my character has landed once a collision is detected, what is the best way to reset my characters position  so that he is above the platforms rectangle or so that he is still clipping it  p  pMy concerns are that if my character is above the platforms rectangle, than my function fall will be called because he isnt touching anything, and if my character is clipping the platforms rectangle, than my jump function may be hindered, because it may think hes landed as soon as he takes off.

I have few questions, but if you find anything I didnt ask important for me to start developing this application, please, let me know.p  pI have read about AVRCP profile and Bluetooth device in car supports AVRCP 1.3, which is good enough for me, having in mind controls which can be performed in that protocol version.p  pI read a lot about people saying Apple device can only interact with each other, Apple device cant be connected via Bluetooth to nonApple device, MFi program is obligatory if you want to do that, MFi is not needed, etc. My first question isp  pstrong1Is it even possible to pair iPhone 4, 4S with radio and CD player in car via Bluetooth and control radio stations and music with any iPhone version If yes, what are the limitations for making this kind of successful Bluetooth connectionstrongp  pThere is also very few informations about roles in which iPhone can work. For AVRCP there are two kind of roles controller and target role. By reading this paper a hrefhttpsdeveloper.apple.comhardwaredriversBluetoothDesignGuidelines.pdf relnofollowhttpsdeveloper.apple.comhardwaredriversBluetoothDesignGuidelines.pdfa I didnt find answer to my second questionp  pstrong2 Can iPhone act as a controller and issue all available commands stated in AVRCP 1.3 to target device radio and CD playerstrongp  pI would also like to know about available frameworks for this particular problem. I know there are several of them, but if anyone recognizes the right one for my problem, Id like to knowp  pstrong3 Which framework for interacting with target device should I usestrongp  pFrom developer point of view, I am also interested in available APIs for interacting with connected Bluetooth device. Since I am making my own application and assigning actions to buttons, inside of methods assigned to buttons I need to perform message sending to target device. So my next question isp  pstrong4 Does anyone know how if theres a way to send commands to target device startstoppauseforwardbackward, etc as part of some API provided in XCode, or each message which I attend to send via Bluetooth to target device I need to make according to protocol documentation make entire message header, body, command part, etc by myselfstrongp  pAVRCP was my thought for accomplishing this application. If I am wrong, please let me know.  Bluetooth has different profiles and when message is sent from one device, as far as I understand, profile itself handles message and interprets it and delivers to target device so target device can understand it. I do not understand how a message sent from iPhone to target Bluetooth device is handled from the moment I send it from my ObjectiveC or C code. Thats the main doubt I have and it is related with question 4  strongemdo I need to make raw messages in correct format in order to send AVRCP commands to device or I can use some API which will recognize those messages as AVRCP or any other kind and deliver it to target deviceemstrongp  pThis last question if I suppose there is any kind of positive answer to all previous concerns me the most from developer point of view. So, if anyone had maybe experience with this specific problem, I would appreciate any kind of answer or advice.p  pI am really looking forward to your answers. I hope that constructive and useful discussion will start on this topic and that lots of useful informations will be written.p  pBest regards.p

Negative 43745 pI have a project which has both scala and java code which I am currently managing in eclipse using the scala IDE plugin. At present the directory structure is organized such that some packages have both java and scala code in them. There are scala classes which depend on java classes and there are other java classes which depend on the scala classes. The plugin handles all of this transparently  I believe but Im not 100 sure that the scala compiler compiles both the java and scala code together which is how the cross dependencies are handled. I did find some references to compiling mixed projects using Maven a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions336144buildingascalaappwithmaventhathasjavasourcemixedine.g. here abut the ones I saw talking about separating the java and scala into two separate source trees. Maven attempts to compile the scala code first which fails because of the dependencies on the java code. Likewise, if the java code were compiled first it would also fail as the dependencies go both ways. Is there a way to have Maven compile all the code together like the eclipse plugin Id also like to have the ability to generate an eclipse project without doing too much manual fixup afterwards if possible.p

Negative 43745 pWe are trying to setup continuous integration. Our software suite consists of some 20 C solutions. For some of the projects, unit tests NUnit are already available. We want to automize the build and test process, and get information on breaking changes early.p  pRecently, I tried to do so with Hudson. Some problems could be solved after intensive search thru the web, and some trial and error.p  pNow a bug prevents us from getting ahead our solutions share some components, of course. When a shared component was changed, we do not want the build process to stop after the first failure  we want to know all of the projects which were broken. This cannot be handled by Hudson, also when using the parameterized trigger plugin version 2.4 it coped with starting the next project after the first completed perfectly, and failed after a build failed. Then, even the email notification was not sent, and afterwards, no downstream project is started at all  even in case of a succesful upstream project.p  pWith the quite disappointing experience with Hudson upto now, we think of taking a different system.p  pCan you recommend from your positive experiences a Continuous Integration tool which doesp  ul liintegrate with Subversion both for getting source code and for triggering buildsli listart msbuild e.g. Windows command lineli litrigger further projects, regardless of failures in upstream projects must doli linotify by email when a build failedli listart unit tests with NUnit e.g. command lineli linotify by email when a unit test failedli licooperate with other computers in the buildtest enviroment to deploytest on other systemsli licommunity support is availableli ul  pUpdate I tried Jenkins.

Negative 43745 pShould a class constructor return a subclassp  pThis is mostly a question about OOP style and python style. I have problem where I need to implement a general case solution and, for performance reasons, I need to implement an optimized solution for a specific input type. The input type depends on the user. Currently Ive implemented this by subclassing the general case solution to make the optimized solution.

Negative 43745 pIm posting this thread because I have some difficulties to deal with pictures in Java. I would like to be able to convert a picture into a byte[] array, and then to be able to do the reverse operation, so I can change the RGB of each pixel, then make a new picture. I want to use this solution because setRGB and getRGB of BufferedImage may be too slow for huge pictures correct me if Im wrong.p  pI read some posts here to obtain a byte[] array a hrefhttpstackoverflow.coma9470843such as herea so that each pixel is represented by 3 or 4 cells of the array containing the red, the green and the blue values with the additionnal alpha value, when there are 4 cells, which is quite useful and easy to use for me.

I tried those solutions p  p1 Making a DataBuffer object, then make a SampleModel, to finally create a WritableRaster and then BufferedImage with additionnal ColorModel and Hashtable objects. It didnt work because I apparently dont have all the information I need I have no idea whats the Hashtable for BufferedImage constructor.p  p2 Using a ByteArrayInputStream. This didnt work because the byte[] array expected with ByteArrayInputStream has nothing to do with mine  it represents each byte of the file, and not each component of each pixel with 34 bytes for each pixel...p  pMy question may sound noobish since I saw many threads about how to convert BufferedImage to byte[] but very few about the reverse operation, but I have searched for hours in the Java documentation and some sites such this one without finding a satisfaying answer.

Negative 43745 pCompared to codeAppDomain.GetAssembliescode, codeBuildManager.GetReferencedAssembliescode a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibrarysystem.web.compilation.buildmanager.aspxSystem.Web.Compilation.BuildManagera seems a more reliable way to get the assemblies that are referenced by an ASP.NET application at runtime, since a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibrarysystem.appdomain.getassemblies.aspxAppDomain.GetAssembliesa only gets the assemblies that have emalreadyem been loaded into the execution context of this application domain. p  pIterating through all assemblies is an important tool for dynamically registering types at application startup in your DI container and especially during application startup, chances are that other assemblies are not loaded where not needed yet, and the composition root is the first one that needs them. It is therefore very important to have a reliable method to get the applications referenced assemblies.p  pAlthough codeBuildManager.GetReferencedAssembliescode is a reliable method for ASP.NET applications, Im wondering strongwhat alternatives are available for other types of applicationsstrong, such as desktop applications, windows services and selfhosted WCF servicesp

Negative 43745 pI am looking for a good way to model a move in a board game.  I want to be able to ask a Player what their move is and have them respond, then be able to perform the correct actions on the board based on their move.  The problem is, there are several types of moves, each with its own set of data.  For example, in Scrabble, you can play a word, which should return the word, its position and direction or a set of tiles with positions or whatever, but you can also swap tiles which would involve returning the tiles you want to swap or pass.p  pSimilarly in chess, you normally move a piece, which should return a move with the piece and where it goes, but you could also castle, which involves indicating two pieces and their positions, or a side kingqueen, or some other piece of information besides pieceposition.p  pIm assuming that a Player returning a Move object is the best way to go, but Im open to any other modeling choices or suggestions as well.p  pThanksp

Negative 43745 pI am planning for an android application that needs database. My plan is to use Google Cloud SQL for database, and build APIs using Google App Engine GAE.  I looked into the UserService class provided in the appengine library, developed a simple applcation to authenticate, it redirects users to the google page for login and works fine. If I use this API in an android or any OS application, will the user have to signin every time the application is launched  I havent tried, but I want the user to signin only the first time, will GAE work that way  Just wanted to clarify. Thanksp

Negative 43745 pIm using Unity 3D 3.5 pro.p  pIve got this scene with two cameras in it. One of them is looking at a plane that has a render texture on it. The other is recording the render texture. When the camera thats recording the render texture has a 11 normalized view and height rect, everything is fine. But when Its something different, some weird stuff happens  the render textures image becomes distorted. Ive tried releasing and discarding the render textures contents in an update function, but nothing changes Its totally stopping the project Im working on from being completed. I have pictures here to explain the situation in detail. The reason its a problem is because i need to be able to place non rectangular objects in front of the square and not have their scales appear to be distorted, due to the scale of the plane on which the render texture is being shown not being a square.

Negative 43745 pIm developing computer vision application and I will need Classifier class. This class will be immutable per run of application and it loads the trained data from disk on initialization. I want to ensure that whole program will have access to same trained data and I want to block reloading the from disk once they are loaded.p  pWhat I was considering was to use either static class or singleton.

Negative 43745 pI am working on a multiview telepresence project using an array of kinect cameras.br To improve the visual quality we want to extract the foreground, e.g. the person standing in the middle using the color image, the color image and not the depth image because we want to use the more reliable color image to repair some artefacts in the depth image.p  pThe problem now is that the foreground objects usually 12 persons are standing in front of a huge screen showing another party, which is also moving all the time, of the telepresence system and this screen is visible for some of the kinects. Is it still possible to extract the foreground for these kinects and if so, could you point me in the right directionp  pSome more information regarding the existing systembr we already have a system running that merges the depth maps of all the kinects, but that only gets us so far. There are a lot of issues with the kinect depth sensor, e.g. interference and distance to the sensor. Also the color and depth sensor are slightly shifted, so when you map the color like a texture on a mesh reconstructed using the depth data you sometimes map the floor on the person.p  pAll these issues decrease the overall quality of the depth data, but not the color data, so one could view the color image silhouette as the real one and the depth one as a broken one. But nevertheless the mesh is constructed using the depth data. So improving the depth data equals improving the quality of the system.br Now if you have the silhouette you could try to removemodify incorrect depth values outside of the silhouette andor add missing depth values insidep  pThanks for every hint you can provide.p

The images are loaded from internal memory and are 216220KB big, and I use a layer drawable in order to draw another transparent image on top of them.p  pKeeping an eye on the heap memory occupied by the bitmaps, if I change the orientation of the device, the memory increases of some MB. Causing 23 GC, in a few moments the amount of memory decreases to the initial value. Slowly repeating the process change orientation  23 Force Garbage Collection, the amount of memory increases but then goes back at the same value. This makes me think I am doing it right with Bitmap management in my application.p  pBut if I start rotating repeatedly and quickly the device, I see the amount of memory increasing continuously.... and subsequent GC will only be able to reduce the heap occupation by a little amount of memory in comparison to its rapid growth during fast rotation.p  pIs Android unable to Garbage collecting so fast Why am I able to keep memory usage stable if I slowly rotate and not if I repeatedly rotate faster without forcing GC for a whilep  pAndroid 4.1.2  Samsung Galaxy S3.p  pThe code below is called whenever a png is read from internal storage or downloaded by an AsyncTask from the internet.

After extensive search, I have found that it is possible to do this above task. Some of the questions I have on this p  pa Do we have to install any drivers on the micro controller to communicate with mobile phone for sending AT commands i.e., is it sufficient if we simply code the related AT commands in the microcontroller in C p  pb Many people were using Fbus protocol for this above objective. Is there any other general protocol similar to this which can help for communicating with all mobiles samsung,nokia,sony..p  pI have read extensively in SO also.

Negative 43745 pTrying to do basic Steganography on a PPM Image.p  pI have the basic algorithm completed. Read in the file, check the header starts with P6, get the image width and height, and the pixel data.p  pI need to have a total of four methods ReadPPM, WritePPM, WriteMsg and ReadMsg.p  pI have the ReadImg and WriteImg methods down, but where I am stuck is with my WriteMsg method. This is basic steganography that just writes each bit of the string to the last bit in each byte. The first 8 bytes are suppose to contain the size of the string being hidden, then each byte after that starts the hidden message.p  pMy idea was to create a massive array that holds the binary code for the size of the string, then the binary code of the string itself. Im just trying to figure out how I would take that array and add it to each byte in the image.p  pAny help is much appreciated.

Both numbers above are from two different CPU implementations I made to compare the code. This is not a difference between the GPU and CPU calculations. I appreciate any suggestions.p

Negative 43745 pI have a view which includes two subviews.  I had it working so that only one subview was shown at a time and each subview had a button and when the button was clicked the subview would flip over and the next subview would appear. The problem was that it appeared as though the entire view was flipping. After reading on this site about how to solve the problem I attempted to add the subviews to a container and flip that instead. However now, although my first subview is showing up when I press the button it no longer flip. It doesnt do anything. I put a log statement in the method which flips the subviews, as well as a breakpoint and as far as I can tell it no longer gets called.

Negative 43745 pIve made a simple magnifying glass effect a hrefhttpjsfiddle.net7LExF relnofollowfiddlea. Its a div with the same background as the codeltimggtcode source, that changes its position based on the pointer position while hovering over image. Nothing too complicated. In the Fiddle it works just fine in browsers that support codepointerevents nonecode the rest doesnt make it disappear, but thats not the problem right now.p  pThe problem is that in Chrome it works only when the code is inside codeltiframegtcode, like in that Fiddle. When its not, just like here a hrefhttpfiddle.jshell.net7LExFshow relnofollowFiddlea, the background of magnifying glass moves only after opacity transition is complete. I made it 1,5 second so its easier to notice. Whats also strange is that it partially works when I hover the cursor starting from the top of the image.p  pWhat may be the problem Is there any other solution than putting that code inside iframe I tried to modify the js and it kind of works with codefadeInfadeOutcode with jQuery, but Id rather have it done with opacity transition in CSS in this case.p  pAnd feel free to change the title so it makes more sense p
Negative 43745 pI have problem as following. I use a Titanium Studio, build 3.1.1.201306112235 with SDK 3.1.1 GA on Windows 7.

Furthermore when I try run the same app in Chrome I see the same behaviour. Only in Internet Explorer app works properly version 10. Do you have idea why apps from Titanium dont work properly If you would like to get some more logs just ask.p  pEDIT I provide remote access, and reopen page by Firefox in the same version on my colleagues laptop. Then in here browser everything works well. So i have question which settings, on my browser can freezing titanium application.

Negative 43745 pUsing Android Studio to make an app that uses Google Play Services for maps, I have to include the googleplayservices library and also make sure there are some .jar files and all that jazz. I get this just fine, however, at work we use git for version control. If a different machine pulls down the files for said app from git, and that machine has a different location for the library needed, the user of this second machine has to reconfigure the project to use that machines libraries, and when that user pushes changes to git, the same has to be done for the next user. This makes it difficult, as one can imagine, to collaborate effectively and efficiently with multiple developers on the same project.

However, instead of having to make this change throughout the code, I was wondering if its possible to affect the locale of emjust my applicationem upon startup.p  pI have found an a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibraryb28bx3bh28vvs.10029.aspx relnofollowarticle on MSDNa that says I can achieve this with the following codep  precodeusing System.Threading using System.Globalization Thread.CurrentThread.CurrentCulture  new CultureInfoenUS Thread.CurrentThread.CurrentUICulture  new CultureInfoenUS codepre  pBut it doesnt say whether or not worker threads spawned from the main thread will also inherit the parents culture.p  pI assume this is not the case, as in .NET 4.5 there is apparently a emnewem codeCultureInfo.DefaultThreadCurrentCulturecode property that specifies the culture for all threads in the app domain, but there isnt anything like this in .NET 4.0.p  pCan anyone recommend a nice solution for this locale issuep

Negative 43745 pSo I restructured a central part in my Cocoa application I really had to and I am running into issues since then.p  pQuick outline my application controls the playback of QuickTime movies so that they are in sync with external timecode.p  pThus, external timecode arrives on a CoreMIDI callback thread and gets posted to the application about 25 times per sec. The sync is then checked and adjusted if it needs to be. All this checking and adjusting is done on the main thread.p  pEven if I put all the processing on a background thread it would be a ton of work as Im currently using a lot of GCD blocks and I would need to rewrite a lot of functions so that they can be called from NSThread. So I would like to make sure first if it will solve my problem.p  pstrongThe problemstrongp  pMy Core MIDI callback is always called in time, but the GCD block that is dispatched to the main queue is sometimes blocked for up to 500 ms. Understandable that adjusting the sync does not quite work if that happens. I couldnt find a reason for it, so Im guessing that Im doing something that blocks the main thread.p  pIm familiar with Instruments, but I couldnt find the right mode to see what keeps my messages from being processed in time. p  pI would appreciate if anyone could help. Dont know what I can do about it. Thanks in advancep

Negative 43745 pThis is my first foray into Entity Framework, and I have a working project with EF5 and the repository pattern. I want to do integration testing against a live DB. I made a snapshot of my existing production database and wrote a stored procedure to recreate a fresh snapshot every time I want to run tests. My question is how to I switch my context to this database snapshot when in unit testing mode In my app.config I have both my live and test connection strings as suchp  precodeltconnectionStringsgt   ltadd nameReportingDbContext connectionStringServerLiveServerDatabaseUnifiedReportingUser IdmyuserPasswordmypassTrustedConnectionFalse providerNameSystem.Data.SqlClient gt   ltadd nameTestingDbContext connectionStringServerLiveServerDatabaseUnifiedReportingSnapshotUser IdmyuserPasswordmypassTrustedConnectionFalse providerNameSystem.Data.SqlClient gt ltconnectionStringsgt codepre  pAs it stands now, I have my DbContext with the entities I want to use as followsp  precodepublic class ReportingDbContext  DbContext      public ReportingDbContext  basenameReportingDbContext  as per my app.config                  inventory     public DbSetltComputerEntitygt Computers  get set      public DbSetltNetworkAdapterEntitygt NetworkAdapters  get set       ... plus a whole bunch more  codepre  pWhat I think I need to do is change the basenameReportingDbContext into nameTestingDbContext, but given how I have my RepositoryUnitOfWork setup Im not seeing how I can do so. The issue may be here in my UnitOfWorkp  precodepublic interface IUnitOfWork  IDisposable      void Commit       inventory     IRepositoryltComputerEntitygt Computers  get      IRepositoryltNetworkAdapterEntitygt NetworkAdapters  get       ... plus a bunch more   public class UnitOfWork  IUnitOfWork      private readonly ReportingDbContext dbContext  null      public UnitOfWork              dbContext  new ReportingDbContext           public void Commit              dbContext.SaveChanges            Inventory     public IRepositoryltComputerEntitygt Computers get  return new RepositoryltComputerEntitygtdbContext      public IRepositoryltNetworkAdapterEntitygt NetworkAdapters  get  return new RepositoryltNetworkAdapterEntitygtdbContext        ... lots more  codepre  pThis UnitOfWork has been great is that I can do a bunch of stuff to all my repositories and save it in one shot without having a bunch of contexts floating around to synchronize. It may or may not be relevant to this question, but this is how my UnitOfWork uses the repository. There is only 1 repository class, but it can be fed with any entity type neededp  precodepublic interface IRepositoryltTgt where T  class      IQueryableltTgt GetAll     IQueryableltTgt FindExpressionltFuncltT, boolgtgt predicate     T GetByIdint id     void RemoveT entity     void AddT newEntity   public class RepositoryltTgt  IRepositoryltTgt where T  class      protected DbContext DbContext  get set      protected DbSetltTgt DbSet  get set       public RepositoryDbContext dbContext              if dbContext  null                      throw new ArgumentNullExceptiondbContext                  DbContext  dbContext         DbSet  DbContext.SetltTgt           public IQueryableltTgt GetAll              return DbSet         ... more implementation of the interface, nothing fancy  codepre  pThe endpoint of where this magic is used is inside my WCF service. This is where I want to actually run through an integration test. A particular method in my service initializes a unit of work and uses that do stuff. The UnitOfWork creates a ReportingDbContext when it is newd up, and this ReportingDbContext in turn refers to the connection string of nameReportingDbContext. After much reading, I think the answer is to use an IoC container like Unity or Ninject havent used one before, but Id like to, and Im stuck on how to implement IoC in this situation. Here is an example method that Im using in my WCF service that seems rather hardcoded to the live database connection stringp  precodepublic ComputerDTO GetComputerDetailsstring hostname, string client    dont worry about the return type, its defined elsewhere     using var uoW  new UnitOfWork              var repo  uoW.Computers         var computer  repo.Findx gt x.Hostname  hostname ampamp x.CompanyEntity.Name  client.FirstOrDefault          do stuff       codepre  pId like to keep my connection strings inside my app.config if at all possible and be able to somehow switch to the testing connection string during the [SetUp] part of my NUnit testing of the methods in my WCF service.p

Negative 43745 pIve recently been reading a lot about font icons, and just about every site I see uses the codebeforecode and codeaftercode pseudoelements in combination with the codecontentcode property to insert font icons into the DOM.p  pHowever, I dont see the advantage of using these pseudoelements for font icons. In fact, I feel like there are two big disadvantages to using them codebeforecode and codeaftercode are not supported in IE7 and below, and it can be hard to position content using them.p  pAs such, my question is this Why use codebeforecode and codeaftercode at all to insert font icons into the DOM I was thinking that maybe it has something to do with screen readers, but nowadays, all font icons services like IcoMoon seem to allocate the font icons to code points in the Unicode PUAs Private Use Areas, which from what I hear, are not read aloud by screen readers anyway.p  pTo me, it seems much easier and more crossbrowser compliant to simply add the font icons to the markup using HTML entities like codeampxE000code.p  pTo rephrase the question What are the specific reasons why most people use codebeforecode and codeaftercode for font icons Thank you very much.p

Negative 43745 pI need to track the version history of several entities, to be able to see the state of all its properties at any given point in its history, that includes their many to many relationships. It also has to support changesets. Given the following tablesp  precodeEntityA  Id Name Revision ChangeId  EntityB  Id Name Revision ChangeId  EntityAToEntityBMapping  EntityAId EntityBId ChangeId  ChangeTracking  ChangeId Date User Description codepre  pFor EntityA and EntityB tables I would have a history table with the exact same columns. The data is always modified through an Object Model, so before any change is committed I would create a new ChangeTracking entry and add its Id to any entities being inserted or updated, plus incrementing the Revision. I then have an InsertUpdate trigger on EntityA and EntityB tables, and would copy the previous data into the history table. At any given point you have all the history for an entity in its history table.p  pThe problem comes with many to many mapping tables. I could do the same for the mapping table and have a history table, but I need to be able to say at revision 3, this EntityA had these values for their columns, and these relationships to EntityB. EntityA history table could be joined with the mapping history table by ChangeId, but what happens when only the name of the EntityA is changed At that point the relationship history would be lost, since its a new revision. p  pI can think of three scenarios that need to be supportedp  ol liOnly EntityA is changed, no changes in relationships. li liOnly relationships between EntityA and EntityB change. li liBoth EntityA is changed and its relationships modified.li ol  pFor all these, consistency needs to be maintained and I should always be able to get all properties and all relationships for a given revision of EntityA.p  pDo you know how I can handle history for many to many tables After searching a lot I havent been able to find a satisfactory solution to this problem. By the way, Im using Entity Framework and SQL Server in case its relevant.p  pThanksp

Negative 43745 pI intended to use Eclipse with MinGW. But after all the setup done, I got this strange error. Well its not an error actually. I think its a bug.

It works but like thisp  pSuppose I am running this code p  precodeincludeltstdio.hgt int main      int a, b, c     printfEnter two numbersn     scanfd d, ampa, ampb     c  ab     printfd, c     return 0  codepre  pAfter running the program, the console appears like this img srchttpi.stack.imgur.com774cE.png altenter image description herep  pWhen I run this program first, and it appears to be that the codeprintfcode statements are executing after all the codescanfcode statements are done. Now this problem quickly resolves if one just adds an codefflushstdoutcode after every codeprintfcode. But there should be some solutions in the terms of configuration and setup, adding an codefflushstdoutcode doesnt look very comfortable to me, imagine it in a menu driven program with 10 or more options. So is there anything else I can do about thisp  pI have already tried this.p  blockquote   p   codeProject gt Properties gt RunDebug Settings gtcode Select the .exe and click codeedit gtcode go to option codeEnvironmentcode and select codenewcode and give codeName  PATHcode and codeValue  CMinGWbincode p blockquote  pBut sadly it didnt work.p

Negative 43745 pBackground on this project. It started as a simple homework assignment that required me to store 5 zip codes and their corresponding cities. When a user puts a Zip code in a textbox, a corresponding city is returned, and likewise the opposite can be done. I wrote the code to return these values, but then I decided I wanted to store ALL zip codes and their corresponding Cities in an external .csv, and store those values in arrays and run the code off that because if its worth doing, its worth overdoing To clarify, this is no longer for homework, just to learn more about using external files in C. p  pIn the following code, I have called to open the file successfully, now I just need help in figuring out how to pull the data that is stored in two separate columns one for city, one for zip code and store them in two arrays to be acted upon by the for loop.

Negative 43745 pIm writing a program which combines the RGB pixel values for 3 images, e.g. red pixel of image 1, green pixel of image 2 and blue pixel of image 3 and I want to then create a final image of it. Im using the code below, but this seems to be incrementing x2 and x3 whilst x1 is the same, i.e. not giving the right pixel value for same coordinate for each image. p  precodefor int x  0 x lt image.getWidth x              for int x2  0 x2 lt image2.getWidth x2                  for int x3  0 x3 lt image3.getWidth x3          for int y  0 y lt image.getHeight y             for int y2  0 y2 lt image2.getHeight y2                 for int y3  0 y3 lt image3.getHeight y3  codepre  pSo I was wondering if anyone can tell me how to iterate through each of the 3 images on the same coordinate, so for example read 1, 1 of each image and record the red, green and blue value accordingly. Apologies if it doesnt make complete sense, its a bit hard to explain. I can iterate the values for one image fine but when I add in another, things start to go a bit wrong as obviously its quite a bit more complicated I was thinking it might be easier to create an array and replace the according values in that just not sure how to do that effectively either.p  pThanksp

Negative 43745 pI am looking for a way to call a function when a button is pressed and held for one second. When the button is released another function should be called.p  pI was thinking about an onLongClickedListener but this wont work well for me since the text that is going to be displayed would stay too long or short.

Negative 43745 pI am working with an app which uses codephpActiveRecordcode and mySQL to pull in data from a sensor network and plot it onto a number of flot.js graphs on the client.p  pThere are several timeframes the user can chose between to affect the range of data the graphs display. code2hrs, 24hrs, 3 days and 1 week.codep  pThe sensors post to the database every 60 seconds, so when plotting the graphs, the query pulls in all rows between codenow and DATESUBCURDATE  INTERVAL  DAYcode where  is either 1, 3 or 7 etc.p  pHowever this results in a massive number of rows being returned code60,000  for the full weekcode and is causing huge delays and server errors.p  pI know I can just massively increase the max memory available for queries in the codephp.inicode file, but this is hardly a good solution, and doesnt solve the issue of speed.p  pMy question is, is there a way I can easily select only every second or third row from the required date range depending on the length of the interval the user wishes to viewp  pIn C or Java I would do something like a modulo select to return alternate rows but I cannot think of a way to do this in the current framework.p  pAny ideas would be appreciated. Thanks.p

Negative 43745 pI have a rails app in which students can apply to projects posted by employers.  I have it so a Student hasmany projects, and a Project belongsto Student.

Negative 43745 pIve run into a weird effect that sure looks like a bug in iOS7  but often in the past, when I have thought I found a bug in Apples APIs, it has turned out to be my own misunderstanding.p  pI have a UIDatePicker with datePickerMode  UIDatePickerModeCountDownTimer and minuteInterval  5.  I initialize the duration to 1 hour, and present it to the user, where it appears as a twocolumn picker with hours and minutes.  So far so good.p  pThe user is thinking 20 minutes, and so scrolls the Hour column to 0.  At this point the picker reads 0 hours and 0 minutes, and iOS7 is not cool with that, so it automatically scrolls the minute wheel to 5.  My UIControlEventValueChanged handler gets invoked, and the countDownDuration reads 5 minutes.  Still good.p  pNow the user grabs the minute wheel and drags it to 20.  AND... my UIControlEventValueChanged handler does not get called.  Bad.p  pIf I have some other event in the UI check the date picker at this point, I do see the countDownDuration is set to 20.  But I had no way of knowing that the user changed it, at the moment it was changed.  This is very repeatable it always happens on the first change AFTER the picker refuses to be set to 0 advancing itself to 5 minutes.p  pNote that this is in iOS7 it does not occur in iOS6 perhaps because the picker there is perfectly content to be set to 0 minutes.p  pSo... am I missing something here  Or is this a genuine bug in iOS7  And in the latter case, does anybody know a workaround better than having some timer periodically check the current intervalp

But there is more to this. If i set a break point before first loop and go step by step then this thing does not happen. when codeicode becomes one the cycle ends. and everythings okay. now the method I provided above is called by an ASP.NET MVC Controllers Action which itself is called Asynchronously by ajax call suppose 3 times. and out of this three just one executes correctly other two do the thing I said above if not breakpointed. I think that this problem is caused by ajax call most probably because when I breakpoint it stops other calls from executing. Can anyone suggest anything  p

Negative 43745 pOkay I have some physics objects, and they are all nicely categorized, and my didBeginContact is properly fired, and does what it is supposed to do.  The problem is thisp  pI have two categories of objects, say ball and paddle.... When the ball touches a paddle the ball should explode... simple enough.. The problem lies in that the ball could touch 2 paddles at the same time... So, more than one didBeginContact gets called, and as such more than 1 explosion happens 1 per paddle the ball contacted with.. So the problem I am trying to figure out is, how do I removeignore all subsequent contacts with paddles from being handled if the code has already handled a collision involving the original ball  Removing the SKSpriteNode from parent before starting the explosion does not nullify the other contacts, they still get handled... so how do I tell it.. HEY PHYSICS CONTACTS STUFF... that body is no longer in the picture... so just throw those contacts away and dont worry about themp  pI suppose I could explicitly check that the parent still has the SKSpriteNode available in the contact code before doing the explosion etc, but that seems kludgy at best, though I suppose it would work... Is there anotherbetter way to handle this I have to believe there is.p

Negative 43745 pIm writing a python script to crack a playfair cipher, with only the ciphertext. First i generate about 30100 decryption keys and run them on the ciphertext, ranking each one on its digraph frequencies. To the next generationiteration I copy the ones with the best score. Then they are mutated letters swapped places in the 5x5 grid  and readd to the next iteration, which is ranked again, and so on.p  pIve noticed that the script often finds a local maximum  a key giving a similar distribution, yet not the real deal. I think a solution to the problem would be to introduce more variation to the population of keys by the end of the script, all of them are almost the  same.p  pI tried to implement it by adding to each generation a couple totally random keys but they get eliminated almost immediately.

Negative 43745 pI am working in maintenance windows form app project. Till now project is only in one language.

Negative 43745 pI work for a company that can send out public safety messages. I unfortunately cant give code samples or explain exactly how it works, so this is more of a is this possible type question. p  pIn the case of our app, it is essential to get public safety messages out to people subscribed regardless of time or day. This includes the night, when people turn their phone on silent. If there is a gas explosion and an area needs to be evacuated immediately, or if there is a freak storm and people need to seek shelter, we want to be able to wake them up and get them out of the area and into safety. One incident that keeps coming up in discussion was that train explosion in Lac Megantic, Quebec this past summer. Had the police sent out a message that told everybody in the area to evacuate, some peoples lives may have been spared.p  pSo, is there a way to force an iOS, an Android or a Blackberry device to ring when on silent We are building the the iOS and Android apps in Titanium Studios, with Blackberry being built natively. p  pI have a feeling that Android is yes and iOS is no, but Im just starting to get into app development so I really have no idea.p  pThank youp

Negative 43745 pIs there any possibility to manually switch to  force display of selected layout width on specified device or screen size I mean, I would like to have responsive as usual, but when screen is exactly 1366px wide or maybe is specified useragent it should show 768 SM layout instead of 1280 LG without manually adding a condition to many, many media queries... Maybe there is a way to tell the browser, that its width is different than it measured.p  pAm I even thinking in good direction or it makes no sense Thank youp

Negative 43745 pHere is a very simple test program. When vsync is disabled this program runs at 100FPS and uses up virtually 0 of the CPU. When I enable vsync, I get 60FPS and 25 100 of one core on a 4 core system CPU utilization. This is using a Nvidia GPU. Searching online lead me to the suggestion to disable multithreaded optimization inside of Nvidia control panel. This does decrease the CPU utilization, but only to 10. Furthermore, if I remove the call to sleep after SwapBuffers, I get 25 utilization again even with multithreaded optimization disabled.

Negative 43745 pOn a membership site that I am developing, once the user has logged in, on his profile page there are two simple forms.p  pThe first is diplayed only if the user has his district field NULL in the database. If the district field contains any information, the first form is replaced by a table displaying data from that district. The purpose of the form is for the user to select his district from a list, and update his account so he can read local information from his district. After he hits submit, the district field in the databsase is updated and then he never sees this form again.p  pThe second one is a basic contact form, thru which the user can easily send an email message to the support team if he needs any help. Once the message has been sent, instead of the form, a success message is displayed until the refresh of the page, when the text field comes back to normal and the user can send another message.p  pI have tested them and they both work fine separately, but the error I am encountering is that when a user with NULL in his district field logs in, or whenever his page is refreshed, the second form automatically sends a blank email to the support team, and is allways showing the success message instead of the text input for the message to be written in. I have setup an error when the second form is submitted empty, but despite this, while the first form is showing, with every refresh, a new blank email is being sent...p  pAfter the user has submitted the first form an updated his district, the second form returns to normal and works just fine...  I know that there is a conflict, or I forgot to setup some conditions in the code below. Please be kind, take a look and tell me where do you think the error might be.

Negative 43745 pI am writing a fairly large, multithreaded application, with many differing roles for threads e.g. event processing, metrics, networking. Currently, if there is any inconsistency that cannot be handled, it will manifest itself as an exception. Since theres really no way to recover from some of them, Ive been rethrowing it as a runtime exception of type codeApplicationDeathExceptioncode. p  pAny classes that need to handle shutdown would call it from a catch block for this exception, and then rethrow it in order for it to propagate up the stack.p  pI am considering killing off all other threads in this same manner by calling codeThreadstopThrowablecode upon them. Most are fine with sudden termination, and can catch this exception should there be a need for shutdown logic. They will simply have the exception propagate up the stack, performing shutdown logic whereever needed, and eventually just killing the thread in the end. Are there any hidden dangers that Im missing with this approachp

Negative 43745 pUsing Web API 2 and OWIN hosting with Ninject.  p  pI would like to inject the current IOwinContext into certain services so I can get at the Request to get the principal to do some data filtering. p  pWith Web Hosting I would, in the old days, simply have used HttpContext.Current but that is not an option with OWIN hosting and good riddance. p  pa hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions21703268resolvingiowincontextinmvc5applicationusingautofacThis SO questiona explains how to do it with Autofac. Essentially, you create a Dependency Scope and then, on each request, calls Autofacs Registerinstance to register the current IOwinContext into that dependency scope like sop  precodeapp.Useasync ctx, next gt       this creates a perrequest, disposable scope     using var scope  container.BeginLifetimeScopeb gt               this makes owin context resolvable in the scope         b.RegisterInstancectx.AsltIOwinContextgt                    this makes scope available for downstream frameworks         ctx.SetltILifetimeScopegtidsrvAutofacScope, scope         await next        codepre  pThat is very elegant. With Ninject and the Ninject.Web.WebApi.OwinHosting I already get a named scope for each request so that plumbing is taken care of. However, I havent been able to find any way in ninject to mirror AutoFacs RegisterInstance method The key here is that this binding is only valid within this particular dependency scope.p  pI have read up on the various options around Scope but everything I have found relies on being able to declare constants or ToMethod. What I am looking to do here is to say, okay, I now have a ninject dependency scope and if anyone asks for an IOwinContext from emthisem scope, give them this instance that I already have. p  h3Noteh3  pI do understand that I can get the current context from within my controller and pass it on, but that rather defeats the purpose of what I am trying to do I want my DbContext to understand who the user is so it can filter the data. And, of course, once I can get the IOwinContext I wont actually pass that to the DbContext, rather I will use a ToMethod or similar to extract the ClaimsPrincipal but that is out of scope of this question.p

Negative 43745 pIm making some tests with validation engine, and I find the messages are rendering wrong at the corner on the page, so... is it possible to properly render the messages when you dynamically change the class attributes with jQuery like a revalidation of the form with the class attributes of the input changedp  pstrongUPDATEstrong I tried to use the codevalidatecode action, but its the same thing. Im using 3 tables here with 4 checkboxes each.

The checkboxes names render with a Thymeleaf preprocessing expression, so I thought that maybe that was. I created an alternate version of the minCheckbox that uses alt attribute instead of name, but to no avail. Works well, but the error persists.

Negative 43745 pI have the task of creating a web service that takes requests from multiple clients.

Why Because the first three items are the first ones with those unique indexes.

To save you from this boredom, codecollections.MutableSetcode and friends contain just those implementations.p  pa hrefhttpsdocs.python.org2librarycollections.htmlcollectionsabstractbaseclasses relnofollowThe docsa say the abstract methods arep  blockquote   pcodecontainscode, codeitercode, codelencode, codeaddcode, codediscardcodep blockquote  pand that the mixin methods arep  blockquote   pInherited codeSetcode methods and codeclearcode, codepopcode, coderemovecode, codeiorcode, codeiandcode, codeixorcode, and codeisubcodep blockquote  pAnd, just to be clear that codeupdatecode is not part of the Inherited codeSetcode methods, codeSetcodes mixin methods arep  blockquote   pcodelecode, codeltcode, codeeqcode, codenecode, codegtcode, codegecode, codeandcode, codeorcode, codesubcode, codexorcode, and codeisdisjointcodep blockquote  pHowever, codeSetcode refers to an immutable set, which naturally would not have codeupdatecode.p  pstrongWhy is codeupdatecode not among these methodsstrong I find it surprising  unintuitive even  that codesetcode contains this method, but codecollections.Setcode does not. For example, it causes the followingp  precodeIn [12] myset Out[12] ltms.MySet at 0x7f947819a5d0gt  In [13] s Out[13] set  In [14] isinstancemyset, collections.MutableSet Out[14] True  In [15] isinstances, collections.MutableSet Out[15] True  In [16] s.update Out[16] ltfunction updategt  In [17] myset.update  AttributeError                            Traceback most recent call last ltipythoninput179ed968a9eb18gt in ltmodulegt gt 1 myset.update  AttributeError MySet object has no attribute update codepre  pPerhaps stranger is that codeMutableMappingcode emdoesem bestow an codeupdatecode method, while codeMutableSetcode does not.

Negative 43745 pIm making a command line nodejs tool that automates renaming symbols in Typescript files, using the Typescript language services.p  pYou tell the tool rename all symbols of this type to this symbol. Just like resharper, it will also rename local variables, properties, etc. Since it allows renaming multiple symbols at once, you can also swap two symbol names, without needing an intermediate temporary unique name e.g. rename Foo to Bar and vice vesa.p  pI had to make the private function getSymbolInfoAtPosition in the language service public to make this work, so that I can get PullSymbol information p  pCurrently it only detects exact nametype matches, by calling getNameAndTypeName on the PullSymbol, but I would like to perform structurally compatible matches.p  pIn C, this is easy, since a Type has an IsAssignableFrom method.p  pDoes anyone know how the Typescript compilerasaservice can be used to detect if one PullSymbol is structurally compatible with another PullSymbol p  pThanks a lot, Peter Verswyvelenp

Negative 43745 pOkay. After much effort and annoyance, I have created a rather competent design of a 1pxbordered 1515 grid that displays properly at different zoom levels. However, trying to compensate for minwidth and minheight is a pain. This is necessary because the grid will become disproportionate at 150 zoom as as there does not yet exist a css property like minwidth intrinsic for inlineblock values. And while I can simply specify a default minwidth that I feel will not be crossed, that seems like a bit of hack. I want to do this properly.p  pAs grids are one of the rare instances where I can and actually probably should use tables, I would like to use a table. Yay. If I can get my table to work correctly, Ill simply set minwidth as my preferred table width and height, job done.p  pHowever, I find tables to be annoyingly quirky and quite unpredictable at different zoom levels. Firefox does not always display tablecell widths equally, and even causes weird irregular variations in the borderwidth of some cells. Chrome doesnt seem to keep the table square if I dont define widths on codetdcodes themselves which kind of defeats the purpose of using a table in the first place. Display table has the same sad behavior. And I dont even want to know what the heck IE does. Am I missing somethingp  pI would appreciate some help to create a true table that looks like my following code, yet maintains its shape and gridborder PROPERLY at different codedevicePixelRatioscode and on different browsers.p  precodeltstylegt .squares  borderleft 1px bcafaf solid bordertop 1px bcafaf solid float left   background black  ltstylegt  ltdiv id  board style  display inlineblock border 1px brown solidgtltdivgt ltscript src  jquery1.11.1.min.jsgtltscriptgt ltscriptgt function  for var i0ilt225i   board.append ltdivgt, classsquares, width2.0rem, height  2.0rem, id  xi1        if i150  .squares.eqi.css clear left       code for adding borderright and borderbottom for necessary squares, etc ltscriptgt codepre  pThanks greatlyp  pstrongNotestrong At this point Im using absolute rem values to avoid browser squishing issues on zoom and also if the browser window is too small  although now Ill probably have to use that everywhere. p

Negative 43745 pI have quite a large page with a lot of content, one part of which is a table of prices against dates. Typically the table looks like this img srchttpi.stack.imgur.comdbguM.jpg altenter image description herep  pThe Previous and Next links and the datepicker enable the user to show a different range of dates in the table. However using simple html forms and phpmysql, the whole page refreshes every time and that looks pretty messy. I want to use jQuery and Ajax to refresh just the table.p  pTo that end I have put the table in a separate file using PHP include. That separate file called calendarinner.php uses a variable called startdate to do the necessary mysql queries to get all the data for the table. Now I just need to understand how to feed the included file with a new value of startdate and then refresh that file. This is where I am groping in the dark with jQuery.p  pStarting with just the datepicker, I have started to write the jQuery script, but unsurprisingly it doesnt work.p  precodeStartDateCal.onsubmit, functiong       g.preventDefault  prevent form from submitting     var startdate  StartDate.val     .ajax          type post,         url calendarinner.php,         data data,         dataType text       codepre  pPlease be gentle with me. My occasional success with jQuery has been limited to occasions when I have been able to copy someone elses piece of code virtually verbatim. Thanks.p  pEDIT Ive modified my script based on the advice from Raslett but I havent reached the solution yet.p  precodeStartDateCal.onsubmit, functiong       g.preventDefault  prevent form from submitting     .ajax          type post,         url calendarinner.php,         data StartDateCal.serialize,         success functionresult              getresult.htmlresult                codepre  pNow the full page doesnt refresh, only the calendarinner.php file, so thats a little success. I think the issue now is what to do with the result. Using the code above and placingp  precodeltdiv idgetresultgtltdivgt codepre  pat the start of calendarinner.php inserts my 404 Error page into the overall page. Changing htmlresult to textresult writes the whole code of the 404 Error page into the same space. What I dont know is what is being generated by the script that causes the server to invoke the 404 Error page.p  pSECOND EDIT I got rid of the 404 Error. I was calling the url wrong. Now that is corrected, I am getting closer but the remaining stuff to do is pretty mysterious. The script now writes the first row of the table twice once with a start date of 1 Jan and the second time with the original start date. So now all I have to do is 1. Persuade the first version of the table row to use the new start date 2. Stop the second version of the table row from showing 3. Pass the start date to the next part of the table where the prices are calculated and written Phew Not easy.p  pTHIRD EDIT As Rasclatt said, the jQuery is now working and I just need to sort out the calendarinner.php file. For simplicity, Im just putting the first few lines below. The key variable is startdate, which then drives everything else. I need the jQuery to change the value of startdate.p  pFOURTH EDIT Updated the code of calendarinner.php and showed more of it. See below.p  precodeltdiv idgetresultgtltdivgt ltscriptgt document.readyfunction  Submit change of date in price tab without refreshing page StartDateCal.onsubmit, functiong           g.preventDefault  prevent form from submitting         .ajax              type post,             url includescalendarinner.php,             data StartDateCal.serialize,             success functionresult                  console.logresult,                 getresult.htmlresult                             ltscriptgt ltphp ifissetPOST[StartDate] ampamp emptyPOST[StartDate]              startdate     htmlentitiesPOST[StartDate], ENTQUOTES             firstdate     dateYmd,startdate             lastdate      dateYmd,strtotime11 days,strtotimefirstdate               database insertion of above variables         else             firstdate  dateYmd,startdate lastdate  dateYmd,strtotime11 days,strtotimefirstdate           Select database requireonce..ConnectionsMySQL.php mysqlselectdbdatabaseMySQL, MySQL mysqlsetcharsetutf8   Create a temporary table querytemptable  CREATE TEMPORARY TABLE temptable dt DATE NOT NULL result  mysqlqueryquerytemptable, MySQL or diemysqlerror  Now loop through the date range and fill the temporary table thisdate  firstdate while strtotimethisdate lt strtotimelastdate queryinsertdate  INSERT INTO temptable dt VALUES thisdate result2  mysqlqueryqueryinsertdate, MySQL or diemysqlerror thisdate  dateYmd, strtotime1 day, strtotimethisdate    MySQL query to get priceid or blank for all dates in range querytariff  SELECT temptable.dt, lhdates.tariffid FROM temptable LEFT JOIN lhdates ON temptable.dt  lhdates.dt AND hid  hid tariff  mysqlqueryquerytariff, MySQL or diemysqlerror   Create array of tariffids i  0 tariffidlist  array while rowtariff  mysqlfetchassoctariff  tariffidlist[i]  rowtariff[tariffid] datelist[i]  rowtariff[dt] i  tariffidunique  arrayuniquetariffidlist   Drop the temporary table querydroptable  DROP TEMPORARY TABLE IF EXISTS temptable result3  mysqlqueryquerydroptable, MySQL or diemysqlerror  Here we start building the pseudotable using divs  echo ltdiv classcalendargt  Dates row echo ltdiv classtoprowgt  echo ltdiv classcalfirstcolgtampnbspltdivgt i  0 thisdatestrtotimefirstdate while i lt 12  dayweek  dateD, thisdate  daynum  datej, thisdate monthname  strtoupperdateM, thisdate echo ltdiv classcaldatesgt echo dayweek.ltbrgtltspan classcaldaygt.daynum.ltspangtltbrgt.monthname thisdate  thisdate86400 echo ltdivgt   echo ltdiv classcleargtltdivgtltdivgt   Room rows MySQL query to get rooms queryroom  SELECT roomid, roomtype, normalocc, singleocc, extrabed, childbed, cot FROM lhrooms WHERE hid  hid ORDER BY orderr ASC room  mysqlqueryqueryroom, MySQL or diemysqlerror while rowroom  mysqlfetchassocroom  foreach tariffidunique as value  tariffid  value roomid  rowroom[roomid] queryprice  SELECT  FROM lhprices WHERE tariffid  tariffid AND roomid  roomid price  mysqlqueryqueryprice, MySQL or diemysqlerror rowprice[value]  mysqlfetchassocprice   echo ltdiv classrowgt  echo ltdiv classcalfirstcolgt.rowroom[roomtype].ltdivgt thisdate  firstdate i0 while strtotimethisdate lt strtotimelastdate thisday  strtolowerdateD,strtotimethisdate echo ltdiv classcalpricecolgt if inarraythisday, werates  echo rowprice[tariffidlist[i]][pricewestd]    else echo rowprice[tariffidlist[i]][pricewdstd]  echo ltdivgt i thisdate  dateYmd,strtotime1 day,strtotimethisdate  echo ltdivgt  if rowroom[extrabed]gt1rowroom[childbed]gt1  echo ltdiv classrow hiddenrow styledisplaynonegt  echo ltdiv classcalfirstcolgtChild Extra Bedltdivgt thisdate  firstdate i0 while strtotimethisdate lt strtotimelastdate thisday  strtolowerdateD,strtotimethisdate echo ltdiv classcalpricecolgt echo rowprice[tariffidlist[i]][priceebc]  echo ltdivgt i thisdate  dateYmd,strtotime1 day,strtotimethisdate  echo ltdiv classcleargtltdivgtltdivgt     echo ltdivgt  gt codepre  pFIFTH EDIT  In reply to Rasclatt, this is what the table looks like after the script has run. img srchttpi.stack.imgur.comsjejR.jpg altenter image description here The datepicker, Previous, the checkbox and Next are all in the parent page.

Negative 43745 pSo Im working on a group project for school, and were working with a client who wants a companion app of sorts to go with his companies device. We provide the device a host IP or domain and it sends HTTP Post requests in the form of XML every 5 seconds or so. The problem were having is we have NO idea how to capture the data being sent on our server. Simply trying to grab and dump all POST data yields an empty array, and our attempts to use a socket have produced similar results. p  pWeve tried pointing the device to a hrefhttpposttestserver.com relnofollowhttpposttestserver.coma  and it gets the data perfectly, though there is no source code available to see how the site operates.

Negative 43745 pMy Android application has some screens that have some configurations that depends of specific parameters to determine what is going to be shown on the screen, like Showing or not some fields, changing position on screen of some fields, changing components types. I am using view helper pattern for each combination, because I dont want to add lots of if conditions on the view helper of the activity. I have tried to create a factory of view helpers that, depending of configuration, returns the respective view helper that configures the activity according to what I need. But I have some screens that might have more than 10 configurations. Considering that the number of possibilities follows the 2 pow n, which n is the number of configurations, in the previous sittuation, I would need to create 1024 view helpers  one for each possibility, which is clearly not a good idea. On the other hand, using the conditionals ifs, it would be very difficult for maintaining the project.p  pI would like some suggestions on what can be considered a good practice to this case. If possible, with examples of design patterns that can be used in this sittuation.p  pThanksp
Negative 43745 pI am working on a project Collectable Card Game that has me accessing several cards at once. Essentially,think solitaire. Where a lot of cards are on the stage at once, and you flip them over to reveal them.  The catch is each card can be reflipped and display a different card from the availableCards array.p  pInitially I would create a single object that held a different card in each frame. This works fine, but seems highly impractical due to so many objects on the stage, all of them holding every single frame... in other words, each card would be a full deck.p  pI restarted and decided to go with each card is its own object. So I stopped because before I get going again, I wonder if there is an even better way p  pDo I create one hundred cards in Flash and store their names in an array p  pCan I create a single card, and somehow get a card image from a clip with  one hundred framesp  pIf there is a way to have all the card images in a single object it would be easier to work with in Flash, but would that mean the whole object would have to be used just to show a single framep  pThanks in advance everyonep

Negative 43745 pIve been running into trouble using the animate.enabled method to programmatically disable and enable animation on a given element via a directive.

Check the console on that plnkr to see that the argument is Boolean.p  pIn my actual project, the directive Ive written to do this looks like thisp  precodecruncher.directivecrAnimateWhen, functionanimate      return          restrict A,         link functionscope, elem, attr              scope.watchfunction                  return scope.evalattr.crAnimateWhen             , functionshouldAnimate                  animate.enabledshouldAnimate, elem                             codepre  pThe shouldAnimate value is coming through loud and clear it doesnt seem to be a problem with the attribute evaluation.p  pIm aware that there are plenty of other approaches to selectively disabling angular animation Ive used them before, successfully.

Once the list is loaded when the user clicks on one of the products, the details and images of this product are loaded.p  pI dont want to load the collections associated to the products i.e Images when I display the list of all products but only when I need the details of one of them, for performance reasons, so Im using Lazy load.p  pHibernate is doing fine and I can see that initially I only load some of the atributes but not the collections, however in the rest service, when Jackson tries to access the collection to serialize it, Im getting this famous exceptionp  precodeCaused by org.hibernate.LazyInitializationException failed to lazily initialize a collection of role com.domainmodel.Product.Images codepre  pOf course at that moment there is no longer Session opened and the database transaction has been commited. I dont want to keep the session opened. So searching on the net I saw that we can tell Jackson not to serialize a property using the annotation JsonIgnore.  This annotation has to be placed in the property or getter of the Entity POJO, so basically, if I tell Jackson not to serialize this collection when serializing to JSON, it will solve the problem temporarily but once I need to load the product with the collection because the user has clicked on it, it wont serialize the collection so I will have this problem later.  So I dont think this is a solution for me. Any ideas, advices on how to solve this situation I post the code of the entity and the rest service here.

Negative 43745 pI would like to encrypt some user data before its sent to the server. That is, the data will be encrypted on the client side in browser using JavaScript.p  pMy question is, what options are available for storing private keys on the  client side it will be used for decrypting the data when user views it later onp  pHTML5 local storage or just reading local text file containing the key from JavaScript seems a bit off... Is it possible to use personal certificates for this purpose Or is there any other optionp  pstrongEDITstrong p  pSlight clarification,p  pAll the sensitive data that needs to be encrypted is generated on the client machine and it should never leave it in plaintext. The data in question is mostly files which user will upload to the server, however we might want to encrypt some form fields as well in the future.p  pOnce the encrypted data is sent to server it is stored in ciphered form and will never be decrypted anywhere else other than the strongsamestrong client machine. For example if the user decides to download his files back, he will receive encrypted files which will be decrypted in browser using JavaScript.p  pAlso its crucial for us that the PublicPrivate key pair is generated on the same client machine. This will be done only once manually by the user or with the help of some automated solution.p  pBottom line is, private key nor plaintext data should ever leave clients machine. p

Negative 43745 pWhen introducing the more precise rethrow feature of Java SE 7, the a hrefhttpdocs.oracle.comjavase7docstechnotesguideslanguagecatchmultiple.html relnofollowOracle documentationa uses the following examplep  precodestatic class FirstException extends Exception   static class SecondException extends Exception    public void rethrowExceptionString exceptionName throws Exception      try          if exceptionName.equalsFirst              throw new FirstException          else              throw new SecondException               catch Exception e          throw e       codepre  pSo, before Java SE 7, if you wanted to catch several types of exceptions at once using their supertype as a codecatchcode clause parameter and then rethrow the caught exception, you had to declare that supertype in the codethrowscode clause of the method. So, in this example, coderethrowExceptioncode must be declared using codethrows Exceptioncode. But with Java 7 or later, the same code could be rewritten in a different wayp  precodepublic void rethrowExceptionString exceptionName throws FirstException, SecondException      try       ...          catch Exception e          throw e       codepre  pSo, from my understanding of it, the precise rethrow is all about the compiler being able to deduce that the exceptions caught and rethrown by a codecatchcode using a supertype actually belong to a more narrow range of subtypes, so only those subtypes are required to be stated in the codethrowscode clause.p  pIn the same docs a set of condition is described that enables the mechanism of precise rethrow. I quotep  blockquote   pIn detail, in Java SE 7 and later, when you declare one or more exception types in a catch clause, and rethrow the exception handled by this catch block, the compiler verifies that the type of the rethrown exception meets the following conditionsp      ol   liThe try block is able to throw it.li   liThere are no other preceding catch blocks that can handle it.li   liIt is a subtype or supertype of one of the catch clauses exception parameters.li   ol blockquote  pstrongMy question is could somebody make the meaning of the 2nd and the 3rd condition clearstrong Details of my confusion ensue.p  blockquote   ol start2   liThere are no other preceding catch blocks that can handle it.li   ol blockquote  pWe are talking about a construct likep  precodecatch SomeException e        catch SomeOtherException e      throw e  codepre  pHow is it possible to violate the condition, i.e. so that codeSomeOtherException ecode would be caught by the codecatch SomeException ecode code and not create an unreachable code situationp  blockquote   ol start3   liIt is a subtype or supertype of one of the catch clauses exception parameters.li   ol blockquote  pThe meaning of this condition is completely unclear to me. In the situation from the first example, i.e.p  precodetry      throw new FirstException  catch Exception e      throw e  codepre  pwhat is considered a type of codeecode in the codethrow ecode statement codeExceptioncode, because codeecode is declared as a reference of this type, or codeFirstExceptioncode, because the actual exception that was thrown was of the codeFirstExceptioncode class Either way, the condition makes no sense. If the type of codeecode is viewed as codeExceptioncode, then how else could it be caught by the codecatch Exception ecode clause if their types were not the same or codeecodes type was not a subclass of codeExceptioncode And if the type of codeecode is deduced from the type of the actual object its referring to, which is, in our case, codeFirstExceptioncode, then how could such exception be caught by a codecatchcode clause using a subtype as a parameter in the first placep  pThere are two a hrefhttpsstackoverflow.comquestions25625317rethrowingexceptionhandledinprecedingcatchblocksimilara a hrefhttpsstackoverflow.comquestions26207241jdk7catchingmultipleexceptiontypesandrethrowingexceptionswithimprovedquestionsa out here already, but none of them answer my questions clearly.

Negative 43745 pI am just getting into the AngularJS world and loving it. Along with that, I am also working with a purchased Bootstrap design package. Within that package are table layouts that utilize the datatables.net plugin. I have an Angular controller working with a table retrieving things correctly via a RESTful API, but on each row I would like to have a button to edit  that pops up a modal. The popup is not the issue.p  pMy challenge comes when I want to render the button for each row. Per the DataTable reference there is an argument called mRender that be used for a given  rows data with a custom string. The fun part is, I want the button to utilize ngclick. Being that Angular is initialized prior to the DOM rendering this doesnt work so well.p  pIn doing research I found the compile method that provides quite a bit of functions for rendering a DOM element with registered events in Angular. Problem is, the DataTable API doesnt want a DOM element it wants HTML. I tried a little jQuery rig to convert back to.html, which works great to get the button on the page but the click event did not register.p  pI really dont want to rig anything up. I want this to be a proper design.

Negative 43745 h2Edith2  pI thought this was a bug, it is actually default behavior as described completely buried more like in the Qt documentation... When the active subwindow is maximized, the default behavior is to maximize the next subwindow that is activatedp  hr  h2Questionh2  pWhen there are multiple codeQMdiSubWindowcodes in a codeQMdiAreacode and some are flagged to Stay on Top they interact strangely with Maximised windows.

Negative 43745 pI am handling a huge catalogproduct based website on Magento with more than 10K SKUs.  We started off with Magento 7 years ago. Since then we have developed more than 10 magento websites  many stores on each magento installation. All these websites have many common products. The current project on which I am working is just a catalog with no cartbuying option.  For buying, we send the user to our parent site.p  pSo basically its a magento installation with memcache, Varnish , APC on Server. Whatever caching we do, we still get bottleneck whenever requests hit MySQL.p  pWe have decided to completely use MySQLMagento for backendproduct upload. Index whole website content to Solr documents and fetch the pages from Solr using NodeJS. Ultimately we want to achieve an environment where a User request would never go to MySQLMagento. User Search is Important. p  pAlso, we dont want to use Magentos PHTML anymore. Our Appfrontend will be an independent system which can fetch data from Solr not knowing who is indexing in Solr. We are doing this so that later our other MVCsCMSs can also index in same Solr.p  pMy Questionp  ol lipHow viable is this scenariopli lipWhat could be the Key Steps to do thispli ol  pPS I am experienced in MagentoPHPMysqlNoSQL with little exposure to LuceneSolr and NodeJS. Please dont suggest Installing Solr module in My current Magento because, as I said I am building a new Frontend and dont want to use PHTMLs.p

Negative 43745 pI had a question regarding inheritance with Androids declarestyleables. Ive searched google and the forums for a clear answer and was unable to locate one. It should be a simple question and answer... Anyway, if I have a declarestyleable like belowp  precodeltdeclarestyleable namechildgt     ltattr namechildAttr1 formatintegergtltattrgt ltdeclarestyleablegt codepre  pand I have declarestyleable that I want to act as a parent to this child, but is located in a library, how do I reference this in the child I know of the parent member but Im not sure on how I reference the parent from another declarestyleable in its associated library. Once this is done, how would I go about accessing the child and parent parameters in code Also, can I assign multiple parents to the child Thank you. p  pEDITp  pJust a side note as to why I need my code to function this way... Basically I am creating a widget that is based off of two custom widgets cannot modify these two. I need the style that the user would like to apply for each one. Thats why I need to inherit from multiple parents so the user can define these in the xml and I can also pass these values attribute set to the widgets used in the mainparent widget. Thank youp

Negative 43745 pIm not sure where to actually post this Im pretty sure someone will chastize me tell me where after of course voting me down  expected. p  pIve been developing a bunch of files for Safety Training at my facility. The UI is built in Excel with Excel VBA at its heart to get names and the Training program to run. The Excel file opens A PowerPoint presentation after getting your name and the program you desire and logs that data. When you are done with the presentation it opens as a Word doc  the quiz for that presentation. p  pMy issue is this currently all of our tests are created in Word I barely know Word VBA and would like to continue by just adding some text boxes and check boxes for the answers. Id like to add some code to facilitate the automatic scoring of these tests by placing a button at the end that locks the test so they cant change answers then checks and returns the test score.p  pI dont see where Word Files can be locked as in Excels Protect Sheet. The scoring I am using seems to be flawed but that is an issue I can work out later if I stay with Word. I am wondering if it wouldnt be better and maybe easier to do this in Excel as it is set up more for evaluating data input.p  pLooking for any advice on what others might do if they had a choice to use Word or Excel for creating tests. I currently have no preference except for the above  which I am not locked into in which format to use, possibly even using a separate PowerPoint Presentation as the test itself.p

Negative 43745 pI have a data frame that has some 561 columns and around 7300 rows. Now the problem is that I havent been able to delete the first header row that has V1...V561 as the variable names and instead switch it over to the row below that includes the actual variable names. I tried a lot of techniques since Ive already gone through a number of stack posts here, but none of them seems to be working in my situation. I even tried codecolnamesdf lt lapplydf[1,], as.charactercode but it doesnt really seem to work. In addition, I could use some help with another alternative, the names function but I dont know how to use it for my purpose.p  plets just say I have two data frames, one containing a single column of 561 cells that are to be transformed as variable names for the second data frame that has V1...V561 as variable names. See what I mean I need to replace that column of 561 cells from data frame 1, transforming them at the top of the second data frame, so I could have the actual variable names. Someone told me to use the names function but Im not that clear on the exact syntax since I havent really used this function much.p  pstrongEditstrongp  pHeres a much better way to describe of what needs to be done.p  pSo this is df1 that contains the single column that I need to put on the very first row of df2.p  precodedf1  x These are the variables  df2  x    y    z   x1 0    1    2   3 1    2    3   4 2    3    4   5 codepre  pThat has to be transformed intop  precodedf2 These    are    the   variables 0        1      2     3 1        2      3     4 2        3      4     5 codepre

Negative 43745 pIm new to Python and functional programming.  Im using version 2.7.6p  pIm using the Tornado framework to make async network requests.  From what I learned about functional programming, I want my data to stream through my code by using generators.  I have done most of what I need using generators and transforming the data as they stream through my function calls.p  pAt the very end of my stream, I want to make a REST request for some data.  I have one forloop just before I submit my data to Tornado, to initiate the pull, and then send the http request.  The http object provided by Tornado takes a callback function as an option, and always returns a Futurewhich is actually a Tornado Future object, and not the official Python Future.p  pMy problem is that since Im now using generators to pull my data through my code, I no longer want to use the callback function.  My reasoning for this is that after I get my data back from the callback, my data is now being pushed through my code, and I can no longer make use of generators.p  pMy goal is to create an interface that appears like sop  precodeurls  ...generated urls... responses  fetchurls codepre  pWhere responses is a generator over the completed urls.p  pWhat I attempted to doamong many thingsis convert the results from the callback into a generator. I was thinking about something like this, although Im far from implementing it for other issues I will soon explain.  However, I wanted my fetch function to look something like thisp  precodedef fetchurls     def urlgenerator         while True             val  yield             yield val      curry     def handlergen, response         gen.sendresponse      gen  urlgenerator      for u in urls         http.fetchu, callbackhandlergen      return gen codepre  pI simplified the code and syntax to focus on the problem, but I figured this was going to work fine.  My strategy was to define a coroutinegenerator which I will then send the responses to, as I receive them.p  pWhat Im having the most trouble with is the coroutinegenerator.  Even if I define a generator in the above manner and perform the following, then I get an infinite loopthis is one of my main problems.p  precodedef gen     while True         val  yield         print val, val         yield val         print after, val         break  g  gen g.sendNone g.send10  for e in g     print e codepre  pThis prints codeval 10 after 10code in the coroutine as expected with the break, but the forloop never gets the value of 10.  It doesnt print anything while the break is there.  If I remove the break, then I get the infinite loopp  precodeval None None after None None val None None after None None ... codepre  pIf I remove the forloop, then the coroutine will only print codeval 10code as it waits on the second yield.  I expect this.  However, using it doesnt produce anything.  p  pSimilarly, if I remove the forloop and replace it with codeprint nextgcode, then I get a StopIteration error, which I assume means I called next on a generator that had no more values.p  pAnywho, I am at a complete loss while I plunge into more depth on Python.  I figure this is such a common situation in Python that somebody knows a great approach.  I searched for convert callback into generator and such, but didnt have much luck.p  pOn another note, I could possibly yield each future from the http request, but I didnt have much luck waiting on the yield for the future to complete.  I read a lot about yield from, but it seems to be Python 3 specific and Tornado doesnt seem to work on Python 3 yet.p  pThanks for viewing, and thanks for any help you can provide.p

Negative 43745 pIm attempting to write an HDF5 writer to save messages produced by an eventdriven simulation. Is there an idiomatic way to do this in HDF5 p  pMy first thought was to make a compound datatype for each message type when we first get a message of that type, then save the message to an extendable dataset using that datatype. So the format of the file would be something like MessageType1, MessageType2 and so on, with MessageType1 and MessageType 2 being Nx1 datasets. But this produces annoyances when a subsequent message differs slightly from the format of the first. For example, since the simulation is written in MATLAB, the first message of a type can come in with a field that contains a scalar, say 1. All I can see is that this field is a scalar, so I create a scalar datatype in my compound datatype that represents the message. But the next message comes in and this field is now [1, 2]. Now this datatype is unusable with this message. I could make every numeric value a variable length type, but I suspect this introduces quite a bit of space overhead, and also seems decidedly unidiomatic.p  pAnother way I can see to do this is to create a group for each message type so you have MessageType1 and MessageType2 but these are groups, and each contains one dataset per message of that type, each with its own datatype. This will definitely solve the above issue, but it also produces quite a bit of overhead, because the recursive function generating the datatype will now have to be called on emevery single messageem. The function I wrote in MATLAB to create this datatype and write the message to a file takes 0.04 seconds which will definitely add up over the course of a simulation. I may be able to shave a couple hundredths of a second off by using MEX, but this still seems quite slow.p

I paid 5 bucks for the addon so that I have access to memory usage, keys in the cache etc. However, my graphs tell me that my app doesnt add any keys into the cache and the long response times on the website also suggest that my app is not caching where it needs to.p  pThe application is basically a social media website just like facebook. Getting the friends of a user is an expensive task that also required to be called often. So Id like to cache all the friends of all the users.p  pSo to do that I use the Rails.cache.fetch method. Here is the friends method looks like in my User model  p  precodedef friends   Rails.cache.fetchself.id do     forcefriends   end end  def forcefriends   userids  Friend.where     userid  id OR friendid  id AND pending  false,      id self.id   .pluckuserid, friendid    .flatten    .uniq    .reject  id id  self.id     users  User.whereid userids end codepre  pI believe my Redis to go setup is right since Im successfully able to run the following in my heroku rails consolep  precode heroku run rails console gtgt REDIS.setanswer, 42 OK gtgt REDIS.getanswer 42 codepre  pWhich suggests me that Im probably doing something wrong in my friends methodp

Negative 43745 pIm using Scala to produce HTTP, HTML and CSS. I also intend to use Scala to produce Javascript but I havent got to that stage yet.p  pWhat are the advantages of using separate style sheets CSS offers a form of multiple inheritance by which you can organise the styling of your mark up. However Scala already has its own system of multiple inheritance and other functional languages provide their own powerful methods of problem decomposition and declarative composition. While producing separate style sheets, adds algorithmic complexity and hinders the production of comprehensible clean code.p  pOne of the claimed advantages of separate style sheets is that they use less bandwidth. However I find it difficult to believe that CSS uses significant bandwidth compared to images let alone video. So do separate style sheets give advantages to search engine ranks and site classification Do they speed up or slow down rendering and layout Do they help accessibility and user defined style I would have thought not using separate style sheets might actually speed up delivery in HTTP 1.1 if not in 2.0p  pSimilarly with Head and Body nodes Tags. Do they serve any advantage to justify the added complexity of producing them programmatically They dont seem to make any functional difference to what the browser produces.p  pSo the question is how important are separate style sheets and Body and Head nodes to producing optimal web sites Is it OK to put CSS into the HTML leaf Nodes p

Negative 43745 pI am curious to know whether it is possible or good idea to build such a system using SPE. In our lab we developed strongHadoopstrong based transcoding and streaming service on a cluster of 20 nodes using codemkvtoolnixcode and codeXugglercode libraries for transcoding. And it works pretty well. However, I am not quite familiar with Storms usage in Multimedia Manipulation like transcoding. I just know that strongStormstrong is heavily used in Realtime Big Data Analytics.  My system is intended to process transcode from various video formats into mpeg4 realtime video data coming from video sensors and at the same time it should be able to stream the transcoded chunks of video to the dashboard.p  pHow can I achieve this using Storm, or any suggestions how to build such a system is very welcomep
