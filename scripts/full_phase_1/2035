Positive 2035 pI wrote my own avstream minidriver  for video splitting.  This driver works well for MS Windows 78.x10 x64, but there is an issue for x86 OS.  If I connect two and more appsskype, Adove flash encoder and etc to my driver, then it stops splitting.  By logs I defined the problem was in KsPinGetLeadingEdgeStreamPointer. This function returns me a pointer to  KSSTREAMPOINTER, by using which the driver sends video frames to an appp  precodevoid CCapturePinPinProcess  ......

Positive 2035 pI have a requirement. My process has to forkexec another process during one of its code paths.

Positive 2035 pwe were having a problem with SPI communication with FPGA and tried communication with example codes in documentationspi folder in kernel source code.p  pin my project i use spi like the example in spidevfdx.c   read write functions . and im transferring 572 bytes per packet  32 bit word length  16 MHz  which makes 143 words. when I check with osiloscope I see 144 words. and the timings are like  XXXXXXXXX. 1 word then wait, then 143 words. CS is always low, not going high at where the delay is. Ill post images when i can. I tested and found out 1 word is sent for 40 and more words 160 bytes. so it is ok when i send 39 words 156 bytes.p  pI changed transfer sizes in spidevtest.c and spidevfdx.c and run same tests that I did for my code. spidevfdx.c behaves same way. but spidevtest.c sends 143 words with no hugeextra delay between words. p  pnote spidevtext.c fills some struct and uses ioctl function.p  pany tip  idea would be appreciated if Im missing a point here and causing this problem.p  pkind regards allp

Positive 2035 pemT1em is the time taken to switch from user process process p1 to p2 while emT2em is time taken to switch from process p1 to kernel process  Now which will be more T1 or T2. For me it should be T1, my logic is, when the CPU is allocated to process p2 by removing p1 the kernel will have to first take control in its hands amp remove the PCB of p1 and load PCB of p2. While in case of p1 to kernel, it just have to give control to kernel. Am I rightWrong p

Positive 2035 pIn NetBSD system file usrsrcsyssysvnode.h defines structure of a vnode. However, I see that sometime while performing an operation lets say ufsgetattr a vnode is passed as a void to the called operation.p  pEach such operation has its arguments structure. For Ex, ufsgetattr the structure is as followsp  precodestruct vopgetattrargs                   struct vnode    avp                 struct vattr    avap                 kauthcredt    acred  codepre  pGenerally, first line of these operations perform an assignment of vnode pointer, which was actually a void, into a pointer of this argument type pointer.

Negative 2035 pA friend of mine is now building a web application with J2EE and Struts, and its going to be prepared to display pages in several languages.p  pI was told that the best way to support a multilanguage site is to use a properties file where you store all the strings of your pages, something likep  precodewelcome.english  Welcome welcome.spanish  Bienvenido ... codepre  pThis solution is ok, but what happens if your site displays news or something like that a blog I mean, content that is not static, that is updated often... The people that keep the site have to write every new entry in each supported language, and store each version of the entry in the database. The application loads only the entries in the users chosen language.p  pHow do you design the database to support this kind of implementationp  pThanks.p
Negative 2035 pFirst off, this question is ripped out from a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions56215interestinginterviewquestions56291 relnofollowthisa question. I did it because I think this part is bigger than a subpart of a longer question. If it offends, please pardon me.p  pAssume that you have a algorithm that generates randomness. Now how do you test it Or to be more direct  Assume you have an algorithm that shuffles a deck of cards, how do you test that its a perfectly random algorithmp  pTo add some theory to the problem  A deck of cards can be shuffled in 52 52 factorial different ways. Take a deck of cards, shuffle it by hand and write down the order of all cards. What is the probability that you would have gotten exactly that shuffle Answer 1  52.p  pWhat is the chance that you, after shuffling, will get A, K, Q, J ... of each suit in a sequence Answer 1  52p  pSo, just shuffling once and looking at the result will give you absolutely no information about your shuffling algorithms randomness. Twice and you have more information, Three even more...p  pHow would you black box test a shuffling algorithm for randomnessp

Negative 2035 pI have Drupal 5 site where a button is clicked and it calls a JavaScript function. The function basically builds a string, and then redirects to another page on our site. After clicking the button, sometimes the user gets logged out and sees the Access Denied screen, even though they were previously logged in. The page where they are being redirected has the same access restrictions as the previous page, but regardless of that, they shouldnt be getting logged out.p  pOne user has this happen about half the time the other half it works as it should, and another user has reported always being logged out when clicking that button. However, Im always able to run it without a hitch on the machines I use, and I suspect it has to do with them using IE6. Has anyone run across this issue before, or have any ideas on what could be causing this Ive searched and posted in the Drupal forum, and searched in this forum, and have had no luck yet.p

Negative 2035 pTo my knowledge SQL Server 2008 will only allow one clustered index per table.  For the sake of this question lets say I have a list of usersubmitted stories that contains the following columns.p  pID int, primary keybr  Title nvarcharbr  Url nvarcharbr  UniqueName nvarchar This is the url slug blahblahblahbr  CategoryID int, FK to Category tablep  pMost of the time stories will never be queried by ID.  Most of the queries will be done either by the CategoryID or by the UniqueName.p  pIm new to indexing so I assumed that it would be best to place 2 nonclustered indexes on this table.  One on UniqueName and one on CategoryID.  After doing some reading about indexes it seems like haivng a clustered index on UniqueName would be very beneficial.  Considering UniqueName is... unique would it be advantageous to place the primary key on UniuqeName and get rid of the ID field  As for CategoryID I assume a nonclustered index will do just fine.p  pThanks.p

Negative 2035 pI have a set of classes that all need to be acted on in some individual way.p  pOrdinarily Id just create a codeDoSomethingInterfacecode with a single codedoSomethingcode method and have each class implement that method in a way that suits each class needs.

One solution is to create codeBarcode on the heap, using codeBar bar  new Barcode.

But, is it the right thing to do So far, I have used it sometimes to create referencecounted objects, but I have kept my APIs clean of codesharedptrcode. How do you deal with this problem that, once you use codesharedptrcode you have to use it strongeverywherestrong p  pAlso, if you use these referencecounted pointers, you have to start worrying about if you really want codesharedptrcode or rather codeweakptrcode etc.p  pAnd, what would I use as an equivalent to codeFooconst Baramp barcode codeFooconst sharedptrltconst Bargt barcode p  pAnother option, of course, is to add reference counting inside the codeBarcode and other objects yourself, using codepimplcode and your own counters, but that gets too tedious as a general rule.p

Negative 2035 pIve built an iPhone application using the parsing code from the TopSongs sample iPhone application. Ive hit a problem though  the feed Im trying to parse data from doesnt have a separate field for every piece of information i.e. if it was for a feed about dogs, all the information such as dog type, dog age and dog price is contained in the  feed. However, the TopSongs app relies on information having its own tags, so instead of using  it uses  and .p  pSo my question is this. How do I extract this information from the description field so that it can be parsed using the TopSongs parser Can you somehow extract the dog age, price and type information using Yahoo Pipes and use that RSS feed for the feed Or is there code that I can add to do it in applicationp  pstrongUpdatestrong To view the code of my application parser based on the TopSongs Core Data Apple provided application, see below.p  pHeres a sample of one item from the the actual RSS feed Im using the description is longer, and has status,size, and a couple of other fields, but theyre all formatted the same.p  precodeltitemgt lttitlegtMOE, MARGRET STREETlttitlegt ltdescriptiongt ltbgtDistrictRegionltbgtampnbspREGION 09ltbrgtltbgtLocationltbgtampnbspMOEltbrgtltbgtNameltbgtampnbspMARGRET STREETltbrgtltdescriptiongt ltpubDategtThu,11 Mar 2010 054303 GMTltpubDategt ltguidgt1266148ltguidgt ltitemgt             File iTunesRSSImporter.m  Abstract Downloads, parses, and imports the iTunes top songs RSS feed into Core Data.

For this application,  out parsing needs are relatively modest  we need only match the node name. An item node is a record of  data about a song. In that case we create a new Song object. The other nodes of interest are several of the  child nodes of the Song currently being parsed. For those nodes we want to accumulate the character data  in a buffer. Some of the child nodes use a namespace prefix.    static void startElementSAXvoid parsingContext, const xmlChar localname, const xmlChar prefix, const xmlChar URI,                              int nbnamespaces, const xmlChar namespaces, int nbattributes, int nbdefaulted, const xmlChar attributes      iTunesRSSImporter importer  iTunesRSSImporter parsingContext      The second parameter to strncmp is the name of the element, which we known from the XML schema of the feed.

At that point we finish processing that node,  if it is of interest to us. For item nodes, that means we have completed parsing a Song object. We pass the song  to a method in the superclass which will eventually deliver it to the delegate. For the other nodes we  care about, this means we have all the character data.

Negative 2035 pMy companys web architecture has essentially got an extra layer due to client security requirements, which complicates the process of developing applications a bit. Id like to get some input and suggestions on the best way to do so.p  pFirst, an overviewp  ul lipresentation layer  this is mostly PHP, with some flex applications as well. We may be adding HTML5JavascriptjQuery to this soon. This tier cannot see our database layer, and is the only layer that is visible to the outside world.li liapp layer  this is currently mostly PHP. It has access to the databaseli lidb layer  this is reachable only from nonDMZ hosts.li ul  pRight now, Flex applications and clientside javascript that need to make calls to the app layer  which is a fair number of them  make it through a PHP proxy running on the presentation layer, which passes the request in to the app layer. These are usually AMF service requests, but we could proxy RESTful requests as well with minimal effort.p  pI have an opportunity to replace a lot of this stack right now, provided I can retain the basic security characteristics. What I want is to be able to write JavaScript or Flex apps that make RESTful calls to services visible in the presentation layer that will transparently or transparently enough proxy into the app tier, where the actual work is done.p  pThe thing is, every tutorial I see on for example Django or other pythonic web  REST frameworks seems to assume that the services provided by my presentation and application layers here are provided by one layer only. I need advice on how to write, essentially, web services using Python. The app layer must authenticate the client and maintain client sessions. The web layer proxy does not do that because it has no database access. This sort of thing is what pointed me at Django, with its cached session tracking, for example.  But, truthfully, Im open to anything that gets me away from writing PHP4 for this.p

Negative 2035 pI have the runofthemill loginbased PHPSESSID mechanism implemented for my web app.  One aspect that bothers me is the simple scenario where a user orphans his session in browser A on computer A, opens another in browser B on computer B, orphans this to walk back to browser A and so forth.  Possibly all this within the reasonably lengthy time span for which the PHPSESSID cookies are valid.  If both sessions display the user static data, and the user is manipulating this, then the two browsers will not necessarily show data that is consistent with whats in the database.  p  pMy preferred response to this scenario is for the second login two invalidate the first.  I can keep one PHPSESSID associated with the userID in the database.  Thats easy enough.  Now the hard part  on the second login, how can I invalidate the PHPSESSID thats written into the database such that a subsequent access from the first sessions with the now invalidated PHPSESSID will fail  p  pI cannot use sessiondestroy because that wants to kill the second PHPSESSID, the one I actually want to keep.  And I cannot use setCookie for exactly the same reason.p  pOne idea I had involves a database access sequence number.  Each new request returns the previous plus one.  If out of sequence, sessiondestroy the current enquirer.  Slight inconvenience I see with this is that it requires an extra database fetch to recover the sequence number before each user access.p  pIs there any way of associating this sequence number with a userID somewhere inside the servers cache that doesnt involve any cookie transmissionsp  pThanks.p

Im putting together a new software team and Im looking at different tools that overcome previous nightmares Ive had with other teams.   p  pOver the last 56 years these are some transitions Ive gone thru  p  pstrongSourceControlstrongbr CVS  VSS  SVN    p  pstrongProject Management, Bug and Issue Trackingstrongbr Paper  PostIt Notes  OneNote  BugNet  OnTime  p  pstrongWiki and Documentationstrongbr Word  Network Share  ScrewTurn Wiki    p  pstrongBuilder Automationstrongbr Cruise Control  MSBuildp  pNow, specially because of SVN and the Wiki situation, Im looking into starting this team with something fresh. In the past weve had branching nightmares with SVN, and the more we try to fix it, the worst it becomes. The other challenge I have is to find something that is stable and integrated. You can imagine that BugNetSVNScrewTurnCruiseControlMSBuild are quite different animals, so integration and synergy is very important I dont want to be jumpint between 10 different applications to report a bug or assign tasks and review the work completed and look at the repo log.br So, the new team and I have been talking this out for a couple of days now, and I think weve narrowed it down to 2 posibilitiesbrbr strong1. TFS 2010strongbr emProsembr  AllinOne solution. It truly has it all, including a new SCRUM process template.br  Very friendly user interface and SharePoint integration.br  WYSIWYG Wiki and Office Integration.br emConsembr  High upfront costs in hardware and admin time. Software too, but it doesnt affect us because we have an MSDN subscription with free software.br  Im hesitant about the source control of TFS. strikeSC is filebased and with central repository just like SVN and VSS. I really dont want to fall for the same issues weve had in the past.strike p  pstrong2. FugBUgs  Kiln  CCstrongbr emProsembr  Kiln uses Mercurial, with all the benefits of distributed source control.br  Minimal upfront costs and planning time to get it up and running. 30.00 per user per month.br  Very friendly web user interface.br  WYSIWYG Wiki editor.br  Very simple issue tracker and project management tools. It would be easy to integrate SCRUM processes.br emConsembr  Lacks builder automation tools for more integrated processes like TFS. So this will mean well have to keep on banging our heads with command line functions and community tasks to maintain our builder workers.  p  pBack in the day, I used Visual Studio Team System 2005 and I didnt take the best memories with me about the system but the new TFS 2010 seems a very solid bet. FogBugz and Mercurial are kinda like the new kids in the block and they bring fresh thinking to the new processes, but as always this is a double edge sword.br Anybody with solid experience with any of these Are we missing that 3rd option Do you have that silver bullet for my problems  p  ol liTools Integrationbr 1.1. Source Controlbr 1.2. Wikibr 1.3. Build Automationbr 1.4. Project managementbr 1.5. Issue Tracker  li liMinimize Source Control Branching and Merging conflicts yes, it is necessary for us to branch out and merge  li liFriendly User Interface not everybody is CMD hacker  li liWYSIWYG Wiki.  li liLearning Curve for developers.  li liTime to get it all running VS. Long Term Value.    li ol  pThe new team has 4 team members  1 Project Manager Scrum Master and 1 Product Manager Product Owner. So we are talking about a relatively small and new team.  the scope and projects well be working on is large, enterprise applications with multiple projects and branching variationsp
Negative 2035 pI am little confused about how to get the top frame in an application. I start off my application with the usualp  precodeclass AppFrameClientGUI.MyFrame ClientGUI.MyFrame generated by wxformbuilder.  def initself      create some panels.

But this seems rather convoluted given that all the intermediate objects dont need access to the application. p  pIs there a clean way to access the application object  Also, what exactly do I want to access  the frame object or the app object  Im not sure of the difference between these two objects. p

Negative 2035 pI have built a family tree program which thus far allows you to add relationships to nodes mother, father, partner amp siblings. This allows the tree to be built. well at least the links to be made. p  pMy problem is I have to represent the tree textually. This is proving to be very hard. I thought of allowing to display the ancestors and descendants for a particular node but this proves to be difficult, especially when there are more than two generations for displaying ancestors great grandparents and above. p  pTo make things more clear I thought of using a file tree structure but got into a mess when displaying for great grandparents. p  pI can provide the source if anyone wants to see it. p  hr  pWhat I mean is using a file structure starts of with a pair of people  e.g. p  pGRANDAD amp GRANDMA br DADbr  ME br SISTER br AUNTbr  COUSIN br COUSIN brp  pThis would be for showing my ancestors on my dads side inclusive of me. My question is what happens if both my grandparents have parents How would I represent such relationships with the above structure I would have to show my great grandparents but there would be two sets One for my grandma and one for my grandad. The root has been split into two if you see what I mean....p  pI though about limiting the show ancestors function to show only 2 generations above. Which means that a user can traverse through the tree and indentify hisher great grandparents by selecting their parent nodes and displaying their ancestors  but this seems laborious and not very intuitive.p

Negative 2035 pIs it a correct assessment that compiling with m32 and mtunenative on a AMD64 machine will use 32 bits for pointers and hence slightly smaller data structures, and consequently a denser cache packing. My application it is still in its design stage will not need more than a GB of memory so a 32 bit address space should be fine. I am hoping to utilize the bitshrunk data structures for more data in cache, and also the potential to use more registers for integer math. What I am trying to achieve is the best of both worlds, more registers by virtue of mtunenative, but smaller pointers by m32. Will the availability of extra registers be taken care of largely automatically or do I have to deal explicitly with sse. I would rather not. p
Negative 2035 pI have a classic ASP website that posts a form to a page that then generates and streams an Excel file out to users. Actually, its a raw HTML table which I send withp  precodeResponse.AddHeader ContentDisposition, inline filenamefile.xls Response.AddHeader ContentType, applicationvnd.msexcel codepre  pThe intranet website is secured via integrated windows authentication. No other access mode is checked. The user logs in with their network password and all is well.p  pNow, when the user submits the form, this action results in two more login dialogs. You can actually cancel out of both and still open the file. In fact, if you put in your credentials, it requires you to enter them four times If you check Remember password, it doesnt affect the need for logging in. Also, this happens even if the URLs are listed on the Trusted Sites section of IE.p  pAny ideas on what I can do to minimize thisp  pPS Not sure, but seems to be a relatively recent issue, meaning a more recent version of IE 78, Office 2007 and or Windows Vista7.p  pUPDATE Using Fiddler, I can see that something called UserAgent MicrosoftWebDAVMiniRedir6.1.7600 is attempting to connect, and getting 401.2ed.

Negative 2035 pI am trying to find unicode variants of a userentered character in a text for highlighting them. E.g. if user enters Beyonce id like to highlight all text with variants like Beyonc or Beynce or Bynce in the text. Currenty the only idea i have is creating a regex by replacing the input string with a set of character groups like thisp  precodeBeyonce gt B[e]y[]c[] codepre  pBut this seems to be a very tedious and error prone way of doing it. What I am basically looking for is a regex character group that matches all variants of a given input character, something like pM but with the possibility to specify the base letter. Is there something available like this in java regex And if not, how could the regex creation process be improved I dont think that specifying all variants by hand is going to work in the long run.p

Negative 2035 pI am creating an application that gets thousands of word documents from an Oracle database and need to transform them into pdf and send them back to database. I already have all the support mechanism database interaction, multitasking and a plugable approach to database and configuration up and running. In spite of all warnings about using office automation in the server side my first approach was to use it the truth is that my customer asked to use it. But Im going mad with the interaction between c .Net 4.0 and word 2007. I already tried the SaveAs and the ExportAsFixedFormat. Both worked fine but when I try to close the word... I got an erro pop up window saying that word found a problem and will be closed. Then I tried to include this before quitting the applicationp  precodewordApplication.NormalTemplate.Saved  true codepre  pBut it still throwing the errror. Im unable to convert more than one hundred docs without an error. Do you know some way to achieve this conversion without using office automation Or in the other hand, do you know how to do this conversion through office automation without errors Any help will be

Negative 2035 pI basically need to make a compiler for bibtex files, such that a given bibtex database can be queried. Now Im familiar with certain aspects of theory, like automata, grammars, SLR,LR1 and LALR parsing. However, I still find all of that theoretical and abstract, since Ive never applied it. It would help a lot if someone could outline the solid steps required to build a compiler. Ill be using flex and bisonyacc probably, so if you could let me know how exactly the design process goes, what files are generated at what stage, what is the output at each stage, and in general how things tie together, I can probably get a more practical view of how things are done...p  pThanksp

Negative 2035 pI am working on a system which now requires versions to be maintained. Will explain you the project in brief. We have a CMS in which there are three users 1. Super Admin, 2. Editor, 3. Approver. Editor adds data from CMS and send it to approver if he approves the data only in that case it is visible on the front end. Now if the editor edits the same data then its disapproved and removed from the frontend and agian he will send it to the approver and the same process will follow. This is how its working now.p  pThe client has now changed the requirement and now what he wants is that once the data is approved and visible in the site i.e frontend and the editor now edits the data it should not be removed from the frontend and new edited data should be send for approval and when the approver approves the data the old one should be replaced with new one in the front end.p  pThe database design is real bad so its going to be difficult to achieve this.p  pThe solution that we have thought of is... For example the Editor can add some kind of news in the front end. All the data w.r.t news is added in news table. Editor adds the news sends it for approval and then he approves. Till here there are no issues. Now suppose that for some reason he wants to edit the same news which is approved. The moment he clicks on edits button it is removed from front end so what we thought is like maintain another table something like tempnews with the same structure and the moment he clicks on edit news after its being approved a new record should be inserted in tempnews table with the values from news table added in this table. Till then in frontend we will display the news from news table. So now we have the same news data in two tables. Approver and editor can now do all the changes and we will update the tempnews table. The moment approver approves this changed data we will update the news table with values from tempnews table. so now in front end we have the updated news. The problem with this solution is that once the changed is approved both tables news and tempnews have the latest data. This not versioning. Need a solution for this.p  pI am just a beginner. p

Negative 2035 pWe are attempting to concatenate possibly thousands of rows of text in SQL with a single query.  The query that we currently have looks like thisp  precodeDECLARE concatText NVARCHARMAX  SET concatText    UPDATE TOP SELECT MAXPageNumber  1 FROM OrderedPages [OrderedPages]  SET concatText  concatText  [ColumnText]    WHERE RTRIMLTRIM[ColumnText]   codepre  pThis is working perfectly fine from a functional standpoint.  The only issue were having is that sometimes the ColumnText can be a few kilobytes in length.  As a result, were filling up tempDB when we have thousands of these rows.p  pThe best reason that we have come up with is that as were doing these updates to concatText, SQL is using implicit transactions so the strings are effectively immutable.p  pWe are trying to figure out a good way of solving this problem and so far we have two possible solutions 1 Do the concatenation in .NET.  This is an OK option, but thats a lot of data that may go back across the wire.p  p2 Use .WRITE which operates in a similar fashion to .NETs String.Join method.  I cant figure out the syntax for this as BoL doesnt cover this level of SQL shenanigans.p  pThis leads me to the question Will .WRITE work If so, whats the syntax  If not, are there any other ways to do this without sending data to .NET We cant use codeFOR XMLcode because our text may contain illegal XML characters.p  pThanks in advance.p

I would like a javascript and php solution.p  pI have tried google and cannot find any solutions for this and I found a tutorial once but now I have lost that link  So any kind of help in form of a link, piece of code or what to look for will help.p  pOne thing that I wanted was having the widget start with a delay of fetch data but start displaying the data after 5 seconds of the intial fetch and then fetch data every 2 seconds, however load data second by second.

Negative 2035 pIm doing a spot of research surrounding Entity Framework and its associated .edmx files.p  pOur current setup has a number of these files compiled in to a library that we use extensively. Of course, this isnt exaclty an elegant solution  every time we want to update or add to something in the database layer, we need to recompile this library. p  pWe use stored procedures exclusively, and our current approach is to use the codeExecuteFunctioncode method on the object context. However, this does require knowledge of what imported functions from an edmx file return what type codecontext.ExecutionFunctionltTgtcode returns codeObjectResultltTgtcode.p  pMy theoretical solution is to store any .edmx files we want to use at a relative path, and have the library load them all at run time. p  pHas anybody tried this before Does it work Are there any performance considerations to take in to account This would be used in an ecommerce environment, so efficiency and speed is important.p  pstrongEDIT FOR SOME MORE CLARITYstrongp  pIt would certainly be possible to compile each individual .edmx file in to its own assembly, which might allow the use of a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibrarybb495513.aspx relnofollowthisa. Any input on that, too, would be great.p  pThe call we make now is something like thisp  precodeDatabase.MakeCallltTgtstoredprocedurename, parametersCollection, KnownDatabases.Database codepre  pIn its constructor, the database handler will hold instances of each of the database contexts it knows about each of the.edmx files in the library . Using the codeKnownDatabasescode enum, it chooses which database to run the query against.p  pIdeally, Id like to achieve a call like thisp  precodeDatabase.MakeCallltTgtcontextname, storedprocedurename, parametersCollection codepre  pWhere in the database handler will, in its constructor, search a folder for .edmx files and load them all, then store instances of each context against the context name. How codeTcode would be defined or obtained is a little blurry right now.p  pIn both cases, the return type would be codeObjectResultltTgtcodep

Negative 2035 pI want to generate a unique 46 char long AlphaNumeric string to save in db with each recorduser. The db field has a unique index, so trying to save a preexisting string generates an error. Right now I am generating a random string and using trycatch, so when adding a new record if it throws an exception, I generate another random string and attempt to save again, and the code keep trying until it adds a record successfully. This whole solution not only looks heavy but also ugly, so I want to change it. I am interested in an elegant solution, so any helpguidance is welcome.p

Negative 2035 pI am trying to overlay my own custom images on top of a codeMapViewcode in Android.  It is important that my images align correctly with the underlying Google Maps tiles, because it is a map of a university campus whose features must align with Googles underlying tile features.  Are the tiles Google provides for a given geographic rectangle always the same size in pixels, regardless of display density, or does Google transmit tiles of higher or lower resolution for higherlower display density devicesp  pI know in the static maps Javascript API there is a a hrefhttpcode.google.comapismapsdocumentationstaticmapsscalevaluesscalea parameter that can be parsed to have higher resolution tiles returned.  I am just curious as to whether the Android codeMapViewcode is also capable of returning higherlower resolution tiles.  In the event codeMapViewcode does return tiles at varying resolutions, is there anyway to programatically find what this resolution is, so I can scale my own overlaid imagery accordinglyp

Negative 2035 pSo, to start, I have seen posts like this a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions6521545howtofindwhichconditionistruewithoutusingifstatementHow to find which condition is true without using if statementap  pIts not quite what I need, although the idea is pertinent, in that I would like it to be more readable code.p  pI think Switch is the best bet, but let me explain.p  pI have this statement    p  precodeif input  string.Empty  typeComboBox.Text  null      MessageBox.ShowNothing to encrypt, Nothing Selected                 return null  codepre  pSo the idea here is that I used to have this statement broken into two IF statements, which isnt a huge deal, but for readability sake, and my on going effort of reducing code, I wanted to combine the statements into one.  p  pIf input is empty, I want the first argument in MessageBox.Show to appear, but not the second.p  pIf typeComboBox.Text is null, I want the second option to appear, but not the first.p  pIf they are both true statements, I want both to appear.p  pNow, my goal was to have these both done without the use of more than one test or method.  Basically, I mean this if I can find which condition is true and have the resultant data output within the same statement, that would be ideal. p  pI see switches being an option, and I dont understand them very well yet, but I think that would require me to make a decision method based on the outcome of this test, and send that outcome to the switch which wouldnt be ideal, as I could simply have two if statements and less code.p  pIs there any way to do this in one statement  Its not necessary for this specific program, but I want to know for the future.p  pThanksp

Negative 2035 pI am experiencing an APPCRASH from my C application.  The Runtime gives an error message of This application has requested the Runtime to terminate it in an unusual way.  Then, when I click okay I get a MyApplication has stopped working message with the usual check online for a solution, close program and debug program options.  When I click additional details I get the APPCRASH signature, with lots of additional information.  Some of it is human readable, some of it is just hex numbers.  The Exception Code is 40000015.  There are also lines of Additional Information.  My question is does anyone in the universe know what the information in an APPCRASH message meansp  pIt seems like the message was meant to be read by someone who can divine a cause from it.  When searching for answers I found a lot of people posting messages formatted exactly the same.  Unfortunately, I have found no explanations of what this information means.p  pAlso, I have tried the Debug Program option, but it is unhelpful.  It just puts me in system dlls with none of my code anywhere up the call stack.  Ive investigated, and the error doesnt occur in this system code.p  pThe APPCRASH message named another dll as the Fault Module this code uses a lot of external dlls, and the fatal error probably occurs there. But that information isnt very helpful because I need to find the place in my code that makes a bad call to the external dll or puts it in a bad state.  Sadly, when I say my code I just mean the code that Im working with.  Its a huge codebase written by several dozen people over a couple years, so I cant just guessing places that might make the fatal call.  Thats why I was hoping to divine more information from the APPCRASH message.  Thats also why Im being very stingy with details.  The whole thing is all very proprietary with lots of red tape.  Thats also why I havent posted the APPCRASH message contents.p  pTo be clear, I am not asking you to debug my problem for me.  I have no way of giving you a reproducible case of the error, and Im not asking anyone to tell me the cause of the error in my specific case.  I just want to know how to interpret those hex numbers, and I havent been able to find any documentation.p

Negative 2035 pA client wants me to migrate his very big Microsoft Access database to a SQL server, keeping Access as the frontend. They have many users already and performance issues are getting worse.p  pNow, which SQL server would be most appropriatep  pcodeMySqlcode I have many years experience with MySQL and consider myself an expert, although not in connection with Access. Being free, MySQL is also attractive to my client.p  pcodeMSSQLcode I was once very experienced with MSSQL but it was 12 years ago or more. Much has happened since. But being a Microsoft product, I figure that data migration to the SQL server and use with Access in general might be somewhat more streamlined, which could perhaps compensate for the lack of recent experience with the product.p  pSo, how is it working with MySQL as a backend for Access as opposed to MSSQL Should I count on major obstacles that would work increase the time needed for the migration considerably or would my great experience with MySQL more than compensate for such obstaclesp

While its true that meridians of longitude are the vertical lines drawn NorthtoSouth or vice versa and that parallels of latitude are the horizontal lines drawn EasttoWest, points along those line represent the NorthSouth location based on parallels of latitude, and represent EastWest locations based on meridians of longitude. This seemed backwards in my mind until I visualized the lines spinning across longitude and up and over latitude the earth, rather than simply circling the earth like the rings of Saturn do what also helped get my perception right was reminding myself that it is the values of the meridians of longitude that determine in which time zone one finds themselves. SO, the code above should change to pass latitudes to determine furthest North and furthest South, and conversely pass longitudes to determine furthest East and furthest West.p

I remember I had reverted all the changes I did to that file before closing it, so I decided to use codediffcode to see what had changed.

The window loads up fine, the right size, but nothing on the display is drawn. There is a blank screen and no changes I seem to make to the code affect what is drawn on the screen. This could be because I have a lack of understanding of how to do this correctly or it could be a problem in my codewith my computer.

I have a full migration in my project that I generated by running codeAddMigration ltmigration namegtcode and now Id like to create a SQL script using codeUpdateDatabase Scriptcode. However when I run that command EF checks my code and the development database, sees that everything is up to date and doesnt script a new migration.

Negative 2035 pIve been playing around with the idea of fulltext for some time now and in spite of all the reading and experimenting I have done I still feel I have an awful lot to learn about its advantagesdisadvantages and general practicalities.p  pFor a lot of things it appears to work fantastically well, however a major snag I have been having lately is when it comes to real peoples names  simply put, it refuses to cooperate when it comes to apostrophes, special characters, accents and the like. So I bit the bullet and decided to try and write my own trigger function to update the search field I wish to index.p  pFirstly the issue comes when searhcing for a name like Bjorn, when you could also have a Bjrn or a Bjrn, then how about or OLeary, fulltext splits the word into two pieces. What if somebody types the name without the apostrophe and so on.p  pIn an attempt to deal with it my current effort is as followsp  precodeCREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION quoteinsert RETURNS TRIGGER AS  DECLARE   Set to lowercase and convert any strange vowels or accents to ascii no Bjrns, Joss etc   myString text  toasciiconverttolowerNEW.name,latin1,latin1   nwString text     Split the words up by their spaces and put them in an array   myArray  text[]  regexpsplittoarraymyString, Es   nArray   text[]     These are counters for the secondary array, and for the apostrophe placement     n int  0     p int BEGIN   FOR i IN 1..arrayuppermyArray,1 LOOP     If it has an apostrophe hopefully only one split the words up like so oleary gt oleary o leary     IF position in myArray[i] gt 0      THEN       nArray[n]    regexpreplacemyArray[i], ,     n1                n  n1       p  position in myArray[i]       nArray[n]    substringmyArray[i],0,p    n1          n  n1       nArray[n]    substringmyArray[i],p1,lengthmyArray[i]    n1          n  n1     ELSE       nArray[n]    myArray[i]    n1          n  n1     END IF   END LOOP    Sort nArray here..........   not even sure if sorting alphabetically is important...   ............................    Turn the array back into a string   FOR i IN 0..arrayuppernArray,1 LOOP     nwString  nwString  nArray[i]   END LOOP   Set the search field to whatever string is generated   NEW.search  trimnwString   RETURN NEW END  LANGUAGE plpgsql codepre  pI nearly forgot, I previously added a very handy custom toascii script that I lifted from another sitep  precodeCREATE FUNCTION toasciibytea, name RETURNS text STRICT AS toasciiencname LANGUAGE internal codepre  pso, my script trigger produces text similar to that of fulltext, the only difference being that I noticed is that it arranges the words alphabetically. I do not know if it is necessary, or if it would be efficient to do so, but if I had to then suggestions on sorting would be welcome.p  pTo compare the results of this script and a fulltext it would readp  precodeMy query firing trigger function INSERT INTO table name VALUES Bjrn OLeary RETURNING search [search] bjorn1 oleary2 o3 leary4  Using fulltext SELECT totsvectorBjrn amp OLeary amp OLeary Obviously using oleary and oleary because of different sorting methods [totsvector] bjrn1 leari3 o2 oleari4 codepre  pAs you can see, it does not remove the special  character, and obviously I needed to insert OLeary to get a similar result.p  pSo, to ask questions Is it betternecessaryfaster to have your words organised alphabeticallyp  pSecondly... I hate to ask this now, but is there already a fulltext method of querying names that follow my critera I am just not aware ofp  pLastly, the real headache is that I have names spread across several tables inherited from a single one. I may consider adding an insertupdate to this trigger, to update a completely seperate search table. is this pushing it too farp
Negative 2035 pWe are building a URL shortening functionality for our site. p  pWhat weve come up at the moment p  ul liWe take a URL a hrefhttpwww.google.com relnofollowhttpwww.google.coma and sha1 it and end up with a 40 character hash 738ddf35b3a85a7a6ba7b232bd3d5f1e4d284ad1.li liWe take the sha1 hash and encode it into base62 basically AZ, az, 09 and end up with a 28 character hash jNMYchEoche67ro1k5gsCcHfDzmR that we can decode back to the original sha1. li ul  pThe reason we use sha1 is to make sure users cannot guess the next URL from the current  past  URLs.p  pThe reason we use base62 is to make the URL valid and readable to the user.p  pNow a 28 character shorturl that will be appended to our domain a hrefhttpwww.google.comrjNMYchEoche67ro1k5gsCcHfDzmRis relnofollowhttpwww.google.comrjNMYchEoche67ro1k5gsCcHfDzmRisa is a bit too long, especially when you consider Twitters character limit. p  pWhat were currently considering is cutting the sha1 down by around 20 characters, which would produce a 14 character shorturl, but going down any further and were worried we will run into collisions too quickly. p  pWe also thought about a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions1355100compressingbignumberorstringtosmallvalue13557011355701Compressing big number or string to small valuea but that would require us to split the 28 or 14 character hash into pieces of 2 and sort the pieces and we have no idea how to return to the original hash from there. p  pDoes anyone have any idea on what we could do We would prefer a solution where we do not depend on the database to construct the URL, but if a DB is required please keep in mind that were limited to Redis  MongoDB which means no autoincrement integer field.p
Negative 2035 pi have a list of boundaries polygons and a list of ways all represented by latitudes and longitudes. i would like to find out if one way is inside a polygon. i do this in perl but cant find anything useful to calculate.

Negative 2035 pWe have bought Team Viewer corporate, and need to deploy to our infrastructure, it includes Windows XP SP3, and Windows 7, our domain controller is Windows 2003 SP2, the setting of Team Viewer was exported to .reg file including the passwords and whitelists, I used the .vbs that Team Viewer provided to merge the registry values we exported earlier. At a testing environment that matches the real environment, the deployment itself runs perfectly using GPO, but the script doesnt run, if I tried to run the script manually by double clicking the .vbs file, I get open file security warning dialogue box, so I disabled it at the attachment manager by adding .vbs to the low risk list and everything worked fine, but the management refused this solution since it will endanger the network by marking all .vbs files as safe, and because it uses user configuration rather than using computer  configuration at GPO, why does this matter Because users are mobile throughout the regions where we operate, and when a user logs in using their credentials they will trigger the script and the deployment which will affect the network bandwidth. My question, is there any way to deploy Team Viewer and merge the registry file through .vbs using computer configuration at active directory GPOp

Another idea which comes to my mind is that this strange string did not have to bee hashed word necessary, but it might be for example some ID, which refers to word that I have typed in the past in this case few seconds ago until I hit Save to Phrasebook button. Is it possible to somehow decode this stringp

Any ideas what is causing this or how to fix it  Thanks for any help on thisp  precode0130528 070123.394 myapp[2510014003]  set USER center 20130528 070123.394 myapp[2510014003] spanVal lt0.300000gt 20130528 070123.503 myapp[2510014003] [CALayer prepareKeyForNewAnimation] unrecognized selector sent to instance 0x85781e0 20130528 070123.504 myapp[2510014003]  Terminating app due to uncaught exception NSInvalidArgumentException, reason [CALayer prepareKeyForNewAnimation] unrecognized selector sent to instance 0x85781e0  First throw call stack 0x1ec7012 0x1c3ae7e 0x1f524bd 0x1eb6bbc 0x1eb694e 0x55e9b 0x248053f 0x2492014 0x24827d5 0x1e6daf5 0x1e6cf44 0x1e6ce1b 0x2efe7e3 0x2efe668 0xb7effc 0x2042 0x1f75 libcabi.dylib terminate called throwing an exception   backtrace  thread 1 tid  0x1f03, 0x9bca39c6 libsystemkernel.dylibpthreadkill  10, stop reason  signal SIGABRT     frame 0 0x9bca39c6 libsystemkernel.dylibpthreadkill  10     frame 1 0x90065f78 libsystemc.dylibpthreadkill  106     frame 2 0x0250157b libsystemsimc.dylibabort  140     frame 3 0x02413f7b libcabi.dylibabortmessage  105     frame 4 0x02411a25 libcabi.dylibdefaultterminate  34     frame 5 0x01c3b0c1 libobjc.A.dylibobjcterminate  94     frame 6 0x02393652 libstdc.6.0.9.dylibstdterminate  21     frame 7 0x01c3b039 libobjc.A.dylibobjcterminate  11     frame 8 0x02492027 libdispatch.dylibdispatchclientcallout  33     frame 9 0x024827d5 libdispatch.dylibdispatchmainqueuecallback4CF  296     frame 10 0x01e6daf5 CoreFoundationCFRunLoopRun  1925     frame 11 0x01e6cf44 CoreFoundationCFRunLoopRunSpecific  276     frame 12 0x01e6ce1b CoreFoundationCFRunLoopRunInMode  123     frame 13 0x02efe7e3 GraphicsServicesGSEventRunModal  88     frame 14 0x02efe668 GraphicsServicesGSEventRun  104     frame 15 0x00b7effc UIKitUIApplicationMain  1211     frame 16 0x00002042 myappmainargc1, argv0xbffff364  130 at main.m16     frame 17 0x00001f75 myappstart  53 codepre  p[EDIT] Very bizarre.  This was happening in the simulator on ipad.  I tried plugging in my iphone 5 and I got a provisioning error even though it worked earlier and shouldnt have been an issue.  When I edited the dev profile and added a couple other users that I had and redownloaded it, it still didnt work.  When I went into the settings and changed the debugreleasedistro settings to the generic Developer profile for all three it now worked fine without crashing.

How can hazelcast store such a nested structure. If I pull the datacodea1code from hazelcast,can I get the nested codeb1codeIf so, then I should have the access to codea1code that contains codeb1code,then codeb1code has codea1code...then.....Is it possible for hazelcast to do serialization job for this endless nestingLike a infinity recursion..p  pTo make the question much simpler, if I store the data above in the hazelcast map, can I get the original data with relationships which I just pushedp

Negative 2035 pOk, so I am maintaining some legacy web form web site application.  On old box, the links between the projects are ok and intelisense recognizes the static public classes.  After moving the project to a new and faster development box, web forms do not see the utility classes.  E.g. p  pAspCommonCode.cs  projectp  pfoobar  website projectp  pWhile in the codebehind program called webform.aspx.cs I cannot see a common piece of code in AspCommonCode.cs in intelisense and the code does not compile because it cannot find the new static, public method in AspCommonCode.  p  pwebform.aspx.cs p  precode    using AspCommonCode      string FooBarr  CommonCode.Fooingtrue codepre  pThe new web project DOES not recognize the public static method called Fooing...p  pI am assuming I have to rebuild something or clear out something.  This exact same thing works on the old box with the old project settings.  p

Negative 2035 pFirstly, apologies for the length of this question, but I want to explain myself fully from the outset.p  pOK, a bit of background. Ive been working on some code that implements the Weak Event pattern using the codeWeakReferencecode object. In doing so I ran into the usual problem of objects being leaked in certain scenarios where a publisher stops raising events. If you are interested then theres a fair bit of a hrefhttpwww.codeproject.comArticles29922WeakEventsinC relnofollowinformationa on the pattern out there. The WPF team implemented the a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibrarysystem.windows.weakeventmanager.aspx relnofollowWeakEventManagera to tackle the problem which I believe uses a scheduler to check for any leaked objects and gets rid of them.p  pI decided to try a different approach. Instead of using a scheduler I wanted to trigger the detection and unsubscription of leaked objects using garbage collections. This seems logical to me as the targets of any codeWeakReferencecode objects are only dropped as a result of collections. This then led me to code up something which would raise an event when a garbage collection had taken place. Firstly I looked into using the frameworks codeGC.RegisterForFullGCNotificationcode mechanism but quickly realised it wasnt feasible as it a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibrarycc713687.aspx relnofollowcannot be used with concurrent garbage collectionsa. Then I did a fair bit of reading on the topic and found Jeffrey Richters a hrefhttpwintellect.comblogsJeffreyRreceivingnotificationswhengarbagecollectionsoccur relnofollowsolutiona but this has a couple of problems and only alerts you gen0 and gen2 collectionsp  pLong story short, I build the following simple class. The purpose of this class is to generate event notifications that a garbage collection has occurred. However, the mechanism for generating these notifications is based on the finalization of a detector object. As such, the events are NOT raised when a garbage collection is taking place but afterwards when the finalizer thread is run.p  precodeusing System  namespace Test       ltsummarygt      Class responsible for monitoring garbage collections.      ltsummarygt     public static class GarbageCollectionMonitor              private static readonly object syncLock         private static int generation0CollectionCount         private static EventHandlerltEventArgsgt generation0Subscriptions         private static int generation1CollectionCount         private static EventHandlerltEventArgsgt generation1Subscriptions         private static int generation2CollectionCount         private static EventHandlerltEventArgsgt generation2Subscriptions          public static event EventHandlerltEventArgsgt Generation0GarbageCollected                      add                              lock GarbageCollectionMonitor.syncLock                                      GarbageCollectionMonitor.generation0Subscriptions  EventHandlerltEventArgsgtDelegate.Combine  GarbageCollectionMonitor.generation0Subscriptions,                                                                                                                     value                                            remove                              lock GarbageCollectionMonitor.syncLock                                      GarbageCollectionMonitor.generation0Subscriptions  EventHandlerltEventArgsgtDelegate.Remove   GarbageCollectionMonitor.generation0Subscriptions,                                                                                                                     value                                                 public static event EventHandlerltEventArgsgt Generation1GarbageCollected                      add                              lock GarbageCollectionMonitor.syncLock                                      GarbageCollectionMonitor.generation1Subscriptions  EventHandlerltEventArgsgtDelegate.Combine  GarbageCollectionMonitor.generation1Subscriptions,                                                                                                                     value                                            remove                              lock GarbageCollectionMonitor.syncLock                                      GarbageCollectionMonitor.generation1Subscriptions  EventHandlerltEventArgsgtDelegate.Remove   GarbageCollectionMonitor.generation1Subscriptions,                                                                                                                     value                                                 public static event EventHandlerltEventArgsgt Generation2GarbageCollected                      add                              lock GarbageCollectionMonitor.syncLock                                      GarbageCollectionMonitor.generation2Subscriptions  EventHandlerltEventArgsgtDelegate.Combine  GarbageCollectionMonitor.generation2Subscriptions,                                                                                                                     value                                            remove                              lock GarbageCollectionMonitor.syncLock                                      GarbageCollectionMonitor.generation2Subscriptions  EventHandlerltEventArgsgtDelegate.Remove   GarbageCollectionMonitor.generation2Subscriptions,                                                                                                                     value                                                  ltsummarygt          Constructs the garbage collection monitor type          ltsummarygt         static GarbageCollectionMonitor                      GarbageCollectionMonitor.syncLock  new object               Construct a detector object                           N.B.

A local reference to the subscriptions delegate is required because                  this method is run on the finalizer thread which is started AFTER the                  garbage collector has finished running. As a result it is likely that                  the application threads that were frozen by the garbage collector will                  have been thawed. Since delegates are immutable, by getting a local                  reference the processing of the subscriptions is made threadsafe as any                  attempt by another thread to asynchronously add or remove a subscription                  will result in a separate new delegate being constructed.                   Determine if any event subscriptions need to be invoked                                   N.B. If a local reference were not used then there would be a risk of                  the following                                   1 The null reference inequality check yields a true result.                  2 The finalizer thread is paused.                  3 Another thread removes all subscriptions to the event causing the                  subscriptions delegate to be replaced with a null reference.                  4 The finalizer thread is unpaused.                  5 The attempt to invoke the subscriptions delegate results in a null                  reference exception being thrown.                 if subscriptions  null                                       Invoke the event                     subscriptions.Invoke   this,                                             EventArgs.Empty                                              codepre  pIt seems to work well but when testing it with the following code...p  precode    private void Gen0GarbageCollected  object sender,                                         System.EventArgs e              Console.WriteGen0    GC.CollectionCount0  Environment.NewLine           private void Gen1GarbageCollected  object sender,                                         System.EventArgs e              Console.WriteGen1    GC.CollectionCount1  Environment.NewLine           private void Gen2GarbageCollected  object sender,                                         System.EventArgs e              Console.WriteGen2    GC.CollectionCount2  Environment.NewLine      codepre  p...I get the following resultsp  precode    Gen0    1     Gen0    2     Gen1    1     Gen0    3     Gen0    4     Gen1    2     Gen2    1     Gen0    5     Gen1    3     Gen2    2     Gen0    7     Gen0    8     Gen0    9     Gen1    4     Gen0    10     Gen0    11     Gen0    12     Gen1    5     Gen2    3     Gen0    14     Gen0    15     Gen0    16     Gen1    6     Gen0    17 codepre  pIt seems that not all garbage collections are triggering the finalization thread. In this example the 6th and 13th collections of generation 0 are not raising events.p  pNow finally comes the question.p  pIm baffled by this and need to understand why it is happening. My reasoning is that since there is no guarantee when the finalizer thread will run it is possible that multiple garbage collections of any generation may occur between instances of the finalizer thread being run.p  pIf this is the case then the only guarantee that can be given is that if an event is raised then a garbage collection of that generation has taken place since the last time the event was raised.p  pThats the best I can come up with but I would really appreciate if someone with more knowledge of garbage collection internals could confirm if it is correct and I dont have huge implementation error in my solution.p  pThanks for bearing with me.p

Negative 2035 pI just ran some random tests on my code and was shocked to discover that codegetbrowsercode read Opera as Google Chrome.p  pA few months ago getbrowser gave me correct results on all 5 browsers chrome,ie,ff,opera,safari.p  pToday Opera displayed the same values with Google Chrome. First I thought getbrowser must be the problem so I tried getting alternatives. I saw this a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions2400935browserdetectioninjavascriptanswer2401861javascript alternativea which works BUT like getbrowser it also detected Opera as Google Chrome.p  pI made a quick search on this and found articles of Opera now using Chromium for its Desktop Browser.p  pIs that why my code is giving Opera and Google Chrome the same valuesp  pI store user information for better user experience and it looks bad when my users are being told the wrong information.p  pAny ideas on how to keep individuality between Google Chrome and Operap  pAll I can think of is using the useragent but it can be faked.p

Negative 2035 pSo i released an app and all seemed fine. All of a sudden I got reviews in and emails that he app did not function and was doing weird things. Turns out the users were using iPhone 4s and 5. I have an iphone 4 running 6.1.3 and everything worked great. As i did some testing in xcode i found using iPhone sim with 3.5 inch screen everything worked perfect. If I switched to the 4 inch retina display it went crazy... button functions from other screens mixed in with current view. Long story short... I went in and fixed it and ran tests using the simulator. all my tools are updated and everything looks good. I released update to iTunes so everyone who had issues could now use the app.p  pBut... a couple people i have been speaking with say the issues are still there. I do not understand how since I test in the simulator. Does anyone know how to properly test an app on the any version iOS and if it works on the sim it will work on an actual device. I am completely baffled by this issue. p  pI am using xcode 4.6.2 with iOS SDK 6.1 and my app deployment target is 4.3p

Negative 2035 pI already looked all around StackOverflow and Google to find a solution to this question but so far no luck. Got a HTML page with dynamically rendered content from Django. All works good with standard text and images, however from time to time it also shows HTML5 Video element which in screenshot appears as a black image and thats it. Adding poster to it did not help. Does anyone know is it somehow possible to actually take screenshot of html5 video element not flash etc If not, my 2nd approach was to create a js variable with html content inside and then replace video with image created from poster attribute of the video. After that send that js variable to html2canvas for screenshot. Reason for this is I CANT alter page look and feel for user so I need to do this stuff in the background somehow. Idea was to usep  precodevar content  .content.html content.replacevideo, image   pseudo here for sake of question html2canvascontent,  ... codepre  pHowever this only keeps giving me codeUncaught TypeError Cannot read property images of undefinedcode so that idea fails...

Negative 2035 pWhen I create a new instance in GCE Im able to ssh to that new instance without an issue.  gcutil checks to see if I have the keys googlecomputeengine and if not, it will create them for me.  It will then push the keys to the instance and will pause for five minutes to ensure the keys are placed there.  Again, this all works smoothly on a new instance that I create.  This also tells me that my ssh works.  p  pHowever, when trying to connect to another instance that already exists using gcutil project ssh , it produces Permission Denied publickey.  I removed the keys and reran the command and same error.  The expected result would be like above  i.e create keys and push them to the instance.  But this doesnt happen.p  pssh vvv has no useful info.  varlogauth.log doesnt even show an attempted connection.  p  pAnyone in GCE worldssh have any idea why gcutil works so smoothly for one instance but not for the other  What should I check for debugging thisp  pThanks in advance.p

I explicitly call the two constructors. The second block of code, there is the A constructor that gets called when you create the object rp  precode A rx  rhs.x codepre  ol liNow when the A destructor gets called here is it because r goes out of scope Which means that the destructor is called from within the A operator overloadli ol  pThen the 3rd block of output code. The constructor B gets called on this line of code.p  precode return Bx  rhs.x codepre  ol liNow my biggest question is why does the B destructor get called twice here Where does it get called from main or the B operator overload li ol
Negative 2035 pI have this app with a common activity and several different fragments replaced into the same layout ID codeR.id.contentcodep  pSome of the fragments are normal support.v4.Fragment and some are from v4.DialogFragmentp  pOn tablets, DialogFragments are shown as Dialogs and on phones theyre normally included in the codeR.id.contentcodep  pSo usually if I want to find out which fragment is current, its easy to callp  precodegetSupportFragmentManager.findFragmentByIdR.id.content codepre  pbut the DialogFragments issued are Dialogs are not on the codeR.id.contentcode, AFAIK theyre not even in the same Window. p  pSo the question is is there any framework level way to locate the dialog fragments I mean, is there a way to do it without having to manually keeping reference of Fragments or their tags p

Negative 2035 pstrongScenariostrongp  pAs a user I am able to take an unlimited amount of photos and videos which are stored in the apps documents folder.

After termination of the loop the program prints the amount of numbers that was entered.emp  pThe issue I have is that once I type in a valid number between 10100 the program sits still, it doesnt terminate nor loop.

Negative 2035 pI am developing an Android app. Please see the Java code below. Can you please explain why textView doesnt update at specific lines in code but updates at others. I have them commented in the code.p  pI have updated the code see below.  The idea is to get a facebook profile from a server. When profilingstatus equals 2 means that the profile is not ready, so Ill just ping the server until I get profilingstatus  2..  I tried the progress dialog thingy but gave up cause I put my activity in a thread, but then I couldnt get some information because I should have run it in nonUIThread.. Tried that but I failed and I lost patience.. so decided that while I ping the server I should just print Loading profile. Please wait. No mess, no fuss Only as said, textView doesnt update. Interestingly enough.. System.out.printlnHere gets executed. I am running it only on AVD at the moment cause the server is not on the wireless network so I cant use a mobile phone to test it. p  precodepublic class SelectionFragment extends Fragment       private ProfilePictureView profilePictureView     private TextView userNameView     private UiLifecycleHelper uiHelper     private static final int REAUTHACTIVITYCODE  100     private TextView textView     private String username  null     Context context     JSONObject json  null     JSONObject jsonfacebook  null     int time  0     int timeinterval  3000     int profilingstatus  2     String logincode     String usermessage  null      Override     public void onCreateBundle savedInstanceState          super.onCreatesavedInstanceState         uiHelper  new UiLifecycleHelpergetActivity, callback         uiHelper.onCreatesavedInstanceState            Override     public void onActivityResultint requestCode, int resultCode, Intent data          super.onActivityResultrequestCode, resultCode, data         if requestCode  REAUTHACTIVITYCODE              uiHelper.onActivityResultrequestCode, resultCode, data                    private Session.StatusCallback callback  new Session.StatusCallback          Override         public void callfinal Session session, final SessionState state, final Exception exception              onSessionStateChangesession, state, exception                    private void deleteProfile throws JSONException          IDThiefHTTPRequest.deleteProfile         textView.setTextColorColor.GRAY         textView.setGravityGravity.CENTER         textView.setTextPress Get profile info button to process your risk of identity theft          Facebook logout         Session session2  Session.getActiveSession         if session2  null              session2.close                  else              session2  new Sessioncontext             Session.setActiveSessionsession2             session2.close                    private String readRiskScoreArrayJSONArray jsonriskscore throws NumberFormatException, JSONException          get the risk score with only two digits          double riskscore  Double.valueOfjsonriskscore.get0.toString         String riskscore2digits  new DecimalFormat..formatriskscore          String usermessage  Your risk score is          usermessage  usermessage  riskscore2digits         usermessage  usermessage   which is ranked as          usermessage  usermessage  jsonriskscore.get2.toString          JSONArray jsonreasons  jsonriskscore.getJSONArray1          for int i  0 i lt jsonreasons.length i             JSONArray jsonreason  jsonreasons.getJSONArrayi             JSONArray jsonreasondetails  jsonreason.getJSONArray1             usermessage  usermessage  nnReason              usermessage  usermessage  jsonreasondetails.get0             usermessage  usermessage  nnIDThief suggests you to              usermessage  usermessage  jsonreasondetails.get1             usermessage  usermessage  nnFix it through this linkn             usermessage  usermessage  jsonreasondetails.get2                   return usermessage            private void displayProfileInfo throws JSONException         Session session  Session.getActiveSession       if session.isOpened              System.out.printlnsession.getAccessToken              if username  null            System.out.printlnLogin stage Getting profile info for user  username           logincode  username    session.getAccessToken            json  IDThiefHTTPRequest.makeLoginHTTPRequestlogincode           System.out.printlnjson.toString4           jsonfacebook  json.getJSONObjectfacebook           profilingstatus           profilingstatus  Integer.valueOfjsonfacebook.getprofilingstatus.toString            if profilingstatus  2                 try                    while profilingstatus  2 ampamp time lt 100000                        textView.setTextColorColor.BLACK                      textView.setGravityGravity.NOGRAVITY                      textView.setTextLoading profile.

Negative 2035 pOk, I am not sure about this question so sorry in advance if I am wrong putting it here. So I want to create a simulation of a data center using ns2 where I will compare different protocols in 2 metrics.p  pI am reading the tutorial for ns2 and found some extra material on the Internet and I found some papers to also read that might give me an insight on how to go about simulations though from a first overview I dont think so but I would like to know if anyone can direct me towards with more solid examples with some explanations if possible in more complex networks prefereably data centersp  pThe ns2 tutorial only covers the basics. I know that I will have to decide before hand what topology to use for my data center I am currently between a typical 3 layer data center topology and BCube, mainly because I am curious about a certain topology benefiting a specific protocol but not making a difference in another. Based on that I will have to build it in the tcl files. Then I know that somehow I will have to feed it a workload which I assume is a schedule of action simulating traffic but I am not clear on how this is done. In the tutorial they only have the at cases which are pretty straightforward but dont see a way to help me in my case. I assume I will also have to maybe set the routing scheme but...p  pSo this is what I have on my head so far. Clearly, I am little lost so any help would be appreciated.

Negative 2035 pI have created a for loop that loops the number of times that an element appears in a container. The for loop grabs some data from the HTML and creates a JSON url which will then return a value. That value should then be added to the HTML in the appropriate place.p  pThe problem seems that the for loop completes before all of the Ajax calls are made, so only the last value is being added to the HTML.

Negative 2035 pI created a basic OOTB document library to store Word and PDF files. I have been tasked to also create a few columns to store some basic metadata about the uploaded documents, for example AuthorFirstName, AuthorLastName, and a column that lists topics discussed in the document.p  pWhile I am generally familiar with most Document Library settings, and creating columns, I am seeking information on what column datatype might work best for topics. In most situations, one uploaded document would have 14 topics.p  pI would rather the datatype not be a codesingle line of textcode datatype, as I would rather not ask the user to separate the different values topics using a delimiter such as a comma or semicolon. I would like to offer users the option to sort or filter in the SharePoint views. p  pThere also seem to be some limitations with the codeChoicecode datatype.  While codeChoicecode fields seem to support FillIn Values, when a choice is not prepopulated, they only seem to allow 1 fillin. I would like the user to able to use a repeatingtablelike interface to add a topic, and click an add button, and repeat, and so on.p

Negative 2035 pI currently have a large form that utilized the nestedform gem and I would like to add the functionality that on the update function it saves a pdf of the form to AWSs S3. p  pCurrently I have implemented the PDFKit Gem and have the ability to generate a pdf by simply adding the .pdf extension to the path. For example. p  precodeuser2form2  lt nestedformforuser,form do f gt   .....   lt f.fieldsfor images do igt   .....   lt end gt lt end gt codepre  pand user2form2.pdf renders a pdf. p  pI have attempted to implement this functionality using Carrierwave to create a hidden remoteimageurl field and upload the .pdf remotely to s3 but this causes a timeout because the form is too large. I have attempted to use CarrierwaveDirect but from what I can tell there is no way to use the directformfor within the nestedformfor so I am unsure if I can implement the direct upload functionality. p  pI have begun exploring options using the AWS SDK for Ruby to just create a background process that could happen on save. However, I am struggling to find a methodology that allows me to save the file from the remote location. p  pAre there any alternatives that I have not yet considered Any recommendations or guidance would be greatly appreciated. p  pEDITp  pI am operating on Heroku which prevents the simplicity of just saving the file on the server.

Sometimes, Im too lazy to do all this, but I want to gain administrator privileges while in Bash.

Negative 2035 pPlease keep in mind that I am a complete novice to all of this so if you have several face palm moments while reading this do not think that I am trying to troll you. p  pI recently started reading Hacking The Art of Exploitation by Jon Erickson. In the book he has the following function, which I will refer to as Ap  precode int factorial int x .......... 1                       .......... 2   int i               .......... 3   for i1 i ltx i .......... 4       x i           .......... 5   return x            .......... 6                       .......... 7               codepre  pThis particular function is on pg. 17. Up until this function, I have understood everything he has described. To be fair, he has explained all of the elements within A in detail, with the exception of the return concept. However, I just dont see how A is suppose to describe the process of x  x  x1  x2  x3,etc which I will refer to as B. If someone could take the time to break this down in detail I would really appreciate it. Since I am asking for your help, I will go through the elements I believe I understand in order to potentially expose elements I believe I understand but actually do not but also to help you help me make the leap from how A is suppose to be a representation of B. p  pOk, so here is what I believe I understand. p  pIn line 1, in int x x is being assigned the type integer. What I am less sure about is whether in factorial int x, int x is being assigned the type factorial, or if even factorial is a type. Oh god, there is probably someone rolling on the floor, dying of laughter right now. p  pLine 3 is simplei is being assigned the type integer. p  pLine 4 I am less confident on but I think I have a decent grasp of it. Im assuming line 4 is a while control structure with a counter. In the first segment, the counter is referred to as i and its initial value is established as 1. I believe the second segment of line 4, i lt x, dictates that while counter i is less than x, keep looping. The third segment, i, communicates that for every valid loopiteration of this while a, then b situation, you add 1 to i. p  pIn line 5 I believe that xi is suppose to be shorthand for i  x but if I didnt know that this function is suppose to explain the process of calculating a factorial, I wouldnt be able to organically explain how lines 4 and 5 are suppose to interact.  p  pThough the combination of lines 4 and 5 are my penultimate wtf moment, I truly arrive at destination mind fuck when I am told that lines 17 are suppose to represent the process of calculating a factorial, so once again, I humbly ask for your help. For any one who helps me get over this hump, I thank you in advance. p

I have also used headerssent to ensure that headers havent already been sent prior to setting the cookie and returning the response.

Negative 2035 pFor a Ruby project I need an OpenCPU server to process some statistics by R packages. OpenCPU has an JSON REST API, so with Ruby I can easily hook into that to communicate with R. So far, so good.p  pOne of those packages has a strange at least to me syntax.p  precodeadd lt function.argument1, .argument2    return.argument1  .argument2  codepre  pSo this is just an example, not the actual function. The part I found weird are those points in front of parameters. When I suggested to remove those points, the developer of the package said that it was meant to hide the variables from the overview of variables in IDE RStudio. It sounds to me like he wanted to make the parameters, what we call it, private, or at least to scope it somehow. I searched the internets to explain this feature of R, but found nothing.p  pThe actual problem is we use Ruby, Ruby translates data into JSON and sends it to OpenCPU. OpenCPU looks up for the right packagefunction, passes arguments and executes it. Then it returns to OpenCPU which makes a JSON response. Rubys 1.9 Hash syntax that we prefer to work with looks likep  precode argument1 4, argument2 3 .tojson  gt  argument1 4, argument2 3  codepre  pinstead of older forced by the package argumentsp  precode .argument1 gt 4, .argument2 gt 3 .tojson  gt  .argument1 4, .argument2 3  codepre  pSo in desperate search for an argument to convince the Rdeveloper not to use the dots, my question was still unanswered does this point in front of the parameters have a real functionality in R or is it just a hack to exclude the variables from the IDEp

On the other hand, there are ways to convert a base 10 integer to a binary number, e.g. codebin2codep  pI wonder if I could combine this two, I mean there are no bitwise operators on strings, therefore, codebin8  bin10code only throws an error. I guess when using bitwise operators on integers, Pythons first step is always a conversion anyways.p  pActually I was thinking how I could speed up operations like codea  bcode when both a and b are high values of integers and there are many bitwise operations on them. Conversion takes too much time so Id like to just convert them in the first place and manipulating with bitwise operators only after.  Maybe converting each number to bool lists could help, but Im interested if anyone has a better idea.p  pThank you very much for any good advicesp

Maybe there is a better way to do thisp  pHeres is what my tableview wiring looks like...p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comilUL4.gif altenter image description herep  pHere is the wiring for the recognizer...p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.com5KWis.gif altenter image description herep  pHere is my tap handler, which when wired up, fires fine when the user selects an item.p  precode IBActiontapHandlerUITapGestureRecognizer sender      if sender.state  UIGestureRecognizerStateEnded          tapPosition  [sender locationInViewself.view]       codepre  pHere is the didselectrowAtIndexPath method.

Negative 2035 pI have a multithreaded Java program which is getting memory consistency errors. Ive naively tried to solve the problem by declaring all my variables volatile and methods synchronized, but that has not worked.  p  pSometimes, the memory from the previous object shows up in other new objects.

Negative 2035 pIve searched around and can only find some very vague documentation on my question. p  pWhat I am wondering isp  pSay you have a Mobile app that you are wanting to use mobile Google analytics to track users. Say its a ecommerce site and therefore you have a product screen named products. p  pThis is not ideal for someone that wants to find the top products on their mobile app...as the screen name is simply Products. p  pIdeally you would want the actual product name in the screen views section of Google Analytics. The problem with this though is that it will look ugly across the top of the actual screen. Currently it says products across the top of the screen.p  pNow for the questionp  pIs there a way to pass the actual product name as the screen name but still present Product at the top of the screen when a user is viewing the app p  pIf so..I would love to know how so I can relay to my developer. p
Negative 2035 pI have a list of of data being return from a standard HttpGet IQueryable method from an ApiController that implements the Breeze EFContextProvider.

However this means the caches and TLB are flushed. Writeback requests go to the main memory.

Negative 2035 pI have created a page which allows clients to change the background color. For example, 5 background colors are offered to be chosen and some buttons are made for changing the background color. The server will save what background color the clients chose in the database so that they will see the background color they chose without any setting when they visit the page again. When the client clicks the button, a AJAX request will send to the server and the PHP script will query and update a row in the database to record the choice of the client.p  pActually, I have done the page and nothing goes wrong if the client does not change the background color so frequently. For example, if I click to change from red to blue to green to white in 4 seconds evenly, the 3 changes are recognized and finally the white will be saved in the database. However, if I do that again in a very period, say, less than 1 second, I find that some updates failed. In details, I check it by if codestmtgtaffectedrowscode returns 0 and, for instance, it may show the updates corresponding to green and white has affected rows 0.p  pIf some updates failed, the last background color the client chose may not be saved. Also, it is strange to limit how fast the client can change the background. Hence, I wonder the reasons cause the problem.p  pDoes it reach fastest update frequency Or, is it because the last update is still writing the data and locking the row Can MySQL receive the update queries and make them into a queue, and process them sequentiallyp

Negative 2035 pIm selfstudying C and doing an exercise that, among other things, asks me to sort a list of userentered strings by length of the first word in the string. The other functions in the exercise including sorting the string by entire length were easy to write. Ive been working on this one for over three hours and cant get it to work. Im sorting an array of pointerstochar, and then printing them with a for loop in the main function.p  pTheres probably a much easier way to do this, but even if so, I cannot understand why this function doesnt work.

Negative 2035 pFor my dissertation strongdata collectionstrong, one of the sources is an externallymanaged system, which is based on Web form for submitting emSQL queriesem. Using codeRcode and codeRCurlcode, I have implemented an automated data collection framework, where I simulate the abovementioned form.

Negative 2035 pI have a directed graph G with N vertices, k of which are labeled terminal. I want to label each vertex v with the set of terminal vertices that are reachable from v. Can I do this in space RrN, where R is the average number of terminal vertices reachable from the nodes of G, and r is a small constantp  pTo make this more concrete, the data structure would look roughly like thisp  precodestruct Node   bool isTerminal  True if this is a terminal node   vectorltNodegt successors  return the successors of this node   setltNodegt reachableterminals the value to compute   bool done initially false  codepre  pWe want a functionp  precodevoid setreachablesvectorltNodegt amp  the amp means pass by reference in C codepre  pThat takes a vector of Node representing the vertices in G and sets the reachableterminals member of each Node in G to the terminals reachable from that node.p  pTo make it concrete, N is about 100,000,00 and k is about 150. The average branching factor is about 3 and only about 1000 vertices at the very most are reachable from any particular vertex. At most ten terminal vertices are typically reachable from any  v.p  pNow, if G were acyclic, a simple depthfirst search would work. Its the cycles that cause issues. Also, if space were not a problem I could compute and store the predecessors of each node and then work backward from the terminal nodes, but this takes too much space note that the successors of a node v are not stored with v but are computed on the fly as necessary, and I would prefer not to have to compute codesuccessorscode more than once per node.p  pI am using C, but any algorithm description is fine.p  pEdit Note that DFS for the acyclic case works using an algorithm like thisp  precodevoid setreachablesvectorltNodegtampv    forauto amp nodev node.visit   setltNodegt Nodevisit   if node.isTerminal reachableTerminals.insertthis   if done return reachableTerminals   forautoampnodesuccessors     reachableTerminalssetunionreachableTerminals,node.visit   donetrue   return reachableTerminals  codepre  pObviously, this algorithm will fail if the graph is cyclic.p

Negative 2035 pFor testing purposes, I provide my own implementation of the codenowcode function which is codepublic.nowcode. Using codesearchpathcode to override the default codepgcatalog.nowcode with my own version mostly works, but I have a table with a table with a default expression of codenowcode.  Showing the table produces something akin to the followingp  precode startdate    date     not null default now codepre  pHowever, after a schema save and restore to a testing DB, the same show table producesp  precode startdate    date     not null default pgcatalog.now codepre  pI assume from this, initially the function in the default expression is not bound to any schema and the searchpath will be used to find the correct one.

Negative 2035 pI have an app which displays a ListView from SQLite database content. When I click on one of the items in the ListView, I post a message to my JNI thread and try to do a DELETE command on a table thats in the same database but its a completely different table to what has been access by the ListView.p  pUnfortunately the sqlite3finalize call fails with an error code of 1 SQLERROR.p  pI suspect this is because the database has been opened or is still open by the SimpleCursorAdapter. Would this be the casep  pThe DELETE statement itself works perfectly when I try it in Firefoxs SQLiteManager where I test all my SQLite statements on a copy of the database. UPDATE commands seem to work OK as do any SELECT commands  its just the DELETE that isnt working.p  pDo I somehow need to manually close the SimpleCursorAdapters cursor when it has finished displaying the rows Im using a LoaderManager to maintain the data content.p  pHeres the JNI execution codep  precodeBOOL ExecuteSQL char pszSQL     sqlite3stmt pStmt   int           rc    rc  sqlite3preparev2 gMainDB,                             pszSQL,                             1,                             amppStmt,                             0    int nFailStep  0    if rc  SQLITEOK      rc  sqlite3step pStmt    else     nFailStep  1    if rc  SQLITEOK      rc  sqlite3finalize pStmt    else     nFailStep  2    if  rc  SQLITEOK    rc  SQLITEDONE       return TRUE   else     nFailStep  3    LogDebugf ExecuteSQL rc d s nFailStep dn, rc, sqlite3errstr rc , nFailStep     return FALSE  codepre  pIt fails withp  precodeExecuteSQL rc 1 SQL logic error or missing database nFailStep 3 codepre

Negative 2035 pIm reading the book Java 8 Lambdas, and at some point the author says Its a good idea to use the primitive specialized functions wherever possible because of the performance benefits..p  pHe is referring here to mapToInt, mapToLong, etc.p  pThe thing is I dont know where the performance comes from to be honest.p  pLets consider an examplep  precode     Consider this a very very long list, with a lot of elements     ListltIntegergt list  Arrays.asList1, 2, 3, 4      sum it, flavour 1     int sum1  list.stream.reduce0, acc, e gt acc  e.intValue      sum it, flavour 2     int sum2  list.stream.mapToInte gt e.sum      System.out.printlnsum1     sum2 codepre  pSo, in the first case I use reduce to sum the values, so the BinaryOperator function will receive all the time an int  acc  and an Integer  the current element of the collection  and then will do an unboxing of the Integer to the int  acc  ep  pIn the second case, I use mapToInt, which unboxes each Integer into an int, and then sums it.p  pMy question is, is there any advantage of the second approach Also whats the point of map to int, when I could have used mapp  pSo yeah, is it all just sugar syntax or does it has some performance benefits In case it does, please offer some informationp  pRegards,p

Negative 2035 pI am using theano.scan for creating stacked vector of contexts like thisp  precodeY, scanupdates  theano.scanfnlambda args,kwargs T.concatenateargs, axis0,outputsinfoNone, sequencesdictinput  Y, tapsrangeleftctx,rightctx1 codepre  pIt seems that scan is so slow, that this slows down whole processing.  In signal processing this is fairly standard operation, so I was thinking about creating a special op, just for this.  Unfortunately, I would need also GPU implementation and grad for this op and it looks like a long shot for me.  Can you kick me in the right direction I have already read Extending theano documentation, but still doesnt help a lot.p  pExamplep  pin case of p  precodeleftctxrightctx1 codepre  pmatrixp  precode[[0.0, 0.1],  [1.0, 1.1],  [2.0, 2.1],  [3.0, 3.1]] codepre  pwould be converted to p  precode[[0.0, 0.1, 1.0, 1.1, 2.0, 2.1],  [1.0, 1.1, 2.0, 2.1, 3.0, 3.1]] codepre  pThank you Jp
Negative 2035 psuppose I have a link with say blue color. When I click it its turned to red by avisited property in css. Now even if I refresh the original page where the link was originaly present then also I am getting the color of a link as visited. I know that this is because visited works on the basis of browsers history. Is there any other method by which the visited links color can be revert back as unvisited after refreshing the page.

Negative 2035 pGoing through Herbert Schildt  The Complete Reference Chapter 10 Exception Handlingp  blockquote   pException handling provides a powerful mechanism for controlling complex programs that       have many dynamic runtime characteristics. It is important to think of try, throw, and catch       as clean ways to handle errors and unusual boundary conditions in your programs logic.       Unlike some other languages in which error return codes are used to indicate failure, Java       uses exceptions. Thus, when a method can fail, have it throw an exception. This is a cleaner       way to handle failure modes.       One last point Javas exceptionhandling statements should not be considered a general       mechanism for nonlocal branching. If you do so, it will only confuse your code and make it       hard to maintain.p blockquote  pWhat does he mean by the term nonlocal branching Kindly elaborate with the help of a nice examplep  pNote this question was asked on coderanch, but the answers there were primarily based on individual     opinions and as such it didnt yield a rootbased answer I wasnt able to clarify the point with the discussions over there.p

Negative 2035 pI am creating an app that should show a message when you are on a specific location. Everything worked fine as long as you keep the app open. But now that I use services nothing happens. LocationChanged is not even called in the services.

Ive asked a question before and they told me to use services. Ive implemented the services from the tutorial what Ive understood from it but it doesnt work when the app is running in the background.

Negative 2035 pIm creating a test video chat app with WebRTC. I have two peers connected successfully. I would like to add a way for a user to reconnect disconnect and connect with another user. For testing purposes the other user is the same user as before. So, when a button is selected this code is calledp  precodesenduserId, toUserId, disconnect true pc.removeStreamlocalStream pc.close pc  new PeerConnectionservers, options remoteVideo.src   codepre  pIn the above code, using the signaling method, one message is sent to the other user to alert them to disconnect. Then, the local stream is removed from the peer connection, the connection is closed, new PeerConnection is created, and the remote video is set to blank while the other video is being loaded. After that I have some code that finds another user to connect to the same user for testing cases and proceed to negotiate follows the same code that worked before for the negotiation.p  pUsing logging, it seems that every step is reached offeranswericecandidate. The problem is that the onaddstream listener is never reached. Yes, pc.addStream is called before an offer is sent.

Negative 2035 pI have a app a app that allows users to rapidly send photos to each other , but as we all know users dont always have a perfect internet connection so we decided to create a system that would temp store all the photos in a directory and info for each api request in a array of dictionaries. If a user takes 2 photos to send and the first one fails due to no connection and then a few minutes later the user takes a 3rd photo when they have a internet connection this is what happens pseudo  , but we get some repeats and weird things happening doing it this way if the queue starts to get backed up and this whole process is being triggered multiple times. So we did some research and dispatchgroups seems to be the answer, but we cant figure out how we can use the same dispatch group each time so that there are not multiple dispatch group queues all firing the same requests at the same time if a user takes 20 pictures really fast. p  pAnother important part of this system is that it must MUST upload in the same order all the images were taken and should ideally avoid any duplication p  precodevoiduploadNSStringtypeOfUpload        [resendBtn setHiddenYES]     NSUserDefaults defaults  [NSUserDefaults standardUserDefaults]     NSMutableArray pendingRequests[[NSMutableArray alloc] init]      NSString pendingRequestsFrom [NSString stringWithFormatpendingRequestsForUid,[defaults objectForKeyuid]]     NSLogPENDINGREQUESTFROM,pendingRequestsFrom       if [defaults objectForKeypendingRequestsFrom]         pendingRequests [[defaults objectForKeypendingRequestsFrom]mutableCopy]               NSMutableDictionary requestDict[[NSMutableDictionary alloc] init]     NSDate now  [NSDate date]     int timestamp  [[NSDate date] timeIntervalSince1970]     [requestDict setObject[NSString stringWithFormatd,timestamp] forKeytimestamp]      ifconvertedVideoURL         NSStringurlPath [convertedVideoURL path]         [requestDict setObjecturlPath forKeyvideoURL]           if[typeOfUpload isEqualToStringPHOTO]           Get image data.

Negative 2035 pI implemented a view controller that simply displays a single image and allows the user to pinch to zoom inpan around the image. It works great on iOS 7, but on iOS 8 the scroll views frame is a different size, and the end result is the image is zoomed in too far on iPhone and zoomed out too far on iPad when running on iOS 8. This is because the scroll view frames width is 600pt, which is its size in the storyboard Universal Storyboard using size classes. But I have autolayout constraints that are supposed to ensure the scroll view stretches to fill the available space  it should be 768pt on iPad. That is the case on iOS 7 but not iOS 8.p  pThis is the setup In Interface Builder, I have a codeUIViewControllercode that contains a codeUIViewcode which contains a codeUIScrollViewcode with autolayout contraints trailing, leading, bottom, and top space to the superview. Then in codeviewDidLoadcodep  precode    UIImage image  [UIImage imageNamedimage]     self.imageView  [[UIImageView alloc] initWithImageimage]     self.imageView.contentMode  UIViewContentModeScaleAspectFit     self.imageView.frame  CGRectMake0, 0, self.imageView.image.size.width, self.imageView.image.size.height      [self.scrollView addSubviewself.imageView]     self.scrollView.contentSize  image.size      warning Bug here  scroll view frame is 600pt on iOS 8  should be 768 for iPad     NSLogscroll view frame wid f, self.scrollView.frame.size.width codepre  pI discovered if I put that same codeNSLogcode in codeviewDidAppearcode the frames width is correctly 768pt. I tried moving that code into codeviewWillAppearcode instead of codeviewDidLoadcode, but I get the same outcome  its 600 in codeviewWillAppearcode as well. So the scroll view is properly stretching to fill the display but not until after it appears on screen. I need the correct frame size before the image appears on screen so that I may calculate the proper min and max zoom values.p  pWhat can I do to fix that and ensure it works for iOS 7 and 8p
Negative 2035 pIt is straightforward to read the expected fields no matter optional or not and validate them, but I fail on how to throw an exception properly if an unexpected field is detected in the given json.

Negative 2035 pHow do you get CSS to scale down two absolute positioned images, sidebyside, within their own div but inside a parent wrapperp  pI have looked at many stackoverflow questions, but could not find an answer for how to deal with two or more images. I have tried multiple CSS examples but to no avail.p  pI put together a mock example that simulates what Im trying to do. See a hrefhttpwww.netplayhockey.comtest.php relnofollowhttpwww.netplayhockey.comtest.phpa. Please note that there is a reason the images are different widths and in their own div has to do with some absolute text positioning that I removed for this demo.p  pThe page width is 1024px image1 598px, image2 426px. If you reduce the width of the browser, I would like both images to scale down. But, instead, the images do not change size. In fact, image2 overlaps image1.p  pIts doing what I want when browser width is less than 600px I picked 600px as an example, I really want this to occur for mobile but not iPad, I want image2 to move under image1. And the images to be centered. p  pNote If I use relative positioning and float, I dont get the desired centering results the images stack when screen is less than 1024px, and they dont center.p  pAttached is the HTML and CSSp  precodeltDOCTYPE html PUBLIC W3CDTD XHTML 1.0 StrictEN httpwww.w3.orgTRxhtml1DTDxhtml1strict.dtdgt lthtml xmlnshttpwww.w3.org1999xhtmlgt ltheadgt ltmeta httpequivContentType contenttexthtml charsetutf8 gt lttitlegtlttitlegt ltlink hreftest.css relstylesheet typetextcss gt ltheadgt ltbodygt ltdiv classcontainergt     ltdiv classfooterwrappergt         ltdiv classfootergt             ltdiv classfooterleftgtltimg srcimage1.png gtltdivgt             ltdiv classfooterrightgtltimg srcimage2.png gtltdivgt         ltdivgt     ltdivgt ltdivgt ltbodygt lthtmlgt  body      positionrelative     background999      margin0     padding0  .container      positionrelative     maxwidth1024px                margin0 auto  .footerwrapper      positionrelative  .footer                     positionrelative  .footerleft            positionabsolute     left0  .footerright           positionabsolute     right0  .footer img      maxwidth100     textaligncenter     heightauto  media all and maxwidth600px        .footerleft            positionrelative         textaligncenter          .footerright          positionrelative         textaligncenter       codepre

Negative 2035 pBasically, Im at the point where Im ready to try just about any new approach to managing the complexity of the software projects I work on. I understand the OOP paradigm and its implementation in languages like C deeply. However, I find myself groping to get a mental handle on the sometimes overwhelming integrational complexity of my projects no matter how well I design or refactor my OOP model and abstractions, such complexity persists. p  pThe issue comes up mostly with software projects that involve all the following in one modulep  ul liLots of state managementli liState transitions conflated with pageformwindow transitionsli liKeeping remote server, memory, and local data in syncli ul  pI seek proven techniques and paradigms for dealing with such complexity where plain old OOP abstractions seem to fail. In particular, can Functional Programming F or State Machines help with thisp  pFor example I am developing a WinRT app, with numerous state transitions occuring between pages, and the need to keep in sync data from a server, data in memory, and locally saved data.p  pI am finding it difficult to abstract away various state and data management commands. For example After writing a command, I need to remember whether its state modification is memory only, or persisted to disk. I need to remember whether a page transition command prepares the data before navigating to a page, or whether the pages constructor should prepare the data. Basically, since my commands affect a lot of context, I need to know exactly what a commands does, how it affect the entire state of the app, in order to remember to use it properly. p  pFurthermore, due to the syncing requirements of the app, I have all sorts of issues with keeping straight in my head when I should use a serverdownloaded, memory, or locallydeserialized object, when I need to clone or copy property values from one to the other, etc.p  pPlease note that the problem is not a lack of skill or understanding of what code to write or how to design it. In order words, the issue is NOT algorithmic complexity or architectural challenges. The issue is about integrationcognitive complexity I find I must keep in mind all the countless implementation decisions I have made I am finding it difficult to abstract them away properly. There is too much state, context, transitions, and object reference management to deal with. p  pI could attempt write a huge number of classes and methods that do very specific things, each with a long name that specifies what it does and and exactly how it changes the application state, but that would impose a different sort of cognitive load on me.p  pWhich brings me to my original question are Functional Programming and  or State Machines or any other technique consistently good at helping manage such complexity I welcome proven techniques, with a clear explanation of how it might reduce complexity, and information on implementation, whether custom or with a frameworklanguagep

Negative 2035 pIm making a website for a restaurant at the moment and I need to store different things like menus, events, chef profiles etc. Im wondering is there any service or piece of software available that you set the information you want about something and the client can the create, update, and delete information accordingly without you making a bunch of custom forms. p  pFor example, you could say you want a tab called meals and say each meal has a name, photo, a list of ingredients and a list of local ingredients. The client would then fill out the form each time they decided to serve a new meal. You might also want a chef tab say, with name, photo, bio and specialities. You would the be able to access the data through a RESTful API or database directly or whatever. p  pI just want to be able to say what the information I want from client looks like. They createmodify it and then I can integrate it in a custom web site. Basically is there anything that creates user friendly CRUD forms automatically for you around a databasep

Negative 2035 pIm using an INPUT element as a search box. The first time you click it, the input moves up to make room for search results below it.p  pIn Safari on an ipad air in landscape mode, clicking the input also causes the keyboard to open, which pusesh the input up even further, to the point where its above the viewport and not visible to the user.p  pThe input is automagically repositioned by IOS though, as soon as the user starts typing on the keyboard the input is in focus at this point. Somehow a keyboard event causes IOS to reposition the input perfectly on the screen.

Negative 2035 pI am new to this forum so please excuse any missteps in my post. My post is also a little specific so I had difficulty location an answer already.p  pMy situation is presented in excel VBA and Ive been working to code a strategy that QAs Quality Assures information in one sheet against information in another sheet. Normally this could be accomplished by a standard if then statement but my problem herein lies with where the data is located. The two sheets are formatted quite differently with relevant data being in in different rows.p  pFor Example I cant use a large if then query because of...p  pSheet 1 contains rows withp  precodeX Data x Y Data y Z Data z codepre  pand sheet 2 would bep  precodeX Data x Y Data Y A Data A Z Data Z codepre  pSince I need this code to look at a very large selection of data with patterns similar to this repeating quite a few times, and the fact that I will need this code to work across multiple workbooks with similar issues is where the big problem exists.p  pFor my solutions to this problem I had a few ideasp  ul liIs it possible to select cells following a cell with a certain header in itli liSince these rows arent in the same location but they have the same heading could I QA the rows individuals values against each other This way my sheet that I put all of the passfails on will have the row title followed by whether the data matches up correctly.li liAnother idea I had would be to format rows with irrelevant information in them with a fill color, then do special filtering to filter those rows to the bottom, followed by a condition that allows all the rows in both sheets to match up. This idea I would be able to code and I know how to do, I just believe when I get in different workbooks in the future that this method wont be applicable to them.li ul  pI did not include any of my current code as what I have now pertains to formatting and just creating the general layout of the workbook. I havent started to code the if then statements either as I am baffled as to how to begin.p  pAs an aside my programming knowledge is quite new, Id rate myself a generous 5 out of 10 in programming skill. Any help or even ideas that may jumpstart this project will be greatly appreciated. Thank youp  pEDIT  p  precodeIFSheet2R[15]C[9]Sheet1R[1]C[5],Pass,Fail   codepre  pThis would be the ideal code to have checked across a range of cells. I would be multiplying this by close to 5000 rows and since the master Sheet2 contains rows that dont exist in what is being checked against Sheet1, so I cant simply enter this formula into a new sheet and drag down. I need to check it against some sort of developed criteria essentially if. p  pstrongPsuedocodestrongp  precodeIf worksheetSheet2Row 1 equals Bobs store then      If worksheetSheet1.row 1 equals Bobs store then         ifSheet2R[1]C[2]Sheet1R[1]C[2],Pass,Fail codepre  pI hope that clears this up a little.p

This can contribute   gigabytes to service logging and bring down the service with the   embedded ZK client and others.p blockquote  pSo I shut thrift and then Hbase, but now when I try to bring it back up it runs into this infinite loop. Is there any solution to bringing HBase back upbr Configs It is currently running in standalone mode, Hbasemanageszookeeper is set to true, this is Release 0.94.8 of HBase.  I also tried to manage the zookeeper separately from HBase and point zookeepers datadir to a different folder, but it seems the zxid problem still exists. p  pI know this is because the HBase server wont allow the system to go back in time marked by zxids, but it there any way to deal with this problem   p  pThanks. p

Negative 2035 pIm new to angular and am working on trying to rebuild a chrome extension into a generic webapp using angular just to learn it.p  pOne of the very first things the extension does is grab a specific cookie created by logging into a website in a browser tab using the command codechrome.cookies.getAllcode.  Is the angular equivalent to this just using the cookies service with codecookies.getAllcode It doesnt seem to be having the same effect when I test it, which is why I ask, so I apologize if this is a stupid question.

Negative 2035 pI have written an implementation of Bressenhams circle drawing algorithm. strongThis algorithms takes advantage of the highly symmetrical properties of a circlestrong it only computes points from the 1st octant and draws the other points by taking advantage of symmetry. Therefore I was expecting it to be very fast.

Negative 2035 pIm developing a SpriteKit game using Swift and Xcode 6.3. I want a sprite node to follow along a defined path. I also want the position of the node following the defined path to be relative to the, in this case y coordinate change, of the other node.img srchttpi.stack.imgur.com3iFQz.png altenter image description herep  pThe pink one is the one I move with my finger. Its path is from the origin to the horizontal pink line. If I drag it up 20 of its path I want the other two to move 20 in the same time. If I drag it back it will make the others go backwards on their path as well. The black dots represent this. Im sorry for not posting any code. I read about following a path in SpriteKit but nothing of what i found would have helped here. Thanks for your help.p

I have a couple of issues with the way I have implemented this form.p  ul liWhen the page first loads, there is no codeformData.titlecode property in the codescopecode, but since it is bound to the Title input text field, when I start typing a value, the codetitlecode property gets added to the codescopecode. However when I delete the value in the input text field, the codeformData.titlecode property still exists in the codescopecode as an empty string. I suppose this is okay, but I really want to clean up empty or null values when submitting the form. I would like to do it on the client side if it is easy to do so, so the server side code does not have to clean up anything.li liWith the dynamic emSubscribersem section, I can keep adding as many rows as I want, but ultimately, I would like to filter out all empty emsubscriberem objects on the client side.li ul  pDoes AngularJS have any options for detecting and cleaning nullempty values in the codescopecode before further processing, such as a codehttpcode POSTp  pstrongNotestrong I have set up a a hrefhttpsjsfiddle.netwebuser71ua6oj5e relnofollowjsFiddlea for this example.p

I also want to save and parse some information about the size of the map before the actual reading process happens. The map file should look much like thisp  precodeThis is a test map width4 height3 layercount1 tilesize32 [1000] [23100] [5010] codepre  pwhere layercount is the number of layers the zdimension offers. and tilesize is the size of every tile in pixels. Entities are defined in between the brackets. The pattern goes [entityidxposyposzpos]. I already wrote the code to parse a file like this but its not very flexible because you just have to put one tiny whitespace in front of the square brackets and the map cant load up. I just need some few helpful tips to do this in a flexible way. Can anybody help me outp

Server receives the data chunk, processes the data and sends it back to client where client will write the data in another output file.p  pstrongIssuestrong It works fine for small size files. When i am trying to send a large file i end up in data loss. The server resets the connection after a certain amount of data is transferred. The following exception occurs and the program stops.p  precodeorg.apache.tomcat.websocket.pojo.PojoEndpointBase onError  java.net.SocketException Connection reset   at

Negative 2035 pI created a number of TCP client  server applications in past, that were always using very simple text based protocols, either text messages separated by new line or Xml streams.p  pNow I am creating a simple protocol for a game server that would mostly exchange Vector information and handle some simple RPC calls with clients. Because its going to be a game server I really want to it to be super fast and lightweight. For this reason I decided to implement it as a binary protocol see a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions2525188arebinaryprotocolsdeadAre binary protocols deada for some more information on what I mean.p  pI have a rough idea how to do that, but before I start working on it I would like to confirm that this approach is actually going to work and if there isnt any better, commonly used one. I never implemented binary TCP protocols in past.p  pI am going to send all information in packets of information which I just call datagrams. Another important constant within the protocol is the size of floating point numbers in bytes, which I just call codeBLOCKSIZEcode. I am going to use multiple languages client will be C, while server is C and I need to make sure that all platforms x86, x64 will have same sized numbers within datagrams.p  pFirst information that server sends to client is going to be a single byte codesizeofcharcode containing the value of codeBLOCKSIZEcode just to make sure that floating point numbers I am using codedoublecode because its big enough for my purposes are going to take same amount of bytes on both server and client. Then a stream of datagrams follows until end of communication channel.p  pLayout of datagram isp  precodeSize in bytes  name                  Description BLOCKSIZE  type            Type of datagram for internal purposes I need to figure out what I am actually going to process  I could probably create header instead that would describe it in details, but for my purposes one double can contain all possible types I will use unsigned BLOCKSIZE  size   Length of datagram  number of bytes that will follow. I just hope I will never need to send a single datagram that would be bigger tham maximum value of unsigned double P size  data                  Data that are contained within datagram, I will process them based on what type they will be. codepre  pI suppose that for receiving I would just always create a buffer big as codesizecode announced by either side would be and keep pushing data into it, unless I get them all. And then I can start processing another datagram.p  pI believe this should work as long as client and server always send correct data with not a single byte being wrong, extra or missing. I dont know if TCP is reliable enough, or if I need to implement some error checking as well. I have no idea how.p  pI only need to transfer huge amount of arrays of floating point numbers, eventually some very simple strings, but I dont really need to care about that right away. Is this a right approach or should I do it in a different wayp

Negative 2035 pJHipster offers subgenerators for deploying applications to cloud providers such as Heroku and Openshift, but not for applications using MongoDB due to the fact that a hrefhttpsgithub.comjhipstergeneratorjhipsterissues733 relnofollowMongeez requires admin privilegesa which of course is not possible within a PaaS environment.p  pHowever, it should be possible to run JHipster  MongoDB on cloud providers as long as Mongeez is deactivated. I did the following using Herokup  ul liFirst, I manually exported the MongoDB database that was created by JHipster on my local development machine and imported it on a Mongolab instance.li liIn case the used profile is codeprodcode, Mongeez doesnt get instantiated.li liAfter some modifications to JHipsters a hrefhttpsgithub.comjhipstergeneratorjhipstertreemasterheroku relnofollowHeroku subgeneratora, it was possible to deploy the app to Heroku. The generator now ignores codeHerokuDatabaseConfiguration.javacode which is for JDBC and in the used Procfile, I changed the profile to codeprodcode instead of codeprod,herokucode and removed the parameter codespring.datasource.herokuurlDATABASEURLcode.li ul  pIt works quite well, but I have problems with injecting the MongoDB connection string. At the moment, the credentials are hardcoded into codeapplicationprod.ymlcode, so it would be necessary to redeploy the whole application in case of a change of the credentials. In another attempt, I added codespring.data.mongodb.uriMONGOLABURIcode to the Procfile, but there wasnt any effect unless I missed something. p  pSo how could I solve this issue As I said, the application is running on Heroku without any problems, but it would be nice to derive the connection details from e.g. the MONGOLABURI environment variable.

Negative 2035 pI would like to ask you for advice.

After saving, this rowset should be transformed using some simple mathematic operations. After that it should be further transformed and expanded so that the number of rows as well as the values of Intervals will grow. At last the rowset will be used to fill again the vb.net object of the application. p  pPlease give me an advice which vb.net objects should I use to reach my goal.

Negative 2035 pI am trying to apply the Composite pattern, so I need to create a Leaf class and a Composite class, both inheriting from the same Component class. In order for strongemanyemstrong of my Components to perform their duty they need to ask help from a single Helper object. We have the followingp  precodestruct Helper       void providehelp   struct Component       ComponentHelper helper      mhelperhelper            virtual void operation  0          the callforhelp function will be used by subclasses of Component to implement Componentoperation      void callforhelp          mhelpergtprovidehelp       private     Helper mhelper  codepre  pAnd here are two different Leaf subclassesp  precodestruct Leaf1  Component       Leaf1Helper helper      Componenthelper            void operation override          callforhelp         operation1           void operation1   struct Leaf2  Component       Leaf2Helper helper      Componenthelper            void operation override          callforhelp         operation2           void operation2  codepre  pSo far, so good. Now the Composite class is giving me grief. The typical implementation is as followsp  precodestruct Composite  Component       CompositeHelper helper      Componenthelper            void operation override          for auto el  mchildren elgtoperation       private     stdvectorltComponentgt mchildren  codepre  pwhich by going through the codemchildrencode one by one and calling codeoperationcode on each essentially calls the helper function multiple times, even though one call is enough for all children. Ideally, if the codemchildrencode consisted, say, of a codeLeaf1code and a codeLeaf2code, I would like somehow the Composite operation to call the helper function only once and then call in succession Leaf1operation1 and then Leaf2operation2. Is there any way to achieve what I need Alternative designs are welcome. I hope my question makes sense. Thanks in advancep

Negative 2035 pI have just installed zurbfoundation into my rails project that was already using Fullcalendar. After the install i immediately noticed that most of fullcalendars styling was messed with, some really obvious bugs occuring shaded areas now only half covering dates, button hoverstate is now half filled blue for no reason. Ideally id like my jsscss framework to have no effect on fullcalendars and other js plugins styles.p  pThere are a couple of potential solutionsp  pI could only take in bits of foundations SCSS and javascript so that i avoid the conflicting areas. I can find how to do this for the JS, but the SCSS doesnt seem to work when i remove  require foundation it seems to keep the scss there anyway, even when i try deleting the cache.p  pI could find the culprit areas of foundation and change them, but i dont really know where to start with that, the foundation file structure is weirdp  pLastly, i could ditch the framework all together and use something less invasive. As i can deal with making my own grid, and my own media queries, i have at least one front end man telling me to ditch frameworks all together, but i am just not much of a designer, so i was after buttons and navbars that look good out of the box. Are there good recommendations for lighter weighted sass frameworks that wont mess with stuff so much Or should i just roll up my sleeves and style my own buttons from scratch...p
