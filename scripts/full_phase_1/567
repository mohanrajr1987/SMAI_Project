Positive 567 pI havent worked much with multi language websites and Im wondering what the best way is to decided what language should be shown.p  pI myself go to codeexample.comcodebr My locale is enGB so it automatically loads codeexample.comencode English for me.

It would be annoying to have to change it everyone time someone sends me a link.pli lipShould it load the English page AND set the cookie to English from now onpli lipShould it just load the English page but still keep the cookie Dutch And should everything on the page link to other English pages or link to Dutch cookie language pages.pli ul  pAnd almost the same case but with locale and link on the first visit. I have never been to codeexample.comcodebr Someone links me codeexample.comnlsomepagecode but my locale is enGB.p  ul lipShould the URL take priority over locale and just load the Dutch versionpli lipShould the locale take priority over the URL and load the English version And if I didnt set a preference this visit should the next visit check locale again or just load Dutch againpli ul  pIn my specific case the pages have the exact same content in all languages. But I understand that in some cases different languages might have different content codeexample.comenshippinginfocode might have different information than codeexample.comnlshippinginfocode. Cookie priority over URL might not be such a great idea in the latter case.p

Positive 567 pSo I am to build a web based Point of Sale system.p  pIve been used to developing ASP.NET web applications in the past but I want to avoid postbacks and page reloads therefore I have decided the best method would be HTML5, CSS and Javascript.p  pThe part Im not too sure about is how to handle multiple customers accessing the same website.p  pLets say we have 100 individual businesses who want to buy a license.p  pMy thoughts on how this would work is the following p  p1 1 Server  for now p  p2 SQL Database as the backendp  p3 IIS to host websitesp  p4 Create a virtual directory for each customer which will have the same website in each folderp  p5 Each customer would then navigate to a hrefhttpsxxx.xxx.xx.xxCustomer1 relnofollowhttpsxxx.xxx.xx.xxCustomer1a, a hrefhttpsxxx.xxx.xx.xxCustomer2 relnofollowhttpsxxx.xxx.xx.xxCustomer2a etc...p  p6 The next thought to deal with security is to assign a username and password to each customer so that when they navigate to a hrefhttpsxxx.xxx.xx.xxCustomer1 relnofollowhttpsxxx.xxx.xx.xxCustomer1a, the username and password is     sent with the request  hashed of course for security  and then checked against  the username and password in their record within the SQL database.. then their stock data will be     retrieved once the username and password is authenticated. p  pI could handle this through a method in my API or an aspx handler page or something.     I could use the role provider in ASP.Net to keep all the pages which require authentication in their own folders to control user access. The username and password functionality could      also be managed using the Microsoft Membership Provider, so once the user is authenticated and sent to their home page, the HTML5 pages take over.. no more aspx pages... just an initial     aspx page for logging users in.p  pThis of course would increase the maintainabilty and time required to update and deploy new code  fixes to each folder if each customer had their own site in their own folder.p  pThe only other way I can think is to have a single web application where EVERY customer logs into to authenticate themselves.. again maybe using the Microsoft membership provider. Ive used this before and it works well.. but then you have to start thinking about session state and if session should be InProc or OutProc to store session state information in the SQL database.. it also means there is one Application Pool... other items come into the equation too but there is always just one update to be made if there is new code or a bug fix..p  pWould anyone have any better ideas or care to comment on the pros and cons of my suggested approach abovep  pThanksp

Negative 567 pIf you are developing a memory intensive application in C on Windows, do you opt to write your own custom memory manager to allocate memory from virtual address space or do you allow CRT to take control and do the memory management for you  I am especially concerned about the fragmentation caused by the allocation and deallocation of small objects on heap. Because of this, I think the process will run out of memory eventhough there is enough memory but is fragmented.p
Negative 567 pId like to implement a WebService containing a method whose reply will be delayed for less than 1 second to about an hour it depends if the data is already cached or neeeds to be fetched.p  pBasically my question is what would be the best way to implement this if you are only able to connect from the client to the WebService no notification possiblep  pemAFAIK this will only be possible by using some kind of polling. But polling is bad and so Id rather like to avoid using it. The other extreme could be to just let the connection stay open as long as the method isnt done. But i guess this could end up in slowing down the webserver and the network. I considerd to combine these two technics. Then the client would call the method and the server will return after at least 10 seconds either with the message that the client needs to poll again or the actual result.emp  pWhat are your thoughtsp

Negative 567 pIn the process of trying to port my 2D shadow rendering technique from Directx to Opengl, Ive run across a problem where I cant seem to get fine enough access to the opengl blender. p  pBut first, so that the following makes sense, my algorithmp  pI sort and render all sprites from back to front without using a depth buffer.  Shadow sprites are drawn just before the objects that cast them and use the second blendstate below, gShadowBlendState.  That makes them draw only their alpha values to the alpha channel on the framebuffer.  p  pSprites for regular objects use gBlendState specified first below, which is just a regular alpha blend to the backbuffer.  However, they also remove alpha from the backbuffer alpha channel to the extent that they are opaque this makes sure that shadows dont show through opaque objects that are in front of them.p  pThe third thing that is drawn, and which is drawn after everything else, is a fullscreen quad that renders using the shadow colour and the final blend state below.  It uses the backbuffers alpha channel for opacity, effectively bringing out all the shadow information inscribed earlier.  p  pThe whole point of this exercise is to get shadows that dont get darker where they overlap.p  precodegBlendState.SrcBlend        D3DBLENDSRCALPHA gBlendState.BlendOp         D3DBLENDOPADD gBlendState.DestBlend       D3DBLENDINVSRCALPHA gBlendState.SrcBlendAlpha   D3DBLENDZERO gBlendState.BlendOpAlpha    D3DBLENDOPADD gBlendState.DestBlendAlpha  D3DBLENDINVSRCALPHA  gShadowBlendState.SrcBlend        D3DBLENDZERO gShadowBlendState.BlendOp         D3DBLENDOPADD gShadowBlendState.DestBlend       D3DBLENDONE gShadowBlendState.SrcBlendAlpha   D3DBLENDONE gShadowBlendState.BlendOpAlpha    D3DBLENDOPMAX gShadowBlendState.DestBlendAlpha  D3DBLENDONE  gShadowFillBlendState.SrcBlend        D3DBLENDDESTALPHA gShadowFillBlendState.BlendOp         D3DBLENDOPADD gShadowFillBlendState.DestBlend       D3DBLENDINVDESTALPHA gShadowFillBlendState.SrcBlendAlpha   D3DBLENDONE gShadowFillBlendState.BlendOpAlpha    D3DBLENDOPMAX gShadowFillBlendState.DestBlendAlpha  D3DBLENDONE codepre  pAnyway.

Negative 567 pI want to feed OpenSSL specific data for use as random seed during the signing of data with an EC key. Im doing this to compare my application with another reference one closed source. That utility takes the file with private key, file with data to sign and file with random data as parameters.p  pIve got the generation of EC keys, and signing of data down, but cant compare the two applications since I have no common ground.

Negative 567 pOK, I have a table with no natural key, only an integer identity column as its primary key. Id like to insert and retrieve the identity value, but also use a trigger to ensure that certain fields are always set. Originally, the design was to use instead of insert triggers, but that breaks scopeidentity. The output clause on the insert statement is also broken by the instead of insert trigger. So, Ive come up with an alternate plan and would like to know if there is anything obviously wrong with what I intend to dop  pbegin contrived examplep  precode    CREATE TABLE [dbo].[TestData]      [TestId] [int] IDENTITY1,1 PRIMARY KEY NOT NULL,     [Name] [nchar]10 NOT NULL      CREATE TABLE [dbo].[TestDataModInfo]     [TestId] [int] PRIMARY KEY NOT NULL,     [RowCreateDate] [datetime] NOT NULL      ALTER TABLE [dbo].[TestDataModInfo]  WITH CHECK ADD  CONSTRAINT     [FKTestDataModInfoTestData] FOREIGN KEY[TestId]     REFERENCES [dbo].[TestData] [TestId] ON DELETE CASCADE  CREATE TRIGGER [dbo].[TestDataAfterInsert]    ON [dbo].[TestData]    AFTER INSERT AS  BEGIN      SET NOCOUNT ON added to prevent extra result sets from      interfering with SELECT statements.     SET NOCOUNT ON     INSERT INTO [dbo].[TestDataModInfo]            [TestId],             [RowCreateDate]     SELECT     [TestId],             currenttimestamp     FROM inserted       Insert statements for trigger here  END codepre  pEnd contrived example.p  pNo, Im not doing this for one little date field  its just an example.p  pThe fields that I want to ensure are set have been moved to a separate table in TestDataModInfo and the trigger ensures that its updated.

Negative 567 pIm trying to create a pretty simple graphing component that consists of a series of Polylines within the same grid cell that represent graph lines.  My strategy is to look at all the points in my set, determine the min and max, and then calculate a number between 0 to 1 accordingly and use StretchFill to stretch each Polyline to fill the grid cell.  My desired effect would be that a point at 0,.5 would be vertically in the center of the cell, but in reality the Polyline gets stretched vertically to fill the entire cell depending on what the min and max Y value is.  E.g. if .5 is my max and .7 is my min in the Polyline, then .5 will be clear at the top of the cell and .7 clear at the bottom, rather than .5 in the center and .7 710 to the bottom.p  pHeres a simple example with two Polylines and calculated points between 0 and 1.  Youll notice the red Polyline is directly on top of the blue one, even though the red Y values are greater.  The red Polyline should look the same as the blue, but be oriented slightly lower in the cell.  However its being stretched to fill the entire cell so it sits directly on top of the blue.p  precodeltWindow xClassTest.Window1 xmlnshttpschemas.microsoft.comwinfx2006xamlpresentation xmlnsxhttpschemas.microsoft.comwinfx2006xaml TitleWindow1 Height100 Width300gt ltGridgt     ltPolyline         StretchFill         StrokeBlue         Points0,0 0.2,0 0.2,0.363636363636364 0.4,0.363636363636364 0.4,0.636363636363636 0.6,0.636363636363636 0.6,0.0909090909090909 0.8,0.0909090909090909 0.8,0 1,0 gt     ltPolyline         StretchFill         StrokeRed         Points0,0.363636363636364 0.2,0.363636363636364 0.2,0.727272727272727 0.4,0.727272727272727 0.4,1 0.6,1 0.6,0.454545454545455 0.8,0.454545454545455 0.8,0.363636363636364 1,0.363636363636364 gt ltGridgt codepre  pp  pThe reason Im using 0 to 1 values is because I want the width and height of the grid cell to be easily changeable, e.g. via a slider or something to adjust the height of the graph, or dragging the window wider to adjust the width.

Negative 567 pIs there any way to make nonblocking SOAP requests within EventMachine p  pIm creating a ruby application which interacts with the google adwords api which is SOAP based, using the adwords4r gem. The application uses EM to receive messages over a stomp connection, and then processes those messages by making SOAP calls to the adwords api.

One option would be to use EM.defer, but Id rather not have the overhead of a bunch of threads in a threadpool.p

Negative 567 pHi I am looking for ideas to populate a fact table in a data mart. Lets say i have the following dimensionsp  ol li Physician li li Patient li li date li li geolocation li li patientdemography li li test li ol  pI have used two ETL tools to populate the dimension tables Pentaho and Oracle Warehouse Builder. The date, patient demography and geo locations do not pull data from the operational store. All dimension tables have their own NEW surrogate key. p  pI now want to populate the fact table with the details of a visit by a patient.When a patient visits a physician on a particular date, he orders a test. This is the info in the fact table. There are other measures too that I am omitting for simplicity.p  pI can create a single join with all the required columns in the fact table from the source system. But, i need to store the keys from the dimension tables for Patient, Physician, test etc.. What is the best way to achieve thisp  pCan ETL tools help in this p  pThank You Krishnap

Negative 567 pI have a small Access 2007 database that I need to be able to import data from an existing spreadsheet and put it into our new relational model.  For the most part this seems to work pretty well.  Part of the process is attempting to see if a record already exists in a target table using SQL.  For example, if I extract book information out of the current row in the spreadsheet, it may contain a title and abstract.  I use SQL to get the ID of a matching record, if it exists.p  pThis works fine except when I have data thats in a nonEnglish language.  In this case, it seems that there is some punctuation that is causing me problems.  At least I think its punctuation as I do have some fields that do not have punctuation and are nonEnglish that do not give me any problems.p  pIs there a builtin function that can escape these characters  Currently I have a small function that will escape the single quote character, but that isnt enough.  Or, is there a list of Unicode characters that can interfere with how SQL wants data quotedp  pThanks in advance.p

Negative 567 pI need fully functional vector format, which i can decode to plain bitmap data in my app. It doesnt need to be SVG, but it seemed best but other suggestions are welcome. So, i need an lib to simply rasterize SVG into plain pixel data  the simplier, the better. The problem is I need it for bada OS its OS for mobile phones, so i need to compile it directly with bada IDE. I found librsvg, but it seems it needs linux environment to build, so i cant use it but im not sure, i dont know much about linux  if there is a way to compile it normally, tell me. I also found graphics magick, which would be perfect, but it cant correctly decode the SVG files i need SVG support is partial. Chrome, Firefox and Inkscape opens those files perfectly. So, what lib can i use for simple rasterization of SVG files It can be C or C, needs to be fully open source.p

Negative 567 pIm trying to figure out how to bind a javascript event to a select element in GWT, however the select element isnt being built in GWT, but comes from HTML that Im scraping from another site a report site from a different department.

Im able to get the HTML and parse out the div that Im interested in.

I do the followingp  p1 start my applicationbr 2 get to a point where the application will show the leakbr 3 start instruments using the allocations choicebr 4 attach to my process and start recordingbr 5 take an initial heapshotbr 6 take an initial snapshot with VM trackerbr 7 reproduce the steps that cause the memory to risebr 8 take another heapshotbr 9 take another snapshot with VM trackerbrp  pIf I do those steps, I see results that dont really make sense.  I am hoping that I am missing some information about how these tools work.  For example, I know that the leaks tool doesnt track ALL kinds of memory allocations carbon apps for example.   My application is a huge, legacy app that could have weird allocation code in some out dated subsystem that I am not familiar with.  That said, this is what I seep  ul liin the initial snapshot of VM tracker when I look at the summary, the type MALLOCSMALL is fairly small at roughly 72MB virtual sizeli liin the second snapshot, MALLOCSMALL usage has grown to 224MB again virtual sizeli liin the second heapshot, it tells me the heapgrowth is 45MBli ul  pSo how can MALLOCSMALL grow from 72MB to 224MB, but the heapgrowth is only 45MB    Is the Allocations instrument missing something that VMTracker is recording    p  pFurther supporting that I am missing something in the Allocations instrument...if I look at the NEW regions listed under MALLOCSMALL ones that werent in the first snapshot, but were in second, those addresses should correspond to pages that were allocated and account for the 72MB224MB difference, correct   So then, I remembered the range of addresses for that region eg,   0x790000000x7b000000, and go back to the Allocations instrument and sort of the list of All Objects by address.   Then I look for addresses in that range.   However, I only see 4 allocations that account only for 4KB  Where are the other 32MB that VM tracker reported in that regionp  pAny help would be appreciated....I am hoping it is something basic about how these tools work that I am just not understanding.p

Negative 567 pI have a setup where I have a parent page P with two child controls C1 and C2 and each child control has a sub control S1 and S2 one belonging to C1 and C2 respectively.

I know I could do it by having the S1 control bubble an event to P and have P call C1 and C2s update method.

Negative 567 pIm writing a clientserver utility application. They communicate through codeTcpClientcodecodeStreamcode client and codeTcpListenercodecodeSocketcode server. I send bytes back and forth between these two, then I come to the part where I have a problem the client sends a signal to the server say codeStartCountingcode. The client starts doing some stuff say counts up from zero. The server does the same as soon as it receives the codeStartCountingcode. Now, while both sides are counting, each side may interrupt the counting say by pressing return. When one side stops, it sends a message to the other side to stop.

Negative 567 pIm looking for a solution to add persistence to my nativecode application. It should be simple no SQL, fast, and mostimportantly reliable.p  pThe best approach I can think of is using memorymapped files. Its as simple and fast as it can get  you simply store the values in plaindata arrays in memory. However, I dont think its very reliable  a power failure could leave the database in an inconsistent or corrupted state. Being able to transactionally sync a group of memorymapped files to disk would solve this, but I dont think its possible. Also, unless the filesystem supports snapshots or COW cloning e.g. a hrefhttpen.wikipedia.orgwikiBtrfs relnofollowBrtfsa, backups would mean having to stop the application completely while the files are being copied.p  pDoes anyone have better ideasp

Negative 567 pId love some ideas about how I should implement a key part of a project I am working on.  Essentially it is data mapping, where I copy field x and put it into field y.  However, there needs to be some ability to dynamically change using string manipulation that value during the transition.p  pWhat I would like is a textbox where a user could enter script allowing them to modify that value using a scripting language, ideally VBScript.

Negative 567 pIt is often recommended to program to an interface, not an implementation.  It is useful to promote separation of concerns, and helps with unit testing.  However, I was thinking about API programming.p  pLets say I wrote an API and that API used a lot of programming to interfaces.  Lets also say that the API was insanely popular and used by many external clients.  If one of the interfaces in the API had to change, that would require apps using the API to be recompiled.p  pMy question is, how is such an issue avoided or the impact of such changes reduced, or is it unavoidable  I am not an API programer and would like to know the best practice here.  It seems to me that changing an interface that has existed for a long time and is widely used is a bad idea.p

Negative 567 pOkay, so Ive successfully completed my goal using buttons which was merely a test. My real goal is to dynamically change the innerHTML within a DIV, based on the option selected using the drop down menu. The catch however, is that it MUST be done using each menu items unique ID. It CANNOT work using the value of each menu item, as the value is being utilized by an entirely different script, which is working for the moment.p  pI have a working example using buttons as well as a drop down menu, but the drop down menu only works in this example because I am using a separate function for each list option. When this goes live, Ill have two drop down menus that will contain several dozen items, so writing a function for every item would be time consuming and not very practical for production.p  pHere is the working examplep  precodeltDOCTYPE html PUBLIC W3CDTD XHTML 1.0 TransitionalEN httpwww.w3.orgTRxhtml1DTDxhtml1transitional.dtdgt lthtml xmlnshttpwww.w3.org1999xhtmlgt ltheadgt lttitlegtsandbox 1lttitlegt ltmeta httpequivContentType contenttexthtml charsetiso88591 gt ltstyle typetextcssgt content  display block width 50 height 300px border 1px solid blue overflow hidden marginleft auto marginright auto  ltstylegt  ltheadgt  ltbodygt  ltscript typetextjavascriptgt  function innerHTML1  document.getElementByIdcontent.innerHTML  ltiframe srchttpwww.google.ca width100 height100 framebordernogtltiframegt   function innerHTML2  document.getElementByIdcontent.innerHTML  ltiframe srchttpwww.msn.ca width100 height100 framebordernogtltiframegt   ltscriptgt  ltdiv idcontentgtltdivgtltbr gt ltinput typebutton onclickinnerHTML1 valueopen Google gt ltpgt ltinput typebutton onclickinnerHTML2 valueopen MSN gt ltpgt ltpgt ltselectgt ltoption valuegtselect an option...ltoptiongt ltoption value onClickinnerHTML1gtopen Googleltoptiongt ltoption value onClickinnerHTML2gtopen MSNltoptiongt ltselectgt ltpgt   ltbodygt lthtmlgt codepre  pSo the above example seems to do the job fine, but thats because its using two functions, one for each menu time.p  pSo here is what I have so far and is what I need help with p  precodeltDOCTYPE html PUBLIC W3CDTD XHTML 1.0 TransitionalEN httpwww.w3.org    TRxhtml1DTDxhtml1transitional.dtdgt lthtml xmlnshttpwww.w3.org1999xhtmlgt ltheadgt lttitlegtsandbox 2lttitlegt ltmeta httpequivContentType contenttexthtml charsetiso88591 gt ltstyle typetextcssgt content  display block width 50 height 300px border 1px solid blue overflow hidden marginleft auto marginright auto  contentarea  display block width 50 height 300px border 1px solid blue overflow hidden marginleft auto marginright auto  ltheadgt ltbodygt ltstylegt ltscript typetextjavascriptgt function changeContent  var newContent  document.getElementByIdselection  var ContentInfo  newContent.selectedIndex newContent.value  newContent.options[ContentInfo].id  document.getElementByIdcontent.innerHTML  newContent  ltscriptgt ltdiv idcontentgtltdivgt  ltpgt ltselect idselection onchangeJavaScriptchangeContentgt ltoption value id selectedselectedgtSelect a website to load in the DIV..ltoptiongt ltoption valuePage1 idPage1.htmlgtPage1ltoptiongt ltoption valuePage2 idPage2.htmlgtPage2ltoptiongt ltoption valuePage3 idPage3.htmlgtPage3ltoptiongt ltoption valuePage4 idPage4.htmlgtPage4ltoptiongt ltselectgt ltpgt ltpgt ltscript languageJavaScript typetextjavascriptgt lt function showSelected  var PageList  document.getElementByIdPages var displayPage  document.getElementByIdcontentarea  var NewPage  PageList.selectedIndex displayPage.value  PageList.options[NewPage].id document.getElementByIdcontentarea.innerHTML  displayPage  gt ltscriptgt ltselect idPages onchangeshowSelectedgt ltoption selectedselected value idgtSelect a website to load in the DIV..ltoptiongt ltoption value idPage1.htmlgtPage 1ltoptiongt ltoption value idPage2.htmlgtPage 2ltoptiongt ltoption value idPage3.htmlgtPage 3ltoptiongt ltoption value idPage4.htmlgtPage 4ltoptiongt ltselectgt ltpgt ltdiv idcontentareagtltdivgt ltbodygt lthtmlgt codepre  pFirst thing to point out is that I tried writing the script in 2 different methods, both presenting their own unique error.

I recently completed the work with the help of someone else, but somehow screwed up the code along the way without any kind of backups available to me.p  pThe essential idea of the database is this  Theres the users database which holds the username, datecreated, rTotal, and rAttend columns.  rAttend is incremented if they attend a raid.   There is another table called raid that simply holds the date  id of a raid.   Lastly there is a 3rd and final table that holds usernames and dates.p  pThe script works something like this, an html page passes all the usernames that showed up to raid, and adds the date into the raid table.   The mysql query that I have is supposed to check a user, and for each raid display the time of raid, membername, and whether he went or not, if the result is null, they missed that raid, if its not, they went.p  pWithout further adieu...Heres the query vmember is sanitized prior to this when the variable is set, it is set via postp  precodemysqlselectdbdatabase or die Unable to select database      query  SELECT DISTINCT      r.rDate,      CASE      WHEN a.userName IS NULL THEN No      ELSE Yes      END AS Attended      FROM raids r LEFT JOIN SELECT UserName, rDate FROM attend WHERE UserNamevmember a ON r.rDatea.rDate      WHERE r.rDate gt SELECT dateCreated FROM users WHERE UserNamevmember      ORDER BY r.rDate ASC codepre  pI was wondering how I can take the results from that query, and simply set up a loop with the 2 variables it should be extracting.   p  precode            f1result[rDate]             f2vmember             f3result[Attended] codepre  pIf anyone can help with this I would really appreciate it, as I broke something along the way and I have no idea what...Thanksp
Negative 567 pIve just started using the sniptMate plugin for VIM and love it, however, since my collection of snippets isnt huge, Id like to be able to add new snippets dynamically rather than opening the snippets file and creating a new snippet as I am in the middle of development.  p  pAs I am coding something I realize that some specific piece of code can be saved as a snippet to save me trouble of typing the bloat code again, at this time I want to be able to add a snippet without opening the snippet file for the language I am using at the time. p

Negative 567 pIm working on a singlepage application with Backbone.js v0.5.5, and on one page of the app I have a Master View audioOnDemand and two Secondary Views audioPlay and audioNav. I wanted the secondary views to be routable, so that the user could, as an example, go to audioondemand, audioondemandidid, or audioondemandpagepage and everything would load. In order to make this work, I ended up having to put some jQuery code in my controllersrouters, which felt very hacky. Which is why Im here, to see if theres a better way.p  pHeres my controllersrouters.p  precodeaudioondemand functionsplat      this.audioondemandview  new AudioOnDemandView     this.audioondemandview.render      if splat          var idpatt  iddi         var id  idpatt.execsplat         id  id  id[1]  null         console.logid is id          var pagepatt  pagedi         var page  pagepatt.execsplat          page  page  page[1]  1     console.logpage is page      if id          setTimeoutapp.playaudioid, 500           setTimeoutapp.audionavpage, 500 ,  audionav functionpage      var navholder  paginationnav     if navholder.length  0          app.audioondemandpagepage      else          var audios  this.audios         var nav  new AudioNavViewel navholder, audios audios, page page         nav.render      ,  playaudio functionid      var audioholder  audioplayer     if audioholder.length  0          app.audioondemandidid      else          var audio  this.audios.getByUidid         this.audioview  new AudioViewel audioplayer, model audio         this.audioview.render       codepre  pThe views dont do anything particularly special, but heres my master template using jQuery Templatesp  precodeltscript idaudioOnDemandTmpl typetextxjquerytmplgt     ltdiv classsubheadergt         ltstronggtAudioltstronggt On Demand     ltdivgt     ltdiv idcurrentlyplayinggt         ltdiv idcurrentlyheadergtCurrently Playingltdivgt         ltdiv idcurrentholdergtltdivgt     ltdivgt     ltdiv idaudioplayergtltdivgt     ltdiv idpaginationnavgtltdivgt     ltdiv idaudiosholdergtltdivgt ltscriptgt codepre  pI would assume by now you get the dilemma.

Negative 567 pIm a bit stuck with one thing. Just cant make up my mind on whether to use POST or GET method at my search form.p  pNormally I would use GET method for such a form, so users could bookmark their results they got. But this time, the search form is present in administration area, so results are relevant shortly and there is no need to bookmark results and of course, they arent public for everyone.p  pTo be more specific, the search feature is meant to be used along with a list of users, so there could be some specific user to be searched. My idea was to use POST method, where the form would be redirected to the same page so I would get a list of users filtered by search string. There was also pagination, so I would add the search string at the and of each pagination link next page, previous page, first page and last page link so the search string wouldnt be lost later on within any session coming after the search like paginating of searched results etc..p  pThere is no obvious reason to prefer one before another, both can be used. The POST method would be a little bit more hassle, but on the other hand, there are advanced options within the search form about 5 checkboxes and I dont like the idea of having meesed up URL bar with way too many values and I expect users not to use pagination after search session so often, so the values wouldnt get to the address bar so often if POST method used.p  pWhich one would you prefer for searching in CMS and alike systemsp  pThanks everyonep

Negative 567 pI just discovered impure.com and was very impressed by what can be achieved in terms of visualizing data using their workspace. Although the platform is free to use, but not open source yet. This causes a few problems because the API section works with .com sites for eg. for ebay, so I cannot visualize ebay listings for regional sites such as ebay.in because the link to ebay.com is hardcoded.p  pI searched around, but didnt find other projects that offer a similar way to work with site APIs and other data sources with the kind of user interface and detail that impure.com does in a realtime way within a browser window.p  pThis brings me to the questions p  pWhat technologies would be involved in creating a similar kind of projectp  pWhat are the open source tools that can help develop a fullscreen UI to render the workspace. Are there any alternatives to flash for this, and how do they comparep  pThe goal would be to use standard python data structures, python scripts to do some processing on these data structures, scripts to gather data from csv, json and API sources such as google yahoo, wikipedia and flickr, and scripts to render graphs, tag clouds, network visualizations etc. Then bring them all together into a visual interface that supports drag drop and  simple type checkingp  pHow would the python backend integrate with the UIp  psorry for the rambling question, but i wanted to present as much detail as possible. Id like to do this for the fun of itp

Negative 567 pI am setting up some css for media print and I had to make use of IE conditionals to get it crossbrowser compatible.  Looking here and elsewhere, it seems theres no IE conditionals that detect IE 8 compatibility mode.  The only way to do so is make use of meta tags or JavaScript, correctp  pI know how to detect compatibility mode in JavaScript.  My question is how do I write one particular line of css for media print using JavaScript.  If i have to, Ill settle for linking to a separate stylesheet.  But I managed to get my current print media stylesheet crossbrowser compatible, with the notable exception of ie 8 compatibility mode.  If I can just add what I need in JavaScript, instead of creating a separate stylesheet for IE 8 compatibility mode, that would be great.  Either way, I would like to know how I can add media print css for IE 8 compatibility mode using Javascriptp  pThank youp

Negative 567 pIm animating a buttons position, rotating it around a circle. This creates a codeUISwitchcodelike behavior, except it is a lot more fancy. The button rotates, but it ends up off the desired position by about 0.25 radians.

Any help in determining the correct way to rotate the button is appreciated.p  pI tried other ways to rotate objects. For example, I have an arrow  codeltxcode, and I would like to rotate this arrow in a circle around codexcode . What is the correct anchor point placement for this operation Is it [1, 0.5]p  pAn easier way to do this kind of rotations is to put an object within a symmetric codeUIViewcode, center it at the desired point of rotation and assign a rotation transform. This works, but requires the view to be twice as bigp  pcodeYxYcode    lt this rotates Y around center point X without any anchor point adjustments. this is a very useful method to rotate arrows within analog gauges and such. p

Negative 567 pIm using Luabind to bind a C API to Lua. I have some objects that cannot be created directly, but rather must be created on another thread.

I could also replace the second BeginInvoke with just Invoke so EndInvoke is unnecessary.  I like the idea of moving the logic away from the form, but I dont see how the result would change.  I would think a BackgroundWorker would also have the same issue that being the callback is no longer accessible.  I suppose an event could be raised with the result, but that seems a little abstract.  Could you please elaborate a little more or provide an example.  p

Negative 567 pI currently analyze our customer data and trends by a number of SQL queries and the testing of a hypothesis can be timeexpensive. p  pFor instance, we have a table of our customer info and a table of our customer service calls, indexed by customer. Id like to find out if a particular cohort of customers had more CS issues than another and if there is any correlation between customer service calls and increased cancel rates. p  pI was looking into MSs BI studio, as were running MSSQL 2008 already but most of what Ive read focuses on carefully constructed MDX cubes that aggregate numerical data so in the above model, Id have to build a cube of facts number of CS calls and types and then use the customer data as dimensions. Fair enough, but in the time itd take me to do that, I could just write the query manually in TSQL.p  pMy DB is small enough that the speed gains from a separate datamart arent necessary  what Im looking for is a flexible way of looking at my data, by creating a Customer Object and tying all sorts of data, actions and numerical values to them. And Id rather have the data extracted from my existing tables rather than having to ETL to a separate table. p  pIdeally at some point, Id be able to use Data Mining tools for predictive analysis, but right now Im going after low hanging fruit  do customers from this ad campaign cancel more than the other one etc.p  pAm I barking up the wrong tree with SQL Analysis ServicesMDX cubes Or does what Im talking about not exist easily to begin with Any advice, directions to products, or insight greatly appreciated.p

Negative 567 pHow do you protect a file from editing by an external program  or user , even if that user has somehow got root privileges. Lets say I have this File F which I have to protect and by default only the root and user can execute , read and write to F, all others only have read permission.p  pLets say I have a program, which is protecting the critical file F, and detects that the circumstances of editing are unusual and seems like the security of the system may have been compromised. How to prevent saving changes to the File F If possible also kill that program which tried making that change.p  pI have found out that fuser can kill that process, but not before any modifications aka damage has been done. I use inotify to detect changes. My problem is most of the editors make a temporary file, make changes, and then save it to original file. Although I receive event like INOPEN, INCLOSENOWRITE and others, I get INCLOSEWRITE and INCLOSEMODIFY only after the event is complete  How do I stop my file F From being modified p  pI understand that my program may be killed after someone gets into the system, but can I somehow save whatever little I can p  pEdit I forgot to mention I cant change the permissions of any file which are monitored.p  pEdit 2 I have a set of files which have to be constantly monitored. My program would run in the background and note changes in those files. All files as I wrote earlier can be edited and executed by root, but there are actionsmodifications which may be undesirable and most probably would mean that someone has gained root access and has edited those critical files. I need to stop these harmful changes. From the answers I somehow presume that I will have to get a snapshot of those files. But the problem is the number of files could be huge , around 1 to 4 million. Any solutions which are efficient than snapshot solution are welcome.p

Negative 567 pI built a small demo application by starting with a splitview based template. Then using IB I added a Scroll View to the detail view and then an Image View to the Scroll View. Both the Scroll View and the Image View are the same size as the detail view. Finally I added a png image to the Image View the was the same size as the Image View.p  pWhen I run this app, starting in portrait mode, everything is fine. But when I rotate the ipad to landscape, I see only a portion of image in the detail view, starting with the upper left corner and going as far down and to the right as will fit in the view. I would like to be able to scroll other portions of the image into view, but the image does not move when I try to drag it. Ive played around with properties of the Scroll View and Image View available in IB, but I have not been able to find a configuration that allows me to scroll the image around in landscape mode. Can someone tell me whether and how I might be able to do thisp  pThanksp

Negative 567 pI have a Java batch which does a select with a large resulset I process the elements using a Spring callbackhandler.  The callbackhandler puts a task in a fixed threadpool to process the row.  My poolsize is fixed on 16 threads.  The resulset contains about 100k elements. All db access code is handled through a JdbcTemplate or through HibernateSpring, no manual connection management is present. I have tried with Atomikos and with Commons DBCP as connection pool.p  pNow, I would think that 17 max connections in my connectionpool would be enough to get this batch to finish. One for the select and 16 for the threads in the connectionpool which update some rows. However that seems to be too naive, as I have to specify a max pool size a magnitude larger havent tried for an exact value, first I tried 50 which worked on my local Windows machine, but doesnt seem to be enough on our Unix test environment. There I have to specify 128 to make it work again, I didnt even try a value between 50 and 128, I went straight to 128.p  pIs this normal Is there some fundamental mechanism in connection pooling Im missing I find it hard to debug this as I dont know how to see what happens with the opened connections. I tried various log4j settings but didnt get any satisfactory result.p  pedit, additional info when the connectionpool size seems to be too low, the batch seems to hang. If I do a jstat on the process I can see all threads are waiting for a new connection. At first I didnt specify the maxWait property on the dbcp connection pool, which causes threads to wait indefinitely on a new connection, and I noticed the batch kept hanging. So no connections were released. However, that only happened after processing 70k rows, which dismissed my initial hunch of connection leakage somehow.p  pedit2 I forgot to mention I already rewrote the update part in my tasks. I qeueu my updates in a ConcurrentLinkedQueue, I empty that on 1000 elements. So i actually only do about 100 updates.p  pedit3 Im using Oracle and I am using the concurrent utils. So i have an executor configured with fixed poolsize of 16. I submit my tasks on this executor. I dont use connections manually in my tasks, I use jdbctemplate which is threadsafe and asks it connections from the connectionpool. I suppose SpringDBCP handles the connectionthread issue.p

What happens if this is the case, only 3 of the colourcoded ranges are displayed, which is fine and this is the expected behaviour. As the alternatingBandFills array is defined in this order  red, orange,green,orange, red , the colours shown are redorangegreen. That is totally fine and expected.p  pHowever, on some of the data sets, which has the same logic as the others i.e. lowerRedRangeFrom  lowerOrangeRangeFrom, the graphs alternatingBandFills are displayed like  orangegreenorange. p  pCan someone explain me why this is the case  The confusion comes from the fact that for a given dataset, there is no problem, and for others there is although the proportions are the same. I know that CorePlot will cycle through the alternatinBandFills array and display the colours, but for some reason sometimes it starts cycling at index  1, instead of at the start at the array.p  pThanks,p  pPetarp

Negative 567 pI am implementing a VOIP application in which I work with SIP protocol. As per SIP I need to refresh my registration with SIP server at certain interval. But when my app goes in background, my keepalive handler is invoked only after 600 seconds as per documents os Apple. But this is not desired with SIP protocol. To be able to keep my connection alive with server and receive incoming call, I need to send registration message before 600 seconds even when app is in background. According to Apple documentation this is not possible but stilll I have seen apps on AppStore which runs in background and keeps their registration on with SIP server even when registration interval is 60 seconds. They keep app running in background throughout. So how is this possible I know that playing silent audio in background will survive but then AppReview process will reject it. But if its so, how Apple allowed other such apps on AppStore Is there some standard way to achieve what I have described above Any help is appreciated.p

Negative 567 pstrongBackgroundstrongp  pI have a page where I have various clientside events being handled with JavaScript. I want to sync some of these events with serverside events, or otherwise call functions from the codebehind.p  pSome of the functions I want to call with JavaScript may make changes to controls e.g. changing a textbox value in a form I have on the page. They may also change some values I have stored in the ViewState, as I want some values to persist through postbacks. I do not want to a full postback, and have the controls that may be changed in an update panel.p  pI am currently calling functions in my codebehind with JavaScript by clicking invisible buttons that trigger partial postback on my page through an asynchronous postback trigger in my update panel.p  pstrongProblemstrongp  pOne of my clientside events calls a JavaScript function that clicks more than one of the invisible buttons clientside stuff happens between the clicks that may affect how the the codebehind functions behave. When I have the JavaScript clicking more than one button, the changes made to the ViewState do not seem to persist, and only the changes from the last click are observed.p  pstrongExamplestrongp  pI might not have explained this very well, so here is a simplified version of what I have which I can reproduce the issue with.p  pemMarkupemp  precodeltaspButton IDbtnA runatserver styledisplay none gt ltaspButton IDbtnB runatserver styledisplay none gt ltdiv stylebackground red width 100px height 100px onclickABgtltdivgt  ltaspScriptManager IDScriptManager1 runatservergtltaspScriptManagergt ltaspUpdatePanel runatserver IDupForm UpdateModeConditionalgt     ltTriggersgt             ltaspAsyncPostBackTrigger ControlIDbtnA EventNameClick gt             ltaspAsyncPostBackTrigger ControlIDbtnB EventNameClick gt     ltTriggersgt     ltContentTemplategt     ltContentTemplategt ltaspUpdatePanelgt codepre  pemJavaScriptemp  precodefunction AB      lt btnA.ClientID gt.click     lt btnB.ClientID gt.click  codepre  pemCodebehindemp  precodeProtected Sub btnAClickByVal sender As Object, ByVal e As EventArgs Handles btnA.Click     ViewStateAB  A End Sub Protected Sub btnBClickByVal sender As Object, ByVal e As EventArgs Handles btnB.Click     ViewStateAB  B End Sub codepre  pstrongQuestionsstrongp  ol liWhy are the changes to ViewState between partial postbacks lostli liHow can I save the changes between the partial postbacks Session variables work great, but I would rather not have to resort to using them.

Negative 567 pLets say that I have an object model with many different objects that I then, using the Entity Framework map to database tables. That all works fine. The problem is what happens when I want to save more objects to the database. The objects in the model are interconnected, so when I am saving objects to the database, they may have references to objects that are already in the database.p  pFor example, if I have an object called codePersoncode which has a property codeFriendscode which in itself is a list of people. This means that there is a table of Persons in the database and each of these has a list of friends which are identified by their IDs. Assuming that if the IDs of two people are the same then they are the same person, then I believe the Entity Framework will throw an error if I try to add them again. So the problem is when I add another person object who already has a list of friends, then I want to add friends who are not in the database, and I do not want to add the ones that already are in the database. Also each of those people may have friends who arearent in the database and I want them considered too. Another thing to consider is that even if the person is already in the database I want to look through their list of friends and add any new ones.p  pI feel like this should be a fairly common problem when working with databases, but Im probably using the wrong vocabulary since nothing useful is actually coming up in all of my searches. It mostly deals with how to scan databases for duplicates after the fact or something like that. I want this to be handled in a business logic C code layer through an EntityFrameworkapproved venue. Any help is appreciated. Thank you in advance.p

But as you probably know coroutines share the same global environment with their luaState parent and all they other coroutines issued from the same luaState.p  pFor example I would like to expose the codethisItemcode global to each coroutine so each script each one with its own coroutine could call codethisItemcode and get a different value, even if they are using the same luaState parent and are nested.p  pSo I tried different approach, such as exposing  unexposing the value using a stack, but none was thread proof indeed.p  pMy last attempt was to associate the global codethisItemcode with a metatable where codeindexcode andor codecallcode keys were modified to call a function which in turn tried to return the right value. p  pHere is how I expose itp  precode Define a callback function int LuaVMDEBUGFUNCTIONluaState L       Do stuff to return the right value     return 1    Create callback metatable in the constructor LuaVMLuaVM      Init Lua     mState  luaLnewstate     luaLopenlibsmState      etc...       Define the callback metatable     luaLnewmetatablemState, ThreadLocalMT     luapushstringmState, call     luapushcclosuremState, DEBUGFUNCTION,0     luasettablemState, 3    Then define the exposeInstance function template ltclass Cgt bool LuaVMexposeInstanceC ptr, other stuff       LuaObjectltCgt ret  LuaObjectltCgtluanewuserdatamState, sizeofLuaObjectltCgt     retgtptr  ptr      luaLgetmetatablemState, ThreadLocalMT     luasetmetatablemState, 2     luasetglobalmState,thisItem       other stuff      return true  codepre  pBut its not really what I was looking for... I need to call codethisItemcode instead of the variable codethisItemcode and Im wondering if there is a way to create a table to store all the values and return the right one using a less tricky solution.p  pI am not accustomed with threads nor with Lua Capi and so I need your help. There is maybe a better way to manage this problem in a multithread environment p  pThank youp

Negative 567 pIm in the middle of attempting to replace a Solr setup with Elasticsearch. This is a new setup, which has not yet seen production, so I have lots of room to fiddle with things and get them working well.p  pI have very, very large amounts of data. Im indexing some live data and holding onto it for 7 days by using the ttl field. I do not store any data in the index and disabled the source field. I expect my index to stabilize around strong20 billionstrong rows. I will be putting this data into 23 named indexes. Search performance so far with up to a few billion rows is totally acceptable, but indexing performance is an issue. p  pemI am a bit confused about how ES uses shards internally. I have created two ES nodes, each with a separate data directory, each with 8 indexes and 1 replica. When I look at the cluster status, I only see one shard and one replica for each node. Doesnt each node keep multiple indexes running internally Checking the ondisk storage location shows that there is definitely only one Lucene index present.em  Resolved, as my index setting was not picked up properly from the config. Creating the index using the API and specifying the number of shards and replicas has now produced exactly what I wouldve expected to see.p  pemAlso, I tried running multiple copies of the same ES node from the same configuration, and it recognizes that there is already a copy running and creates its own working area. These new instances of nodes also seem to only have one index ondisk.em  Now that each node is actually using multiple indices, a single node with many indices is more than sufficient to throttle the entire system, so this is a nonissue.p  pWhen do you start additional Elasticsearch nodes, for maximum indexing performance Should I have many nodes each running with 1 index 1 replica, or fewer nodes with tons of indexes Is there something Im missing with my configuration in order to have single nodes doing more work p  pAlso Is there any metric for knowing when an HTTPonly node is overloaded Right now I have one node devoted to HTTP only, but aside from CPU usage, I cant tell if its doing OK or not. When is it time to start additional HTTP nodes and split up your indexing software to point to the various nodesp

So what I see in log, I have simultaneous start of postback and saveAllFilt. Postback however delays and does nothing before Ajax call in saveAllFilt fninshes.p  pI wonder if there is a way to do like this 1. onClientClick, system goes into saveAllFilt JS function and somehow waits till Ajax function finishes in this or that way. 2. Only when it is finished, a real postback starts to happen.p  pI do realise that JQuery ajax call is eventdriven and asynchronous. Just would like to block these postback actions till it finishes AJAX call prepares data for retrieval that happens via server postback.p

Negative 567 pSo, I understand the general abstract concept of a buffer Its an allocation in memory that holds data before it gets processed. Im trying to complete a homework problem which requires me to write an ASCII string into a buffer within a procedure. So, I understand that Im supposed to pass an address of an array to the procedure when calling it, for example...p  precodemain PROC mov EAX, packed            pass a packed decimal to EAX mov ESI, OFFSET ascArray   pass the offset of an empty array to ESI call    PackedToAsc            call the function codepre  pSo the function is supposed to return a pointer to a buffer with the ASCII decimal string. Im probably being stupid here, but Im not quite clear on what exactly a buffer is in this instance. Is it an array Do I need to declare it as such in the .data section How do I declare the pointer to the ASCII string inside the procedure What is meant by a buffer in this context More practically, I need to access the buffer that the data is put into when the procedure finishes, and Im not sure how to do that. Sorry if Im not being clear enough here... let me know how I can clarify the question.p  pstrongEDITstrong  nbspnbsp  nbsp Im in x86, and Im using MASM. p

Negative 567 pIm working in .NET 4 in C.

Negative 567 pIve been working on a jQuery mobile web app written in Ruby on Rails, and would like to make it available as a native Android app. Ive setup the phonegap project to load my url, and everything seems to be working, but Ive been reading that Google will reject the app if its simply a webview container to an external url. Has anyone had any experience with thisp  pFrom what I can tell, Ill need to rewrite the web app to use ajax calls to populate the page, as opposed to relying solely on web requests to my web server. Can anyone offer any insight into this Would they accept a PhoneGap app that simply loads an external url Any help is appreciated.p  pstrongUpdate1strong Ive also read that being able to handle no internet connection is one of the main reasons they will approvereject your app. I think this could be handled in the android app with some logic that checks for an internet connection, and if it exists, load the external url, if it doesnt load a local html splash page. Would this idea be okp  pstrongUpdate2strong Would it be an option to have a skeleton of the app as basic html files within the phone gap app, which just uses ajax to pull down all of the main html That way the app would still function without an internet connection, but you could also make large changes to the content of the pages which would be pulled down in every request. Is that a viable optionp

Now if I switch it top  precodestdlistltint, stdallocatorltintgtgt theListstdallocatorltintgt theList.pushback1 codepre  pVisual Studio 2012 fails to compile it with error C2228 left of .pushback must have classstructunion. Of course stdlist has a constructor which takes a const reference to an allocator. But if i change it top  precodestdlistltint, stdallocatorltintgtgt theList  stdlistltint, stdallocatorltintgtgtstdallocatorltintgt theList.pushback1 codepre  pall is fine. Why is the second part failing To add to the strangeness of the situation, when trying to return theList by valuep  precodetypedef stdlistltint, stdallocatorltintgtgt TempType  TempType func      TempType theListstdallocatorltintgt     return theList  codepre  pI get error C2664 stdlistltTy,Alloclistconst stdlistltTy,emAlloc amp  cannot convert parameter 1 from TempType emcdecl stdallocatorltemTy emcdecl void to const stdlistltTy,Alloc amp. Looks like the compiler treats the list as a function declaration. Any idea why that could bep

Negative 567 pI have a codeUITextViewcode that is parsed and has its attributes changed when certain characters are typed. The text is not changed, only the attributes that describe the texts formatting. p  pIf I parse on every character entry, Im essentially grabbing the codetextcode, creating an attributed string with the right formatting, and setting the codeattributedTextcode property of the textview to my new attributed string.

Negative 567 pIm working in an Android application to collect data through forms... So, I have two important dates to synchronize the data collected to my server a Period of Synchronization, which takes values like WEEKLY, MONTHLY, etc... and b Date of Campaign Finalization, which takes also the values WEEKLY, MONTHLY, etc but it also can take values specified by the user... however, b must be higher or equal to a...A campaign can have several periods of synchronization...p  pSo, to a, if its value is WEEKLY, I have to take the system date and then calculate the date 7 days forward... For b I always have the date specified... When a is reached, then the app must synchronize the data collected and forbid the edition of the forms or delete the data collected if specified... When b is reached, then the app must synchronize the data collected and delete them on purpose... If a is higher than b as a result of date calculation, a has to take the same value than b and the event related to b is triggered...p  pWhat I want to do now is to schedule two task one for a and one for b. This procedures have to be activated once the devices operator synchronizes for the first time data from the server. And they must executed in background, because they do a HTTP connection.p  pCan anyone guide me through this Which is the best way to do this I have read a lot about AlarmManager but all the examples I read are too simple and for notifications... Please help Is kind of urgentp

Negative 567 pI dont know if its the late hour or if Im just being stupid, but I cant figure this out.p  pWhat Im trying to do is position a background image emjustem outside the element it belongs to using . The reason I want to do is is so that I can later animate the backgroundposition from this  to 50 having it slide in.p  pIf I could use pixels its easy enough to set the codebackgroundpositioncode to code[widthofelement]px 0code but as I want the elements final position to be code50 0code I cant start with a pixel value. Im using the jQuery Background Position plugin btw a hrefhttpkeithwood.namebackgroundPos.html relnofollowhttpkeithwood.namebackgroundPos.htmla.p  pSo, my question is, knowing the width of the element emandem the width of the background image  how can I calculate which age is needed to position the image emjustem outside the edge of the elementp  pObviously setting the background position to 0 0 makes it render at the top left, 50 0 makes it centered and 100 0 positions it from the right edge. If I go above 100 it starts to move away from the right edge, and depending on the width of the image and I guess, the element any value from roughly 200 and up is needed to completely shove the background image outside the edge of the element.p  pIf I go the other way around, from 0 and downward the image moves off to the right, again the  needed to hide it varies but is emnotem the same as the positive  needed to push it off the other edge.p  pAgain, maybe Im just tired but Im stuck here.p  pa hrefhttpjsfiddle.netcTeEA relnofollowhttpjsfiddle.netcTeEAap  pEdit Another curious thing I noticed is that if the image is emsmallerem than the containing element, increasing its backgroundpositionx above 100 doesnt make it move away from the right instead it makes it move emto the rightem.

The C code is working as far as I can tell using the Microsoft.Web.Administration.dll reference  A short examplep  precodeServerManager manager  new ServerManager manager.ApplicationPools[DefaultAppPool].ProcessModel.IdleTimeout  new TimeSpan0, 5, 0 codepre  pWhile debugging the code, IdleTimeout is showing a value of 000500 which should be correct per the code above.p  pHowever, if I go into IIS after this setting has been updated and saved, and go to the Advanced Settings section of the DefaultAppPool, I see the timeout is still set to the default 20.  Is this supposed to change in IIS when I set the variable like I am above  Ive been doing a lot of Googling this afternoon, but I cant seem to find an answer to this.  Hopefully Im just doing something wrong.  Any insight is greatly appreciated  My goal is to be able to set the DefaultAppPools IdleTimeout inside C code.p

Negative 567 pI have a Scala application which I usually run like sbt run. Now I packaged whole project to a .WAR file via sbt package. Then I put the file into webapps directory and restarted Jetty.

Negative 567 pI have a few strongbasicstrong algorithms DCTIDCT and a few others ported and working as expected atleast functionally on Nexus 10. Since these algorithms are first implementations, their execution time is currently running into secs, which is understandable. p  pHowever, given the architecture of Renderscript, I see that these algorithms run either on CPU or GPU depending on other parallel application activities. For instance, in my application, there is a scrollview for images and any activity on this view, essentially pushes the renderscript execution to CPU. If there is no activity the algorithm runs on GPU. I see this live via ARMDS5 MaliA15 traces.p  pThis situation is presenting itself as debugtuning nightmare, since the performance delta when the algorithm runs on CPU dual core versus GPU Mali is of the order of 2 secs, making it very difficult to gauge the performance improvements that I am doing on my algorithm code.p  pis there a way to get around this problem One possible solution is to atleast have a debug configurability option to choose the target type ARM, GPU for renderscript codep

Negative 567 pThis part of the code is supposed to show an area with multiple overlapping images. Each layer has a set of image options, so layers can be mixed.p  pstrongProblemstrong I have a problem with these overlapping images in Chrome. They are positioned absolute and with set zindexes. They show as expected in normal browser size but when increasing the area for these images some disappear and show white blocks. This only occurs in Chrome. I want to make sure this is future proof for large displays. p  pI am using GPU acceleration with webkittransform translateZ0 to speed up the app. Removing this makes all layers show even on large window size in chrome. However, this slows the app down and does not fix the whole problem. This makes me want to keep the transform translate. When transform translate is off, layer images still disappear and show white when switching even some of the layers that were not swithched image for one layer. p  pOnly the currently shown image layers are included in the DOM, and when one is switched a clone of the just recent image layer is shown in front while loading the newly selected image layer behind. p  pThe image sizes are 2048px by 1344px on large screens and scaled to fit the window but not beyond that.

Negative 567 pSo, Im getting a heap corruption error in the Expand method for an Ordered List Class Im working on. The expand method is called when the client tries to Insert a new item into the list, and there isnt currently room left in the array. When I take the delete line out, the program runs fine, but I know I have an inaccessible object each time it expands. However, when I put the delete line in, the program explodes at runtime.p  pAdditionally, this only happens in my Expand method. It doesnt do this in my Contract method, which is called each time there is a deletion from the list that brings the number of list elements down below 14 the total space currently available, it cuts the size in half. I can delete the old list in this method without any problems.p  pGetListPtr, SetListPtr, and GetLength are all inherited from a ListClass object, which I received in the form of a header file and object code, so Im not sure exactly how they work. ItemType is a struct, only containing an integer field, key.p  pIve read a number of questions on here already and didnt find any that seemed to provide any help in regards to my situation.p  precodevoid OrdListClassExpand      ItemType newList  new ItemType[size  2]     ItemType temp  GetListPtr      size  size  2       Copy the current list to the new list.     forint i  0 i lt GetLength i         newList[i]  temp[i]       Point to the new list.

Negative 567 pI have a web app that needs to be within a container of a fixed size. I want that container to always be completely visible on the screen of mobile devices. Particularly I care about iPads. In my case, the container is 1000px wide by 650px tall. Essentially, I need something that would be the functional equivalent of codeltmeta nameviewport contentminwidth1000, minheight650gtcode. But codeminwidthcode and codeminheightcode arent valid in a viewport meta tag.p  pI already have the page laid out such that if the window or viewport has extra room the content is displayed centered on the page. Ive tried using the codeorientationchangecode event to change the codecontentcode attribute of my codemetacode tag, but no luck. With some configurations that Ive tried it loads correctly initially sometimes, refreshing or reopening the page often yields different results but upon changing orientation it becomes incorrect.p  pThis is the closest Ive come to getting it to work in the codewindow.onOrientationChangecode eventp  precodevar mvp  document.getElementByIdmyViewport ifwindow.innerWidth  window.innerHeight gt 1000  650      mvp.setAttributecontent,userscalableyes, height650  else      mvp.setAttributecontent,userscalableyes, width1000  codepre  pWhere of course codemyViewportcode is my viewport meta tag. This works correctly in portrait although when switching back and forth I have to manually zoom back out, but doesnt add the extra width needed to zoom out to see the full app height in landscape. Also, Id prefer not to allow users to zoom in and out because of the nature of the app, and certainly dont want to require them to zoom out every time they change orientation.p  pIf there is a way to force the zoom to always fit to screen, something akin to codeminimumscaleauto, maximumscaleautocode, it seems like that would work if I could get the width correct in landscape, but I dont know of such a mechanism. I also tried using javascript to determine the scale, based on codewindow.outerHeightcode or codewindow.outerWidthcode depending on which one is the determining factor, but that wasnt successful either.p  pAnd please dont tell me that this is bad design, because the specs come from the client for their internaluse app and theres nothing I can do about them.p

Negative 567 pI have a picture gallery that is composed of polaroidlike pictures that are randomly thrown on the screen with different rotates and translates each. When I hover over an image, it scales x2, it comes to front with zindex and gets a rotation of 0. Now here comes the problem when you click the topright of the pictures, it does a 3d card flip and on the back it has a comment section. However, the card flickers badly because of the backgroundcolor of the card div, and worse, when clicking the comment section, it dissapers behind the background color. This happens only in Chrome. I have tried different solutions, with translateZ1px and changing backfacevisibility of different divs, but it doesnt work. It only works if I remove the background color of the card, but everything besides the image becomes transparent and this, of course, is not what I want.p  pHere is the fiddle a hrefhttpjsfiddle.net4Tw3s1 relnofollowhttpjsfiddle.net4Tw3s1ap  pstrongThe flips CSSstrongp  precode.artGroup.flip      webkitperspective800px     mozperspective800px     msperspective800px     operspective800px     perspective800px  .artGroup.flip .artwork      webkittransition webkittransform 1s     moztransition moztransform 1s     mstransition mstransform 1s     otransition otransform 1s     transition transform 1s     webkittransformstyle preserve3d     moztransformstyle preserve3d     mstransformstyle preserve3d     otransformstyle preserve3d     transformstyle preserve3d  .artGroup.flip .detail, .artGroup.flip .theFlip      webkittransform rotateY180deg      moztransform rotateY180deg      mstransform rotateY180deg      otransform rotateY180deg      transform rotateY180deg    .artGroup.flip img, .artGroup.flip .detail, .aaa, .bbb, .nota, .nrpoza     webkitbackfacevisibility hidden     mozbackfacevisibility hidden     msbackfacevisibility hidden     obackfacevisibility hidden     backfacevisibility hidden  codepre  pstrongHTMLstrongp  precodeltdiv idtheArtgt     ltdiv classartGroup slidegt       ltdiv classartworkgt           ltimg classmare srchttpapi.ning.comfilesSgY6AwQoVTrUyj0n7j9R5MHqRWf5ECVRbqLx7BTEScSgnOClKrLdK72nGe8X8koNM70oYq2kVtHH0RbauTHTfLqkLnEWi13365705hJ600x400.jpgwidth600ampheight400gt             ltdiv classnotagtltbgtSome description here.ltbgtltdivgt             ltdiv classnrpozagt55ltdivgt             ltdiv classaaa stylepositionabsolute displayblock left520px top20px background rgba255, 255, 255, .3 borderradius37px padding7pxgtltimg classmica srchttpi.i.cbsi.comcnwk.1ditim20110316Chromelogo20110316.jpggtltdivgt          ltdiv classdetailgt             ltdiv classbbb stylepositionabsolute displayblock left520px top20px background rgba211, 211, 211, .3 borderradius37px padding7px width60pxgtltimg classmica srchttpi.i.cbsi.comcnwk.1ditim20110316Chromelogo20110316.jpg stylewidth60pxgtltdivgt             Some comment section here          ltdivgt       ltdivgt     ltdivgt ltdivgt codepre  pstrongAnd the Jquerystrongp  precodedocument.readyfunction         function NumarRandommin, max            return Math.floorMath.random  max  min  1  min                  function NumarRandommin, max            return Math.floorMath.random  max  min  1  min                  .artGroup.eachfunction             this.css                  webkittransformrotateNumarRandom70,70deg scale0.5,                 moztransformrotateNumarRandom70,70deg scale0.5,                 otransformrotateNumarRandom70,70deg scale0.5,                 transformrotateNumarRandom70,70deg scale0.5                          this.animateleftNumarRandom000,100,topNumarRandom0,100              this.hover                 function this.csswebkittransformrotate0deg, webkittransformscale1,                 function this.csswebkittransformrotateNumarRandom80,80deg scale0.5                           if html.hasClasscsstransforms3d                  .artGroup.removeClassslide.addClassflip              .artGroup.flip .aaa.click                 function                       this.parent.addClasstheFlip                                           .artGroup.flip .bbb.click                 function                       this.parent.parent.removeClasstheFlip                                         else              .artGroup.hover                 function                       this.find.detail.stop.animatebottom0, 500, easeOutCubic                 ,                 function                       this.find.detail.stop.animatebottom this.height  1 , 500, easeOutCubic                                                         codepre  pPlease help me with a solution for this, because I ran out of ideas.

Negative 567 pI am quite new to htmlcss, and I spent some time writing my own website from scratch. I have understood the very basics of the thing, but many subtleties are still unclear in my mind. Currently, I am unable to achieve a specific feature on my website, and I was hoping that maybe some of you would come up with a simple solution.p  pa hrefhttps1319.photobucket.comuserJonathanViqueratmedia2zpsac6a873d.png.html relnofollowHerea is what my website looks like the colors are here to make things clearer. The four blocks converge toward the focal point. The top left part Research interests is dedicated to contain short descriptions, while the top right part PhD thesis is dedicated to contain either large texts or pictures. From now on, I will only focus on the top right part, where my problem occurs.p  pGreen part p  precodemaindisplay      display inlineblock     position relative     textalign left     width 66.6     height 80.0     float right     backgroundcolor green  codepre  pRed part p  precodemaindisplay article      backgroundcolor red     fontfamily Convverdana, sansserif     display inlineblock     position relative     marginleft 1.5     top 10     width 70.0     height 75.0     overflow auto  codepre  pDark gray part p  precodemaindisplay p      backgroundcolor gray     fontweight normal     fontsize 90     position absolute     bottom 30px  codepre  pI get my bottom alignment for the maindisplay paragraphs by absolute positioning them inside the relative positioned article and therefore, the overflow auto is here totally useless. When the text is short enough, this works like a charm and the result is emexactlyem what I want it to be. However, when the text is longer, or when the screen is smaller typically, my laptop, I would like things to look like a hrefhttps1319.photobucket.comuserJonathanViqueratmedia3zps062fda1d.png.html relnofollowthisa  the top of the text appears first, and a scroll bar is available. When the text is scrolled to the bottom, the bottom of the scrolled text is aligned with the bottom of the top left part, as it is in the first picture. This is achieved by setting p  precodemaindisplay p      backgroundcolor gray     fontweight normal     fontsize 90     position relative     margin 0     padding 0     bottom 0  codepre  pSo here is my problem  I would like the first behavior when the text is short enough, and the second behavior when it is longer than the maindisplay article div. I was hoping that this could be done in a cssonly way but I have looked for quite some time and now I am unsure about this please note that I know precisely nothing about the javascriptjquery stuff. I am not allergic to tables, but I just dont see how to use them here.p  pPlease let me know if there is anything unclear about this, and thanks in advance for your answers p

Does anyone know why this is happening and how I can avoid itp  pEDIT It gives me a warning about the change from protected to public, indicating that the protected status gets overwritten by the public one. Also I have done this exact thing before and not gotten that error, which I find odd. And I can definitely forward declare enums, but even moving sections around so that I dont need to didnt solve it. Apparently I can compile the program with half the code unfinished and it worked, but the error is still there. So I guess the compiler thinks it is fine, just not Visual Studio.p

Negative 567 pI think I understand the basics of requiring and including modules in Ruby on Rails, but I cant figure out whats going on with an issue Im having.  Im using Ruby 1.9.3 with Rails 3.2.1.p  pI have a module called Utils in libutils.rb, which currently just has some logging functions in it.  In most other files in the app, Im able to execute the following code and use the logger without any problemp  precodelogger  UtilsSingletonLogger.getlogger codepre  pNote that in model code, I generally use an instance variable instead of a local variable, and that seems to work fine as well.p  pAlso note that this does NOT require me to havep  precodeinclude Utils codepre  pin the code.p  pThe problem is that, in at least one controller, I have to explicitly require and include the module before it will work.  Well, usually anyway.  Most of the time I get a NameError because it doesnt recognize Utils as a constant.  Other times, it throws a ransack error.  And once it a great while, it just works.  If I add just the eminclude Utilsem line, I get a similar NameError, though with a shorter error message. p  pAnd best of all, this only happens in the test environment, and not in my local dev instance.p  pFor now, Ive commented out all the logging in this one file, but Id like to understand whats going on.  Ive added p  precodeconfig.autoloadoncepaths  Wconfig.rootlib codepre  pto application.rb, thinking this would insure that the actual code is available to any file in the application.  I guess Im supposed to needp  precodeinclude Utils codepre  pin every file that uses this module, but I dont understand why that doesnt seem to be required in other files, or why I should have to reemrequireem the module file in this controller.p  pId appreciate any insight or guidance.p  pBriefly  emrequireloadem reads the modules actual source code file into memory, emincludeem makes the modules methods available in a different file.  I assume that I really only want to emrequireloadem a file once per instance of the application  that having it executed every time a new class is used is unsightly at best, and inefficient at worst.p
Negative 567 pUsing the traditional, sequential reduction approach, the following graph is reduced asp  precode  1 2  3 4 gt  3  3 4 gt  3 7 gt 10 codepre  pGraph reductions are, though, inherently parallel. One could, instead, reduce it asp  precode  1 2  3 4 gt  3 7 gt 10 codepre  pAs far as I know, every functional programming language uses the first approach. I believe this is mostly because, on the CPU, scheduling threads overcompensate the benefits of doing parallel reductions.

If a language ran strongentirely on the GPUstrong, those communication costs would vanish.p  pAre there functional languages making use of that ideap

Negative 567 pIm passing 12 MB of data from one process to another, using a plain old file. Is it significantly slower than going through RAM entirelyp  pBefore answering yes, please keep in mind that in modern Linux at least, when writing a file it is actually written to RAM, and then a daemon syncs the data to disk from time to time. So in that way, if process A writes a 12 MB into a file, then process B reads them within 12 seconds, process B would simply read the cached memory. It gets even better than that, because in Linux, there is a grace period of a few seconds before a new file is written to the hard disk, so if the file is deleted, its not written at all to the hard disk. This makes passing data through files as fast as passing them through RAM.p  pNow that is Linux, is it so in Windowsp  pstrongEditstrong Just to lay out some assumptionsp  ol liThe OS is reasonably new  Windows XP or newer for desktops, Windows Server 2003 or newer for servers.li liThe file is significantly smaller than available RAM  lets say less than 1 of available RAM.li liThe file is read and deleted a few seconds after it has been written.li ol
Negative 567 pSo, right now Im grabbing the accelerometer data and converting them to a decently rough estimate of the angle at which the phone is being held. For right now Im just focused on the yaw axis. p  pMy area of interest is between 0 and 45 degrees on the yaw axis, so I made a limited queue of the past 5 to 10 readings and compared the numbers to determine if its going up or down, which kind of works, but it is slow and not really as precise or reliable as Id want it to be.p  pIs there a way you can kind of just determine which direction your phone is rotating with just the accelerometer and the magnetic field sensor I guess, without keeping a history of past readings, or something like that Im really new to sensor manipulation and Android in general.

The first item printed is always 0, or in other words, it is always the first item in the original list. I cant figure out why this is happening, perhaps because the item has already been selected before the shuffle function is called. If that is the case, shuffling the list before the forloop results in the list being shuffled only once, instead of being shuffled after each item is printed.p  pAnyone know how I might shuffle that first item before its printed Thanksp

Negative 567 pI am trying to write a program in C to read, manipulate, and update my database.  I am having a problem inserting my data into mongo.  So for my work flow, I get some type of request to update a document.  I query the document, and update the data.  I then try to do an update on the document.  p  pI have a function that converts my class object to a BSONObj through a BSONObjBuilder.  I seem to be having a problem with large arrays of subobjects. For example, I have a field in my document called geo that looks like thisp  pcodegeo [postal 10012,postal10013,...,postal90210]codep  pand is stored in C asp  pcodestdvectorltmongoBSONObjgt geocodep  pthis field might have thousands of postal codes in it. When doing p  pcodedb.getgtupdatedb.collection,BSONidltltid, BSONsetltltupdateObjcodep  pwhere updateObj is the obj I got from my BSONObjBuilder, nothing is updated in mongo. If I remove the geo field, everything is inserted. p  pI tried to just dop  precodedb.getgtupdatedb.collection,BSONidltltid, BSONsetltltBSONgeo ltlt geo codepre  pthinking maybe it necessary to do separate queries due to the size of the obj and this also result in no update.p  pI was wondering if somehow I was hitting some sort of BSON size limit in C.  p  pThe only reason I believe it is a size limit is because while trying to debug this problem, I tried to call updateObj.toString in order to print out the object I was trying to insert and it threw an exception codeElement extends past end of objectcode.  I assume that this means I hit some type of max size of an objectelement.  p  pAny insight into this problem will be greatly appreciated.p  pThank youp

I have tried installing everything through MacPorts, and it seemed to work, but when I tried to use it, the compiler told me that there was no netcdf.mod file, and sure enough there wasnt one to be found anywhere.  It turns out that just typingp  precodesudo port install netcdffortran codepre  ponly installs the library files, but doesnt create a .mod file, which I guess is needed. So I found out that other people had the same problem, and the advice given was to install it with gcc44, which did create a .mod file, but then my compiler told me that the .mod file was built with a different version of gfortran and it couldnt be used, so thats why I am trying to build it from scratch, but if someone has a faster option, I would be more than happy to try itp

Negative 567 pIve been looking for a bit on Google and havent been able to find this specific case of regex.

This means that if there is one word, the other should be also present in the phrase in any order.p  pFor examplep  pre classlangnone prettyprintoverridecodeasdasdadadasd           gt shouldnt work asdasdasdaasdasdasda   gt should work sdasdadasDATEHOUR gt should work DATEHOUR              gt should work sdasdadasHOURDATE  gt should work sdasdadasDATE         gt should work codepre  pThis is as far as Ive gone code..bHOURb.bDATEb.code.p  pBut that expression doesnt quite work.p

Negative 567 pIm teaching myself to analyze malware, and in order to increase my understanding of some of the more common antidebugging techniques, I wrote the codeint 2dcode debugger detection concept in assembly. However, when it reaches the codeint 2dcode, the program terminates rather than skipping the expected opcode. Here is my codep  precodeinclude win32ax.inc  .data dbg db Debugger,0 nodbg db No debugger,0  .code start xor eax,eax    set the zero flag int 2dh        The debugger detection interupt  inc eax        the instruction to be skipped during debugging jnz notpresent the jump  invoke MessageBox,0,dbg,dbg,MBOK Debugger detected jmp exit  notpresent invoke MessageBox,0,nodbg,nodbg,MBOK No debugger detected  exit invoke ExitProcess,0 .end start codepre  pWhat it should have done was jumped to the MessageBox saying No debugger, instead, when it reaches the codeint 2dcode opcode, the program crashes even when not being debugged. Any helpful tips What have I done wrong and how can I fix it Im using The Flat Assembler, if that helps.p

In my app, this line does not appear, so the user does not notice that its possible to drop a category between two others. p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comkwqZW.png altenter image description here img srchttpi.stack.imgur.comI1PoC.png altenter image description herep  pMy code p  precodesorting.jstree     core          data              url pathPrefixAjaxsysSortingPopupContent,             data function node                  return                      idTop  node.id    node.id  0                                       ,         checkcallback true,         themes              theme default,             dots true,             stripes true              ,     plugins [ dnd ]  codepre  pAnother interesting thing is, that, even though the angle does not appear, I can move the categories to the desired place.

Negative 567 pWe use TypeScript a lot in ASP.Net MVC projects for implementing the clientside code MVVM, Ajax, etc. We always face the problem that TypeScriptJavascript code is out of sync with C servercode as R and other Tools dont get over the technology gap from C to TypeScript. p  pFor example when the server returns JSON objects and one of the fields get renamed one need to search the whole TS sourcecode and renamed it there by hand otherwise the client doesnt work as expected anymore. This also adresses MVVM pattern where the HTML markup and therefore the binding is generated by RazorC and the clientviewmodel by TypeScript. Same problem. p  pOne solution to this that cam in mind is a TypeScript PreProcessor or Macros. It would be very cool if I can mix C code eg. constants like fieldpropertynames into the TypeScript code. This stuff gets updated each time before the TS compiler starts and does generate the TS sourcecode before it get to the TS compiler. p  pIs may be a way to bridge the technologygap and may allow to fix a lot of problems because the same constants eg. names can be used in serverside C code as well as in clientside TS code. Same would apply to plain Javascript code instead of TypeScript. p  pDoes anything like this already exists How did you handle that gap between client and server code How to keep things in sync Any feedback to such an approach p  pCheers,  Marcp

Negative 567 pIn my ASP.NET MVC 4 project, I have a .json file containing geographical data for D3.js in my AppData folder that I want to load up into D3.p  pSo far, the approach Ive been using is to have jQuery perform an AJAX call to some controller returning a JsonResult, and on success, store the JSON in some variable and pass it into D3.

Negative 567 pI have been playing with Aeson and the lens package lensaeson, migrated from the core lens package, and have been sruggling to get them to work together.p  pAs a toy example, I have a typep  precodedata Colour  Yellow  Green  Blue codepre  pand the FromJSON instancep  precodeinstance FromJSON Colour where     parseJSON String s  return  case s of         blue gt Blue         green gt Green          gt Yellow     parseJSON   mzero codepre  pSo far so good.p  pNow, say I have some nested JSON data come in that I want to extract just this out ofp  precode     info          colour yellow     ,      other props   codepre  pI dont care about the rest, only this colour value. To make matters worse, lets say that the JSON isnt particularly consistent, so sometimes I havep  precode item  colour yellow   codepre  pand other timesp  precode random itemcolour yellow  codepre  pI want to be able to get at the colour value as easily as possible, and then parse it ideally using my FromJSON instance ideally into a colour. This is a toy example, but instead of Colour the data type might have a number of fields etc.p  pI started looking at the lensaeson stuff and that got my hopes up it allows very easy peering into a JSON structure. examplep  precodegt  info  colour yellow    key info . key colour Just String yellow gt  info  colour yellow    key info . key colour . String Just yellow codepre  pBut I cant find a way to run that through my parseJSON call to get back codeJust Yellowcode. parseJSON seems close in that it takes the right type thing inside the maybe as least but then falls apart after that. Ideally Id be able to do something like one ofp  precodegt  info  colour yellow    key info . key colour . ParseJSON  Maybe Colour Just Yellow gt  info  colour yellow    key info . key colour . Colour Just Yellow codepre  pThe closest Ive come to figuring it out is reencoding then decoding the result of the above, egp  precodegt encode   info  colour yellow    key info . key colour yellow codepre  pwhich gives me back the bit of JSON encoded data I want. In a more complex case, if that data was an object or array, I could then run codedecodecode on it as I would normally to get back my more complex type, but decode doesnt like improper JSON things that arent wrapped in array or object syntax. In addition, doing decode then encode seems horribly messy and not very performant.p  pI am rather new to lenses and Aeson as a whole and Haskell for that matter, though Ive come to understand things like monadsapplicatives on the whole so slowly making progress. How would you guys go about getting this donep  pMy general motivation is that I will be working with a load of JSON data, but actually only care about fragments of it, and would thus rather avoid declaring a data type each time I need to get those fragments out from different places in the JSON, and instead just declare types for the bits I care about.p  pNote that I am using lensaeson1 and lens4.4.0.1, rather than aesonlens which works a little differently it might be relevant in answersp  pThanks in advance Jamesp

When I move back to my development machine and deliberately use the 192.168.0.1 address which isnt even an address that exists in the development network the program operates perfectly again, as it is just connecting to localhost. Even though I specified an IP address.p  pI know that when I connect to mysql via command line mysql hlocalhost it defaults to using a pipe instead of a socket such as if I used mysql h127.0.0.1. I may have those backwards.. But it appears to be doing that. Its completely ignoring the IP and connecting via the local pipe. What on earth am I doing wrongp  pI hope I explained that correctly. And I hope its a stupid simple mistake that is obvious. Thank you guys.p  pNote addresses changed for security purposesp  pEDITp  pInterestingly I ran codestringscode on the binary and it didnt output the DNS address I put in as a response to the most recent post. This suggests to me maybe something about the compile process. For some reason it is seeing the string I am entering as perhaps NULL and automatically converts it to localhost in the binary. p  pIt appears to be a problem either with the compile or my source. But I dont see why it would be interpreting my string incorrectly and replacing it I guess on the assumption that it is unreadable or NULL.p  pWhat am I doing wrong p  pEDIT Ok Im an idiot.

Negative 567 pTLDR My console application runs if I click on it manually however it does not run when called by service while using StartProcess or Shell.p  pCould this be a permission issuep  pDetails Ive written a small windows service application that checks a remote location folder for a product key and updates the local machine if the product key is different than what is entered. I thought this would be a simple project for my first foray into windows services. p  pThe service runs using a timer every hour for testing the interval is every 30 seconds. Originally the service would perform the updating but I ran into a more complicated issue accessing the UNC path I would have to use Impersonation Classes. p  pSo while testing the code in a console version of the application, I noticed it was able to access the network location without supplying credentials.

Negative 567 pI have a jQuery plugin named codeshowLoadingcode which shows AJAX loading indicators on top of desired Elements.  It can be ran multiple times at once on different parts of the screen.  It also allows you to pass in a codebeforeShowcode Callback Function and a codeafterShowcode Callback Function.p  pBelow is an example of how I am trying to plugin to it and show an addition Fixed DIV across the top of the screen to show when my AJAX scripts are processing as sometimes these targeted elements that show the loading indicators are hidden out of view on the screen.p  pMy callback function works and inserts a new DIV at the top of the screen when this other script triggers it, however the problem seems to be since it can be called multiple times within less than a second and with different ones ending at different times, it seems that the codeafterShowcode callback function ends up getting called before you can even see the loading DIV I am adding to the top of the screenp  pMy question, is there anyway to somehow make my DIV get inserted into the page the first time the codebeforeShowcode is fired and then somehow prevent it from being removed as soon as codeafterShowcode is called...the catch is, it does need to eventually be removed from screen.  Im not sure there is a 100 good way to achieve this even.  p  pOne method in mind is to use some sort of timer but that would almost seem useless as it would then be so inaccurate on a fast processing vs long processing action.p  pI can try to set up a demo but I am curious if this is even really possible and what the options arep  precode 3rd party jQuery script that shows AJAX loading indicators all over the screen and is called multiple times on some pages for different areas of the screen.

Negative 567 pI have created a program which outputs approximately 300,000 rows of data per day to store in a database.

Negative 567 pI need a bitfield column in my MySQL database and I heard from the datatype codeBITMcode where M is the number of bits and of course there is the datatype codeUNSIGNED INTEGERcode which holds 32 bits 0  21.p  pOf course, for a bitfield, codeBITcode is better because I can set the number of bytes exactly as high as necessary. But I need to access the bitfield using JDBC and I could not find a good way to read and set bitfields from JDBC.p  pIs it in this case just better to use the codeUNSIGNEDcode datatype whichs size is next to the wished bitfield size For JDBC it would simplify everything. But are there any serious performancediskspace drawbacksp

Negative 567 pIm working on a Perl app thats intended to be deployed using codeModuleBuildcode. Ive need to install a number of modules through CPAN because they werent available through Ubuntus package manageror, more correctly, the internal aptget mirror all our servers use. While this is all well and good on our development server, IT is understandably reluctant to run code on production machines that isnt cached or otherwise controlled inhouse.p  pAs we dont currently have a CPAN mirror, this basically means that I need to get all of these nonUbuntu modules into one place so they can be archived andor committed to version control. The ideal solution would be to check the utility out from source control, change a couple config variables for databases and such, maybe run a buildinstall command, and be done. Fortunately, the development server is a clone of the production server, so modules using XS or other architecturespecific features shouldnt cause an issue.p  pI think the cleanest way to handle this would be checking in source tarballs for the modules I need and setting codeModuleBuildcode to use those to resolve its dependencies instead of looking to CPAN, but I dont see an option for that. Is this something thats doable, or is there another way to round up all the modules I need for an essentially offline deploymentp

What I want is for the legend to appear under that chart but fill the width given. My issue is it seems that the number of columns for the legend is set once and unable to be updated. So if I a chart that covers the entire width of the page I want to be able to show a larger number of columns, but if the chart only has a small amount of width space I would like it to use less columns. I can capture the width and figure out the number of columns I would like but is it possible to redraw the legend dynamically Thanks for the helpp

Negative 567 pWe currently about 60 repositories in our project, with the number increasing each week. They are all basic CRUD repositories that hit a database. In order to simplify them and write less WET, I wanted to build out a generic repository that could handle our most common usecase. Ive got the following two generic repository interfacesp  precodepublic interface ILookupRepositoryltTgt  IRepository where T  class, new      TaskltIEnumerableltTgtgt GetAllISharedConnection connection  null      TaskltTgt GetByIdint id, ISharedConnection connection  null   public interface ICrudRepositoryltTgt  ILookupRepositoryltTgt where T  class, new      Taskltintgt SaveT item, ISharedConnection connection  null      Task DeleteT item, ISharedConnection connection  null  codepre  pAll of our Sql is done through stored procedures and Im using Dapper to execute the stored procedures. I created a generic repository shown below as codeGenericRepositorycode that handles mapping model properties to columns and whatnot with Dapper. I omitted the codeGenericRepositorycode code.p  pThe following code is the implementation of the two above interfaces.p  precodepublic abstract class LookupRepositoryltTgt  ILookupRepositoryltTgt where T  class, new      public LookupRepository              this.SqlRepository  new GenericRepository           protected GenericRepository SqlRepository  get private set       public async virtual TaskltTgt GetByIdint formId, ISharedConnection sharedConnection  null              return await SqlRepository.GetSingleItembyIdAsyncltTgtthis.GetProcedureNameGet, ById, formId, sharedConnection           public async virtual TaskltIEnumerableltTgtgt GetAllISharedConnection connection  null              return await SqlRepository.GetAllItemsAsyncltTgtthis.GetProcedureNameGet, connection           protected virtual string GetProcedureNamestring procedureAction, string condition                string storedProcedure  string.IsNullOrWhiteSpacecondition              string.Format0.12, this.GetSchema, procedureAction, typeofT.Name              string.Format0.123, this.GetSchema, procedureAction, typeofT.Name, condition          return storedProcedure            ltsummarygt      Gets the schema that this repository must use when talking to the database.      ltsummarygt      ltreturnsgtReturns the schema prefixltreturnsgt     protected abstract string GetSchema   public abstract class CrudRepositoryltTgt  LookupRepositoryltTgt, ICrudRepositoryltTgt where T  class, new      public virtual async Taskltintgt SaveT item, ISharedConnection sharedConnection  null              return await SqlRepository.SaveItemltTgtthis.GetProcedureNameSave, item, sharedConnection           public async virtual Task DeleteT item, ISharedConnection sharedConnection  null              await SqlRepository.DeleteItemltTgtthis.GetProcedureNameDelete, item, sharedConnection       codepre  pOur stored procedures and tables use different schema prefixs in the database, I believe we have 8 different schemas at the moment. As an example, I have a codefrmcode schema for long form data tables, codelucode schema for all of our lookup tables etc. All of our stored procedures follow the same naming convention, so the implementation of the above Crud and Lookup repositories dont have to worry about stored proc names.p  pMy codeILookupRepositorycode can always assume it needs to execute a stored procedure in the codelucode schema. The codeICrudRepositorycode does not have that luxury. So the abstract class forces children classes to specify what their schema is. As an example, I have two children classes with their schema specified.p  precodepublic class QuantlistRepositoryBaseltTgt  CrudRepositoryltTgt where T  QuantlistBase, new      protected override string GetSchema              return ql        public class FormRepositoryBaseltTFormgt  CrudRepositoryltTFormgt where TForm  BaseForm, new      protected override string GetSchema              return frm       codepre  pI constrain each child repository to a base model type. At the moment, because the models for the two forms above are children of a base class, I can resolve them using DI at runtime.p  precodeICrudRepositoryltQuantlistgt crudQuantlistRepo  container.ResolveltICrudRepositoryltQuantlistgtgt ICrudRepositoryltEmployeeInterviewgt crudFormRepo  container.ResolveltICrudRepositoryltEmployeeInterviewgtgt codepre  pI register them with the container using autofac by using some reflection during startup and registering the codeICrudRepositorycode with all of the models that inherit from a model meeting the constraint requirement for each codeICrudRepositorycode implementation.p  precodevar logicTypes  AppDomain.CurrentDomain.GetAssemblies     .Firstassem gt assem.FullName.StartsWithPen.Apps.Logic     .GetTypes var repoTypes  AppDomain.CurrentDomain.GetAssemblies     .Firstassem gt assem.FullName.StartsWithPen.Repository.Sql     .GetTypes     .Wheretype gt          type.GetInterfacetypeofICrudRepositoryltgt.Name  null ampamp         type.IsAbstract ampamp         type.IsInterface  var builder  new ContainerBuilder foreachvar r in repoTypes      Type definition  r.GetGenericArguments.First.GetGenericParameterConstraints.First     var repoConstraint  logicTypes.Wheret gt t.IsSubclassOfdefinition      foreachvar constraint in repoConstraint              var genericType  r.MakeGenericTypenew Type[]  constraint          var genericInterfaceType  r.GetInterfacetypeofICrudRepositoryltgt.Name         var typedef  genericInterfaceType.GetGenericTypeDefinition         var genericInterfaceTypeType  typedef.MakeGenericTypenew Type[]  constraint                         var genericRepository  Activator.CreateInstancegenericType         builder.RegisterInstancegenericRepository.AsgenericInterfaceTypeType        IContainer container  builder.Build codepre  pThe problem with this however is that it requires all of my models to inherit from a base class. Ive already got base classes that they need to inherit from, so a baseclass meant specifically to facilitate registering with DI doesnt make any sense. I know I can just register manually each implementation, but there are hundreds of models, and manually registering each one of them and each new one seems redundant when we have reflection and so many patterns available to write the code a litter DRYer.p  pThere are a couple options Im exploring but Im not sure if theyre the best approach.p  ol liUse attributes on each model. Im not a fan of this because now the models have schema info  each model must have the attribute.li liUse a marker interface. This lets me use what ever base class I want to that weve already got wired up with logic. I dont like this much either because Im back to touching models.li liUse a Factory in the Repository level. The Factory would check a given type for its namespace and return the schema appropriate for it. Then Id no longer have children codeFormRepositorycode classes. My CrudRepository would no longer be abstract and it would be what I used with all classes.li ol  pIf I have codeLogic.Diarycode, codeLogic.Diary.Formscode and codeLogic.Materialscode, the factory would return back a schema based on codeDiary, Formscode and codeMaterialscode.p  precodepublic abstract class LookupRepositoryltTgt  ILookupRepositoryltTgt where T  class, new      public LookupRepository              this.SqlRepository  new GenericRepository           protected GenericRepository SqlRepository  get private set       public async virtual TaskltTgt GetByIdint formId, ISharedConnection sharedConnection  null              return await SqlRepository.GetSingleItembyIdAsyncltTgtthis.GetProcedureNameGet, ById, formId, sharedConnection           public async virtual TaskltIEnumerableltTgtgt GetAllISharedConnection connection  null              return await SqlRepository.GetAllItemsAsyncltTgtthis.GetProcedureNameGet, connection           protected virtual string GetProcedureNamestring procedureAction, string condition                string storedProcedure  string.IsNullOrWhiteSpacecondition              string.Format0.12, this.GetSchema, procedureAction, typeofT.Name              string.Format0.123, this.GetSchema, procedureAction, typeofT.Name, condition          return storedProcedure            ltsummarygt      Gets the schema that this repository must use when talking to the database.      ltsummarygt      ltreturnsgtReturns the schema prefixltreturnsgt     protected string GetSchema              switchtypeofT.Namespace.Split..Last                      case Forms                 return frm             case Materials                 return mat                   return dbo        public class CrudRepositoryltTgt  LookupRepositoryltTgt, ICrudRepositoryltTgt where T  class, new      public virtual async Taskltintgt SaveT item, ISharedConnection sharedConnection  null              return await SqlRepository.SaveItemltTgtthis.GetProcedureNameSave, item, sharedConnection           public async virtual Task DeleteT item, ISharedConnection sharedConnection  null              await SqlRepository.DeleteItemltTgtthis.GetProcedureNameDelete, item, sharedConnection       codepre  pI would abstract the codeGetSchemacode out in to a Factory, but to simplify the concept for the post I just did the check in the codeGetSchemacode method within the repository.p  pI dont really want to change my models to facilitate DI registration and repository support, so Im leaning towards option three.

Negative 567 pIm reading some codeRTSPcode stream in an iOS app using codeFFmpegcode.

Negative 567 pso I am fairly new to the Java language, so there must be something here that I am forgetting. So for a homework I have to create a chess game in Java. As of now, I have created a class for a Pawn piece, and another class called GameState, which contains the board for the game. The Pawn class has a method called move which takes the x and y coordinates of the spot on the board to move to, as well as the current gamestate object, and the move function will move the pawn to that spot on the board. The pawn class is extended from an abstract class called Piece, and all the other specific piece classes I make will inherit from this class. p  pMy problem is that the move method is not properly modifying the board in the GameState class.p  pBelow is the relevant snippet of code from the move method of the pawn classp  precodepublic GameState moveGameState state, int xDest, int yDest      Make sure that the destination coordinates are not outside of the board     if xDest lt 0  yDest lt 0  xDest gt state.getBoardCols  yDest gt state.getBoardRows          return null                     A black piece moves forward on the downward pointing y       axis, and a a white piece moves up. Thus, we assign a       1 to the variable if the piece is white, and 1 if the       piece is black.            int dir  color.equalsblack  1  1      In the case that the pawn is moving forward 2 spaces     if firstMove  true ampamp xCurr  xDest ampamp yDest  yCurr  dir  2          if state.insertPiecexDest, yDest, this              firstMove  false              Null the old coordinates the Pawn was at             state.nullCoordinatesxCurr, yCurr                             return state          else             return null      codepre  pso, the insertPiece method is what actually inserts the pawn at the x and y coordinates on the board. I used the eclipse debugger, and when the program is running the insertPiece method, the board of the state object does indeed insert the pawn at the correct x and y coordinates. Now, I have a unit test function which is running this move method, shown herep  precodestate  pawnToTest.movestate, 4, 1  dir  2 assertEqualsfalse, pawnToTest.firstMove assertEqualspawnToTest, state.getPiece4, 1  dir  2 assertEqualsnull, state.getPiece4, 1 codepre  pNow, in this scenario, I have a pawn placed at x4,y1 on the board initially which indexes to [1][4], but whatever. So, the first move call here will move it forward to x4,y3. Now, Ive verified w the debugger that INSIDE the pawnToTest.move call, the board at x4,y3 does indeed contain the pawn. However, when the program exits the control of that method, the pawn is no longer at that location, and so the 2nd assert equals fails. Why is the board not getting modified properlyp  pEDIT nvm, I foudn the bug, turns out I was not updating the position of the pawn properly, stupid me Pp

Negative 567 pI wasnt sure if this was more of a SuperUser question, but I had seen similar questions here, so I thought Id give this a try.  Apologies if this is misplacedp  pI am using an Excel spreadsheet to track dozens of email inquiries, and currently have two sheets.  I input data in the first sheet and then do a mail merge to send out intro emails in response to the inquiries.  After the mail merge, I move that data to the second sheet for the next step.p  pemWhat Id like to doem is identify duplicate entries as Im entering new data in the first sheet, because sometimes people will send multiple inquiries, and I dont want to send multiple intro emails.  However, attempts to apply conditional formatting to more than one sheet have consistently failed  In fact, if I try, for example, to enter Sheet1CC,Sheet2CC as the range Email is in column C, it just ignores what I wrote and changes it back to whatever the previous selection was.  I also tried naming the ranges, but that didnt seem to work either.p  pIm not a newbie with Excel, but Im not especially experienced either, so I figure theres something simple Im missing but several Google searches with various keywords have all been fruitless.  Any help is greatly appreciatedp

Negative 567 pI have a main form.

Negative 567 pA while ago I created an MVC application before I really understood that MVC is more backend than frontend as in, I wasnt entirely sure where my custom html fit. So I created a website that was just an HTML page, a CSS file and a Javascript file. It worked beautifully so I returned to my MVC application to map what I created onto it so I could serve up information from the backend and not clutter my html with paragraphs of information. I put the JS file in the Scripts folder and included it in my index.cshtml. p  pUpon debugging, I found that it wasnt that the JS was not working, it wasnt included in the project at all. This in both Firefox Developer Edition and Internet Explorer. p  pI tried adding reference to it in reference.js. I tried creating a .DLL and calling it into my page. Ive tried deleting all of the other Javascript files to make sure that it wasnt being overridden, only to end up with a page with no javascript at all. I even tried recreating project and it still did not work. I tried moving my js file to the top in case it had something to do with load order. I tried a couple other things but in the course of three days of searching with little to no progress, I cant remember exactly what they were. The only thing I havent done is put the script itself directly in the page.p  pI am using Windows 10, tried developing in VisualStudio 2015 and rolled back to 2013 due in part to not being able to alter my advanced properties to set the JS content to embedded another suggestion in 2015.

Then getting a Token using codeAcquireTokenByAuthorizationCodecode and saving the Refresh Token in the database. So  when the background Job needs to connect to EWS it can use the Refresh Token saved in the Db using codeAcquireTokenByRefreshTokencode.p  pThis approach works but I dont know how you can get a new Refresh Token when it expires after 14 days. p  pAny idea of how can I renew the refresh token or a better approach for using ADAL in a Background Jobp  pThanks and regardsp

Negative 567 pIn Java to compare two objections for equality, you must implement both the codeequalscode method and the codehashCodecode method. I need to compare two BSTs for equality. How do I implement the codehashCodecode method in such a case Now, implementing the codehashCodecode on the codeNodecode class is simple enough imagine my data is codeintcode. But I cannot just add the values of the node to check if the trees are equal. So how do I do it Has anyone done this successfully p  pI am thinking of many different things that I can do, but I am not sure how scalable they would be. For example I could use level order and for each level multiply by a large prime number, but I cant be sure that this would work. So maybe someone who understands better can help me. Thanks.p

Negative 567 pIm trying to use the boost library to generate random numbers. First I used the boost library to make this very simple classp  precodeinclude ltboostrandommersennetwister.hppgt include ltboostrandomuniform01.hppgt  class TimeRNG01   private     boostrandommt19937 rng     boostrandomuniform01ltdoublegt roll public     TimeRNG01         unsigned int t  staticcastltunsigned intgttime0         rng.seedt           double numreturn rollrng  codepre  pI then made this even simpler class to test it out in an objectp  precodeclass Thingy  private     double x public     Thingydouble xsetxx     void setxint x thisgtx  x      double getxreturn x  codepre  pIn my main method, I was getting some weird results, so I tried a few things to debug it. First, I defined a TimeRNG01 object called trng. Then I wrotep  precodedouble q  trng.num cout ltlt q ltlt endl codepre  pwhich prints a random number between 0 and 1, exactly as expected. But when I next tried to store that q in a Thingy, I got something weirdp  precodeThingy tq cout ltlt t.getx ltlt endl codepre  pThis always prints 0, and not the random number, which is unexpected. To make sure I wasnt doing anything wrong with the Thingy class, I tried thisp  precodedouble f  1 Thingy rf cout ltlt r.getx ltlt endl codepre  pwhich prints 1, exactly as expected.p  pSo for some reason, it seems that the output of this random number generator is not treated as a normal double, and doesnt store  in objects correctly. How can I rectify this so that q is able to be stored as the x value of Thingyp
Negative 567 pThis is going to be pretty vague, so I hope I done get banned for it. p  pIve been learning about various dynamic web tools such as ruby on rails that can require a huge number of referencing between files master view controllers, assets etc. Typically, when designing a rails application, I now draw the whole thing out in inkscape so that I have a visual representation of how all the files are connected to one another. p  pIt would be really useful if I could translate the simple workflow diagram into some skeletal code. For example dragging a red block onto the page would create a controller, dragging an arrow in a direction towards a named view would then create the codedefcode in the controller etc etc. Its just an idea, but I wondered as a result if there were any graphical tools I could manipulate in order to do this kind of taskp  pIf such a tool doesnt exist Im happy to try and code one up myself  any ideas for a starting pointp
Negative 567 pIm just wondering that in the long polling scenario, if a client will receive a new connection ID when the client reconnects after a timeout no response from server p

Negative 567 pI am currently trying to implement exposure compensation for about 16 images using OpenCV 3.0s ExposureCompensator class. I have not resized the source images, and I have provided the topleft corners of each image as best as I can after warping it cylindrically. The masks I have left completely white and at the size of the source images.p  pBut execution stops at the compensatorfeed method, where it just halts and consumes copious amounts of memory. Note that this is an iOS project, but the feed method apparently consumes memory in the range of 10 GBrunning on the simulator. p  pWhat could possibly be going wrong here I have debugged with breakpoints, and with profilers, and it is definitely a problem with the feed method. p  pUpdate I was using the GAINBLOCKS compensator when I encountered the above issue. Using just the GAIN compensator seems to produce much faster results with negligible memory consumption. So I assume that there is an issue with GAINBLOCKS compensation.p

Negative 567 pIs it possible to bind new methods to the global javascript scripting object in runtimep  pRight now, at the start of wpf shell container codeNativeViewInitializedcode event specifically, I am binding a set of method to the scripting object, which I can use it to make wpf calls later on in client side. But is it possible to add more methods to the scripting object outside of NativeViewInitialized considering the window has been running for some time.p  pI tried it do it but it doesnt recognize any of the new method calls.p  pI know I can bind all methods at the start, but I prefer to keep the scripting object small since at the moment I can feel a slightly delay in between page load and I am suspecting that its because of scripting object is so big and most of the overhead is coming from iterating the available methods in there.p  pI know this was possible with the built in wpf web browser but uncertain with Awesomium.  Also, could I unbind a method from scripting object  Thanks.p

Negative 567 pI am writing some code in C. p  pWe have a bunch of concrete classes A, B, C, etc that extend Parent class. Parent class is a Microsoft library so we cant change anything in it.

Negative 567 pSo Im making an app for windows 8 hopefully can be easily ported to windows 10 too in CXAML and am having some issues when it comes to the UI, specifically when it comes to canvases. One of the most prominent features of the app is a large weekly calendar in which I need to place objects. p  pIn the coding of the app I need these things to be able to move around a grid and change heights. In testing I performed this with basic solid rectangles. This was easy enough though they look ugly. I have two designs of which to use instead made in an image editor, shown in this image a hrefhttpimgur.comN5Jv16z relnofollowhttpimgur.comN5Jv16za.p  pIdeally I would be able to use the second in that image, though its proving to be difficult. For the first I just use a border with a translucent background colour and then have a solid rectangle on the left. This would work for the second option as well if borders allowed two children.p  pSo I found the canvas control which I have never used before and tried to get that to work as it seemed the most promising, though I encountered a major issue it has no right alignment option for child controls. Msdn says that it should be there, it is not. I get errors when I type canvas.right5 in xaml as it says this property does not exist. Added to this fact, it seems that the canvas doesnt actually have an edge. I can have that second rectangle way beyond the right edge of the canvas and it still shows up such as this image where canvas.left of the small square was given 250 a hrefhttpimgur.comS46yMhU relnofollowhttpimgur.comS46yMhUa.p  pAs the size of each column in the large grid is done using proportions, the canvas itself will have a variable width so I cant just give the second rectangle a canvas.left property as that only works in discrete pixels. I also need to have these rectangles go the full height of the canvas as using the code behind I only want to have to manipulate the parent object, but having it stretch vertically doesnt work for similar reasons as there not being a bottom to the canvas.p  pIf it matters here is the xaml code Im dealing with extra stuff taken outp  precodeltGrid xNametableGrid HorizontalAlignmentStretch Margin0,50,0,0 Grid.Row1 VerticalAlignmentStretch Grid.Column1gt      ltCanvas Grid.Column3 Height100 Margin1,1,2,2 Grid.Row5 Grid.RowSpan40 VerticalAlignmentTop Background66104A7Cgt         ltRectangle FillFF104A7C HorizontalAlignmentLeft Width5 Height50gt         ltRectangle FillFF104A7C HorizontalAlignmentLeft Width5 Height50 Canvas.Left250 Margin0,0,5,0gt     ltCanvasgt  ltGridgt codepre  pIs there any fixable reason why I do not have a canvas.right property as it seems that it would simplify everything. Setting the alignment of the rectangle in the canvas doesnt do anything. Maybe another control would be better than canvas Ive tried stackpanel with three rectangles middle one being translucent but I cant get it to change widths correctly. Any ideasp

Im trying to transfer some scenario from a WinForms application to a WPF onep  ol liA window has a ListView control with 3 columns.li liThere is a button there to add new rows to that ListView.li liThe first and the second columns contain the ComboBox control.li liThe third column must contain different controls but just one at a time is visible. Which one is visible, it depends on the selected value of the ComboBox at the first column.li liThe content of the ComboBox at the second column changes every time a user selects a value from the ComboBox at the first column.li ol  pThe general scenario is a user selects a type from the list of types from the first ComboBox, after that the second ComboBox changes its content to a list of supported operations for the selected type and the third column at that time must change its content to display a control that supports the input for that type.p  pI know how to implement it using WinForms but I have no idea yet how to do it using WPF.

Negative 567 pI am using Rabbit MQ broker in one of mobile apps that we are developing, I am bit puzzled about security aspects. we are using cloud hosted rabbitmq and hosting platform has given us user name and password which have been changed since and we are using SSLconnection so not so much worried about MIM or eavesdropping.p  pmy concern is anybody who knows host and port can make connection to rabbitmq, since we have mobile app we are storing rabbitmq user name and password on device although encrypted so I guess that anybody who gets physical access to device and somehow decrypts username password can login to rabbitmq, and once you are logged in you can pretty much do anything on rabbitmq like deleting queues etc.. How are MQ like Rabbitmq used in mobile environment. Is there a better  more secure way of using rabbitmq.p

It will generate this outputp  precodeSelectedItem property foo Value property foo codepre  pIn Windows 7, this wont generate any output at all. In Windows 7, the value property or selectedItem property doesnt change when you write your input until you press enter.p  pOn the other hand If I choose an alternative in the combo box popup, the value and selectedItem property behaves identical in Windows 7 and 8.p  pIsnt it a quite serious problem that their behaviour differ so much depending on the platformp  pAnyway. It is a problem for me. I do not want to add a listener to the text property of the combo box editor, because this will result in the listener getting called everytime the user adds one character to the combo box. I just want a listener that reacts when the user has written some input in the combobox and switched focus, or when he has selected an option from the combo box popup. And it needs to be platform independent. I.e I want the windows 8 behaviour of value and selectedItem property in both Windows 7 and 8 and on any other platform.p  pIs this possiblep  pstrongUpdatestrongp  pWhen I wrote this, Java version was 1.8.045 on both platforms. When I updated both to 1.8.060 The value and selectedItem property behaviour became identical on both platforms.p  pHowever. I still want a listener that reacts when the user has written some input in the combobox and switched focus, or when he has selected an option from the combo box popup and switched focus. Should I just add a listener to the focus property that checks the editor text when ever the combo box loses focus, or is there a better wayp

Negative 567 pI am having some trouble with NetBeans and clang, I cannot find the Make Command which the IDE requests upon my trying to run a basic project with a main file containing a print statement. As well, I am receiving an error from the IDE that in cannot include cstdlib even though I have c11 enabled in the idea, as far as I am concerned. Cannot include file  is the error NetBeans provides. Solutions would be appreciated. Also, my default namespace std created by default  when I created the project is not being identified, it also returns an error at this line using namespace std above the main method. p
