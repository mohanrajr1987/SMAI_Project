Im trying to write a Cypher statement that deletes a given node PLUS all nodes that now become unsustained as a result. This may set off a chain reaction, and I dont know how to encode this in Cypher. Is Cypher expressive enoughp  pIn any other language, I could come up with a number of ways to implement this. A recursive algorithm for this would be something likep  precodedeletea      MATCH a [sustainstrue]gt b     REMOVE a     WITH b     MATCH aa [sustainstrue]gt b     WHERE countaa  0     deleteb codepre  pAnother way to describe the additional set of nodes to delete would be with a emfixed pointem functionp  precodesetOfNodesToDeleteSet      RETURN Set  Set such that for all n  Set            there is no m [sustainstrue]gt n with m  Set codepre  pWe would start with the set of all codezcode such that codea [sustainstrue1..]gt zcode, then delete codeacode, run codesetOfNodesToDeletecode on the set until it doesnt change anymore, then delete the nodes specified by the set. This requires an unspecified number of iterations.p  pAny way to accomplish my goal in Cypherp

Positive 34480 pHow can we use neoclient without any framework .Because we are not using codelaravelcode or codesymphonycode even we are  using nothing like these frameworks.Our backend is written pure core PHP. Simply my question is that if we are not using any framework for core purposes then why should we use them to just use a dbms .p  pWhen i calculated the size of vendor folder it was of code102 MBcode. So a single request will use up a large part of ram. Its my guess that while using Neoclient the all files contained in vendor folder will be loaded. so please correct me and if neoclient can be used separately I will be very happy to use that, but please must tell what will be the cons of using NeoClient without dependencies.p

Negative 34480 pI work at a company which uses a legacy content management system based on php utilizing templates.

Negative 34480 pI just had an interview in Redmond where they asked me a ton of security based questions surrounding asp.net.  One of the questions they asked was about configuring a secure intranet application to use constrained delegation to access the SQL Server.  In this scenario an AD user account is delegated access to the SQL Server.  The whole purpose of course is to a not store any usernamepassword anywhere on the web server web.config, and b provide an abstracted security model that can be managed in Active Directory.p  pThis got me to thinking about how I have been configuring my sites for anonymous access all these years.  Typically I will run my IIS websites using the default anonymous account and store the connection string in the web.config encrypted, and sometimes in clear text.  This, of course, requires your SQL Server to run in mixed mode.  So my question is, what if we didnt store the connection string in the web.config at all, and just created a unique anonymous domain account for the particular website that would have dbdatareader access within SQL Server  Is there any reason why it would be a bad idea to do thisp  pI have tried to think of all the scenarios where this would be a bad idea, and the only one I can think of is where a hacker compromised the code on the web server, and then somehow got access to your SQL Server...but this could happen in either scenario.p  pDoes anyone know the best practice herep
Negative 34480 pI am writing a library that I would like to be portable.  Thus, it should not depend on glibc or Microsoft extensions or anything else that is not in the standard.  I have a nice hierarchy of classes derived from stdexception that I use to handle errors in logic and input.  Knowing that a particular type of exception was thrown at a particular file and line number is useful, but knowing how the execution got there would be potentially much more valuable, so I have been looking at ways of acquiring the stack trace.p  pI am aware that this data is available when building against glibc using the functions in execinfo.h see a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions76822howtogenerateastacktracewhenmycappcrashesusinggcccompilerquestion 76822a and through the StackWalk interface in Microsofts C implementation see a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions126450callstackatruntimequestion 126450a, but I would very much like to avoid anything that is not portable.p  pI was thinking of implementing this functionality myself in this formp  precodeclass myException  public stdexception  public   ...   void AddCall stdstring s     mvCallStack.pushback s     stdstring ToStr const        stdstring lsRet       ...     lsRet  Call stackn     for int i  0 i lt mvCallStack.size i        lsRet      mvCallStack[i]  n     ...     return lsRet    private   ...   stdvectorlt stdstring gt mvCallStack   rettype somefunction param1, param2, param3     try        ...      catch myException e         e.AddCall somefunction   param1  ,   param2  ,   param3         throw e      int main int argc, char  argv[]     try        ...      catch  myException e         stdcerr ltlt Caught exception n ltlt e.ToStr     return 1      return 0  codepre  pIs this a terrible idea  It would mean a lot of work adding trycatch blocks to every function, but I can live with that.  It would not work when the cause of the exception is memory corruption or lack of memory, but at that point you are pretty much screwed anyway.  It may provide misleading information if some functions in the stack do not catch exceptions, add themselves to the list, and rethrow, but I can at least provide a guarantee that all of my library functions do so.  Unlike a real stack trace I will not get the line number in calling functions, but at least I would have something.p  pMy primary concern is the possibility that this will cause a slowdown even when no exceptions are actually thrown.  Do all of these trycatch blocks require an additional setup and teardown on each function invocation, or is somehow handled at compiletime  Or are there other issues I have not consideredp

Negative 34480 pI have an admin view which contains four foreign keys each with a few thousand entries. It is slow to appear in the browser. p  pIf I change the django model to eliminate the select boxes by adding rawidfields things become nice and snappy. So the slowness is due to the population of the select drop downs and also this is a known issue since that is why rawidfields exists.p  pId like to understand what is causing the slowness. On the server, if I do a SQL query for the data which are used to populate the select boxes, results are instantaneous. So Postgres retrieving or sorting the data is not the cause.p  pMaybe it is the time it takes to transfer the data populating the drop downs Or is it something that django is doingp

Negative 34480 pSo Im trying out a concept tool of mine where I need to be able to read and write data from a database real easy. Ive set up the form as I like and spread around different text boxes and dropdownboxes to read the data from the database. And Ive got it all to work and all, but theres a small bug I dont fully understand whys there. Some textboxes dont update the text from the database. But it seems as it only occurs if the data in the database is nothing. So the value from the last row is still hanging in the textbox and thus, clicking Update actually updates the value from the field from the last row, into the new row. Messing everything up. p  pNow, what Im the most interested in is the shear flow of the code. Whats the best way of laying out the code to do all this So far Ive got thisp  pemThis is the code when clicking on a cell in the datagridviewemp  precodePrivate Sub DataGridViewCellClickByVal sender As System.Object, ByVal e As System.Windows.Forms.DataGridViewCellEventArgs Handles DataGridView.CellClick      On Error Resume Next         selectedName  Me.DataGridView.CurrentRow.Cells0.Value     selectedGenre  Me.DataGridView.CurrentRow.Cells1.Value     selectedRhytm  Me.DataGridView.CurrentRow.Cells2.Value     selectedLength  Me.DataGridView.CurrentRow.Cells3.Value     selectedFinished  Me.DataGridView.CurrentRow.Cells4.Value     selectedSoundFile  Me.DataGridView.CurrentRow.Cells5.Value      txtBoxName.Text  selectedName     txtBoxGenre.Text  selectedGenre     txtBoxRhytm.Text  selectedRhytm     txtBoxLength.Text  selectedLength     txtBoxFinished.Text  selectedFinished     txtBoxSoundFile.Text  selectedSoundFile  End Sub codepre  pThe selectedvariables are all declared in a GlobalCode.vb Ive got where I create all of them for use later. They are defined like thisp  precodeFriend Module GlobalVariables      Friend selectedName As String  Nothing     Friend selectedGenre As String  Nothing     Friend selectedRhytm As String  Nothing     Friend selectedLength As String  Nothing     Friend selectedFinished As String  Nothing     Friend selectedSoundFile As String  Nothing   End Module codepre  pI havent really done anything like this before. Im more of a designer rather than programmer, but I really need to try out a concept so Im not sure this is the way of doing this at all. Ive found that it works, most of the times. But I reckon skilled programmers have a way of designing the layout of the code so its efficient, clean and easy to read.  So how does this lookp

Negative 34480 pHere is the setupp  blockquote   pWe have a common library that Ive   developed that is used by all   developers on any new applications or   more than trivial changes to old   applications. When we make a change,   we up the minor version number 2.0 to   2.1 if the API is not broken, but if we break the API then we up the major   version number 2.1 to 3.0. There is   an installer package built for every   new version and it is deployed to the   servers and made available to   developers to install when needed. The   installer puts the assemblies in the   GAC on the servers, and modifies the   machine.config to include some   configuration information.p blockquote  pThe most recent version 4.0 uses the System.Configuration namespace pretty heavily custom config sections and config section groups, but theres a problem I didnt think of, and Im not quite sure how to solve when upgrading versions, we have version clashes with the configuration sections.p  pFor example, in the machine.config file it puts in the config section information for specifying the application name. It looks something like thisp  precodeltsection nameapplication typeCommonLibrary.Configuration.ApplicationSection,  CommonLibrary, Version4.0.0.0, Cultureneutral, PublicKeyTokensometokenhere gt codepre  pSo now that we have version 4.1, this section definition breaks because the application is using the version 4.1 dll and the machine config is telling it to load version 4.0 dll.p  pWhat is the best way to deal with this issue You have to keep in mind that the possibility of fixing a critical issue and using publisher policy files to redirect older versions to newer minor versions is there, so a solution would have to account for that unless we decided not to allow for that and only do in place fixes for critical issuesp  pThoughts Opinions Advicep

Please look at the declarations  p  precode    private Combo comboAdress      private ProgressBar pBar codepre  pand the references to objects by getters and setters  p  precode    private final Combo getComboAdress    return this.comboAdress     private final void setComboAdressfinal Combo comboAdress    this.comboAdress  comboAdress     private final ProgressBar getpBar    return this.pBar     private final void setpBarfinal ProgressBar pBar     this.pBar  pBar   codepre  pNow, i wonder why the first declaration dont give me any warning on PMD, while the second gives me the following warning  p  precodeFound nontransient, nonstatic member. Please mark as transient or provide accessors. codepre  pMore details on that warning a hrefhttppmd.sourceforge.netrulesjavabeans.htmlBeanMembersShouldSerialize relnofollow herea.p  phr p  p3. Here is another warning, also given by PMD  p  precode    A method should have only one exit point, and that should be the last statement in the method codepre  pMore details on that warning a hrefhttppmd.sourceforge.netrulescontroversial.htmlOnlyOneReturn relnofollow herea.p  pNow, i agree with that, but what if i write something like this  p  precodepublic void actionPerformedOnModifyComboLocations      if getMainTree.isFocusControl          return          ....do stuffs, based on the initial test  codepre  pI tend to agree with the rule, but if performance of the code suggest multiple exit points, what should i dop  phr p  p4. PMD gives me this p  precodeFound DDanomaly for variable startpage lines 319322. codepre  pwhen i declare something like  p  precodeString startpage  null codepre  pI get rid of this info level of warning is info if i remove the assignment to null, but..i got an error from IDE, saying that the variable could be uninitialized, at some point later in the code. So, i am kind of stuck with that. Supressing the warning is the best you can dop  phr p  p5. PMD Warning  p  precodeAssigning an Object to null is a code smell.  Consider refactoring. codepre  pThis is the case of a singletone use of GUI components or the case of a method who returns complex objects. Assigning the result to null in the catch section its justified by the need to avoid the return of an incompleteinconsistent object. Yes, NullObject should be used, but there are cases where i dont want to do that. Should i supress that warning thenp  phr p  p6. FindBugs warning 1 p  precodeWrite to static field MyClass.instance from instance method MyClass.handleEventEvent codepre  pin the method p  precodeOverride public void handleEventEvent e      switch e.type          case SWT.Dispose              if e.widget  getComposite                  MyClass.instance  null                     break                 codepre  pof the static variable p  precodeprivate static MyClass instance  null codepre  pThe variable allows me to test whether the form is already created and visible or not, and i need to force the recreation of the form, in some cases. I see no other alternative here. Any insights MyClass implements Listener, hence the overrided handleEvent method.p  phr p  p7. FindBugs warning 2p  precodeClass MyClass2 has a circular dependency with other classes codepre  pThis warning is displayed based on simple imports of other classes. Do i need to refactor those imports to make this warning go away Or the problem relies in MyClass2p  pOK, enough said for now..expect an update, based on more findings andor your answers. Thanks.p

Negative 34480 pWhen I developed this app in C Visual Studio 2008 I asked the same question actually managed to find an answer on the MS forum, for which I deserve a prize of some sort. The answer from MS was that the only way to set keyboard shortcuts to your own methods is to write a macro which invokes the method via COM. obviously and set the shortcut to invoke that macro.p  pThis is really not the answer I want to hear.  VSTO makes it possible to build a really nice application with very good use of the ribbon, etc., but then you have to go to the trouble of exposing the entire thing through COM and build another interface into it via the macros.  Which, in addition to being a waste of time, totally circumvents all the security that MS have built into support of VSTO Addins.p  pMy question is Is this really necessary the whole COMmacro thing, or is there a way that I can assign a keyboard shortcut to my own ribbon items  Word 2007  Word 2010p  pThanksp

Negative 34480 pIm looking for advice to speed up serialization performance, specifically when using the Google Android. For a project I am working on, I am trying to relay a couple hundred objects from a server to the Android app, and am going through various stages to get the performance I need.p  pFirst I tried a terrible XML parser that I hacked together using Scanner specifically for this project, and that caused unbelievably slow performance when loading the objects 5 minutes for a 300KB file. I then moved away from that and made my classes implement Serializable and wrote the ArrayList of objects I had to a file. Reading that file into the objects the Android, with the file already downloaded mind you, was taking 1530 seconds for the 100KB serialized file. I still find this completely unacceptable for an Android app, as my app requires loading the data when starting the application. p  pI have read briefly about Externalizable and how it can increase performance, but I am not sure as to how one implements it with nested classes. Right now, I am trying to store an ArrayList of the following class, with the nested classes below it.p  precodepublic class MealMenu implements Serializable private String commonsName private long startMillis, endMillis, modMillis private ArrayListltVenuegt venues private String mealName  codepre  pAnd the Venue classp  precodepublic class Venue implements Serializable private String name private ArrayListltFoodItemgt foodItems  codepre  pAnd the  FoodItem classp  precodepublic class FoodItem implements Serializable private String name private boolean vegan private boolean vegetarian  codepre  pIF Externalizable is the way to go to increase performance, is there any information as to how java calls the methods in the objects when you try to write it out I am not sure if I need to implement it in the parent class, nor how I would go about serializing the nested objects within each object.p

Negative 34480 pIm writing stored procs that are being called by a legacy system. One of the constraints of the legacy system is that there must be at least one row in the single result set returned from the stored proc. The standard is to return a zero in the first column yes, I know.p  pThe obvious way to achieve this is create a temp table, put the results into it, test for any rows in the temp table and either return the results from the temp table or the single empty result.p  pAnother way might be to do an EXISTS against the same where clause thats in the main query before the main query is executed.p  pNeither of these are very satisfying.

Negative 34480 pI have a sitecore page with an ASP dropdownlist, and the data on the form is populated from the selected value of the dropdown.

In the postback, the new selected item is added to the querystring and the user is redirected for linkability.p  pI recently enabled HTML caching for all sublayouts, Vary by querystring, and now suddenly, this mechanism no longer works. What seems to happen is I select a new dropdown item, the page appears to post back though if Im debugging, none of my breakpoints get hit. After that, if I change the selected item again, I can see in Firebug the message doPostBack is not defined, which appears to mean the ASPgenerated JavaScript is not being added to the page.p

One of the most shortterm feature I would like to borrow from Flex is their animated drag and drop and animated automatic reordering of components cell phone examples, hide one, the 2 others move sidebyside, or when you drag elements in a window it moves the others around in a fluid and logical fashion, versus ZK that looks nice but statically moves boxes or information around httpwww.zkoss.orgzkdemolayoutbusinessportal and httpwww.zkoss.orgzkdemoeffectsdragndropp  pI guess there could be extra programming done by my developers to add the animation feature, but if something out there does this and much more in a simplified way, it would be awesome.p

Negative 34480 pI am still fairly new to Ccli and am not always sure when I am writing something whether I am doing something that creates a transition between managed and unmanaged run times. For instance I cannot add a LARGEINTEGER or a stdvector as a member of a managed class, but I can use either in the middle of a managed method, but I dont know whether doing so creates a transition between managed and unmanaged runtimes. How can I see every point at which I am forcing a transition to be made and how can I measure the cost of those transitionsp  pOne possibility that occurs to me is that I expect there is a transition to unmanaged and a transition to managed block of code in windows. Are there symbols for those I can put breakpoints at, e.g. with windbg so I can see each transition Is there a way to get visual studio to show you each transition at runtimep  pTo measure the inpact when there are many transitions, are there corresponding event tracing for windows events that I can see with xperf, or performance counters for them I can see with perfmonp
Negative 34480 pIm trying to find the source of a memory leak in a Compact Framework application using the Remote Performance Monitor. I managed to remove a few minor ones related to brushes and other graphic objects, but I still dont have a clear idea of what is causing the main problem.p  pAt this point the only objects that seem to never go back to their original count are System.String objects. I find this to be very weird, since I wouldve thought that in order for these objects to remain uncollected, the objects that contain them would have to remain as well, and yet no other type of objects seem to be increasing along with the System.Strings.p  pIm trying to find out which new String objects are the ones that remain after the application returns to its original state i.e. the login screen. The problem is that originally, the application loads with about 2200 string objects, and then after process X it increases another 70 or so which never get collected. I dont know how to identify those 70 new objects, in order to find out who is holding on to them and make the appropriate corrections.p  pDoes anyone have any experience in which Strings were not being collected Is there any way to separate the new objects created during process X from those that were originally required by the application so that I can know which are leaking Any advice would be appreciated.p  pThanks p  pUPDATEp  pOk... there is something very strange going on. Im starting to doubt whether there is a leak at all. p  pLets say that I take a memory snapshot at the Login screen which is the original starting point of the application. Imagine that there are 1000 string objects in memory at this point. Now, if I login and choose an option from the menu, Ill take a snapshot once the new screen is loaded. Lets say that loading this form increases the string count by say 50 objects. When I logout and take a snapshot again at the login screen, only 25 of those objects have been collected, the rest will stay in memory from then on.p  pThe strange thing is that if I keep repeating this process, no further string objects will accumulate. Instead of the string count increasing by 50, only 25 will be added at this point, and those same 25 will be collected once I go back to the login screen. Im thinking that if this were an actual leak, then each time that I opened that screen the string count would increase permanently by 25, but this only happens the first time. p  pThis happens to me on every new screen that I open. At first there is a small permanent increase in the overall string count, but once Ive loaded that particular screen, any increase in the string count during its execution will be collected once I go back to the login screen.p  pAll of this has led me to believe that perhaps those strings are part of the inner workings of the CLR or something like that. Could it be some sort of caching done by the runtime Perhaps it is storing my string constants for faster loading Something like that I hope this wasnt too confusing.p

Unfortunately, non of the errors in the trace files indicated that this was the problem. I went through many hours of trial and error before I figured out what went wrong.li liSome of the provided activities are insufficient. For example, I had to extend the Send activity to support dynamic endpoints. Unfortunately, I wasnt able to make it completely dynamic, for example, the interface name cannot be dynamic.li liIf a workflow gets too big, the designer becomes very slow. One workflow thats over 100KB in size took more than a minute to load And forget about debugging a workflow of this size.li liNo persistence provider for Oracle.li ul  pDespite the pitfalls, Im very impressed with the persistence capabilities to the database, the ease of snapping activities together in the designer, and the ease of setting up WCF services as workflow services.p  pIm curious about the experiences of the other developers using Workflow Foundation 4.p  pstrongEditstrongp  pI was able to solve the problem of the extremely slow designer for large workflows.

Negative 34480 pIm trying to run the map reduce implementation of quadratic sieve algorithm on Hadoop. For this purpose Im using karmasphere Hadoop community plugin with Netbeans. The program works fine using the plugin. But Im unable to run it on actual cluster.

And input and output files are created with no content.p  pBut this works fine when running using Karmasphere plugin.p

Negative 34480 pI am running some JUnit tests on a single thread and they are failing in a nondeterministic way.  I had one person tell me that the optimizing JVM Oracle Hotspot 64Bit 17.1b03 is executing the instructions out of order for speed.  I have trouble believing that the java spec would allow that, but I cant find the specific reference.p  pWikipedia states that a single thread must enforce withinthread asifserial so I shouldnt have to worry about execution order differing from what I wrote. a hrefhttpen.wikipedia.orgwikiJavaMemoryModelThememorymodel relnofollowhttpen.wikipedia.orgwikiJavaMemoryModelThememorymodelap  pExample codep  precodeTest public void testPersistence throws Exception       Setup     final long preTestTimeStamp  System.currentTimeMillis       Test     persistenceMethod       Validate     final long postTestTimeStamp  System.currentTimeMillis     final long updateTimeStamp   load the timestamp from the database       assertTrueUpdated time should be after the pretest time, updateTimeStamp gt preTestTimeStamp     assertTrueUpdated time should be before the posttest time, updateTimeStamp lt postTestTimeStamp   void persistenceMethod      ...     final long updateTime  System.currentTimeMillis     ...      persist updateTime to the database      ...  codepre  pWhen this test code is run it has completely nondeterministic behavior, sometimes it passes, sometimes if fails on the first assert, and sometimes it fails on the second assert.  The values are always within a millisecond or two of each other so it isnt that the persistence is just failing completely.  Adding a Thread.sleep2 between each statement does decrease the number of times the test fails, but doesnt eliminate the failures completely.p  pIs it possible that this is the fault of the JVM or is it more likely that the database MsSql is doing some sort of rounding of the stored datap

Negative 34480 pWe are testing JDBC drivers from jTDS and Microsoft, and we are suffering from unwanted pauses in query execution. Our application opens many ResultSets and fetches only a few rows from each. Each query selects about 100k rows, but we fetch only about 50 which is enough to fill a page. The problem is that every query after the first contains a pause of about 2s, on which the driver loads all rows from the previous ResultSet to a temporary storage memory or disk, so they can be traversed later. Because we have about 6 queries in worst scenarios, there will be a pause of about 10s, which makes the application unresponsive to the user. MSSQL version is 2005.p  pTo remove such pauses, weve tried to enable MARS Multiple Active Result Sets via connection string parameters of Microsoft JDBC driver due to lack of documentation, we tried everything that is listed on a hrefhttpssites.google.comsitesqlconnectsql2005strings relnofollowhttpssites.google.comsitesqlconnectsql2005stringsa. Example of connection stringp  pjdbcsqlserverTESTDBMACHINEinstanceNameS2005databaseNameSampleDBMarsConnyesp  pBut none of them solves the problem. Microsoft JDBC driver seems to accept anything at connection string  if you replace MarsConnyes by PleaseBeFastyes, MS driver ignores the parameter and doesnt even log the fact. I dont know if MARS is a clientonly feature that just caches rows from a previously active result set, or if its a server feature. I dont even know how to detect, from the server side, if a given connection is using MARS. If you can comment on this, it will be welcome.p  pAnother solution for the pause was to use scrollable bidirectional result sets. This removes the pause, but makes fetch time 80 slower and more network consuming. We are now considering to implement a JDBC connection wrapper that keeps a pool of actual connections and automatically issue queries to distinct ResultSet free connections. But this is somewhat cumbersome because we need to keep a link between each connection and its active ResultSet. Also it would consume more connections from the server and may cause troubles to DBAs. And this solution doesnt help if there is an active transaction, on which all queries must be issued on the same connection.p  pDo you know some parameter, configuration, specific API, link or trick that can remove the pause from the second and subsequent query executionsp
Negative 34480 pOur team are looking into implementing Code Analysis as a check in policy in TFS. p  pWeve decided on which rules we want to enforce but wont be applying the policies to TFS for a while as we are currently migrating to TFS 2010.p  pIn the meantime to get used to it and start removing Code Analysis warnings the dev team are going to start manually enabling Code Analysis.p  pSo, is there a way we can publish or automatically enforce a set of rules without having to manually edit the properties for every project in every solutionp

Negative 34480 pIve seen similar questions e.g. a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions989349runningacommandinanewmacosxterminalwindowRunning a command in a new Mac OS X Terminal windowa  but I need to confirm this command and its expected behavior in a mac which I dont have.  If anyone can run the following in Python 3 Macp  precodeimport subprocess, os def runcombashCommand      sp  subprocess.Popen[osascript], stdinsubprocess.PIPE, stderrsubprocess.PIPE      sp.communicatetell application Terminalnactivatendo script with command 0 EXITnend tell.formatbashCommand  runcomecho This is a testnnThis should come two lines later press any keyread throwaway runcomecho This is a testnnecho This should come one line later press any keyread throwaway runcomecho This is testing whether I can have you enter your sudo pw on separate terminalsudo lsnecho You should see your current directory press any keyread throwaway codepre  pFirstly, and most basically, is the spawn new terminal and execute command correct For reference, this version of the coderuncomcode function came from a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions7536623osxpython3behaviorwhileexecutingbashcommandinnewterminal75366517536651this answer belowa, and is much cleaner than my original.p  pAs for the actual tests the first one tests that internal double escaped codencode characters really work.  The second tests that we can put unescaped newlines into the script and still have it work just like semicolon.  Finally, the last one tests whether you can call a sudo process in a separate terminal my ultimate goal.p  pIn all cases, the new terminal should disappear as soon as you press any key.  Please also confirm this.p  pIf one of these doesnt work, a correctiondiagnosis would be most appreciated.  Also appreciated is there a more pythonic way of spawning a terminal on Mac then executing a sudo, extended bash commands on itp  pThanksp

Negative 34480 pTheres an awful lot on the web these days about how important it is to minify your JavaScript. Speed is all that matters.p  pBut doesnt minification work against the openness of Open Sourcep  pOne of the great things about JS as opposed to flash and the backend is that the source code is right there, available to be viewed by other developers who come along and think Hey, that looks good, I wonder how they did that. The JS source code is available for everyone to see, and so developers can learn from it, adapt it, and use similar JS on their own projects.p  pMinifying JS makes it unreadable. It stops the external developer from being able to read the code, and so cancels out horizontal sharing and learning.p  pObviously there will be some who wish to minify their JS for the express purpose of attempting to hold on to their intellectual property. Its always a shame when people undermine the creativity of the opensource community, but its somewhat understandable, and certainly not going to stop.p  pBut for the rest of us developers  the people who use opensource every day of our lives  JS minification gets in our way. It makes us unable to take advantage of the openness of the web. It closes down the possibility of creative sharing.p  pIm all about some things being minified  libraries, plugins, etc and maybe when serving JS to mobile. But for the custombuilt code that makes your individual website individual, minifying your code is really not that necessary. It may save a few ms of download time, but keeping it open wont change that much. Most of the sites on the web probably have less than 20KB of custom JS code, and the benefit of minifying that really is minimal. Do a few ms really compare with the benefit of keeping JS code open, readable and available for othersp  pFor sites with more JS, maybe we could start to develop an opensourcebased standard, so that developers can type in a slightly different URL in order to be served the unminified code. If the minified code is at domain.comscript.min.js, lets make the unminified always available at domain.comscript.js or script.full.js. Or are there other suggestionsp  pI cant really find anything else on the web talking about this issue. Everything is on the other side  pushing minification. And that alarms me. It makes me think that, as developers, weve allowed ourselves to sink into an unquestioned ideology of speed, regardless of other factors. And probably, because of the nature of ideology, some of you reading this will immediately want to dismiss it and argue against it. But think just a little bit longer   is the tiny speed benefit really worth the loss of opensource creativity I dont believe it is.p  pSo I guess my question is, wheres the debate about opensource JavaScriptingp

As soon as it has found a difference between a result for each of the distinct athletes it orders them accordingly.p  pFor example, if I have 2 athletesp  precodeTime for Athlete 1  00105 Time for Athlete 2  00103 codepre  pThis will yield the order, Athlete 2, Athlete1p  pHowever, if i havep  precodeTime for Athlete 1  00105 Time for Athlete 2  00103 Time for Athlete 2  01115 codepre  pThen the order is given as Athlete 1, Athlete 2 as the first difference is in the mins digit and Athlete 2 is slower...p  pCan anyone suggest a way to get around this problem and essentially go down the entries in codefilterednamescode pulling out each name the first time it appears i.e. keeping the names in the order they first appear in codefilterednamescodep  pThanks for your time p

Negative 34480 pI am writing a little test app which connects to a SQL Server database which has 2 tables in it. Table 1 is a list of data with a non unique key which points to multiple rows in table 2. At the moment what I do is traverse each record in Table 1 and then get the relevant records from Table 2 with a separate query. Table 2 has over 26 million records in it and this process takes a very long time. The data in Table 1 could have just a few hundred records in it or anything up to about 1 million.p  pIs there a way of speeding up this data access Perhaps using a table join to get all the data in one query Or anything elsep  pSorry I cannot post the database tables or current code as I am under NDA as it is very sensitive data.

Negative 34480 pI have web service client that connects to a MS Exchange server. The initial connection time is very long for this system, around 30 sec. So i would like to open this initial connection as soon as I start my application server and then let stateless ejbs use this connection without having to reconnect to the MS Exchange server.

Negative 34480 pIn my MVC3 application, I have a queries class specific to each controller that performs conversions between domain entities and converts them to view models.  I do this to keep my controllers clean and its easier to unit test the controllers and queries seperately.  p  pThere are cases, though, when the query method needs to pass strongnonexceptional error messagesstrong to the view e.g. the entity was not found.  However, since my controller is only receiving a ViewModel from the query method and not any type of return code, the only two options that I have found to pass this error are as followsp  ol lipThrow an Exception from the query method and use a TryCatch block to catch the exception in the controller.  pli lipAdd a property to the View Model called ErrorMessage which is populated by the query method that the view uses to perform logic of what needs displayed.pli ol  pBecause these arent exceptional cases, and I know I shouldnt use TryCatch to control program flow, I have choosen to use the second method. Though this works for now, it feels dirty to me for the following reasonsp  ul liThe controller has to receive a whole View Model when an error occurs just to get the ErrorMessage property.li liThe view has to have hardcoded logic and two sections to display either the error or the normal contentli liThough I could put the codeif Model.ErrorMessage  nullcode logic in my controller to determine which view to pass, its still not feeling like a clean solution.li ul  pAre there any design patterns that I could use that could help me refactor this code and make it cleanerp  pstrongExample View Modelstrongp  precodepublic class ApplicationViewModel    public string ErrorMessage  get set    public int Id  get set    public string Name  get set     Other properties here...  codepre  pstrongExample Controller Methodstrongp  precodepublic ActionResult RetrieveGuid guid    return ViewApplication, applicationQueries.GetApplicationViewModelguid  codepre  pstrongExample ApplicationQueries Methodstrongp  precodepublic ApplicationViewModel GetApplicationViewModelGuid guid    var applicationViewModel  new applicationViewModel    if applicationServices.Existsguid        applicationViewModel.ErrorMessage  The requested application does not exist.     return applicationViewModel        More code here that checks things which might set the ErrorMessage property...    var application  applicationServices.GetApplicationByGuidGuidguid   Mapper.MapgrantApplication, grantApplicationViewModel   return grantApplicationViewModel  codepre  pstrongSnippit from Application.cshtml View for Error Handlingstrongp  precodemodel MyApp.Web.Areas.Application.Models.ApplicationViewModel if Model.ErrorMessage  null    ltdivgtModel.ErrorMessageltdivgt  else    lt Display normal content here gt  codepre

Negative 34480 pSo, I have a Mapper that updates an HBase table.  In the map function, I p  p1 instantiate an HBaseConfigurationp  p2 instantiate an HTablep  p3 call hTable.put a bunch of times to add rowsp  p4 call hTable.flushCommits to flush my changesp  p5 call HConnectionManager.deleteConnection to kill the connection to HBasep  pHowever, this seems inefficient.  I would like to instantiate the HBaseConfiguration and the HTable in the constructor for my Mapper class.  Then I could have my mapper class implement Closeable, calling hTable.flushCommits and HConnectionManager.deleteConnection in the close method.  That way, in each call to map, Id be buffering my put calls, and would be flushing all the changes at once, when close is called.p  pHowever, this is only worthwhile if the Mapper object is reused for multiple calls to map.  Otherwise, I may as well leave my code alone.p  pSo the main question is  are Mapper objects used for more than one call to mapp  pThe bonus question is  would the rewritten code be more efficientp

J 1988. Succinct static data structuresem, which does not seem appropriate for my task. I deal with huge binary trees given in depthfirst layout and the depthfirst node indices are keys to other node properties, so changing the tree layout has some cost for me which Id like to minimize. Hence the interest in getting references to works considering other then BF tree layouts.pli lipLarge variablelength items arrays in external memory.

Negative 34480 pI grew up knowing that codefinalcode is a keyword that when applied to variables does not make it possible to reassign the variable to something else. If a variable is final then its a constant summarize many and while Im not a fan of that definition its probably a good way to keep the concept in mind. I just prefer to say that codeyou cannot change the value of the variablecode whatever the value means.p  pMy life was happy but one day I took a deeper look at codemethod local inner classescode...p  pAn inner class defined inside a method cannot access variables defined in the method itself. Why Because while the class lives in the Heap and it might keep existing after the method completes a valid reference of the class might be passed and stored somewhere else, those variables live in the stack and they die when the method returns. We dont want to have an inner class trying to access a variable that does not exist anymore at a later time because then the world will end. p  pPerfect. It makes sense. Excellent And then unless you declare those variables final..... Then your class can access them and the compiler doesnt send you to hell... p  pcodeWHYcode I mean, what kind of sorcery is this What does final exactly do and why I had to wait to talk about method local inner classes to figure this out Assuming the final variables are stored in the Heap no matter where they are defined, are there any other applications besides the concept of making method local inner classes happyp

Negative 34480 pMy current situation is I have a custom workflow which include many statuses.p  pFor each Jira issue, has some subtasks.p  pI want a validation mechanism, which can prevent the Issue going to the next statuses untill some certain custom fields have been validated.

Negative 34480 pIve started writing a tool for modelling graphs nodes and edges, both represented by objects, not adjacency matrices or simply numbers recently to get some practice in software development next to grad school. Id like a node to know its neighbors and the edges its incident with. An obvious way to do this would be to take a HashSet and a HashSet. What I would like to do however is have a methodp  precodeNodeA.getEdgeNode B codepre  pthat returns the edge between nodes A and B in O1. I was thinking of doing this by replacing the two HashSets mentioned above by using one HashMap that maps the neighbors to the edges that connect a node with its neighbors. For example, callingp  precodeNodeA.hashmap.getB codepre  pshould return the edge that connects A and B. My issue here is whether theres a way to havep  precodeHashMap.keySet.containsNode A HashMap.values.containsEdge e codepre  pboth work in O1 If that isnt the case with the standard libraries, are there implementations that will give me constant time for add, remove, contains, size for keySet and valuesp

Negative 34480 pI have a problem with my Jquery code. Im trying to make a gallery. I want that when a person clicks on a image, to attach that image to a div and display it in the center of the screen. My problem is with images that are larger than the current screen size. I resize the image to match the screen size, but when I fade it in into the div it lags. I cant figure out why is that, and Im sure its not just because the image is big, if I dont resize it and let is go off the screen it fades in just fine.

Any help or guidance I would be grateful, as im not quite sure how to do this with regards the language or communication needed between the site and machine. Now I know its a security risk, and you might ask why but its simply for a college project so it will only be running on my own machine that is also running the website on apache, from my machine aswell its more just to show that it can be done.  p

Negative 34480 pI am integrating breezeJS into an existing requireJS project which already uses knockoutJS. I ran into a couple of problems.  p  pThe first was that breeze is unable to load the Q library unless i include it on my html wrapper as a codeltscriptgtcode tag, not as a loaded AMD dependency.  In my project i am trying to keep my code down to a single script tag, so this isnt ideal.p  pThe second issue is that breezeJS is unable to load knockout. In my main.js I have defined a path for knockout to bep  pcodeknockout ..libsknockoutknockout2.2.0,codep  pI do this because I like knowing for sure that I am not accessing a global codekocodep  pHowever when i added breeze to my project, breeze wasnt able to load my knockout library.  Looking into the breeze code i can see that it has been hardcoded to load the knockout library as codekocode.p  pNot wanting to change all of my code i found that i could add my AMD loaded knockout library to the global window object as codewindow[ko]code.  But this feels like quite a bodge.  Also weirdly adding Q this way and removing the codeltscriptgtcode tag didnt work, as i think Q is required too early in the applications lifecycle, even before i get to pollute the global  i did nest my coderequirecode calls in main.js but that hid the majority of my application files from the build process so i abandoned that approach.p  pHow can i include Q and knockout and breeze in my project and still use a single line codeltscriptgtcode tag, at the moment I am having to include Q as a separate codeltscriptgtcode tag and pollute the global to get breeze and knockout to play nicely.  p  pI am using quite a few other libraries in my project and none of them have been this difficult to integrate in.p  pAny help is much appreciatedp  pCheersp  pGavp  pEDIT Here is my full require configp  precoderequire.config           shims are for 3rd party libraries that have not been written in AMD format.      shims define AMD modules definitions that get created at runtime.          shim          jqueryUI  deps [jquery] ,         jqueryAnimateEnhanced  deps [jqueryUI] ,         jqueryScrollTo  deps [jquery] ,         touchPunch  deps [jquery] ,         Q  exports Q ,         breeze  deps [Q, knockout], exports breeze ,         path  exports Path ,         signalR  deps [jquery] ,     ,      paths          jquery         jquery ..libsjqueryjquery1.7.2.min,         jquery.adapter ..libsjqueryjquery.adapter,          jquery plugins         horizontalNav ..libsjquerypluginshorizontalNavjquery.horizontalNav,         jqueryUI ..libsjquerypluginsjqueryuijqueryui1.9.2.custom,         jqueryAnimateEnhanced ..libsjquerypluginsanimateenhancedjquery.animateenhanced,         touchPunch ..libsjquerypluginstouchpunchjquery.ui.touchpunch.min,         jqueryScrollTo ..libsjquerypluginsjqueryscrollTojquery.scrollTo.min,         reveal ..libsjquerypluginsrevealjquery.reveal,         opentip ..libsjquerypluginsopentipopentipjquery,          RequireJS         domReady ..libsrequirepluginsdomReady,         text ..libsrequirepluginstext,         async ..libsrequirepluginsasync,         depend ..libsrequirepluginsdepend,         json ..libsrequirepluginsjson,         noext ..libsrequirepluginsnoext,          coffeescript         coffeescript ..libscoffeecoffeescript,         cs ..libsrequirepluginscs,          Path         path ..libspathpath.min,          Knockout         knockout ..libsknockoutknockout2.2.0,         knockoutTemplateSource ..libsknockoutko.templateSource,         knockoutValidation ..libsknockoutko.validation,          breeze         Q ..libsbreezeq,         breeze ..libsbreezebreeze.debug,          Signals Observer pattern         signals ..libssignalssignals,          SignalR  Push notifications         signalR ..libssignalRjquery.signalR0.5.2.min,          utils         logger commonlogginglogger,         tinycolor ..libstinycolortinycolor,         composing commoncompositioncomposing,          app specific         BaseWidgetViewModel appviewcoreBaseWidgetViewModel,        codepre

Negative 34480 pI had everything working fine with automatic migrations set up and working.  I had just made a number of foreign key changes in my domain classes and when I started my app I got an illegal column CreatedOn exception.  Browsing I found that this error is typically due to moving from ef 4 to ef 5 and back.  Ive always just used ef 5.  I couldnt find any reason for the error so I decided to go back to basics.  I turned off migrations and set my initializer to DropAndCraeteAlways.  It dropped the db but didnt create a new one.  So I moved further back to basics and removed migrations altogether and set the initilizer to CreateIfNoneExists.  Still no db creation.  Im at a loss as to what else to try or how to debug.  The only exception Im getting is when I try to initialize the db I get a db not found which is obvious.  Any help will be greatly appreciated.p

Negative 34480 pI have a very simple problem I cant wrap my head around in regards to SQLite. I am trying to learn more about SQL by a hrefhttpsql.learncodethehardway.com relnofollowreading through a booka and following the examples. One of the exercises is to write a query that can find which pet out of a pet table is the parent of another pet. Both the pet.id and pet.parent columns use INTEGER data types. So for one pet the id would be 2 and another pet would be 3... The pet schema has pet id, name, breed, parent type of structure. So for example codeINSERT INTO pet VALUES2, scraps, lolcat, 3code would make this pet.id2,pets.namescraps,pet.breedlolcat, pet.parent3. In this table some of the pets will also be parents of other pets. So their pet.id would also match the parent.id of some other pet...It seems kinda complexp  pI wrote a query that I thought makes since but it does not return any results or throw any errors. That query is         codeSELECT pet.name, pet.breed FROM pet WHERE     pet.parent  pet.idcodep
Negative 34480 pI am handling a project constructed under opencart framework.p  pIn the content management system, I can see normal content input in a textarea being displayed normally at frontend webpage.

Negative 34480 pConsider a class codeRectanglecode that defines a region by the cornersp  precodepublic class Rectangle      public int X1  get set      public int Y1  get set      public int X2  get set      public int Y2  get set   codepre  pIt can be said that two codeRectanglecode objects codeOverlapcode if they have any regions in common.  Heres a simple method that implements the codeOverlapcode logicp  precodepublic bool OverlapsRectangle other      return this.X1 lt other.X2 ampamp this.X2 gt other.X1 ampamp         this.Y1 lt other.Y2 ampamp this.Y2 gt other.Y1  codepre  pNow I want to partition a set of codeRectanglecode objects into groups of overlapping rectangles.  The catch is that some rectangles in the group may not necessarily overlap other rectangles in the same group, as long as they share other overlapping rectangles.  The result is always welldefined, but there is no direct mapping from the rectangles to the final overlapping groups.p  pIt seems intuitively that it should be possible to use codeGroupBycode to build groups of overlapping rectangles.  However, there is no key that defines whether rectangles belong to the same group what matters is if they overlap.  Can this problem be solved using codeGroupBycode, even if it means grouping recursively until all the proper groups are combinedp

Negative 34480 pI have an interesting conundrum. I have been challenged with identifying the most suitable process in which to create a browser frontend to an existing multiuser application built within the TigerLogicPick D3 environment.

Negative 34480 pemPleaseem could someone help me with this, Im past the stage of pulling my hair out and dont want to end up baldp  pHaving searched SO, read about and tinkered with inline  inlineblock, float, lineheight amp fontsize properties for  several days, I have an issue which I still simply cannot understand  aligning the baselines of two text elements.p  pIm creating a simpleish button with an image and two text elements heading and label. I would like the text elements separated in adjacent SPANS with heading and label in different FONTSIZES aiming for label to be rightaligned.p  pI just want the text in the adjacent spans to be vertically centred within the line height but sit on a common baseline. The trouble is even when I get close using the methods mentioned below, I am still seeing differing results on various browsers Opera in particular. I am reluctant to get into browserspecific CSS adjustments because the results seem to vary slightly in almost every browser.p  pEverything else seems to be fine, so Ive stripped out the unnecessary elements of code along with various failed efforts at getting the baselines aligned, such as lineheight, verticalalign, padding, margin etc etc. So I realise what I have isnt going to work as is. I also exaggerated the difference in fontsize to show the problem more clearly.p  pI apologise if this question is as old as time itself, but nothing I have found here on SO seems to solve my problem.p  pstrongCSSstrongp  precode.snborder  position relative display block width 237px height 25px borderbottom 1px solid 54534A overflow hidden  .snborder span  display block  overflow hidden  .snlabel  width 100 lineheight 25px  .sntitle, .sntag  float left  .sntitle  width 165px fontsize 14px color 54534A  .sntag  width 72px fontsize 8px textalign right color 8C8C8C  codepre  pstrongMarkupstrongp  precodelta href classsnbordergt ltspan classsnlabelgt ltspan classsntitlegtExample Heading 001ltspangt ltspan classsntaggtExample Labelltspangt ltspangt ltagt codepre  pstrongJSFiddlestrong a hrefhttpjsfiddle.netsRLyM relnofollowhttpjsfiddle.netsRLyMap  pIm sure this must be simple but I have tried EVERYTHING i can think of, read every link i can find relating to the subject  all to no avail.

Negative 34480 pI have the following problem. I have a UITableview that is powered by an NSFetchedResultsController. It should display lets say a projects, folders and files.

Negative 34480 pIm working on getting my website to work on different mobile devices and Ive come across a couple problems with devicewidth. I know questions like this have been asked before but Ive read conflicting things both here and elsewhere and havent found anything that clarifies what Im looking for. p  pAssume Im using a Nexus One which has a resolution of 480x800. Now if make a meta tag likep  precodeltmeta nameviewport contentwidthdevicewidthgt codepre  pIf it is in portrait the viewport width is 320px and if it is in landscape the viewport width is 533px. This makes sense as the logical resolution is 320x533. But when I make a media query likep  precodemedia only screen and maxdevicewidth 320px      CSS rules here   codepre  pThe devicewidth refers to physical resolution and doesnt change based on orientation. So for the Nexus One the devicewidth is 480px regardless of orientation and therefore isnt included in the media query.p  pIs this normal behavior If it is, why does devicewidth behave so differently between the two Theyre using not only different values but one of them changes based on orientation and the other doesnt. This is very confusing and to make things worse Ive read the exact opposite that media query devicewidth is affected by orientation and meta tag devicewidth is not  other places on the web.p  pAny help clarifying would be greatly appreciated.p

Negative 34480 pI want my app to synchronise with the Reminders.app. my app utilizes Core Datap  pIve already done a prototype and it works, but there are some bugs I cant think through.p  pRight now my sync algorithm looks like thisp  p1.Listen to codeEKEventStoreChangedNotificationcode notification and when called syncp  p2.First Im iterating over my local Calendars, and if they dont exist in Reminders.app Im adding them.p  pThis is a pretty bad design because if I delete a calendar in Reminders.app and if its added to my app, it gets added again to Reminders.app. Its going to be much better to know if a calendar has been deleted.p  p3.Then I iterate over each Calendar from Reminders.app, and if this calendar doesnt exist in my local records I add them to my local.app. If it does exist, then Im updating its title.p  p4.Im fetching all the reminders from my codeEKEventStorecodep  p5.Im iterating through all my local reminders, and if they dont exist in Reminders.app Im adding them.p  pAgain the problem with deleting  same story as calendar deleting.p  p6.Im iterating through all Reminders.app reminders and if they dont exist in my app Im adding them in my local.app. If they do exist Im updating all values.p  pIts all fine, until I hit this problem with deleting.

Negative 34480 pI am using a hrefhttpfancyapps.comfancybox relnofollowfancyBoxa to display menusdialogues to users of an app I am building. The content displayed in the box is HTML  I could generate it all in JS and put it into a hidden div to display when needed, or make an AJAX call to fetch the content when a fancyBox is opened.p  pIs there any downside to having a bunch of hidden divs in a page performance issues on mobile browsers etc Id prefer to do it this way as the user experience is obviously going to be snappier.p

Negative 34480 pTo learn C native interop, Ive been working on an OpenGL wrapper.  The OpenGL API itself is a state machine which is bound to a specific thread.  When an object containing native resources is garbage collected, the finalizer is running in the GC thread, and cannot directly free the resources.p  pThe workaround I currently have is to have a list in the context object, which the objects add their resources to and at a safe point in the draw loop it iterates through and frees them.p  pThe problem with this, however, is that if the GC collects while its iterating through that list, the foreach fails as the collection has been modified.  I cant just put a mutex around the list as the GC is stoptheworld in most implementations and if the draw loop had locked it, itd never complete the iteration and unlock it again.p  pTypically the MTBF is about two hours of gameplay, but if intentionally stress tested with a few thousand objects per second it happens in just a few seconds.p  pWhat might be the best approach herep

Negative 34480 pIm having trouble finding reliable documentation on what happens when you call the default constructor on an XMVECTOR.p  pMSDN says that the XMMATRIX default constructor does not initialize the variables to 0 a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibrarywindowsdesktopee420023vvs.85.aspx relnofollowhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibrarywindowsdesktopee420023vvs.85.aspxa.

Negative 34480 pSorry for the badly worded title, its hard to summarise this.p  pIve got a fixed header at the top of my website, and then Ive got some videos that are iFramed in from Vine and YouTube mostly. My problem is that even though the header is fixed, with a higher zindex, and its APPEARING higher than the video iFrames, its not behaving that way. This seems to be due to the iOS Video frame, or whatever you want to call it.p  pIve put this mock together to show you what I mean a hrefhttpsdl.dropboxusercontent.comu324723Webvidiframefixedissue.html relnofollowhttpsdl.dropboxusercontent.comu324723Webvidiframefixedissue.htmlap  pExpected behaviour is  Scroll down, then tap on the header while its overlapping some text. The header text has an anchor hover tag, so itll turn black. This is what should happen.p  pRefresh, then scroll the page down until the header overlaps the first video Vine, then try and click on the header, over where the video should be say the letter A, itll load up the video.p  pRefresh, then scroll down the page until the header overlaps the second video YouTube, and try again itll work properly, because YouTube has a splash screen. However, if you then load the YouTube video, click Done to get out of the video, and repeat this process, youll have the same issue as with the Vine video, because the splash screen is gone and the iOS Video frame has replaced it. Vine has no splash screen, so this issue is apparent immediately.p  pWhy is it displaying the header above the videos, but still prioritising the video on tap This is only an issue with iOS, Android seems fine. Am I doing something wrong, or is this an inherent issue with iOSp  pedit This is an issue on other sites too see Mashable or Instagram. Im not so sure theres a way around this.p

Negative 34480 pSo I am trying to make a website and have a popup windowbox that appears after clicking something. This popup window contains textcontent, lets name it Locations, as per my websites design. This Locations Popup box has a fixed height and width, and consequently, there is a vertical scroll bar Ive created to scroll down and read the text. I would like to add more content to this popup but unfortunately, the text is being cutoff, and the scroll does not continue scrolling down. TO be more specific, how can I add in or change something such that the vertical scroll will resizeshrink itself so as to accommodate for the extra text I am adding Currently, the text is just cutoff in the window, and I cannot scroll down to read it. In correct applications of vertical scroll bar integration, by my understanding, the scroll bar should resize itself so that all the text until the very end can be scrolled and read. Please let me know if other code snippets are necessary for this. Below is the CSS for itp  precode Pop Up  popupAbout, popupLocations, popupContact, popupBlog      height 600px     width 900px     overflow scroll     backgroundcolor rgba0, 0, 0, 0.75     border 2px solid cecece     zindex 15     padding 20px     color FFF     webkitboxshadow 0px 0px 4px 000 inset     mozboxshadow 0px 0px 4px 000 inset     boxshadow 0px 0px 4px 000 inset     webkitborderradius 10px     mozborderradius 10px     oborderradius 10px     msborderradius 10px     khtmlborderradius 10px     borderradius 10px     margintop 50px     visibility hidden  codepre  pAnd to make it a bit easier in providing me assistance with this, Ive added the JS for it as well p  precodeLocations Page Pop Up             var popupLocationsStatus  0              function loadPopupLocations                 ifpopupLocationsStatus0                     popupLocations.fadeInslow                     popupLocationsStatus  1                                            function disablePopupLocations                 ifpopupLocationsStatus1                     popupLocations.fadeOutslow                     popupLocationsStatus  0                                            function centerPopupLocations                 var windowWidth  document.documentElement.clientWidth                 var windowHeight  document.documentElement.clientHeight                 var popupLocationsHeight  popupLocations.height                 var popupLocationsWidth  popupLocations.width                 popupLocations.css                     position absolute,                     top windowHeight2popupLocationsHeight2,                     left windowWidth2popupLocationsWidth2                                             document.readyfunction                 popupLocations.fadeOut                 popupLocationsStatus  0                 Locations.clickfunction                 popupLocations.css                     visibility visible                      disablePopupAbout                     disablePopupContact                                       centerPopupLocations                     loadPopupLocations                                  popupLocationsClose.clickfunction                     disablePopupLocations                                           function                              popupLocations.jScrollPane                 .popupLocations.jScrollPane                                              showArrows true,                         horizontalGutter 10                                                    codepre

Negative 34480 pIm writing a web application that uses tinymce to edit documents.  In my web application, there is support for dragdrop to insert links to files saved in the system.p  pThe issue I have is when I try to insert a link into a tinymce document in Firefox.  When I drag a file from my file viewer and drop it into the document, the document inserts the link, but the cursor disappears inside the document.  I can, however, type from where the cursor should be.

It is a config object to handle various options of the command to execute, such as whether the document being modified should gain focus.  So I replace the second line above withp  precodetinymce.getmyDocPage.execCommandmceInsertContent, false, link, skipfocus true codepre  pAfter doing this, I can just click back into the document and the cursor appears but the edit starts at the newly placed link and all new text will be part of the link.  p  pNone of the above behavior happens in Chrome.  Chrome properly handles the insert and changes focus to the document with the cursor present.p  pHas anyone come across this issue before  If so, how was it fixed or is there a workaround  It seems that Firefox isnt handling the focus correctly.p  pBelow is link to a js fiddle that shows the issue. a hrefhttpfiddle.tinymce.comO3daab1 relnofollowhttpfiddle.tinymce.comO3daab1ap

Negative 34480 pI was playing around with type casting earlier today, and came across a something interesting. The C compiler is unable to cast code0code or code1code to a boolean data type. For examplep  precodebool b  bool0 codepre  pwould return false if it was able to compile.p  pThere doesnt seem to be any loss of information here, so my question is, is there some specific reason the C compiler doesnt let you do thisp

Negative 34480 pIm just experimenting with a few ideas and currently have an idea for a site layout that would involve randomising the styles of particular elements on a web page. For example, if I have 10 paragraphs on a single page I would like each one to have a random font size, family and colour.p  pThese styles could be dynamically generated, or taken from a set of random styles present in a stylesheet.p  pIf anybody has any ideas on the neatest solutions for achieving this, all thoughts would be gratefully received, maybe Im searching for the wrong terms but thus far Google hasnt really given me any food for thought.p
Negative 34480 pIm working on a webserver. I can have an endpoint that compiles data in multiple transactions, or all in a single transaction. Which would be faster Betterp

Negative 34480 pRecently, I have made an R package, which use Rcpp to integrate R and C.  And the C library Boost is used for multithreading.  I wonder if is it possible for my package to be built on a hrefhttpwinbuilder.rproject.org relnofollowhttpwinbuilder.rproject.orgap  pI found that a Make variable  BOOSTLIB  is defined, as shown in a hrefhttpcran.rproject.orgbinwindowscontribThirdPartySoftware.html relnofollowhttpcran.rproject.orgbinwindowscontribThirdPartySoftware.htmla.p  pI tried to use the headeronly libraries, its OK, but when I tried to use separatelycompiled library Boost.Thread, either no such file or undefined reference error came out.  Maybe the lib path was wrong.  However, I can hardly find any words explained on winbuilder.  Can I only use the headeronly libraries or Is there a way to configure Makevars.win to find the separatelycompiled Boost.Thread libraryp  pOr maybe I can include Boost source filed in my package, but I dont think it is a good way, and I also dont know how to include I havent tried.p  pI found there is an R package BH trying to provide Boost for R.  It is very helpful, and I appreciate the work done by the authors of BH very much, however, the Boost.Thread is not included when I asked this question.  Maybe I can wait until when they include Boost.Thread.  But I prefer to do it myself now, so I can learn more.p

Both way to much in my opinion. p  pThen I tried the same in my commandline with zip r archive folder and that took only 4 minutes. strongEDITstrong Have not been able to get zip under 40 min lately.

Negative 34480 pIm setting a couple of default headers using codehttp.defaults.headers.commoncode for communication with our API e.g. the emAuthorizationem header. This saves me a lot of trouble of specifying these headers on every individual codehttpcode request or coderesourcecode declaration.p  pHowever, in one place Im making an codehttp.getcode call to the Foursquare API and the fact that the additional headers exist is a problem a obviously I dont want to send the authorization header to anything other than our API and b the existence of the headers forces codehttpcode to use CORS and Foursquare rejects the OPTIONS request.p  pIs there any way I can set the defaults on a perhost basis or using some other context Ive tried moving the directive that contacts Foursquare into its own module hoping the defaults might be isolated that way but theyre not.p  pI guess I can codedeletecode the additional headers from codehttp.defaultscode prior to the Foursquare request and restore them afterwards but it feels like a horrible hack and might be problematic if any requests to our API are attempted while waiting for the Foursquare response to come back.p

Negative 34480 pIm making a service that watches a certain directory and when it detects changes in code in that directory, it runs all the tests in the directory. Purpose is that it runs the tests on the changes in code in that directory.

But the classes remain the ones before the changes. Before the service started watching, i.e before runtime.p  pHow can I force those classes used in the tests to also be dynamically loadedp

Negative 34480 pIm relatively new to Android, and working on an app that will load bitmaps into a dynamically created layout with an ImageView. The number of layouts and ImageViews is based on some dynamic data i.e. an API call. I want to load Bitmaps into these ImageViews after they have been dynamically created and add them to the main layout. Since I will be creating multiple dynamic layouts and loading multiple bitmaps this cant be done synchronously on the main thread. Im currently using a solution based on AsyncTasks but Im thinking there might be a more efficient method possibly using HandlerRunnable.p  pCurrently, I have implemented a solution that uses AsyncTasks in the following way p  p1 Launch the first AsyncTask from the main threadp  precodeforEvent event  events.getEventList     Create an UpdateCalendarUITask to update the UI   CalendarUpdateTask calendarTask  new CalendarUpdateTaskthis, parentView   calendarTask.executeevent  codepre  p2 Create and populate the layout adding Text and Image views, add the newly created dynamic view to the layout, and call back to the main thread on completion using an interface.p  precodepublic class CalendarUpdateTask extends AsyncTaskltEvent, Void, RelativeLayoutgt     private final WeakReferenceltActivitygt activityReference   private final WeakReferenceltViewGroupgt parentViewReference   ....   public CalendarUpdateTaskContext context, ViewGroup parentView      parentViewReference  new WeakReferenceltViewGroupgtparentView     activityReference  new WeakReferenceltActivitygtActivity context       Override   protected RelativeLayout doInBackgroundEvent... params      myEvent  params[0]     return updateGameViewmyEvent  returns created RelativeLayout       Override   protected void onPostExecuteRelativeLayout result      super.onPostExecuteresult      Add the GameEvent view to the Events View     if  Reference and nulls checks           ViewGroup parentView  parentViewReference.get                     parentView.addViewresult         TaskListener listener  TaskListener activityReference.get         listener.loadImagesmyEvent           ....      codepre  p3 The listener function loadImages... launches another AsyncTask that loads the bitmaps similar to a hrefhttpdeveloper.android.comtrainingdisplayingbitmapsprocessbitmap.html relnofollowthisap  pThis works ok. However, it is still a little slow loading lots of images because bitmaps arent loaded until after the views is created. I cant call it before because I dont have a reference to the ImageView until after it is created. I cant launch the second AsyncTask from CalendarUpdateTask because it must always be launched from the main thread.p  pIdeally I would prefer to launch both operations at the same time and have a callback that is notified once both operations are done so that the bitmap can be loaded into the new ImageView.p  pThere has to be a better option correct Thanks in advance.p

Negative 34480 pI maintain a crossplatform C codebase and on a few platforms Xcode 4, Red Hat derived distros like Fedora and Mageia, I get the following compiler errorp  precodewarning declaration of index shadows a global declaration codepre  pBased on a hrefhttpstackoverflow.coma84409932038264this answera, I understand that this is because some BSDbased C implementations define a nonstandard codeindexcode function in codestring.hcode which means that this warning shows up whenever I declare an codeindexcode variable. I assure you that I do not have any global codeindexcode variables.p  pI know I can avoid naming anything codeindexcode but its a semantically useful name so I end up using it all over the place. I know I can also suppress this warning, for example by using codeWnoshadowcode in GCC, but Id rather not globally disable an otherwise useful compiler warning.p  pSo how can I solve this problem That is, is it somehow possible to detect if the platform has the codeindexcode function and disable the warning there only, or how can I redefine it if it existsp

Negative 34480 pI have an HTMLJSCSS app thats been added to the home screen on an iPad.  This is strongnotstrong a cached HTML app  it doesnt have cache.manifest and is supposed to pull data from the server.p  pFor some crazy reasons, its cached the CSS file and refuses to get the new version from the server.  Mobile safari does show the latest version correctly.  I deleted the home screen icon, killed the app in the recent list, cleared safari cache, cookies and website data, killed safari in the recent apps and and readded the home screen icon again after ensuring that I am seeing the latest data on safari.  When I run it, its still using the old cached version of the CSS.p  pIts worth noting that it took about 20 restarts for it to see the updated images and javascript files, but its still not seeing the new css.p  pAny pointers are more than welcome.p  pP.S. I managed to solve this on my own ipad by connecting it to the computer, going into the dev console and refreshing from there, however I cant force the client to do the same least because the client doesnt have a mac  I need a way to force it to refresh the files from ipad alone, without involving any other hardware.p

Negative 34480 pIve made a simple activity with 6 codeViewFlipperscode. Each codeViewFlippercode has 4 images that has a fade in, fade out animation. When I tried it on my device, it runs fine. But when I try it on my other devices, it doesnt show any animation. The settings for the animation for the other phones is the same with my phone, having animations at 1x. This might be a limitation on the memory capacity of the other devices so my question is, is there any thing more simpler and lighter that can support 6 or more slidelike viewsp
Negative 34480 pI was wondering what way would be the smartes to pack 2 texture coords for fast usage in vertex shaders given the following circumstancesp  ul liBoth texture coords can only be either 1.0f or 0.0f  1 Bit each would be enoughli liI will have to pack those 2 coords into a GLByte 8 bit attribute variable however it would be best if 6 bits remain available for other usagesli ul  pMy issues are that Im not that familiar with the bitlayout of floats to do it myself, but I can imagine that only 1 bit in a 0.0f needs to get flipped to become a 1.0f  i just dunno which one using only bitwise ops this should be incredible fast btw are gpus also faster about bitwise stuff compared to arithmetic, like CPUs . p

Negative 34480 pI am building a user interface where users must be able to concurrently make edits on a web page. The standard technique employed in 90 of our application is optimistic locking that is, we expect that concurrent edits will open happen very rarely, and if they do, the second committer gets an error and loses their edit.p  pIn limited parts of the application, concurrent edits are expected, and we need to handle them in a better way. Locking to force sequential editing is not an option, as it would require a timeout on the lock for the situation where a user walks away from their screen without explicitly unlocking, which would be very annoying.p  pIf possible, I would like to hold the form data as XML, but to allow concurrent edits to this document to be made.p  pSome tools I have briefly looked into that may be able to do this, or provide some inspiration in how best to handle it arep  pApache Wave Google Wave a hrefhttpincubator.apache.orgwave relnofollowhttpincubator.apache.orgwaveap  pMobWrite a hrefhttpcode.google.compgooglemobwrite relnofollowhttpcode.google.compgooglemobwriteap  pDoes anyone have some more suggestions of toolkits or techniques that could handle this Thanks for your help.p

Negative 34480 pI am using CakePHP 2.3.6. In one of my projects, I want to use codeAjaxcode for codesearching datacode. My plan is, user will input parametersfields to search specific data. After they input data, an codeAjax requestcode will be sent to the controller and the controller will return the result data and the result data will be shown in a codespecific divcode.p  pSo, first I tried to return the result in normal codephp arraycode and show that array in a codetablecode.

So, can you please give me an example of how to do it p  pThanksp

Negative 34480 pI want to apply a background foreground segmentation to a Jpeg image. The algorithm is called Grabcut and the code is available online. My image is 48963264 pixels. The problem is when I pass the image into the code, it opens the image 100 magnified as the input, which is too big for my computer screen to view. Actually the program is interactive where I need to mark an area over the object in the image that I want to extract and so the image opens as an input. The code is written in python. Can anyone tell me, how to open say just 10 magnified image Thanks   p

Negative 34480 pI am tasked with installing and configuring a two node cluster to use as a proof of concept for Hadoop. The cluster contains one machine that is both a master and slave, and the other a slave. Both are installed on Ubuntu 14.04 virtual machines with 16GB RAM.p  pSo I was able to get Hadoop 2.4 installed on both machines, got hdfs, yarn, hive etc running successfully. My problem now is once I start to add larger filesmore data, the queries are crazy slow. p  pselect countem from programs for example. Programs contains 45000 rows for a total of about 2.5 MB. After initialization it takes only a few seconds to get the result.  Now running the same query on another table containing almost 17 million rows, 3.6GB, takes significantly longer As I know it should. If I run countem, or and variation of it on this large table it takes variable amounts of time. The first time it takes 4 minutes. I run it immediately after the first finishes and it take 17 minutes. Nothing changes between runs, so Im not sure what is going on. Often times during these long runs the machines will freeze and become unresponsive to any input. Map will remain at 0 for 5 mins, jump to about 30, then slowly increase.p  pMy question is is this normal behaviour I would expect the same job to have a consistent run time if I run it right away again. Perhaps there is an underlying issue with Ubuntu, Im not sure. If I monitor CPU or disk usage during a job they are both never is crazy high territory so Im not sure where its getting hung up. Looking at log files doesnt show any exceptions. If a job is especially slow getting upwards of 45 minutes, log files will show a bunch of SocketTimeoutExceptions. p  pIve played with different config options but nothing seems to really help.p  pAny help would be appreciated.p

Negative 34480 pI built a huge backbone.js app which works this way p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comJDf9R.png altenter image description herep  pAs you can see, there is a strongDatastrong backbone.js model, which values are accessed by getters in strongGetters.jsstrong and the values are used in strongUnderscore templatesstrong to define some inline styling. The contents in the page are present in another Backbone model, called strongContentsstrong.p  pThe page is basically built by three elements  stronga menu, a content, and a bottom barstrong. each one of these elements have their own templates strongbut they are all included in the same templatestrong. This means that View.js, in its render function, fills the page body by running the main template, which displays the menu, and which includes the content and bottom bar templates.p  pThis worked very well until I deployed that in production the Data backbone model is built from a JSON file which comes from another app, and what I didnt know is that this strongJSON can sometimes be different than what I expected with my getters.strong This means that some values may be missing, some which are expected as a string could be an object containing that string and so on.p  pThis is a huge problem because the getters often produce cannot read value color of undefined. If all they did was returning values from the backbone model, it would be OK because they would simply return strongundefinedstrong values or other values than the ones expected. But because they also strongdo some logicstrong as shown by getBottomBarColor in my example, they get undefined or unexpected typed values and try to work with it, which makes them crash.p  pThe templates are nested, and precompiled by browserify.js into JS functions. This means that if a getter crashes at some point, the whole function which means the whole template crashes, strongresulting in a blank pagestrong.p  pCode is already in production and it is too late to change the way this whole app is built. I have been thinking of some way to handle malformed Data problems. strongMy getters.Js file is 3000 lines bigstrong so it would be too long to make some manual edit to put try catches everywhere in it, so I thought about putting something like this at the end of getters.js p  precode.eachgetters, functiongetterFunction, getterName     getters[getterName]  function         try             return getterFunction.applythis, arguments          catche             sendErrorToDevByAjaxe, getterName             return                   codepre  pThis would avoid crashes in the getters, but this would be slowtry catch, and this is not unbreakable as I return an empty string in case of a crash, which is OK if the template expected a string there, but if the template expected a bool or an object, it is going to crash anyway so I would have to put try catches in template calls too, this would become way too slow in my opinionp  pIf someone has an idea of something else which i could do to prevent crashes, or a way of doing what I plan to do strongbetterstrong, i will gladly take it.p

Negative 34480 pI am wanting to have my app show a view on first launch that lets the user select the default view controller to open every time they launch the app. For example, the first time a user launches the app they are presented with a screen that has options to select News, Weather, My Account, etc. If they select News, the new view controller is opened and every time the app is launched, the News view is shown by default. There would then be a preferences section of the main menu that allows the user to change their default view. Im just not sure how to go about implementing this and storing the user preference.p

Negative 34480 pIve built a large function which calls numerous gbm functions in a big loop. All Im trying to do is increase the thickness of the tickmarks in rug which is called by gbm.plot.p  pI was hoping to use e.g.p  precodebodygbm.plot[[24]][[4]][[3]][[3]][[3]][[3]][[2]]ylab lt change value codepre  pFrom a hrefhttpsstackoverflow.comquestions2458013whatwaysaretheretoeditafunctioninrthisa pages examples, which Ive used successfully elsewhere, but the section in question in gbm.plot is in an IF statement, so as.list doesnt nicely recurse the lines because arguably its all one huge long line. You emcanem get to them by just manually [[trying]][[successive]][[combinations]] until you get to the right place, but since Im trying to insert a piece of code code, lwd6code into a bracketed statement, rather than assigning a value to a named subobject, Im not sure how to get trace to do this.p  ptrace saysp  precodeWhen the at argument is supplied, it can be a vector of integers referring to the substeps of the body of the function this only works if the body of the function is enclosed in  .... In this case tracer is not called on entry, but instead just before evaluating each of the steps listed in at. Hint you dont want to try to count the steps in the printed version of a function instead, look at as.listbodyf to get the numbers associated with the steps in function f.  The at argument can also be a list of integer vectors. In this case, each vector refers to a step nested within another step of the function. For example, at  listc3,4 will call the tracer just before the fourth step of the third step of the function codepre  pSo I tried pasting the whole line with the lwd bit added in, hoping that it would overwrite it with the small additionp  precodetrace gbm.plot, quoterugquantiledata[, gbm.callgbm.x[variable.no]], probs  seq0, 1, 0.1, na.rm  TRUE,lwd6, atc22,4,7,3,3,3,2 codepre  p...as well as putting objects in amp out of brackets, all to no avail. Does anyone know either the correct way of using trace for this, or can suggest a better way Thanksp  pp.s. it needs to be done automatically with coding so users can load the function which will load the vanilla gbm functions from CRAN and then make tweaks as required.p  pEDIT found a workaround. But generalisable question how can one insert elements into an IF statemented part of a function e.g. Fromp  precoderugquantiledata[, gbm.callgbm.x[variable.no]], probsseq0, 1, 0.1, na.rmTRUE codepre  ptop  precoderugquantiledata[, gbm.callgbm.x[variable.no]], probsseq0, 1, 0.1, na.rmTRUE,lwd6 codepre

Negative 34480 pOkay, so here is the concept. My HTML document has a button that onClick runs a Javascript function. On the web page there are two big divisions, and the purpose of the button is to swap the divisions places.

Negative 34480 pI have a directory which another process throws files into.p  pOur current implementation of Storm reads this directory and selects the oldest file and opens a reader to the file. This reader is held as a field within the spout so when nextTuple is called, a single line is output from the file. Once the spout has finished reading it closes the reader and opens a new reader to a new file.p  pTo increase the throughput an idea was to have multiple spouts reading multiple files at once, as these spouts will be fighting over the same files in the same directory, is there a way to communicate between spouts so they can negotiate on which files to read Or have an overall manager which allocates files to spouts.p  pThe directory and files are stored and read from HDFS.p

I expected the codezcode variant to run faster since it requires one less table lookup. On the contrary the codeqcode variant is consistently faster.

Negative 34480 pI have this little test proggy that tracks PIDs as they are created and shut down.  I am investigating a problem that my proggy has found and would like to ask you about this in order to have a better idea on whats going on.p  pWhen a windows process is started, it gets a PID but when the process is shut down, does the PID become retired like a star basketballers jersey number or is it possible for a new, entirely  unrelated, process to be created under that released PIDp  pThanksp

Negative 34480 pHere is a generalized code I am working on. The problem is how to halt 2ndthread till all subthreads have been executed and mainthread is sleeping.

Negative 34480 pFirst, is it possible to edit GCC command line settings so that I dont have to compile with the stdc99 flag every time p  pSecondly, why is c99 not the default behavior to begin with Compiling with c99 allows for certain modern programming conventions such as creating and initializing the index variable in a for loop.p  precodeforint i  0 i lt 10 i ... codepre  pWithout the c99 flag, this would not be possible and i would have to be declared externally on its own line which I think is silly.

Negative 34480 pI am trying to use Optaplanner to do some sort of Course Scheduling but, instead of have isolated courses, I have a group of them that have to occur one after other. I am not sure if it is clear, let me give an example Group1c1,c2,c3,c4,Group2c1,c2,c3,c4,c5,c6, Group3c5,c6,c7,c8. My problem is In order to choose the best period, I create the combination of all possible periods to each course and I wrote the rules to assert a lot of conditions. For example, if course2Group1 is not just after course1Group1 I break a hard constraint. OptaPlanner is solving the problem, but it takes 12 hours to achieve the best solution. The big problem is the amount of data, there are a lot of periods that are not used because it should pick only one of the possibilities to each Course and verify if the periods choosen for courses of the same group are satisfying the conditions.p  pDo you have any tip about the way that I created my Domain model Any tip about performance I am using some selector filters already...p

Dont know why. But my question is another.

Negative 34480 pAlright so the trouble is not detecting the word. The issue I am having is the process of actually rewriting the string without the word that needs removal.p  pI loop through the string, and then use my detection algorithm to find the word. I keep an index of the first character of the word in a register for usage later lets call it codebadWordIndexcode.p  pI then remove the word by traversing through the entire string again. Once I get to the codebadWordIndexcode, I add 3 to the index of the string midloop so that I can skip the specified word and it wont be stored by my codestrbcode instruction.p  pThe memory map doesnt appear to be skipping the detected word as I debug. It loads the characters of it like any other word, stores them, and continues based on the red hexs in the memory map.p  pAnyone know what could be going wrong How could I do this in an alternative fashionp  precode        AREA Question1, CODE, READONLY         ENTRY         ldr r0, STRING1 r0 points to STRING1 so that it can be accessed and used EoS     equ 0 SpaceCh equ 32         ldr r2, STRING2 r5 points to STRING2 so that it can be accessed and used.

Negative 34480 pI have a Grails application that connects to a Postgres Plus Advanced Server. I have a domain in my Grails application that has a column of sqlType VARCHARMAX. When the table is created by GORM, the column with the sqlType VARCHARMAX were created as Text.

Negative 34480 pThe codeUIcode elements in the codeMainActivitycode class need to be preserved and the other class file adds a new codeUIcode element to the main codexmlcode layout thats used by both classes to differing degrees. p  pIts understood that you can create a base abstract class and two concrete inherited classes however in this case there a third supporting class for the second other class and it requires a handler to function.p  pFor perspective, a button in codeactivitymaincode is clicked and it should launch an activity while maintaining the codeUIcode elements used codeMainActivitycode. Furthermore the button has its own class file methods and isnt in codeMainActivitycode.p  pWhat happens now The button is pressed and nothing happens. Manifest confirmed so its not that.

Negative 34480 pIve been tracking this bug for days and finally realized the issue is that there is an actual delay with codeWKInterfaceController.openParentApplicationcode. I am not referring to the callback in the Apple Watch, but the codeAppDelegatecode event in the iPhone.p  pHeres what Im doing in the Apple Watchp  precodeoverride func awakeWithContextcontext AnyObject    var userInfo  [     test 123   ]    WKInterfaceController.openParentApplicationuserInfo, reply nil  codepre  pThen in the iPhone, Im doing this in codeAppDelegatecodep  precodefunc applicationapplication UIApplication, handleWatchKitExtensionRequest userInfo [NSObject  AnyObject], reply [NSObject  AnyObject] gt Void    let test  userInfo[test]    Do something  codepre  pThe problem is when I call codeWKInterfaceController.openParentApplicationcode, there is a 2 or 3 second delay before the codehandleWatchKitExtensionRequestcode event is triggered in the iPhone. This is problematic if the user performs an action on their watch really quickly and puts down their arm right after. I cant assume the user is going to hold up their arm for 3 seconds until the watch sends the command.p  pHeres the catch if the user wakes up the watch, the command still doesnt get sent to the iPhone.. UNTIL the user opens up the original app that sent the codeWKInterfaceController.openParentApplicationcode. I dont think any of this would be a problem without this catch, the command should be queued until the watch is awakened, not awakened AND reopen the app.p  pAny workaround that can be done for this I plan on logging this as a bug, but wanted to see if anyone has any thoughts or experience with thisp

Negative 34480 pSo Im very new at making apps or GUI programs in general but I felt like I could take on this challenge as Im decently adept at python and VBA. Im trying to make a visual schedule builder app for my university using a windows 8 app running in C and xaml. The data for all courses is split up into .csv files, one for each department to make searching easier. These files are to be included in the assets of the app itself as I dont want to have to figure out how to host the data remotely right now unless that would make this task easier.p  pIm having trouble extracting the data from these files into my app. In my app there are currently two comboboxes that Im working on. One for the department and one for the courses within that department, such as MECH 2202 for a specific class in mechanical engineering. I want that when the first combo is selected for MECH, the second combo populates with all different course codes in that department which are in a single .csv file. More details would be used later when the course code is chosen as theres several sections for each, though that can be figured out later.p  pThe relevant xaml for testing purposes is the following. The numbers populating the second box are just temporary.p  precode        ltComboBox xNamedepartmentCombo HorizontalAlignmentCenter Margin0 Grid.Row1 VerticalAlignmentCenter Width100 Height40 MaxDropDownHeight400 SelectionChangedDepartmentChangegt             ltComboBoxItem ContentBIOEgt             ltComboBoxItem ContentCIVLgt             ltComboBoxItem ContentECEgt             ltComboBoxItem ContentENGgt             ltComboBoxItem ContentMECHgt         ltComboBoxgt         ltComboBox xNamecourseCombo HorizontalAlignmentCenter Margin0 Grid.Row1 VerticalAlignmentCenter Width100 Height40 MaxDropDownHeight400gt             ltComboBoxItem Content2012gt             ltComboBoxItem Content2202gt             ltComboBoxItem Content3542gt             ltComboBoxItem Content3582gt             ltComboBoxItem Content3980gt         ltComboBoxgt codepre  pFor example, all of the mechanical engineering courses are located in a single .csv file named Course ListMECH.csv located in the assets of the app. The data is structured as followsp  precode    department,coursecode,[several other nonrelevant fields] codepre  pMy C code so far for the event after a department has been chosen is thisp  precode    private void DepartmentChangeobject sender, SelectionChangedEventArgs e               ComboBoxItem typeItem  ComboBoxItemdepartmentCombo.SelectedItem         string departmentstr  typeItem.Content.ToString          testText.Text  departmentstr          broken         var reader  new StreamReaderFile.OpenReadCtest.csv         Listltstringgt listA  new Listltstringgt         Listltstringgt listB  new Listltstringgt         while reader.EndOfStream                      var line  reader.ReadLine             var values  line.Split              listA.Addvalues[0]             listB.Addvalues[1]               codepre  pThe first part of this code functions to extract the chosen department and goes into a testing textblock to make sure its working.

Im not adept enough at C to see why its not even compiling. It says that The name File does not exist in the current context.

Negative 34480 pHi I am really new to Android ROM customization and I am trying to understand the basis. I have successfully built AOSP for Android 5.1.1r9 and I have flashed it to my Nexus 4 and it worked although many functionalities are missed. To add the missing functionalities I have tried to unpack the system.img file, contained in the factory image for the Nexus 4 I have got from Google, and I moved some files to the unpacked AOSP system.img file. Unfortunately packing the new system.img and flashing it to the phone resulted in a boot loop. I then tried to verify if this method can work unpacking and repacking the ASPO system.img file without doing any modification. The result was the same boot loop. I noticed the repacked system.img named newsystem.img it is smaller than the original one. I have used hexdiff to compare the files and there are other differences other than the size. Am I missing something I am using the ext4utils built by the AOSP build to issue the following commandsp  precodesimg2img system.img system.img.raw mkdir newsystem sudo mount system.img.raw newsystem sudo makeext4fs s l 880803840 a system newsystem.img newsystem codepre  pthe original system.img has got size 358016680, the system.img.raw file has got size 880803840, the newsystem.img file has got size 358012572p  pMany thanks.

Negative 34480 pIm currently creating a website which is created by three main divs on one page. Inbetween each div, I have a faint hr to help visually split them up.p  pBetween my first and second divs, the hr displays fine.p  pBetween the second and third is my problem  the hr displays underneath the second div. I have a feeling it is to do with the relative positioning of the container of my second div, but that is needed for me to position images within in.p  pI have tried displayblock and wrapping the second div inside another container amongst other things, but nothing has yet worked.p  pI could try using div with a backgroundborder rather than hr, but im not sure if this is the right way to

Negative 34480 pI am building a GPSbased app which displays the location whenever  code voidlocationUpdateCLLocation locationcode gets triggered by codeCoreLocationControllercode. While it returns very reasonable results when driving faster than 20mph30kph drifting 1 kph it is awful when moving around at 6mph10kph drifting 5 kph. Is there any recommend way of smoothing that data I thought of 2 waysp  ul liapplying a lowpass filter  I am a musician and quite familiar to that topic, however all the data Ive been applying a lowpass to is audio, I have no clue if similar techniques work for other data as wellli licalculating an average of x events and take the average  sounds way easier to implement as I would just take a kind of buffer, add the values and divide them by their amount.li lilog geo data and calculate the speed after every x meters distance similar to the above methodli ul  pThe apps sole purpose is to display the speed of walkersrunnersbicycle drivers. While the latter is not a problem because with great speed comes great precision, unfortunately you cant apply this to the other 2 target groups. This is why I think less recent but more precise data is a good tradeoff for that.p  pNote I remember my old Nokia 5800 delivering strongverystrong reliable data regarding speed. On the other hand it was explicitly advertised with its navigation features so I am not sure if they simply used better hardware. I cant remember the update frequency on that device tho, it might actually smoothen the data in a way I intend to do it, too. p
Negative 34480 pIm trying to animate a circular div to give a ripplelike effect, filling its container. There should be an initial ripple the border, followed by the main shape expanding to fill the container.p  pIm accomplishing the ripple by animating the borderwidth of the circle div in combination with the padding, thereby pushing the border outwards.p  pThe problem is, the bounding box of the circle div flickers white while the padding is animating. If I remove the padding portion of the animation, and just animate the borderwidth, there is no flickering, so I know it is the padding that is causing the problem.p  precodekeyframes circle  0      width0.001px     borderwidth0px     padding0px  50      width0.001px     borderwidth100px     padding400px  100      width125     borderwidth100px     padding400px   codepre  pa hrefhttpsjsfiddle.netx8f0qby83 relnofollowHeres a fiddlea to demonstrate.

Ive tried these, and neither have fixed it.p  pOriginally, I accomplished this animation using multiple circular divs and a series of classes with transitions representing various states of animation, then triggering those classes using setInterval delays. Now that Im more familiar with CSS animation, Im trying to recode it to be more CPUfriendly, as the old method chugged along on older laptops. Im assuming a single circle div compared to multiple, and a single animation being called rather than constant adding and removing of classes would be more efficientp

For example, a green dot for   the measure time means that this View has a faster measure time than   50 of the View objects in the tree. p      pYellow For this part of the   render time, this View is in the slower 50 of all the View objects in   the tree. For example, a yellow dot for the layout time means that   this View has a slower layout time than 50 of the View objects in the   tree. p      pRed For this part of the render time, this View is the slowest   one in the tree. For example, a red dot for the draw time means that   this View takes the most time to draw of all the View objects in the   tree.p blockquote  pIf Im not mistaken, doesnt that mean that there should always be at most 3 views with red dots the slowest views for each category  measure, layout, draw, and then half of views yellow and half green. p  pFirst of all I see more than 3 views with red dots and I dont understand why.p  pSecond, I dont see how these values can help improve performance considering that these are relative values.

Negative 34480 pI set some codeNSTextFieldcodes inside my viewbased codeNSTableViewcode to be editable, and to send an action on end editing so when Enter or Tab is pressed, or when the focus is lost. The behavior when hitting Tab is perfect the cell on the right of the current one gets selected and is ready to be edited. Same goes for ShiftTab. When hitting Enter, the field is deactivated but the same row stays selected, which is the normal behavior.  What I want to achieve is a vertical version of what Tab does, with the Enter key. p  pTo be clear Im editing a codeNSTextFieldcode inside my table. I hit Enter. I want the next row to become selected, and the field in the same column that I was editing previously should become activated meaning it turns into an editable codeNSTextFieldcode with its current content highlighted. The action should still be triggered normally, like it would if you hit Tab while editing a cell.p  pIs that possible If yes, how would I proceedp  pI thought about subclassing codeNSTextFieldcode and playing with codekeyDowncode a little, but I think I would then have to use the notification center to trigger a callback that would make the row selection change in my table and the activation of the next table cell. This seems like overkill, and I wouldnt know how to make the latter happen activate the NSTextField for editing.p  pThanksp
