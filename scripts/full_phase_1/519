Positive 519 pI am currently trying to record a video in square shape and create a output as .mp4. It seems to be really challenging. I tried diffrent approches including OnPreviewFrame and FFMpeg. But never got a satisfing result. Today i found Grafika. And it seems to be the right way. But because of the complextity of the Code i am stuck now. Using the Example CameraCaptureActivity.java i managed to record a video. But its shape is rectangluar and not square. Furthermore the camera is rotated by 90 degrees.  I was already trying to manipulate certain parameters but never got a good video. Some where squeezed and so on.p  pDoes anybody know what parameters i need to change inside Grafikas example to get the right result  In the end the camera of my android phone should record Videos like Vine or Instagram.p  pThanks for your helpp
Positive 519 pI have been searching, testing, and coming up with nothing for over a week.  I want to use FFMPEG to convert mp4s and mkvs to AVI files that will play on my DLink DSM520.  Mencoder will do it. The files that FFMPEG generates cause the player to lock up less than a minute into the video.  First, heres what I use to encode the file using Mencoder scraped from the test.bat file that PocketDIVXEncoder generatesp  precodemencoder.exe ftwd105.mp4 af volnorm srate 44100 oac mp3lame lameopts mode0cbrbr128 noodml vf ppac,scale720404,crop720400,harddup sws 9 ovc lavc lavcopts vcodecmpeg4mbd1lastpred2vstrict1threads2vmaxbframes0vbitrate1200 ffourcc XVID o ftwd105HDTV.avi codepre  pThe output file plays perfectly on the DSM520.

It plays choppy with only clicking for sound for about 1530 seconds, then it freezes.  Looking at it with FFPROBE, it looks exactly the same as the one created by Mencoder.p  precodeInput 0, avi, from ftwd105ffmpeg.avi   Metadata     encoder          Lavf57.0.100   Duration 004433.14, start 0.000000, bitrate 1305 kbs     Stream 00 Video mpeg4 Simple Profile XVID  0x44495658, yuv420p, 720x400 [SAR 11 DAR 95], 1165 kbs, 23.98 fps, 23.98 tbr, 23.98 tbn, 24k tbc     Stream 01 Audio mp3 U[0][0][0]  0x0055, 44100 Hz, stereo, s16p, 128 kbs codepre  pSo now I encode the video using Xvid4PSP.

Is FFMPEG incapable of generating a file that the DSM520 can play The reason I want to use FFMPEG over Mencoder is that its much faster. What takes FFMPEG 15 minutes takes Mencoder 40.p  pI should note that all the files created by FFMPEG play fine on the PC and on my Visio television.  The DSM520 is hooked up to a bedroom tv that isnt a smart tv.p

Positive 519 pIve hit a complete brick wall in my attempt to use NVEnc to stream OpenGL frames as H264.

Positive 519 pI host a site on a Linux server that I built with php where I am able to upload audio files in one section and video files to another. Each section uses php to upload a single audio file and a single video file. Each upload is assigned a unique filename so they can be viewed separately on an individual page where the uploader can post comments about their audio or video. I want to be able to allow musicians and performers in the local area display their work.  The site works, but large video files do not upload and my audio player only plays a few formats, and I like to convert them all to mp3s.  I installed ffmpeg on my linux server to help me with this and am able to connect to it with my terminal.  My question is how do I get ffmpeg to interface with my uploaded php files. For example, as the user uploads an audio file, can I have ffmpeg convert it while its uploading, or do I need to set up a temporary folder for uploads, store it there, then have ffmpeg compress the file, convert it to a specific format and save it in another folder I would prefer to have it compress and change the format while its uploading so as not to use server space, but if this is not the way ffmpeg works, then I dont have a choice.  Any help would be appreciated. p

Unfortunately AVPlayer doesnt seem to support this.p  pAny kind of opensource library or solution in Objective C or C,C would do it, if you could recommend. Even a library that could read the video from the URL and had a function that returned the actual WH pixel data would be of enormous help. In that case the pixels could be uploaded using double PBOs and glTexSubImage2D even if thats not the fastest.p

Positive 519 pI have a media PC Intel NUC that I would like to use both for media projector and work monitors. I have connected two monitors DELL U2410 to mini DisplayPorts and one projector to HDMI. The NUC is running Windows 7 Pro x64. Everything works fine, however when I want to watch a movie on projector via KODI app and switch off the two monitors with buttons, all the open windows from it jump in to projectors view. When those monitors are switched off, MS Windows disables them completely, including desktop space. This is due to feature not bug of DisplayPort being PnP device. One way to solve this would be to use converter cables from mDP to DVI for example, but this particular NUC, probably due to Intel i5 limitation, requires native displayports to work with three monitors if non native DP is used, only two monitors will work. So this is not an option, I have to use native DisplayPort.p  pSo I was attaching this the other way, via software. The idea is to force those two monitors to sleep. I have tried many existing applications and none were able to force them to sleep, and those that did, did not keep them asleep because probably KODI is keeping them alive. So scrap that. Since both monitors support data communication via DDCCI, I have found an example application, written on visual basic C. What I managed to do 1. Read monitors capabilities 2. Power off the selected monitors. Address 0xD6, command 0x04. All desktops remain active and windows stay in their place. Nice. 3. But was unable to bring it back on. Address 0xD6, command 0x01. Monitor does blink a DP symbol in the corner, so it receives the data, but says there is no signal from PC. I am also able to switch inputs, etc., but nothing brings it back up. I can get it back again only by switching monitor off and on via physical button, but that of course makes all my windows to jump around.p  pSo maybe there is a problem with Intel video drivers, for example it stops sending the video data How do I recover from this Is there some other way to achieve what I want, to disable both DP monitors, while leaving HDMI running and all windows to stay in placep  pMaybe other way to solve this issue would be on hardware side, via hotplug pin of DisplayPort According to VESAs standard, it requires a 3.3V signal to detect the monitor. If I permanently connect 3.3V to HotPlug pin, will PC see the monitor as always on, even though there is no live communicationp

Negative 519 pIm new in windows application development using java. The question is this How to i bind events to custom class methodsp  pAs fas i have seen i can register listener classes to swing components to handle events. That is OK but i have to implement a class that implements e.g. the ActionListener interface to handle an event and then implement the actionPerformed method. That means ONE class FOR each event i have  to handlep  pCant i have ONE class listening for events from all components and have each method in this class do the event handlingp  pAn examplep  precodeclass MyEventListener  pseudo code [no constructors, etc]      public void handleSubmitFormBtnEvent e             other methods go here handling events from other swing components  codepre  pNote I am not sure about the method signature but i hope that you get the point.p  pConclusion ONE method to handle events fired from swing components..is it possible Is the creation of ONE class for each the event the only way Cant i route event handling to specific methods for a single classp

Negative 519 pOK, true confession first Maybe its just me, but sometimes best practices for program settings on Windows machines feels like its changed more than Microsofts data access strategies.

Negative 519 pIm writing a program that implements SCVT Spherical Centroidal Voronoi Tesselation.  I start with a set of points distributed over the unit sphere I have an option for random points or an equalarea spiral.  There will be from a several hundred to maybe 64K points.p  pI then need to produce probably several million random sample points, for each sample find the nearest point in the set, and use that to calculate a weight for that point.  This weigh may have to be looked up from another spherical set, but that set will stay static for any given run of the algorithm.p  pThen I move the original points to the calculated points, and iterate the process, probably 10 or 20 times.  This will give me the centers of the Voronoi tiles for subsequent use.p  pLater I will need to find a given points nearest neighbor, to see what tile the user clicked on.  This is trivially solved within the above problem, and doesnt need to be superfast anyway.  The part I need to be efficient is all those millions of nearest neighbors on the unit sphere.  Any pointersp  pOh, Im using x, y, z coordinates, but thats not set in stone.  It just looks like it will simplify things.  Im also using C as Im most familiar with it, but not wedded to that choice either.  p  pIve considered using the spiral pattern for the sample points, as that gives me at least the last points found neighbor as a good starting point for the next search.  But if I do that, it looks like it would make any sort of tree search useless.p  pedit [Im sorry, I thought I was clear with the title and tags.  I can generate random points easily.  The issue is the nearest neighbor search.  Whats an efficient algorithm when all the points are on the unit sphere]p
Negative 519 pI am reading the NOTIFYICONDATA documentation in MSDN.p  pIt says the NOTIFYICONDATA structure has a cbSize member should be set to the size of the structure, but NOTIFYICONDATA structures size has different size in every Shell32.dll, so you should get the Shell32.dll version before setting cbSize.p  pThe following quotes from MSDNp  hr  pIf it is version 5.0 or later, initialize the cbSize member as follows. p  pnid.cbSize  sizeofNOTIFYICONDATAp  pSetting cbSize to this value enables all the version 5.0 and 6.0 enhancements.

Negative 519 pI have tried to create a simple program in different languages C, Java, C, PHP to connect to a server and all behaved in the same way. So I believe this problem is more of a OS level thing.p  pBasically I want the program to connect to the server with a TCP socket and send 1 byte and then close the socket. This needs to done thousands of times per second and sustained over a period of time. This is for the purposes of benchmarking the server. p  pSo far, after a few thousands client sockets, the system comes to a complete halt. It can only start creating sockets after a minute or so of cool down. I have made sure that I have closed each socket after transmission.p  pNow, this kind of problem is familiar with servers like Apache where utilities like absiege are advised to benchmark Apache using the keepalive protocol. I.e., create small number of TCP connections but make multiple requests through them for benchmark purposes. This is however not possible in our case as our proprietary server does not serve HTTP and does not support the HTTP 1.1 keepalive model.p  pSo how can this be achieved I have checked the following limitsp  ol licodeulimitcode is set to a very high numberli licodeTCP TIMEWAITcode is eliminated by setting codeprocsysnetipv4tcprwrecyclecode and codeprocsysnetipv4tcprwreusecode to 1. I have indeed confirmed with codenetstatcode there are no codeTIMEWAITcode socketsli liThis is not related to limits on number of threadsprocesses. I have tried restarting my client app and it is the same. Once the OS refuses new sockets, nothing will help.li ol  pPS. This is strongNOTstrong a server side limitation. We tested this by buying another box and running the same client code on it when the first client box refused to make new sockets. The server handled it fine. We dont want to buy 510 boxes and rotate between them to overcome this problem.p  pOS Fedora 10 Linux 2.6.2423xen 1 SMP p

Negative 519 pSo Ive seen a lot of articles now claiming that on C double checked locking, commonly used to prevent multiple threads from trying to initialize a lazily created singleton, is broken. Normal double checked locking code reads like thisp  precodeclass singleton  private     singleton  private constructor so users must call instance     static boostmutex initmutex  public     static singleton amp instance              static singleton instance          ifinstance                      boostmutexscopedlock lockinitmutex              ifinstance                            instance  new singleton                   return instance       codepre  pThe problem apparently is the line assigning instance  the compiler is free to allocate the object and then assign the pointer to it, OR to set the pointer to where it will be allocated, then allocate it. The latter case breaks the idiom  one thread may allocate the memory and assign the pointer but not run the singletons constructor before it gets put to sleep  then the second thread will see that the instance isnt null and try to return it, even though it hasnt been constructed yet.p  pI a hrefhttpwww.cs.umd.edupughjavamemoryModelDoubleCheckedLocking.html relnofollowsaw a suggestiona to use a thread local boolean and check that instead of codeinstancecode. Something like thisp  precodeclass singleton  private     singleton  private constructor so users must call instance     static boostmutex initmutex     static boostthreadspecificptrltintgt synccheck  public     static singleton amp instance              static singleton instance          ifsynccheck.get                      boostmutexscopedlock lockinitmutex              ifinstance                            instance  new singleton               Any nonnull value would work, were really just using it as a              thread specific bool.             synccheck  reinterpretcastltintgt1                   return instance       codepre  pThis way each thread ends up checking if the instance has been created once, but stops after that, which entails some performance hit but still not nearly so bad as locking every call. But what if we just used a local static boolp  precodeclass singleton  private     singleton  private constructor so users must call instance     static boostmutex initmutex  public     static singleton amp instance              static bool synccheck  false         static singleton instance          ifsynccheck                      boostmutexscopedlock lockinitmutex              ifinstance                            instance  new singleton              synccheck  true                   return instance       codepre  pWhy wouldnt this work Even if synccheck were to be read by one thread when its being assigned in another the garbage value will still be nonzero and thus true. a hrefhttpwww.ddj.comcpp184403766 relnofollowThis Dr. Dobbs articlea claims that you have to lock because youll never win a battle with the compiler over reordering instructions. Which makes me think this must not work for some reason, but I cant figure out why. If the requirements on sequence points are as lose as the Dr. Dobbs article makes me believe, I dont understand why emanyem code after the lock couldnt be reordered to be before the lock. Which would make C multithreading broken period.p  pI guess I could see the compiler being allowed to specifically reorder synccheck to be before the lock because its a local variable and even though its static were not returning a reference or pointer to it  but then this could still be solved by making it a static member effectively global instead.p  pSo will this work or wont it Whyp

If it is in fact too many connections, whats the best approach to deal with itp  pAnd are there any other possible causes that Im not yet considering Basically, theres no predictable way to determine whether or not a users data will be submitted or whether an error will be returned, which is disconcerting from the users perspective, to say the least.p  pa hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions1005485warningmysqlconnectcantconnecttolocalmysqlserverThis questiona is closest to my problem but does not provide a solution to fix my specific issue, hence my posting a new question.p  pThanks in advance for the ideas.p

However, the browser emstill shows the old image.em I have to manually hit the emrefreshem button in the browser to get the new image to display because, obviously, the browser thinks that the image named 1.jpg on this particular page must be the one it has stored.p  pI emdoem use an OutputCache tag with NoStore and Duration1 to try to ensure that nothing on the page is getting cached but to no availp  precodelt OutputCache NoStoretrue Duration1 VaryByParamnone Locationnone gt codepre  pThus the question what do I need to do to ensure that the emnewem image is shown in this scenario  I dont want to rename the images  There are a number of places that count on the image being named after the staff ID.p

Negative 519 pIm having some problem with screen resolutions in Android. p  pI found the problem when I first ran my application on a VGA AVD and the applications images did not occupy the  of the screen I was expecting them to. I tried to run it on HVGA and QVGA and found out that they all occupied the exact same  of the screen, as if the screen resolution was the same.p  pIn fact, resolution was the same I debugged my program and checked the width and height when onSizeChanged was called, and got the same values for all the AVDs 320 x 430, or 320 x 483 for wide resolutions. I created some AVDs and manually set their resolution, but the behavior did not change.p  pMy activitys content view, that is giving me these wrong resolutions, is a class which inherits from View.p

It seems that there is some funny stuff going on in the registers when I checked using the Eclipse Debug facility but I am not too sure what I should be looking for.p  pIf you need the whole code listing, this can be provided. with a particular variable which is not yet initialised in the code being initialised at the precise point that the innerSieve variable hits 32p  pAny help will be greatly appreciated.p
Negative 519 pI have two arrays that I want to resize, but I also want to retain the original values.  The code below resizes the arrays, but the problem is that it overwrites the original values, as you can see when you look at the output from the p  precodeprintx  printy codepre  pcommands at the end of the script.  However, if we comment out the linep  precode NewX,NewYresizex,y,xminMinRR,xmaxMaxRR,yminminLVET,ymaxmaxLVET  codepre  pthen the original values of x and y print out properly.

Negative 519 pIve got a situation where I have several web services that I need to consume. I need the ability to perform custom actions in the constructor of the proxy before any calls are made assigning the configured URL, assigning the SOAP header, etc..p  pMy first solution is to create a child class that derives from the generated proxy, then make those actions in the constructor of the child class. That way, app code can call the constructor of the child, and get a valid proxy that has the stuff I need.p  pIm trying to prevent the app code from calling the constructor of the generated proxy, so people dont accidentally instantiate the proxy without doing my custom stuff. My first thought is to move the generated code into a separate assembly from the child, and make sure the app code only has a reference to the child assembly. This works for the most part, but...p  pThe services contain complex types, defined in the proxy. I need the app code to reference these classes, which means the app code needs a reference to the base assembly anyway, which means they now have access to the generated constructor.p  pIve tried an overlycomplex solution of wrapping each of the generated complex types in an interface, and then hiding the real calls and replacing them with copies of the object as the interface type. This worked once or twice, but it gets ugly really quick.p  pIt seems that the only way I can have everything I want is to remove the public constructor of the generated proxy, and replace it with a protected constructor, then allow a reference to this assembly  theyll be able to work with the complex types, but wont be able to call the constructor. My problem is that the only way I can think of to do this is to manipulate the generated code to change the constructor.p  pAny ideas Im using WSDL.exe to generate the proxies, and theres no option there to hide the constructor. Is there another way that Im just missing I suppose I can write a tool to automatically modify the proxy immediately after its generated, but that just feels ugly to me.p  pThanksp

The app is working, so that when you log in, you get redirected to your subdomain. The problem is that I cant delete the session on both domains. If you log out at username.myapp.com, it stays logged in at myapp.com and vice versa.p  pRight now Im using codesession[userid]  nilcode to delete the session. Is there a way to delete all the sessions across all domains.p  pIn addition, I appended codedomain gt allcode to my codesessionstore.rbcode file so I could stay logged in across multiple subdomains.p

Negative 519 pI have a question very similar to p  pa hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions783944howdoiallocateastdstringonthestackusingglibcsstringimplementationHow do I allocate a stdstring on the stack using glibc39s string implementationap  pbut I think its worth asking again.p  pI want an codestdstringcode with local storage that overflows into the free store. codestdbasicstringcode provides an allocator as a template parameter, so it seems like the thing to do is to write an allocator with local storage and use it to parameterize the codebasicstringcode, like sop  precodestdbasicstringlt char,  stdchartraitsltchargt,  inlineallocatorltchar, 10gt  gt  xtest codepre  pI tried to write the codeinlineallocatorcode class that would work the way youd expect it reserves 10 bytes for storage, and if the codebasicstringcode needs more than 10 bytes, then it calls codeoperator newcode. I couldnt get it to work. In the course of executing the above line of code, my GCC 4.5 standard string library calls the copy constructor for codeinlineallocatorcode 4 times. Its not clear to me that theres a sensible way to write the copy constructor for codeinlineallocatorcode.p  pIn the other StackOverflow thread, Eric Melski provided this link to a class in Chromiump  pa hrefhttpsrc.chromium.orgsvntrunksrcbasestackcontainer.hhttpsrc.chromium.orgsvntrunksrcbasestackcontainer.hap  pwhich is interesting, but its not a dropin replacement for codestdstringcode, because it wraps the codestdbasicstringcode in a container so that you have to call an overloaded codeoperatorgtcode to get at the codestdbasicstringcode.p  pI cant find any other solutions to this problem. Could it be that there is no good solution And if thats true, then are the codestdbasicstringcode and codestdallocatorcode concepts badly flawed I mean, it seems like this should be a very basic and simple use case for codestdbasicstringcode and codestdallocatorcode. I suppose the codestdallocatorcode concept is designed primarily for pools, but I think it ought to cover this as well.p  pIt seems like the rvaluereference move semantics in C0x might make it possible to write codeinlineallocatorcode, if the string library is rewritten so that codebasicstringcode uses the move constructor of its allocator instead of the copy constructor. Does anyone know what the prospect is for that outcomep  pMy application needs to construct a million tiny ASCII strings per second, so I ended up writing my own fixedlength string class based on codeBoost.Arraycode, which works fine, but this is still bothering me.p

Negative 519 pI have what seems like a simple problem, but i have yet to find a solution.  I have a series of divs which may vary in height, thought they will generally be the same width.

The problem is that when the divs are different heights, there ends up being a lot of white space vertically between the elements.p  pClearly, the simple solution is to write some javascript to do all of this for me.  But i would hate to have to resort to that if theres a css solution.p  pHere is a simple examplep  precodelthtml xmlnshttpwww.w3.org1999xhtml gt     ltheadgt         lttitlegtSimple Float Examplelttitlegt          ltstyle typetextcssgt             .dv  border solid 1px red float left width 300px          ltstylegt      ltheadgt     ltbodygt         ltdivgt             ltdiv styleheight 40px classdvgtltdivgt             ltdiv styleheight 20px classdvgtltdivgt             ltdiv styleheight 60px classdvgtltdivgt             ltdiv styleheight 20px classdvgtltdivgt         ltdivgt     ltbodygt lthtmlgt codepre  pYoull see that when the page is very narrow, everything looks as you would expect.

Negative 519 pI would like to use g and emWerrorem, so I have now to disable warnings for 3rdparty libraries I have no control of. The solution provided by a hrefhttpgcc.gnu.orgonlinedocsgccDiagnosticPragmas.htmlhttpgcc.gnu.orgonlinedocsgccDiagnosticPragmas.htmla works very well, allowing simply to wrap the includes of 3rd party headers with pragmas. Unfortunately, that did no longer work for me in a certain setup where templates are involved. I created the following minimal example of where this approach did not work as expectedp  pSource file main.cppp  precodepragma GCC diagnostic ignored Wunusedparameter include hdr.hpp pragma GCC diagnostic error Wunusedparameter int main      return mytemplatefunc2  mystandardfunc3  will print ONLY ONE warning  codepre  pand the header hdr.hppp  precodetemplatelttypename Tgt int mytemplatefuncT t      return 42  int mystandardfuncint i      return 53  codepre  pcompiled using Makefilep  precodeCPPFLAGSWunusedparameter Werror main main.cpp codepre  pwill produce the following compiler errorp  precodeg  Wunusedparameter Werror   main.cpp   o main In file included from main.cpp3 hdr.hpp In instantiation of int mytemplatefuncT [with T  int] main.cpp29   instantiated from here hdr.hpp2 error unused parameter t make  [main] Error 1 shell returned 2 codepre  pNote that explicit instantiation in main.cpp directly after including the header did not work, and wrapping the call to the template function in main.cpp did not work either. What was puzzling that putting codepragma GCC diagnostic ignored Wunusedparametercode in front of the main function silenced the compiler, whilst then adding codepragma GCC diagnostic error Wunusedparametercode at the emvery endem of the file caused the compiler to produce the error again. How to solve this puzzlep  pNote, there are dozens of threads about this pragma, but I could not find anyone that involved such a setupp

And here I go.p  precode gets the list of user names let users  seqltstringgt  ...   maps user name to the SqlConnection let mapUsersToConnections users seqltstringgt  seqltSqlConnectiongt  ...   executes some sql against the given connection and returns some result let mapConnectionToResult conn  seqltstringgt  ...   print the result let print result  unit  ...   and here is the main program users gt mapUsersToConnections gt Seq.map mapConnectionToResult gt Seq.iter print codepre  pBeautiful Elegant Absolutely.p  pstrongButstrong  strongWho and at what point disposes of the SqlConnectionsstrongp  pAnd I dont thing the answer emcodemapConnectionToResultcode should do item is right, because it knows nothing about the lifetime of the connection it is given.

Negative 519 pstrongBackgroundstrongp  pIm working on an application that is supposed to work on every windows platform from XP onwards in the same manner.  Through the .NET framework this has been very easy, for the most part.  The application runs across a variety of touch surfaces.  The application targets .Net 3.0, but if for some reason I should move to .Net 3.5, I can do that.  I am unable to use 4.0.  p  pThe application makes heavy use of GDI through the System.Drawing namespace.  Now, I understand that GDI either isnt hardware accelerated at all or is only accelerated in a very small number of graphics cards, so I expect to have some performance issues.  However, this issue is blaring and makes the applications usability significantly lower.  I would rather not rewrite the entire application to target DirectX or OpenGL if it can be avoided with an easy fix.p  pstrongThe Problemstrongp  pWe recently installed Windows 7 64bit on one of the touch tables.  It was the first time the application was run on a Windows 7 64bit machine.  In any event, any drawing specifically DrawLine with more than one finger on the device at a time causes a ridiculous amount of lag.  This lag isnt apparent on 32bit Windows XP or 32bit Windows 7, so I think it might be specific to 64bit Windows 7 I dont have a 64bit XP machine to test with.p  pThe application was also forced to run as a 32bit application due to one of the .dll files only have 32bit libraries available to compile it.  I read somewhere that forcing a process into 32bit mode on a 64bit system could cause performance issues, but when I upgraded the SDK we were using and made a 64bit specific .dll and application, the problem persisted.p  pI read a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions4851192x64applicationsusinggdiwhataretheconsequencesonperformanceon this other StackOverflow threada that there should be no differences between a 32bit and a 64bit application with relation to GDI.  This doesnt seem to be the case here.  p  pSo what it comes down to  Do any of you know why there might be such a huge performance difference between Windows 32bit and Windows 64bit  If I cant find a solution, Ill have to spend a bit of time making everything use hardware accelerated drawing.  I would like to avoid that if at all possible.p  pThanks everyonep  pstrongEDIT  Requested code snippetstrongp  precode    public delegate void drawLineDelegateColor color, float width, int x1, int y1, int x2, int y2     public void drawLineColor color, float width, int x1, int y1, int x2, int y2              if InvokeRequired                      Invokenew drawLineDelegatedrawLine, new object[]  color, width, x1, y1, x2, y2                   else                      try                              lock drawLock                                      pen.Width  width                     pen.Color  color                     scaledPen.Width  width  this.Width  Canvas.Width                     scaledPen.Color  color                     Point p1  scalePointToScreennew Pointx1, y1                     Point p2  scalePointToScreennew Pointx2, y2                      graphics.DrawLinepen, x1, y1, x2, y2                     scaledGraphics.DrawLinescaledPen, p1.X, p1.Y, p2.X, p2.Y                      this.Invalidatenew RectangleMath.Minp1.X, p2.X  intscaledPen.Width, Math.Minp1.Y, p2.Y  intscaledPen.Width,                           Math.Absp2.X  p1.X  2  intscaledPen.Width, Math.Absp2.Y  p1.Y  2  intscaledPen.Width                                           catch Exception ex                              if Scribbler.Properties.Settings.Default.LogLevel gt 2                                      Scribbler.ScribblerForm.WriteLogMessageex.ToString                                        codepre  pstrongEdit Further Researchstrong I did some more scouring of the internet with relation to the NVidia cards we use on our machines.  This lead me to several posts on the NVidia Developer Forums about people with the same issue.  The common answer is that GDI is deprecated on Windows 7 and the newer NVidia graphics drivers from 182.5 onwards suffer from GDI performance issues.  The solutions were either to update to Direct3D or use old drivers.  Does anyone know for certain whether this is the best course of actionp

This is so when the user changes the country settings, the state list can be filtered in the model view. The problem is that when the form loads some previous information, the state combo box is blank even through it has data. It seems to be because of the order in they are placed in the xaml.

Negative 519 pIs it a good practice using global variables in a VB .NET application in order to exchange data between formsp  pAs global variable I mean a public variable defined in a module and not a public member or property of a class. Moreover as my personal rule I never access a global variable from a class, but I pass the values to the class via functions.p  pI know, I am not a friend a global variables and their abuse, but there are some cases in forms data exchange where they seem to be to only way to make simpleclear code.p  pExample 1  my application is started with command line args. I need to access to this arguments in all my forms i just read and validate the arguments in my MDIload event and then store them in  global variables. Thus I can read these values in a very simply way from all my forms.p  pExample 2 Im developing a program that write applications events in a EventLog protocol like the Windows EventLog. I wrote the class EventLog that handles adding, showing, saving, sorting the EventLog. Then I put in a module the global variable stronggEventLogstrong as istance of the class EventLog and created the object when the MDI form is loaded. In this way I have a global variable and I can handle the EventLog from each forms MDI and child in my program. On the other hand I could have created  EventLog as public member or property of my MDI form and it would have been the same.p  pI found and read already some discussions, but more tailored on C programming or basic discussion issues, like inp  pa hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions484635areglobalvariablesbadAre global variables badap  pa hrefhttpc2.comcgiwikiGlobalVariablesAreBad relnofollowhttpc2.comcgiwikiGlobalVariablesAreBadap  pand on vb thisp  pa hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions4529862declareglobalvariblesinvb2010Declare global varibles in VB 2010ap  pAny suggestions about the particular case of data exchange between forms and not between classes and other components of the program Thank you.p

Negative 519 pI have an app where I have 5 sets of animations that Im storing in an array. The animations get picked to play randomly after a button touch. This is all working perfectly, however I noticed a bug when I quit the app and reopen immediately, Ill see my main view, then itll jump to my second view that has the animation in it. This shouldnt happen since you have to tap the main view in order for it to modally swap in the second view. If I interact with it everything works for a few seconds, then it closes with no crash log.p  pI finally realized that some of the objects must not be getting released fast enough, since if I close the app and wait three seconds, then reopen, everything executes fine.p  pI didnt want to put down code to show as this is more of a brainstorming question.

In order to send the inputs, since they could be different types or even new userdefined types, I could use an array of object...p  pSome tasks may depend on other tasks, ie, as input parameters may have at least one output of another task, and so I would need to implement also the link between the output of a task and the input of another.p  pHow should I proceed to define the classp
Negative 519 pI am developing an application for internal use in our company. The purpose of this application is for document imaging. What we are wanting to do is print a barcode label to attach to documents so that when they are scanned in a piece of software such as vfiler will be able to read the barcodes and know how to file them. p  pThe main focus is our ERP system which is web based PHP. We are wanting to modify the code to allow the user to print the barcode label immediately once they enter an order or PO. I have access to the source code for the ERP web pages. I dont know of any way to make a web page print to a printer without displaying the printer select dialog. So, I decided that I wanted to try and create a VB application that would do the printing of the barcodes. This would allow me to bypass the the printer select dialog. p  pNow for the question. Is there any way to have a web page PHP running on the server call a VB app to perform a task So, if I had a button on the webpage and the user clicked it, that button would somehow send the pertinent information Order number to the VB app and the VB app would print the barcode. The VB app will always be running on the machine. The label printers will be Zebra USB label printers on each persons machine.p  pAny thoughts appreciated.p  pThanks, Keithp

Negative 519 pIve been on this issue for probably a good two months now and really havent found a stable solution so I thought Id just try to ask. I have an existing site already at a hrefhttpkeyjaycompound.com relnofollowhttpkeyjaycompound.coma that runs off a CMS that I designed. While it was good at the time, Ive now outgrown it and looking at it now, looks sloppy XD. p  pSo at first I started redoing the CMS when I thought and read that there are so many CMS solutions available, why spin my wheels It seemed more logical to get a third party solution that does the mondain tasks like article CRUD and user management where Id primarily worry about the addons.p  pSo I searched and tried many solutions that I thought would suite my PHP development needs. As my testing base, I needed to see how well my current site would transfer over and how much hassle would ensue. While CMSs like Drupal, E107, and others were great....on paper, neither seem to suite my need. They were either too bloated, lacking in documentation or community support, seemly comprised of large hassle for simple tasks, or just downright confusing lt.p  pSo now the road has put me at Frameworks now in which Im currently trying to learn Code Igniter. Now my issue becomes security One of the advantages of CMS systems like Drupal or Joomla is that they have and constantly are field tested for security holes. Something a lone modest experienced developer like myself would probably never find. However what some have told me is that the fact that the CMS would be designed by me does create somewhat of a layer of security considering its not common to the public as much as Drupal or Wordpress.p  pSo with that here are my questions. In consideration of time and practicalityp  ol lihow do pros actually do something like this select a content management system for their projectli liDo they start with frameworks and build out, adjusting to security problems along the wayli liDo they use a particular CMS solution so they dont worry as much about common security holesli liMaybe I should start with a framework like Codeigniter and growing with it as my security and user management needs change li ol  pThanks guys. Id really like to finally stick with a solution to learn so I can finally get back to developing.p

Negative 519 pA part of the source code for a project Im working on, which is responsible for compressing a sequence of events, looks like thisp  precodeinclude ltiteratorgt include ltlistgt  typedef int Event  typedef stdlistltEventgt EventList  struct Compressor       Returns an iterator behind the last element which was eaten     virtual EventListconstiterator eatEvents const EventList ampl   0    Plenty of Compressor subclasses exist  void compressAndCopyEatenEvents Compressor ampc       EventList e     e.pushback 1      EventListconstiterator newEnd  c.eatEvents e       EventList eatenEvents     stdcopy e.begin, newEnd, stdbackinserter eatenEvents    barfs  codepre  pThe issue here is that the codecompressAndCopyEatenEventscode function has a nonconst list of events this list os passed to the codeeatEventscode methods, which takes a referencetoconst and yields a codeconstiteratorcode. Now the codecompressAndCopyEatenEvenstcode function would like to copy the range of eaten events away, so it decides to use some algorithm codestdcopycode here, which of course could just as well be replaced with the right codestdlistcode constructor call  the point is that this problem exists with all kinds of ranges.p  pUnfortunately many if not all ranges need to be composed from the same iterator type. However, in the above code, e.begin yields an codeEventListiteratorcode because the object is not const but newEnd is an codeEventListconstiteratorcode.p  pIs there a design weakness here which causes this mess How would you tackle itp

Negative 519 pI have an activeMQ broker using an SSL transport. I have about 10 consumers that are using the broker. I am using camel to configure my routes. p  pEvery so often, it hangs up and will not consume new messages, even if I restart the consumers, even though there are messages pending in the queues.p  pI started trying to isolate where this was happening by stepping through my consumers one at a time trying to replicate the problem. I finally got to a consumer that I could recreate the problem on. It will hang after a period of time, however, if I go to the active MQ admin console and try to view messages in the queue, it will start running again. I think that Jetty is causing a connection to happen to refresh the queue for the webpage, and thus unblocking some thread problem I am having. How should I debug thisp  pThanksp

However, it provides  the adapter a hrefhttpsgithub.commakerlabsPagerBundleblobmasterAdapterDoctrineOrmAdapter.php relnofollowDoctrineOrmAdaptera for Doctrine2 based on codeQueryBuildercode.p  pThen, one should create a specific query with the codeQueryBuildercode inside each controller. This approach will bring to the need of defining emad hocem functions that can be used inside the controllers, as well as possible problem when the table schema change.

I will provide 3 examples of code to clarify my self Suppose, we have bean HelloWorld with method codeprintHellocode and bean HelloFacade with method codesayHellocode that forward calls to HelloWorlds method codeprintHellocode.p  pFirst example is using Springs context and without custom runner, using ReflectionTestUtils for dependency injection DIp  precodepublic class Hello1Test   private ApplicationContext ctx  Before public void setUp      MockitoAnnotations.initMocksthis     this.ctx  new ClassPathXmlApplicationContextMETAINFspringServicesImplContext.xml     Test public void testHelloFacade      HelloFacade obj  HelloFacade ctx.getBeanHelloFacadeImpl.class     HelloWorld mock  mockHelloWorld.class     doNothing.whenmock.printHello      ReflectionTestUtils.setFieldobj, hello, mock     obj.sayHello      verifymock, times1.printHello    codepre  pAs Noam pointed out thereis way to run it wihtout explicit call to codeMockitoAnnotations.initMocksthiscode.

In the last example, we can just declare HelloFacadeImpl and Mokito will instantiate it for us. The drawback of this approach that now, unitundertest is implclass and not interface.p

Negative 519 pSo basically, at the moment, we are trying to write a basic HTML 5 page that, when you press a button, returns whether the user, on Steam, is ingame, offline, or online. We have looked at the Steam API, and to find this information, it requires the persons 64 bit ID steamID64 and we, on the website, are only given the username. In order to find their 64 bit id, we have tried to scrape off of a website codesteamidconverter.comcode to get the users 64 bit id from their username. We tried doing this through the javascript, but of course we ran into the cross domain block, not allowing us to access that data from our google App Engine website.p  pI have experience in Python, so I attempted to figure out how to get the HTML from that website in the form of codesteamidconverter.compersonsusernamecode with Python. That was a success in scraping, thanks to another post on Stack Overflow.p  pBUT, I have no idea how to get that data back to the javascript and get it to do the rest of the work. I am stumped and really need help. This is all on google App Engine. All it is at the moment, is a button that runs a simple javascript that attempts to use JQuery to get the contents of the page back, but fails. I dont know how to integrate the twop  pPlease Helpp

Negative 519 pIm trying to create a card game for the Android platform, which will be played over the network, one turn at a time. I am hoping to use Google App Engine for my server backend, and Google Cloud Messaging to notify players when its their turn. My idea approach this implementation is to have users login through the Facebook APIs, store the facebook user id and then register the app with Google Cloud Messaging and store the Registration ID. Then both the facebook and GCM ids would be submitted to the server and stored in the GAE datastore. To generate a list of friends to start a new game with, would I just use the facebook Open Graph API to get a list of the users friends ids and then compare each of the facebook ids stored on the server to the list of facebook friends Or is there a better way to get a list of facebook friends who also have the app installed p  pAfter each turn, the android app would serialize a game object and upload it to the GAE, which would then use the saved Registration id to notify the other players. When the app opens on a device, it would download the serialized game objects pending on the server, and inflate it and proceed with the next turn. This is my first attempt at programming anything more complicated than a simple website with a little JavaScript. Any help or direction would be appreciated.p

I dont want the users to do anything other than run my program on my equipment.p  pHow can I lock the users into only using my program for the life of the tabletp  pI am building a system that happens to use an Android tablet to control it.

Negative 519 pIm using JavaScriptJQuery to update the content of a div that is scrollable horizontally.  I need to avoid updating the content while the user is scrolling.  In a normal browser, this is easy as the onscroll event tells me when the user has finished.p  pUnfortunately, it isnt so easy on an iPad. There are 2 scenarios on the iPadp  ol liThe user scrolls slowly and releases their finger  here a touchend event will fire and thats it.li liThe user scrolls quickly and releases their finger midswipe  here a touchend will fire when they lift their finger, but the device will continue scrolling for a second or two using the momentum of the swipe.  Once its stopped, a scroll event will fire.li ol  pThe problem is, theres no way of knowing that scenario 2 is happening.  A touchend event happens in both cases and theres no way of knowing that a scroll event will be fired, other than waiting to see if it does.p  pTo make it worse, the iPad only updates the scrollLeft property of the div AFTER the scrolling has finished in either scenario.  So I cant check periodically to see if scrollLeft is still changing.p  pSo how can I know that the div content has finished scrollingp

Negative 519 pIve been using codeqmakecode and codeCMakecode in the past without any problem to generate my makefiles. However, recently I figured on some of the clusters I run my codes these tools are harder to findinstall so Ive decided writing bare Makefiles. Besides I could also learn a thing or two about Makefiles p  pMy project involves several directories with sourceheader files inside and most often cross dependencies between them. Ive learned, through SO, to use codeMMcode flag to automatically generate dependency information. My Makefiles look like thisp  precodeinclude HEADDIRcommon.mk  OBJSDIR  objs LIBSDIR  libs  SRCS   Matrix.cpp MatrixFull.cpp OBJS   patsubst ,OBJSDIR,SRCS.cpp.o LIB0  patsubst , LIBSDIR,libalgebra.a  DEPS  patsubst ,OBJSDIR,SRCS.cpp.d include DEPS  .PHONY all all         echo     Building dependencies in libalgebra       MKDIR OBJSDIR     MAKE  OBJS     MKDIR LIBSDIR     MAKE  LIB0     echo     done    OBJSDIR.o .cpp     echo  compiling source file   lt ...     CXX c CXXFLAGS IINCLUDEPATH MM lt o   LIB0 OBJSDIR.o     echo  generating library file F ...     AR ARFLAGS    .PHONY clean clean     RM OBJSDIR LIBSDIR codepre  pThis generally works fine but Id like to improve on couple of things 1 When I change a header file and I issue codemakecode, somehow the compiler does not pick codeallcode  and seems to default to codeDEPScode. Is this supposed to happen in this makefile How can I make codeallcode the default rule 2 How can I make depenency files invisible I tried codeDEPS  patsubst ,OBJSDIR.,SRCS.cpp.dcode but that did not help 3 Is there any specific suggestion you could give me if you think this Makefile could be improved in any other wayp  pemEDITem To be honest, Im not even sure how make invokes the compiler to generate dependencies p ... I do not see any explicit rule for this. Is it somehow hidden in codeDEPS  patsubst ,OBJSDIR,SRCS.cpp.dcode p

Negative 519 pIm getting a very strange crash when testing an existing application in Windows 8. The main application is written in Delphi XE Win32 and it does some calls to .Net assemblies using COM interop. The current .Net version being used is 3.5.p  pWhen the application executes on a fresh install of Windows 8, it crashes up to 10 times before it suddenly starts to run properly. Once it has started to do OK it will continue to do so. No error logs or error messages are shown. The application just hangs or stops working. p  pI have had the same result on 4 different Win8 installations, both physical and virtual.p  pI have been able to do some remote debugging and managed to track down the error to the .Net method codeDouble.TryParsecode, when trying to parse a nonnumeric value. p  pcodeDouble.Parsecode within a TryCatch block does not work either.p  pThe main assemblies are written in Delphi Prism, but I have been able to reproduce the error with test assemblies written in C using VS2010.p  p.Net 4 seems to work properly, but due to the missing support for Oracle were not able to upgrade right now.p  pThe program works OK on previous versions of Windows, and also on Windows Server 2012.p  pAny hints or suggestions would be really appreciated.p  pemAdditionem I forgot to mention the test assembly works properly when being called from another test application written in C  managed code.

But there I face two problemsp  ol lino log will be persisted if the request cant be processedli lithe request wont be processed if the log cant be updated unlikely but yet possibleli ol  pSo the other idea is to create and update the log with regular JDBC transactions. Only the entitymanagers for the request transactions would join the user transactions and the entity managers for creating and updating the log would commit directly. p  pIs it possible to mix JTA and JPA on a single persistence unit Or do we already have patterns for those kinds of JMS and JDBC transactionsp

Negative 519 pIm starting to think about how to solve the problem of developing an app for all iOS devices with different screens resolution, ratio, retina, etc. Im working with Adobe Air AS3, but that really doesnt matter because Im in a conceptual phase and Im concerned about the patterns to use.p  pIf I was only developing for iPad, the problem would be as simple as doubling measures and sizes to adapto to retina and nonretina devices. But I need to take into account iPhones, iPods, and eventually Android too with its myriad of screens.p  pSo far I see those possible options. Im sorry if theres already some terminology for those options, but Ill just say in it my own words.p  ul lipIntelligent views that have some sort of liquid layout, and also intelligent components that adapt to the space the view is assigning to them, and to the screen dpi for font sizes, and image sizes. For example the view says here goes a button on the bottom with this widthheight. The button already knows what font size the text must be depending on the screen dpi.pli lipFactorization with parameters of different UI view classes. So Id have one view class for iPad, another for iPhone, etc. and there would be one class that would factorize the instantiation of the view depending on the device. Each of those classes could be hand tailored to be completely different from each other, but the underlying model and hopefully the controller would be the same on every device.pli lipA middle way approach One UI View class for tablets, another for phones, and each of those with some sort of liquid capacity to fine tune the position and size of elements buttons, texts, images, etc.pli lipExternal config files that give the View some parameters depending on the device.

Negative 519 pFellow SO users,p  pIm hoping someone can share their ideas on how to go about doing this problem. Lets say, I have a table of values. The table contains two columns, the first col COL1 has a  specific value associated with it and the second column COL2 has another valuep  pThe values are all in hexadecimalp  precodeCOL1    COL2  0       11  1       90  2       52  3       C8  4       B7 codepre  pNow, what I have to do is, compare the value in one of the registers and if it matches any value from COL1, I have to load another register with the corresponding value from COL2. For example, if I have a value, say, R2  1, I will have to load R3 with 90.p  pThe approach that Im using involves completely avoiding the codelbcode instruction which Im aiming forp  precodeand r1, r1, r0    Initialise r1 to 0 addi r1, r1, 1     load r1 with 1 beq r2, r1, LOAD1 Check to see if r2  1  and r1, r1, r0 addi r1, r1, 2 beq r2, r1, LOAD2  LOAD1  and r3, r3, zero addi r3, r3, 0x52  Load r3 with 0x52 as per the table  LOAD2 Load value into r3 as before. codepre  pThe issue with this is, it will get ridiculously long if I have a huge table. Could someone please suggest a shorter way, if there exists one with using the codelbcode operatorp

Negative 519 pLately Ive been writing some objects wherein the behavior of one method sometimes consists of calling another one of its own methods under certain conditions. To test this, Ive been mocking the methods the object calls on itself as it makes it easier to cover each branch in the code without combinatorial explosion. This is generally considered bad practice. But heres an example which almost exactly mirrors a piece of code Im working on now written in CoffeeScript but this philosophical issue has come up for me before in other languages too.p  precodeclass UserDataFetcher   constructor dataSource gt    fetchUsernameAsync gt      ... snip ... Hits API and raises any errors    fetchUserCommentsAsync gt      ... snip ... Hits API and raises any errors    fetchUsernameAndUserCommentsAsync gt      ... snip ... Calls each of the above in order and handles errors specially codepre  pThis is pretty straightforward. codefetchUsernameAsynccode and codefetchUserCommentsAsynccode each interact with the given codedataSourcecode to fetch the data. Then we have codefetchUsernameAndUserCommentsAsynccode which is essentially a composed method calling the other two and handling them in a certain way in this example, it might want to reraise any errors resulting from codefetchUsernameAsynccode but swallow any errors raised by codefetchUserCommentsAsynccode.p  pTesting the behavior of the first two methods is trivial I mock out their respective calls to codedataSourcecode and assert that they return the data in the correct format or allow any errors to be raised. Testing the behavior of the last method is where I have my dilemma.p  pIts still a simple method with minimal branching logic and delegating most of the work by passing messages. Normally I would test its behavior by mocking out its collaborators and asserting on certain messages being passed and returning the data in the appropriate format or failing correctly. But the difference here is that it has just one collaborator, codethiscode. I would be mocking some methods of the object under test, which is considered bad practice.p  pObviously a way around this would be to move this method to a different object it would be an object with exactly one method and almost exactly the same mechanics, and it would allow me to mock out its collaborator without violating the dont mock methods on the object under test rule. It would probably have a ridiculous name like codeUsernameAndCommentsFetchercode, and I would go from having one small class to two tiny, almost microscopic classes. Small classes are good, but this level of granularity might be a little overkill, and in this case would only exist to satisfy the dont mock methods on the object under test rule.p  pIs this a solid rule or are there cases, such as this, where its reasonable to bend the rulep  pNote I realize this is similar to this question, but I think the example is different enough to warrant another look a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions184729asamockisttddpractitionershouldimockothermethodsinthesameclassaAs a quotmockistquot TDD practitioner, should I mock other methods in the same class as the method under testap

Negative 519 pI am needing some help with AES encryptiondecryption in C. Specifically, I want to generate an IV with RijndaelManaged, convert it to text, and store the IV with the encrypted text in the database. I want to append the IV to the beginning of the encrypted data so I can remove it and use it for decryption functions.p  pHere is where my confusion is... The IV generated by RijndaelManaged is a byte array, 16 bytes long. So Im thinking that the IV should be 16 characters long when converted to text but thats not whats happening.p  pThe IV is 16 bytes in length, but when I convert those 16 bytes to text, it is 24 characters long. Is that normal somehow Is that going to happen every time If so then I will just take the first 24 characters of the encrypted text as the IV for decryption instead of the first 16 character but that creates another error as described below.

Negative 519 pI have made a mistake when designing my DB. I have created a table with more than 40 text cells. Now I have a nearly finished application cakePHP and I recognized that InnoDB tables have these limitations the first time while testing with larger data...p  pI read tons of forum threads and websites and all I find is the limit of InnoDB and that one solution of this can be using MyIsam tables.

Can anybody answer me thatp  pI think I know most about the other differences between those two and I think dont need the features of InnoDB. I am only searching for an easy way to solve my problem of the rowsizes...p  pMy second question If I have to split my table in 46 tables vertical partitioning with less columns, does anybody know if cakePHP has a good way in dealing with this Logically it should be one datastorage. Every SELECT statement has to fetch all the data from all the split tables. The tables will all have a 1to1relation.p

The light on the Zebra printer for data lights up but nothing will print. I have tried this with two of the Zebra printers we own, so it is not a printer issue. My guess at this point is that maybe the program isnt sending the entire label data to the printer and the end is never received but when i trace through the send request, everthing is sent properly. the printer also shows the job has 00 pages for the label but i cannot understand why it is not sending the label. Is there something special that needs to go at the end of the label data besides the XZ termination character I am also using Delphi XE3 if that helps.p

Negative 519 pI am implementing REST through RESTlet. This is an amazing framework to build such a restful web service it is easy to learn, its syntax is compact. However, usually, I found that when somebodysomeprogram want to access some resource, it takes time to printoutput the XML, I use JaxbRepresentation. Lets see my codep  precodeOverride Get public Representation toXml throws IOException      if this.requireAuthentication          if this.app.authenticategetRequest, getResponse                        return new EmptyRepresentation                     check if the representation already tried to be requested before     and therefore the data has been in cache     Object dataInCache  this.app.getCachedData.getgetURI     if dataInCache  null          System.out.printlnRepresenting from Cache         this is warning. unless we can check that dataInCache is of type T, we can         get rid of this warning         this.dataToBeRepresented  TdataInCache      else          System.out.printlnNOT IN CACHE         this.dataToBeRepresented  whenDataIsNotInCache         automatically add data to cache         this.app.getCachedData.putgetURI, this.dataToBeRepresented, cachedduration           now represent it if not previously execute the EmptyRepresentation     JaxbRepresentationltTgt jaxb  new JaxbRepresentationltTgtdataToBeRepresented     jaxb.setFormattedOutputtrue     return jaxb  codepre  pAS you can see, and you might asked me yes I am implementing Cache through KittyCache. So, if some XML that is expensive to produce, and really looks like will never change for 7 decades, then I will use cache... I also use it for likely static data. Maximum time limit for a cache is an hour to remain in memory.p  pEven when I cache the output, sometimes, output are irresponsive, like hang, printed partially, and takes time before it prints the remaining document. The XML document is accessible through browser and also program, it used GET.p  pWhat are actually the problem I humbly would like to know also the answer from RESTlet developer, if possible. Thanksp

Negative 519 pIm still fighting with memory leak. Using improved MemoryDiagnosticsHelper, i added possibility to make datastamps to see immediate memory cunsumption.p  pProblem starts at full app i have a pivot with 3 items, 2 of them containing list of 1020 objects with possibility to jump to item details. Memory diagnostic shows, that it consumes about 50Mb of memory. After jumping to detail page and returning to pivot, memory consumption easily grows to 70Mb.p  pAt first, i moved list to separate app. Without style, it takes 15 Mbs. I didnt check yet, but i assume, 2 lists in pivot would take about 20Mbs, because dlls are already loaded.p  pSo, i decided to go deeper into app loading stage. p  ul liAt the InitializePhoneApplication, it takes 7 Mb.li liAt the CompleteInitializePhoneApplication, it takes 8.5 Mb with empty ViewModelLocator, or 10.5 Mb with all viewmodels. Quite large, but i have 3040 dataservices and 4050 viewmodels. So let it be, id feel myself pretty ok, if it would not grow anymore.li liAt the first pages OnNavigatedTo, it takes almost the same, kinda 10.7 Mb with all VMs, thats ok.li lili liemNo profit.em Seriously, what happens next I cant see, what exactly is going on next, but MemoryDiagnosticsHelper says, that memory consumption jumps to 30 Mbs. Why All dlls and VMs are already loaded. Im just loading a very empty page, totally white.li ul  pProfiler running in release mode, of course, is also helpless. It just shows growth in memory consumption, but it happens in nonmanaged memory.

Negative 519 pIm a student programmer and Ive landed a task at my job to develop a software system to monitor when employees clock in, clock out, and log the times. The employees will use a keypad attached to a computer at the front desk to enter their employee id into a gui which will clock them inout. Theres another gui the office manager will use to monitor employee in and outs, and keep track of whos in the office. p  pThe project is a windows form project in VS 2010, with two guis as mentioned, and an Access 2007 database to store the data. The office manager gui has a DataGridView object that Id like to populate with the employee name, and time she clocks in or out. I would like for this to happen in real time. In other words, once the employee clocks in, it populates in the office managers gui. What Im looking for is the best practice to this approach. Should I take a clientserver approach Should I have something trigger from the  database to alert the office manager gui to fire an event to get the clock inout time of the employee populated into the office managers DataGridViewp  pThe database and queries have all been designed. Im just looking for the best practice to approach this problem. Im a junior level college student and I come to stackoverflow.com all the time. This is my first question, so either way this is a big step for me  Thanks in advance.p

Negative 519 pI just purchased a MacBook air and for some reason whenever Im testing a project locally on MAMP Im forced to refresh the page about 6 or 7 times for the changes that Ive made in the text editor to be reflected in the browser.

These problems happen both with backend and front end code. Its very strange it makes the task of local development very very difficult and time consuming. Any ideasp
Negative 519 pI have an application where I need to create files with a unique and sequential number as part of the file name. My first thought was to use since this application does not have any other data storage a text file that would contain a number and I would increment this number so then my application would always create a file with a unique id.  Then I thought that maybe at a time when there are more than one user submitting to this application at the same time, one process might be reading the txt file before it has been written by the previous process. So then I am looking for a way to read and write to a file with try catch so then I can know when its being used by another process and then wait and try to read from it a few other times in the same process without unlocking the file in between. If what I am saying above sounds like a bad option, could you please give me an alternative to this How would you then keep track of unique identification numbers for an application like my casep  pThanks.p

Negative 519 pI was writing a method for a doubley linked list data structure that is supposed to reverse a list of elements from index a to b, as specified in the parameters, and decided to do it recursively. The objective of the assignment was to practice pointer manipulation using nodes. The logic for my method seemed okay to me, but when I ran the code through a JUnit test it wouldnt end. Thinking this was strange, I added println statements to see which parts of the code it reached everything checked out okay.

Negative 519 pI am trying to move a website into Azure Azure Website. I have everything moved, except the ssl isnt working. The error that comes up saysp  pcodeYou attempted to reach [subdomain].[domain].com, but instead you actually reached a server identifying itself as .azurewebsites.net ...codep  pI think it may have something to do with my certificate. The cert is a UCC cert multiple SAN through GoDaddy. I did not rekey the cert when I moved the site from the old server to the Azure Website. The old server was managed using Parallels. Here is what I did to move the certp  pI logged into Parallels on the old server. I opened the SSL screen, where I could see the 4 parts of the cert csr, private key, certificate, CA certificate. I copied the text for each of those including the codeBegin Certificatecode and codeEnd Certificatecode lines.  EDIT the private key began with codeBegin RSA Private Keycode and ended with codeEnd RSA Private keycode, and I pasted the data to create 4 .txt files. I then renamed the txt files so that I had 4 files named codeCAcertificate.cercode, codecertificate.cercode, codeprivateKey.pemcode, and codecert.cercode. They were all saved in the c directory root.p  pI then pulled up OpenSSL and ran the following commandp  pcodepkcs12 export in ccertificate.cer inkey cprivateKey.pem out ccertificate.pfx certfile cCAcertificate.cercodep  pI entered a password twice, and out popped a certificate.pfx file.p  pI uploaded that file to my Azure Website. The UCC Cert applies to 4 subdomains. I have my Azure Website set up with only one of those subdomains as a domain name. After uploading the file, I went to codeSSL Bindingcode, and chose that subdomain, matched it with the cert I just uploaded, and chose SNI SSL. I saved it, and all looked good.p  pUnfortunately, when I browse to the subdomain, I get the error I listed at the beginning.p  pI have a CName set up to forward from that subdomain to the Azure Website. I also have an A record set up to point from that subdomain to the IP Address of the Azure Website. The site is pulling up as I would expect, except for the ssl certificate error.p  pDid I generate the .pfx file incorrectly Is there something I need to change in Azure or my domain registrar I noticed that I could download a .pem file from the parallels panel. It contained all 4 parts of the cert in one file. I didnt know what I could do with that.p

I annotated my code with coments to explain everything.p  pThe approach I took is as follow p  pfirst of all, the codelexingcode part, which is simply done with Regex and this returns a codeToken listcodesee type codeTokencode below. p  psecond implement a function that takes a Token list and evaluates everything see function codeevalExprcode below with exception that this expression codeToken listcode is not nested with any parantheses.p  pthen as I mentioned in my a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions19941084applyingrecursionon1dlistwithparenthesesquistiona on how to solve the nested parenthses problem, I couldnt implement a strongemgoodemstrong function to that, as I have a 1D list of Token, I found it hard to transform it to a Tree and eval it in a subsequential way so I did the following see the clumsy codeunnest2code function below p  pI try to find the most nested expresion between parentheses and evaluate it to a Token of Digit value see Token type  Digit then have another function that keeps unnesting the most nested expression till there are no parentheses.p  pI was testing the function alot with F Interactive and made changes to function till I got what I wantedp  pSo my program now can do this  552  4  534  57  12 yeeessss, it worked p  pbut then when i tested is on this 453  43  43  7  Note that how the 5 between two Open parentheses is being ignored on the unnesting phase p  pSo I need your help guys to find out whats wrong in the codeunnest2code function.p  pNote that im a beginner with F, so excuse me for my way of trying to solve this, as I have a C background.p  pNOTE A lot of you told me that i need to use the Shuntingyard algorithm, I didnt like it much, i would like to use my own algorithm to solve thisp  precodeopen

Negative 519 pRecently one SSL certificate has been removed from IIS but still available in Trusted Root when I open it via MMC. The cert seems dose not have a private key so when I export it again from mmc it creates a CRE file instead of PFX. Now how I can reinstall again the cert type .cer from trusted root to ISS to make the HTTPS works again. I am not sure I  can access the physical path of the certificates which are in trusted root and add them again.  p

Negative 519 pIm using angularJS to ngRepeat over a number of search results in order to display them in a table. Each result consists of a number of table rows and columns, so the ngRepeat is repeating a codetbodycode container to encompass a full result.p  pThe issue Im having is in styling a border around each codetbodycode. Each border is to transition from transparent to a specified color on mouseover, however the edges of the borders appear overlapped due to the default codebordercollapse collapsecode property, which makes them appear cutoff, and generally broken. I can make the border appear correct if I use codebordercollapse separatecode and codedisplay blockcode, but I lose the nice horizontal spacing of columns that the table would normally provide.p  pMy goal is for each codetbodycode to have its own border so I can transition the color on mouseover, while maintaining proper horizontal spacing with respect to the codethcode tags that are displayed at the top of the table.p  pHere is a simplified version of what I havep  pHTMLp  precodelttablegt lttheadgt     ltthgtHeading 1ltthgt     ltthgtHeading 2ltthgt     ltthgtHeading 3ltthgt lttheadgt lttbody ngrepeatresult in resultsgt     lttrgt         lttdgtresult.alttdgt         lttdgtresult.blttdgt         lttdgtresult.clttdgt     lttrgt     lttrgt         lttd colspan3gt         ltdivgtresult.dltdivgt         lttdgt     lttrgt lttbodygt codepre  pp  pCSSp  precodetbody    transition bordercolor 0.6s ease   webkittransition bordercolor 0.6s ease  Safari    border 4px solid black   tbodyhover    bordercolor red  codepre  pIve consulted a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions18989958tbodybordernotshowingtbody border not showinga,  a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions6712946addbordersontbodyAdd borders on lttbodygta,  a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions6265123bordertopfromtbodyandborderbottomfromtheaddontworkatthesametimeBordertop from tbody and borderbottom from thead don39t work at the same timea amongst others..p  pThanks in advance.p

Ive been able to crop out a region in the image where it must have a fingertip, and extract the edges using Canny Edge Detector. However Im stuck. Since my project description says I cant use the skin color for detection, I cannot find the exact contour of the finger, and will have to try to separate the fingertip with edges alone. Right now Im thinking since the finger has a curved arch shapeletter U shape, maybe that could be used for detection. But since it has to be rotationscale invariant, most algorithms I found so far are not up to it. Does anyone have an idea of how to do this Thanks for anyone that responds img srchttpi.stack.imgur.comX5wbI.png altenter image description herep  pThis is the result I have now. I want to put a bounding box around the index fingertip, or the highest fingertip, whichever is the easiest.p

Negative 519 pIve been reading a lot about Entity Frameworks and now I want to implement it on my game. An Entity Framework is based on making the game entities simple containers of Components, where a Component contains a certain characteristic of an Entity and all the variablesaccessors which describe this characteristic. The game logic is then modularized by creating Systems. Each System implements and runs a certain aspect of the game logic eg. Collisions, Rendering, Animation. Each System has to be able to access every Entity which has some certain combination of Components eg. RenderSystem has to get strongonlystrong Entities which have PositionComponent and AnimationComponent. p  pMy question regards the best data structure for achieving such functionality. p  pMy current idea is to create a Vector with N cells, where N is the number of possible components of List of Entity. So whenever I create instantiate and add certain Components an Entity, I would also reference this Entity from each List for each Component it contains. Killing an Entity would require removing each reference from each List. The problem would be querying which entities have to be processed by a certain System, because the searchkey would be a strongcombinationstrong of Components, and not a single Component, adding overhead to the operation many searches and comparisons would have to be done.p  pIs my idea good Is there any better data structure I can use Note that everything in the game is supposed to be an Entity, summing up to thousands of Entites on a single Level I could possibly use some space partitioning.p

Negative 519 pI am writing a Sybase stored procedure with a cursor fetching records from table and inserting records back. Surprisingly I found that fetches see amd return records inserted in the same loop. Under some conditions this results in endless loop, sometimes the loop ends inseting a number of extra records.

Negative 519 pMy question assumes that the program is compiled using a linux hosted environment as opposed to free standing i.e. embedded system.  My interest in this question is half academic but I do use Ubuntu Linux 12.04.04 LTS for my programming environment and I would just like to know how things works under the hood.p  pFor the purpose of understanding my question Ive written some leadin.  If we agree the following to be pseudocode, so any errors may be glossed over and the answer can be focused around principles, rather than a specific implementation.p  precodeint mainvoid      int j     j  2      if j  2          j  j  1      else          j  j  1           return 0  codepre  pThe assembly output would have compare and branch instructions such as in the follow pseudo  assembly code.  This is my assumption, so if my understanding is way off please set me on track...p  precode.start         LOAD J, 2       j  2         CMP J, 2        if j  2         BNE .else             INC J, 1        j  j  1 .else         DEC J, 1     j   j  j  1 codepre  pSo the resulting machine code may cause the branch to jump relative to the PC.  If we agree each instruction is always 32bits wide for the sake of simplicity, then the BNE .else may produce a machine code instruction that increments the PC  PC  8, since thats the location relative to the branch, basically skipping the INC J, 1 instruction.p  pHowever, if the .else block was further away, then BNE .else could result in an absolute jump to a specific location in memory, in which case the address would be .start  16 bytes.p  pIf the relative jump example were always true, then the program could just be copied to any part of memory, say  pre0x20000000pre or pre0x30000000pre then the PC moved to that location and the code starts running.  The opcode for the branch in each case would be preBNE 0x20000010pre and preBNE 0x30000010pre respectively assuming somehow we found a way to squeeze the BNE opcode into the address by aligning to 4 or 8 bytes boundaries.p  pIf the second absolute jump example were true, then the start location would need to be known at compile time, or the operating system would have to relocate the branch instructions prior to running the program.p  pIf the compiler assumed the code would be run at pre0x00000000pre but the OS wants the code to run at pre0x20000000pre, then the OS would need to alter the branch statements as it loaded the code into memory, laying down the new jump address.p  pSo my questions arep  ol lipTypically, does a compiler produce relative or absolute machine code, or both  Perhaps it just never produces absolute style code to avoid all of this...pli lipIf it does produce absolute machine code, to which address in memory does it assume the code will commencepli lipIf it doesnt fix the address in memory, then does it write the machine code as if it will commence at zero address and how would the OS go about displacing the branch instructions before runningpli ol

Negative 519 pI want to implement a packet counter. Is it possible to restrict other cpu cores from reading or updating the counter variable, unless the current cpu completes its work on the counter variable I want to do it at cpu level i.e. the lock I want to put is on cpu not on memory. Primary goal is to make the counter variable atomic. I have read about locking mechanism and the best way I ended with is using per cpu variable. But, I want to implement packet counters entity wise for eg. I can say I want to count only those packets which have marked or something like that and in this case per cpu variable is not the best option. That is why I want to use a global counter variable and when that variable is being accessed by one of the core of cpu, I want to restrict other cores from accessing it.p

Negative 519 pThere are a number of global variables, lets say for example someglobalvalue1, someglobalvalue2, etc, that are updated dynamically from a different part of the app Im working on. In the part that I am currently working on, I need to gather these variables into an integer array. Because there are a lot of these variables in different groups, I have separate functions like GetGroupOne, GetGroupTwo, etc to insert the globals into an array and return it to the main function. Im using this page as a guide for how to return int arrays from functions a hrefhttpwww.tutorialspoint.comcprogrammingcreturnarraysfromfunction.htm relnofollowhttpwww.tutorialspoint.comcprogrammingcreturnarraysfromfunction.htmap  pSo for examplep  precodeint main     int array    array  GetGroupOne     do stuff with array     return 0   int  GetGroupOne    static int array[GROUPONELENGTH]   someglobalvalue1, someglobalvalue2, someglobalvalue3     return array  codepre  pSo, trying to compile this by the way, I am limited to a C90 compiler gets me this errorp  pError initializer element is not constant when trying to initialize variable with constp  pSo, I did find a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions3025050errorinitializerelementisnotconstantwhentryingtoinitializevariablewError quotinitializer element is not constantquot when trying to initialize variable with consta and other threads that seemed to suggest that what I was trying to do, initialize using globals, is not possible.

Especially because there are multiple groups, some of which have over a hundred entries, so I have to insert each global into the array individually. I know how I would handle this in higher level languages, but C is still somewhat of a mystery to me. But Im thinking there MUST be some better way to handle this problem.

Negative 519 pI would like to have the same effect in my program as the bashterminal does when we kill it using SIGKILL. As we know that we cannot handle SIGKILL in our progams so when ever I kill my program its children are assigned to init process, there is no way to handle it so that I can kill all my child processes and then kill the parent itself. Though when ever we kill terminal all the process created through it are killed even if we kill our terminal by SIGKILL.p  pFor this I did some research and found the below post [a hrefhttpunix.stackexchange.comquestions54963howcanterminalemulatorskilltheirchildrenafterrecievingasigkill5d5b15dhttpunix.stackexchange.comquestions54963howcanterminalemulatorskilltheirchildrenafterrecievingasigkill][1]ap  pThe post is bit confusing, still what I got out of the post is that if the process you are killing is the process leader of the process group then all its children will be killed.p  pSo for simplicity, I implemented below program to test if it is sop  precodeint main      printfCurent PID un, getpid       make a new session     pidt pid  setsid      printfNew session ID un, pid      pid  fork     switchpid                  case 1                     perrorUNable to fork the processn                     exitEXITFAILURE             case 0                      child process                     while 1                                                  sleep1                                          break           while 1                  printfProcess Leader runningn             sleep1       return 0   codepre  pAfter running the above program when I killed the parent process the child process didnt got killed. I also modified the above program so that it does not belong to any tty, I thought might be the process leader should not be associated with any tty. I did that by the following wayp  pCreate a normal process Parent processp  pCreate a child process from within the above parent processp  pThe process hierarchy at this stage looks like   TERMINAL  PARENT PROCESS  CHILD PROCESSp  pTerminate the the parent process.p  pThe child process now becomes orphan and is taken over by the init process.p  pCall setsid function to run the process in new session and have a new group. then the same above code repeats.p  pStill when i killed the process leader children were there. Maybe I didnt got that post on unix.stackexchange or is it the deafult behaviour in LINUX. One way that I can implement to make all children kill is by catching each TERMINATING SIGNAL like SIGTERM, SIGHUP etc. handle them and write logic inside those signal handlers to kill child first.But still on SIGKILL I cant do anything.p  pAlso I am interested to know that if killing parent process doesnt affect child process even if the parent is process leader or whatever then how bashterminal manages to kill all the child processes even if we send SIGKILL to it. Is there some extra logic written for terminals in LINUX kernel.p  pIf there is a way to kill all child processes when parent is killed even using SIGKILL signal, I would be happy to know that too.p

Usually and whenever possible, I use the provided SOAP methods to get results, which since Im using a WSDLcreated interface class and passing parameters in actual object properties this takes care of any escaping necessary via the SOAP libraries.p  pHoweverp  pThere are a few things I have to use direct SQL calls against the DB for, and the API provides a method where you can pass in an SQL query as a string and get back rows of results.

Negative 519 pI have a site Im working on that is using retina.js a hrefhttpimulus.github.ioretinajs relnofollowhttpimulus.github.ioretinajsa to switch out nonretina images for retina images specifically for retina devices.  The site is a responsive HTML website using Twitter Bootstrap.  Heres the problem when the page loads on retina devices, the image is switched out as it should be for retina devices switching over to the image2x.jpg which is fine so far.  The problem is once I resize the browsers window after the retina image has loaded making the browsers width smaller, the images width resizes fine, but the height stays the same effectively squashing the image vertically thus distorting the image.  The same exact thing occurs on iPads and iPhones when changing the orientation.p  pHere is the before imagep  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comcC213.png altenter image description herep  pAnd here is the image after I have resized by browsers width to be smallerp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comMMq1T.png altenter image description herep  pHas anyone experienced this problem beforep

Negative 519 pId like to askverify whether an array of codestruct scatterlistcode that were mapped with codeblkrqmapsgcode are all contiguous at least in virtual address domain.  Well we all know that scatterlists are primarily for DMA, where each scattergather sg array element describes a chunk of memory and those chunks are discontiguous in their physical addresses.p  pIm writing a block device driver.  Suppose I receive struct requests from my requestqueue, and I want to do something with the IO data that my request is holding, like codememcpycodeing them to somewhere.  That operation will need a virtual address and length parameter.  Now all I know is that I can access the requests data via the scatterlist mapped through the helper function codeblkmaprqsgcode.  Is my assumption correct, that those sg elements are contiguous in virtual, and that I can get the data address via codesgvirtcode, and use that address and total length for codememcpycode  Or they are discontiguous in virtual, and I have to walk through each sg array element and codememcpycode tofrom each sg memory chunk in virtual which is harderp

Negative 519 pIm learning C, and am currently studying String Handling. From where Im studying, codestrcmpcode is defined as p  blockquote   pThis is a function which compares two strings to find out whether they   are same or different. The two strings are compared character by   character until there is a mismatch or end of one of the strings is   reached, whichever occurs first. If the two strings are identical,   strcmp  returns a value zero. If theyre not, it returns the numeric   difference between the ASCII values of the first nonmatching pairs of   characters.p blockquote  pThere is a sample program given, which is what my question is about p  precodemain       char string1[ ]  Jerry      char string2[ ]  Ferry      int i, j, k      i  strcmp  string1, Jerry       j  strcmp  string1, string2       k  strcmp  string1, Jerry boy       printf  nd d d, i, j, k    codepre  pI ran this program on DevC on my windows64 bit machine, and got this output  code0 1 1codep  pNow, the book gives the output as code0 4 32code, with this reasoning p  blockquote   pIn the first call to strcmp , the two strings are identicalJerry   and Jerryand the value returned by strcmp  is zero. In the second   call, the first character of Jerry doesnt match with the first   character of Ferry and the result is 4, which is the numeric   difference between ASCII value of J and ASCII value of F. In the   third call to strcmp  Jerry doesnt match with Jerry boy,   because the null character at the end of Jerry doesnt match the   blank in Jerry boy. The value returned is 32, which is the value of   null character minus the ASCII value of space, i.e., 0 minus  ,   which is equal to 32.p blockquote  pTo confirm what the book says, I added this code to my program, just to verify the ASCII difference between J and F p  precodeprintfn Ascii value of J is d, J  printfn Ascii value of F is d, F  codepre  pand then I got this in the output accordingly p  precode Ascii value of J is 74  Ascii value of F is 70 codepre  pThis is according to what the book says, however, as you can see, I get different values of j and k, that is, when the strings dont match. I did look up for similar questions on SO, and got some of them, but could not come across a definite answer for the different outputwhen it returns code1 and 1code, hence I decided to ask a new question. p  pThis question a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions13571907whenwillstrcmpnotreturn10or1rq1herea seems to be somewhat similar, and the question description contains the following information about codestrcmpcodep  blockquote   pThe strcmp and strncmp functions return an integer less than,   equal to, or greater than zero if s1 or the first n bytes thereof is   found, respectively, to be less than, to match, or be greater than s2p blockquote  pIn one of the answers, I came across a hrefhttppubs.opengroup.orgonlinepubs009695399functionsstrcmp.html relnofollowthis linka which documents the functions of codestrcmpcode. It further says p  blockquote   pThe strcmp function shall compare the string pointed to by s1 to the   string pointed to by s2.p      pThe sign of a nonzero return value shall be determined by the sign of   the difference between the values of the first pair of bytes both   interpreted as type unsigned char that differ in the strings being   compared.p      pRETURN VALUEp      pUpon completion, strcmp shall return an integer greater than, equal   to, or less than 0, if the string pointed to by s1 is greater than,   equal to, or less than the string pointed to by s2, respectively.p blockquote  pSo, after reading all this, Im inclined to think that irrespective of the implementationplatform being used, the codestrcmpcode function should be used only to consider the return value as being to one of three categories code0, positive and negativecode, instead of relying on the exact value being returned.p  pAm I correct in my understandingp

Negative 519 pI have a little background with Google Cloud Endpoints on App Engine and the Web Application, iOS and Android Client Ids.  However we are now building a custom piece of hardware.  It will be a gateway that is connected directly to a modem, accepts some data from various sources sensors and relays that information to App Engine.p  pSince this is not a web application, nor a iOS or Android app, would I use the other client ID option in the Credentials for my GCE project  And if so, could someone explain how to communicate with this other client id to a generic cloud endpoint address a curl command would be great since I could follow that easily.p  pThanks for any helpp

Negative 519 pIm using Visual Studio Express 2013 and trying to compile someone elses code. The documentation tells me to set the environment variable QTDIR in the command line and then launch VS from that terminal. But the compiler still thinks QTDIR is what it originally was instead of what I specified in the command line. p  pIve tried to restart the computer and do it again, but the result didnt change. I looked into the project properties, but found nothing that seems to be overriding this variable. And when I clicked the  Macros button in dialogs such as the editing additional include directories dialog, it says QTDIR is what it was originally. Weirdly this happens only to one project in the solution when I opened the Macros from other projects, QTDIR is what I specified in the command linep  pSo I was wondering if there is something that can override an environment variable like this in Visual Studio. Thanksp  ul liEdit The confusing part is when I looked at the property pages of the projects, under codeCommon Properties gtgt User Macroscode and theres nothing defined there.li ul

Negative 519 pIve built an iOS app that uses Facebook Login.  Ive been having trouble getting userfriends permissions to work getting the friends of the user that have used the app.  I realized that it has to do with the App Visibility NOT the visibility of posts.  When a user logs into my app with Facebook, the Facebook App Visibility defaults to Only Me.  For the life of me, I cannot find a place to change this.  There have been answers to similar questions, pointing to the developer page for the app, but theres no place to set the app visibility.p  pDoes anyone know how this visibility is set and how to modify itp  pMany thanksp
Negative 519 pIm in a SharePoint environment wherep  ul lidistribution lists are in use instead of security listsli lican not switch to security listli lidistribution lists are nestedli lino user profile syncli ul  pSo to sync my new SharePoint group something I was thinking of running a PowerShell script regulary to fetch all the members hierarchically and put them in the SharePoint group, including checks. Unfortunately I cant install the AD addin so I installed the Quest AD addin.p  pemupdateem I noticed that direct syncing took too long. So I have decided to split the solution the first AD script output all nested distribution groups GetQADGroupMember Indirect Type group, although this takes as long as getting all users, this feels safer, since probably this doesnt have to been run that much. Then script 2 read the groups and creates a csv file per group, this is certainly not unique, but with tens of thousands of users, this is the safest way. Then script 3 underneath reads the csv files with users and update the SharePoint user group.

Negative 519 pI have been building a game for the last six month using Java and hve come across a problem which I just cant resolve. Below is the best and closest attempt to perfect execution I have got, but it still has a problem.p  pIn my game, a player can buy and sell items at a randomly set prices as he travels the world. When a purchase is made of any item, the quantity of that item gets recorded in the players window, whos total items can be gained through the method getItems2. p  pA feature I would like to add is one that takes the players cash and calculates how many itrms a player can buy with his money. The problem I have is that when shipping these items to another country, this calculation has to consider that a shipping unit can only carry 10000 items and each one costs 700 and the maximum items a ship can carry is 1000000 items100 units total  70000. A player can carry items in his own pockets if he has lt 1000 items, anymore and he is forced to pay shipping fees. This calculation also has to consider that using method getItems2 if a player is already carrying 100000 itrms, then he can only possibly carry 900000 more items if his cash allows him too.p  pMy method below works to a point that I believe the number becomes to large for a long value to carry  I thinkp  pIf anybody could help me solve this problem, any help would be greatly appreciated.

Negative 519 pStrange problem seen while querying a Cisco Call Manager via SNMP v3.  SNMP v2 works fine.  When using getnextrequest, the response is supposed to be a getresponse, but sometimes I get a report response instead, reporting on an oid thats got nothing to do with the oid in the getnextrequest.  Dump from wireshark could be provided if interesting.  The oid in question is 1.3.6.1.4.1.9.9.156.1.2.4.0 phone update table.  Usually the response is a getresponse with an oid similar to 1.3.6.1.4.1.9.9.156.1.2.4.1.2.580, but every now and then the response is a report with oid 1.3.6.1.6.3.15.1.1.2.0 instead, and my application .net using sharpsnmplib reads this as a regular getresponse and gets all confused.  SNMP v3 encryption and authorization seems to be all good. CUCM 10.5 and sharpsnmplib 7.6.p  pAny ideasp
Negative 519 pRouting for a webapp in one place in one file e.g. yaml, xml or properties file to define the routing and urls for a webapp and connecting the urls with individual methods or functions seems like a good idea.Why doesnt Spring do it The framework a hrefhttpwebappimproved.appspot.com relnofollowwebapp2a is like that and easy to handle that way.

Spring however does not have a good way to collect all your routing in one place. Theres some in xml files, some as annotations written directly above the method declaration in handlers and some can be overridden with plugins such as the urlrewrite. p  pWhy cant routing be gathered in one place for a Spring webapp Wouldnt that be better design and a higher cohesion Its also sometimes a problem that you cant have more than one webcontext for a webapp. It seems to be that the servlet specification doesnt allow more than one webcontext for a webapp and that it must be a bijection.

Negative 519 pIs it possible to use segues in Views of ViewControllers instaniated with instantiateViewControllerWithIdentifierp  pHere is a minimal example of what Im trying to do I need something like that in a biger project In the Main Storyboard I have a rootViewController, a secondViewController with the StoryboardID secondViewControllerID and a thirdViewController.

Negative 519 pIm at my wits end and cant seem to figure out this problem. I believe this is a programming question, but it certainly doesnt seem like it until I begin finish describing it.p  pI have a Photo Research SpectraScan 704.

I install the software, and heres where the first problem arises strongit only has the configuration data for a 3173 head.strongp  pThe good news is, the two heads use the same calibration data, its only the name thats different. The bad news is that I cant force the software to load the configuration data for the 3333 with the 3173 files.p  pSo now Im thinking that Ill just rename the config files.

Negative 519 pLooking for some pro advice... We are a bigger corporation of approximately 25,000 employees of relatively large projects wherein 300 employees may have access to BI and the ability to run reports of which are significant amounts of data that in all likelihood, in its raw form, are beyond the default 65,000 row limit Oracle BI is set to.  Therefore most reports need to be tailored such that they fall beneath the row limit.  p  pThis opens up the question  If the row limit were increased to 90,000 or more, would the system be resourcestrained more by running one big query such that users could then use their own tools to pivot or filter information, or is it best to limit the row results perhaps to even 10,000 and run multiple reports and therefore run multiple queries say, 3 or 4 queries to get information from the one big query in the required form.p  pAny help is greatly appreciated, thanks.p

Negative 519 pI have two tables ACC and ACCRestrict. I want to check the values of the column, PR of either tables to see whether I should either insert, update or do nothing to ACCRestrict. If the value is active in ACC but not in ACCRestrict then insert into ACCRestrict if it is still active in both ACC and ACCRestrict then do nothing. If it is not active anymore in ACC but is still in ACCRestrict then update ACCRestrict by updating enddate to todays date. How can I achieve this in informaticap  pEdit There has been a modification of the requirement. ACC will only contain  modifications to the account of someone. So if nothing has changed in someones account we dont see anything in ACC but that doesnt mean if he had a restriction before, it has been lifted. Its just because nothing has changed so it doesnt appear in ACC. How do I manage this p  pNote PR is a restriction on an account. I put the enddate to a date close to infinity and when the restriction is removed from the account I update ACCRestrict by changing enddate to present date.p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comsPNUH.png altenter image description herep  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comUtAVp.png altenter image description herep

Negative 519 pI have searched far and wide, but most Datareader problemanswer pairs concern getting past the first row, not returning anything, getting single values using datareader, etc.. Nothing quite like waht Im encountering at the moment.p  pTo be clear, this is an assignment for my evening class, albeit just a very small part of it.p  pthe function takes size as int the table has two colmuns col1 and col2 of which col1 holds the index value as double and col2 holds a randomly generated double. table is an excel worksheet in a workbook, dont know if thats relevant.p  ptable has been populated using an insert statement carried out by an ADO command object without problems.p  pNow, instead of supplying me with the amount of rows as specified by sizesize in the query as it plays the double role of indexUID in this case, the datareader object fetches seemingly random amounts of rows. I say seemingly, because the number does seem to be fixed to the value of size eg. size  10  datareader contains 3 rows after .executeReader size  2  datareader contains 113 rows size  5  446 rows.p  pWhile debugging I kept track of size parameter for the query remains 10.0 and I cant put my finger on whenwhy reader.Read turns False.p  pI also substituted the parameter in the query string with a literal 5.0 which resulted in a type mismatch in criteria expression exception. But its all Doubles, or am I missing something Im guessing this is going to be the kicker somehow, but Im at a loss right now.p  pAs you can probably guess Im pretty new at programming, so bear with me please.p  pWhat causes my code to behave the way it doesp  precodeprivate Double[] getSelectionint size, string table              ListltDoublegt list  new ListltDoublegt         Double[] toSort          OleDbConnection connect  new OleDbConnectioncntstring         connect.Open         OleDbCommand command  connect.CreateCommand         command.CommandType  CommandType.Text         command.Parameters.Addsize, OleDbType.Double.Value  Convert.ToDoublesize         command.CommandText  String.FormatSELECT  FROM [0] WHERE col1 lt size, table          try                      OleDbDataReader reader  command.ExecuteReader             Double outputReader             while reader.Read                                                                            outputReader  Convert.ToDoublereader.GetValue1  for some reason which is not my main concern at the moment the reader.getDouble method returned an invalid cast exception                 list.AddoutputReader                           toSort  new double[list.Count]             foreach double d in list                              toSort[list.IndexOfd]  d                          string output  String.Format0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9, toSort[0], toSort[1], toSort[2], toSort[3], toSort[4], toSort[5], toSort[6], toSort[7], toSort[8], toSort[9]             to check for values the String.Format is where i first encountered the index out of bounds exception             MessageBox.Showoutput             reader.Close             reader.Dispose                  catch Exception e                      MessageBox.Showe.Message                   finally                      connect.Close             connect.Dispose             return toSort               codepre

Negative 519 pSo in my assignment I am testing the times it takes for different copying functions to copy. One of them I am a bit curious on the results. In one my copy functions it involves allocating memory like sop  precodeint copyfile3char infilename, char outfilename, int size    int infile File handles for source and destination.   int outfile    infile  openinfilename, ORDONLY  Open the input and output files.   if infile lt 0      openfileerrorinfilename     return 1       outfile  openoutfilename, OWRONLY  OCREAT, SIRUSR  SIWUSR   if outfile lt 0      openfileerroroutfilename     return 1       int intch   Character read from input file. must be an int to catch EOF.   char ch  mallocsizeofchar  size  1    gettimeofdayampstart, NULL     Read each character from the file, checking for EOF.   while intch  readinfile, ch, size gt 0       writeoutfile, ch, intch  Write out.       gettimeofdayampend, NULL     All doneclose the files and return success code.   closeinfile   closeoutfile    freech    return 0  Success  codepre  pThe main program allows the user to input the infile outfile copyFunctionNumber. If 3 is chosen the user can input a specific buffer size. So I was testing copying a file 6.3 MB with different buffer sizes. When I choose 1024 it gives a difference of 42,000 microseconds, for 2000 it gives 26,000 microseconds, but for 3000 it gives 34,000 microseconds. My question is why does it go back up And how could you tell what the perfect buffer size will be for the copying to take the least amount of time.p

Negative 519 pIm currently working on a photography store website. Customers will be allowed to view photosets ranging from 100500 images on a page. I want those customers to be able to click a Select All button or other element that checks all the checkboxes on the page. I am currently using jQuery to successfully accomplish this Select All feature after researching here on Stack Overflow.p  pCurrently, the code that I am working with puts a checkbox on each image in the photoset. If the user clicks the checkbox, it triggers a custom event. However, I want the checkbox state of being checked or the change from being unchecked to checked to trigger the event, not the click. If the click triggers the event, the Select All feature I have using jQuery fails to work, since jQuery isnt clicking each of the checkboxes on the page, only changing the checkbox to selected. This means that the custom event doesnt load.p  pThe code that currently works to trigger the event I need by strongclickingstrong which I do not want to do the checkbox isp  precode.selectproduct.onclick, this.QuickOrder.loadProduct codepre  pThe code I am trying to develop isnt working, but it goes something likep  precode    .selectproduct.changefunction             var isChecked  this.ischecked             ifisChecked                   this.QuickOrder.loadProduct                       codepre  pIve used the code.changecode function after researching and finding that the change function registers the change in the condition of the checkbox.

Negative 519 pIm writing my first Go project using a hrefhttpsgodoc.orggithub.comjmoironsqlx relnofollowsqlxa and want to use Prepared statements.p  pIm not sure whats the recommended practice to initialise and keep the Prepared statement variables in a nice manageable way.p  pI want them to be accessible only from the part of the code which actually has to use them, so far each statement is used by a single function, so global variables are not a good option besides generally being frowned upon.p  pIn CC I would probably use a function static variable and initialise it the first time that the function is entered. This way the information about the statement content and the call which uses it are close to each other.p  pBut from what I know so far there is no method static variables in Go, so whats the alternativep  pI found references to Closures, which are anonymous functions, but is this the best way to achieve this Am I aiming for the right thing from perspective of prepared statements best practicesp

Ive made the WCFSOAP service a websocket client as I am cornered into using WebSocket Sharp for backwards compatibility with Server 2008Win 7. This works decently, for about 30 seconds, then IIS disposes of my instance of the WebSocket client and I have to reconnect. This results in a loss of messages randomly.

Negative 519 pWindows 7, In Python 3.4 I created a very simple program that just prints  Something. And made a very simple gui in QT Designer for it with 1 button Print it. Converted .ui file to .py file, made some adjustments.p  pEverything works, BUT for printing it opens console and prints Something there.  I want this Something to be printed INSIDE my widget. And If any mistakes in program  I want them also to be printed INSIDE my widget.p  pWhat element of QT Designer should I use An element which takes all printing from program and prints it inside itself. Or maybe I should use something else but function Printp  pThank you very much.p

Negative 519 pConsidering the following join algorithmp  precode For each r  R do     For each s  S do         if r.C  s.C then output r,s pair codepre  pnr is the number of tuples in R, br is the number of blocks in Rp  pThe textbook say that in worst case, the buffer can only hold one block and it takes nr  bs  br times of transfer.p  pBut I think, if the buffer can only hold one block,then every time after we finish loading the blocks in S, the block of R we loaded in before will be swapped out. Then if we want to visit the next tuple of R, shouldnt we load the block again even if we have loaded it before ie I initially load the first tuple in R, in order to do so I need to load the first block in R then I load the entire S, and compare their key. After I finish the inner loop, the first block of R has been swapped out, so when I try to load the second tuple in R, I need to load the first block again. Therefore I need load R every time when I try to access a tuple in R.p  pSo why the worst case is not nr  bs  nrp
Negative 519 pIs it a fact that most host providers that provide mysql as a part of other services such as website hosting, limit access to mysql by only phpmyadmin or within the hosted application is self p  pthis seems obvious for me where when i for example try to connect from my localhost by mysql workbench to remote mysql of some of the host providers out there i get either access denied even if i allowed privileges for anyone to access this mysql host , or i get could not connect message for some reason.p  pOn the other hand when a host provider provides only mysql as the main service not a part of other services i could access my database from any where normally.p  pSo i wanted to know if what i said was true.p  pTake an example by registering to for example any free php hosting websites out there that include mysql as a part of the services , you will find that you cant access your mysql data from mysql workbench in your local machine for example.p

Negative 519 pI am building an asp.net MVCWeb API application where I will be returning arbitrary data from a view, and the type of data is not known at design time. p  pSpecifically, the user will specify some URI, and my back end will fetch that uri.  The data returned might be a straight texthtml web page, or it could return an RSS feed with a textrssxml content type, or it might return a JSON payload, etc.  I wont know the format of the data until runtime, after I fetch the data and inspect the contenttype.  p  pMy objective for all intents and purposes  irrelevant detail omitted is to echo that payload back to the user.

Negative 519 pIm currently implementing my own math parser  and i have a few questions on how to proceed.p  pSo far my parser is converting an input string into Tokensp  precodepublic class Token          final public String expression     final public int value      public TokenString expression, int value                this.expression  expression         this.value  value       codepre  pEach String, expression, is a valid entry  number, operator or a function. The Integer type is passed into an enum to identify the token. p  pWhen the input string is separated into tokens the expression will be parsed with the a hrefhttpen.wikipedia.orgwikiShuntingyardalgorithm relnofollowShuntingyarda algorithm. p  pstrongMy questionstrong I want the tokens to create objects of their type.

The downside is that Token returns an Object, and not an Operator or a Function. The difference between methods in an operator and a function is obviously not big. p  pAn operator has the methodp  precodegetValueString number1, String number2 codepre  pAnd a function has the methodp  precodegetValueString number codepre  pCan i somehow implement an Interface and override the method getValue to be one of the abovep

And then I added a paymenttypelist.js in codeapproutecode which has the following codep  precodeimport Ember from ember  export default Ember.Route.extend     model function         return this.store.findAllpaymenttype       codepre  pNext I added a model named paymenttype in codeappmodelscode which looks something like thisp  precodeimport DS from emberdata  var attr  DS.attr  export default DS.Model.extend     name attrstring,     inoutFlag attrstring,     shortCode attrstring,     paymentType attrstring,     bankAccountRequiredFlag attrstring,     depositSlipFlag attrstring,     maccPaymentFlag attrstring,     referenceRequiredFlag attrstring,     confirmationRequiredFlag attrstring,     creditCardRequiredFlag attrstring,     payeeRequiredFlag attrstring,     affectsBankAccountFlag attrstring,     clearanceRequiredFlag attrstring,     paymentRequiredFlag attrstring,     outstandingFlag attrstring,     includeInBankFile attrstring,     defaultDirectPayTypeCode attr,     inspecieTransferFlag attr  codepre  pNext I created an adapter to get data named codepaymenttypecode in codeappadapterscode, which looks something like this     import DS from emberdatap  precodeexport default DS.RESTAdapter.extend     host httplocalhost8080composerBackendpaymentTypes  codepre  pThe problem is that I cannot understand how to handle the naming conventions of the models and other areas of the application. Such that the camelCased model names in the application maps to my model and adapter.p

Negative 519 pWere encountering an UnknownHostException when our application calls java.net.InetAddress.getLocalHost. This issue is only seen when our docker image built from registry.ng.Bluemix.netibmliberty runs in Bluemix. Running the same container on nonBluemix hosts yield successful responses from the method. While most of the call locations use this value for information purposes and etchostname holds the instance name of the container, we dont want to write special code to look into that file.
