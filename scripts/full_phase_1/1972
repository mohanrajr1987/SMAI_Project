Positive 1972 pI have a need to convert some of my perl CGIscripts to binaries. But when I have a script of 100kb converted into binary it becomes about 23Mb. This is understood why, as compiler has to pack inside all the needed tools to execute the script. The question is about the time of pages loading on the server, when they are binary. Say, if I have a binary perlscript script, that answers on ajax requests and that binary weights about 3mb, will it reflect on AJAX requests If, say, some users have low connection, will they wait for ages until all these 3Mb will be transferred Or, the server WONT send all the 3mb to a user, but just an answer short XMLJSON whatsoeverp  pAnother case is when I have HTML page, that is generated by this binary perlscript on the server. User addresses his browser to the script, that weights 3Mb and after he has to get an HTML page. Will the user wait again, until the whole script is been loaded every single byte form those 3Mb, or just wait the time that is needed to load EXACTLY the HTML page say, 70Kb, and the rest mass will be run on the serverside only and wont make the user to wait for itp  pThanksp

Positive 1972 pIm trying to accomplish the followingp  ul liPull information from a module through Python. [Accomplished]li liConstantly pull information from Python for use in HTML.li liAvoid writing the entire HTMLCSSJS document in print statements.li ul  pIve seen the term CGI thrown around, but dont really understand how it works. Simply put, I want to run the Python script which returns an integer value. I then would like to take that integer value into JavaScript so that it may update the designated tag. It should be able to execute the Python script every two seconds, receive the output, then apply it to the page. I do not want to write out the entire HTML document in Python by doing one line at a time, as Ive seen some people doing on sites Ive found.p  pIt seems like doing something like this is far more complicated than it should be. The page should run, call the script for its output, then give me the output to use.p
Positive 1972 pSo heres the deal  Im writing a simple lightweight IRC app, hosted locally, that basically does the same job as Xchat and works in your browser, just as Sabnzbd. I display search results in the browser as an html table, and using an AJAX GET request with an onclick event, the download is launched. I use another AJAX GET request in a 1 second loop to request the download information status, progress, speed, ETA, etc.. I hit a bump with the simultaneous AJAX requests, since my CGI handler seems to only be able to handle one thread at a time  indeed, the main thread processes the download, while requests for download status are sent too. Since I had a Django app somewhere, I tried implementing this IRC app and everything works fine. Simultaneous requests are handled properly. So is there something I have to know with the HTTP handler  Is it not possible with the basic CGI handle to deal with simultaneous requests  I use the following for my CGI IRC app p  precodefrom http.server import BaseHTTPRequestHandler, HTTPServer, CGIHTTPRequestHandler codepre  pIf its not about theory but about my code, I can gladly post various python scripts if it helps.p
Positive 1972 pIm not really a programmer but Im making basic changes to a preexisting cgi script to adapt it for a new data form on my site.p  pBasically this is a form that users fill out, the form collects data and writes that data to a separate data file.p  pThere is a line of code in it that, based on the form responses received, either spits out an information missing response or a submission received response depending on what response is given. For examplep  precodeif  firname eq   lastname eq   email eq   codepre  pIm trying to add another line where people will receive the same responses as above but where they will get a info missing if they dont put an accepted code into one a specific field.

In other words, how can the user be allowed to input 12345 emorem 67890 Here are some attempts I wrote that did NOT workp  precodeif  firname eq   lastname eq   email eq    code ne 12345  code ne 67890   if  firname eq   lastname eq   email eq    code ne 12345 ampamp code ne 67890   if  firname eq   lastname eq   email eq    if  code ne 12345 ampamp code ne 67890  codepre
Positive 1972 pIn one of my projects Im using codecgi.escapecode to escape a set of titles that I get from a resource.

Since perl would be doing all the leg work anyway, it seems using the cgi for parameter passing should be natural, but maybe theres no real problem with having bash manage the http requestp  pAnother way is to use a Perl CGI file to parse the config file, and set the environment variables based on the parsing.

Positive 1972 pI have been playing around with a perl based ticketing tool called Request Tracker.  A plugin exists which allows for nginx to be installed.  The plugin comes with a startup script which starts nginx and fcgi.p  pstrongFrom within the web interface, if I granted a user specific rights, they could execute commands on the server as root.strongp  pI found that I could only get the the startup script as root, as nginx needs to start as root to bind a low port like 80.  The nginx web server seems to start correctly.  The master process starts as root, and the worker process starts as the user defined in nginx.conf.  p  pThe fcgi process however, does not start as the predefined web user.  Instead, it starts as root.  I assumed that the startup script provided with the plugin would run both as the correct user.  I figured that this was the reason why I was able to execute commands as root on the server.p  pInstead of having the startup script starting both nginx and fcgi, I started them separately.p  pI started nginx as root, however I started fcgi as the account associated with the webserver.  The website seems to function normally, and now I can only execute code as the webserver account from the web interface.p  pMy questionsp  ol lipIs running the CGI as root a definite security flaw, or could this be something that is commonnecessary for certain webappspli lipIs it acceptable for a web app to execute code on the server as root when logged in with the web apps admin accountpli ol

For example, the following method generates two such warnings because Im accessing the Make and Model properties of the car object without first checking for null.p  precode    public IEnumerableltstringgt GetCarModelsByMakestring make              return from car in Cars                where car.Make  make                select car.Model      codepre  pIn my particular case, I know that the Cars collection will never contain any null entries, so I figured I could just add an Assume to the method to silence the static checker, like sop  precode    public IEnumerableltstringgt GetCarModelsByMakestring make              Contract.AssumeCars.Allcar gt car  null          return from car in Cars                where car.Make  make                select car.Model      codepre  pBut that doesnt work, presumably because its a bit too much to expect the static checker to understand. So, I decided to just suppress the warnings using the following SuppressMessage attributep  precode    [SuppressMessageMicrosoft.Contracts, NonNull] codepre  pBut for some reason, that fails to suppress the warnings.  I even tried the following SuppressMessage attributes as well, none of which workedp  precode    [SuppressMessageMicrosoft.Contracts, Requires]     [SuppressMessageMicrosoft.Contracts, Ensures]     [SuppressMessageMicrosoft.Contracts, Invariant] codepre  pI even tried to completely disable contract verification for the method using the ContractVerification attributep  precode    [ContractVerificationfalse] codepre  pBut that didnt work either.  So, I decided Id just add an explicit null check in the where clause of the LINQ statementp  precode    public IEnumerableltstringgt GetCarModelsByMakestring make              return from car in Cars                where car  null ampamp car.Make  make                select car.Model      codepre  pThat successfully gets rid of the warning on the where clause, but it doesnt eliminate the warning for the select clause.  In fact, the only way Ive found to actually get rid of both warnings is to add null checks to every clause in the LINQ statement, like sop  precode    public IEnumerableltstringgt GetCarModelsByMakestring make              return from car in Cars                where car  null ampamp car.Make  make                select car  null  null  car.Model      codepre  pClearly, that is not very clean or efficient code, and I dont actually intend to add such redundant null checks to all of my LINQ statements  especially when I know the enumeration doesnt contain any null entries.  The best solution to this problem would be for the static checker to understand Contract.Assume statements that ensure nonnull values for each item in the collection, but if that cant be done, then at least honor the SuppressMessage attribute on the method.p

Negative 1972 pI have a Html Helper file for my ASP.NET MVC application. The majority of them simply return a formatted string.p  pHere is an example of one of my formatted string helpersp  precodepublic static string Labelthis HtmlHelper helper, string for, string text      return string.Formatltlabel for 0gt1ltlabelgt, for, text  codepre  pHere is a TagBuilder version that gives me the same result as abovep  precodepublic static string Labelthis HtmlHelper helper, string for, string text      var builder  new TagBuilderlabel     builder.Attributes.Addfor, for     builder.SetInnerTexttext     return builder.ToStringTagRenderMode.Normal  codepre  pNow, a few sites I have been readinglearning about MVC from mix up implementations. Some use the codeTagBuildercode method, others use codestring.Formatcode, and some use both interchangeably.p  pThe label tag is rather simple, so would it be better to just return a formatted string rather than instantiate the codeTagBuildercode class for tags like this onep  pI am not necessarily worried about performance, I am just curious as to why some choose TagBuilder and others use formatted strings.p  pThanks for the enlightenmentp

Negative 1972 pFolks,   I am building a RESTful service that is secured by providing an XMLDSIG XML signature at the bottom of the XML document. When I send this document to the server, the WCF service is doing the XML deserialization method on the HTTP payload to give me a C class.

Negative 1972 pThis is a bit of an oddball question given how the team Ive joined is using SVN.  Basically, the svn repository follows a standard layout, but trunk really hasnt been touched in 1.5 years or so and work tends to happen in branches and branches of branches only.  As such, Ive used gitsvn to clone from the branch that represents the active branch for our next release and that is what master tracks in my local git repository.  Lets call this branch in svn release from here on out.   Using gitsvn for this purpose is just hunky dory.p  pNow, someone has created a feature branch off of release, that Im going to call feature, that Id like to pull down to a local branch of mine, and commit to as well.  Sure, I can get away with just cloning that branch off into another directorygit repository locally, but what Id really like to do is have feature mirrored in a local branch within my local git repository as well to make merging between the two as straightfoward as possible.

Negative 1972 pI am working on a project that processes images, saves the processed images in a cache, and outputs the processed image to the client. Lets say that the project is located in project, the cache is located in projectcache, and the source images are located wherever else on the server like in images or otherprojectimages. I can set up the cache to mirror the path to the source image e.g. if the source image is imagesimage.jpg, the cache for that image could be projectcacheimagesimage.jpg, and the requests to the project are roughly projectpathtoimage e.g. projectimagesimage.jpg.p  pI would like to serve the images from the cache, if they exist, as efficiently as possible.

Negative 1972 pI am still fairly new at playing with PHP. I wanted to poke at a small project. I have the ability to access an xml feed from our calendar system at work.

Negative 1972 pI have a codeUIScrollViewcode and a codeUITapGestureRecognizercodewhich are both pretty basic, and have got them to work together in every way I need except one. The codeUIScrollViewcode doesnt use any zooming, and the codeUITapGestureRecognizercode just writes to the console for now. p  pI can get the codeUITapGestureRecognizercode to write to the console when the codeUIScrollViewcode is tapped, either while stationary or animating through codesetContentOffsetcode, but I cannot get it to work when the codeUIScrollViewcode is moving due to being swiped. When the codeUIScrollViewcode is swiped and still in motion, the first tap after swiping will stop it moving, and then only the second tap is picked up by the codeUITapGestureRecognizercode. I hope to get the first tap to both stop the codeUIScrollViewcode from scrolling and also write to the console through the codeUITapGestureRecognizercode. p  pI hope that my problem here is just through a gap in my knowledge of either the codeUIScrollViewcode or codeUITapGestureRecognizercode and there is just a Property to set to fix this, but so far no amount of reading has helped me with this issue. Any ideas on whether this is possible p  pstrongEdit Thanks for the suggestions, please see belowstrong p  pApologies, I dont think I explained myself very well. I realise the first movement on the stationary codeUIScrollViewcode is a swipe which in my case is just handled by the codeUIScrollViewcode btw, not a gesture recognizer. p  pThe problem is after swiping and releasing, if you tap  emwhile it is still in motionem and no other touch is in progress, it isnt picked up by the codeUITapGestureRecognizercode, instead it is only picked up by the codeUIScrollViewcode and  stops the codeUIScrollViewcode moving. If you let it decelerate then tap, this works fine. Also if it is moving due to an animation but not a swipe, the tap also works fine. p  pThis is the same when using a UILongPressGestureRecognizer which is what I want to use ideally, but thought if I cant get it to work with a tap, I have no chance with that  p

Negative 1972 pMy team is about to make a release, and we want to tag the release in subversion. The release v.1 consists of several applications and they all reference shared libraries. Iv read that the most commonly used way to organize trunkbranchestags is to do it per project.p  pQuestion 1 So to make a release with this structure will I have to tags each and every project separatly What Im thinking is that I could create several levels of trunkbranchestags, one in the root and one for each project. This would allow me to create a tag for all my code from the root trunk.p  precodewould look something like this rep     trunk         office             project1                 trunk                 branches                 tags             project2                 trunk                 branches                 tags         shared             sharedproject                 trunk                 branches                 tags     tags     branches codepre  pQuestion 2 If my solution to Q1 is a bad idea and I have to tag each project for itself, what then, if we later find a bug in v.1 and need to make a hotfix. Do I then again have to manually switch each project to the v.1 tag and branch each of them to a development branchp  pstrongEditstrongp  pThank you for your answers. Ive decided that Im gonna convince my team to move to Mercurical, seems like the right VCS for how we want to work. Ive also looked at git but hq looks more smooth.p

Negative 1972 pLets say I have a large number of worker threads all actively processing, and a supervisor thread that waits for them all to complete. Traditionally I could do something like p  precodeforWorker wstaff     w.start  forWorker wstaff     w.join  codepre  p..and all would be well. However in this case the size of my worker list ArrayList staff is variable and may change at arbitrary times. My best knowledge tells me something like this should workp  precodesynchronizedthis     forWorker wstaff         w.start       whiletrue this loop will keep the supervisor running until all workers have stopped                   interrupts will occur when changes to the size of staff list occur     try         IteratorltWorkergt it         synchronizedthis             it  staff.iterator                  whileit.hasNext             Worker w  it.next             w.join                  return     catchInterruptedException iecontinue  codepre  pThis however, still results in a conncurrentModificationException on the line p  precodeWorker w  it.next codepre  p...which to me seems strange, because I thought that once you retrieved the iterator it was separate from the list itself. My next idea is to clone the iterator or staff list so that it IS separate from the original changing list, but I thought I would give you experts a shot at it first.p
Negative 1972 pSo, I have images in a div that share the same class and one of them is selected at a time for a single view of that image. In this single view, I have arrows that I want to use to cycle between the images. The images sharing the same class have sequential alt values.p  pRight now, I can get the preceding alt value and set the src of the image in the single view to the source of that image. But, I cant seem to get the same effect with the following image.p  precode    leftButton.clickfunction             var current img[idselected]             var altValcurrent.attralt.valueOf1             ifaltValgt0                              var next img[altaltVal]                 current.attrid,                  next.attrid, selected                 embiggenImage.attrsrc, next.attrsrc                                 rightButton.clickfunction             var galimg[classgalleryImage]             alertgal.length             var current img[idselected]             var altValcurrent.attralt.valueOf1             ifaltValltgal.length                              alertinside                 var next img[altaltVal]                 current.attrid,                  next.attrid, selected                 embiggenImage.attrsrc, next.attrsrc                            codepre  pAs you can see, the code for changing the sources is exactly the same, and it reaches those two alerts fine, but returns a null source.p  pEdit It seems that in the leftButton click function, alt is being properly decremented, but in the rightButton click function, when I am trying to increment alt, it instead, is appending the 1, such that the final value of altVal is 01. This does not make any sense to me..p

Negative 1972 pIm afraid I am fairly new to varnish but I have a problem whch I cannot find a solution to anywhere yet Varnish is set up to cache GET requests. We have some requests which have so many parameters that we decided to pass them in the body of the request. This works fine when we bypass Varnish but when we go through Varnish for caching, the request is passed on without the body, so the service behind Varnish fails. p  pI know we could use POST, but we want to GET data. I also know that Varnish CAN pass the request body on if we use pass mode but as far as I can see, requests made in pass mode arent cached. Ive already put a hash into the url so that when things work, we will actually get the correct data from cache as far as the url goes the calls would otherwise all look to be the same.p  pThe problem now is just how to rewrite vclfetch to pass on the request body to the webserver Any hints and tips welcomep  pThanks in advancep  pJonp

A user can create a ReleaseVersion object and give it a name like MyAppv7.5.0.132. 2. For this ReleaseVersion he will create a Template with a name like BookingTest which consists of a many OrganisationUnit objects hierarchical structure where each OrganisationUnit can have many TemplateTeststep objects.p  p3. A TemplateTeststep object consists of these fieldsp  precode a PreCondition  b Teststep  c ExpectedResult codepre  p4. After he created the Template object he is creating a Testplan object basing on the former created Template. 5. A Testplan strongSHOULDstrong display in the stronguserinterfacestrong the same OrganisationUnits but instead of the TempalteTeststep objects I need to display additional fields which are related ONLY to the Testplan namedp  precode d ErrorException  e TestStatus codepre  pSo in the Testplan there is the OrganisationUnit TreeView and a DataGrid with the 5 fields a,b,c,d,e.p  p5. When I click the save Testplan button the fields a,b,c are updated with the fields belonging to the Template. When I click the save Testplan button the fields d and e are updated with the fields belonging to the XXX.p  pThe unknown component is XXX. I already thought about a table named TestplanTeststep with 2 fields.p  pBut to which other table should this be relatedp  pAbove all I have to be very carefull, that a strongTemplateTeststepstrong and a strongTestplanTeststepstrong has the same Id when I save them to database and retrieve them the next time else I could mix up data.p  pThats the entity relation description so farp  pstrong1 ReleaseVersion has N Testplanstrong that seems right to me because a Testplan is only valid for a certain ReleaseVersionp  pstrongN Testplan has M Unitstrong here is something wrongp  pstrong1 Unit has N TestplanTeststepstrong here is something wrongp  pstrong1 Template has N Testplanstrong that seems right to me because a Testplan can not belong to another Template, after its creation its used in no other context as just open itp  pstrong1 Template has N Unitstrong that seems right to me because a certain UnitId cant be used in another template no need for it, every template has its own treeOrganisationUnit datap  pstrong1 Unit has N TemplateTeststepstrong that seems right to me because these 3 fields a,b,c belong to a certain UnitId and in the TreeView are only the OrganisationUnits loaded related to the Template of a Testplanp  pFinal questionp  pWhat needs to be done in my entity relations that all makes sensep  pThe stupid thing is the separation of the TemplateTeststep and the TestplanTeststep because they could be actually ONE object or ONE table. But then I would save lots of duplicate data with the fields a,b,c which are the same for every template thus for every Testplan too.p

Negative 1972 pI am wondering how to best implement a readonly ContentProvider. I want my data source to be modified only from within my own application through additional special methods of my ContentProvider which of course are not accessible through a ContentResolver. In other words, other applications should only be able to use my ContentProviders query method but not insert, delete, or update.p  pThe obvious solution seems to be to just return null00 and do nothing else in insertdeleteupdate. Would it be better to always throw an Exception in these methods instead so as to communicate clearly that these operations are not allowed Or is there even a possibility of restricting the access to the ContentProvider to the query method only via permissionsp

Negative 1972 blockquote   pThe blocking VM performance is better overall, as there is no time lost in   synchronization, spawning of threads, and resuming blocked   clients waiting for values. So if you are willing to accept an higher   latency from time to time, blocking VM can be a good pick. Especially   if swapping happens rarely and most of your often accessed data   happens to fit in your memory.p blockquote  pThis is default mode of Redis and the only mode going forward I believe now VM is deprecated in 2.6, leaving the OS to handle paging ifwhen required. I am correct in my understanding that it will take some time to get hot when bootedstarted. When working on a 1gb RAM node with a 16gb dataset, does Redis attempt to load it all into virtual memory at boot and thus 90 is immediately paged out, and only after some good amount of usages does the above statement hold true p

Each time the tool gets used, players can select 5 different units from a large collection of units. These units can be combined with other static entities lets call these pools in a variety of ways. The units have characteristics that may or may not improve the players strategy if they are combined with certain pools. For examplep  ul liUnit A loves to be in pool 1 but hates to be in pool 2li liUnit B hates to be in pool 1 unless if Unit A is there as wellli lietc..li ul  pstrongThe tools purpose is to find the best combinations of which units go in which pool.strong These are the rulesp  ul liThere are always 5 different units selected out of a collection of about 50. All these units have different characteristics.li liThere are always the same 5 pools. They have different characteristics but the pools are not selected out of a larger collection, theyre always the same.li liEach pool can contain multiple units, from 0 to 5.li liEach unit can only be in one pool.li ul  pstrongThe input isstrongp  ul liA list of 5 variable units A, B, C, D, Eli liA list of 5 static pools Pool1, Pool2, Pool3, Pool4, Pool5li ul  pstrongThe output should be, all possible combinations between these two listsstrong, based on the aforementioned rules.

Negative 1972 pI am developing a system with Symfony which has a notification module integrated into it. The purpose of the script is to allow for a wide range of compatibility, and as such the requirements would leave cron, root amp shell out of the question.p  pCurrently, the system sends notifications when specific actions are executed. For example, making a post, uploading a file, changing a status, ect. The problem with this approach is that it can cause certain actions to be very slow if there is a substantial number of users with notification subscriptions.p  pMy question is  are there any solutions that would allow me to queue and defer this notification task until after the action has been executed Thereby eliminated any lag connected to large email tasks. p  pThanks in advance for your help  much appreciatedp
Negative 1972 pAll,p  pI am developing a simple Java web app using Play v 1.2.4 framework.  The application performs a signed ItemLookup request using Amazons Product Advertising API.  I am deploying the application to Google App Engine GAE, wherein lies my problem.p  pstrongDetailsstrong In localtesting mode, the AWS signed request works perfectly using both apache.commons.httpclient and the simpler java.net.URL.  After deploying to GAE and finding that an HTTPClient connection was not supported bc of the usage of SocketConnection, I modified the AWS calls to use strongjava.net.URLstrong.  The AWS ItemLookup requests not only continued to work in local mode, but I no longer received any exceptions in Google App Engine GAE.p  pstrongProblemstrong However, the problem I am having is that all of my AWS ItemLookup requests come back with a message that the signed signature does not match what AWS was expecting.  See the actual message at the end of this question.p  pTherefore, Im rather unsure of what is happening.  I am logging the requests that go out from both local mode and GAE and the format of the signed URL request does not appear to have any problems.  Ive checked and doubletriplechecked my requests are going out with the correct AWS key. These calls work with the same keys in local mode, therefore should they not work via GAE as well  For example, a sample request on GAE with AWS keytag stripped outp  precode    SIGNED REQUESThttpecs.amazonaws.comoncaxmlAWSAccessKeyIdltremovedgtampAssociateTagltremovedgtampItemIdB0051VVOB2ampOperationItemLookupampResponseGroupLargeampServiceAWSECommerceServiceampTimestamp20120304T003A523A23ZampVersion20110801ampSignatureltremovedgt codepre  pSo, Im starting to think that the strongHmacSHA256strong on GAE may be working incorrectly, or perhaps I need to use a different algorithm on GAEp  pPerhaps Ive run up against some sort of issue with using AWS on GAE  I could really use some help on this problem.p  pThank you for your assistance.p  pstrongItemLookup Response Error examplestrongp  precode    ltItemLookupErrorResponse xmlnshttpecs.amazonaws.comdoc20110801gt     ltErrorgt     ltCodegtSignatureDoesNotMatchltCodegt     ltMessagegtThe request signature we calculated does not match the signature you provided.

Negative 1972 pI am trying to send over image data from a compiled C process to a compiled C process. The C process is accessing the webcam and doing some processing on the image. The image is represented by an 2D array of pixels with each pixel value being an 8 bit value 0255 which is the grayscale value of that pixel.  The image size is 640 by 480.p  pThe C application does some more processing and displays this image onto the screen. The processes are both running at the same time on my laptop Windows 7 OS but I cannot make a single process that does all the steps which is why I need my C and C code to communicate.p  pI was wondering what is the best way to do this I read about writing a UDP or TCP server in the C part and a client on the C part, I can then send over the image data as a datagram. I was wondering if this is the best way and if it is whether UDP or TCP would be better p  pEDIT The C process is unmanaged C, I dont have the option to run it as a managed DLL. Could I use named pipes to send over the imagep  pFinally is UDP guaranteed in order if it is communicating locally I realise the image would be over the limit for UDP but if it is inorder I should be able to split the images up to send over.p

Negative 1972 pI am designing a client server socket program using TCPIP.p  pThe server listens on a certain port, the client program makes 2 connections to the server. One is for command and response and the other is for streaming of data.p  pFor the command and response, I can use the normal blocking socket mode to receive the client command and send the server response.p  pFor the streaming data, the server would wait for the client to send a start stream command and begins continuous sending of data to that client. The issue now is I need the handler to also listen on this connection for the stop stream command. Hence, I was thinking of making this connection nonblocking so that the receive would not block followed by a nonblocking send.p  pIs this method of implementing the server and client handler efficientp

Negative 1972 pI had really a simple site written in PHP that I have just rewritten into a singlepage HTML only solution using codecodesections.p  pNow I would like to map the old querystrings used to new hashbased URLs instead. That would mean that for example codeiditemAcode should become codenewAndImprovedItemAcode the old ids are not the same as the new hashes, yet since there are only four possible values, it shouldnt be too much work to manually map them I guess. Apparently this is not working with a simple RedirectPermanent, but from what I understand I have to use RewriteRules. Unfortunately I dont have any experience with that at all, so I wasnt able to come up with anything that is properly working yet.p  pAt the moment I am usingp  precodeRewriteEngine on RewriteCond QUERYSTRING  iditemA RewriteRule index.php newAndImprovedItemA [L] codepre  pwhich will redirect me to the new codeindex.htmlcode, but will not add the hash.

Is that way feasible, considering how detailed the ELF ABI isp  pI hope for any suggestions and pointers to good available resources available.p
Negative 1972 pDoes anyone knows how to stop Wordperss from redirecting the users to the default internal server error page when they forget to fill in a mandatory field in a comment form p  pon my blog site i have the default comment form with the usual mandatory username and email fields. If a user forgot to type the email, for example, they are redirected to a different page with a box and a message inside telling the user that all fields are required and a big Internal Server Error message appears.p  pThis is simply ugly and does not help the users experience in the site. For a small error like forgetting to type in a mandatory field why would WP redirect the users to a page shouldnt the user be getting a small error message underabove the form to tell them that they did not enter a required field it seems that when WP redirect the user to that default error page as if some catastrophic error had occurred in the site.p  pI want to simply be able to notify the user that they forgot to enter a mandatory field on the same form not redirect them to a different error page. I dont know much about PHP. I hope any solution will not have to involve too much PHP coding.p  pAny ideas any helpp

Negative 1972 pIm developing a three layer application with web services exposing underlaying business methods. Web services are implemented with Jersey in RESTful style and the layer is protected by a filter which implements emcom.sun.jersey.spi.container.ResourceFilterFactoryem in this filter I have implemented my custom authorization mechanism. All this is packaged in a web application that I will call embackendem. I know that lot of you will criticize this because web services are stateless for nature, but we are speaking of a bank context and everything must be checked and authorized. So please forgive me P p  pThen I have an other distinct application the client which makes async requests to the backend, all this requests have to be preauthorized by the backend itself.p  pThis client makes requests in two waysp  ul liThe first is via Struts 2 in an action loginli liSecond way is via jQuery ajax generic data retrievingli ul  pThe problem in this scenario is that when the first call via Struts2 is made login the backend opens a session, otherwise when all the jQuery ajax calls are made the backend opens another session. The result is that all the jQuery ajax calls are not authorized because the authentication is made in two different sessions. What I want to achieve is to use the same session for all kind of calls, considering that the calls happen from the same client.p  pAny idea p  pp  pAlexp

Negative 1972 pIm creating a program in Java that will interface with a C library to take images from hardware and display with OpenGL using JOGL.  So the workflow is thisp  pcodeHardware gt C gt disk image file gt Java gt JOGLcodep  pI have the codeJava gt JOGLcode part working fine.  The images are displayed fully and I can load multiple images at a time.  I also have the codeHardware gt Ccode working as well, and a temporary viewer in C is showing that the images are being created just fine.p  pThe crux of the problem is this I want to be able to launch the codemaincode method of the Java program in C and then display the image using only JNI code in C using static methods Ive created.  However, when I do this, the image is truncated, where I only get the top 20 or so rows.

I suppose a hrefhttphackage.haskell.orgtrachaskellprimewikiViewsViewsa or a hrefhttphackage.haskell.orgtrachaskellprimewikiPatternSynonymsPattern Synonymsa would solve it.li liThe computation of the memoized fields free variables, depth is tightly coupled to the smart constructors.

Negative 1972 pThis question is related to a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions13804373pbsjobnooutputwhenbusypbs job no output when busya. i.e Some of the jobs I submit produce no output when PBSTorque is busy.  I imagine that it is busier when many jobs are being submitted one after another, and as it so happens, of the jobs submitted in this fashion, I often get some that do not produce any output.  p  pHerere some codes.p  pSuppose I have a python script called xanalyse.py that takes as its input a file containing some data, and analyses the data stored in the file p  precode.xanalyse.py data1.pkl codepre  pNow, suppose I need to 1 Prepare N such data files data1.pkl, data2.pkl, ..., dataN.pkl 2 Have xanalyse.py work on each of them, and write the results to a file for each of them. 3 Since the analysis of different data files are all independent of each other, I am going to use PBSTorque to run them in parallel to save time. I think this is essentially an embarrassingly parallel problem.p  pI have this python script to do the abovep  precodeimport os import sys import time  N  100  for k in range1, N1     datafilename  datad  k     file  opendatafilename  .pkl, wb     Prepare data set k, and save it in the file     file.close      jobname  analysisd  k     file  openjobname  .sub, w     file.writelines [ binbashn,                        PBS N sn  jobname,                        PBS o sn  jobname  .out,                        PBS q computen ,                        PBS j oen ,                        PBS l nodes1ppn1n ,                        PBS l walltime50000n ,                        cd PBSOWORKDIRn ,                        n ,                        .xanalyse.py sn  datafilename  .pkl ]       file.close      os.systemqsub s  jobname  .sub       time.sleep2. codepre  pThe script prepares a set of data to be analysed, saves it to a file, writes a pbs submit file for analysing this set of data, submits the job to do it, and then moves onto doing the same again with the next set of data, and so on.  p  pAs it is, when the script is run, a list of job ids are printed to the standard output as the jobs are submitted.  ls shows that there are N .sub files and N .pkl data files. qstat shows that all the jobs are running, with the status R, and are then completed, with the status C.  However, afterwards, ls shows that there are fewer than N .out output files, and fewer than N result files produced by xanalyse.py.  In effect, no output are produced by some of the jobs.  If I were to clear everything, and rerun the above script, I would get the same behaviour, with some jobs but not necessary the same ones as last time not producing any output.  p  pIt has been suggested that by increasing the waiting time between the submission of consecutive jobs, things improve.  p  precodetime.sleep10. or some other waiting time codepre  pBut I feel this is not most satisfactory, because I have tried 0.1s, 0.5s, 1.0s, 2.0s, 3.0s, none of which really helped.

Stale NFS file handlein the post job file processing.  By submitting hundreds of test jobs, I have been able to identify a number of nodes that produce failed jobs.  By codesshcodeing onto these, I can find the missing PBS output files in codevarspooltorquespoolcode, where I can also see output files belonging to other users.  One strange thing about these problematic nodes is that if they are the only node chosen to be used, the job runs fine on them.  The problem only arises when they are mixed with other nodes.  p  pSince I do not know how to fix the post job processing Stale NFS file handle, I avoid these nodes by submitting dummy jobs to themp  precodeecho sleep 60  qsub lnodesbadnode1ppn2badnode2ppn2 codepre  pbefore submitting the real jobs.  Now all jobs produce output as expected, and there is no need to wait before consecutive submissions.p

Negative 1972 pWe usually do feature development on new branches and then bugfixes on the master branch. This time, for some reason, one of the feature branches had a leak where it was merged back into master when it shouldnt have.p  pFrom the screenshot, you can see that we have the feature branches smsopen and 121217. 121217 was supposed to be merged into master after our sprint and then the smsopen branch had a longer time estimate so it needed to be pushed back in a future release. I cannot figure out why smsopen commit 609129d was merged back in. I see the unwanted merge happening at 75e845b, but the developer who did this denies that smsopen was being merged back.

Negative 1972 pOk, I read lots of answers in stackoverflow and the net, none of them helped me.p  pThe problem started with git version Git1.7.10preview20120409 and tortoiseGit TortoiseGit1.7.10.064bit later on I upgraded to Git1.8.0preview20121022 and tortoiseGit 1.7.15, I was hoping it will solve my problemp  pIm working with git for few months now almost only through the tortoiseGit. Most of the work I done till now is having few repositories hosted on Assembla and each one have few branches and Im doing mostly common stuff. p  pToday I tried to add an open source submodule to the project, it went fine but then I decided to go with the subtree approach. Till that point i didnt commit anything to the locals branches and I didnt push anything to my remote server. Since I didnt see any easy was to remove the submodule, I tried to revert my branch to the last known commit, it didnt really work, so I deleted the .gitmodules file and the relevant section from the config file and the submodule folder. Since stuff still werent working exactly, I decided to delete the whole repository from my local machine and to clone it again. I thought that since I didnt commit anything nor pushed I would be OK. But after the clone finish with success and I press on the OK button I get the following message emFail set config remote.origin.puttykeyfileem After pressing OK almost nothing is working, so I tried to change the settings like this in the reop folder right clickTortoiseGitSettingsgitRemote and Im getting the following error fatal emNot a git repository ...gitmodulesthirdPartyNameem. Of course the specified folder is not even exist, I tried to create it manually and running the emgit initem command on that folder, still didnt help me.p  pNothing I read helped me to solve my problem, so I upgraded GIT and I removed tortoiseGit and installed a new version. I still have the same problems, I think that the problem is related to the fact that tortoiseGit doesnt clean the settings when you uninstall it.p  pWith the new versions of git and tortoiseGit I get almost the same errors. emCould not initialize libgit. libgit reports Not a git repository ...gitmodulesthirdPartyemp  pNow my situation is that all my repositories on my computer doesnt work. Im almost sure that it is something with the setting of git or tortoiseGit since it doesnt work with other unrelated repositories also.p  pI would really appreciate help,p  pThanksp  pEDIT It looks like GIT is working fine from the command line, so I assume that the problem is with tortoiseGitp
Negative 1972 pIm working on writing a scrapy pipeline that will call a function to clear our cdns edge servers of the scraped urls. I figured out how to store the list of visited urls easily enough, but the issue is knowing when the crawler is done.p  pThe cdns api takes urls in batches of 100, so I can easily call its clear function every 100 urls, but if there are 543 urls to crawl the last 43 wont get sent to the cdns clear function.p  pIve been looking at the scrapy signal documentation, but I cant figure out ifp  ol lithe spiderclosed signal is called when the last request is received or when all item are through the pipeline. If its the latter, its too late to know to call the api with the last 43 urlsli lithe other option would be to add an extension that calls the cdns api when it receives the spiderclosed signal, but how does it know all the urls that the spider has seen I can build a list of them in the item pipeline, but how to get that to the extension I could maybe use the itemscraped signal, which just occurred to me.li ol  pSo yeah, is there a way to know, inside the pipeline, when the are no more items coming And are there multiple pipelines running concurrently, or is each pipeline a singletonp

Negative 1972 pI am writing a java sound application that transitions linearly from one frequency to another.p  pWhen I input a constant frequency aka the first and last frequency are the same, the correct frequency is played.p  pHowever, whenever the difference between the two frequencies is greater than zero, the frequency played starts at the correct value, but bincrements at double the rate, and ends up at double the difference.b e.g. I input 500 and 1000 the frequency starts at 500 and ends at 1500.p  pI originally thought that I was simply incorrectly incrementing the frequency, but when I print the frequency values, it prints the values I had intended e.g. I input 500 and 1000 the printed output starts at 500 and ends at 1000.p  pI checked the value of the audible frequency by recording the output sound and looking at its frequency on a frequency spectrogram. Here is the relevant simplified part of my codep  precodeimport java.lang.Math import javax.sound.sampled.  public class MainSpeech   public static void mainString[] args throws LineUnavailableException       double freq   frequency in Hz     int volume  30     int time  1  in seconds     float sampleRate  8000.0f  in Hz     int numSamples  intsampleRate  time   of samples within given time     byte stream[]  new byte[intsampleRate1]  waveform values      freq  700     for int i  0 i lt numSamples i          freq  0.1         stream[i]  byte Math.sin2Math.PIifreqsampleRatevolume           AudioFormat af  new AudioFormatsampleRate, 8, 1, true, false     SourceDataLine sdl  AudioSystem.getSourceDataLineaf     sdl.openaf     sdl.start     sdl.writestream, 0, stream.length  play sound     sdl.drain     sdl.close   codepre  pIn this simplified snippet, the frequency should start at 700, and increase eight thousand times by 0.1, ending at a frequency of 1500, which a printout correctly displays. However the audible frequency actually ends at 2300.p

Negative 1972 pI am trying to do some experiments on the Trinamic a hrefhttpwww.trinamic.comindex.phpoptioncomcontentampviewarticleampid541ampItemid434 relnofollowStepRockera Stepper Motor Controller in GnuLinux. I had attahched the device through USB to a Windows machine previously and used Trinamics a hrefhttpwww.trinamic.comindex.phpoptioncomcontentampviewarticleampid303 relnofollowproprietary softwarea to test if the controller is functional as expected, and it seems to be. The beginners manual of the StepRocker mentions certain commands that should be sent over the serial interface to rotate the motor left, right, or bring it to a halt. But when I connect this controller over USB to a GnuLinux computer, and want to write my own C libusb program to make the motor move, I am not quite sure what my starting point should be. The console application which I plan to write should be nonblocking.p  pHere is an image of the datagrams being sent and response received while a rotate command is issuedp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comX3yg4.png altenter image description herep  pI tried to write a simple program to feed the rotation value datagram shown in the picture to the motor controllerp  precodeinclude ltstdio.hgt include ltstring.hgt include ltfcntl.hgt include lterrno.hgt include lttermios.hgt include ltunistd.hgt  int fd1 int wr int main      fd1opendevttyACM0, ORDWR  ONOCTTY  ONDELAY     if fd1  1           perroropenport Unable to open devttyACM0          else          fcntlfd1, FSETFL,0     printfPort 1 has been sucessfully opened and d is the file descriptionn,fd1     char moveMsg[9]0x01,0x01, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x02, 0xbc, 0xc0     wr  writefd1, moveMsg, 9          closefd1     return 0  codepre  pBut this does not alter the LED behaviour of the controller in any way and does not move the motor, of course.p

Negative 1972 pIm having trouble with jQuery.  Im new and have been working on implementing a jQuery accordion into my website.  At first, everything seems fine, the accordion opens correctly, looks great, but things go awry when I try to click the next topic below the one currently open.  The stranger part is it ONLY happens when you try to open the accordion piece below what youre currently on, but when you open the one above it, there are no problems at all.  The problem being that it has no scrollbar once you click one, click a second one, they become blank and the entire accordion freezes.  It almost seems theres a problem loading the content, because it can return to normal after a good amount of time.  There doesnt seem to be any problems with the JavaScript that it registers at least, both checks pass, but this problem persists.br br Javascriptp  precode document.ready function           blog.accordion             heightStyle fill,             activetrue                  console.logdocument.ready is working          console.logJavaScript working codepre  pHTMLp  precodeltDOCTYPE htmlgt lthtml langengt     ltheadgt         ltmeta charsetutf8 gt         lttitlegt[title]lttitlegt         ltlink relstylesheet typetextcss hrefCSSjqueryui.css gt         ltlink relstylesheet typetextcss hrefCSSmain.css gt         ltscript srchttpcode.jquery.comjquery1.9.1.jsgtltscriptgt         ltscript srchttpcode.jquery.comui1.10.1jqueryui.jsgtltscriptgt         ltscript srcJavaScriptmain.jsgtltscriptgt     ltheadgt     ltbodygt         ltdiv idcontainergt             ltBANNERgt             ltdiv classbannergt                 lth1gtlta hrefdefault.phpgt[name]ltagtlth1gt             ltdivgt             ltNAVIGATIONgt             ltdiv classnavigationgt                 ltulgt                     [links and navigation]                 ltulgt                ltdivgt             ltMAIN CONTENTgt             ltdiv idcontentgt             lth1gtThe Bloglth1gt                 ltdiv idbloggt                     lth4gtBlog 1lth4gt                     ltdivgt                         ltpgt                             [blog 1 material]                         ltpgt                     ltdivgt                     lth4gtBlog 2lth4gt                     ltdivgt                         ltpgt                             [blog 2 material]                         ltpgt                     ltdivgt                     lth4gtBlog 3lth4gt                     ltdivgt                         ltpgt                             [blog 3 material]                         ltpgt                     ltdivgt                 ltdivgt             ltdivgt             ltFOOTERgt             ltdiv classfootergt                 ltpgt[footer stuff]ltpgt             ltdivgt         ltdivgt     ltbodygt lthtmlgt codepre  pbr As a final note, the problem only seems to happen with the fill option.

Negative 1972 pIm currently investigating how we should perform our testing in an upcoming project. In order to find bugs early in the development process, the developers will write unit tests before the actual code TDDish. The unit tests will focus, as they should, on the unit a method in this case in isolation so dependencies will be mocked etc etc.p  pNow, I also would like to test these units when they interact with other units and I was thinking that there should be a effective best practice to do this since the unit tests have already been written. My thought is that the unit tests will be reused but the mocked objects will be removed and replaced with real ones. The diffent ideas I have right now isp  ul liUse a global flag in each test class that decides if mock objects should be used or not. This approach will require several codeifcode statementsli liUse a factory class that either creates a instanceWithMocks or instanceWithoutMocks. This approach might be troublesome for the new developers to use and requires some extra classesli liSeparate the integration tests from the unit tests in different classes. This will however require a lot of redundant code and maintaining the test cases will be twice the workli ul  pThe way I see it all of these approaches have pros and cons. Which of these would be preferred and why And is there a better way to effective transition from unit testing to integration testing Or is this usually done in some other wayp

Negative 1972 pThe argument for using both client side validation JavaScript and server side validation using a validator is this If the client browser does not support JavaScript, then the user cannot use client side validation.  br br My question is how good is this argument in practice In theory it makes sense, but in practice, if JavaScript is disabled in the browser, then most website features will not even work.

Negative 1972 pI encountered a strange problem while writing a prototype for an architecture.p  pI tried to create two threads that dispatch the same commands independently. The first thread was to use a codeScannercode and the second one to rely on Swing. The problem was that the first thread prevented the second thread from starting. The second thread started only after the scanner was given enough input. Forcing the first thread sleep until the second thread started also fixed the problem temporarily.p  pThe following example reproduces this behavior quite consistently. Sleeping between the calls makes it even more consistent.p  precodeimport java.awt.BorderLayout import java.awt.EventQueue import java.awt.event.ActionEvent import java.awt.event.ActionListener import java.util.Scanner  import javax.swing.JButton import javax.swing.JFrame import javax.swing.WindowConstants  public final class Bug      public static void mainfinal String[] arguments          new Threadnew Runnable              Override             public void run                  System.out.printlnThe commands are wait and quit.                 final Scanner scanner  new ScannerSystem.in                 loop while true                      System.out.printEnter a command                      final String command  scanner.nextLine                     switch command.toLowerCase                      case exit                     case quit                         break loop                     default                         System.out.printlnUse wait or quit instead of   command  .                     case wait                                                       scanner.close                      .start          try              Thread.sleep1000improves consistency                  catch final InterruptedException exception           EventQueue.invokeLaternew Runnable              Override             public void run                  final JFrame frame  new JFrameCommands                 frame.setDefaultCloseOperationWindowConstants.DISPOSEONCLOSE                 frame.setResizablefalse                 frame.setLayoutnew BorderLayout                 frame.addnew JButtonWait, BorderLayout.LINESTART                 final JButton button  new JButtonQuit                 button.addActionListenernew ActionListener                      Override                     public void actionPerformedfinal ActionEvent event                          frame.dispose                                                       frame.addbutton, BorderLayout.LINEEND                 frame.pack                 frame.setVisibletrue                             codepre  pWhy doesnt the second thread start properly Am I to blamep  pA a hrefhttpbugs.sun.combugdatabaseviewbug.dobugid4206767 relnofollowsimilar problema was submitted as a bug over ten years ago.p  hr  pRunning codejava versioncode results inp  precodejava version 1.7.021 JavaTM SE Runtime Environment build 1.7.021b11 Java HotSpotTM Client VM build 23.21b01, mixed mode, sharing codepre  pand codecmd infocode inp  precodeMicrosoft Windows XP [Version 5.1.2600] C Copyright 19852001 Microsoft Corp. codepre  pif that matters.p

Negative 1972 pIn my project, we have 2 REST calls which take too much time, so we are planning to optimize that. Here is how it works currently  we make 1st call to system A and then pass the response to system B for further processing. Once we get the response from system B, we have to manipulate it further before passing it to UI layer and this entire process takes lot of time. We planned on using SolrLucene but since we are not the data owners, we cant implement that. Can someone please shed some light on how best this can be handled We are using Spring MVC and Spring webflow. Thanks in advancep  p[EDIT] This is not the actual scenario and I am writing this as an example for better understanding. Think of this as making a store locator call for a particular zip to get a list of 100 stores and then sending those 100 stores to another call to get a list of inventory etc. So, this list of stores would change for every zip code and also the inventory there.p

Negative 1972 pWe are implementing an online interface to connect to the ORACLE DB and allow users to do queries online. We came accross of XMLTYPE datatype in oracle and facing difficulties with it. To retrieve the DATA from a table which has XMLTYPE in it, a normal select  from tablename wouldnt work but we need to call that specific column with xmltype.getclobvalcolumnname.  This would be a nice option if we handle queries from backend, but here we are allowing users to do query on their own. In this case users will just do a select  on that table but still I need to be able to fetch the data and display irrespective of whether it has XMLTYPE or not. Is there any way of doing it using native PHP Oracle drivers itself Or do we need to write a plugin which handles this without notifying users that we are applying xmltype.getclobval function in backendp  h2Please help me in this aspect.h2  pThanks, Lalithp

Negative 1972 pI guess this is a 2 part question but Ill start by explaining the problem Im having. p  pI have an Angular project, and 3 classes, which are not part of the Angular framework. The first question  is whether its recommended to pull an instance of Angular within one of those classes, just to grab certain data from a singleton service.p  pAnd second  is there a way to incorporate these classes more deeply into the Angular framework. I dont want to create them as services, because they are not meant to be singletons.p  pIts just frustrating, because its so easy to grab a service within Angular  ie. just passing its reference to a controller. With the external external to the Angular framework classobject, there is no reference I can pass. And the classobject in question, is not being calledinitialized from within Angular, so I cant just pass the service reference directly.p  pIdeasp

For example, a search for Sample example3 within 5000 meters of 9.8765.432.p  pIn such a search, documents with more tag matches and matches against the title should rank higher which I believe Sphinx does by default, while still considering tag weights which makes it possible that a certain tag may cause the document to rank very high in the search because of its weight.p  pIve used Sphinx in the past to perform both fulltext and geospatial search separately, but I need some help to design an index that can do both efficiently. Any advice is greatly appreciatedp

Negative 1972 pI need to develop an application that will allow devices to communicate from time to time one device sends a simple message, another one sends a response.p  pThis communication is not going to happen too often once in several minutes, so it does not seem to be reasonable to keep a permanent connection between the devices. Besides, the connection may be lost for some reason, so Im going to need a some sort of the recovery logic. p  pInstead, Id prefer the app to establish a new connection each time it needs to send data to a peer. However, the specs say, that after codeBluetoothServerSocket.acceptcode returns, the server socket should be closed. This means that the app will no longer be able to receive the subsequent incoming connections.p  pCurrently Im thinking of not closing the server socket and processing the incoming connections in a synchronous manner, so that the app will not try to accept a new connection until the previous one is processed and closed. What will happen if another peer tries to connect in the middle of such processing Will it fail or just block until server is ready to accept itp

Negative 1972 pSo Ive written a few comprehensive scripts using codebashcode and codeshcode, but only a couple of small java programs.  Ive read a couple of java books and just feel like it isnt sticking.  I find C and C easier to grasp for some odd reason and then scripting to just be immensely more simple.p  pOne of the big gaps in my understanding between scripting and programming is understanding how programs are processed.  For example, in a script, I can do the followingp  precodebinsh  varmy variable  echo var codepre  pObviously this will print codemy variablecode.  I understand that this basically works as if I typed this into the shell as commands with codeechocode being the command and codevarcode being the argument to codeechocode and the script just processes these commends sequentualy.  But if I do this in javap  precodeString var  my variable System.out.printlnvar codepre  pWhat is the difference in how the computer is processing the commands or are these even commands  For the first line, is codeStringcode a command to the jvm and codevarcode the argument  p  pI understand that these are differences in syntax and I understand how that code works, but under the hood, what is the difference between how a shell script processes commands versus the jvm  Or am I looking at this totally wrongp

Negative 1972 pI have two models codeUsercode and codeWantcode. A codeUsercode codehasmanycode codeWantcodes.p  pThe codeWantcode model has a single property besides codeuseridcode, thats codenamecode.p  pIn the codeeditcode action view in the codeUsersControllercode there are two forms. One POSTs PUT to the codeUsersControllercode update method to update the user, another POSTs to the codeWantsControllercode codecreatecode action to add a new codeWantcode to the users account.p  pThis is fine and I have it working, but...p  pIn the codecreatecode action of the codeWantsControllercode I redirect back to the codeeditcode action of the codeUsersControllercode to show success or codeWantcode validation errors.p  pThe issue is that the edit action creates a new want for the form and the validation errors are lost in the request.p  pCheck out the codecreatecode action in the codeUsersControllercodep  precodedef create     want  currentuser.wants.buildparams[want]     if want.save       flash[success]  WANT created       redirectto useraccountpath currentuser.username     else       flash[validation]  want.errors lt I NEED THESE ERRORS FOR MY VIEW       redirectto useraccountpath currentuser.username     end   end codepre  pand the edit action of the codeUsersControllercodep  precodedef edit   want  user.wants.build   super end codepre  pBecause the codeWantsControllercode redirects I lose the errors in the codewantcode instance variable. I can store the errors in the codeflashcode as shown in the comment but surely this is a complete misuse of the codeflashcode.p  pSo my question is, how can I persist those errors accross the action so I can render in my view the codeWantcode validation errorsp  pAlso, is this considered a validation of Rails conventions Seems a bit overkill to create a whole new page so a user can add a single want with one string propertyp  pThanks.p

Negative 1972 pIn my database I have a table containing records with their own primary id key and a user id key. Client side, in my javascript, I have an array full of many many user ids. For each id in this array, I wish to search and select the records in the table with the matching user id associated. Im not sure if I have the best, most efficient method of doing so. p  pRight now, this is what I am thinkingp  pstrongSemipsuedo codestrongp  pstrongJavascriptstrongp  precodefor each element user id in array       .get script.php, useriddata, functionresponse               ..do something with the rowrecord data of that specific user...             codepre  pSo for each user id in that array, I perform an AJAX get request, sending that specific user id to a php script which searches the entire table for a recordrow with a user id match. p  pstrongPHPMySQL script.phpstrongp  precode..some connection code.. .. some receive code..  query code    SELECT  FROM recordTable WHERE userid  .varcontaininguserid.  ...some array to json encoding..  return attribute data           codepre  pHowever, though this is the only way I can think of, this just does not seem to be the most efficient way right now to me. p  pThis is because, theoretically, both the array of user ids and the number of records could be infinitely many or just a lot in the future.

Negative 1972 pIm developing a app using Storyboards. In one ViewController I have a button on navigationBar that links to the second ViewController.

This makes no sense since I already have defined it on the storyboard, so I think that must be another solution.p
Negative 1972 pI know this question gets asked a hundred times over, and Ive scoured all of the possibilities, but I guess Im not adept enough to know where this problem lies. Im programming a program where I need to fill a struct with data ints and strings. The first time I tried it it skipped over everything but the first one, but I didnt panic since I remembered from class I needed to use codefflushstdincode to overcome this.

The app plays a sound, loads the description, and shows a picture of the car. Originally, I was using a PLIST file to store this information.

However, I am no longer implementing the PLIST file, since it would be much easier for the program to automatically generate this data at runtime, based on the folders in the project.p  pThe folders are broken down as follows Main Resources Folder  Makes  Models  Years  Folder containing picture, .mp3, and file with descriptionp  pFor example Cars  Ford  Mustang  1965  Pic, .mp3, description in filep  precode    Go to folder     NSString  resourcePath  [[NSBundle mainBundle] resourcePath]     NSString  documentsPath  [resourcePath stringByAppendingPathComponentCars]     NSError error     Load names of all makes in folder into memory     NSArray  listOfMakes  [[NSFileManager defaultManager] contentsOfDirectoryAtPathdocumentsPath erroramperror] codepre  pI then use multiple for loops to iterate through this and all other folders, and to load everything else in to NSArrays.p  pHowever, I need one single array that is accessible programwide.  So, I am doing this within a singleton.  I would like to add these arrays to an NSMutableArray, so that I can access it anywhere.  I have viewed many other questions, like these   a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions5896608objectivecaccessingarraysobjectivec accessing arraysa, a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions11520415addingobjectsinmultidimensionalnsmutablearrayAdding objects in Multidimensional NSMutableArraya, a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions13834390howtoaddstringobjectstonsmutablearrayHow to add string objects to NSMutableArraya, But am still very confused since these only cover up to three dimensions.

Negative 1972 pAdobe Acrobat has the option to lock the PDF document after signing it. This changes the document permissions so that Acrobat does not offer signing the document again or modifying annotations or forms. This seems like a reasonable action to do after a document has been signed for review by multiple entities and finally for release by someone responsible.p  piTextSharp can also sign documents, and it can also add further signatures to an already signed document. iTextSharp basically also can set the documents permissions, but somehow I cant get it to set the same permissions as Acrobat X Pro does. I set the following permissionsp  ul liPdfWriter.ALLOWCOPYli liPdfWriter.ALLOWDEGRADEDPRINTINGli liPdfWriter.ALLOWPRINTINGli liPdfWriter.ALLOWSCREENREADERSli ul  pI do not set the following permissions which should be all elsep  ul liPdfWriter.ALLOWASSEMBLYli liPdfWriter.ALLOWFILLINli liPdfWriter.ALLOWMODIFYANNOTATIONSli liPdfWriter.ALLOWMODIFYCONTENTSli ul  pAnyway, after saving a document like that, I see the following permissions in Acrobat X Prop  ul liPrinting Allowed OKli liModifying document Not allowed OKli liAssembly Not allowed OKli liCopy contents Allowed OKli liScreen reader Allowed OKli liRemove pages Allowed NOT OKli liAnnotate Allowed NOT OKli liFill in forms Allowed NOT OKli liSign Allowed NOT OKli liCreate templates Allowed unknownli ul  pIm not using encryption because that is only possible before putting the first signature. Also, I dont really want to use it because a its basically useless without a viewer password and b Acrobat doesnt do it either when locking a document after signing.p  pMy code is based on the iSafePDF project opensource on Codeplex which is using PdfStamper in some way on an existing document.p  pMy iTextSharp version is 5.2.1. The latest version has incompatible API changes that I didnt resolve yet.p  pSo how can I achieve the same result as with Acrobatp  pIm aware that my application will still be able to sign the document because it doesnt care for the existing permissions. But at least other Acrobat users should see the intended permissions correctly.p  pstrongUpdatestrongp  pI have further investigated the issue and it seems to come from here The permissions can only be set through the PdfStamper.SetEncryption method, as its 4th parameter. But calling this method together with appending a signature leads to the following DocumentException Append mode does not support changing the encryption status. I havent seen a method that sets permissions but not encryption. Is this the problem Does iTextSharp simply not support whats actually possiblep

Negative 1972 pIm trying to figure out what the most appropriate way to retrieve content either a hash or string from a set of ids. p  pThe redis documentation talks about a tagging system a hrefhttpwww.rediscookbook.orgimplementtagsandsearchthem.html relnofollowherea in which sets are used to filter down books, but does not mention how you would then get information about a book. You could obviously use mget with a list of ids once youve filtered down the the ids, but this only really works if youre working with String values and not hashes. It also means that you need to return the ids back to your application code and convert id to bookid. Is there a better way to do thisp
Negative 1972 pI guess the title is slightly confusing but I will try and clarify what I mean by that. Below I have attached my make file. As you can see on the fourth line I am selecting all the libraries I want my project to link against.p  pWhen the project compiles I see that for every object file it is creating it is linking with all the libraries specified with the LIBRA line. Not all of those libraries are required by all the files in my project. Perhaps just one or two use across each .cpp file. p  pDoes this produce any additional cost to the compilation process Does this create a larger binary Are modern compilers good enough that this is not a problem or do I have to read some more literature on compilersp  precodeCCg CFLAGSc Wall stdc11 g  LDFLAGSldl LIBRA lboostsystem lboostfilesystem lboostthread lsigarx8664linux ldl lsqlite3 LIBBLhometensaiSIGARlib Lusrinclude Lusrlocallib SOURCESmain.cpp configreader.cpp databasemanager.cpp monitoragent.cpp analyzeagent.cpp OBJECTSSOURCES.cpp.o EXECUTABLElnmp INCLUDES  IhometensaiSIGAR  all SOURCES EXECUTABLE  EXECUTABLE OBJECTS      CC LDFLAGS OBJECTS INCLUDES LIBB o  LIBRA  .cpp.o     CC CFLAGS INCLUDES LIBB lt o  LIBRA  clean      rm .o codepre

Negative 1972 pI have two images p  ol lia circleli lia small triangle placed on top of the circle.li ol  pThese two  images are placed inside a fragment.  I have a touch listener for the triangle.

Negative 1972 pIm trying to look for an example of code that allows the user to animate a gif on mouseover and pause when mouse out. Ive seen many tutorials talking about this but I want a different effect.p  pI noticed that most gifs reset when on mouse out. That is, either the gif is covered with a generic image or the animation reverts back to the start. What I would like to achieve is a more seamless pause that allows you to start where you left off without using a placeholder image. Similar to the example on this pagep  pa hrefhttpwww.valhead.com20130311animationplaystate relnofollowhttpwww.valhead.com20130311animationplaystateap  pNotice how when you put the mouse over the image, the animation just pauses without replacing anything, and resumes otherwise.p  pI dont know if its possible with a gif because this example is using basic css shapes, but there has to be some way to pause the gif on mouse out and resume on mouse over without covering the image on a looping animation If not is there a way to use a movie file that pauses on mouse over and plays where it left off when you put the mouse over itp  pThanksp  pEDIT Thanks to brbcoding and his genius, this issue was solved Details on the solution can be found either in the posts below or on his blog post a hrefhttpcodyhenshaw.comblog20131217fauxanimatedgifswithcss3keyframes relnofollowhttpcodyhenshaw.comblog20131217fauxanimatedgifswithcss3keyframesap

Negative 1972 pI have an ASP.NET app that uses the Membership provider. I just copied the app and associated database to a new server, and now I cant log into it. Ive confirmed the database connection string is correct and that the app can talk to the database  the problem is with the Membership provider somewhere.p  pOn both servers the app is set to use ASP.NET 4.0 the old server is running IIS 7.0, and the new is IIS 7.5. The app was copied over using the Web Deploy tool, so its identical on both servers.p  pAfter reading a hrefhttpweblogs.asp.netscottguarchive20060422Alwayssetthe2200applicationName2200propertywhenconfiguringASP.NET2.0MembershipandotherProviders.aspx relnofollowthis blog posta  which seems to describe the problem exactly and indicates the issue could be due to the codeapplicationNamecode attribute being set differently on each server  I checked on the old and new server, and confirmed that the codeapplicationNamecode in config was set to the same value  on both servers  heres the full config entry under codeltmembershipgtcodep  precodeltadd nameAspNetSqlMembershipProvider   typeSystem.Web.Security.SqlMembershipProvider  connectionStringNameDefault  enablePasswordRetrievalfalse  enablePasswordResettrue  requiresQuestionAndAnswerfalse  requiresUniqueEmailfalse  maxInvalidPasswordAttempts5  minRequiredPasswordLength6  minRequiredNonalphanumericCharacters0  passwordAttemptWindow10  applicationName gt codepre  pI also checked in the aspnetApplications table, and there is a single record with ApplicationName and LoweredApplicationName  so the codeapplicationNamecode value from the config file is being honoured.p  pMy next thought was that somehow the passwords are being encrypted using the machineKey for the old server, which is different to the machineKey on the new server. However, as you can see in the above config entry, the codepasswordFormatcode key is not set in config on either server. I couldnt find any documentation to indicate the default value of this attribute, but on the database table aspnetMembership, every record has codePasswordFormatcode set to 1, which a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibraryaa478949.aspx relnofollowaccording to this pagea indicates the passwords are hashed, and not encrypted.p  pNevertheless, I investigated whether I could copy the machineKey from one server to another  but the old server is set to AutoGenerate, so I dont know if this is even possible. And if it is, I dont think itll help as AFAIK the machineKey isnt involved in hashing.p  pOne last thing  the app that handles this is in a subfolder of another app. I dont think that makes any difference but I thought Id mention it. The child app is not set to be an application in IIS, its just a folder.p  pAll in all, Im not sure how to proceed. As far as I can tell the app on both servers is hashing the passwords, not encrypting them, and so it should just move across fine. Id appreciate any advice on what to check .p

Negative 1972 pI am developing an application on codeiOScode and codeAndroidcode. The application uses Bluetooth standard Bluetooth not BLE to sendreceive information. It may not be of relevance but for reference my current test device is a Nexus 5. p  pThe application is built with codeCordovacode or codePhoneGapcode so the UI is HTML5JavaScriptcss and the Bluetooth plugin is written in native Java for Android, ObjC for iOS. Futhermore the UI was created with the help of codeBootstrapcode, codejQuerycode, codeBackbone.jscode and codeUnderscore.jscode.  p  pMy question is regarding the management of the Bluetooth data coming in. I havent developed it yet, but I wish to have a Bluetooth listener service running, that will be able to perform calculations on the Bluetooth data being received. Before start, I kind of wanted to get an idea of my options and an idea of what the best method of attack would be. I could write a plugin to manage the data received, so that the data would be dealt with by native code which to my knowledge would run smoother. p  pHowever, since my application is multiplatform currently only iOS and Android but possibly more platform in the future it makes more sense to me trying to tackle the data calculations without using pluginsnative. Would it be feasible to attempt this in JavaScript Ive heard it can be quite laggy and cause timing issues within CordovaPhoneGap applications when you increase the complexity. p  pDoes anyone have any experience with this and may be able to shed some light It would be most appreciated.  p  pThanks.p
Negative 1972 pI made a rhythm game for iOS that has sold quite well and would like to port it to Android. Apportable seemed like a great option and the conversion mostly worked. However, the main gameplay relies on AVAudioPlayer currentTime property to display music notes in time with the song, which the Android equivalent lags horribly currentTime is only updated around every 1 second.p  pThe Apportable forums suggested using CoreAudioAudio Units or openAL instead. I found a thin wrapper called Novocaine which seemed like the perfect solution, but the Accelerate framework has not been implemented yet. ObjectAL seemed promising but the AudioPlayer is just a thin wrapper for AVAudioPlayer...p  pBasically, Im looking for the easiest way to play compressed audio on iOS that completely avoids AVAudioPlayer and the Accelerate framework possible other unimplemented Frameworks.... I just need to play a song and get its current time in milliseconds nothing more so Im hesitating on spending the days weeks it will take to learn CoreAudio to do what I want.p  pThanksp
Negative 1972 pI have a webpage which refreshes every 5 minutes with client details.

So no go until I fill the details.p  pIs there a way I can keep a file with a php or a javascript or jquery code so it can feed the username password to that and open the webpage even as a iframep  pNo need to worry about the safety of the file  the PC is locked in a cabinet with only a small set of holes for ventilation and for the display cable coming out to the monitor and another small hole to reach the power button.p  pIf you know to do this on android let me know as well.p  pstrongFound the answer See my post belowstrongp

Negative 1972 pI am using Swipebox through the responsive lightbox plugin and the bar with close button at the bottom gets covered by the iPhone bottom nav so you cant close the enlargements. I tried adding padding in css, but it doesnt seem to work. I love the way that swipebox works and looks, but it may not be an option for me if you cant close the enlargements on the iPhone.p  pWhen you touch the bottom area on iPhone it evokes this bottom iPhone nag which covers the swipebox close button. I would think the solution would be to either swap the top caption bar of the swipe box with the bottom bar that closes it, or to move the bottom bar up so it would not be covered. If I switch from landscape to portrait a couple of times it does move upon its own. I have no idea why.p  pWhen I test the jQuery plugin at the swipebox site it does the same thing. So I am asking if anyone has modified this successfully.p

Negative 1972 pSorry for the long back story but I wanted to give a good idea of why were doing what were doing.p  pOur application currently uses Hibernate 3.6 and we wish to upgrade to Hibernate 4.3.p  pThe application was specifically written to avoid using codepersistence.xmlcode to configure JPA and create the codeEntityManagerFactorycode and instead uses Hibernates codeEjb3Configurationcode class like this examplep  precodeProperties properties  new Properties properties.putjavax.persistence.provider, org.hibernate.ejb.HibernatePersistence properties.putjavax.persistence.transactionType, RESOURCELOCAL properties.puthibernate.dialect, org.hibernate.dialect.Oracle10gDialect properties.puthibernate.showsql, false properties.puthibernate.formatsql, true  Ejb3Configuration cfg  new Ejb3Configuration cfg.addPropertiesproperties  DataSource dataSource  dataSourceProvider.get cfg.setDataSourcedataSource  add the annotated classes cfg.addAnnotatedClassSomePersistentObject.class  EntityManagerFactory factory  cfg.buildEntityManagerFactory codepre  pThe reason we do it this way is because we have a web app war file deployed to Tomcat that provides core functionality.  Then, we install what we call client bundles which are jar files in the exploded codeWEBINFlibcode directory.  The client bundles contain overrides to the existing core behavior of the web app.  This allows us to service multiple clients, each with various customizations from the core behavior, in one instance of the web app.  We know which client bundle to use based on the domain or subdomain of the incoming HTTP request.p  pEach client bundle always gets its own database instance, and thus each client bundle defines its own codeEntityManagerFactorycode.  The schemas are almost identical, although client bundles can add new persistent classes if needed.p  pSo, the reason we do JPA configuration in Java is so that each client bundle extend the core classes and add their own entity classes.  Java is great for inheritance while XML stinks.  If we have to configure via XML, then each client bundle would need to copy the cores codepersistence.xmlcode and update it from there. I would much rather use inheritance over copypaste.p  pI think we have a pretty valid use case for preferring JPA configuration via Java rather than XML.  p  pMy question  Does Hibernate 4.3 allow this in any way  If so, how can I go about itp  pIf not, does anybody have any suggestions on how to make my above scenario as easy as possible while being stuck with XML configuration  p  pCan multiple jar files within a single web app contain codeMETAINFpersistence.xmlcode files, or do multiple persistence units need to be defined another wayp  pThank youp  pRyanp

So no extra memory is allocated here, right  But then, is the codeFoocode class responsible for providing a destructor that deallocates codemyDatacodes memory  Or do we have a dynamic array pointer that actually points to stack memoryp  pAlso, if I want to protect codeFoocodes codemyDatacode from changing when codemainDatacode is changed, is there a simple way to force the codeFoocode constructor to copy it  Ideally codemyDatacode would be a simple array, not a pointer, but changing the line codedouble myDatacode to codedouble myData[]code doesnt seem to work because the size of the array is unknown until runtime.p

Negative 1972 pI have to create a backend page in symfony that is expected to produce a table with several thousands of lines. p  pI know that normally this is not nice, but in this case I cant add paging buttons and similar stuff because this page is used as a way to export data outside from the website in other words, it doesnt matter if it takes minutes to be rendered, but when visible this page has to contain ALL the data I need. I will then take care of potential security issues by restricting this page to the only user allowed to access it.p  pHowever, if I rely on the usual symfony MVC structure, I get out of memory errors simply because I need to store all the data in a buffer before sending it to the twig template.p  pDo you know if it exists a simple way to render this page without incurring in memory exaustion issues In plain PHP I would have simply created an iteration extracting a portion of the results from the query and rendering a portion of the table every time, but can I do something similar by following the symfony Controllertwig Template structurep

Negative 1972 pI have inherited a sql server that is used for generating reports, text file outputs and fixed width files for use and import into other systems.p  pThe developer X did not document or comment a single bit of code. X also used stored procedures, views, SSIS, SQLCMD and every combination in between. X also created multiple databases across the environment to save these views, SPs etc. So we have situations where a SP is opening a view which opens another view that calls SQLCMD at the end of it. Lots of use of RTRIM, REPLACE, STR, CONVERT...Im sure you get the picture... thats the background.p  pI am wanting ideas on the best way to approach, correct and document this environment so that it can be supported.p  pIve started following the query trail, copying the queries into one text file and commenting in Notepad with formatting...then trying to consolidate the query to be efficient and documented.p  pAre there any less time consuming options Im sure many DBAs have gone through this, what is the recommended approachp  pPS.

The problem is that even tough the android tablet has got an SD card inserted, the applicaton keeps creating the directory and later saving the data to the internal storage instead of the external SD card.p  plocalFileSystem.PERSISTENT Should switch to sd card when one is available right When I log   the directory.toURL its saying cdvfilelocalhostpersistentmydirectoryp  pThe native android camera application is saving its images to the SD card which means the SD card is working properly. p  pIm quite lost at this point. After hours of googeling I know the cordova file plugin has recently been updated, and therefore sometimes requires a different approach but Im still stuck and cant seem to find a solution.p  pHope someone can help me. Thanks in advance,p  pMarcop

Negative 1972 pIs it possible to implement the Christofides algorithm for an directed Graph p  pSuppose you have an undirected Graph, in which every vertex has an edges in both ways to every other in the graph not to itself. But the weights of the edges, dont necessarily have do be the same in both ways unsymmetrical.p  pFor Example you think of a Street Map, in which there are a lot of oneway streets.p  pWe now want to find an approximation for the traveling salesman tour through all the vertices.p  pFirst of all the Christoffides algorithm is not defined for such an TSP, because the Minimum Spanning Tree ist not defined for an directed Graph.p  pBut still we start the algorithm by finding the optimum branching with Edmonds algorithm to the start point of the tour as the root.p  pThen we find a minimal perfect matching for the branching, so that it becomes an Eulerian graph. This will happen with the Hungarian algorithm, wich finds an minimal matching so that every vertex in the branching has afterwords the same amount of edges coming in an out.p  pIn the last step we find the euler tour and optimize the tour by taking shortcuts.p  pI have to questionsp  ol liIs the way I want to implement the algorithm right, or did I made a mistake and it cant workli liIf it works, is it still bounded bei 1,5 of the optimal solution for the tspli ol

Negative 1972 pim using Doctrine2 for a project with accounting for the user. So the user object has a collection of account objects.

Negative 1972 pIm creating codeUIViewControllercode that contains a codeUICollectionViewcode this is all setup in the storyboard, delegates and outlets I believe to be correct. In the codeUIViewControllercode I have implemented the following methodsp  precode NSIntegernumberOfSectionsInCollectionViewUICollectionView collectionView   NSIntegercollectionViewUICollectionView collectionView numberOfItemsInSectionNSIntegersection  UICollectionViewCell collectionViewUICollectionView collectionView cellForItemAtIndexPathNSIndexPath indexPath  voidcollectionViewUICollectionView collectionView didSelectItemAtIndexPathNSIndexPath indexPath codepre  pIn addition to the above the storyboard includes a codeUICollectionViewCellcode that is defined in a separate class. This is all working perfectly and the CollectionView is displaying data as expected.p  pBut... I want a create a separate class that implements codeUICollectionViewDataSourcecode, codeUICollectionViewDelegatecode methods and Ive cut and pasted the methods from above that were in the codeUIViewControllercode class into a separate datasource class. Im then setting the UICollectionViews delegate and datasource to point to the new class. This results in the following exception p  precodeTerminating app due to uncaught exception NSInvalidArgumentException, reason UICollectionView must be initialized with a nonnil layout parameter codepre  pI have tried adding the new class as an codeNSObjectcode in the storyboard and connecting the collection view, and also programmatically in the ViewDidLoad method in the ViewController same exception with both. Also the exception is being generated before ViewDidLoad, the ViewController is the root view controller.p  pAm I missing something, googling suggests that the collection view initWithCollectionViewLayout is required but how is this achieved when the CollectionView is being initialized in the StoryBoard and why does it work when its methods are in the ViewController classp  pOne final point this is using xCode 6 Beta 5, in a perfect world Id try this in xCode 5 but Im migrating the data source to Swift.p

Negative 1972 pIs it possible to create a user with username in Chinese or Japanese characters in LinuxUnix I have tried creating a user with nonASCII characters in the username in RedHat and the useradd command does not allow it. But I can create the user by directly copying such username in the etcpasswd file. I am not sure if such usernames are even valid and would work with everything that needs a username. I have tried googling but havent found a definitive answer. Kindly help.p  pThanksp
Negative 1972 pIve just started using Python and MySQL together and Ive noticed that when I store a RegEx string such as coderncode or codecode when I retrieve it  from the database using Python I get coderncode or codecode.

I then decided to print out the value of the colourAttribute found using glGetAttribLocation, and it turns out this was 1. Upon further research I found this a hrefhttpswww.opengl.orgsdkdocsmanhtmlglGetAttribLocation.xhtml relnofollowhttpswww.opengl.orgsdkdocsmanhtmlglGetAttribLocation.xhtmla, which states that the value of 1 is returned If the named attribute variable is not an active attribute in the specified program object.p  pAfter searching Google, I havent found a solution to the problem of the triangle not rendering, so would appreciate any help.p  pThank you.p

Negative 1972 pI m currently investigation the implementation of queues or topic, based on activeMQ within our project. The setup is pretty straight forward in which we are using maven modules to seprate business logic according to the business domain. One common module allows us to assemble common logic.p  psimplified Examplep  ul licommon moduleli liproducts moduleli liclients moduleli ul  pOne of the requirements is that certain operations are asynchronous towards a backend by means of a activeMQ which in turn responds with a result message. The second requirement is that it should be possible to horizontally scale the application by creating a new deployable artifact with only that module that needs more juice. p  pWe are using spring 4 with of course jms and activeMQ.p  pOn to my question. We would like to use just one queue or topic for backend connectivity. Which would mean our common module would handle jms configuration jms factory, jmsconfiguration and different types of messages will be send over that one queuetopic. How would can I make sure that product related messages get handled by the products module and client related messages get handled by the clients module How can I make sure only one of the products modules logic would handle a message if the module was deployed two times What approach would you recommend or is this one queuetopic nuts p  pI was myself thinking in the direction of using a topic because of the publsubsc pattern... , or maybe queue listener acting as publisher in a observer pattern to which product or client subscribers might subscribe to take over handling the messagep  pThanks for your help.p

But I feel this ruins my code by putting .done everywhere. p  pIve been reading up to singleton pattern and feel it might be the solution to my problem, but Im not sure how to implement it. Or maybe implement a callback function in methodToGetProperties, but again not confident as to how.p  pWould kindly appreciate advice on how to organise my app.p

Negative 1972 pSo I understand what the parameters are from reading the documentation, but what I want is more of an intuitive explanation of how they affect the final detector. p  pThe main thing Im trying to grasp is the trade off between numPos, numStages, and maxFalseAlarmRate. This page gives a quick rundown of what the variables actually are.  a hrefhttpdocs.opencv.orgtrunkdocuserguideugtraincascade.html relnofollowhttpdocs.opencv.orgtrunkdocuserguideugtraincascade.htmla p  pSo my first question is dealing with false alarms and stages. What would be the practical difference between a 15 stage detector with a false alarm rate of 0.5 per stage and a 35 stage detector with a false alarm rate of 0.75 per stage Assuming I adjust minHitRate accordingly What are the strengths and drawbacks of either approach Does the number of stages influence the detectors ability to generalize Should I prefer fewer stronger stages, or many more weaker stages, and are there any guidelines for settling on a numberp  pMy second question is regarding numPos. I dont fully understand what this variable does. num is the total number of positive samples I have. Its used to generate pos.vec. It seems to me like during training, opencv starts with a fraction of those samples, and adds a few more at each stage. This creates a pretty frustrating exercise of trial and error, where I might set numPos too high, and training will run out of positive samples before it reaches an acceptable false alarm rate. Then I have to try again with fewer, and see what happens. p  pIf I want to train a big 35 stage detector, I seem to have to start with a pretty low number for numPos. Say, half of my 10000 samples. Am I doing this right The idea of training stages with only half the data seems odd. It might be alright, since that 10000 has been enriched, with noise and brightnesscontrast adjustments, so there is some redundancy in the dataset. Either way, I wanted to ask, and make sure I wasnt doing something wrong, and overtraining my detector or something. p  pLastly, the training program lets me choose the type of boosting used in the classifiers. Theres Discrete Adaboost, Real Adaboost, LogitBoost, and Gentle Adaboost. Gentle is default and I havent really tried any of the others. If anyone has a good understanding of Adaboost, what, generally speaking, is the practical difference between them p  pI should mention, there is pretty substantial variability in the shapes Im trying to detect, so the detectors ability to generalize is of most importance, even if it comes at the cost more false positives. With that in mind, any advice or tips you guys have is greatly appreciated. p  pEdit One more question Does increasing minHitRate reduce the detectors capacity to generalize The way I imagine it, if I were to hypothetically require a 100 hitrate per stage, the detector would tend to train up so as to perfectly detect its training set assuming it was able to, which seems to imply overtraining. p

Negative 1972 pUpon further testing the provided solution to my problem which was to wordwrap text inside of the html tags and keep the original enclosing tags such as a codeltpgtcode or a codeltbgtcode or even an codeltigtcode tag around the words cut at a set position. This is useful for certain application that require a specific formatting to function for the front end. I have modified the code provided to try to achieve this however I have been unsuccessful with the challenging content used in this php example.p  pI could really use some assistance and Im sure others could use this information to build dynamic html based books like I am trying to do. it isnt restricted to books there are also possibilities of sliders and other implementations. by not keeping the end tags around each split you are limited to splitting codes that dont break the surrounding code such as codeltbrgtcode tags.

Negative 1972 pWhat exactly is the difference between growing a NN and using a cascade NN, or is this the same thingp  pWhat I get from various sources, is that growing simply adds additional neurons and initializes its weights randomly.

Negative 1972 pIn order to better understand how debug loggers work, I tried to implement my own logger in java. Shown in the code below. As far as I understand loggers are usually singletons. I want to use the same instance in different classes of my application. Each class where I use this logger will log to a different file. But that would mean that the singleton is being mutated by different objects. Wouldnt this cause inaccurately logging one classes debug output into a file that should be logged into by the other class. Since the same logger instance is shared across the entire app, how do different files get generated Its the SAME instance being mutated in the application. So I decided to make the logFile location a final but then all classes would log to the same file. Could you shed some light on these curiositiesp  pThank you in advance.p  precodepublic class Logger       private final String logFile     private static Logger instance      private LoggerString logFile         this.logFile  logFile           public Logger getInstanceString logFile         synchronizedLogger.class             ifinstancenull                 instance  new LoggerlogFile                               return instance           public void writeString data throws IOException         PrintWriter out  new PrintWriter new BufferedWriternew FileWriterlogFile         out.writedata        codepre

Negative 1972 pI want to make this general question.

Negative 1972 pSo right now Im trying to draw relations between 3 different tables using a hrefhttpsgithub.combrodysoftCordovaSQLitePlugin relnofollowsqlitea Im relatively new to sqlite but saw that you can draw relations by using foreign keys thus optimizing performance. So right now here is my sql statements creating my tablesp  precodeCREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS shifts   shiftsid primary integer,  shiftbaseid integer,  shiftsiteid integer  CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS sites   siteid primary integer,   siteinfo text,  FOREIGN KEYsiteid REFERENCES shiftsshiftsiteid   CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS bases   baseid primary integer,   baseinfo text,  FOREIGN KEYbaseid REFERENCES shiftsshiftbaseid codepre  pSo what Im trying to do is draw relations between the child tables sites and bases with the parent table shifts by the id. The problem Im running into is Im getting a foreign key mismatch error. I read somewhere that in sqlite you can only REFERENCE a primary or unique key within the parent table. The problem with this is that multiple shifts can share the same sites and bases. For instance baseid could equal 1234 and multiple shifts would have shiftsbaseid  1234. p  pAlso there will be times where a baseid in the bases table wont have a matching shiftbaseid in the shifts table.p  pSo my question is how to reference this one to many relation between multiple tables And how to make that relation optional.p

Negative 1972 pI have a fairly simple array of objects that can be edited in KOp  pstronga hrefhttpjsfiddle.netrwalter2g4a0mob2 relnofollowHeres a test case.astrong Try clicking on the items and editing them down below. It works.p  pHowever...p  pThe data loaded into the array comes from a JSON stringp  precode self.text  ko.observable[ value 1, text Low , ..... ] codepre  pThis must be parsed and converted into a JS object. This is done in the computed function like thisp  precode self.ssArray  ko.computed     read function            Convert text into JS object          Not using ko.utils because I want to use trycatch to detect bad JS later          var arrayJS  JSON.parseko.utils.unwrapObservableself.text           Make an array of observables          Not using ko.mapping in order to get back to basics          Also mapping function throws an error re iterations or something          var obsArrayJS  ko.utils.arrayMaparrayJS, functioni              return                  value ko.observablei.value,                 text ko.observablei.text                                 return array of objects with observable properties.         return obsArrayJS           Tried this but made no difference         return ko.observableArrayobsArrayJS     , codepre  pNow what I want is for the original text string to be updated whenever the model is updated. It should be a simple case of ko.toJSON on the modelp  precode write functionvalue          self.textko.toJSONthis.ssArray     , codepre  pAs you can see from the fiddle, self.text is not updated.p  pWhy is thisp  pI have tried the followingp  ul lireturning an observableArray from the read function  makes no differenceli lireturn an observableArray of observable objects each with observable propertiesli liusing the mapping plugin to make everything possible observable li ul  pI guess it boils down to how KO knows to fire the write function. Surely if the contents of ssArray change then codewritecode is fired But not in my case...p  pPossible further complication is that this will be a KO component. The text input will actually come from a parameter passed from the widget. So I guess it will already be an observable So it will need to update the parent viewmodel too. p  pIn addition to this Im trying to use the sortable plugin to allow reordering of these items  but Ive removed that from my test case.p
Negative 1972 h1Preludeh1  pI have one my own .so library lets name it lib.so, and two applications, that use the library lets name it a.out amp b.out. In the library I use the next shown the idea, not the exact codep  precodeint a[N]  for i  0 i lt N i a[i]  i codepre  pAs I understand, since for every connected application there will be another set of variables, so at the moment when both application are running, there will be two copies of the codeacode variable. There are some math formulas I use for codeacode filling, they remain unchanged. So, since the codeNcode is quite big, I want to reduce the memory consumption and leave only one copy of the codeacode in memory. So, I want to use shared memory mechanism. Since I write it under and for Linux, I want to use Unix System V.p  h1The problemh1  pThe first loaded application must initialise the array, all another connected applications will only read from that array, so I want to give them 0444 rights to that blockp  precodeid  shmget..., ..., 0444  IPCCREATE  IPCEXCL codepre  pBut the very first one must receive 0666 rights to fill the arrayp  precodeid  shmget..., ..., 0666  IPCCREATE  IPCEXCL codepre  pSo I came up with the next codep  precodeif id  shmget..., ..., 0444  IPCCREATE  IPCEXCL  1     id  shmget..., ..., 0666  PCCREATE    initdataid  shmat inside   char  data  char shmatid, 0, 0 codepre  pNow I have the problem. If I want to be ideologically right, I need to remove 0666 rights from the first copy I give it 0444 instead.

Negative 1972 pI have a create method in my RegistrationsController, which inherits from DeviseRegistrations controller. It is supposed to call Stripe and if the creation of a customer is successful, it saves the user and sends a confirmation email, which is handled by create in Devise. If the call to Stripe fails, it is supposed to set a flash and not save the user or send an email, i.e. suppress the Devise create method. The method works fine if the call to Stripe is successful, but if it is not successful, the user is still saved and the confirmation email is still sent.p  precodeclass RegistrationsController lt DeviseRegistrationsController    def create     super      user  resource     result  UserSignup.newuser.signupparams[stripeToken], params[plan]      if result.successful       return     else       flash[error]  result.errormessage        TODO OVERIDE SUPER METHOD SO THE CONFIRM EMAIL IS         NOT SENT AND USER IS NOT SAVED  EXIT THE METHOD     end   end codepre  pI have tried skipconfirmation, this just bypasses the need for confirmation. resource.skipconfirmationnotification also does not work. I have also tried redefining resource.sendconfirmationinstructions nil end My thought was to exit the create method altogether in the else block. How can I exit the create method or suppress super in the else block, or would another approach be better Thanks.p

Negative 1972 pIm delving into Entity Framework for the first time  using Visual Studio 2010, as Im not currently in a position to upgrade, which I think makes it V4.p  pOne concept Im having trouble working out is how to handle complex calculated values that need to be worked out from the database.p  pAs a very simple example, if I have two entities one being the parent and one being the child  is it possible to get an instance of the parent and then get a value calculated from the number of child entities without having to load the child entitiesp  pNormally I would create getupdatedelete store procedures in the database, and in the get I would have a codeSelect Count From Child Where ChildId  ParentId As NumChildrencode and store that value against the parent.p  pThis is a very simple example, and what I want to do is massively more complex, involving multiple tiers and specific properties.  Therefore I dont want to have to load every single entity just to get the countsp  pBut how do you do that in Entity Frameworkp

Negative 1972 pI usedp  precoderails new app skiptestunit codepre  pbecause initially, I thought I could add testing later.p  pI developed a significant portion of my app.p  pNow, I would like to add TestUnit but I couldnt find any documentation on how to do it. Googling only lead me to the Rails Guides and tutorials that assume you didnt ask rails to skip the testing framework when you first created the app.p  pI know I might be able to figure out what test.rb files to add manually and how to modify the Rakefile by looking at an app that was created without skipping tests but I prefer to find an easier approach if it exists.p  pI think the skiptestunit writes something somewhere to tell the Rails generators not to generate tests, and as well, it removes the rake tasks related to tests.p  pIt would be good to find out if there is a command or a config file modification to restore TestUnit to my Rails app.p  pI dont necessarily mind if the existing controllersmodels do not have tests and I dont necessarily want to add tests to them, but going forward, I would like tests to be generated by the generators, and I would like to be able to runp  precoderake test codepre

Negative 1972 pI am making a simple system in Shiny that consist in a textBox and a number of checkboxes below it.

Negative 1972 pI am facing a problem with codeJTablecode when inserting codeJTablecode values into the database. For example I have three columns, and user enters the corresponding data into three columns, codeJTablecode has several rows and I have one submit button at bottom of the table. After filling the data into all the rows, when the user press the submit button, the data is inserted into the database. This works fine without any problems.p  pNow consider user enters only 10 rows and he didnt click the submit button, because of some power failure the system shutdown suddenly. Now I want to store these 10 rows in a collection and when the application is started again I want to insert these 10 rows values automatically into the database. Please consider that user information is very critical information. I dont know how to do this.p

For example, lower layers tend to produce strokes or simple ornamentlike patterns, because those layers are sensitive to basic features such as edges and their orientations. p blockquote  pThe post is a hrefhttpgoogleresearch.blogspot.co.uk201506inceptionismgoingdeeperintoneural.htmlm1 relnofollowhttpgoogleresearch.blogspot.co.uk201506inceptionismgoingdeeperintoneural.htmlm1a. p  pstrongMy questionstrong the post describes this as a simple caseis there an opensource implementation of a nn that could be used for this purpose in a relatively plugandplay process  For just the technique described, does the network need to be trained p  pNo doubt for other techniques mentioned in the paper one needs a network already trained on a large number of images, but for the one Ive described is there already some kind of opensource network layer visualization packagep

I could use code.toscode in the spec itself but I want to keep my specs clean as possible and thought factories would be a great place to keep this configuration...p  pstrongIs there a fabrication library that would let me do thisstrongp  pJust some more experimentationp  precodegt WHY ARE YOU NOT A STRING.tof gt 0.0 codepre  pOkay, so somewhere, in rails or in factorygirl, codetofcode is being called on my beloved string.

Is there a way how I can do thisp  pIs there maybe a way to check which fields are filled in, and that the query is automatically changed with the filled in fieldsp  precodeltDOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC W3CDTD HTML 4.01EN     httpwww.w3.orgTRhtml4strict.dtdgt lthtmlgt ltheadgt lttitlegtZoekenlttitlegt  ltheadgt ltbodygt ltpgtlta hrefnew.phpgtltimg srcadd.png width20px height20pxgtltagt    lta hrefsearch.phpgtltimg srcsearch.png width20px height20pxgtltagt  lta  hrefsearchlijnen.phpgtltimg srcnumber.png width20px height20pxgtltagt  ltpgt ltform action methodpostgt ltdivgt lttablegt lttrgtlttdgtltstronggtLocatie ltstronggtlttdgtlttdgtltinput typetext nameLocatie value gtlttdgt lttrgt lttrgtlttdgtltstronggtPeriode ltstronggtlttdgtlttdgtltinput typetext namePeriode value gtlttdgt lttrgt lttrgtlttdgtltstronggtDag ltstronggtlttdgtlttdgtltinput typetext nameDag value gtlttdgt lttrgt lttrgtlttdgtltstronggtDienst ltstronggtlttdgt lttdgtltinput typetext nameDienst value gtlttdgtlttrgt lttrgtlttdgtlttdgtlttdgtltinput typesubmit namezoeken valueZoekengtlttdgtlttrgt lttablegt  ltdivgt   ltformgt   ltpgtlta hrefnew.phpgtltimg srcadd.png width20px height20pxgtltagt  lta hrefsearch.phpgtltimg srcsearch.png width20px height20pxgtltagt  lta hrefsearchlijnen.phpgtltimg srcnumber.png width20px height20pxgtltagt ltpgt ltbodygt lthtmlgt  ltphp   if issetPOST[zoeken]    includeconnectdb.php Locatie   POST[Locatie] Periode   POST[Periode] Dag   POST[Dag] Dienst   POST[Dienst]   get results from database result  mysqlquerySELECT  FROM WMCDeLijn WHERE LocatieLocatie ANY PeriodePeriode ANY DagDagANY DienstDienst       or diemysqlerror   display data in table echo lth2gtResultatenlth2gtltpgt echo lttable border1 cellpadding10gt echo lttablegtlttrgtltthgtIDltthgtltthgtLocatieltthgtltthgtPeriodeltthgtltthgtDagltthgtltthgtDienstltthgtltthgtDelenltthgtltthgtGeleedltthgtltthgtStart 1ltthgtltthgtEind 1ltthgtltthgtStart 2ltthgtltthgtEind 2ltthgtltthgtLijnenltthgtlttrgt    loop through results of database query, displaying them in the table whilerow  mysqlfetcharray result         echo out the contents of each row into a table     echo lttrgt     echo lttd aligncentergt . row[id] . lttdgt     echo lttd aligncentergt . row[Locatie] . lttdgt     echo lttd aligncentergt . row[Periode] . lttdgt     echo lttd aligncentergt . row[Dag] . lttdgt     echo lttd aligncentergt . row[Dienst] . lttdgt     echo lttd aligncentergt . row[Delen] . lttdgt     echo lttd aligncentergt . row[Geleed] . lttdgt     echo lttd aligncentergt . row[Start1] . lttdgt     echo lttd aligncentergt . row[Eind1] . lttdgt     echo lttd aligncentergt . row[Start2] . lttdgt     echo lttd aligncentergt . row[Eind2] . lttdgt     echo lttd aligncentergt . row[Lijnen] . lttdgt     Link to edit record     echo lttd aligncentergtlta hrefedit.phpid . row[id] . gtltimg srcedit.png width20px height20pxgtltagtlttdgt      Link to delete record     echo lttd aligncentergtlta hrefdelete.phpid . row[id] . gtltimg srcdelete.png width20px height20pxgtltagtlttdgt      Link to Add Event to Google Calendar     echo lttd aligncentergtlta hrefAddEvent.phpid . row[id] . gtltimg srcproceed.png width20px height20pxgtltagtlttdgt     echo lttrgt    close tablegt echo lttablegt   gt codepre
Negative 1972 pSo I know that my code below works.

Negative 1972 pIn my MVC application, a superadministrator can set a queue of tasks such as updating database. So, when an admin adds an update to the queue, the controller starts a new tasks that works in a background. However, when you add a few tasks, the application throws  codeSystem.Threading.ThreadAbortException Thread was being abortedcode. Moreover, the stacktrace suggests that it happens on different lines in code.    p  pI should also add that the tasks use EF6 entities to work with sqlserver, and according to the stack trace, it happens after or while performing operations on the database.

Negative 1972 pI would like to know how to model an app with Navigator component of reactnative for large app. I have two ways in mindp  ul liFirstly, We can use Navigator component as a top level component and pass down the props to each child components which required navigator object or use passProps to transfer them to next view and use props again to make them available to child components.li liSecondly, People are talking about the flux architecture and they say trigger some action and use that action to trigger the navigation for next view. This is good because we can check for various states and redirect or restrict user to different view e.g. loggedIn, loggedOut, Owner etc.li ul  pI tried to model navigation using second strategy with triggering some action and stores listening to it and emitting the change with state as the payload. Then, I check the Navigation Top View component to check for key and use if statement to trigger the navigation using codethis.prop.navigator.pushcode. The problem, I encountered with this is navigator doesnt change for else if statements. Theoretically, it should work but its not working and I have no clue.p  pFor model one, Im having problems with passing props down.

cancel button which will update that status property to cancelling then set a field in the worker class to indicate the action is cancelling, the UI takes about 2 seconds to respond to the button click. Ive tried Task.Run and Task.Factory.StartNew with a variety of overloads and creating my own worker thread seems to work the best but still not how I want.p  pWhat Im looking for is you click on execute button, status is updated to activeupdating the ui bound to that property then when the cancel button is clicked the status is changed to cancelling and the task to notify the worker sets the appropriate fieldthe worker thread checks this field often and exits when needed.p  pWhats not working is the worker thread blocks the ui thread from updating to show the user the action is cancelling.The cancel button is temporarily unable to be clicked after status is set to activep  pAlso noteworthy is this solution is using mvvm where the status is an enum value the ui binds to with a converter.p  pAny question just let me know.p

Negative 1972 pTo demonstrate the problem I created a simple application that consists of 4 blank forms. One of them Form1 is the main and shows automatically. Showing other forms I put in the code projectp  precode begin   Application.Initialize   Application.CreateFormTForm1, Form1   Application.CreateFormTForm2, Form2   Application.CreateFormTForm3, Form3   Application.CreateFormTForm4, Form4   Form2.Show   Form3.Show   Form4.Show   Application.Run end. codepre  pOn the second form or any other Form2 I put a button that, when clicked, synchronously executes long 5 seconds SQL query any, I open the stored procedure. Is it synchronous, that is, the app hangs for at least 10 seconds. At this time triggers the windows ghosting. Windows creates Windows Ghost for all Windows stale apps that you can minimize, move and close. After executing a query, the application resumes processing messages and everything returns to its original state.p  pIt must be so, but for me it is not. In fact, after defrosting program Zorder of the Windows is changed, the order of the Windows mixed. Moreover, the top or bottom can get out of any window, I have not noticed any pattern. It seems that Windows does not correctly restore the Zorder when cancelling the ghosting.p  pThis behavior is also found in Delphi 2007. Note that under the Delphi debugger mode ghosting is disabled and you will not see this behavior. Run the application without debugger to see this behaviour. After disabling mode ghosting with DisableProcessWindowsGhosting  everything works correctly. p  pBut I dont want to completely disable this mode, the program often hangs for more than 5 seconds, and this mode is useful the user is still nicer to look at Windows that somehow redrawn than not redrawn at all. To rewrite half the program code for asynchronous execution of queries is very long and timeconsuming task, Im afraid we dont have enough resources, although it is undoubtedly the right approach.p  pMainFormOnTaskBar property has nothing to do with my question, there is no such property in delphi 7.p  pDoes this effect anyone else besides me If not  where did I go wrong How to force Windows to properly reconstruct the sequence of Windows p

Negative 1972 pI have an application that uses EntityFramework with a DbContext, using Sql Server.  If I hook up SQL Profiler to my database, I can see all of the commands that EF executes, as well as the database readwrites for each command.p  pI often use the readswrites values to measure the cost of a command and seek out specific problem queries.  However, SQL Profiler is not an ideal tool for my teams needs, as it requires that all of our developers and QA have direct database access, which many do not.  This keeps other members of the team back from effectively profiling their code or evaluating how efficient their queries are.  SQL Profilers interface can also be cumbersome and setting it up can take a fair amount of time.  Id like to develop better ways for our team to view profiling information from within the application itself, or at least keep logs of it.p  pa hrefhttpwww.codeproject.comArticles499902ProfilingEntityFramework5incode relnofollowThis guidea gives a good approach for logging the SQL commands EF generates at least when SaveChanges is called.  However, Id also like to be able to display the database readswrites caused by these commands, just as SQL profiler does.  Is there a way to get this information from within the CEF model  If not, how might one go about profiling the execution cost of specific SQL commands that come out of EF  One could log the time that a particular transaction takes, but we often batch large numbers of commands into transactions, and the time is going to be highly variable based on what other users or jobs are running on the system. Are there other reliable approaches to measuring the impact of command execution in EF without using SQL Profilerp

Negative 1972 pi have a weird Problem with the Java serializationdeserialization.p  pBesides all other problems with serialization and the proper usage of serialVersionUIDs such a behaviour is completely new to mep  pOn one machine my software is running on openSuse 13.1 a update switched the Java version to Java 8. Now, i get a java.io.InvalidClassException if i try to reopen a project file of the software which is a serialized Java Object because one of the included classes has the wrong serialVersionUID. The weird thing is, that these class is a class from an external library and has not changed several month but has no hard coded serialVersionUID field. p  pIf i switch back to Java 7 on that machine, the error do not occur. I can reproduce that error on other machines with openSuse 13.1  Java 8 but not with machines with Windows or other Linux distributions like Ubuntu with Java 8 or Java 7.p  pOn all machines the official sunoracle JRE package is installed.p  pSo, has anybody faced that problem at any time I do not think that it is a bug in Java 8, because it only occurs on an openSuse 13.1 machine. But how could the guys from openSuse mess up their system such, that java would hash the class in a different way as before as Java has not changed that process in a new version p  pEDIT To be clear, the class who causes the problem is from an external library. It has not changed in month. And the solution can not be to define a serialVersionUID, because that error has some other sources and would still be there. And i think, it would not stop with this class, it would affect all classes from my used libraries with no defined serialVersionUIDp  pEDIT2 Here is the exact errorp  precodejava.io.InvalidClassException edu.uci.ics.jung.graph.util.Pair local class incompatible stream classdesc serialVersionUID  7664847375082415686, local class serialVersionUID  638192081897624765  codepre  pOn all other machines i can test it, the class has the hashed serialVersionUID 7664847375082415686, only openSuse 13.1  Java 8 get a result of 638192081897624765p

Negative 1972 pWhat would be the best way to include a lot of images in the bundle I have an index of game items thus about 40005000 image files total 27mb so not that big.

Negative 1972 pI have a strongNode.js  wsstrong server and a strongQt clientstrong.  Im having an issue with the websocket connection closing unexpectedly in certain conditions.  In my client, I iterate through a list of objects and send a series of requests to the server.  The server then accesses a database and then writes the response back to the client.  Here is the simplified basic server loopp  precode ...  var httpServer  http.createServerparams var WebSocketServer  requirews.Server var wss  new WebSocketServer server httpServer    ...  wss.onconnection, function connectionws     ws.onmessage, function incomingmsg      handleRequestJSON.parsemsg, function err, result        if err throw err       ws.sendJSON.stringifyresult, function ackerror          if error throw error                  codepre  pIf I limit the number of request from the client, everything works fine.  But if I reach a critical number of requests, data stops coming back from the server and the websocket connection times out.p  pIm wondering if I need to flush the websocket on the server before or after each write  strongQtWebSocketstrong has a strongflushstrong method, but I dont see this capability in the strongwsstrong docs.  Any ideas would be appreciated.p  pUPDATE I should also note that no errors are sent to either strongwsstrong or strongwssstrong.  Data just stops flowing.p

Negative 1972 pSo I have multiple intranet website projects in one solution. All .net 4.6 MVC 5. One of those projects is a Global project housing all stylesheets and css files that apply across the Intranet. Bootstrap, jQuery, etc As well as several universal apps that deal with the other stuff Email queueing, Security, etc p  pI have been investigating the bundling feature again. I ditched it originally because it was across projects and it didnt like it. However Ive started looking again, and I love the minification only on release mode and separate files in debug mode  great. However across project I have to reference the bundles with a url which always minify and are cached to the point where the project needs rebuilding to update the css. This is playing havoc with my attempts to update styles and expect it to work with BrowserLink.p  pId rather not go back to an ugly list of links that change with debug mode or not, is there a way of bundling files from another project in the same solution, or from another URL in release modep

My problem is, this is an animation which I need to display when a button is clicked.
