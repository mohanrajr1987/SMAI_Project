Positive 1874 pI am developing a chat application on JavaFX and I stuck with a little problem. In short, I want to have a possibility to insert an imagefor example smiles inside TextField which is intended for text input.But as I know, there is no possibility to insert images inside this element. Does JavaFX have some alternatives for that or maybe you know something else, what I can use for thisp  pThank you, in advance.p
Positive 1874 pI want to create a multiline textbox control that will be used for an application as Snap to grid when all of the characters are Monospaced, and the fitting font size was found for example  for a textbox with 6 columns, exactly 6 characters should be entered.  Of course with Word Wrapp  pAs for the above  its OK. The correct way to calculate the font size was found.p  pThe only issue is that I need to create an AltEnter option to represent Enter. p  pFor some reasons, I cant use rn and need that all of the remaining line space will be full of whitespaces. The thing is that wrap doesnt accept spaces in an amount which is larger than the textboxs width. For examplep  pIf I write in a textbox with width8cells, the following or paste that string etc..p  pHello      World Hello6WhitespacesWorld p  pI would like to recieve whitespacep  pFirst Line Hello p  pSecond Line Worldp  pThird Line p  pWhat really happens isp  pFirst Line Hellop  pSecond Line Worldp  pNo spaces at all in the beginning of the second linep  pPS  On debug I can see that the spaces all of them are considered as a part of the string.p

Positive 1874 pI have a WPF application, that has a number TextBox elements.  The user fills those out, and the application then prints them.  The problem with TextBoxes is that if you keep typing in one, once you fill it out to the end, the text starts scrolling horizontally to make room for more letters, and you no longer see the first couple letters that were typed in.p  pIt was decided that the solution is to prevent the user from entering more text that will fit inside the TextBox.  Whats the best way of going about itp  pI looked at TextBox properties, and didnt see anything that would do what I want directly.  The first idea, is to set wrapping to Wrap.  Then subscribe to PreviewTextInput event, and if the number of lines is going to exceed 1, handle the event without adding newly typed in text.  Obviously youll still be able to get around it by pasting text, but the bigger issue is that it will only work for single line TextBoxes, and I need it to work with multiline TextBoxes as well.p  pIs there a better approach that Im missing  Would calculating text width, and then making sure its less than TextBox widthheight how be a better option  Or perhaps another solutionp

Negative 1874 pI have a port scanning application that uses work queues and threads.p  pIt uses simple TCP connections and spends a lot of time waiting for packets to come back up to half a second. Thus the threads dont need to fully execute i.e. first half sends a packet, context switch, does stuff, comes back to thread which has network data waiting for it.p  pI suspect I can improve performance by modifying the codesys.setcheckintervalcode from the default of 100 which lets up to 100 bytecodes execute before switching to another thread.p  pBut without knowing how many bytecodes are actually executing in a thread or function Im flying blind and simply guessing values, testing and relying on the testing shows a measurable difference which is difficult since the amount of code being executed is minimal a simple socket connection, thus network jitter will likely affect any measurements more than changing sys.setcheckinterval.p  pThus I would like to find out how many bytecodes are in certain code executions i.e. total for a function or in execution of a thread so I can  make more intelligent guesses at what to set sys.setcheckinterval to.p
Negative 1874 pIve been wondering if its possible to have FluentNHibernate communicate with stored procedures that already exist and assign mapping from the result set to my own domain objects.p  pAlso is FluentNHibernate able to directly execute procedures with no result set returnedp  pBasically Ive been considering the implications of using FluentNHibernate to replace a dated TypedDataSet model with a domain driven design that can return simple objects from the DAL. If FluentNHibernate cannot work with SPs easily, I think I would most likley have a combinational DAL that will take advantage of FNH for simple CRUD operations while leaving complex procedures to be managed by Enterprise Library. While I dont think it would be optimal to have 2 competing DALs if FNH cannot play well with SPs Id love to hear any other ideas than using both EntLib and FNH together.p

Negative 1874 pIm looking for a way to dump export the contents of an OS X keychain into a file that I can easily process elsewhere, such as tabdelimited plaintext or something of the sort.p  pThe Keychain Access app does not offer any such functionality, and getting a keys data involves opening each in turn, and having to type in the keychains password to see the password stored with the key, every time.p  pAfter a bit of digging, I found somebodys solution by using AppleScript and the Keychain Scripting app to access keychains cant link to individual post scroll down about two thirds to the end of the pagep  pa hrefhttpdiscussions.apple.comthread.jspathreadID1398759httpdiscussions.apple.comthread.jspathreadID1398759ap  pUsing Keychain scripting, you can access all data fields of all the keys including the plaintext password  and its fairly easy to dump this data into a text file etc. Ive tested it and it works well.p  pHowever, this solution still involves having to confirm access to each key by clicking OK on a dialog. This is much better than having to type in the keychains password every time, but its still irritating. Furthermore, you have to confirm access twice for each key once for Script Editor or the script itself if its running as an app and once for Keychain Scripting. So, if youre processing a keychain with 100 keys, you have to manually click OK on 200 dialogs.p  pIm now looking for a solution to get around this. I realize that as its the purpose of keychains to safeguard the sensitive data and prevent precisely the kind of thing Im trying to do, any such solution would probably involve some kind of hack.p  pId be very interested in your ideasp

Negative 1874 pWe use grep, cut, sort, uniq, and join at the command line all the time to do data analysis.  They work great, although there are shortcomings.  For example, you have to give column numbers to each tool.  We often have wide files many columns and a column header that gives column names.  In fact, our files look a lot like SQL tables.  Im sure there is a driver ODBC that will operate on delimited text files, and some query engine that will use that driver, so we could just use SQL queries on our text files.  Since doing analysis is usually ad hoc, it would have to be minimal setup to query new files just use the files I specify in this directory rather than declaring particular tables in some config.p  pPractically speaking, whats the easiest  That is, the SQL engine and driver that is easiest to set up and use to apply against text filesp

When he comes to the end of the recordrow, he tabs again, and the form automatically creates a new blank row for him to start entering data in again. In actuality, it displays a blank row below the current new record, which the user can actually click in to to start a new records as well. It also allows the user to scroll up and down to see all the current subset of records hes working on.p  pIs there a way to replicate this functionality in PyQt I havent managed to find a way to get Qt to do this easily. Access takes care of it automatically no code outside the form is required. Is it that easy in PyQt or even close, or is this something thats going to need to be programmed from scratchp

Negative 1874 pIm really confused, and not even sure what to search for to find answers.  Im getting multiple calls to a javascript function.  Its not making sense to me.p  pHeres what the code does. p  precodeexpensestxt.livekeyup, function      this.typeWatch highlight true, wait 500, captureLength 0, callback calculateexpenses   codepre  pThe Calculateexpenses is a javascript function that uses jquery ajax to call a php page that returns data that gets displayed in a span.p  pIm using firebug to help me debug and in the Calculateexpenses function I put a console.log to debug when this function is being called. p  pHeres whats going on.  I only have 1 input box in the DOM at the time this happens, when I press only one key, the output in the console puts out one debug msg like it should, when I press a key again in the same input box the output in the console is doubled ie, the Calculateexpenses function got called twice but should have only been called once, when I press a key again for a total of 3 key presses the output in the console puts out 3 calls to the Calculateexpenses function now.....and so forth.  I dont really know whats going on here.  The code appears to me that it would only call the Calculateexpenses function 1 time, but when using firebug it actually is being called over and over when I dont want it to be.p  pAny ideas  Is it the way Im using .live  If I just use the keyup event it works fine, problem is I need to use typeWatch plugin to delay the ajax call until after the typing is finished and the keyup event triggers too soon.  The reason Im using live is because I dynamically add elements to the dom and this is the only way I could figure out how to use both typeWatch and dynamically add elements to the dom that needed to be summed up...p  pyour thoughts are appreciated.  thanks.p

Please do not discuss subject like TSQL is for sets, you should do it in a batch all records in once, you should make TSQL faster.

Counters which go up and down are from real data, I had to make sure with each select I get one record. And the last one  with LINQ the only difference is SELECT, I fetch all fields UPDATE is copiedamppasted. However I can take time of LINQ SELECT and add it to this time of TSQL and I should get LINQ SELECTUPDATE.

Negative 1874 pThis may be a fairly subjective question, but maybe not. My application contains a bunch of forms that are displayed to the user at different times.  Each form is a class of its own.

Most of the time I dont have to pass any arguments to the constructor at all.  The downside is obviously that if Im passing a bad set of arguments, it cant detect that at compilation time, so if it fails, a dialog is displayed at runtime.  But it wont normally fail, and itll be easy to debug if it does.p  pI think this is much cleaner because I come from languages where the use of function and class literals is pretty common.

This allows for method specific behavior including default values, ability to provide javadoc, and ability to put all these methods in the same class.  Also it works well with Weld out of the box.

Negative 1874 h1A Hackers Taleh1  pThe date is 120210.  The days before Christmas are dripping away and Ive pretty much hit a major road block as a windows programmer.  Ive been using AQTime, Ive tried sleepy, shiny, and very sleepy, and as we speak, VTune is installing.  Ive tried to use the VS2008 profiler, and its been positively punishing as well as often insensible.  Ive used the random pause technique.  Ive examined calltrees.  Ive fired off function traces.  But the sad painful fact of the matter is that the app Im working with is over a million lines of code, with probably another million lines worth of thirdparty apps.p  pI need better tools.  emIve read the other topics.em  Ive tried out each profiler listed in each topic.  There simply has to be something better than these junky and expensive options, or ludicrous amounts of work for almost no gain.  To further complicate matters, our code is heavily threaded, and runs a number of Qt Event loops, some of which are so fragile that they crash under heavy instrumentation due to timing delays.  Dont ask me why were running multiple event loops.  No one can tell me.p  pAre there any options more along the lines of Valgrind in a windows environmentbr Is there anything better than the long swath of broken tools Ive already triedbr Is there anything designed to integrate with Qt, perhaps with a useful display of events in queue   p  pA full list of the tools I tried, with the ones that were really useful in italicsp  ul liemAQTimeem Rather good  Has some trouble with deep recursion, but the call graph is correct in these cases, and can be used to clear up any confusion you might have.  Not a perfect tool, but worth trying out.  It might suit your needs, and it certainly was good enough for me most of the time.li liemRandom Pause attack in debug modeem Not enough information enough of the time.br A good tool but not a complete solution.li liemParallel Studiosem  The nuclear option.  Obtrusive, weird, and crazily powerful.  I think you should hit up the 30 day evaluation, and figure out if its a good fit.

VS2008, boost libraries.  Qt 4.  And the wretched humdinger of them all QtMFC integration via trolltech. hr strongNowstrong Almost two weeks later, it looks like my issue is resolved.  Thanks to a variety of tools, including almost everything on the list and a couple of my personal tricks, we found the primary bottlenecks.  However, Im going to keep testing, exploring, and trying out new profilers as well as new tech.  Why  Because I owe it to you guys, because you guys rock.  It does slow the timeline down a little, but Im still very excited to keep trying out new tools.p  pstrongSynopsisstrongbr Among many other problems, a number of components had recently been switched to the incorrect threading model, causing serious hangups due to the fact that the code underneath us was suddenly no longer multithreaded.  I cant say more because it violates my NDA, but I can tell you that this would never have been found by casual inspection or even by normal code review.  Without profilers, callgraphs, and random pausing in conjunction, wed still be screaming our fury at the beautiful blue arc of the sky.  Thankfully, I work with some of the best hackers Ive ever met, and I have access to an amazing verse full of great tools and great people.p  pGentlefolk, I appreciate this tremendously, and only regret that I dont have enough rep to reward each of you with a bounty.  I still think this is an important question to get a better answer to than the ones weve got so far on SO.  p  pAs a result, each week for the next three weeks, Ill be putting up the biggest bounty I can afford, and awarding it to the answer with the nicest tool that I think isnt common knowledge.  After three weeks, well hopefully have accumulated a definitive profile of the profilers, if youll pardon my punning.p  pstrongTakeawaystrongbr Use a profiler.  Theyre good enough for Ritchie, Kernighan, Bentley, and Knuth. I dont care who you think you are.  Use a profiler.  If the one youve got doesnt work, find another.  If you cant find one, code one.  If you cant code one, or its a small hang up, or youre just stuck, use random pausing.  If all else fails, hire some grad students to bang out a profiler.p  phr strongA Longer Viewstrongbr So, I thought it might be nice to write up a bit of a retrospective.  I opted to work extensively with Parallel Studios, in part because it is actually built on top of the PIN Tool.  Having had academic dealings with some of the researchers involved, I felt that this was probably a mark of some quality.  Thankfully, I was right.  While the GUI is a bit dreadful, I found IPS to be incredibly useful, though I cant comfortably recommend it for everyone.  Critically, theres no obvious way to get linelevel hit counts, something that AQT and a number of other profilers provide, and Ive found very useful for examining rate of branchselection among other things.  In net, Ive enjoyed using AQTime as well, and Ive found their support to be really responsive.  Again, I have to qualify my recommendation  A lot of their features dont work that well, and some of them are downright crashprone on Win7x64.  XPerf also performed admirably, but is agonizingly slow for the sampling detail required to get good reads on certain kinds of applications.  p  pRight now, Id have to say that I dont think theres a definitive option for profiling C code in a W7x64 environment, but there are certainly options that simply fail to perform any useful service.p

Negative 1874 pIm planning on saving my users often used parameters, i.e. name, picture, etc, in session variables as opposed to pulling then from the MySQL table each time they are needed.  Saving often used parameters in variables as opposed to a database in theory should be more efficient, but because Im not sure how SESSION variables are saved Im not too sure if this is true.  Does anyone know if pulling info. from a SESSION variable is more efficient than querying the MySQL table p  pThe term variable is used loosely as SESSION variables are stored in files in the servers temporary directory.p  pYou would think reading files is more costly than reading a database, I mean that is what a database is essentially, a file, but it is optimized for this purpose as opposed to temporary session filesp

Id really like something that lets your run the PHP script on your page AND execute the MySQL queries.

Negative 1874 pWhen I saw that you could do simple data binding with Jackson, I instinctively felt like this would be very useful. The prospect of not having to designcreate specific Java classes is very appealing. But I dont understand how simple data binding really speeds things up. If you end with a codeMapltString, Objectgtcode then theres a fair amount of hoops to jump through to get that data out of the map, nop  pI must be missing something here because it seems to me that you end up with a different kind of parsing headache. Instead of manually parsing the JSON yourself or writing a class for full binding, youre pulling teeth with all sorts of casting, etc to get the correct data from the codeMapcode. p  pWhat am I missing Can someone show me where simple data binding shinesp

Building the iOS app and an OS X application to query MySQL is not an issue, but I have no idea how to build the Web Server part i.e. having a Cocoa application listening for incoming requests etc. Is it a good idea to somehow use Apache as the Web Server If so how do I do this i.e. Apache modules, PERL bridging to Cocoa If not, what are the alternatives This application if successfully will potentially have many users so the Web Server must be secure hence the reason of looking into Apache. p

Negative 1874 pIm working with c.NET MVC2 and Im trying to create an ajax form that calls a method that deletes a database record RemoveRelation. The process of deleting the record is working as intended. After the record is deleted the form should call a javascript function that removes the record from the visuals RemoveRelation10. This is done through an AJAX call that on Internet Explorer 9 and Firefox 4 are all working as intended however on Chrome for some reason the update is not happening throuhg an AJAX call and the whole page is refreshing when the form to delete the record is being submitted this is incorrect as the form is supposedly being generated with AJAX functionality. This is the code with which I am generating the formp  precode lt using Ajax.BeginFormRemoveRelation, Relations,        new AjaxOptions  OnSuccess  function  RemoveRelation10  , InsertionMode  InsertionMode.Replace, UpdateTargetId  Relation10 ,        new  id  DeleteForm10      gt codepre  pAdditionally on Chrome I have another issue with a separate Ajax.BeginForm.p  precodelt using Ajax.BeginFormAddRelation, Relations, new AjaxOptions  InsertionMode  InsertionMode.Replace, UpdateTargetId  AddRelation , new  id  AddRelationForm     gt codepre  pThe above Begin Form code is used to add Relations to the list instead of the removing them.

Negative 1874 pIm looking for advice, as I havent had to deal with large file parsing before and would like to avoid reinventing the wheel if an open source solution already exists. Heres my situationp  pI have roughly 200300 large XML and text files being dropped in a directory by an automated machine process in the lab I work in. This happens on a regular basis. These files can range in size from a few hundred MB to multiple GBs in size. These files are regularly modified couple times a week at random intervals where the old file is simply overwritten with the modified one.p  pI need the ability to search these files and pull out records that match specific criteria. Of the roughly 2030 million records in the files combined, we might actually use lt 100,000 of them, but we cant tell which ones until they are searched. p  pMy first thought it to setup a sort of regular file processing job that detects updates and processes the files into a database that can be searched. My only concern would be that it would probably get slower and slower to insert and update the records as it got larger and larger. p  pDoes anyone have any suggestions on a method that might be more suitable for my situation Off the top of my head I was thinking some text searching system like Lucene, but having never used it Im not positive if it would be anymore useful than a database...p  pAny help would be much appreciated.p

Negative 1874 pIm writing a few related C classes, and Im having some trouble with the design of a particular inherited function.p  pSpecifically, the classes are all operations on trees, and I need to be able to execute a set of arbitrary tree operations on a tree.

I dont really like this solution because extra1 and extra2 are too dependent on the current state parallelization issues aside, that setup just feels wrong.p  pAlso, wrapping tree, extra1, and extra2 in another structure to pass to ExecuteOperation might make it look cleaner, and makes sense because extra1 and extra2 are extra descriptors for the tree, but I dont know if thats the best solutionp  precodestruct TreeEx       Tree tree     multimapltint,Foogt extra1, extra2  in BasicOperation virtual void ExecuteOperationTreeEx treewithinfo  0 codepre

Negative 1874 pI have a rails app rails 3.1.3 that has a shopping cart model. I wanted to show a summary of the shopping cart in the layout so I created the partial viewscartscart.html.haml. My app was working fine and rendering the cart partial in every view. But when I installed devise 2.0, the partial could no longer be found for devise views. Instead, I would see the following error code when I tried to call a devise viewp  precodeActionViewTemplateError Missing partial viewscartscart with handlersgt[erb, builder, coffee, haml], formatsgt[html], localegt[en, en].

Negative 1874 pIve been banging my head against this for the past two days and cant seem to make any progress... p  pPretty much from one moment to the next, Delphi XE2 wont properly compile one of my projects any more. That is, it actually compiles without errors but at runtime I get resource not found errors for what is essentially the main form its actually a data module in this case. I have already reverted to older versions of the project from source control that I know were definitely working alright but to no avail. Judging by that it seems it must be something inside Delphithe IDE itself rather than in the project source. However, I have also not been able to reproduce the issue with a simple test project nor with any other reallife projects... It only happens with this one.p  pAnother strange thing is that when I look at the produced binary with XN Resource Explorer everything looks as it should The form resource mentioned in the error message is actually there and intact...p  pAt some point I was suspecting this might be caused by a bug in one of the experts I have installed in my IDE e.g. Uwes platform and OI experts and VersionInsightPlus, Andreas IDEFixPack and DDevExtensions, GExperts but even after disabling all these the problem persisted.p  pUnfortunately, I am unable to track down exactly when this started to happen as I had been working for some time without actually running the binary, fixing compiler warnings and errors for the x64target, adjusting build events for updated thirdparty tools localization and license protection and such things...p  pHas anyone else ever seen anything like this happen Any more ideas on how to pin this downp  hr  pSome more details about the projectp  ul liIt is an addin for Outlook built using the AddInExpress framework i.e. a COMDLL.li liThe main form is a codeTDataModulecodedescendant  we also inserted our own ancestorclass into the hierarchy, i.e. the addin module is not directly inheriting from codeTadxCOMAddInModulecode  the resources of the custom ancestor forms also appear to be present and intact in the output binary when checking with a resource viewer.li liBuilt without runtime packages for the Win32 and Win64 platforms.li ul  pLet me know if you think I missed to mention any other potentially relevant details.p  pstrongUpdatestrong  I have now transferred the sources in question onto a different machine. Interestingly, the DLL I compiled there did not exhibit the problem  on that machine that is... when I transfered it back to the original machine and I tried to call it, the error was back to stress this this was the exact same DLL producing a codeEResNotFoundcode on one machine but not on the other. Of course, once I had discovered this, I also performed the reverse test and lo and behold, the DLL compiled on the original machine works without errors on the other machine... Seems this might not be a Delphi problem after all... but what is it thenp  pDifferences between the two machinesp  ul liMachine 1 the one were the problem occurs Windows 7 Ultimate English 64bit with Delphi XE2 Update 4li liMachine 2 Windows 7 Professional German 32bit with Delphi XE2 Update 3li ul  pOn a third machine that is almost identical to the first except that it doesnt have Delphi on it, DLLs produced by both machines work flawlessly.p

Negative 1874 pRecent versions of Google Earth are shipping with a feature called Auto tilt when zooming. If enabled, Google earth automatically tilts the camera towards the horizon as you zoom closer to the surface. This feature can be disabled from within the GUI Preferences  Navigation tab. Unfortunately, I have so far not found a way to disable it for the Google Earth plugin.p  pAseemingly the client setting corresponds to a registry key HKCUSoftwareGoogleGoogle Earth PlusSwoopEnabled. There exists a key of the same name inside the Google Earth Plugin registry branch HKCUSoftwareGoogleGoogleEarthPluginSwoopEnabled, however, assigning the value false to it has no effect at all. It seems the plugin does not evaluate the setting, unlike the client.p  pThere is an API method for disabling the ground level auto transition void GEOptions.setAutoGroundLevelViewEnabledbool, however this does not disable the auto tilt behavior. There is no such method as GEOptions.setSwoopEnabledbool, even though it seems to me that it would make a lot of sense to have one.p  pThe Google Earth API Issue Tracker lists this problem as an issuep  pa hrefhttpcode.google.compearthapisamplesissuesdetailid23 relnofollowhttpcode.google.compearthapisamplesissuesdetailid23ap  pHowever, the entry is from August 2008 and it seems unlikely to me that Google will fix it any time soon.

Negative 1874 pwhat i want to to is analyse input from screen in form of pictures. I want to be able to identify a part of an image in a bigger image and get its coordinates within the bigger picture. Examplep  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.combCkh8.jpg altboxp  pwould have to be located in p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comIK3oa.jpg altbig picturep  pAnd the result would be the upper right corner of the picture in the big picture and the lower left of the part in the big picture. As you can see, the white part of the picture is irrelevant, what i basically need is just the green frame. Is there a library that can do something like this for me Runtime is not really an issue. p  pWhat i want to do with this is just generating a few  random pixel coordinates and recognize the color in the big picture at that position, to recognize the green box fast later. And how would it decrease performance, if the white box in the middle is transparentp  pThe question has been asked several times on SO as it seems without a single answer. I found i found a  solution at a hrefhttpwerner.yellowcouch.orgPaperssubimgindex.htmlhttpwerner.yellowcouch.orgPaperssubimgindex.htmla . Unfortunately its in C and i do not understand a thing. Would be nice to have a Java implementation on SO. p

Negative 1874 pIm building an iPhone and an accompanying iPad application that is using Apples keychain wrapper class to store multiple session cookies from Rails.p  pI am currently running the apps on the simulator. If I login on one app, quit and relaunch simulator, it loads the cookies from keychain correctly and all is fine. And when I log the contents of the keychain data like sop  precodeNSLogValue for keychain data , l d, [self.keychain objectForKeybridge idkSecValueData], [[self.keychain objectForKeybridge idkSecValueData] length] codepre  pIt prints out the contents of the cookies correctly.p  pHowever, if I then launch the other app after having authenticated on the first, then it crashes at line 305p  precodeNSAssert result  noErr, Couldnt add the Keychain Item.  codepre  pWith this error in outputp  precodeAssertion failure in [KeychainItemWrapper writeToKeychain], mydirectoryClassesModelsKeychainKeychainItemWrapper.m305 codepre  pAnd the NSLog of the keychain data says that it is entirely empty.p  pThe keychain identifier is unique for each app. I also looked at a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions7989258ioskeychainsecitemaddreturns25243this threada  however I have set the access group to nil, and more importantly this comment in the KeychainItemWrapper explains that in the simulator this is skipped anywayp  blockquote   p Apps that are built for the simulator arent signed, so theres no   keychain access group for the simulator to check. This means that all   apps can see all keychain items when run on the simulator.p blockquote  pSo by the looks of things, if I login onto one app, I can quit and relaunch many times over and it loads perfectly. However once I log onto the other, the first app has its keychain wiped, so it goes to login screen where you attempt to login and fetch a new cookie, but then crashes because it cant add the keychain item. The only way to fix it is to Reset the simulator.p

Negative 1874 pThis question has pertinence beyond my own case because anyone who has a localized application and has to deliver a standalone EXE has this problem they will want to use ILMerge or Costura or some homebrew solution to put localization DLLs or any other assembly into their EXE but once they do that, they can no longer debug their code.  The VS debugger will just refuse to accept the original PDB file generated for the original EXE, presumably because the ILMerge step either updates the checksum or changes the GUID.p  pWhat I wonder is if theres any way around this.. like some little known ILMerge option, maybe  It strikes me as a very common and unnecessary loss of debugging ability.p  pI believe the only other way to debug such an app after localization is to maintain a parallel build option that uses the DLLs unILMerged, which is fine, unless you happen to want to debug the localization code itself for example, me.. then youre really out of luck.  Can anyone think of other optionsp  pI also tried using Costura, but because localization DLLs all contain resources that are identically named and are identical to the main resource AppName.resource, you can only add one such DLL to the References subsequent ones are not allowed.  Is there some way to gimmick Costura into working if it could be made to work though, the PDB problem might not occur as the combination is part of the the visual studio build..p  pEdit Im looking for ideas that result in a PDBEXE match.  I realize you can hack the pdb in a hex editor.  The question specifically asks about ways to make the system work as intended, though.p

Negative 1874 pI am working on my capstone and we are developing an app that gets a user location and plots this on a map. We are trying to get the location every x variable x being a setting the user inputs from a selection of 5, 10, 15, 30, and 60 minutes and send the best location to a database for sharing later. The app basic flow is that every time the user opens the app they see a map and it displays their current location ASAP. The location is then sent to a database to share with other people. After they get the location a timer is started that gets their location again every, lets say they want 30 minutes, and then sends that location to the DB and starts the timer again. The timer needs to reset every time the user accesses the application because they will immediately get their location upon starting the app. The problem I am having is creating a timer in the background that will get their location while not in the app to send to the DB. I also want to implement logic that says after we get their location, we stop listening for updates for a small amount of time.p  pI currently understand the requestLocationUpdates method and have implemented it so as a user accesses the app, they get a location both from GPS and NETWORK and it has a min time of 60 seconds and a distance of 100ft or 30.48 meters. This also stops when a user pauses the app and starts when a user navigates back to the app. I notice though we keep requesting updates even though we have already received an update. This leaves me to believe that the requestLocationUpdates is continuing to use battery life as it is listening for update changes.p  pHow do I create this logic to stop updating after a location is received but then start listening for a location after a certain time Reading the current android method of requestLocationUpdates, the minTime and minDistance are just hints but it doesnt obey them. I need the locationUpdater to obey set parameters.p  precodeOverride public void onCreateBundle savedInstanceState      super.onCreatesavedInstanceState      Session Creation and Checker      session  new SessionManagementgetApplicationContext      Check if the user is logged in     session.checkLogin       Setup basic session and content view       Set the Content View     setContentViewR.layout.activitymain      Start of the MapView Elements       extract MapView from layout     mapView  MapView findViewByIdR.id.mapview      Set a mapController     mapController  mapView.getController      set the map to have built in zoom controls     mapView.setBuiltInZoomControlstrue       Getting the device location      locationManager  LocationManager getSystemServiceLOCATIONSERVICE     geoCoder  new Geocoderthis      isEnabled  locationManager             .isProviderEnabledLocationManager.GPSPROVIDER      Check if the GPS is enabled     if isEnabled          alert.showAlertDialogMainActivity.this, 12            Retrieve a list of location providers that have fine accuracy, no      monetary cost, etc     Criteria criteria  new Criteria     criteria.setAccuracyCriteria.ACCURACYHIGH     criteria.setAltitudeRequiredfalse     criteria.setBearingRequiredfalse     criteria.setCostAllowedtrue     criteria.setPowerRequirementCriteria.POWERLOW     provider  locationManager.getBestProvidercriteria, true       If no suitable provider is found, null is returned.     if provider  null          provider  locationManager.getBestProvidercriteria, false         BCT  session.getBCT  60000          Initialize with last known location         locationManager.requestLocationUpdatesprovider, BCT, 31,                 locationListener           Check the map settings         if session.isSatellite              SatelliteChecked  true             mapView.setSatellitetrue                  if session.isTraffic              TrafficChecked  true             mapView.setTraffictrue               else          alert.showAlertDialoggetApplicationContext, 15         locationManager.removeUpdateslocationListener          Define a listener that responds to location updates LocationListener locationListener  new LocationListener      public void onLocationChangedLocation location           Called when a new location is found by the network location          provider.

Negative 1874 pI have a table that has product, datetime, and price. I split out the datetime to another column where I just split out the hour part of it. I need to find highlowopenclose of the price value by hour. I can get the highlow easy enough by doing a subselect in the select portion where I maxmin and join the data by product amp hr. I now need the openclose which will be the first record for each hour and the last record for each hour. highlowopenclose should all be the same for each record by hour.p  pExample result. notice how the high for all hour 7 records is 55 so thats what placed in all the hour 7 records, the low is 30 because its the lowest of all hour 7 records, 50 is the open because the first price sorted by datetime at 715 is 50. Close is the last price in the hour sorted by datetime which is 30.p  precodeProduct, Date,            Hour, Price, High, Low, Open, Close A,       11122012 715, 7,    50,    55,   30,  50,   30 A,       11122012 728, 7,    55,    55,   30,  50,   30 A,       11122012 730, 7,    40,    55,   30,  50,   30 A,       11122012 735, 7,    45,    55,   30,  50,   30 A,       11122012 755, 7,    30,    55,   30,  50,   30 codepre  pSo again to recap, highlow is easy as I do subselects in the select part that query against the same table doing maxmin, but not sure how to do the same thing for openclose to get the first and last records based on datetime field.p

Negative 1874 pIm trying to create an Android App which would allow my Galaxy SIII to connect to my Arduino Board through Bluetooth using a eBay cheap module I just bought. Thing is, I cant figure out how to make a proper connection and such.p  pI looked lots of things over the internet, found dozens of source codes, but I still dont understand how it works I might be dumb, at least a little bit. Some of the source codes I found are very complicated with lots of possibility, and Im still in the learning process.

For example  First you need to activate Bluetooth and enable the discovery, then to create a socket ... stuff like that. Im obviously willing to have more information than what is written above. Dunno if willing is very polite, English isnt, as you might have seen, my mother tongue.p  pFor now, I managed to activate bluetooth when checking a checkbox, or if the bluetooth is already enabled, my app check automatically the checkbox. Well what I did is pretty basic, still it works.p  pMy project is basically to send a letter or some letters to my Arduino so that it can interpret it and switch on and off a LED pretty simple. And since Im curious and eager to learn, I want to develop my own app instead of using an already existing one.p  pIn advance, thanks for your time, and thanks for reading my whole message  Have a good day p  pPS  My code goes like that  a hrefhttppastebin.comk9sSGTuC relnofollowhttppastebin.comk9sSGTuCap

Negative 1874 pI have an abstract class Ap  pI have about 10 classes that extend Ap  pClass A has one or two static methods and it makes sense that these are static, because they belong to the 10 classes, NOT instances of them. One static method e.g. is called getAllFromX, which gets all all instances of the class from X, whatever that may be, it may be a server, well it actually is, but it doesnt matter. So you see it makes sense these methods are static and are not bound to an instance.p  pAt the same time class A has a NONstatic abstract method, each subclass overrides this method just returns a string. I cannot make it static because static methods cannot be overridden ....p  pTo summarize abstract class A has a static method and a abstract nonstatic method, that is overriden by the subclasses. I cannot make the second method static because it must be overriden. On the otherhand I could make the first method nonstatic, but it would be very ugly and bad programming style, so Ill leave it that way.p  pThe catch The static method in class A must get the value the nonstatic method returns for the subclass the static method is inherited from, of course.p  pIs the easiest way to use reflection to get this done I mean...reallyp  pLike e.g., I get the class the static method is inp  precodeClassltgt clnew Object.getClass.getEnclosingClass a hack I found here, thank god... codepre  pI then use getConstructor to construct an object of this subclass.p  pAnd then I use this object to call the nonstatic method.p  pReally Can it not be done easier I mean that is if I want to design my program conceptually correct...p  pComing from C I dont like that and the type erasure thing. It is just ugly. Doable but ugly. And a big stumbling block, at least for beginners. EDIT after reading it again, Id add rant end. Sorry, but I actually care.p

Negative 1874 pI am in the process of building a REST API for mobile app developers to be used on a web application built using Zend framework. My first task is to create a service for authenticationauthorization. I have read lots of related questions here on SO and would like to sum up what I am doingp  ol liThere is no session or cookie involved, so a typical web app method of checking the logged in state of the user doesnt work here.li liWith each login request, the username and password is received and a random string is generated and saved in the DB against the username. Also, this string is returned with the authentication request.li liThis user token is sent along with any request that needs authentication.This token is matched against the stored value in DB and if matched, only then the user is allowed to perform the required task. li liOn logout, the token value in the DB is reset to blank or NULL.li ol  pIs this the correct approach  Wont it over load the DB because with each request, a select query is run on the DB to check for the token value  If you could provide any tutorial link, thatd be much appreciated.p

Its very good quality, actually  too good. All those fine spectrographic colorpallet levels are drawn in vectors. Hence, if I embed it in LaTeX, it slows down everything horribly. If I open it in Illustrator and want to make some adjustments  it slows down everything horribly. But I cant make it into PNG or other bitmap format, because the quality will be too low, and I wont be able to make some finishing touches in Illustrator.p  pAny suggestions how can I decrease the size of this graphics, but still keep it vectorp

Negative 1874 pI currently have a TFS structure set to allow me to do continuous integration.

An then I have 10s of web project WebProject1, 2, 3.... referencing BasebindebugBase.dllp  pIn order to validate that a check in on the project strongBase.dllstrong does not break a thing in my web projects, the build definition of theses projects include strongBase.dllstrong both in their workspace and in their Items to build in the process.p  pAs I said this works quite well. If I screw up a check in, every build fail. Good to know.p  pNow lets imagine I want strongBase.dllstrong to depend on strongCache.dllstrong.

Negative 1874 pthis is a passage from JavaDoc regarding codeConcurrentHashMapcode. It says retrieval operations generally do not block, so may overlap with update operations. Does this mean the codegetcode method is not thread safep  blockquote   pHowever, even though all operations are threadsafe, retrieval   operations do not entail locking, and there is not any support for   locking the entire table in a way that prevents all access. This class   is fully interoperable with Hashtable in programs that rely on its   thread safety but not on its synchronization details.p      pRetrieval operations including get generally do not block, so may   overlap with update operations including put and remove. Retrievals   reflect the results of the most recently completed update operations   holding upon their onset.p blockquote
Negative 1874 pIm using the Microsoft Fakes testing framework. Theres not much way around it as I need to use the shimmoles approach due to legacy code that I cannot change. Its code from a vendor with no source, it was written without testing in mind. So Im stuck with 3 possible frameworks, TypeMock expensive, Teleriks JustMock expensive or Microsofts Fakes. As we already have VS Ultimate, were opting for the fakes. As most people feel they need to suggest rewriting or modifying the code in some way to support using interfaces andor dependency injection Ill tell you up front, this is not an option.p  pOne of the issues Im having is that the library Im attempting to fake is huge and requires the use of the 64 bit version of fakes.exe and not the 32 bit fakes.x86.exe, it runs into the memory limit of 32 bit apps.p  pThe second issue is that I need to compile the fakes library using the v4.5 framework. Its possible through the command line, though undocumented. The reason is that in v4.5 they added the IReadOnly interfaces in System.Collections.Generic and the library uses them. Compiling with v4, throws an error stating the types are not found, as expected.p  pThe problem, Visual Studio is always using the x86 version and v4.0 framework and I cant find a way to override it. Does anybody know how to get it to use the 64 bit and v4.5 framework My current idea is to not use visual studios builtin stuff and just use the command line and manually reference the file. Then on every update of the dll, we would manually recreate it and update the reference. This file does not get updated very often so that is a possibility.p  pThe command line I use to manually generate the fakes library someone might find this useful is p  precodecProgram Files x86MSBuildMicrosoftVisualStudiov11.0fakesfakes.exe ltassemblygt tfvv4.5 codepre  pThe help command only shows that v2, v3.5 and v4 are possible options for tfv, but just for kicks I tried v4.5.p  pI have tried forcing the architecture on the app to x64 instead of any cpu, no change in which fakes.exe it ran. Looked in the .csproj file for the test, no change. Looked in the .csproj file that fakes.exe and it says to use v4 of the framework, opened in visual studio, changed to v4.5, compiled fine. Used the fakes command line, compiled fine. There is an attribute in the .fakes file in the project that allows the compiler version to be defined, but setting it to v4.5 still didnt work.

Negative 1874 pIm trying to create an application that would stay awake as long as the user chooses it to  and it would even stay awake in the case of an orientation change.p  pInitially I did this by creating a wake lock when the user decides that the application should stay awake, and then releasing this lock at onPause, so that it is not held on to forever. but, when there is a change in orientation, the activity in question is destroyed and a new one is created  and I dont see a way to hand over the wake lock to the new instance.p  pof course one could save it in the saved instance state  but at the time the activity is destroyed, one doesnt know if its for the reason of an orientation change, or if it destroyed for good.p  pis there a generic way to achieve thisp

Negative 1874 pIm in the process of heavily customising one of those premade forums, and one of the things I am trying to do is to replace the onlineoffline graphics with something else, and reposition them, so that instead of being positioned at the end of the user name, it is positioned in the left corner of that part of a post.p  pMy intention was to get the img code within div tags assigned with a style of floatleft, and positionabsolute need to use absolute, otherwise the other elements, such as the user name and avatar will become offcentered. Currently, this is what I havep  pa hrefhttpimg849.imageshack.usimg849635718555863.gif relnofollowhttpimg849.imageshack.usimg849635718555863.gifap  pAs you can see, there appears to be some sort of padding or margin that I have been unable to get past. I have tried adding a style to the div for margin0px, padding0px, left0px, and top0px, but none of them have been able to move the image into the right place that is, to close that gap between the edges of the image, and the border of the table cell.p
Negative 1874 pI have a unique constraint on a SQL server 2008 database table, with the constraint containing 4 columns. While entering in some test data, I unexpectedly received a unique constraint violation. For the four columns I was just entering in a number, inserting the value set, incrementing the number, then repeating i.e. 1,1,1,1 2,2,2,2,... etc.. The violation occurred when I got to 10. If I enter any number now, it will violate the constraint. I then tried it entering just the letter A, and tried to insert any words beginning with A, which led to a violation.

Negative 1874 pI am not new to programming but new to C. I am now working on a rather complex project involving control of a simulated robotic arm. I finished a first version of the project and it is working fine.

Negative 1874 pDoing collision and just finished boundingbox and boundingsphere, what other methods of collision are therep
Negative 1874 pNormally I would use SignalR to handle any data pushing but in this case Im using a selfhosted instance of Nancy Async Beta on the server end. Ive heard its still possible to use SignalR in this scenario but I would still prefer to handle the longpolling myself in this case. Here is the code from a simple experiment app Im writing that produces the issue described belowp  precode        Get[receivechat, true]  async x, ct gt                              string result  await massPublisher.WaitForResulttest                 return result              codepre  pThis handles the actual longpolling requests. The requests seem to enter this lambda in chunks of 4 or 5. So for example if I put a break point on the very first line of the lambda I wont see that breakpoint get hit until I send in 4 or 5 more requests and then suddenly all of the requests enter the lambda all at once. Obviously I need them to all enter as theyre requested so they can all await my WaitForResult method. The WaitForResult method simply awaits a common TaskCompletionSource. I can post that code and the clientside code if necessary. As far as I can tell its seems to be a problem with how Im using Nancy Async Beta since the requests are being handled in parallel and the requests wont even enter the lambda until a few other requests are made. p  pIts probably note worthy that this application is still responsive to all other requests during this time.p  pIve read the a hrefhttpsgithub.comNancyFxNancywikiAsyncBeta relnofollowdocumentationa I can find on Nancy Async Beta and it looks like this example should work...but its not  for me anyway. If anyone can offer some insight on why this doesnt work it would be much appreciated. And like I said I can post more code from this experiment but for now it seemed it would just clutter the question.p  pstrongUpdatestrong Since Im relatively new to the TPL and Nancy Ive taken my code out of the experiment in order to isolate the issue and troubleshoot a little more. Here is the code Ive updated to. It simply awaits a Task Delay of 5 seconds and then sends the current time to the client.p  precode        Get[receivechat, true]  async x, ct gt                              string result  await massPublisher.WaitForResulttest                 return result                 await Task.Delay5000                 return DateTime.Now.ToString              codepre  pMy understanding is that each request will be processed in parallel and independent of each other. Now with that understanding I would think each client should see a reply every 5 seconds regardless of how many other clients are polling those requests. However, here are the resultsp  h2img srchttpi.stack.imgur.com97tw3.png altasync illustrationh2  pSo in other words, a response is sent every 5 seconds but only to one client at a time. So for 3 clients it takes each client 15 seconds to receive its response. For 2  10 seconds etc...p  pSo far I cant see what Im doing wrong. Which is why Im here. I love finding out Im wrong  Ill get to learn something new. So if you know or may know where Im going wrong please let me know. Ive probably missed something small and dumb that Ive overlooked while looking for it many times amp hopefully its a mistake that other people will find useful.p

Negative 1874 pIm working on code that uses BSD file descriptors to read and write values from and to a pipe with the codereadcode and codewritecode calls. This is part of a simple IPC system where one process tells another to run a procedure and return a result. Most of the time there is only one return value, but a few procedures need to return more than one. In order to avoid having to do a new codestructcode for each of them, I thought I could use codestdtuplecodes.p  pHowever, I had very little success creating a general way to read elements into a tuple. I am trying to read the values individually because the two processes dont have the same bitness one is 64 bits and the other is 32 bits, and Im concerned about different alignment requirements in the codetuplecode structs that could cause them to be incompatible. This is what I triedp  precodetemplatelttypename TTupleTypegt struct TupleReader      int fd     TTupleTypeamp storage      TupleReaderint fd, TTupleTypeamp storage  fdfd, storagestorage            templateltsizet Index  stdtuplesizeltTTupleTypegtvalue  1gt     inline void Read              ReadltIndex  1gtfd         autoamp ref  stdgetltIndexgtstorage         readfd, ampref, sizeof ref       codepre  pIt obviously doesnt compile, because it tries to instantiate codeReadlt1gtcode and the implementation of the STL I use catches codestdgetlt1gtcode with a codestaticassertcode. However, its illegal to specialize a templated function in a class scope, but since the parent codestructcode is templated as well, its not possible to specialize the method outside either. codetemplatelttypename TTupleReadergt void TupleReaderltTTupleTypegtReadlt0gtcode is considered a partial specialization.p  pSo it looks like Im caught in limbo with this approach. Does anyone see a way to do itp

Negative 1874 pLong story short I have written a program that allows me to install software and run commands on Windows machines remotely.  I have been using the START command which i learned about from another post on stackoverflow found a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions1449188runningwindowsbatchfilecommandsasynchronouslyherea to execute the batch file through RPC so that my server doesnt have to wait for the install to finish.  It works fine on most of the 1000 computers at the school district I wrote this for, but I have a few computers that the START doesnt run the batch file.  I am not getting any error messages and all of the searching I have done only finds more examples of how to use the START command.  I have not been able to find any references to it simply not running.p  pMy server is linux and is using winexe for the RPC.  Here is the command that I am running.p  precodewinexe W domain U adminUser passwordadminPassword compName.domain.internal runasdomainadminUseradminPassword ServerPathToBatchrun.cmd ServerPathToBatchinstall.cmd codepre  pThe run.cmd code is below.p  precodeSTART 1 exit codepre  pThe install.cmd batch file is generated by my program depending on what they want to install.  The extra s in the command are escape characters because the  is the escape character in linux.p  pThe output I get is.p  precodeCWINDOWSsystem32gtstart ServerPathToBatchinstall.cmd  CWINDOWSsystem32gtexit codepre  pNo error messages, and the output is the same on a computer that does start correctly.p  pI have tried running the command from a command prompt on the machine exactly as it is run through RPC and it works fine.  I can run the install.cmd by its self using RPC and it works fine except I have to wait for the install to finish.  The exact same batch files can be run on other computers without problems.p  pWatching Task Manager on a computer that works I can see a cmd process run by the adminUser start and then start a second cmd process and the first goes away.  On a non working computer it starts the first cmd process and goes away without the second cmd process ever starting.p  pI have not been able to find any differences between the working computer and non working computer.  There is no firewall on the computers.p  pWe will be reimaging these computers during summer break and I expect they will probably start working after that, so it isnt urgent that I figure this out.  I mainly want to know why it isnt working so that I can prevent it from failing in the future on other machines.  p  pThanks in advance for any help you can give me.p

Negative 1874 pWe are having an issue with a pair of ListView controls in WPF, these controls are linked together to work as a single grid with a frozen column on the right hand side which contains a checkbox. This is so that the left hand section will be scrollable but the right checkbox will always remain on the screen. p  pWe also have a number of datatriggers which are required to set the visual state in the customized listview style. This is used to highlight the background colour of the selected rows we also have a selected item style.p  pWe have chosen to use datatriggers to fire the viusal states, rather than setting the background colour of the row as this doesnt give us the required control over the design.p  pThe issue we are currently experiencing is related to scrolling the ListView when it contains a large

Negative 1874 pIve created a new model and renamed 2 fields of an entity. This entity was never used in the previous app version, so I didnt map it to the new updated entity in the database.

Negative 1874 pIm trying to plot multiple overlaying density plots for two vectors on the same figure. As far as I know, Im not able to do so unless they are in the same object.p  pIn order to plot the data, I need to have a data.frame with two columns one for the value, and one to specify which vector each value belongs to.p  pMy first vector contains 400 data. The second contains 1200. My current somewhat inelegant solution involves concatenating the two vectors into a new data.frame vector, and adding a second vector to the data.frame which contains 400 as and 1200 bs, to indicate which vector the original data came from. This only works because I know how many data there were in each original vector.p  pSurely there must be a more efficient way to do thisp  pLets say my original data are from codedframe1vectorcode and codedframe2vectorcode.

Negative 1874 pThanks to the great a hrefhttpweblogs.asp.netdwahlinarchive20130522dynamicallyloadingcontrollersandviewswithangularjsandrequirejs.aspxarticle from Dan Wahlina, I managed to implement lazy loading of Angulars controllers and services.  However, there does not seem to be a clean way to lazy load independent modules.p  pTo better explain my question, assume that I have an app would be structure as below without RequireJSp  precode Create independent module dataServices module with Pictures object angular.moduledataServices, [].factoryPictures, function ... ...   Create webapp ngapp, with dependency to dataServices, defining controllers angular.modulewebapp, [dataServices] .controllerView1Controller, function ... ... .controllerView2Controller, function ... ... codepre  pHere is the sample app with RequireJS in Plunkerbr a hrefhttpplnkr.coaiarzVpMJchYPjFRrkwnhttpplnkr.coaiarzVpMJchYPjFRrkwnap  pThe core of the problem is that Angular does not allow adding dependency to codengappcode post instantiation.  As result, my solution is to use codeangular.injectorcode to retrieve the instance of codePicturecode object to be used in my codeView2Controllercode. See codejsscriptscontrollersctrl2.jscode file.p  pThis creates 2 problems for mep  ol liThe injected services runs outside of angular and therefore all async call must end with scope.applyli liMessy code where some object can be injected using standard angular syntax while others require the explicit use of injector.li ol  pHave any of you figured out how to lazy load independent module using RequireJS and somehow hook this module in angular so normal angular dependency injection syntax can be usedp  pstrongNotestrongbr The question is on lazy loading of emindependent moduleem.  One simple solution to this specific example is to create Pictures object using cached providers during codengapp.configcode but that is not what I am looking for.  I am looking for solution that works with 3rd party module such as codeangularresourcecode.p

Negative 1874 pThere are a few questions out there on this topic, but my question is very specific to true self referencing.

There are a lot of questions on the matter that involve a new entity that refers another new entity that has a foreign key on the first entity, which is a circular reference. The solution in those cases is either save one of entities first or to have a nullable id on the circular entity foreign key. I can not do either of those because the first would be impossible and the second is a external constraint that I cannot have nullable ids.p  pSo, seeing how I can achieve this by adding a entry manually I can assume its a limitation of EF5.

Negative 1874 pI aim to create the strongeasiest login experiencestrong possible for the users of my Django site.

But now is the million dollars question.p  pstrongIf they change how they do the login, how do I emautomaticallyem associate their Google, FB and local accountsstrong p  pSee that any way they login, I have their email address. Is it possible to do it using djangoallauth I know I can do it with a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions13140021djangoallauthlinkingmultiplesocialaccountstoasingleuser1935363219353632user interventiona. Today the default behavior is to refuse the login saying that the email is already registered.p  pIf it isnt possible to do just with configuration, Ill accept the answer that gives me some orientation about which modifications should I make in allauth code to support this workflow.p  pThere are a lot of reasons to do this. The users will forget which method they used to authenticate, and will sometimes use Google, sometimes FB and sometimes the local user account. We already have a lot of local user accounts and social accounts will be a new feature. I want the users to maintain their identity. I envision the possibility to ask for the user friends list, so if they logged using Google, Id like to also have their FB account. p  pIt is a hobby site, there isnt great security requirements, so please dont answer that this isnt a wise security implementation. p  pLater, Id create a a hrefhttpsdocs.djangoproject.comendevtopicsauthcustomizingsubstitutingacustomusermodelcustom user modela to have just the email as the login id. But Ill be happy with an answer that just let me automatically associate a accounts of the default user model that has a required username. p  pIm using Django1.5.4 and djangoallauth0.13.0p

Ill start by explaining the problem I was having because the immediate answer would be that it isnt a very good class design.p  pI have a class which was shaping up to be an unmaintainable blob of if statements when I tried to turn it into a composite I began being more confused about getting the deep copies to work than I was with the original blob, as well as general small object allocation problems.

Negative 1874 pI am very new to Android development and Im trying to figure out the best way to achieve the following goalp  pI want to have a main menu that holds several buttons. Each of those buttons should load a second Activity and pass some data to this Activity. p  pThe Secondary Activity should display a tabbar that switches between three different views or activities 1. A static view created for each element button on main menu 2. An image gallery with a set of images associated with that element 3. Another page with dynamic content like a map and images.p  pMy thought Create a json file for each element and pass the name of that file to the Secondary Activity with could then create the views using that data. p  pProblem Can you store the name of a layout.xml file as a string and then load itp  pSo what would be the best Practice to approach thisp

Negative 1874 pI am storing many chunks of base64 encoded 64bit doubles in an XML file. The double data all looks similar.p  pThe double data is currently being compressed using the java Deflate algorithm before the encoding, however each chunk of binary data in the file will have its own deflate data dictionary, which is an overhead I would like to greatly lessen. The Deflater class has a setDictionary method which I would like to use.p  pSo questions arep  p1. Does anyone have any suggestions for how to best build my own single custom data dictionary based on multiple sections of doubles x8 bytes that could he used for multiple deflate operations, i.e. use the same dictionary for all the compressions Should I be looking for common bytes across all byte arrays, with the commonest byte put at the end of the dictionary arrayp  p2. Can I separate the custom data dictionary from the deflated data, and then set the dictionary against the deflated data later before inflating the data againp  p3. Will the deflate algorithm take my custom data dictionary, and then just create its own slightly different data dictionary anyway, both invalidating my singular data dictionary and lessening the potential space saving from using a singular data dictionaryp  p4. Can someone elaborate on the structure of zlib compressed data, so that I myself may try to separate the data dictionary from the compressed datap  pI want to only use space for the data dictionary once in my file, and use it for each block of my double data in my filebut not store it with the double data. If the data dictionary cannot be separated from the deflated datastored separately, then it seems that there would be little value in building a custom singular dictionary as each compressed block would have its own dictionary anyway. Is this rightp

Negative 1874 pSo I have a project that I have been working on for 9 months. I have 30 view controllers in the storyboard.  Each codeUIViewControllercode in storyboard has a navigationBar on top and in this bar I have a codeUIButtoncode as the title so that its clickable. I also have a cancel button Button Bar Item on each view. Everything is working fine, meaning I can click the codeUIButtoncode used as a  title and change the text at will. I can also change the text of the ButtonBarItem aka cancel button. p  pSo today I decide I need another codeUIViewControllercode so in storyboard I copy and paste an existing one. Now I go to click the codeUIButtoncode title and it will not let me select it. It keeps selecting the top level codeUIViewcode no matter how many times I clickp  pSo I decide I will go to the view navigator and click on the title button there. So that works fine. But, when I run my app only the title codeUIButtoncode shows up not the Cancel button. And yes they are all linked correctly through cntrl dragging.p  pAnyone have a cluep  pNow if I create a new codeUIViewControllercode from scratch by dragging one on the screen and then I set the top navbar to a translucent bar then drag a codeUIButtoncode to the navigation bar and let go to make it a title, storyboards puts it in the main level view. It will not let me put anything in the navigation barp  pIs this something new in Xcode 5p

Negative 1874 precodelt Some place on the webpage gt   ltinput typetext idfirstNamegt  lt Some other place on the same webpage, or maybe content ajaxed in later gt   ltinput typetext idfirstNamegt codepre  pLets say I have a serverside script that generates an HTML page with some input fields each with its own ID. One serverside class may be responsible for adding input fields to one part of the webpage while another class handles another part of the webpage. Or you might have different programmers working on different parts of the page. I want to avoid collision with the HTML input field IDs. An example of this could be a parent form that has a jQuery dialog popup with input field IDs the same as the parent. Currently, I am prefixing the IDs with the name of the serverside class that generates them and an underscore to make it clear which part is the prefix. To get a fully unique ID this way, I might have to start including the full namespace of the serverside class, and this might make my IDs very long. p  pstrongIs there a better approach than prefixing the inputs or what is the best practice for thisstrong I normally use camelCase for all my variables, with only this exception. Is this a good exception for breaking that rule p  pWhat are most of you doing Are you altering the way you select these input fields instead of by ID Wrapping the input fields in codeformcode tags or codedivcode tags and adding functionality to the serverside to create these Id like to have the freedom of not restricting what I wrap these inputs in to select them. My serverside code should just generate clientside code that grabs the values only knowing those inputs are going onto the page, and not knowing about any other tags on the page. Much easier to manage. Are you adding css classes to each group of fieldsp

Negative 1874 pI am taking on a project with a ton of jQuery functions and of course it is a bit confusing to me at the moment. It seems like, if the functions were broken down into javascript functions then called with jQuery, the code might be more readable. What are the advantages to doing this and why might I not do thisp  pFor instance, right now there might be a function like thisp  precodedocument.onclick, function     var foo  1     var bar  2     var sum  foo  bar     console.logsum  codepre  pBut to me it seems like itd be easier if it were like thisp  precodefunction addStuff     var foo  1     var bar  2     var sum  foo  bar     console.logsum   document.onclick, function     addStuff  codepre  pI feel like this would make it more readable but Im not sure if this is good convention, bad convention, or just developers choice.p

Some of the other questions gave reasons, but they were so technical, I could not understand what they were attempting to explainp  pIf no, why notp  pstrongNotestrong While reading some similar Stack Overflow questions, I noticed a hrefhttpsdevelopers.google.comspeedarticlesoptimizingphp relnofollowthis posta written by Google developers.p  blockquote   pAvoid writing naive setters and getters When writing classes in PHP, you can save time and speed up your scripts by working with object properties directly, rather than writing naive setters and getters. In the following example, the dog class uses the setName and getName methods for accessing the name property.p      pSetting and calling the name property directly can run up to 100 faster, as well as cutting down on development time.p blockquote  pGoogle provided a hrefhttppastie.org63873213,15 relnofollowproofa as to the speed impact that using them will have on your code.p

Negative 1874 pI am building an app which mainly shows a tableview. In this tableview I have some custom table rows. The table rows are filled with data received from the server. I receive multiple kinds of data from the server. I will store it in arrays. p  pFor example, Ive got three kinds of arrays. Each is filled with different kinds of data received from the server. See belowp  precodeNSArraycarList NSArraymotorcycleList NSArraybicycleList codepre  pThe actual program that Ive got now, only shows the carList in the tableview. Foreach car in carList, there is a table row.p  pThe thing that Ive in mind to do is a little bit tricky. I want to add a tabbar at the bottom of the screen with three buttons. When I press the first button, I want the table to be filled with the carList. When I press the second button, I want to fill the table with the motorcycleList. And when I press the third button, I want to fill the table with the bicycleList.p  pAs you can see, I will use the same tableview. I will only refill it with the data I want to see. strongIs this allowed in iOSstrong Cause I read something about that the tabbar is for multiple views, and I only want to use it for changing the data in my table. Only the fourth button Ive planned for future development will open a new view. If it is not allowed, what is a good alternative do do it Buttons maybe I searched the web for what I want to do, but it seems that my idea has never been used before, I think my idea is not allowed in iOS.p  pAt this moment Ive a initialViewController with almost no code cause  it is used only to initialize some things of the server. It acts like a splash screen and Ive got a rootViewController which does the works. In the rootViewController Ive got my Table with Table rows and it has the different arrays of data which are retrieved by a method that is called when the rootViewController is loaded.p  pI am programming without Storyboards, because Id like coding and I want to understand how it works underground. What is a good way to implement the tabbar if it is allowed what I want to do with it I dont think a standard tab controller will work, because I am working with only one view.p

Negative 1874 pI already asked on question earlier about the string function strstr, and it just turned out that I had made a stupid mistake.  Now again im getting unexpected results and cant understand why this is.  The code ive written is just a simple test code so that I can understand it better, which takes a text file with a list of 11 words and im trying to find where the first word is found within the rest of the words.  All ive done is move the text document words into a 2D array of strings, and picked a few out that I know should return a correct value but are instead returning NULL.  The first use of strstr returns the correct value but the last 3, which I know include the word chant inside of them, return NULL.

Negative 1874 pIm trying to determine the best practices for storing and displaying user input in MongoDB. Obviously, in SQL databases, all user input needs to be encoded to prevent injection attacks. However, my understanding is that with MongoDB we need to be more worried about XSS attacks, so does user input need to be encoded on the server before being stored in mongo Or, is it enough to simply encode the string immediately before it is displayed on the client side using a template library like handlebarsp  pHeres the flow Im talking aboutp  ol liOn the client side, user updates their name to ltscriptgtalertx27hix27ltx2Fscriptgt. ul liDoes this need to be escaped to ampltscriptampgtalertampx27hiampx27ampltampx2Fscriptampgt before sending it to the serverli ulli liThe updated string is passed to the server in a JSON document via an ajax request.li liThe server stores the string in mongodb under user.name. ul liDoes the server need to escape the string in the same way just to be safe Would it have to first unescape the string before fully escaping so as to not double up on the ampli ulli liLater, user info is requested by client, and the name string is sent in JSON ajax response.li liImmediately before display, user name is encoded using something like .escapename.li ol  pWould this flow display the correct information and be safe from XSS attacks What about about unicode characters like Chinese charactersp  pThis also could change how text search would need to be done, as the search term may need to be encoded before starting the search if all user text is encoded.p  pThanks a lotp

Negative 1874 pI have a legacy system written in C and built using Visual C 6.  It is an MFC 4.2 application that is multithreaded and makes use of ATL COM objects to implement a plugin architecture.p  p2 or 3 times a year the release build will display the R6025  pure virtual function call popup.  This has never been reproduced in a development or test environment.  When this appears on the server application clients maintain their connections but any data is not updated with the exception of the time.  The time is the only data point not sourced from the plugin system.  This would suggest the equipment manager object see below is being blocked by the popup.  Since this has not been reproducible offsite I have updated the installation to include the PDBs and given the onsite engineer instructions on how to produce a stack trace of all running threads at the point when the dialog pops up.p  pI was hoping that the stack trace would show where the pure call originates however the thread that shows the pure call pop up starts with the pure call itself.p  pI have read various causes of this outside of the most common calling virtual function from a constructordestructor and the most likely cause would seem to be accessing a COM object that has been released.  The equipment manager hosts a thread for each resource COM ports basically and each thread will continuously query the handful of plugin objects that share it for their poll ratio which requires a query interface  release to occur.  However, there should be no cross thread activity and using ATLDEBUGINTERFACES confirms it.  This is, of course, in the development environment and the problem isnt occuring in this instance.p  pWhat Im looking for is any ideas on how to figure out why this pure call error is happening.  I have tried redefining the pure call function in but this only traps simulated calls in the main application, plugins still go to the pop up.  I cant set the pure call handler because it is VC6.

Negative 1874 pI have this issue which I have possibly overcomplicated in my head. Ive been at it for a long time now and I would appreciate if someone could give me some direction.p  pSo what Im trying to do, is map coordinates on an image taken from the sky, to a coordinate on a flat surface on the ground. This is fine from directly above a point, I can just scale my coordinates by some factor calculated using basic trigonometry. p  pThe problem is if the camera was at an angle. p  pa hrefhttpi61.tinypic.com359wsok.png relnofollowhttpi61.tinypic.com359wsok.pnga [Note, Height is the Z axis here]p  pI hope my diagram makes sense. The centre line the one which ends at x2,y2 bisects the 2 other lines i.e. each of the outer lines are 12a degrees from the centre one. I understand that this could get very complicated. The more horizontal the camera points, the more surface is going to be in view of the image. Clearly this means that the distance between 2 pixels at the furtherest away parts of the image is greater than the distance between the closer pixels which are magnified in a sense. If I could manage something that works reasonably well for even just 40 degrees from vertical, that would be great.p  pMy first attempt was to get the size of the surface that is in view, then use that to scale my coordinates. However, I do not believe this worked. x2,y2 may not be in the centre of the captured surface and also there is some kind of offset  that needs to be added to the coordinates since the captured surface is not directly below.p  pI hope that was all clear. If you need more information please let me know. Im just going around in circles a bit.p  pThanksp
Negative 1874 pIve wanted to write my own portable IDE for CLisp for a while now and have recently started with it, using C. p  pI have implemented bracket highlighting by checking if the current character is a bracket and then moving backwardsforwards throughout the text, whilst keeping track of the following openingclosing brackets until the number of opening and closing brackets are equal.p  pI have done this using simple for loops also breaking the for loop as soon as the matching bracket is found, but the method is slow on larger blocks of code. The method of highlighting text in the RichTextBox also seems a bit inefficient, i.e. selecting the characters by programmatically moving the cursor and applying a highlight, then deselecting and moving back to the cursors original position. Moving away from the brackets requires the highlighting to be cleared, so I simply select all the text and then remove the formatting on it. p  pOccasionally the application cant keep track of where the cursor is supposed to be if the user moves the cursor too fast using the arrow keys on the keyboard and the application might erroneously move it back to a previous position. Simply put, the highlighting function I wrote cant keep up if the user scrolls through large blocks of code using the keyboard. p  pIs there a more efficient way of going about this other than for loops Am I simply using inefficient methods to highlight and unhighlight the brackets Could Regex offer a solution herep  pWhile I wrote my piece of code myself, in essence I have done exactly what Bill The Lizard has done here a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions12752225howdoifindthepositionofmatchingparenthesesorbracesinagivenpieceofHow do I find the position of matching parentheses or braces in a given piece of textap

Negative 1874 pI am trying to develop a utility that will allow customization of strings after our product is deployed. Satellite assemblies seem to be a good way to go here. I have plenty of experience with using codeMicrosoft.VisualBasic.VBCodeProvidercode and codeMicrosoft.CSharp.CSharpCodeProvidercode as part of a process where code can be compiled and loaded at runtime. However, satellite assemblies dont seem to involve a full compile process. As I look around the web for information on building satellite assemblies, it seems that you need to skip the code compiling step and just use the link step codeAL.execode to link a compiled code.resourcescode file into a satellite DLL.p  pIve gotten as far as generating the compiled code.resourcescode files using codeSystem.Resources.ResourceWritercode, but Im now looking for an elegant way to invoke the functionality in codeAL.execode that will create a DLL from that. Sure I could simply invoke codeSystem.Diagnostics.Process.Startcode on codeAL.EXEcode, but that doesnt seem very elegant seeing as how .NET framework has builtin classes for building code.resourcescode files and for compiling VB.NET and C source code.p  pAt the very least I need a good way to get the path to an appropriate codeAL.EXEcode executable, but preferably there would simply be a .NET class that can accomplish the linking.p

This representation of strongGstrong, requires at the worst case strongX2X2strong weight values and exactly strongX2X2strong edge objects, plus the balance information and the parentchilds pointers to maintain the tree, which is memory space consuming.p  pSo my question is how to efficiently represent these strongmstrong edge lists and list them in the decreasing order of their weights.p

Negative 1874 pI am supposed to create a log analysis software for my Master Degree thesis.  Currently I am in the data collection phase  so I need a way to read a file in real time. For example I have to monitor the varlogauth.log file and to look for failed logins just an example among the 1000000s to come for my program . So I need to read the file line by line. OK, if I were to use a scripting language Python, Ruby this would be really easy, but since I am in JAVA, I wasnt very lucky. Anybody gotta clue how to read a file in Real Time, maybe an example Thanks in advance.p

However, I found that many of these functions will error out for strange reasons, some known and some unknown. I designed the below function to at least let me see the error message before throwing a giant traceback at me. I have the below command in one libraryp  precodeFooBar  tracechecklambda Foobar codepre  pThis is the error catching function in a separate libraryp  precodedef tracecheckfunc     try         return func     except         TracebackString  traceback.formatexc This gets the traceback as a string.         type, message, tracebacklocation  sys.excinfo This gets the components, particularly the message.         print An error has occurred with the following error message         print type    Example is IOError         print message     The message associated with the error         TracebackPrompt  askDo you want to see the entire traceback Returns TrueFalse value         if TracebackPrompt             print TracebackString         print Exiting Python Script This shows me it gets to this point.         sys.exit0  This is the problem         print Did it work    This statement does not print, so exit worked... codepre  pWhen tracecheck runs and I get an error, the sys.exit only quits the function back out to main instead of ending main. if I use os.exit instead, the main function ends correctly, but the program running the script also dies. One command is not strong enough and the other is overkill... what could I do instead to ensure the main function endsp  pNote I tried putting the meat of my tracecheck function into the first library, but the same thing happens with the library call ending but not the main.p  ptldr  Python main calls function in library that calls a second function in separate library. Second function has a sys.exit command that only exits to main instead of ending main. os.exit kills shell and is overkill requires restarting shell TTTT. Is there another way to end the main from a function libraryp

The only static attribute that I see is the productid, which is unlikely to change. And if a new productid is added I can just add it to the enum without having to change any indices and such.  p  pMy question then becomes how can I click on the element based on the productid I know how to get the attribute, but of course that returns a string but somehow I want to click on the item based on the productid.

Negative 1874 pWe have a small office with 20 computers that are about 8020 split Macs vs. PCs.  I am a web developer by trade who manages our little network but am, by no means, a networkingDNS expert.p  pThat being said, we are having trouble in that every single web site we visit stackoverflow.com included that makes a call to a Google API takes emforeverem to load.  They all get stuck with a statusbar message such as Connecting to fonts.googleapis.com, ajax.googleapis.com, developers.google.com etc...  Eventually, the api call times out and the site will then load without it.  Sometimes we get a popup error accounts.google.com failed to respond.  In fact, when we finally get Stack Overflow to load this message is at the top of the page Stack Overflow requires external JavaScript from another domain, which is blocked or failed to load.p  pThis seems to be only happening on our internal network.  For instance, we can connect laptops, phones and tablets to LTEmobile networks and they load up the same sites fine.p  pOddly enough, Google.com, itself, loads fine.  As do Gmail and Google Docs.p  pWhen I ping fonts.googleapis.com from both inside the network and from our firewall I get Request timed out for googleapis.l.google.com [74.125.70.95].p  pI have tried deleting all Google entries from our DNS server, an old Windows 2003 Small Biz Server, which sometimes results in googleapis.l.google.com getting a different IP address from our ISP which alleviates the issue temporarily.  But, it seems eventually this same IP of 74.125.70.95 will get tacked on to the API URL and were back in the same boat.p  pI tried changing the DNS server address of our Win2003 SBS server, itself, away from our ISPs address to both OpenDNS and Googles own DNS server but this hasnt helped.p  pThis has been happening for about a month.p  pAny ideasp

Negative 1874 pGiven an arbitrary function codefunccode with arbitrary argument types and number I would like to get a function that returns a unit  codefunccodewith the return value ignored. Think of it as projection onto purely sideeffecting functions. If codefunccode takes one argument or if it is in an uncurried form it is just codefuncgtgtignorecode. The obvious solution is to write a generic operator for every number of arguments of codefunccode that we needp  precodelet inline unitise1 f a  f a gt ignore let inline unitise2 f a b  f a b gt ignore let inline unitise3 f a b c  f a b c gt ignore let inline unitise4 f a b c d  f a b c d gt ignore codepre  petc. Thats messy and inconvenient because we need to count the arguments every time, and the code will not refactor well. Is there a language construct that Im missing that would allow to do this cleanerp  pEDIT I believe such an operator would be useful because the codeNETcode generics are weaker than codeFcode statically resolved type parameters. Heres what I mean. Suppose I have a higher order functionp  precodelet inline higher f g      f 7 gt ignore     g 3 gt ignore codepre  pWe can pass to it any function whatsoever provided its first argument is an codeintcode. So this will workp  precodelet add n  n1 let str nint  n.ToString higher add str higher str add  codepre  pIn particular, no generic type annotations are needed. This is what we know and love about F. Now, I have a situation were I need to pass a lot 15 of functions as arguments for codehighercode. They will will be passed down the call chain multiple times. It is natural to group them in a data structure.p  precodetype FuncsltR1,R2,R3gt  f1intgtR1f2intgtR2f3intgtR3 codepre  pThis gets ugly well before you reach 15 generic parameters. Not type annotating was possible only when functions were concerned. If I could unitise functions Id change codehighercode top  precodelet inline higher f g      f 7     g 3 codepre  pand would use a helper function that unitises every function before building codeFuncscode from them. In this toy example codefcode and codegcode both have one argument so the solution is easy, but in the real case different functions have different numbers of arguments.p  pSince writing this questions Ive gritted my teeth though and wrote a behemoth of codeFuncscode with 15 generic parameters.p

Easy to read and made it quick to solve the problem.p  pNow Im testing out Azure Websites to run asp.net applications and im racking my brain trying to figure out how to have the same kind of quick error find a fix process.p  pViewing the application logging in Azures application diagnostics is utterly useless. It would take me forever to dig through those logs. rewriting the application to handle errors differently is not an option for me. p  pSo who else is having this problem any solutions p

Negative 1874 pOkay, so right now Ive got a working weight checker program. The programs current version is currently used in the factory floor.The program has been tested considerably as is now stable at ver 2.3. Ive been asked to add a new feature to the program. This isnt the problem as Ive added features to the program before, and Ive got a clear idea on what to do.p  pThe issue now, is that the program now requires some serious refactoring. The program is a desktop application, divided into several tabs and uses controls like datagridview and serial port. The majority of the program is written inside the frmMain.cs form file. This includes formcontrol events, variables and methods. The methods are grouped in a region according to their related functionalityfunctions used in the same tab etc, although as the program grows, new methods are placed more or less where they are most relevant at. The whole file is a nightmarish 5000 lines of code.p  pIm thinking of refactoring it so that all the methods wont be inside frmMain. Ive got some clear ideas on which one should have its own class  serial port for example  but for the most of them, theyre quite tied to the forms and control events separating them into another class is going to take a lot of whiles. Also, I have no good idea of which design pattern I am supposed to adapt. p  pNot all the codes are inside the frmMain. Ive got a custom MsgBox class, another class for handling global variables and text processing, and other forms that are separate from the main program. I want to make the program more readable and systematic so that the guy after me  or me after six months  wont take a single look at the program and go WTF.p  pIve read about partial classes and is kinda tempted to go down that path, although Ive also read that its not a good idea. p  pDoes anyone has any good idea on how to approach this issuep

Negative 1874 pI have MySQL cluster NDB containing 2 servers[NodeA and NodeB]. I have another machine having InnoDB[NodeC] outside cluster. NodeA is master for NodeC replication slave. Problem arises when NodeA is down in cluster, and some transaction take place at NodeB of the cluster. When NodeA is again up and running, all data is sync between NodeA and NodeB. [I set sqlslaveskipcounter1 into NodeC to remove LOSTEVENT error.] But the data is not replicated to NodeC. If after that any transaction takes place data is replicated but the data that is u[dated during downtime of NodeA is not replicated to NodeC.p  pAm I missing some setting so that Slave starts replicating from the point is left after Master is up again and in sync with other cluster nodesp

Probably worth metioning Im using the a hrefhttpsgithub.comprawnsaladNexmoPHPlib relnofollowprawnsaladNexmoPHPlib librarya to connect with their API.p  pA simple text messages of 160 characters is divided into 3 separate messages. According to the Nexmo support, this is caused by the encoding of the message. So to provide me with some more information I recevied the follow information about the encodingp  blockquote   pThe maximum number of characters per message depends on the encoding     160 characters for 7bit encoding e.g. Latin19 and GSM8     140 characters for 8bit encoding Binary     70 characters for 16bit encoding Unicode p      pThe maximum number of characters per concatenated message depends on   the encoding     153 characters for 7bit encoding e.g. Latin19 and GSM8     134 characters for 8bit encoding Binary     67 characters for 16bit encoding Unicodep blockquote  pWhen I use the 7BIT encoding emmbconvertencodingmessage, 7bitem the entire message goes out as a single text message... BUT characters like , , ,  are removed from the message. There must be a way to include this charachters and still send out the message as 1 message and not 3.. right But howp  pI really hope that someone here can help with this issue, even the support of Nexmo took a step back from this encoding issue pp

Negative 1874 pIm looking for a 2D HTML5 canvas library which allows me to specify coordinates likep  precodeX 5  5px Y 50  20px codepre  pOf course that doesnt mean they should support that specific notation, as long as they allow for the same logic. For instancep  precode   xPercent 5,   xFixed 5,   yPercent 50,   yFixed 20  codepre  pWould be fine.p  pThere are quite a few nice HTML5 canvas libraries out there, which allow for DOMlike manipulation of entities circles, rectangles, images, etc inside the canvas, animations and interactivity. So far I looked at a hrefhttppaperjs.org relnofollowPaper.jsa, a hrefhttpfabricjs.com relnofollowFabric.jsa and a hrefhttpwww.createjs.comEaselJS relnofollowEaselJSa.p  pstrongThe problem isstrong p  pAs far as I know, these dont allow for coordinates to be specified in both percentage and fixed unit format strongat the same time, as in the example abovestrong.p  pUp to this point, I havent found any canvas library which supports this. My next step would be to implement a wrapper over an existing 2D canvas library.

Negative 1874 pFor instance I am writing an article in english about revision control that I would like to translate to several other languages.

Negative 1874 pIm new on Google Datasore and Python but I have a project on it. Even with the great Google documentation I miss a realworld example of modeling data.

For the cards, we have theses informations  the color, the period it occurred, a player id, the reason, the time it occurred.  For the Goals, we have the period, a player id, the time, a player assistant id.p  pWe have also the detail for each team of  the player name, their position center, middle, and date of birth.p  pHere the model I would like to use to ingest data from the soccer feed into the Datastore using python  p  pI have some entities  Team, Player, Match, TeamData, Card and Goal.

Negative 1874 pIm sure this has been asked before, but all the questions I can find are far too complex. Really simply, how do I align a div container to the center and middle of a page both horizontally and vertically, so that it also stays there when the page is resized as well. p  pAll I need is a blank browser window with a div that stays in the center of the screen when the window is resized, no matter what. Horizontal align is quite easy using codemarginautocode but its the vertical align that seems to be troublesome.p  pA lot of solutions require that there first be a set height that the div is floating in.

Is there a way to do this without changing the model Because if I have to change it in the Model designer I have to do that everytime I delete the table from the model and readd it.p

Negative 1874 pSo I faced the problem when doing memory integrity checks mostlikely done with CRC32 because of its speed on modules which have ASLR enabled the result is different on each restart due to the changed bytes for calls, long jumps and so on. I tried everything but I couldnt find a real solution to generate the same hash result for those files in memory. Im only checking the .text section of the files for now, and it works very well on files which have a static base address. Hope anyone can help me to find those dynamic bytes so I can either ignore them or relocate them anyhow. Thanks in advancep  pEdit The code is written in C if this helps anythingp

Negative 1874 pI have a stacked column chart that is displaying data grouped by one category and using a single series group.  The series group is then sorted by another column in my result set.  The sorting works great when the series data doesnt change, no new rows, between category groups.  However, if the records and the ordering change between groups, the individual groupings are not treated uniquely when applying the sort.  Instead, additions to the series group are appended to the group data.p  pTo better explain the issue Ill provide a basic illustration using a stock market example, which closely resembles my data.  So, lets say I am tracking and charting a couple of dozen stock picks by hour, and Im only interesting in reporting on the hourly average price of each stock.  Additionally Im really only interested in seeing a stock if their price falls within a specific range.  So the report runs my query, and on this particular day the results are not reporting all stocks that Im querying for several hours, because some of them are not falling within my set price range.  However, later in the day, some of the prices come back within the range and the number of stocks returned for those hours are higher than earlier in the day.  This data is displayed the same as above, using a bar chart with a category group by hour, and a series group by stock price.  The series group is sorted by some other arbitrary data value in my result set, for the sake of the example well say its the number of shared owned.  So, when those new stocks are added to the bar chart, they are not in the desired order as if each hour group were being sorted independently.  Instead they appear to just be appended to the hour as if they werent considered in the sort.p  pI hope that Ive explained this well, but let me know if I need to provide further clarification.  Id like to determine if I am doing something wrong or discover that this is a limitation of SSRS sorting on series groups using dynamic data sets.  All help is much appreciated.p

Negative 1874 pI am trying to integrate Hot TowelAngular with the SPA Template. The one issue that Im having is retrieving the accesstoken from a redirect to the AuthorizeEndPointPath. In Fiddler, I can see the accesstoken being returned in the Location header of the response for the 302 status redirect but there doesnt appear to be a way to capture that in Angular. All that I can get from the call is the 200 status from the redirected page.p  pLooking at the OOB SPA template provided that uses knockout, I havent figured out how the windows.location.hash property is used to extract the accesstoken. Modifying the same code in angular has led to a complete dead end. Have also tried using a response interceptor with no luck as others have tried the same approach.p  pOthers here have posted about this same approach and look to have come to the same conclusion. If the MSDN documentation wasnt complete rubbish, maybe someone could figure it out. Really wish MSDN documentation didnt totally suck. MS really should hire better technical writers.p  pStarted to think the only workaround is to store username and password in session storage and if login is successful, use the token endpoint to get the token as that works fine.

Negative 1874 pI have the functionality where my API sends out many types of messages, say, text image video audio and rich media contents.

But the real problem with this approach is, one provider provides new type of message whereas the old providers does not, so they need to implement the new method and throw codeUnsupportedOperationExceptioncode. So I refactored it like the one below,p  precodeinterface Response      void sendMessageResponseMessage message   abstract class ResponseMessage      ...  public class PlainTextResponse extends ResponseMessage     private String messagemessage    public PlainTextResponseString message        this.messagemessage      codepre  pNow the client sends the message like,p  precodepublic static void mainString... str      Response resp  ...     resp.sendMessagenew PlainTextMessageHello World  codepre  pNow implementing a Response interfacep  precodeclass ResponseProvider1Impl implement Response      public ResponseProvider1ImplResponseProcessor processor        this.processorprocessor          void sendMessageResponseMessage message            how do I get rid of this if block          ifmessage instanceof PlainTextMessage               processor.sendTextMessagemessage.getData           else ifmessage instanceof PictureMessage                processor.sendPictureMessagemessage.getData                   ......       codepre  pI thought the ResponseProcessor would keep many things out from the actual Response interfacep  precodeinterface ResponseProcessor       void sendTextMessageString message      void sendPictureMessagebyte[] image      .....      void sendRichMediaMessageRichMedia message  codepre  pThings were going good till I got here,p  precodeclass ResponseProcessorProvider1Impl implements ResponseProcessor        void sendTextMessageString message do things to send a text message      void sendPictureMessagebyte[] image      .....      void sendRichMediaMessageRichMedia message  codepre  pNow the strongquestionstrong How do I get rid of the if blocks that checks and invokes methods based on its type Yeah, I hear someone saying, move this to a factory with reflection or enum to not use switch or if statements, okay, but is that the right way for this Do you see a better way to design this any other design patterns I may apply for thisp

And it works as expected on safari, google chrome, and opera. But on firefox and internet explorer browsers i see picture number 1. Where cards are scaled enormously.

Negative 1874 pWin7 Directx 11 with VS 2012  When I let my app run in full screen on my development computer, eventually, the program exits full screen back to windowed, all by itself, and pops up a dialog telling me windows resources are running low. The dialog tells me something about turning off interactive themes or something to that end. When I run the program in release mode on one of our client machines, the app runs fine, does everything it should, but after a while, instead of popping up the dialog about windows resources, I get an exception window with exception 0x40000015 as the error. This only happens if I am in full screen, windowed, it never crashes. Event Viewer shows nothing at all about the crash. Any thoughtsp  pThanks in advance. Basically what my app is, is a wrapper graphics library. When it says I am using all the resources, my resource monitor shows that I never went above 20 of memory and the cpu never went above 14. The 0x40000015 error number is rather general and doesnt exactly point me in any real direction.p  pThis is not related to trying to exit an app in full screen, as that I have the code required to prevent the exception related to that problem.p  pRp

Negative 1874 pIm trying to create a dictionary which has a collection for every key. The reason for this is that I want to retrieve several values from the same key later on. In this example I want to have the total value val of a unique key as well as the number of occurrences np  precodesub update Dim dict As Dictionary Dim coll As Collection Set dict  New Dictionary Set coll  New Collection  coll.Add 100, val coll.Add 3, n dict.Add coll, coll  Debug.Print dict.itemcollval Debug.Print dict.itemcolln codepre  pThis works fine so far, the problem occurs when I try to update the value in the collection object doesnt support thisp  precodedict.itemcollval  dict.itemcollval  100 codepre  pWhat I triedp  blockquote   pIf I use an array instead of the collection, there is no error but the value doesnt change.   It only works if I read out the collection to variables, change the value, create a new collection, remove the old from the dictionary and add the new collection.p blockquote  pIs there any way to do it like my approach above in a single line  I would also be happy for an alternative solution to the task.p
Negative 1874 pSo I have a controller to load all the tasks for example p  precode scope.tasks  taskService.all  scope.tasks.loaded.thenfunctiondata         console.log data      Destroy all the AngularFire connection   scope.ondestroy, function         scope.tasks.destroy      codepre  pThe taskService is as below p  precode    var ref  new FirebaseFirebaseUrl     var tasks  firebaseArrayref.childtasks     var uid  Users.LoginUserId      var Task            all tasks,          getAllTasks function              console.log Run get All tasks.             return firebaseArrayref.childtasks         ,     ... ...     ... codepre  pUse scope.tasks  taskService.all I think I am getting a tasks array  which is ONE firebaseArray. When I logout using Auth.unauth, there is no permission errors. When I log back in and go to the same view, scope.tasks is a empty array  []. I dont know why the taskService dont go get the tasks firebaseArray again. It will only go get the firebase array when I force refresh the browser. p  pIf I use p  precodescope.tasks  taskService.getAllTasks codepre  pin the taskService  a method  function to return firebaseArray. This tasks will not be empty array after I logout and log back in. But I can tell when I logout, there are many permission errors  look like there are many firebaseArrays each time I come to this view waste of resources since there are multiple same copy of tasks arrayp  pSo which is the right way to handle it Why using a method in servicesfactory will produce multiple duplicated firebaseAarray when I navigate around my app and back to the same views Is that really bad And why using a factory.value way will cause issue when logout and log back in I can not find any clear explanation about this. Firebase expert please help.  p  pstrongEDIT FOR FINIAL SOLUTIONstrong   p  pThanks to nicolas here is my finial solution  The code provided by nicolas cant work on my solution since this.tasks  [] will still be true. It is not NULL. It is just an empty array. So I have to do this instead p  precodegetAllTasks function               if tasks.length  0                  console.log Logout and Log back in. Tasks is empty                 tasks  firebaseArrayref.childtasks              else                  console.log Navigate around. Tasks is NOT empty                 tasks  tasks                          return tasks         , codepre  ptasks is already inside a factory and it is private. I dont think I need to use . p

Negative 1874 pIm writing a compiler in a functional style. The type checker is currently fairly straightforward its mostly just a function from codeExprcode to codeTypecode.p  pNow, I want to add a step to the workflow that preserves the type information for later stages. There are a number of ways to do this symbol tables, etc., but a simple one is to translate into an IR that looks like the AST but contains type information. For example, if the AST data type isp  precodedatatype Expr  Literal of int                Add of Expr  Expr                ... codepre  pThen the typed IR would bep  precodetype TExpr  Type  TExpr datatype TExpr  TLiteral of int                  TAdd of TExpr  TExpr                  ... codepre  pSo my goal now is to convert my type checker into a type annotator a function codeExpr gt TExprcode instead of codeExpr gt Typecode. Heres my question emHow would you do this without adding a bunch of boilerplate clutter to the type checker functionemp  pNaively, I would need to add wrapping and unwrapping code all over the place, ruining the simple legibility of the type checker function as it stands. That is, the case for codeAddcode in the type checker currently looks likep  precodelet lhst  check lhs in let rhst  check rhs in case lhst, rhst of   Int, Int gt Int  ,  gt Error codepre  pNice and clean Exactly matches the typing judgment in the formalism p  pIf I mucked up the type checker with the additional translation logic, it would look like this now codecheckcode has type codeExpr gt TExprcodep  precode Recursive calls to translate the children.  let lhstyped  check lhs in let rhstyped  check rhs in  We dont care about the expression for checking, just the resulting   type. So extract that from each child.  let lhst,   lhstyped in let rhst,   rhstyped in case Int, Int gt    Construct a TExpr with the new type.    Int, TAdd lhstyped, rhstyped  ,  gt Error codepre  pThis has unpleasantly intermingled the interesting type checking logic with the boring boilerplate for destructing and constructing codeTExprcode. p  pIs there any way to separate these components That is, can the type checking logic live in one recursive function while the translation machinery acts as an external client of it Bonus points if its still easy to run the type checker emwithoutem doing translation if you want to.p  hr  pBonus context this follows the Separate IR option from a hrefhttpblog.ezyang.com201305theasttypingproblem relnofollowEdward Z.

I.e. it does not load all the values from the table and just stops working. When this line is removed from the code, the code is processed OK hence all 4 SQL queries are performed and entire page is executed currently displaying only two empty graphs. However if I leave that code there and I print for example row[0] in each iteration of fetchrow, I can see that it loads fully the first table, but only partially the second table, and then it hangs.p  pWhat am I doing wrongp
