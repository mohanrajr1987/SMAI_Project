Positive 8403 pI have a compass object which rotates and moves along with the camera. Thus the rotation and position of the compass object is adjusted along with the playercontrolled camera. Now, having attached a needle to my compass  I would like to have the needle point north.p  pThat is easily done but having the needle point to a northern object. But the needle now doesnt follow the plate compass object it is placed on. I would thus like the needle to point accordingly. In other word, rotate singly along the yaxis. p  pI dont need code  I just need a broad idea of how to do that. I would really appreciate any help p

Positive 8403 pI have a basic car model and a wind sound. The wind has been made so it gets louder as the car speeds up, but also louder as the door opens wider. It works all fine on the left door, but screws up on the right door. I think its something to do with the rotation of the right door, at first it will be at about 90 before moving, but then as the door opens, it goes past 360 and then back to 0, where it continues rotating. This is what I think is messing it up, but I dont know.

Positive 8403 pIve added four StackPanes, each with a Rectangle and a Label on them, to the sides of a BorderPane. I want the Labels on the right and left sides to be rotated 90 and 90 degrees, respectively. When I apply such rotations to either the whole StackPanes or just the Labels on them, the rotation apparently does nothing to change the underlying height and width of the nodes, and thus my alignment is off. Is there an easy fix to thisp  pEDIT Since I cant post a screenshot here, what Im seeing is that the 400x400 pane is stretched to fit the width of the two rectangles that is, their width before rotation.

Positive 8403 pI have a very basic script to move the camera from the mouse position, but I want to constrain the rotation of the z axis to some values. With the code below it all works fine, but the camera can be rotated fully on the z axis, I want to limit it to 20 and 40. I have tried to use mathf.clamp but that didnt work and when printed to the console it only printed out the right most value in the mathf.clamp. I also tried using an if statement to see if the rotation was over the limit, and then to reset it if it was. But neither worked...

I want it to be smooth nicely looking motion. I tried some things, some of them seem to be working a little, but thats still not smooth and not flexible.

Positive 8403 pIm currently facing some problems in reading out the values of the Android rotation vector.

Positive 8403 pIm stuck on a problem where were given the starting position P0 and length L0 of one line segment and the starting position P1 and length L1 of another line segment, and we return the configurations where both segments end at the same point. Im coding a function in C that returns one valid configuration for such inputs, or indicates that no configuration is valid. Below are the files that I made, which utilize the Eigen C libraries.p  pSegmentConfigurations.cppp  precode  SegmentConfigurations.cpp  Defines a utility function that calculates the    orientation for two input line segments such that they share a common    endpoint, and the other endpoints are specified as inputs.    Details on the implementation are described in the writeup document.     include RotationMatrix.h include SegmentConfigurations.h using namespace std using namespace Eigen   calculate the square of the number x define squarex xx  calculate the magnitude of the vector with coordinates x,y,z define magnitudex,y,z sqrtxx  yy  zz   Returns a configuration such that the two input line segments share   a common point see previous explanation.     Parameters   p0, p1 Two input points.   l0 The length of the line segment that includes p0 as one endpoint.   l1 The length of the line segment that includes p1 as one endpoint.       Function assumes l0 and l1 are both nonnegative.     Output   An Orientation structure containing two nonnull 3x3 rotation matrices   specifying the orientations for the line segments, or NULL if there is   no configuration that allows the two line segments to share an endpoint.   struct Orientations segmentconfigurationsVector3d p0, double l0,                                             Vector3d p1, double l1       vector pointing in the

The hope is that the displacement factor of this matrix added to P0 would result in P1, but that isnt always the case because M3 isnt correct, or at least I think. Im not sure if part of my function is wrong, or if Im testing it wrong, and this is the main part of where Im stuck. Any help is welcomed.p

Positive 8403 pIm using threeVR to make a 360 panorama. It uses mobile device orientation to rotate the camera inside a sphere and also allows the user to manually drag the sphere on touch.p  pHowever, when user releases the touch, camera jumps back to device rotation.

Positive 8403 pi have just started to study three.js and i am having some trouble to write a function that takes as arguments an object position Vector3 and a time in milliseconds, and gradually rotate the camera to face it in that time. Substantially a lerp version of the builtin lookAt method.p  pFirst ive tried using tweenjs to get smooth rotate transition. For the start and end parameters ive created a dummy object and set its position, rotation and quaternion the same as the camera, then i have use the lookAt function on it to face towards the object and ive stored its quaternion in a new variable targetQuaternion.

Positive 8403 pim using Sygic SDK in my form .net WinForms with Gmap.NET to display the map. I have implemented map rotation based on GPS coordinates from Sygic. To rotate the map I create 23 vectors from last coordinates, add them and get the angle. The problem arise when u stand on one place, the coordinates are not the same due to GPS range error so the map starts randomly rotating. p  pI could have fixed that if i had that error value, but i only found HDoP horizontal dilution of precision in Sygic documentation and its only the scalar to multiply error. So if coordinates are in error range i dont rotate the map.p  pIs there any trick to computer error value Is there different implementationp  pSygic also provides speed within coordinates struct. Should i try to use Speed instead So do not rotate the map if speed is 0.

Negative 8403 pI have an application thats going to use Active Directory for Authentication. This will be used in mnay locaitons, so I want the user to be able to input their AD domain into a settings file. So, the first time they run this app, they wont be able to login, because they havent entered the AD Domain name, so want I want to do, is check the web.config to see if there is an ADName value in there, if there isnt, forward them to the settings page, if there is, then they should be asked to authenticate and then forwarded to the index page. Is this possiblep  pIn particualr what I need to know, is the best way to make it so the settings page does not require authetnication if the ADName value is empty, but does if it is not.p

Negative 8403 pI am not an infopath developer and this is my first real encounter with XSLT.

Once in html we can use any thirdparty library to spit out any desiredsupported format we want.p  pWhat We Do In Codep  ol liWe create an XslCompiledTransform object. This is done by parsing the Xsn uploaded to sharepoint and then using the Xsl in there. We use View1.xsl. No issues happen here.li liThe Xml form is returned as a stream to our conversion method where we create an XmlDocument that the transform needs to be applied to using a stream.li liWe then pass the XmlDocument to the transform method along with an XmlTextWriter object which populates an StringWriter object for us. We can then use the StringWriter to give us the html as a string or stream and pass it to the thirdparty library to change to any format like PDFMHT etc...li ol  pThe Problem That Occurs After Transformation p  ol liI lose DateFormatting.

Unfortunately, in my use case, this value is often null, as there is a strongpublic Filterstrong noarg constructor as well. This means I cant do a selectedOption.getClass without getting an NPE.  This filter class manages a list of available options which of the options is selected. When nothing is selected, selectedOption is null.p  pThe only thing I can think to solve this is to actually pass in a Class in the constructor.  So something like thisp  precodeclass FilterltT extends EnumltTgtgt      private ListltTgt availableOptions  new ArrayListltTgt     private T selectedOption      public FilterClassltTgt clazz          thisclazz,null           public FilterClassltTgt clazz, T selectedOption          this.selectedOption  selectedOption         for T option  clazz.getEnumConstants              availableOptions.addoption                codepre  pAny ideas how to do this without needing an extra Class parameter in the constructorsp

Negative 8403 pIs it possible, using the gecko  firefox XPCOM interfaces, to delete or invalidate a users active session without closing the browser I am using Gecko embedded specifically a hrefhttpgeckofx.org relnofollowGeckoFXa in an application where it is possible that multiple users might use the browser component across the lifetime of the application.p  pThe application packages web browsing with various other functionality, and when the web browser is closed, the app remains open. It seems that as far as the gecko engine is concerned, as the process hasnt closed, the active session is still active. If a user is to log into Gmail or Facebook, for instance, and then close the browser, upon reopening the browser and navigating back to one of those pages, that user is determined to still be logged in. As multiple users can use the application without the application actually exiting, this raises privacy issues.p  pI have tried calling a hrefhttpsdeveloper.mozilla.orgenNSInitXPCOM2 relnofollowNSInitXPCOM2a and a hrefhttpsdeveloper.mozilla.orgenNSShutdownXPCOM relnofollowNSShutdownXPCOMa within the constructor  dispose method of the browser control, however NSInitXPCOM2 cannot be called after NSShutdownXPCOM within the lifetime of the process, so this simply crashes.p  pI have also used the PurgeHistory method of a hrefhttpwww.oxymoronical.comexperimentsapidocsinterfacensISHistorycfCB1B3E5C1813FD1AENjUwOTA6YWN0aXZlZGlyZWN0b3J5OtAJSzQYvClnZXqn7vZuafk relnofollownsISHistorya and the evictEntries method of a hrefhttpsdeveloper.mozilla.orgenXPCOMInterfaceReferencensICacheService relnofollownsICacheServicea  none of these appear to have an immediate effect within the life of the process.p  pDoes anyone know of any XPCOM interfaces that can achieve this Alternatively, any pointers in direction of similar functionality, be it through XPCOM interfaces or Firefox extensions would be greatly appreciated are there any extensions that allow you to clear your current browsing session without reopening the browser or that provide you a different session between each Firefox window  tabp  pThe program is written in C, however answers in any language are appreciated.p  pMany thanksp

Negative 8403 pI am moving to C from Java and I am having a lot of trouble understanding the basics of how C classes work and best practices for designing them. Specifically I am wondering if I should be using a pointer to my class member in the following case.p  pI have a custom class Foo which which represents the state of a game on a specific turn, and Foo has a member variable of custom class Bar which represents a logical subset of that game state. For example Foo represents a chess board and Bar represents pieces under attack and their escape moves not my specific case, but a more universal analogy I think.p  pI would like to search a sequence of moves by copying Foo and updating the state of the copy accordingly. When I am finished searching that move sequence I will discard that copy and still have my original Foo representing the current game state.p  pIn Foo.h I declare my Foo class and I declare a member variable for it of type Barp  precodeclass Foo      Bar b public     Foo     Fooconst Fooamp f  codepre  pBut in the implementation of my Foo constructors I am calling the Bar constructor with some arguments specific to the current state which I will know at run time. As far as I understand, this means that a Bar constructor is called twice  once because I wrote Bar b above which calls the default constructor if I understand correctly, and once because I am writing something like b  Bararg1,arg2,... in FooFoo and FooFooconst Fooamp f.p  pIf I am trying to make as many copies of Foo per second as possible, this is a problem, rightp  pI am thinking a simple solution is to declare a pointer to a Bar instead Bar b, which should avoid instantiating b twice. Is this good practice Does this present any pitfalls I should know about Is there a better solution I cant find a specific example to help me besides lots of warnings against using pointers, and all the information about designing classes is really overwhelming, so any guidance would be greatly appreciatedp  pstrongEDITstrong Yes, I will have all the information necessary to create Bar when I create my Foo. I think everyone inferred this, but to make it clear, I have something more like this already for my default constructorp  precodeFooint k5 codepre  pand in Foo.cppp  precodeFooFooint k      b  Bark     ...  codepre  pand then my Foo and its Bar member are updated incrementally as the game state changes.p  pSo calling my custom Bar constructor in my Foo constructor strikedeclarationstrike eminitialization listem looks like the best way to do it.

However, all the examples Ive seen in my searches pertain to inserting data into one table.  p  pQuestions 1.  Given a typical order process  customer information, order information, order details  should a wizard control be used to insert data into multiple database tables  If not, what controlsworkflow do you suggest 2.  Ive set primary keys and indexes on my order details, orders and customers tables.  Is there special stored procedure syntax to use to ensure that referential integrity is maintained through the insert processp  pThanks, Sidp

Negative 8403 pI have requirement where I need to allow users to upload a Word document with place holders for certain fields which can be found in the database. This will be their template. For example the place holders might be prepended with  or something. For examplep  precodeDear Title Lastname codepre  pThey then can grab a record and hit export to Word document. This will then let them choose the template. They can select the template and then click continue. I will then get the template and replace the codeTitlecode with the title field in the database for the selected record. I am not sure where to start or what components I need to do this. p  pFrom my initial investigation it seems that I can do this with the new open XML standard for Office 2007. So perhaps I should read in the template and save all the contents to a db table somewhere. Then when the use wants to export I get the contents again and then do a search and replace for the codecode placeholders and link them properly. Then save the document to the output stream again which will then bring up the save dialog on their browser.p  pI am using ASP.Net MVC and am in a hosted environment. I was also maybe contemplating dynamically creating a new View type and dynamically creating new views when the user uploads a template. Not sure that this approach will work though.p  pIs this a good approach What tools should I be looking at Any other suggestionsp

Negative 8403 pSorry, I am pretty much an SQL noob. This has to work in MSFT SQL, Oracle as well as Sybase. In the following snippet I need to change an codeinner joincode between codeIJcode and codeKLcode on codeIJ.POid  KL.POidcode into a codeleft joincode also on codeIJ.POid  KL.POidcode. So, I believe I have to refactor this. Well, implicit joins are not the most readable, at least in my coworkers eyes. I guess I will agree until I develop my own taste. Sorry, I mangled the table and field names just in case.p  precode IJid is an input stored proc patrameter.  from AB,       CD,      EF,      GH,      IJ,      KL where     EF.EFid  IJ.EFid and     IJ.EFid  AB.EFid and     EF.ZYid  IJ.ZYid and     IJ.ZYid  AB.ZYid and     IJ.IJid  AB.IJid and     IJ.IJid  IJid and     EF.XWid  GH.GHid and     AB.VUcode  CD.VUcode and     IJ.TS gt 0 and     IJ.RQ  0 and     EF.RQ  0 and     AB.RQ  0 and     IJ.POid  KL.POid codepre  pNow, my difficulty is that there is a lot going on in the where clause. Things that do not look like codea.b  c.dcode will remain in the where clause, but not all stuff that does look like codea.b  c.dcode look easy to convert into an explicit join. The difficult part is that ideally the conditions would be between neighbors  codeABCDcode, codeCDEFcode, codeEFGHcode, codeGHIJcode, codeIJKLcode but they are not that organized right now. I could reorder some, but ultimately I do not want to forget my goal I want the new query to be no slower, and I want the new query to be no less readable. It seems that I might be better off hacking just the part that I need to change, and leave it mostly the same. I am not sure if I can do that.p  pIf you understood my intent, please suggest a better query. if you did not, then please tell me how I can improve the question. Thanks.p

Then I am guessing there is a switch to run only the compiler. So I can manually invoke these two and put my program between. If so, how do I run compilerand linker only p  pId rather prefer the first method as our builder would probably not agree with me .p

Negative 8403 pIm writing some tests for my DAO, and because a lot of the tests use a test object that is being saved to my database Ive created a setup and teardown method with the annotations Before and After respectively to avoid redundant code, but one of the tests, actually one that doesnt really need the test object, calls a method in the DAO that contains the call getCurrentSession.clear its a method that uses ScrollableResults to get data from the db in batches, and to avoid the memory to fill up it calls flush and clear every 50 rows. This creates a problem, because the clear actually removes the test object that is created in setup from the session, so when teardown is called I get an errorp  pre org.hibernate.NonUniqueObjectException a different object with the same identifier value was already associated with the session [nl.ru.cmbi.pdbeter.core.model.domain.PDBEntry395] pre  pIs there a way to tell JUnit to not use the setup and teardown on this test, or is it better to put all the tests that dont actually need the setup and teardown in a new test classp

Negative 8403 pIm developing a MVC 3 Razor Web App, in which details of multiple categories of objects are stored. Vehicles, Houses, Instruments etc . All the objects share some common data Title, Description etc And some details which are specific to the category in which it belongs to.

Negative 8403 pWe have begun upgrading hardware and software to a 64bit architecture using Apache with modjk and four Tomcat servers the new hardware. We need to be able to test this equipment with a large number of simultaneous connections while still actually doing things in the app logging in, etc.p  pI currently am using Python with the Mechanize library to do this, but its just not cutting it. Threading is not real in Python, and multiprocessing makes the local box work harder than the machines we are trying to test since it has to load so much into memory for Mechanize.p  pThe bottom line is that I need something that will really hammer this things connections and hold a session to make sure that the sticky sessions are working in modjk.

Negative 8403 pIm writing a client to upload files via regular http multipartformdata to megaupload. Now, the point is not megaupload per se, but the behaviour of their webserver.p  pCurl could upload without any problem, while my client couldnt, even by sending the exact same request sniffed with wireshark  but it was stuck waiting for the response, and eventually timing out after 30 minutes.p  pAfter playing with raw sockets and strace for a while, it turns out the only difference between the two is that curl sends the header block with only one call to sendto2, and then the rest with other calls to sendto2. My client, on the other hand, sends every header separately with a write2.p  pNow, sendto and write should be equivalent, if send doesnt specify any flag, and it didnt. In fact I made it work with write, but only by sending the header block in a single call. Every other sequence of write calls caused the request to be stuck waiting.p  pSo the question is how is this even possible Tcp doesnt preserve message boundaries, it being a stream protocol.p  pThe only thing I can think of is that every writesend syscall causes a packet to be sent, and that the remote server is sniffing raw packets and lying about being apache.p  pIdeas Or am I being a moron, and this is normal behaviour for a compliant http server It sure is the first webserver to behave that way to me.p

It then does not let me change back to the previous branch, as there are changes to be committed.p  pThe only way I know of to avoid running into this issue is using  sudo checkout [branchname].

Negative 8403 pYeah, its the old IE6 100 height chestnut, Ive read the solutions but they all seem to hinge on the parent height being set to a fixed value. My problem is that the parent div height needs to be flexible to fit the content, so I cant assign it a fixed height value.p  pTo be specific, Im trying to design a page element which has a drop shadow.  The content for this element will be changing constantly so it will need to be able to expand horizontally and vertically.  The horizontal bit is fine, its the vertical bit which is giving me trouble  the drop shadow on the right side of the content needs to have a 100 height to expand with the box, it all works fine in proper browsers, but the client insists it also needs to work in IE6.p  pHeres the HTML p  precode    ltdiv classiBoxTopgt lt top half inc definable content gt          ltdiv classiBoxCanvasgt lt definable content area gt              ltdiv classiBoxContentgtContent Hereltdivgt          ltdivgt lt EOF iBoxCanvas gt      ltdiv classiBoxShadowRightgt lt Right drop shadow wrapper gt          ltdiv classiBoxShadowRightTopgtltdivgt         ltdiv classiBoxShadowRightBottomgtltdivgt                 ltdivgt lt EOF iBoxShadowRight gt  ltdivgt lt EOF iBoxTop gt codepre  pTheres more to it, but Ive stripped out the irrelevant stuff for clarityp  pHeres the CSS p  precode.iBoxTop     overflow hidden   position relative  width 100    .iBoxCanvas     width 310px   float left    .iBoxContent     textalign left   margintop 10px   marginleft 10px   marginright 10px   fontfamily Arial, Helvetica, sansserif   fontsize 12px   height 100    .iBoxShadowRight     width 11px   float right   height 100    .iBoxShadowRightTop     width 11px   height 22px   backgroundimage  urlstructuredropshadowtopright.png   backgroundposition bottom   backgroundrepeat norepeat     .iBoxShadowRightBottom     width 11px   backgroundimage  urlstructuredropshadowright.png   backgroundrepeat repeaty   height 100   position absolute   float right   right 1  codepre  pIts the last class which is giving me the problems  the dropshadowright.png image doesnt fill down in IE6 and Im a bit stumped.p  pYou can see the real thing a hrefhttptinyurl.com5vfp66z relnofollowherea.p  pAny advicehelp would be much appreciated...

Negative 8403 pstrongBackgroundstrongp  pSo, if you go to a hrefhttpsfoursquare.com relnofollowhttpsfoursquare.coma, and look under the header Recent Activity, you will see a constantly updating list of updates from various members of Foursquare all over the world.p  pNew updates slide onto the top of the stack, and the oldest one slides off probably using JQuery or something, but thats not my question.p  pI was informed by another member of Stack Overflow that this is actually more or less a pseudo news feed. When you load the page, it makes a call to the database and grabs the 30 newest records, and then displays the 11 oldest out of that 30 on the page initially, and then sets a timeout to slide off the oldestslide on the newest. However, it is only consistently looping through these same 30 records you will notice this if you leave yourself on the page without refreshing or anything. It will not make any other AJAX calls to get new messages from the server. This only happens when the page loads.p  pstrongQuestionsstrongp  ol liIs there a reason that they are doing thatli liI want mine to be setup so I can grab a set of records when the page loads, and display them similar to Foursquare, emhoweverem, I would like after I loop through the ones that I brought into the DOM, to then make another AJAX call to see if there are any newer, and seamlessly integrate these new ones into the same flow. Basically, think of this as a mashup between Twitter and Foursquare. Twitter lets you know when there are new messages, and gives you the option to pop them on top of your feed, and Foursquare just brings the new ones in on a page refresh, and thats it. What would be a way to start thinking about this in terms of efficiency, architecture, etc.li ol  pIm up for also hearing if there are any reasons why I emshouldntem be doing this.p  pstrongCompleted So Farstrongp  pSo far I have SQL Server stored procedures that let me obtain a set of records from a given set of a circumstances on the site  off topic. I can call these whenever obviously. As part of these records coming back from the database, is their unique ID. When I display them in the DOM, I am using a codeltspangtcode tag to hold the ID of each message, so I have the ability to make an AJAX call back to the server and also pass in the last ID that was shown to the user, and then I also have a proc that will only return ones with a greater ID entered later.p  pSo as you can see, as far as if its technically possible, I know it is. I can display a whole bunch of messages on page load in the DOM, and then as soon as it gets to the last one, make another AJAX call to the server to pop more on top, and keep updating them. Im mainly asking the two questions above, is this a good idea to have that many messages in the DOM at once And if there are any embetterem, and more efficient ways I can be doing this.p  pThanks guys.p

Negative 8403 pI have an App I am developing for iOS, and the app does the followingp  pLoad and set annotations and launch corelocation and zoom to location.p  pThere are a lot of annotations on the map, the loading from data doesnt take long, but the actual rendering of them them to the map takes a while.. so the user interface sort of stalls for a little bit, and then finally gets the corelocation and zooms to it.p  pWhile this is functional, it is less than ideal user experience.. I could invert the order, than do the corelocation zoom first and then call the add annotations, but this would cause a pause to the UI as well since annotations are added in the UI thread, and not to mention that corelocation could take a little time to get its location first too.p  pSo, the question I guess I am asking is what is the best way to handle this Is there some way I am unaware of to have the annotations render to the map without tying up the UI I could show some sort of Splash Screen I guess over the map while this is going on, but that seems a cop out, and I personally hate splash screens.p  pMaybe the best way to do this is to show the BUSYWORKING spinner over the map until its completed  p  pWhat is generally considered best practice p

Negative 8403 pAlright so I dont know if it can be done, but with the great minds we have here on stackoverflow, Im confident someone can point me in the right direction.p  pSo I am looking to dynamically update the href tag for an image so when the user chooses a different product option lets say a different scent the image link will take the user to that scents larger image file.p  pHeres the code so farp  precodemainimage.attrhref, .moreviews ul li a img[alt  select.findoptionselected[0].getAttributeproductid  ].attrsrc codepre  pSo thats the easy part.  Now the tricky part is shaving down that url that the code gets.p  pRight now it only gets the smaller version of the image to populate the expanded view. I need it to get the larger image.p  pThis is the link for the larger image     a hrefhttpstaging.greencupboards.commediacatalogproductcache1image9df78eab33525d08d6e5fb8d27136e95feedsMrsMeyersMRM64565a.jpg relnofollowhttpstaging.greencupboards.commediacatalogproductcache1image9df78eab33525d08d6e5fb8d27136e95feedsMrsMeyersMRM64565a.jpgap  pAnd here is the link for the smaller image      a hrefhttpstaging.greencupboards.commediacatalogproductcache1image370x9df78eab33525d08d6e5fb8d27136e95feedsMrsMeyersMRM64565a.jpg relnofollowhttpstaging.greencupboards.commediacatalogproductcache1image370x9df78eab33525d08d6e5fb8d27136e95feedsMrsMeyersMRM64565a.jpgap  pnotice how the smaller image has the 370x in the pathname.  Is there any way I can treat this as a string and filter this out  Keep in mind I need to use the .attr code from above.p  pLet the javascript geniuses to itp  pThanks in advancep
Negative 8403 pA fairly common model for iOS apps seems to have a single UITabBarController, where each tab essentially holds a UINavigationController, i.e. a stack of controllers, and pressing a tab switches to the top of the corresponding stack. Can I get the same behavior on Android without a lot of custom code Note I am using menus instead of tabs on Android.p  pAfter reading a hrefhttpdeveloper.android.comguidetopicsfundamentalstasksandbackstack.html relnofollowhttpdeveloper.android.comguidetopicsfundamentalstasksandbackstack.htmla the closest I can see is to have multiple tasks, each one representing a stack akin to UINavigationController, and to use FLAGACTIVITYNEWTASK to switch to another taskstack. When I switch, is there a way to go straight to the top of the stack, or do I need to keep that piece of state myselfp  pOne problem with keeping that state myself Ive noticed that if my app launches an Intent that starts a new process, sometimes my original apps process is killed I think, and all of my global state is destroyed.p  pThe only other solution I can imagine is to have a dummy Activity per stack, to push DummyActivityN essentially right before I switch away from the Nth stack, and, when switching to the Mth stack, to start activity DummyActivityM with FLAGACTIVITYNEWTASK, and then have DummyActivityM immediately finish itself.p  pOne last problem as I navigate to the bottom of one of the stacks, with the back button, I would like to hit the back button once more and NOT go to another stacktask. But this seems easy to overcome by launching an Intent to go to the home screen is there anything betterp

The creation of A and B in linear time is easy to do if membership of A and B can be checked in constant time. hr I didnt succeed in my attempt at making things clearer by abstracting away the specifics, so here is the actual problemp  pI am implementing the algorithm for the a hrefhttpen.wikipedia.orgwikiClosestpairofpointsproblem relnofollowclosest pair problema. Given a finite collection P of points in the plane it finds a pair of points in P with the minimal distance. It works roughly as follows p  pIf P has at least 4 points, form  Px and Py, the points in P sorted by x and ycoordinate. By splitting Px form L and R, the left and rightmost halves of points. Recursively compute the closest pair distance in L and R, let d be the minimum of the two. Now the minimum distance in P is either d or the distance from a point in L to a point in R. If the minimal distance is between points from separate halves, it will appear between a pair of points lying in the strip of width 2d centered around the line x  x0, where x0 is the xcoordinate of a rightmost point in L. It turns out that to find a potential minimal distance pair in the strip, it is enough to compute for every point in the the strip its  distance to the seven following points if the strip points are in a collection sorted by ycoordinate. p  pIt is in the steps with forming the sorted collections to pass into the recursion and sorting the strip points by ycoordinate where I dont see how to, in Haskell, utilize having sorted P at the beginning of the recursion. p

Negative 8403 pSo, this seemed simple at first, but after crawling Google and here, the answer doesnt seem as simple as I first thought.p  pBasically, Im editing a MINIX kernel as part of a practical for my Operating Systems course, and I have to add a little function that spits out the number of running processes when you hit a function key in the Information Server. Ive figured out how to integrate the functionality so all the other stuff works, but for the life of me, I can not figure out how to get the current number of processes running in the system into my C code and into a variable to print out.p  pFirst I thought thered be a nifty Syscall like SYSNUMPROCS or something thatd return the value, but no luck. Then, I tried piping output from a systemps ax  wc l to a file and the file wouldnt create. I tried using popen and no luck there either  even with a simple ls read into a buffer, it just bombs the code and hangs the run of the code, so theres no output.p  pSo now Im truly stumped, and any help would be super awesome, because at this point Ive exhausted all the obvious options.p  pThe only two things I can think of now would be a loop counting all the processes, but first you have to get to the systems process list, and Ive heard vague things said about proc as a directory, but I havent a clue how to accessrun through that or how itd link up to getting the number of processes in the first place.p  pThanks a stack lol pun, guys p  pAlso, I havent included code explicitly because nothing Ive written aside from basic printfing for cosmetic output, because none of the things Ive tried gave me any joy p  pEdit notes Guys, this is a kernel edit  Im writing the function to printf the information in a system C file, then recompiling the kernel and rebooting the system to test. Its a UNIX MINIX kernel, not a Linux kernel, and its not a user mode program.p  pMy code for popen, as some of you requested, is as followsp  precodepublic void cosdmp     char buffer[512]     FILE  f      f  popenps ax  wc l,r      fgetsbuffer, sizeofbuffer,f    buffer should now contain result of popen       printfbuffer  codepre  pThats a bit of a hacked together version from what I remember and keeping it ultra simple and showing you guys thats what I was trying to do. Again though, there must be a better way to do this aside from essentially calling the output of a system call.p  pEdit again the above code woks perfectly from a user program but wont work from the kernel function.

Negative 8403 pI have a few scenarios which I will eventually need to consider in a few months time. Just throwing the question out there so that I can mull on the discussion in the mean time. p  pI am using Zend Framework for my application stack. Im using APC for server caching rather than memcache since as I dont believe memcache offers any benefit for me even though my application is distributed.p  pMy application has been built to work without JavaScript, and then for JavaScript support I break the page down and render the JavaScript friendly version. p  pIf you analyse a simple page, maybe 80 of it is core functionality, which can be cached for every user. Then 20 of it is customized for that user. For example, I might want to display p  ul liLast 5 viewed Itemsli liFavourited Itemsli ul  pThese two widgets would be specific for each user. I was considering using ESI for these components, but then I figured that the most consuming aspect of anymy Zend Framework application is the bootstrapping and dispatch process. So if my application takes 80ms currently without caching. Like 90 of the relative time is spent in the bootstrap and on Plugin hooks, if I were to use ESI to load these two widgets, then I would effectively be adding load to each page Since I would be initiating another 80ms request for each cached page. p  pIn which case, would you advise just loading the customized widgetssnippets via JavaScript, which can be pulled once the initial page has been loaded. The clear benefit of this is that there is only ever one request which is cached, and then anything customized is pulled in a single request after the initial page which is cached has been served. p  pIf Im looking for maximum performance, this seems like the better solution p

Negative 8403 pIm the developer of an inhouse program for modeling harmonics and other properties of liquidfilled shells. Right now, the whole program assumes that theres only one set of physical properties temperature, pressure, etc. being used at a time in calculations. I have already broken all of the calculations out into a Sphere model. I have a controller which owns a sphere. When the user changes the physical properties the controller has the sphere recalculate everything and updates all the windows which are displaying the results of sphere calculations.p  pNow someone has asked me to make a table displaying the frequencies of a specific harmonic over a range of temperatures and pressures. I think this is going to require a new controller that has its own sphere model because it needs to be independent of all the other windows.p  pHeres my question Should my new controller be an NSWindowController subclass or should it be an NSObject subclass with a property that is an NSWindow whose text fields are bound to values in the controller or something completely different Im the only developer in the company and I learned Cocoa on my own as I wrote this program over the past four years so Im not sure Ive always followed best practices.

We would like to distribute this application and allow external develops to create their own forms extending interfaces provided by application XYZ and deploy those forms in a way that application XYZ can display them without having to be modified itself. Application XYZ knows which forms it can display by looking up a config file which lists all of the form classes available these are then instantiated reflectively.p  pWe are using Weblogic 10.3 as the application server and the application is a GWT  Java app.p  pAs far as Im aware the scenario Ive described would not be possible as application XYZ will need to be recompiled and redeployed with the new dependency added to the classpath. I am hoping that someone can tell me otherwise.p

Negative 8403 pThe script below creates a slider widget the takes a definition list and turns it into a slide deck. Each dt element is rotated via css to become the spine, which is used to reveal that dts sibling dd element.p  pWhat Im trying to do is to enhance it so that I can have the option to remove the spines from the layout and just use forward and back buttons on either side of the slide deck. To do that, I set the dts to displaynone via CSS and use the code under the Remove spine layout comment to test for visible.p  pThis works fine to remove the spines, now I need to dynamically create 2 absolutely positioned divs to hold the left and right arrow images, as well as attach a click handler to them.p  pMy first problem is that my attempt to create the divs is not working.p  pAny help

Negative 8403 pI am trying to compare an array of doubles to a scalar double for equality, but equality is never recognized under certain circumstances. I suspect that this has to do with the way the double is represented e.g., 1.0 vs 1.00, but I cant figure it out.p  pFor instance, I have generated an array composed of thousands of double values, the last few of which at some instant in time are given byp  precode10.6000 11.0000 10.2000 22.6000 3.4000 codepre  pIf I test for equality to 10.2 or 10.2000 by the command codearray10.2code or codearray10.2000code, I return an array of 0s. If I place the values shown into an array manually e.g., codearray[10.6000 11.0000 10.2000 22.6000 3.4000]code, then the command is successful i.e., codearray10.2code returns code0     0     1     0     0code. Could someone please explain why the equality succeeds if I input the values manually, but fails if the array is generated in the context of a program I am able to rectify the comparison failure by using an approximate rather than an exact comparison e.g., codearraylt10.20001 amp arraygt10.19999code, but this seems unsatisfying.p  pEdit The values in the array are generated by iterative addition or subtraction of a constant double e.g., code0.2code. The modulus of this array by code0.2code should therefore be everywhere equal to code0code. In fact, the modulus of each element is equal to either code0code or code0.2code, as shown below for the above sequence of numbers in the arrayp  precodemodarray,0.2 ... 0.2000      0 0.2000 0.2000      0 codepre  pAgain, if the values are placed in an array manually and the modulus is taken, the expected value of all code0codes is obtained.p

Now this will post the picture to the page I am interested in. p  pHowever, this works because I am an admin on the page in question.  Other users will not be able to post pictures and the pictures again will end up in their own albums, because the call to get an accesstoken for the page will return nil.p  pAccording to Facebook docs, if the page is unrestricted, as this page is, then it should be possible to post a picture to itp  blockquote   pstrongNOTEstrongp      pFor connections that require an access token, you can use any valid   access token if the page is public and not restricted. Connections on   restricted pages require a user access token and are only visible to   users who meet the restriction criteria e.g. age set on the page.p blockquote  pDid I mention that my page is public and not restricted  p  blockquote   pstrongPage Access Tokensstrongp      pTo perform the following operations as a Page, and not the current   user, you must use the Pages access token, not the user access token   commonly used for reading Graph API objects. This access token can be   retrieved by issuing an HTTP GET to USERIDaccounts with the   managepages permission. This will return a list of Pages including   application profilePages to which the user has administrative access,   along with accesstokens for those Pages. Alternatively, you can get a   page access token for a single, specific, page by issuing an HTTP GET   to PAGEIDfieldsaccesstoken with themanagepages permission, as   described above. Publishing to a Page also requires the publishstream   permission, unless otherwise noted.p blockquote  pSo how does one post a picture to a publicunrestricted page  I can do it from any browser, so it is possible, but how is it done using the Graph API  Given that I can post to the feed with no accesstoken shenanigans, what about posting a picture is differentp  pIn summary, what I am trying to do is to post a picture, not just a thumbnail URL, to a publicnonrestricted page, using the Graph API.p

So here we gop  precodeclass ImperatorCommand  include ActiveAttrModel end   class MyCommand lt ImperatorCommand    def initializeargs, ampblock     myblock  block      superargs   end end codepre  pThis fails miserably, because the block still gets passed up the chain, and eventually inside of ActiveAttr, this code gets runp  precodedef initialize   super   yield self if blockgiven end codepre  pSo if my call looks like sop  precodeMyCommand.new  date date.advancemonth 1  codepre  pit fails as followsp  precodeNoMethodError undefined method advance for ltMyCommand0x007fe432c4fb80gt codepre  psince MyCommand has no method advance it the call to MyCommand obviously fails.p  pSo my question is this, is there a way that I can remove the block from the method signature before I call codesupercode again, so that the block travels no further than my overridden initializerp

Negative 8403 pThis question is about the odeint function in the scipy.integrate module.p  pIm simulating interacting galaxies on the following principle I let two nuclei move in a Kepler orbit and then I take every star in the galaxies to be without a mass.p  pIm working in the reference frame of 1 galaxy so Im using two classical Newton gravity forces  1 centrifugal force.p  pAll this is integrated with odeint scipy.integrate module, which works great. Im having a problem with the speed odeint is integrating my stars tho Every star takes about 1015 seconds to be integrated in about 100 time steps 1 billion year, but this equals to a few hours to integrate for in total 1000 stars. According to my professor, HIS program runs about 5 minutes, doing those number of stars. I dont even have a clue how I can improve this speed, since I cannot change the equations, and odeint is really taking 99 of the running time. p  pSo long story short, how I can improve my odeint calculation timep  pThanks p

Negative 8403 pIm playing around with a toolchain that seems to wrap gcc qcc, but also uses g for a few things. This caused a bit of confusion when I couldnt link libs I built with g using gqcc even though it was for the same architecture due to missing lib errors. After a bit more research, I found that g is basically gcc with a few default flags and a slightly different interpretation mechanism for file extensions there may be other differences Ive glanced over. Id like to know exactly which flags can be passed to gcc to amount to the equivalent g call. For instancep  precodeg g c hello.cpp    I know at the very least that this links in stl gcc g c          I want the exact same result as I got with g... what flags do I use codepre  pThe way the tool chain is set up makes it sort of difficult to simply replace the gcc calls with g. Itd be much easier to know which flags I need to pass.p

Negative 8403 pI have a kind of basic but still unresolved problem. Im building a program in LabView in which I gather a large amount of measurements into a n x m matrix, and I need to convert that matrix into an image to be processedanalyzed with ImageJ. Due to resolution and the kind of analysis I need, this has to be a 16bit grayscale image.p  pNow, the problems Im facing are the following LabView does not have on the basic package any VI to transform data into 16bit grayscale, only 8bit, which kills my dynamic range. Ive read around that the Vision and Image toolboxes of LabView might have more options in that sense, but for companyrelated reasons I cannot access these toolboxes i.e. I have to make do with the Full Developer version only.p  pMy reaction at the moment is to try and build on my own a VI to build a 16bit grayscale image, whether by using standard LabView functions, entirely with C code, or mixtures of both. However, I havent found any clearenough information on the web regarding how a 16bit grayscale is structured, what data is needed, etc.p  pSo, my question is twofold does anyone have a better way of creating this 16bit grayscale image some LabView VI Ive skipped, external software I can invoke, etc. If not, does anyone have detailed information or code useful to generating such an image from scratchp  pAny help will be really useful Thanksp

The following is a supersimplified stripped down version of what Id hoped to accomplishp  precodeclass MyBase      static string[string] dict     static void attachstring key, string val          dict[key]  val       class MySubA  MyBase       various unique member variables  class MySubB  MyBase       ...  void main      MySubA.attacha, a1     MySubB.attachb, b1     writeflns, MyBase.dict     writeflnAs, MySubA.dict     writeflnBs, MySubB.dict  codepre  pDesired outputp  precode[] A[aa1] B[bb1] codepre  pActual outputp  precode[aa1, bb1] A[aa1, bb1] B[aa1, bb1] codepre  pIs there a way around this without ditching inheritance and just duplicating the relevant code for each subclass  The actual code for assigning to the array Im working with is more complex than just the attach function listed above, so Id like to avoid having to duplicate it each time, or assign to .dict manually, if necessary.  Im wondering if theres a solution involving templates that might work, but I just cant seem to piece it together.p

Negative 8403 pI currently have an application which receives live, raw PCM data from a remote source via UDP.  I would like to stream this to a web browser through a simple, straightforward HTML5 tag.  In researching this project, Ive come across IceCast a number of times which, as near as I can tell, can be configured to take in raw PCM and serve up an MPEG audio stream, thereby fulfilling my needs.  However much this may or may not work with IceCast, though, I would like to implement my own, custom solution.p  pSo, to phrase this question in more specific terms, is solving this problem as simple as LAMEencoding the raw PCM data as it arrives and passing it along via HTTP  I imagine this working as a CGIFastCGI application, but I am by no means wedded to this form of solution.  Is there any other magic going on behind the scenes with IceCast  And, finally, to sanity check there is no special streamfile header I would need to send first, rightp

The main point of using android phone is for video transmission. I have knowledge in a wide range of programming languages but not so much with networking. how do i transmit video data from the camera of one phone to another over the network.... Or maybe if u can direct me on what classes or functions i need to look up on specifically it would also be a great help. Since i am not that proficient in networking terms and ways it would be helpful if u would assume that i have minimal knowledge on data transferring over network but i have been using java for years.p  pThank youp

Negative 8403 pI have just started coding an application in cocoa on OSX 10.6.8. It is well underway mostly thanks to threads I have found here. For the subtle functionality I am about to explain Ive looked everywhere and really have given it my best without success. Here is the situationp  ul liThere is a browser chrome for now but the solution should be adaptable to FF and Safari at leastli liThere is my chrome extensionli liThere is my desktop appli lipTextimages can be dragged on my desktop app which then organises these items by source.p  pFor a filetext from finder, except a web browser, tagging the file with its file path is the desired behaviour, for a text I simply put clipboard as the source. Now the issue is that filestext dragged from a web browser should have the website they were dragged from as the source. There is an easy fix for files I have an extension which sets a buffer with the last active url so that all I need to check when a file is dragged is whether it comes from the chrome cache to tag it with the content of the said buffer. My problem is for text. The way text dragging is handled is by a hrefhttplethain.comcocoadraganddroptextintothedockicon relnofollowusing a service which I declared in the .plista, There is a a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions7554170macosxcocoasettingupapptorecievedraggeditemsfromanotherapptowsimilar unanswered question on SOa and a a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions10203402draganddropisitpossibletogettheurltechnique that seems as if it could worka but it is only available for 10.7 on. I also found a link where someone managed to get the url for itunes songs dragged on his application using a hrefhttpwww.mailarchive.comcocoadevlists.apple.commsg17452.html relnofollowhttpwww.mailarchive.comcocoadevlists.apple.commsg17452.htmlapli ul  pIs there a solution to see the URL of a dragged imagetext that could be handled using only cocoa The only other option I see is using the extension to inject javascript code into all webpages for handling the dragenter event and send the content of what is being dragged together with the source URL to the desktop app via a custom protocol. Im not too keen on script injection and I sense some complication down that path as well.p  pIn any case thank you for your helpp  pChocozor.p
Negative 8403 pEDIT It seems that I can only make 2  posts per day. If I remove the Logout step I can post as much as I want.p  pIve looked at many other An error occurred. Please try again later threads on here and havent seen exactly my issue so I feel it does warrant its own thread.p  pI have an app thats sole purpose is to schedule and post messages to Facebook. This app has been working great. As flawless as a FB app can run. I was asked to force the user to relog in every post for security reasons so the first step is to use the javascript SDK to log the user out, then proceed to logging them in and prompting them for their information.p  pThis also works, most of the time... For some unknown reason I randomly get the An error occurred. Please try again later page after I enter my FB login credentials.p  pSo the flow isp  pUser configures the post. User hits send now. We log the user out. We attempt to authenticate the user. The user is prompted by FB for their UNPW. The user submits this information. An error occurred. Please try again laterp  pOnce this starts it continues until I give up. Trying again later does indeed eventually work however whatever is broken needs to be fixed.p  pIts important to note that there have been no code changes in the project at all between when it works and when it starts throwing the An error occurred. Please try again later error. The exact same code works for One, two or three posts and then FB decides it just wont let me do anything anymore.p  pI do notice that when it stops working it stops prepopulating my email address when prompted to log in. However when it works it will prepopulate that field.p  pHas anyone seen what Ive describedp  pYes we have sandbox disabled. Yes the domain matches up. Everything is configured correctly enough that it works when it wants to.p

Negative 8403 pWe developed a .NET web service for mobile application several years ago. This service is being called by iPhoneAndroidBlackberryWindowsPhone and all native apps developed by a third party. We added support for JSON, so some apps access this service using JSON calls, and some using SOAP.p  pThe webservice returns JSON only when the request is sent with HTTP header codeContenttype applicationjsoncode.p  pWe encountered a problem with one Android platform specifically the Galaxy Nexus, where the codeContentTypecode header is missing for GET requests. Our third party app developer tried many solutions but could not find a way to force send the ContentType for GET requests.p  pHowever, we did notice that the codeAcceptcode header is set correctly and sent, but I found no way to change the web service to use that header instead of codeContentTypecode to return JSON in those cases.p  pHere is the example request, which results with XML response, and not JSON as needed.p  precodeGET mobileservice.asmxLogonsystem2ampusernametestamppassword1234 HTTP1.1 Accept applicationjson UserAgent ApacheHttpClientUNAVAILABLE java 1.4 Connection KeepAlive codepre  pAnd excerpt from the webservice codep  precode    [WebMethod         BufferResponse  false,         CacheDuration  0         ]     [ScriptMethodUseHttpGet  true,ResponseFormat  ResponseFormat.Json ]     public LogonResponse Logonint system, string username, string password              return service.Logonsystem, username, password      codepre  pIs there a way to force JSON response in some way, or inspecting the codeAcceptcode header to do so Other than migrating to WCFp  pIf not, I was told by the app developer they use the Spring framework to make HTTP requests. If theres a solution on how to make it work on the app side and force send the codeContentTypecode header for GET requests, its also appreciatedp  pThanksp

Negative 8403 pI currently have a very long running GUIApplication in QT. Later that application is going to be tested and run on an embedded device without a keyboard in full screen.p  pFor easier debugging I have a custom assert macro, which allows me to ignore certain asserts may include known buggy parts I have to work around for now etc. For the time being I just print something on the console such as Assertion XXXX failed abortignore. This is fine when I start the application within a console, but ultimately fails when I run it on the final device. In that case the assert will just block the main thread waiting for input and make the GUI hang badly without hope for recovery.p  pNow I am thinking about how to remedy this situation. One Idea is to just have the assert crash, as the standard assert does. But I do not really like that Idea, since there are a lot of know problems, and Ive always found ignorable asserts very helpful when testing applications. Also I would have to put the messages into a separate file, so I can later see what happened while testing. Reading these files afterwards is possible, but I would prefer a simpler way to find out what went wrong.p  pThe other idea was to make a window instead. However the asserts may be triggered in any thread and I can only create new windows in the GUI thread. Also the main event loop may be blocked by the assert, so I cannot be sure that it will handle the events correctly. I would somehow need a fully responsive standalone window in a separate thread, which only handles a few buttons.p  pIs this somehow possible in QT4p
Negative 8403 pI have a sidebar div that I have given a fixed position so that as the page scrolls it is always visible. Just to make things interesting the sidebars position is set by some javascript code to deal with lower screen resolutions and problems with it ending up in the wrong position.p  pThat is all working nicely, however it appears that the controls on the div dont move when it gets repositioned so you cant click on them. They appear in the correct position they just dont actually do anything.p  pIm sure Ive read a solution for this on here but cant track it down.p  pHere is the CSS for the sidebarp  precode.mainsidebar     displayinlineblock    width35.5    floatleft       padding 0px 0px    margin 12px 8px 8px 8px    minheight 480px    position fixed    fontsize 9pt    left 0px    overflowauto    backgroundcolor 4b6c9e    borderradius 8px 8px 8px 8px  codepre  pand the javascript that sets its positionp  precodevar elementStyle1  document.getElementByIdmainSideBar elementStyle1.style.top  23.2 codepre  pI tried doing the same thing with the asp control but cant get any result.p  pOk sorry  you can ignore this.

The user is allowed to roam the application freely, but when they click on a video, FB.login is called to request permissions from the user and get an access token.p  pstrongjQuery Codestrong p  precodeFB.loginfunctionresponse       if response.authResponse           Set global vars         fbuid  response.authResponse.userID         fbtoken  response.authResponse.accessToken          If user has already authorized the app         if response.status  connected               Create the user record             .ajaxsiteurl  facebookcreatefbuser,                  type POST,                 dataType json,                 data fbuid fbuid, token fbtoken,                 success function data                      user  data.resp.fbuser                     viewVideoitem                                             , scope publishstream codepre  pstrongPHP Codestrongp  precodetry       thisgtfbgtsetAccessTokenthisgtrequestgtposttoken      data  thisgtfbgtapime      model  new ModelFbuser     modelgtdata  array         fbuid gt data[id],         fbtoken gt extendedtoken          resp  modelgtupdate      return thisgtrenderjsonarray         success gt TRUE,         resp gt resp        catch Exception e       return thisgtrenderjsonarray         success gt FALSE,         error gt egtgetMessage,         token gt thisgtrequestgtposttoken        codepre  pThe first time the user does this, the FB.login call returns a valid access token, the PHP SDK is able to set the token, and everything works as expected.p  pHowever, should the user revoke the applications access in their App Settings, and then return to the application, they are presented with the FB.login once more, but this time, the call returns the same access token they were previously given, which has already had its access revoked. Trying to set the access token with the PHP SDK throws the exception Invalid OAuth access token.p  pYet if I then check the token in the Facebook debugger, is says it is valid.p  pstrongEditstrong Further investigation reveals that the user is issues the same access token every time in the same session. If the user logs out, then logs back in, then they will receive a new valid token. But if they try to get a new token without logging out first, Facebook reissues them the same invalid one. When trying to use this access token to query information about the user, this is the responsep  precodeerrortypeOAuthException,messageError validating access token The session was invalidated explicitly using an API call. codepre
Negative 8403 pIm trying to use the codeBUILDNUMBERcode environment property to create a tag that I can pass down to my ANT script so that I can write it to my WARJAR manifest as well as use it during the tagging process executed by the Subversion Tagging Plugin.p  pA minor complication is that Id like to zeropad the codeBUILDNUMBERcode before using it. For example, if the codeBUILDNUMBERcode is 14, my tag would look like 1.0.0.00014.p  pIve found the EnvInject plugin which has an Evaluated Groovy script feature and this script works for me, but I do have questionsp  precodeimport jenkins.model.  def tagPrefix  1.0.0. def env  Jenkins.instance.getItemBnL Build.getLastBuild.getEnvironment def buildNumber  env[BUILDNUMBER] def tag  tagPrefix  buildNumber.padLeft5,0  def map  [APSVNTAG tag]  return map codepre  pQuestions arep  ul liIs the EnvInject option even the best way to go for what I want to doli liIs there a more direct API to get this build than via codeJenkins.instance.getItemcode I know that works, but seems fragile given that the Jobs name could change at any time and thus break the script. I tried codemanager.build.getEnvironmentmanager.listener[BUILDNUMBER]code instead, but I got an error that code[EnvInject]  [ERROR]  SEVERE ERROR occurs No such property manager for class Script1code.li ul  pIf it helps Im running Jenkins v1.488, Jenkins Subversion Tagging Pluging v1.16 and Environment Injector Pluging v1.73.p  pThanks in advance,p  pMattp

Negative 8403 pThis is a problem that has occurred after a Cisco 4400 DMP upgrade to Mozilla 1.8.1.18 firmware release 5.3.5.p  pA C method uses a command line QueryString parameter to invoke a method in a DLL using this variable as a parameter.  p  pHere is the code snippetp  precodepublic string GetChannelOrientationint channelId      ChannelService channelService  new ChannelService     return channelService.GetRootOrientationchannelId              codepre  pchannelId is a QueryString parameter.

If you place a literal instead of the QueryString parameter such asp  precode  return channelService.GetRootOrientation123   codepre  pit works correctly even with the upgraded browser.p  pAnd even though it is null when passed to the Service method, if you print out the value of channelId to the console, it is correct i.e. it is the value passed in the URL  p  pThe situation seems impossible because it is serverside, and should not be affected by the browser version, but there is no other difference I can see between working and nonworking cases.p

Negative 8403 pI am writing an application which will have live and test environments in Classic ASP. These use includes a lot. However, because includes are processed before ASP, I cant simply say something like the followingp  precodelt     if ltTest Environment Conditiongt then gt         lt include virtualmyAppTeststart.asp gt lt     else gt         lt include virtualmyAppstart.asp gt lt     end if gt codepre  pThis would basically load BOTH includes into BOTH environments, and throw an error in BOTH environments if there is a malformed function or something similar in ONE environment.

The only way forward I can see is loading content dynamically via JS.p  pAnother workaround is to have the same virtual directory on 2 servers, one test and one live. However for reasons too complex and possibly too confidential to explain, this option is out the window.p  pIs the first method, loading content dynamically via JS, the best way or am I missing somethingp  pThanks in advance.p  pRegards, Richardp

They are not sent via robots but by real human beings, probably sat in cyber cafes abroad p  pI currently dont have any concrete measures put in place and am trying to formulate the best mix of measures to combat this successfully, as I know my competitors are having problems and I need to use this to be advantage as a point of differentiation. p  pCurrent ideas includep  ul liLimit messages for new membersli liReport member feature .... 3 reports  automatic account deactivation but this wont immediately stop the spammer, they can spam hundreds of accounts in a matter of minutesli lisome kind of regex that looks for recurring themes among spammersli ul  pNot sure what else, any ideas and suggestions will be very much appreciated.p
Negative 8403 pI am writing a plugin that will create some DIVs and apply styles to them on plugin initialization. In the example code below, Im doing things like applying code.disableSelectioncode to some elements.p  pInitially I had these things in a codedocument.readycode wrapper, but then read that that is not the ideal solution, because someone could call the plugin well after the document has been loaded. My understanding is that codedocument.readycode fires the one time when the document is loaded, and thats it.p  pIf this is the case, what can I use instead of codedocument.readycode for applying styles and such on plugin initialization p  precode.examplepluginname    id examplepluginname ,version 1.0 ,copyright Copyright c 2013 Example Name ,uri httpwww.example.com ,licensed      MIT httpwww.opensource.orglicensesmitlicense.php     ,GPL httpwww.gnu.orglicensesgpl.html  ,plugin functionprepare,sort     aPluginPrepare.pushprepare    functionsettingsdoStuff     aPluginSort.pushsort          functionvaluesAreNumeric,sA,sB,iReturndoStuffreturn iReturn  ,defaults   default settings     searchDefaultText Search amp hit ENTER to add to list Text to show when user is not entering a search term    function  Attach this new method to jQuery .fn.extend      pass the options variable to the function     examplepluginname functionoptions           var userSettings   .extend.examplepluginname.defaults, options             Switcher for when the user presses enter before search results come back             ,selectOnlyResult  false             Arrow key navigation setting             ,displayBoxIndex  1                                RUN INITIALIZATION SETTINGS                  availableItems.disableSelection         displayAvailableItems         Set the display styles             tagSearch.css             width 100,             borderradius 5px,             outline 0 none,             padding 2px 3px,             fontstyle italic                   return this.eachfunction                 jQuery codepre

I have installed the latest version of Eclipse. However, the examples shown in the book are not much like my version. For instance, this main.xml file thats supposed to be in the layout folder is not there. The New Android Project dialog box is arranged very differently and the package explorer is called project explorer. Is there a way to get this kind of eclipse in the book Or do I just have to interpret it best I can Any help would be much appreciated This question has been down voted and closed by another user.

So my app could provide user a list of 50 and ask himher to confirm sending in the facebook webdialog.  But what if user want to request to all their friends, sometimes 500.  Seems facebook is tighten this up to promote their Mobile App Install Ads, or App Center.  Ads is another topic.  I already have the App Center setup, but how should I let users friends know about this p  pIve been searching for three days, but couldnt get a ideal solution.  Folks, suggestions or solution  Thanks in advancep

Ideally Hibernate would generate a PK using my IdentifierGenerator then check if it exists and update or save it. Am I going about my architecture wrong or is there a method to do this in hibernatep  pstrongNotestrong I am well aware of how saveOrUpdate works a hrefhttpdocs.jboss.orghibernatecore3.6referenceenUShtmlobjectstate.htmlobjectstatesaveorupdate relnofollowHibernate documentationap  pThanks in advance.

Negative 8403 pI have a website that uses google maps plus my own javascript. I am using the addThis javascript for social buttons.

Negative 8403 pIm writing a simple 2D framework with OpenGL and C and have now run into a problem related to transparent textures and blending.

I set my OpenGL clear color to transparent green and enable depth test and blending like thisp  precodeglClearColor0, 1, 0, 0 glEnableGLDEPTHTEST glEnableGLBLEND glBlendFuncGLSRCALPHA, GLONEMINUSSRCALPHA codepre  pWith two calls to codeglDrawElementscode I draw the fish and then the floor.

I think what happens is that the fish pixels blends with whatever is in the framebuffers color renderbuffer at the moment of drawing and that happens to be a solid green due to codeglClearColorcode and codeglClearGLCOLORBUFFERBIT  GLDEPTHBUFFERBITcode. For each transparent pixel in the fish texture, I would have expected this blending to resolve to transparent as Ive set a transparent clear color but as you can see that isnt whats happening.p  pIf I draw the floor first, and then the fish, it works a hrefhttpi.stack.imgur.com50URR.png relnofollowas expecteda.p  pMy fragment shader is dead simplep  precodevarying lowp vec2 TexCoordOut uniform sampler2D Texture  void mainvoid      glFragColor  texture2DTexture, TexCoordOut  codepre  pDo I really have to manage the drawing order manually ordered by Z coordinate or is there a way to fix this issue Isnt the OpenGL depth buffer system designed to address this issuep  pIm testing my program on the iOS simulator through Xcode.p

Negative 8403 pFirst of all, the weirdness of the problem is that I do not encounter same problem in iPhone, it just happens in iPad. The code below just takes array of Strings which are paths for images in application bundle, and puts these images as imageView to my custom UIScrollView. Its job is just to show a picture for a page. When the user turns the page, it shows the next photo in scrollviews bounds. So the idea is basically paging. It works great for iPhone under the bounds of scrollView. However, in iPad, it works as well actually in its bounds but the problem is that the other images of pages are also shown in screen even if scrollViews bounds and contentOffSet value are not supposed to show them, the pages takes off all the screen as I turned the page even if my masterViewController is also on the screen, so images of scrollView goes beyond of everything on screen and make themselves visible. Actually the images of scrollView are not functional because they do not recognise gesture events, but the one that scrollView currently shows in its bounds. So what could be the problem I googled it but I think no one has ever encountered the similar problem. The code that I created imageViews for scrollView is below but as I said it works in iPhone by not overflowing other images. Thank you.p  precode voidloadImagesAtPathsNSArray paths inFrameCGRectframe      CGFloat newWidth  CGRectGetWidthframepaths.count width for contentSize with respect to number of images so that it covers all images in its contentSize      for UIView view in self.subviews [view removeFromSuperview] removing old imageViews      self.contentSize  CGSizeMakenewWidth, CGRectGetHeightframe      for NSUInteger currentImageIndex  0 currentImageIndex lt paths.count currentImageIndex          UIImage imageForImageView  [UIImage imageNamed[paths objectAtIndexcurrentImageIndex]]          CGRect frameForImageView  CGRectMakeCGRectGetWidthframecurrentImageIndex, 0, CGRectGetWidthframe, CGRectGetHeightframe paging the imageView          UIImageView currentImageView  [[UIImageView alloc] initWithFrameframeForImageView]         currentImageView.contentMode  UIViewContentModeScaleToFill         currentImageView.image  imageForImageView          [self addSubviewcurrentImageView]           self.pagingEnabled                   YES     self.userInteractionEnabled          YES     self.showsHorizontalScrollIndicator  NO     self.showsVerticalScrollIndicator    NO     self.scrollsToTop                    NO  codepre  pThe problem occurs when the orientation is rotated from portrait orientation to landscape orientation.

Negative 8403 pIm trying to write a prolog program that determines whether one list is a permutation of another. Input is of the form codepermL,Mcode, which will be true if and only if list codeLcode is a permutation of list codeMcode. p  pThis is for my AI class, so I cannot just use the nifty little codepermutationcode predicate that gprolog already provides. Our professor noted that the codemembercode predicate might be useful, but any ideas I have that involve it seem to require very tricky and notsodeclarative things and Im assuming there is a way to solve this without getting too advanced, since the class is new to prolog.p  pAnyway, one way to check would supposedly be to see that codeLcode and codeMcode are the same size, each codeLcode element is in codeMcode, and each codeMcode element is in codeLcode theres a use of codemembercode. However, this wouldnt be enough for cases like code[2,2,4]code and code[4,4,2]code, among others. p  pAnother way could be to ensure that the same counts of each element are in the opposite list, but my impression of prolog is that any kind of variable memory is rather difficult business in fact, it seems that the example programs I see that perform sorts, etc., arent really manipulating data at all theyre just hypothetically rearranging things and then telling you yes or no...p  pMentally, one could just sort both lists and check elements sidebyside, but that, among tons of other ways to think of it, seems a little too objectoriented... p  pAny hints My biggest trouble seems to be as mentioned the fact that doing operations seems to be more like emaskingem about them and hoping that things stay true long enough to get where you want.  p  pUPDATE gprolog does offer a codedeletecode functionality, but it comes with the declarativerelated trouble I was expecting, given an attempt like thisp  pcodeperm[LHLT], R  memberLH,R, delete[LHLT],LH,R, permLT,R.codep  pIn the manual, delete is defined like this deleteList1, Element, List2 removes all occurrences of Element in List1 to provide List2.

Negative 8403 pIm developing an intranet site for reporting on data. Ive developed various classes for Customer, Order, Item, Invoice, etc that all relate to each other in one way or another. Each class constructor queries a MySQL database multiple queries and populates the properties accordingly.p  pCurrently, to try and keep code convenient and consistent, Im relying a lot on instantiating classes in my reporting. The problem is, each class constructor may have a bunch of MySQL queries within them, pulling or calculating relevant properties from various sources. This causes a performance hit because of all the queries within loops. Its usable, and I wont ever have a ton of users at once.. but it could be much faster.p  pFor example, lets say Im listing the last 50 orders from a customer. The way Im doing it now, Ill typically write a simple query that returns the 50 order IDs alone for that customer. Then while looping through the results, Ill instantiate a new order for each results. Sometimes I may even go one level deeper and then instantiate a new object for each item within the order.p  pSome pseudocode to give the idea....p  precoderesult  mysqlquerySELECT DISTINCT id FROM orders WHERE customer  1234 LIMIT 50 while row  mysqlfetcharrayresult, MYSQLNUM      order  new Orderrow[id]  more MySQL queries happen in constructor      All of my properties are precalculated and formatted      properly within the class, preventing me from having to redo it manually      any time I perform queries on orders     echo ordergtnumber     echo ordergtdate     echo ordergttotal     foreachordergtitems as oitem          item  new Itemoitem  even more MySQL queries happen here          echo itemgtnumber         echo itemgtdescription       codepre  pI may only use a few of the object properties in a summary row, but when I drill down and view an order in more detail, the Order class has all the properties I need ready to go, nice and tidy.p  pWhats the best way this is typically handled For my summary queries, should I try to avoid instantiating classes and get everything in one query thats separate from the class Im worried that will cause me to have to manually do a lot of background work I typically do within the class every single time I do a result set query. Id rather make a change in one spot and have it reflect on all the pages that Im querying the effected classesproperties.p  pWhat are other ways to handle this appropriatelyp

How does core data manage the ordering of relationship or what is the default ordering if there is anyp  pSay, I got an Header and Detail entities. I specified a ToMany relationship Header can have many Detail and checked the Ordered check box. When I do a fetch on the Header, I can specify which attribute it will be ordered  Im ok with this and my question is not related to this. I put the result on a tableview and when user tapped detail disclosure, I will display the Detail in another tableview. I dont use a FetchResultController to display details, I just access the details via relationship. This means I dont specify any ordering for the details. My question is related to this, how does core data manage the ordering of the Details Since I specified the relationship as Ordered, does it really order the details by default If yes, what is the default order behaviorp

Negative 8403 pNote My application builds on iOS 5.1 and the .plist files are set to only support Landscape orientation.p  pI have a codeUIWebViewcode that has an embedded video in it. When I tap the videos fullscreen button, the fullscreen video is rotated to be in portrait orientation, regardless of any lock on the iPads orientation. This only appears to happen with iPads running iOS 7 and the iPad 7.0 Simulator. The codeUIViewControllercode for the codeUIWebViewcode has a codeshouldAutoRotateToInterfaceOrientationcode method implemented, but it does not get called.p  pIs there any way I can figure out where this fullscreen view is being created and controlled by If I can find this possibly modal view of the iOS native video player, or its controller, I can place the codeshouldAutoRotateToInterfaceOrientationcode method in that controller class or just transform the view to ensure it rotates properly. That said, I dont know what the view is a subview of, or how to access it.p  pI should also note that through much searching I found the codeUIMoviePlayerControllerDidEnterFullscreenNotificationcode notification, which is useful but I do not believe it gives me access to the view for the video.p  pAny thoughts or insight would be greatly appreciated, thank you.p

Negative 8403 pSuppose that we somehow get a dump of an alien computers memory. Unfortunately, said alien civilization had much large RAM sizes than we have, and somehow loved functional languages so much that all the data is in a gigantic, unthreaded, binary search tree with no parent pointers either. Hey, aliens have lots of stack for recursionp  pNow this binary tree is in a gigantic 100 terabyte disk array. We need some way of getting an inorder traversal. There is the recursive way, which uses up stack, and no computer has 100 terabytes of stack, and also the iterative way, which is really manually maintaining a stack.p  pWe are allowed to modify the tree, but only with additional pointer fields and integer fields at the nodes. This is because the 100 terabytes disk array is almost completely full. We definitely cant do something like use another 100 terabytes as mmaped stack or something.p  pHow can this impossible task be completed The really infuriating part is that, hey, the tree is sitting there, perfectly ordered, inside the disk array, but we cant seem to get it out in order.p

Negative 8403 pI have a Windows Service written in C that periodically fires off background jobs. Typically, at any given time, several dozen heavily IO bound Tasks downloading large files, etc are running in parallel. The service runs on a relatively busy web server necessary for now, and I think it could benefit greatly in terms of thread conservation to use asynchronous APIs as much as possible.p  pMost of this work is done. All jobs are now fully async leveraging HttpClient, etc., as is the main job loop with heavy doses of Task.Delay. All thats left is to figure out how to correctly and safely fire up the main loop from the services OnStart. Essentialy, its the muchwarnedabout callingasyncfromsync dilemma.

Negative 8403 pI have to create some nicely formatted charts bar and 3D pie from dynamic data using PHP 5.3 and for output as PDF report. The report is strongnotstrong to be rendered to the screen at all.  I have made the charts using pChart2 as .png files and imported them using tcpdf.  The system works, but the quality level is poor, rendering text as a graphic causes the font edges to be blurry etc. when printed.  I tweaked the image size of the .PNG output, and it made some improvements but it increases the file size, and the text still looks blurry. So what I am after is a library to create charts using PHP that can be exported to .svg or .eps format, so elements are drawn by the printer and render sharply for print.  Using TCPDF I have imported our logos that are in .EPS format, and the difference between the images is quite marked.p  pI have seen there is a library called a hrefhttpezcomponents.orgdocsapitrunkGraphgallery.html relnofollowezcomponentsa that i can give a try.  But before I dive in, is there any advice on what to try before proceedingp

Negative 8403 pSo the question is simple. Given a graph I hope that the structure of the graph doesnt matter much in this problem, how do I go about doing a BFS on itp  pIve recently asked a question about generating a list where each element appends many elements to the end of it. The answer should hopefully let me make a queue I need to do the BFS. But theres another key component that a search needs and its marking the nodes as visited so we dont go over them again. This also needs to have no overhead on the execution of the algorithm. Neither marking or reading.p  pSince Haskell doesnt let me change state, how would I go about doing thatp  pIm not looking for a way to translate my imperative code to Haskell.

Now, since this is a query I run often, I decided to make it dynamic, so I changed it to Query 2p  precodeDECLARE StartDate DATETIME  DATEADDDAY, 1, GETDATE SELECT DISTINCT SomeField FROM SomeTable WHERE CreatedOn gt StartDate codepre  pI was surprised that this query took a long time. I stopped it after a minute or so. Then I tried putting the variable inline like this Query 3p  precodeSELECT DISTINCT SomeField FROM SomeTable WHERE CreatedOn gt DATEADDDAY, 1, GETDATE codepre  pThat was fast again. Looking at the execution plans, Query 1 and 3 are identical and use an Index Seek. But Query 2 does an Index Scan and suggests that I am missing an Index on CreatedOn including SomeField.p  pWhy does checking against a variable suddenly change the effectiveness of the Indexp

Negative 8403 pI am planning to write a multimap like thisp  precodestdmultimap ltkey, baseptrgt mymap codepre  pAnd i would like to be able to store pointers of many derived classes say der1, der2 which derive from the base.p  pNow when I am trying to insert an object into the map, I first do a lookup on the key and then i need to compare if the object is EQUIVALENT does not have to be the same object hence not doing a pointer comparison to the one at that location. So for this lets say I override the  operator or write some kind of a compare function. Now I would like to write the code for this in such a manner that when new derived classes are added, I dont have to change or add anything.p  pSo I am thinking there has to be a generic way of writing this. But not able to think of one.p  pI was thinking of something like the followingp  precodeclass Base      virtual Base  get  return this       virtual bool isEqualconst Baseamp toObj          ....        class Der1      Der1  get  return this       bool isEqualconst Der1amp toObj          ....       codepre  pBut this does not seem to work either. because when i dop  precodeBase bp1 Base bp2 bp1gtgetgtisEqualbp2gtget codepre  pI see that the call to get does end up in the get of the derived class as I expect but then the compiler treats the returned value as Base. This is most likely because its a runtime polymorphism. But I find it hard to believe that there wont be an elegant and obvious way to do this. p  pCan somebody advise.p

I was trying to cache the weights so that for the parts of the row where codejlticode, I could look up the previously computed value for j,i and put that value in for i,j, but that took too much memory.  So I am now trying to basically just compute and fill in the upper triangle for that chunk of the matrix, and then symmetrify it later.  The chunk is from coden1code x coden1code to coden2code x coden2code where coden2  n1  100Kcode.p  pConceptually, this is what I need to dop  precode    for int i  n1 i lt n2 i          for int j  i  1 j lt n2 j              double w  t.geti, j             if w gt 0                  t.setj, i, w                            codepre  pBut the random access codegetcode and codesetcode operations are quite slow.  I assume codeunsafeGetcode would be faster.p  pWould it improve my performance to do the codejcodeloop as my outer loop and convert the row back to a double array, then add elements and then create a new SparseIndexedVector from that array and codereplaceRowcode it back in  Something likep  precodefor j  n1  1 j lt n2 j      double[] jRowData  t.getRowj.asDoubleArray     for i  1 i lt j1 i          double w  t.unsafeGeti,j         if w gt 0              jRowData[i]  w                     SparseIndexedVector jRowVector  SparseIndexedVector.createLengthn      jRowVector.setElementsjRowData               t.replaceRowj, jRowVector  codepre  pWould something like that likely be more efficient  I havent tried it yet, as testing things on such large arrays takes a long time, so Im trying to get an idea of what is likely to work well first.  Ive tried various incarnations on a smaller array 1K x 1K, but Ive found that what is faster on a small array is not necessarily the same as what is faster on a large array.  p  pIs there another approach I should take insteadp  pAlso, since memory is also a large concern for me, would it be helpful at the end of the outer loop to release the array memory explicitly  Can I do that by adding codejRowData  nullcode  I assume that would save time on GC but Im not all that clear on how memory management works in Java 7 if it matters. p  pThanks in advance for any suggestions you can provide. p

Negative 8403 pI am trying to build a MVC app with ObjectiveC. It is supposed to be a questionnaire app. I have all the questions and multiple choice answers stored into a property list, because I have different of questionnaires that I want to be able to load with this app. The idea is that the main model will keep track which item it should read of the property list, and select the corresponding view and viewController.p  pSo schematically I have the following problem. img srchttpi.stack.imgur.comJpfSS.jpg altenter image description herep  pstrongThe RootViewstrong shows the start menu, that selects which questionnaire you will be able to take.p  pstrongThe RootViewControllerstrong is the first controller called by the app delegate. It is supposed to instantiate the model and show the RootView. It furthermore controls the buttons of the RootView.p  pstrongThe modelstrong is supposed to wrap the items of the property list into a fitting datastructure, and supply it to the view controllers that need it. p  pstrongThe SelectedViewControllerstrong is a controller that is a template specifically made for a type of question. The question could be a multiple choice, an open question, a 3, 5 or 7 choice likert scale kind of question, anything really. The template name that these view controllers will really get is ViewController.p  pstrongThe SelectedViewstrong is a tailor made view to the question type and will get the same name format as all the selected view controllers.p  pHere are my ideas.p  ul liMy initial hunch is to use the delegate pattern, and set the model as a delegate to any SelectedViewController.li liI could also use the delegate pattern to the RootViewController, and let him monitor if the SelectedViewController should be destroyed via a delegate message. In that case, I can implement a prepareForSegue in the RootViewController to the SelectedViewController.li liSince it is a questionnaire from a plist I could also add a prepare for segue to every selected viewcontroller, but that will probably be a problem, since there are at least 15 different ways of displaying the questions.li ul  pApparently there is also something like KeyValue Observing, according a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions21010864ioscocoadesignpatternfordatamodelcontrollerto this questiona. So thats also something I could use.p  pI think there is a definite way to deal with this, because the design patterns in iOS are pretty wel described, so there should be a few options for this really or only just one. At the moment I am leaning towards setting the RootViewController as a delegate to the SelectedViewController and let the RootViewController handle the model. In this way I am extending the RootViewController to also hold all common functionality that every SelectedViewController should have.p  pBut I am really not sure if this is the way to go, because my knowledge on design patterns is limited. My question is what is the right option to choice in this specific situation e.g. views and view controllers selected via a .plist filep

Negative 8403 pI have some Python 2.7 code Im porting from Linux to Windows, many parts of it I did not write. Its throwing errors when I run it on Windows that it never complained about in Linux and I was hoping someone would be able to point me in the direction required to fix them.p  pAt the start of the program, it calls a library that creates and populates a global list. It then spawns a couple of new processes. These processes eventually make calls to the first library that refer to the global list.

Negative 8403 pI have an application that uses Boost.Asio for TCP and UDP socket communications. I understand that the A in Asio stands for emAsynchronousem, so the library is bent toward encouraging you to use asynchronous IO when possible. I have a few cases where synchronous socket reads are preferable. At the same time, however, I would like to set a timeout on said receive calls, so theres no possibility of the read blocking indefinitely.p  pThis appears to be a pretty common problem among Boost.Asio users, with the following past Stack Overflow questions on the topicp  ul lia hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions4553162cboostasiohowtoreadwritewithatimeoutC Boost ASIO how to readwrite with a timeoutali lia hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions13126776asioreadwithtimeoutasioread with timeoutali lia hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions6041016boostasiotimeoutboost asio timeoutali lia hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions291871howtosetatimeoutonblockingsocketsinboostasioHow to set a timeout on blocking sockets in boost asioali ul  pThere may even be more. There are even a hrefhttpwww.boost.orgdoclibs1550dochtmlboostasioexamplecpp03timeoutsblockingudpclient.cpp relnofollowexamples in the documentationa for how to implement synchronous operations with timeouts. They boil down to converting the synchronous operation to an asynchronous one, then starting it in parallel with a codeasiodeadlinetimercode . The timers expiration handler can then cancel the asynchronous read in the event that the timeout expires. This looks something like this snippet taken from the above linked examplep  precodestdsizet receiveconst boostasiomutablebufferamp buffer,       boostposixtimetimeduration timeout, boostsystemerrorcodeamp ec         Set a deadline for the asynchronous operation.     deadline.expiresfromnowtimeout       Set up the variables that receive the result of the asynchronous      operation. The error code is set to wouldblock to signal that the      operation is incomplete. Asio guarantees that its asynchronous      operations will never fail with wouldblock, so any other value in      ec indicates completion.     ec  boostasioerrorwouldblock     stdsizet length  0       Start the asynchronous operation itself. The handlereceive function      used as a callback will update the ec and length variables.     socket.asyncreceiveboostasiobufferbuffer,         boostbindampclienthandlereceive, 1, 2, ampec, amplength       Block until the asynchronous operation has completed.     do ioservice.runone while ec  boostasioerrorwouldblock      return length    codepre  pThis actually is a relatively clean solution start the asynchronous operations, then manually poll the codeasioioservicecode to execute asynchronous handlers one at a time until either the codeasyncreceivecode completes or the timer expires. p  pemHowever, what about the case where the sockets underlying IO service is already being run in one or more background threadsem In that case, theres no guarantee that the handlers for the asynchronous operations would be run by the foreground thread in the above snippet, so coderunonecode wouldnt return until some later, possibly unrelated, handler executes. This would make the socket reads rather unresponsive.p  pcodeasioioservicecode has a codepollonecode function that will check the services queue without blocking, but I dont see a good way to block the foreground thread emulating the synchronous call behavior until the handler executes, except for the case where there are no background threads that are executing codeasioioserviceruncode already. p  pI see two potential solutions, neither of which I likep  ol lipUse a condition variable or similar construct to make the foreground thread block after starting the asynchronous operations. In the handler for the codeasyncreceivecode call, signal the condition variable to unblock the thread. This induces some locking for each read, which I would like to avoid, as Id like to achieve the maximum possible throughput on the UDP socket reads. Otherwise, it is viable, and is probably what I would do unless a superior method presents itself.pli lipEnsure that the socket has its own codeasioioservicecode that is not being run by any background threads. This makes it harder to use asynchronous IO with the socket in the cases where that is desired.pli ol  pAny ideas for other ways to accomplish this in a safe wayp  hr  pstrongAsidestrong There are some answers to previous SO questions that advocate using the codeSORCVTIMEOcode socket option to implement the socket read timeout. This sounds great in theory, but it doesnt seem to work on my platform at least Ubuntu 12.04, Boost v1.55. I can set the socket timeout, but it wont give the desired effect with Asio. The relevant code is in codeboostasiodetailimplsocketops.ippcodep  precodesizet syncrecvfromsockettype s, statetype state, buf bufs,     sizet count, int flags, socketaddrtype addr,     stdsizet addrlen, boostsystemerrorcodeamp ec    if s  invalidsocket        ec  boostasioerrorbaddescriptor     return 0        Read some data.   for          Try to complete the operation without blocking.     signedsizetype bytes  socketopsrecvfrom         s, bufs, count, flags, addr, addrlen, ec       Check if operation succeeded.     if bytes gt 0       return bytes       Operation failed.     if state amp usersetnonblocking          ec  boostasioerrorwouldblock           ampamp ec  boostasioerrortryagain       return 0       Wait for socket to become ready.     if socketopspollreads, 0, ec lt 0       return 0     codepre  pIf a socket read times out, the call to coderecvfromcode above would return codeEAGAINcode or codeEWOULDBLOCKcode, which get translated to codeboostasioerrortryagaincode or codeboostasioerrorwouldblockcode. In this case, the above code will call the codepollreadcode function, which for my platform looks likep  precodeint pollreadsockettype s, statetype state, boostsystemerrorcodeamp ec    if s  invalidsocket        ec  boostasioerrorbaddescriptor     return socketerrorretval       pollfd fds   fds.fd  s   fds.events  POLLIN   fds.revents  0   int timeout  state amp usersetnonblocking  0  1   clearlasterror   int result  errorwrapperpollampfds, 1, timeout, ec   if result  0     ec  state amp usersetnonblocking        boostasioerrorwouldblock  boostsystemerrorcode   else if result gt 0     ec  boostsystemerrorcode   return result  codepre  pI snipped out the code conditionally compiled for other platforms. As you can see, if the socket is not a nonblocking socket, it ends up calling codepollcode with an infinite timeout, therefore blocking until the socket has data to be read and foiling the attempt at a timeout. Thus, the codeSORCVTIMEOcode option is not effective.p

Negative 8403 pIm trying to get some codeJSONcode from a server. When I want to accomplish that with the convenience method code[NSURLConnection sendAsynchronousRequestqueuecompletionHandler]code the request fails with strongerror code 1012strong, which means emuserCancelledAuthenticationem. That would be ok, but there is no authentication challenge from that URL Making a connection with code[NSURLConnection connectionWithRequest delegate]code works just fine, without any authentication challenge Im getting an response, but not the delegate call codevoidconnectiondidReceiveAuthenticationChallengecodep  pThis is really strange to me since Im using the same request for both calls. I tried allocating the queue directly inside the call, and then tried to make a global queue retained by the object sending the request. Both did not make the asynchronous request with completion handler work. The response from the code[NSURLConnection connectionWithRequest delegate]code call is exactly what I expect.p  pCan anybody explain why there is this difference between code[NSURLConnection sendAsynchronousRequestqueuecompletionHandler]code and code[NSURLConnection connectionWithRequest delegate]codep

Negative 8403 pI have a problem that Im not able to understand, none the less solve.p  pI am making a clone of Asteroids I call it Meteors, to be clever. Currently I have a class entitled codeMeteorGamecode which is the chief class that does the GUI drawing. MeteorGame extends JFrame to make the window, and it has another class that it uses to interpret keyboard events. Everything works great but I need to scale this up. Basically, what I have created is one level of the game, and now I need a level manager. I call this class codeMeteorscode and I want IT to handle creating the JFrame, rather than MeteorGame.p  pSo to this effect, what I am trying to create is a system where Meteors class is basically a shell that creates a window and instantiates levels of MeteorGame in sequence. I have converted my MeteorGame class from JFrame to JPanel, so that my JFrame Meteors class adds JPanel components to itself as the user levels up. p  pI want each MeteorGame to draw itself and interpret keyboard event entirely autonomously, with the JFrame Meteors class simply working to queue up levels. p  pMany problems.p  ol lipIs using the paintComponent method the only way to draw to a JPanel The way my old class works is it uses a constant codewhilecode loop managed for frame rate to continuously call the update and draw methods that do all the work. So 40 times per second the method draws itself onto the JFrame. p  pWith my updates converting draw to paintComponent the frame is drawn only once, and then disappears. I need to find a way to keep redrawing the JPanel continuously. to eliminate flicker I draw the panel by writing to an image and then drawing the imagepli lipIs there a better way to do all of this Im moving from a background in ObjectiveC iOS development where I am much more familiar with the view hierarchy. Im sure that what Im doing is not the most ideal situation by any means. pli ol  pAlso, when I create a JButton in the JFrame class and try to draw it using the following code, nothing happens. What am I doing wrongp  precodeJButton button  new JButtonClose button.setLocation300, 300 addbutton codepre

Negative 8403 pI have some questions on Apigee API Management solution especially when a customer want to procure API Gateway but want to build a customer built API Developer amp Management Portal.p  ol liHow can we expose back end services configured in API Proxy as searchable services using a custom built portal application We understand, Apigee Developer portal is the way to go, but if the customer wants to use his own portal, how we can make the services discoverableli liHow can user management policies defined in API Proxy be made available on a custom built portal application if only ProxyGateway component is used.li liThe API Portal ships with an integrated content management system CMS for easy customization and corporate skinning. Can this be reverse Can we integrate the API specific information on a custom built portal applicationli liWe understand that Functions such as key generation, user management, and access to APIs could be controlled by the gateway, but how the developer portal would leverage those functions if its a custom built Developer portalli ol  pThanks in advancep

Negative 8403 pstrongHey guys, so Ive been reading this exercise for some time now, and its really confusing. Can someone please explain to me what i need to do to solve this exercise I dont really need any code or solutions. Just some steps explanations or hints would be great. Thanksstrongp  ol liCompute the median of a data file. The median is the middle number in a data set. It is the number that has the same number of data elements greater than the number as there are less than the number. Assume that the data is sorted, in increasing order. The median is the middle element of a file if there are an odd number of elements, or the average of the two middle elements if the file has an even number of elements. To do this, you need to read the file, count the number of elements, close the file, and then once again open the file and find the number you need the middle.li liFor a sorted file, a quartile is one of three numbers the first has oneforth the data values less than or equal to it, onefourth the data values between the first and second numbers, onefourth the data points between the second and third, and onefourth above the third quartile. Find the three quartiles for the data file you used for a.li ol  phint you should recognize that having done part a you have onethird of your job done. You have the second quartile already. You also should recognize that you have done almost all the work toward finding the other two quartiles.p

Later on, youll use the fact that there is an NSNull in there to know if that page is loaded or not.         self.pageViews  [[NSMutableArray alloc] init]         for NSInteger i  0 i lt pageCount i              [self.pageViews addObject[NSNull null]]                codepre  pHere is my codeloadPagecode methodp  precodevoidloadPageNSIntegerpage     if page lt 0  page gt self.saleImages.count          if its outside the range of what you have to display, then do nothing         return            First, you check if youve already loaded the view. If you havent, then the object in the pageViews array will be an NSNull  remember, [NSNull null] is a special singleton which is why  works.     UIView  pageView  [self.pageViews objectAtIndexpage]      if NSNull pageView  [NSNull null]           CGRect frame  self.view.boundsset to views bounds instead of scrollviews bounds because it doesnt work very well with autolayout         frame.origin.x  frame.size.widthkScrollViewPadding  page         frame.origin.y  0.0f          UIImageView  newPageView  [[UIImageView alloc] initWithImage[UIImage imageNamed[self.saleImages objectAtIndexpage]]]         newPageView.contentMode  UIViewContentModeScaleToFill         newPageView.frame  CGRectMakeframe.origin.x,frame.origin.y,frame.size.width, frame.size.height          [self.scrollview addSubviewnewPageView]      Finally, you replace the NSNull in pageViews array with the view youve kust created, so that if this page was asked to load again you would now not go into the if statement and instead do nothing since the view for the page has already been created.

Negative 8403 pI have a DevExpress Callback panel with a group of buttons and a text box inside of it. When the user clicks a button, it adds the message to the textbox and performs a callback. Users can also type into the text box, and when the textbox loses focus, it also performs a callback. When the callback is occurring, a modal loading panel appears to stop users from spamming buttons to fast and jumbling the words up in the text box Im sure I could handle this better with my jQuery code, but I am pretty new to that, so I am doing the best I can. My main issue is that while a callback is being performed, the User can keep typing the text box, and the new text gets deleted when the callback finishes. My conclusion is that I just wanted to stop all input during the callback, so I was hoping there would be a way to disable all the controls inside of the panel during the callback, and then reenable them when its done. I know it is possible to hide them, but that is quite the eyesore IMHO.p  pany ideasp

Negative 8403 pThis isnt all Im doing in my real application, but it boils down to thisp  pI have a function that returns stuff with a space in it. I want to be able to call the function and have the contents be interpreted as a single argument, and I want to do this in the cleanest  shortest way possible.p  pFor examplep  precodesp      echo hello world  echo sp          two arguments to echo, BAD echo sp         two arguments to echo, BAD echo sp       one argument to echo, GOOD, but this takes a lot of characters codepre  pIs there any shorter  cleaner way to achieve what I want to do Im looking for something thats easier to type 4 extra characters is a lot. Perhaps some features that are not part of codeshcode, but maybe codebashcode or codezshcode This sounds horrible, but because this is going to be typed into an interactive session, so perhaps some way to hook into the shell and modify the command line before it is executedp

Negative 8403 pIs there a way to wake up Windows 8.1 from connected standby programmatically For my requirement, its acceptable by using either a store app background task, or a session 0 service.p  pMy scenario is that I have a store app background task to be periodically invoked or be triggered by push notification. When the background task is invoked, it checks to see if a certain condition is met. If so, it shall perform an operation to wake up the device from connected standby. The reason I need to exit CS is that I need to launch a process when the condition is met. This process will serve a TCP connection to run a extended period of time. Its kind of like a remote desktop server which automatically wakes up upon a connection request, but normally in connected standby to save power the device is on battery.p  pThe first approach I think of is using scheduled task with the wake the computer to run option. But according to a hrefhttpsocial.msdn.microsoft.comforumswindowsappsenuse21f2dd7dde540538ef1649ae75f40cfhowtowakewindows8tabletfromsleep relnofollowthis posta, it doesnt wake the machine when in connected standby mode.p  pNow emifem there is a way to do this programmatically, it would be logical to do this as a store app background task, or a session 0 service, both of which get a short chance to run during connected standby. But the question is  what operation to perform to exit connected standby p  pAccording to a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibrarywindowshardwaredn495447vvs.85.aspx relnofollowConnected standby wake sourcesa, various peripheral emhardwareem can wake the device. For example, power button press wakes up the device through GPIO interrupt. So the question boils down to is there a way to simulate a power button press by generating such GPIO interrupt I dont know much about windows kerneldriver programming. Any advice will be appreciated. I think this is a feasible approach as this a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibrarywindowshardwarehh781397vvs.85.aspx relnofollowWDTF methoda can put the system into CS and wake up after a given interval.p  pAnother seemingly possible approach would be to generate a toast notification as a VoIP app. As mentioned in a hrefhttpdownload.microsoft.comdownload5D15D16700701CF49779F825FEEEA4C9FDBintroductiontoconnectedstandby.docx relnofollowIntroduction to Connected Standbya, a background task scheduled by a lock screen app can send toast notification, which emONLYem generates a short sound with the display turned off. Only after the user pressing the power button will the toast be shown. So I assume generating toast in such a way wont wake up the device. However, the document does mention VoIP apps can generate toast notification with longer, customize ringtone, emANDem with display turned emONem. I assume the device might be waked up in this case. But the document doesnt provide any reference to how such VoIP apps are written.p

Negative 8403 pI have been doing an exercise of an introductory algorithm book, which provides me of an array of integers of length n, but the elements in it are ranged from 1 to n1, there is one integer repeats exactly once in it.

For dates, this code returns the serialized value that     represents the date. The code handles strings and Booleans    individually. For shared strings, the code looks up the     corresponding value in the shared string table. For Booleans,     the code converts the value into the words TRUE or FALSE.   if theCell.DataType  null        switch theCell.DataType.Value            case CellValues.SharedString          For shared strings, look up the value in the shared           strings table.         var stringTable  wbPart.

Negative 8403 pI am working on an application where participants can be dialed in to a conference and they are placed into a grid as followsp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comK0Ir4.png altenter image description herep  pDave was dialed in first, then Shawn.  p  pMy problem arises when I try to delete or Disconnect the participants in a certain order.  p  pIf I click the top check box, it will select all participants in the grid and when I select Disconnect it works fine.p  pAlso, if I Disconnect Dave first by checking his checkbox and selecting Disconnect, then repeating the same process with Shawn, it works fine as well.p  pWhat seems to be the issue is when I Disconnect Shawn first, then try to disconnect Dave. The value and index in my foreach loop are the same when I Disconnect Shawn as when I try to Disconnect Dave, even though Dave is the only row in the grid and in a different location within the grid.

This causes my method to fail because nothing is at that spot, giving the error you see in the above screenshot.p  pIf I manually change the 1 in value to 0 in firebug, it works fine, and Dave will Disconnect fine.p  pI am stumped as what could be occurring.  It almost seems as if the grid is not updating when I delete a row, or something of this nature.  This is sort of a confusing issue to explain so if anyone needs further clarification please feel free to ask.p  pCan anyone offer a suggestion as to what is occurring and point me in the direction of a fix for this issue  Your help is greatly appreciated.p  pThank you very much,p  pDavep

So all I could do was codeXTestFakeKeyEventcode which does not appear to support passing a codeModifiercode. p  pA very flaky example solution p  precodeinclude ltX11Xlib.hgt include ltX11Xutil.hgt include ltX11extensionsXTest.hgt using namespace std  int main      Display     dpy      XOpenDisplay0 returns pointer to display     Window      root     DefaultRootWindowdpy  returns root window for display     XEvent      ev                                    Window focus     int    revert      unsigned int    keycode          XKeysymToKeycodedpy, XKF6 returns keycode for XKF5     Window          grabwindow       root         Bool            ownerevents     False     int             pointermode     GrabModeAsync     int             keyboardmode    GrabModeAsync     unsigned int firstmod   XKeysymToKeycodedpy, XKControlL Send modified keypress     unsigned int secondmod  XKeysymToKeycodedpy, XKShiftL     unsigned int keysend       XGrabKeydpy, keycode, AnyModifier, grabwindow, ownerevents, pointermode,              keyboardmode      XSelectInputdpy, root, KeyPressMask      whiletrue              XGetInputFocusdpy, ampfocus, amprevert         XNextEventdpy, ampev         switchev.type                      case KeyPress                              if ev.xkey.state  ControlMask                                      keysend  XKeysymToKeycodedpy, XKF6                     XTestFakeKeyEventdpy, keysend, True, 500                     XTestFakeKeyEventdpy, keysend, False, CurrentTime                                 else                                     keysend  XKeysymToKeycodedpy, XKF6                     XTestFakeKeyEventdpy, firstmod, True, 500                     XTestFakeKeyEventdpy, secondmod, True, CurrentTime                     XTestFakeKeyEventdpy, keysend, True, CurrentTime                     XTestFakeKeyEventdpy, keysend, False, CurrentTime                     XTestFakeKeyEventdpy, firstmod, False, CurrentTime                     XTestFakeKeyEventdpy, secondmod, False, CurrentTime                                          default                 break                       codepre  pAlso using any delay under 500 appears to lead to very erratic timing and keyreception behaviour. p

Negative 8403 pI am writing a reader for PDF file format using boost spirit lexer and grammar.p  pThe problem is, that this grammar is kind of context sensitive one. Actually, there is an object called Stream dictionary, which has the following structurep  precodeltlt  begin   zero or more times NAME  being the key of dictionary VALUE  being the value of the key in dictionary  gtgt  end stream  keyword DATA endstream  keyword codepre  pSo, the data inside the stream has exactly the size defined in the dictionary, given examplep  precodeltltLENGTH 4gtgt stream aaaaendstream codepre  pNow the problem. I need to tell the grammar, to skip n characters. Here is the rule for parsing such object.p  precodestreamobject      dictionaryobject     gtgt whitespaces     gtgt lexer.streambegin     gt eol     gt qirepeat159[az]     gt lexer.streamend codepre  pAs far as I have saw, every operation in this grammar uses the defined input lexer, and the line qirepeat159[az] expecting a character simply fails, because the lexer does not know such sequence.p  pI had multiple ideas, all of them equally wrong.p  h2Lexer stateh2  pFor example, change the lexer state, after encountering stream token.p  precodethisgtself  streambegin[lexstate  STREAMBEGIN] thisgtselfSTREAMBEGIN  streamend[lexstate  initialstate]  character codepre  pThis somehow works, unless there is a endstream token inside the data strongANDstrong it also tries to match endstream in EVERY character sequence inside the data, which slows the parsing horribly.p  h2ABANDON LEXERh2  pNext approach was to abandon lexer completely.p  precodestreamobject      dictionaryobject     gtgt whitespaces     gtgt litstream     gt litrn     gt qirepeat159[az]     gt litendstream codepre  pThis would work, but I dont like the idea of abandoning lexer only for single stupid rule. Also Ive read about performance degradation when using lit instead of lexer, because of the token a hrefhttpboostspirit.comhome20100125whatarethebenefitsofusingalexer relnofollowbacktrackinga.p  h2ANOTHER PARSERh2  pThe last approach was to ignore such object, and parse only the dictionary part. After successful parse of dictionary object check for following tokens, and read the rest of the data without a tokenizer, as shown in the second approach.p  h2QUESTIONh2  pI would really love to see some kind of seek forward or temporarily ignore lexer directive, to be able to skip portion of the input, without dividing the parsing process into multiple places, or introducing obsessive overhead.

What Ive come across is that the Publish script is setting variables at the beginning such as DatabaseName refer to example above. When running in SCLCMD mode from the MS SQL Management Studio, the script will sometimes never return. If, however, I run the script NOT in SQLCMD mode, let it fail, and then rerun it in SQLCMD mode, it executes successfully.p  pThere is a bit of code that I notice returns an error unfortunately, I do not have the error message but I will update when I get the error again when the script fails to return whilerunning in SQLCMD modep  precodeIF EXISTS SELECT 1            FROM   [master].[dbo].[sysdatabases]            WHERE  [name]  NDatabaseName     BEGIN         ALTER DATABASE [DatabaseName]             SET READCOMMITTEDSNAPSHOT OFF     END codepre  pThe script is failing on the ALTER DATABASE [DatabaseName] command. I suspect that this is the same scenario being played out when running from the CMD line using SQLCMD.exe. I hope this helps but I will continue to find a solution and EDIT this post when I do. Thanks.p

Negative 8403 pSo i recently started using the ionic framework, when i tried out making an android app and running it in chrome for the first time it was fast and snappy. Then I added a button which takes you to another screen which has navigation bars and side menus and custom font on both screens, after doing that my app became slow as hell now i cant even click the button to take me to the next screen. The app doesnt even make server calls. It runs decently fast in firefox however if i use ionic serve lab the app still lags there. Also i added custom fonts which when i load on an actual android device shows when i first launch the app however it never shows again on the second launch. I attached the code for both screens.p  precodeltDOCTYPE htmlgt lthtmlgt   ltheadgt     ltmeta charsetutf8gt     ltmeta nameviewport contentinitialscale1, maximumscale1, userscalableno,

Negative 8403 pUpdated Thanks for the quick replies. It seems that I have posted an older version of the code. Everything remains the same except for the parameterized constructor. There are a few flaws in the code as you can see, but bare in mind that I am not fully completed with this. Currently I am more worried about the array since this is a new concept introduced yesterday.  I have tried several different things and researched this for hours.

Negative 8403 pSo Im having trouble with my codeprintResultscode method in my codeTestCandidatecode class. Everything seems to run as expected, except for the column displaying the percent of total votes each candidate received. For some reason, that operation is only printing 0s. For the record, when i use the word operation, Im mainly referring to the codelist[i].getVotes  getTotallistcode operation. Just to clarify.p  pIve tried various combinations of parenthesizing the codelist[i].getVotescodemethod and the codegetTotallistcode method but to no avail. Ive also tried performing the operation outside of the print statement and just printing a variable that the operation would have been assigned to. p  pThe strange thing is, when I take either the codelist[i].getVotescode or the codegetTotallistcode out and just leave one, they both print fine. Just not together and I just cant figure out why. p  pSo, in summary, why wont codelist[i].getVotes  getTotallistcode divide properly Please do not try to do anything but what the question asks for, Id like to learn and fix my own mistakes and best optimize my code as much as possible but I simply cannot get past this one for whatever reason.

Negative 8403 pWhy would the sprite kit physic be different on iOS 7.x vs iOS 8.xp  pI have a simple spritekit scene... I have 2 static pins and in between I have sprites which are connected by a spring joint, dropping an object on this elastic rope would behave like a trampoline, everything was looking ok on iOS 7.x until I started testing on iOS 8.x. Ive tested on similar devices, 2 iphones 5s and 2 ipod touch 5th gen with each 7 amp 8, Im getting the same fps, having the same number of nodes.p  pI have tried all kind of joint, factors, gravity, speed and every time I run this simple piece of code on different devices on 7.x I get a similar behavior, but if I run it on 8.x devices the elasticity is different of the spring joint is different, stiffer on 7.x, the elastic will bend more on 8.x without anything on it but if you add several balls on it you can even see a greater effect on the 8.x devices. before Im asked, here the skcene codep

But Im not sure Im doing the right thing here.

But if I remove the Controller instantiation, it turns out that codestate.gocode is called only once with the param profile, so the redirectin doesnt occurr. Clearly this is not the case in the running application, since the controller is instantiated when changing state and the activate function gets executed and redirects to the home page. p  pSo is this the behavior of tests  Why a codestate.gocode call doesnt instantiate the state controller and Ive to instantiate it manually Is the test I wrote the right one to test such redirectionp  pThanks for the help you can give me.p

Negative 8403 pIve written a server application in C .NET framework 4.5. It goes into a database every 30120 seconds to fetch updates on necessary data using the tools defined in the System.Data.Odbc namespace. The data is stored in a Listlt of a container class Ive created to store all the required data. The List is Xml Serialized and sent to connected clients with TCP. The application typically runs for 56 hours before its brought to screeching halt by an AccessViolationException. The exception seems to be thrown when called OdbcDataAdapter.Fill. Continuing on, the main problem Ive been faced with is that my data collection function causes the working set of my application to increase by about 4 megabytes every time it runs, and at times it can run 3 times in 2 minutes. The data collection process is hectic but here it is in a nutshell.p  pEDIT Ive recently profiled the application using Scitech Memory Profiler. It turns out that the number of managed bytes only temporarily grows to about 1MB and then resets to about 400KB. So contrary to what I initially thought there may be no memory leaks in my application. Yet the process working set size still increases rapidly, the explanation for this eludes me. I have put a breakpoint at the AccessViolationException and hopefully taking a memory snapshot with this profiler will reveal the cause.p  pFor starters, heres what my container class looks like.p  precodepublic class Alert      public enum OrderType              ...          public enum AlertType              ...

Negative 8403 pWe have an existing application that uses MSMQ and WCF Service to receive messages from the queue and process them.p  pThe WCF service is configured as a WAS service in IIS and uses msmqIntegrationBinding binding. The service is called automatically when a message is sent to the queue.p  pNow we need to implement the same using Azure Service Bus as part of transition to the cloud.p  pI checked this a hrefhttpblogs.msdn.combtomhollarchive20111007usingservicebusqueueswithwcf.aspx relnofollowhttpblogs.msdn.combtomhollarchive20111007usingservicebusqueueswithwcf.aspxa article. p  pThe service gets called when a message is sent to the queue but it uses ChannelFactory and a contract assembly from the service in my client application. p  pIn MSMQ binding, my client doesnt need to know anything about the service. It is automatically inferred since the name of the service and name of the queue need to exactly the same.p  pIn simple words, I need to be able to send a msg to Service bus and IISWAS should take care of calling the appropriate service just like the way it works with MSMQ.p  pIs it possible to have MSMQ like activation with Azure Service bus p

For example, if the function name I mapped is aabb, the JIT compiler looks up for that symbol as aabb, putting underscore in the begninning. Therefore it doesnt exactly match the function name I mapped in aabb  aabb and fails to find the function pointer. I am not sure if this is a bug or I am missing a point in mapping function names.p

Negative 8403 pIm working on a project at the moment that will make use of a certain kind of object which we will call Machine in this case. This type of object has parameters, methods etc. pp. and I want to use its methods.  p  pIn this special case I will have a text field that allows the user to alter a certain property of an object of my own class, lets call it Name for simplicity. This property Name can be changed by typing a Name into a text field that is available to the user. Validating this text field will call a method from Machine for a certain object of that class which can be chosen from a ComboBox somewhere else on that page.br As these objects are created dynamicly, I have no idea how many of these objects there are and how they are called in particular, I only know that they exist.  p  pHow would you approach this kind of situation Is there any way that you can basicly say treat it as XY and use its methods as if you were sure it was of a certain type Like a cast Or would you solve this problem in other waysp

Negative 8403 pthis is my first post on here, but Ive found this site extremely helpful in the past, it is my goto when I do a google search. p  pI run a howto youtube channel. Ive finished building my webpages and they are mostly ready to go online, but I need to have descriptions along with each video that appear as it is clicked. Im using a hrefhttpwww.woosterwebdesign.comresponsiveyoutubeplayerwithplaylist relnofollowthis responsive playera, Ive been trying to modify the HTML and DIVs so that there is also a description that appears to the right of each video, with the thumbnails also below it. I tried using getElementsByIDs instead of getElementByID, but that just broke everything unless I didnt do something right, so I deleted that and tried using another getElementByID tag. I experimented with a separate video from the demo just to get it working. p  pThis is what I did. Basically all I did was mimic the divs for the vidcontainer div and renamed it to a viddesccontainer, then placed it directly below the vidcontainer div in the html code. Then I made new divs with similar properties except for the placement. The result It worked, but the second video div was directly below the first. If I can get the placement on the right 23 the size of the video, but also above the scrolling thumbnails then I can put a description in instead. I apologize if the HTML isnt legible, I tried to but it wouldnt paste into this post without breaking.p  pThe demo was set to adjust to screen width and scale down to mobile platforms, but I disabled that and Ill just be redirecting to a mobile version of the site where I wont have a description.p  pI put my edited html file from the demo demo is in the link above in my dropbox. If you replace their html file with the one I have in [this dropbox link][2] then youll see how I modified it.

Negative 8403 pI hope somebody can help me.p  pWe have a self written http server which is used as a proxy to download logfiles from other devices which also have httpservers.p  pWe have a webpage which lists those device. Each device has its own downloadbutton, which is a link to the same url, just with different query params e.g. logfile.logdevice12345, logfile.logdevice67890, ...p  pThe problem is, that those devices do not respond immediately, but collect data for a long time e.g. 50 seconds and then send data.p  pMy problem now is, that if the user clicks on the first button and then on the second, before the first device sent data, the download is canceled by the browser. Also the download window where the user can selects if he wants to open or save the file is display as soon as the first bytes are received.p  pThe query params are completely ignored, the browser seems to think that it downloads the same file and therefore it skips the previous download.p  pI think this problem should be the same as if you want to download something from a database server which needs some time to respond and then try to download something from the same link. It should also skip the first downloadp  pI already tried to modify the HTTP proxy server so that it responds with a head which tells the browser by the contentdisposition that a file with a specific name is downloaded, but no bytes from the file right at the beginning. Me hope was, that this is sufficient to trigger the download window and stop the browser canceling the download. But unfortunately it doees not work.p  pIf I send just some random bytes, it works as expected, but of course the file is not the original one.p  pI already tried to use a form submit button with get and post instead of a href, but it doesnt work.p  pCan anybody give me a hind, how to fix it Of course I would like to fix it in the server, but if there is a workaround on clientside, this would be also fine for me.p  pThank you in advance.p

Negative 8403 pI am making a VDMA that takes a continuous true color bitstream 24 bits per pixel, 8xRGB or 32 bit stream and stores it to an external memory and then reads back from the memory again. My problem is that I have to receive the data via a 64 bit bus to match the AXI4 stream interface. Its ok when I have 32 bit input but how can I run 24 bit stream through 64 bit bus without having to lose all the spare bits To be more specific, the FIFO I use to hold the data while I send them to the frame buffers of the external memory has a width of 64 bits. How can I store and correctly address 24 bit per pixel into a 64 bit wide FIFOp
Negative 8403 pIm in the process of building out a fairly large Angular app and Ive stuck to the design of building thin controllers. My controllers dont try to do too much, they are each focused on one piece of functionality within my app.p  pThere, however, is certain data that is shared between controllers. I aim to avoid using coderootScopecode and instead rely on services to share data and state.p  pWhen looking in the Network tab of Chrome Dev Tools I notice certain services being called half a dozen times. So my question is, is this bad design Are multiple calls to the same service within an Angular app not the Angular way to do things Note these service calls take  20ms each, so clearly not much of a performance hit...so far.p

Negative 8403 pI have a database in SQL Server 2012 Express and there is one particular table which I am struggling to understand.p  pSaid table is has a CI and the following propertiesp  precodeCREATE TABLE [dbo].[HourlyFlows]      [SID] [smallint] NOT NULL,     [FromID] [tinyint] NOT NULL,     [ToID] [tinyint] NOT NULL,     [Hour8760] [smallint] NOT NULL,     [FromTo] [smallint] NULL,     [ToFrom] [smallint] NULL,      CONSTRAINT [PKoHFHour60BEC9D565570293]         PRIMARY KEY CLUSTERED [SID] ASC, [FromID] ASC, [ToID] ASC, [Hour8760] ASC        WITH PADINDEX  OFF, STATISTICSNORECOMPUTE  OFF,               IGNOREDUPKEY  OFF, ALLOWROWLOCKS  ON,               ALLOWPAGELOCKS  ON ON [PRIMARY]  ON [PRIMARY] GO codepre  pI created a new empty DB, with the exact same table and inserted all the records into it, the size of the new and old table is belowp  precode     Table          Old           New         RowCounts     109,911,720   109,911,720    TotalPages    436,323       259,137        UsedPages     436,270       259,098        DataPages     434,434       258,009        TotalSpaceMB  3,408         2,024          UsedSpaceMB   3,408         2,024          DataSpaceMB   3,394         2,015          codepre  pAs you can see the amount of pages and size is much smaller in the new table. Before inserting the data in the original table I tried truncated the table, dropped and recreated, cleantable and always get the same results.p  pNot sure what I am missing here, I have the same results if I reinsert the data into the original table. The only other issue could be that the DB is growing over the 10GB size limit of SQL Server Express databases, but not sure why this could make a difference.p  pThe table used to have more columns which were deleted hence we truncated it, we do this often but this is the first time it does not reduce its size.p

It is a DataSnap based application that works as Web Api server. A codeTDSServerClasscode components instances my codeTServerMethodscode class. Then, when a web connection arrives, DataSnap creates a new thread and call to my codeTServerMethodscode methods. If within the method, a exception is raised, then it is lost because each thread has its stack. With codeApplication.OnExceptioncode, I only can catch unhandheld exceptions from the IDE thread.
