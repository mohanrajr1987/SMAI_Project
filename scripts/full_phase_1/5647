Positive 5647 pIm beginner C programmer and I have one not very big project in C. I written simple perl script for building it with different options. And my project wasnt split into object files, I just included .c into each other and built all with one compiler call.p  pBut my project was growing and compilation time reached 1s I like scriptstyle debuging with lot of change little bit ampamp run steps, so I decided to split my project into object files, link them together and use gnu make to check if source have changed, as everyone does.p  pI expected that this will make building faster. BUT NO make is so slow, it made compilation even slower several times and I even havent split my project completely one .o per .c file yet, just in about 5 object files project has about 20 .c files   It even slower or about same time for make to check if files where changed than to rebuild entire project when .c files just included into each otherp  pSo now I just using enhanced version of my perl script build system. I split project into several big parts and rebuilding only one of them other are 3rd party libs mostly and it works very fast. Also its more flexible and easy to manage for me than makefiles, because I have lot of build option including crosscompiling. But this is reinventing the bicycle.p  pHaving all c files included into each other isnt best practice, yes What should I usep  pI wanted to name this question Why make is so slow but I know why  launching a shell for every code line is heavy task. Maybe for really big projects it works ok, but for me it has too much overhead.p  pSo what are best practices and tools for managing C projects What building tools are fast and flexible I dont want makelike crap forking on every move, making build slower than naive includeallintoonefile even if using several coresp

My solution is quite big containing multiple projects depending on other projects from the same solution. Build in VS lasts in the Release configuration approx. 10mins.

The process is running and using more and more RAM the increase in usage is quite slow 1MB  510sec. After one hour it was approx. 0.5GB of size in memory. When I stop it before the Build method and run it, no new process is created in Task Manager, so it is probably not calling the msbuild.exe. Log file is created, but there is not a single line, it has exactly zero bytes. No bin or obj directories are created, everything looks like there is no change by the Build method. p  pIve reached the dead end, dont know what to check, dont know what to do.p  pDoes anyone have any advice  solution to this problem I would really appretiate any advice leading to solution of my problem.p

Positive 5647 pIve been fighting for a month solid to build a working Cgtkmm3.0 application on Windows with MinGW. I finally managed to get the libraries, MinGW, and Codeblocks to get along on Windows XP VirtualBox. However, when I try to build, I get the following errors.p  pThese are the most recent versions of gtkmm3.0 and dependencies. I got them via MSYS2, though I cannot build in that environment for reasons yet unknown. So, as is oft recommended, I copied them over to the MinGW codelibcode and codeincludecode directories, and ensured codepkgconfigcode could find them. Alls well there allegedly.p  pThese problems are not originating from my code, obviously. I didnt write or modify gtkmm. Yet, I cant get these to go away.p  pIt is worth mentioning that I was last getting errors relating to cannot find glibustringustring, and it decided to stop whining about that and give me these out of the blue instead. If the earlier messages ever show up again, Ill post them here.p  pIm beginning to think it isnt worth releasing this software on Windows at all.p  pstrongNOTEstrong I am getting over 50 of these, all in gtkmm3.0 and its dependency libraries, all originating from line 1 or 2 of main, and all with the exact same details. Ill show only a few in interest of space.p  precode Build Debug in infiltrator compiler GNU GCC Compiler  mingw32g.exe stdc11 Wall mmsbitfields pthread ICdevMinGWincludeglibmm2.4

Positive 5647 pI needed to wrap a maven build with gradle. Bad idea, right, got it, understood. However, I have a large number of code bases that use gradle already, and some that still use maven. I have a set of gradle tools that do all my branching, deployments, and a lot of cool stuff. I want to leverage this for my maven projects too. p  pMy top level task is deb, as Im building debian packages. My boilerplate infrastructure tasks depend on deb so regardless of how each project implements it, it works, regardless of the underlying build infrastructure, maven, make, ant, whatever. Each project just needs to define a deb task and make it dependent on whatever is needed to build the output debian packages. That way the infrastructure gradle scripts dont care about the specific project implementation.p  pMy main question is, how to generate the dependencies within gradle such that I wasnt building unnecessarily.p

Negative 5647 pI coded a Mancala game in Java for a college class this past spring, and I used the a hrefhttpwww.eclipse.orgEclipsea IDE to write it.

It display little red boxes for all of the syntax errors in your document, yellow boxes for warnings like variable declared but not used, and if you select a word, boxes appear in the bar for each occurance of the word in the document.p  pA screenshot of these features in action  img srchttpi.stack.imgur.comXZeTy.jpg altscreenshotp  pAfter a half hour of searching, Ive determined that Visual Studio cannot do this on its own, so my question is  does anyone know of any addins for 2005 or 2008 that can provide either one of the aforementioned featuresp  pBeing able to highlight the current line your cursor is on would be nice too.

Negative 5647 pWhat messaging platform would be the best choice for asynchronous message queuing publish, consume between PHP and Java apps I have looked at RabbitMQ, ActiveMQ, OpenAMQ, Tibco Rendezvous, and Websphere MQ. Persistence is required. I love the idea of AMQP and using an open protocol, but Ive heard of stability issues with RabbitMQ, which seems to be the leading AMQP implementation.p  pMessaging load will not be quite to Twitterstyle scale, but will be fairly high volume and require very high availability.p  pAn officially supported PHP API would definitely get points.

Negative 5647 pSo lets say theres a server process that takes way too long. The client complains that it times out.p  pCorrect me if Im wrong, but this particular timeout could have to do with apaches timeout setting, but not necessarily. I believe this to be the case because when testing the page in question we couldnt get it to time out reliably  mostly the browser would just spin for as long as it took.p  pThe timeout setting would come into effect if there were issues with the connection to the client, as described in a hrefhttphttpd.apache.orgdocs2.0modcore.htmltimeout relnofollowthe documentationa. But if the connection was fine, it would be up to the client to close the connection I believe.p  pI assumed this also meant that if the client closed their browser, Apache would hit the timeout limit in my case, 300 seconds, and kill the process. This doesnt seem to be the case.p  pHeres how I tested itbr I added a while loop to some code on the serverp  precodetoolong  2000 tstart  time.time f  opentmptimeouttest.txt, w while True     time.sleep100     elapsed  time.time  tstart     f.writeLoop, s elapsedn  elapsed     if elapsed gt toolong         break codepre  pI then open the web page to launch that loop, and ran netstat on the serverp  precode netstat np  grep ESTAB  grep apache tcp        0      0 10.102.123.6443        10.102.119.10153519    ESTABLISHED 16534apache2 tcp        0      0 127.0.0.160299         127.0.0.15432          ESTABLISHED 16534apache2 codepre  pthats me at 10.102.119.101, the server is at 10.102.123.6br I then closed my browser and reran that netstat linep  precode netstat np  grep ESTAB  grep apache tcp        0      0 127.0.0.160299         127.0.0.15432          ESTABLISHED 16534apache2 codepre  pMy connection disappeared, but the server was still in the loop, I could confirm by runningp  precode lsof  grep timeout apache2   16534   wwwdata   14w      REG        8,1        0     536533 tmptimeouttest.txt codepre  pmeaning the apache process still had that file open.

Negative 5647 pI have a couple of baseinterface classes each of which has several derived classes. I have a need to store metadata on each derived class that has a lot of overlap, but different values.p  pI also have a Factory class for creating instances of the derived classes thats implemented as a singleton and has a few macros. For example, youdp  precodeREGISTERCOMPONENTMyComponent, MyComponentClass  create an instance of each component BaseComponent base foreachQString component, ComponentRegistercomponentList    base  ComponentRegistercreatecomponent    do stuff with base  codepre  pThe question is how and where to store the metadata from a solid design viewpoint.p  pI could store the data in the ComponentRegister as a QMap structure. When someone registers a component, they could also register its metadata with something likep  precodeREGISTERCOMPONENTMETADATAMyComponent, MyMap codepre  pIf the QVariantisValid for a particular key, you know the metadata is set and available. p  pAnother way would be static class variables or maybe a static class QMap. p  pI see advantages and draw backs to both. Most of the metadata are things like path to QResources for this class which is not tightly coupled to the business logic of the class itself. p  pAnother issue with the static class variable method comes into play with inheritance. You cant enforce overriding of static class variables like you can with pure virtual functions. So if someone forgets...it could be unclear where in the inheritance tree the values are coming from. If you require access to the metadata through a series of pure virtual getters then setting of the MetaData is spread across all implementations of the Base class. p  pWith data held, set, and looked up in the Register if you needed to make changes like changing the root path for resources, you could do so at a single point...in the class registration calls, probably a header or wrapped in a application Utility function. With static data, youd have to edit each class declaration.p  pOpen to suggestions and thanksp

Negative 5647 pHello fellow Grails Developersp  pI was wondering if you could help me with what must be a very common issue.

Negative 5647 pIf one could put an array of pointers to child structs inside unsafe structs in C like one could in C, constructing complex data structures without the overhead of having one object per node would be a lot easier and less of a time sink, as well as syntactically cleaner and much more readable. p  pIs there a deep architectural reason why fixed arrays inside unsafe structs are only allowed to be composed of value types and not pointersp  pI assume only having explicitly named pointers inside structs must be a deliberate decision to weaken the language, but I cant find any documentation about why this is so, or the reasoning for not allowing pointer arrays inside structs, since I would assume the garbage collector shouldnt care what is going on in structs marked as unsafe. p  pDigital Mars D handles structs and pointers elegantly in comparison, and Im missing not being able to rapidly develop succinct data structures by making references abstract in C a lot of power seems to have been removed from the language, even though pointers are still there at least in a marketing sense. p  pMaybe Im wrong to expect languages to become more powerful at representing complex data structures efficiently over time.p

Apparently, what I emreallyem want is multicatch, but seeing as Java 7 isnt here yet, is there a good pattern to let me add state to my exceptions, then rethrow them, without a hrefhttptoday.java.netpubatoday20060406exceptionhandlingantipatterns.html relnofollowcatching the kitchen sinkap  pSpecifically, I have some code that makes library calls, which can throw exceptions, but dont provide nearly enough context for successful debuging.  I find myself having a problem, then going in, wrapping the library call in a trycatch, catching the specific exception, then adding extra state information in the codecatchcode block and rethrowing the caught exception.  I then reiterate through that loop over and over, each time finding a new error condition to log.  I wind up withp  precodetry    makelibrarycall  catch SomeException e   throw new SomeException Needed local state information is   importantInfo, e  catch SomeOtherException e   throw new SomeOtherException Needed local state information is   importantInfo, e  catch YetAnotherException e   throw new YetAnotherException Needed local state information is   importantInfo, e  codepre  petc etc.  I think what Id really like to see is more along the lines ofp  precodetry    makelibcall  catchException e   e.AddSomeInformationSomehowNeeded Info  importantInfo   throw e  codepre  passuming that in that case codeecode would keep its actual runtime type when rethrown  in this case, even catching unchecked would probably be OK since Id be rethrowing them, and theyd benefit from carrying the extra state info as well.

For example this is how the Node classes would lookp  precodeclass INode      INode Parent  get      void Method1     void Method2      ...      void Method30   class ExtraNode      public int Priority  get   extra     public INode Parent  get   THIS IS WRONG, THIS SHOULD BE ExtraNode NOT INode     public void Method1  ...   here I have to define the entire method     public void Method2  ...       ...      public void Method30  ...    class SuperNode      public string Superpower  get   extra     public INode Parent  get   THIS IS WRONG, THIS SHOULD BE SuperNode NOT INode     public void Method1  ...   here I have to define the entire method AGAIN     public void Method2  ...   all methods are identical to the ones in ExtraNode      ...      public void Method30  ...   this is unnecessary code duplication  codepre  pSo 30 methods are duplicated every single time. And this applies for all the other classes. By this method I would duplicate so much, Im practically duplicating all the code. It would be easier to simply copy  paste the entire class, rename and add the extra fields to them.p

Negative 5647 pWe have a lot of legacy code written in CC that maintains data in shared memory structures.  In the CC implementations, for a lot of functions, we get a pointer to the shared memory address then cast that pointer to the type of structure that is contained in that shared memory.p  pI have a need to port the same interface to C.  The requirements are that we cannot change any of the CC implementation and the interfaces are used to access the data in near real time so performance is an issue.  A lot of the data structures contain nested structures of other user defined structures.  The primary way to access the data is to get a point to the structure then directly access the desired elements.p  pMy problem is how to create equivalent data structures in C that are completely unmanaged and can be used in C by pointers.  In C, nested structures can be created using the fixed attribute, but that attribute only supports primitive data types, you cant use the fixed keyword with user defined types.  Most of the examples on the Web use marshaling to access the data elements, but the declaration style in those examples causes the data structure to be managed so it cant be used as pointers.p  pThe following is a simple example of the CC implementation that needs ported to C.p  pDoes anyone have a method for converting this to a C implementation that creates a purely unmanaged data structure that can be access as unsafe with pointersp  precode Structures.cpp  Defines the entry point for the console application.   include StdAfx.h  typedef struct innerstruct      int a     float b     char text[16]  InnerStruct  define NUMELEMENTS 20  typedef struct outerstruct      int flag     int num     InnerStruct data[NUMELEMENTS]  OuterStruct  void fSharedMemory  int tmainint argc, TCHAR argv[]      int a      OuterStruct data  NULL      data  OuterStruct fSharedMemory      while true              if datagtflag             for int i0 iltdatagtnum i                  a  datagtdata[i].a                       Sleep100           return 0  codepre  pI feel like I am missing something here.  Given enough time and money we would rewrite all of the implementation as managed code, but I have to believe I am not the only one who has to interface with legacy code.p
Negative 5647 pI have recently started a new job, and the company uses Visual SourceSafe for source control. At my previous job we used Subversion. One of the rules at the new company is that you only commit your code when you are happy that it works, and that it wont break builds. The other rule is No Branchingp  pThis cramps my style a bit, as I enjoy creating a branch, working on that branch, committing whenever I wish which gives me the benefit of being able to revert if I do something stupid  which is quite often and then merge my branch back into trunk when Im happy everything works as it should.p  pSo, the question is... Can I add files to my own local subversion repository, and not have it interfere with SourceSafe I can then commit to my local subversion repo whenever i wish, and when im happy with everything commit in SourceSafe Is it safe Will I break SourceSafep  pThanksp

Gallery with several pictures that are relevant for the other places. etc. codepre  pI managed to use the popular SlideShow2 httpslideshow2.codeplex.com but I ran into problems with multiple instances of the Silverlight object. If I put two galleries on the page they work correctly, if I put more of them then two of them work oddly for example first and third out of nine. Is there some Silverlight restriction for a size of objects you can load Also  is it a reasonable approach to place the object there more times I wonder if it is a big slowdown.p  pAnyway, what would you suggest to use for the described scheme I dont necessarily require a slideshow of the pictures though it would be nicer but I would like the galleries to be in Silverlight.p  pEDIT  Slideshow2 link correctedp

Negative 5647 pstrong[ EDIT ] strong To clarify, in those environments where multiple targets are deployed to the same directory, Planet Earth has decided on a convention to append codedcode or codedcode or codedebugcode to the codeDEBUGcode version of a library or executable.  Such a convention can be considered ubiquitous and understood, although of course not everybody does this.p  pSIMILARLY, to resolve ambiguity between shared and static versions of a library, a common convention is to append something to distinguish between the staticandshared like codemyfile.libcode for sharedimportlibonWindows and codemyfiles.libcode for staticimportlibonWindows.  While Posix does not have this ambiguity based on file extension, remember that the file extension is not used on the link line, so it is similarly useful to be able to explicitly specify the static or shared version of a library.p  pFor the purpose of this question, both codedebugreleasecode and codestaticsharedcode are promoted to emubiquitous convention to decorate the file name rootem.p  pemstrongQUESTIONem  Does any other deployment configuration get promoted to this level of ubiquitous convention such that it would become explicit in the file target root namestrongp  pMy current guess is no.  For the answer to be Yes, it would require  More than one configuration for given target is intended to be used and thus deployed to a common directory, which is the assumed basis for the question.p  pIn the past, we compiled withandwithout web plugin capability, which similarly required that name decoration, but we no longer build those targets so I wont assert that as an example.  Similarly, we sometimes compile withandwithout multibyte character support, but I hate that, so I wont assert that either.p  pstrong[ORIGINAL QUESTION]strongp  pWere strongestablishing library naming conventionsstrongpolicy, strongto be applied across languages and platformsstrong e.g., we support hybrid products using several languages on different platforms, including CC, C, Java.  A particular goal is to ensure we handle targetsresources for mobile development which is new to us in addition to our traditional desktop and embedded applications.p  pOf course, emoneem option is to have different paths for targets from different build configurations.  For the purpose of this question, the decision is made to have all targets colocate to a single directory, and to decorate the libraryresourceexecutable name to avoid collisions based on build configuration e.g., DEBUG v. RELEASE, static lib v. sharedDLL, etc.p  pCurrent decision is similar to others on the web, where we append tokens to avoid naming collisionsp  precode  MyName.lib           release build, import for shareddll   MyNames.lib         release build, static lib    MyNamed.lib         debug build, import for sharedDLL   MyNameud.lib        Unicodewidechar, debug, import for sharedDLL   MyNameusd.lib       Unicodewidechar, static lib, debug codepre  pThe above are Windows examples, but these policies similarly apply to our POSIX systems.p  pThese are based onp  precode  d     release or debug   u     ASCII or Unicodewidechar   s     sharedDLL or staticlib codepre  pemQUESTIONem  We do not have legacy applications that must be compiled singlethreaded, and my understanding is that unlike Microsoft POSIX systems can link single and multithreaded targets into a single application without issue.

If you have binary data in a node.js Buffer object and you call toString instead of .toStringbinary, it gets all kinds of scrambled as stuff is escaped or escape sequences are interpreted or whatever.

Negative 5647 pstrongBounty short descriptionstrongp  pIs there a emportableem way to use stronga single repository w multiple checkoutsstrong As an alternative to having  multiple clones where there is just too much overhead pushingpullingsyncing... and the risk of overwriting the code.gitobjectscode hard links which does not even work on Windows.p  hr  pNew to git and curious to hear thoughts from experienced git users.p  pIs there a conceptual reason why git only works with ONE branch at a time It seems absolutely impractical having to switch back and forward between branches, when most of the time I need to work on at least two different branches at the same time, e.g. building, running in parallel a.s.o.p  pOk, so maybe a developer does not really need to work on two branches exactly at the same time. But checking out another branch does not automatically carry ignored stuff like build output files. So a new rebuild is required a.s.o.p  pThere is this script codegitnewworkdircode that is supposed to allow multiple working branches, but for one, it is not part of the git release althoug it has been around for about 3 years, so I do not trust it to keep my files consistent. And secondly, I cannot find it as part of the Windows distribution, which is one of the machines I use for development.p  pSo the only official option is to create a new clone for every branch, which seems incorrect, since each clone is a fullblown repository. I would not even know what to call the clone directories  do I use the repository name or the branch name or both What if I create another branch off that branch, a.s.o.p  pstrongRealuse case updatestrong emPhilips suggestionemp  pI usually work on two majorminor releases, with features going on both in parallel. There is also an occasional development branch, where experimental features go into, before being merged to some future release.p  pDuring feature development, often behaviour degrades and it is more efficient to compare it with the behaviour before the changes. Checking out a previous branchrevision is not good enough, because many times it comes down to debugging sidebyside, which means both revisions need to be checked out simultaneously on the harddrive.p  pSo the more convenient and natural approach would be to keep a few socalled active branches checked out each in its own directory, with its own compiled binaries. This would also save compilation time and occasional local setup i.e. configuration files that need to be changed after every checkout in order to get the product running.p

Negative 5647 pI have a very simple Core data Model comprising of a single Gallery which contains multiple Images. It seems to me that it should be enough for a Gallery to have a onetomany relationship with Image, but if I dont also establish an inverse relationship from Image back to gallery I get Compiler warnings and errors. From an objectoriented perspective it seems to me that an Image shouldnt know or care if it is in a Gallery or any other ManagedObject so why does the compiler force me to create this inverse relationship Having a gallery property on the image seems very wrong.p

Negative 5647 pI would like to implement a simple, inmemory OLAP cube storage engine for read and write writeback  functionally similar to SSAS cube with multiple dimensions but one measure and only with 1 type of aggregation sum.

Negative 5647 pThis question comes after a friends comment. He said that when a query has a lot of subqueries, its a signal that the database has design flaws and they must be avoided. He also said that many books suggest the same.p  pI agree in parts, but I think that are queries that have complex logic that a lot of subqueries are needed, or, to avoid the subqueries, a materialized view of a query or a lot of data redundancy.p  pSo, what is the truth about subqueries Must they always be avoided No problems with them Do they indicate database design flaws Is it possible to have a database design that allows complex queries without having data redundancyp

I had to go based on the Relative hierarchy up the datagrid...p  precodeltButton NamebtnPrintReport     CommandBinding DataContext.MyPrintCommand,               RelativeSourceRelativeSource FindAncestor,                               AncestorTypexType DataGrid    CommandParameterBinding    Height16 Width16 HorizontalAlignmentCenter gt    ltImage SourceMyButtonImage.png IsHitTestVisibleTruegt ltButtongt codepre  pHope something not too complicated in WPF  MVVM environment.  Heres the scenario.p  pI have a Window .xaml and a corresponding View Model .cs.  The form displays fine with all the data bindings no problem. note this is NOT done via any commercial framework p  pOne of the controls that is in the view window is a custom user control of a datagrid with all predefined columns, headings and content to be displayed when the view is shown.  This works all no problem even though the control is not directly defined in the main window .xaml file, but just dropped on the form as the user control itself which has its own obvious .cs codebehind.p  pWith the main windows DataContext pointing to the View Model, and the user control that has a datagridp  precodeltDataGrid AutoGenerateColumnsFalse      NamedataMyStuff     ItemsSourceBinding PathMyTablePropertyOnViewModel,          NotifyOnSourceUpdatedTrue,          NotifyOnTargetUpdatedTrue ... gt codepre  pNow, what Im looking for.  On this data grid, I have a column that has an image in the first column.  When I click on this image, I want to print a report specific to the record as represented by this row it has a PK value I use.  So, how do I tell the image KeyUp event to go to the View Model event handler since that is where the data is, and some other methods Ill need for preparing the call to the report.  The view portion of the grid is for cosmetic display to the user, and thus no functionality directly in this control.p  pstrong EDIT  per progress from answersstrongp  pIve adjusted my datagrid per comments from Josh and Rachel, however, something still does not appear to be quite right...  Seeing the button was using a Command instance, I interpreted this as it needed to attach to an instance of an ICommand interface object on my view model.  So, I created an instance.  I know the command handler works as it is also used for common things like Add, Edit, Save, Cancel, Exit, etc...  So I have a new one for this printing purpose.  For simplicity, I have it created as an Always Execute, so there is no method to handle the CanExecute portion of the control.    Ive set the buttons Command to almost all iterations I could think of an still nothing, but heres an update of what Im seeing going on.p  precodeltUserControlgt    ltData grid columns  template, etc to the buttongt       ltDataTemplategt           ltButton NamebtnPrintReport              CommandBinding DataContext.MyPrintCommand gt             ltImage SourcemyPrintImage.pnggt          ltButtongt       ltDataTemplategt    ltData grid columns, etcgt ltUserControlgt codepre  pIn my ViewModel class myICommandButtonHandler inherits from ICommandp  precodeprivate myICommandButtonHandler myPrintCommand public myICommandButtonHandler MyPrintCommand     get  if myPrintCommand  null             myPrintCommand  new myICommandButtonHandlermyPrint          return myPrintCommand           private void myPrint     MessageBox.Show Doing the print job...   codepre  pNow, what Im seeing.  During step through initialization of all the controls and such.  I click menu item to call my Window to be displayed.  FIRST, it creates an instance of the View Model controller.  THEN, it calls the Window and passes in the View Model controller as parameter so it is immediately set at the Window level as the DataContext of the window.  The main window then goes into its InitializeComponents call and starts to build out all the other controls embedded, including this separate class that contains the data grid in question.  At the constructor of this usercontrol that has the datagrid, there is no data context set yet as the rest of the controls have not been initialized yet, and I dont know  why  when the bindings apparently get hooked in.  So, it appears that trying to do the binding to the data grids command button are failing. HOWEVER, at runtime, the actual data IS updated in the grid, so I know that much is working.p  pSo, the data grid has its ItemsSource set to a property of a DataView property on the view model, but the binding of the button doesnt appear to see the MyPrintCommand handler that I thought would get the hit.. and its action is to just display a message box for now.p

Negative 5647 pJust build a site and were having issues with IE7 users.  It had nothing to do with my programming, but a site we have to redirect the customers to that does not handle IE7.  Problem is that the client base is not overly tech savvy and telling them to update their version of IE requires they understand what version of Windows theyre using XP or Vista and also whether their version is 32bit or 64bit which Im sure will really scare the users off.  p  pThe issue pretty much boils down to needing to find a way to detect what version of Windows theyre using XP or Vista ... Windows 7 wont run IE7 and then find a way to alert them as to whether theyre using 32bit or 64bit and direct them accordingly.p  pNot sure if anyone else has come across this problem and curious how theyve handled it.p

Negative 5647 pIve been doing some testing with ServiceStack, particularly against WCF.  Overall Ive been pleased with the performance but encountered during one of my tests a breakdown in performance.  Ive been hitting the test ServiceStack based service with a simple WebClient calls returning JSON data from the service.  The test returns a larger set of plain .net objects 100 resembling an address.p  pServiceStack processes the first couple or so dozen in good times when running sets of 100.  However towards the later part of the set times jump considerably.  The obvious is that requests are queuing.  Im running on a desktop so Im not expecting stellar performance but I was looking for any suggestions to help speed up ServiceStack.p

Negative 5647 pI would like to preface this wall of text by saying, I am very new at this. I may be missing something obvious.p  pIm working in Flash CS5 with Actionscript 3. Im trying to use actionscript to create a textfield, and populate it with text. Ive embedded my font in my project using the Font Embedding window. However, when the code to create the textfield is run, if embedFont  true, the font is invisible. The cursor still changes when hovering over it, so I know its there. Or at least its text box is, I guess. Dynamic textfields with embedded text which are already on the stage seem to be unaffected. p  pIve tried changing the embedded fonts outline format, neither work. Ive tried directly embedding the font with the embed tag via actionscript, but it doesnt seem to work with CS5, or I dont know what Im doing. As you can see in the code provided, Ive tried registering the font, with no success. Ive tried usingp  precodevar fontFont  new screenfont screenfont is the name from Embedding Fonts      var formatTextFormat  new TextFormat  format.font  screenfont.fontName codepre  pNo dice.p  pIve followed some different tutorials about embedding, and come across a wealth of conflicted, confusing information. Ive read a few different posts pertaining to this subject, but havent found any viable solutions as of yet.p  pHeres a simple version of my code, where screenfont is the name I specified in the Embedding Fonts windowp  precodeFont.registerFontscreenfont              TextFormat var listformatTextFormat  new TextFormat  listformat.align  TextFormatAlign.LEFT listformat.size  20.8 listformat.color  0x0DAC54 listformat.fontFixedsys Excelsior 3.01              TextField var photolistTextField  new TextField     photolist.x  photosx     photolist.y  tempY     photolist.width  photoswdth     photolist.height  photoshght     photolist.text  photoname      photolist.embedFonts  true lt This freakin guy      photolist.antiAliasType  AntiAliasType.ADVANCED     photolist.defaultTextFormatlistformat     photolist.selectable  false     photolist.wordWrap   true      mediapage.photos.addChildphotolist codepre  pI hope this provides a clear picture.p  pSo, how exactly is embedding accomplished in CS5p

Negative 5647 pI have an old application written in Visual C 6. Part of this app is drawing text into a bitmap. This works fine on Windows XP but when the same code is run on Windows 7 all the text is shifted by one place in the ASCII table.p  pFor example, codeCategorycode becomes codeBsdfnqxcode.p  pAny ideas what is causing this and how to fix itp  pEdit Sorry but the above is slightly incorrect. When I saw the DrawText function in the code I assumed it was the GDI function. When I step into it, it turns out that the author has created their own codeDrawTextcode function which is using codeOpenGLcode. I dont know any codeOpenGLcode so this has now got out of hand. It calls codeglCallListscode which passes the text stored in a codeCStringcode into this function.p  pFull class code below.

It seems odd that when you use a constructor that specifies a ClientConfig the ClientConfig gets overridden by the rootClients config.p
Negative 5647 pI am accessing a UniVerse database and reading out all the records in it for the purpose of synchronizing it to a MySQL database which is used for compatibility with some other applications which use the data. Some of the tables are 250,000 records long with 100 columns and the server is rather old and still used by many simultaneous users and so it takes a very ... long ... time to read the records sometimes.p  pExample I execute SSELECT ltfilegt TO 0 and begin reading through the select list, parsing each record into our data abstraction type and putting it in a .NET List. Depending on the moment, fetching each record can take between 250ms to 34 second depending on database usage. Removing the methods for extraction only speeds it up marginally since I think it still downloads all of the record information anyway when I call UniFile.read even if I dont use it.p  pReading 250,000 records at this speed is prohibitively slow, so does anyone know a way I can speed this up Is there some option I should be setting somewherep

Negative 5647 pI just released some code into production that is randomly causing errors.  I already fixed the problem by totally changing the way I was doing the query.  However, it still bothers me that I dont know what was causing the problem in the first place so was wondering if someone might know the answer.  I have the following query inside of a stored procedure.  Im not looking for comments about thats not a good practice to make queries with nested function calls and things like that .  Just really want to find out why it doesnt work consistently.  Randomly the function in the query will return a nonnumeric value and cause an error on the join.

Negative 5647 pOk Im going to talk about paypal. The reason for this is its really hard to get a merchant account that will accept that you are selling digital goods. So for that reason paypal is the only simple option.p  pMy reason for posting this is there is a lot of old info about chargebacks and paypal. I thought I will share here what I have found, that way people who know more than me to point out any mistakes. p  pstrongThe pointstrongp  pPayPal does not protect buyers OR sellers where intangible goods are involved. p  pstrongWhat this meansstrongp  pThe important bit here is the fact PayPal does not protect both buyer or sellers. This means if someone tries to chargeback through PayPal for an intangible product  service you provided. You only need to tell PayPal it was for intangible goods and the case should be closed. p  pBut as you will read people are always losing chargebacks cases where PayPal is involved. This is down to the fact that though PayPal will not protect the buyer for the intangible goods, the credit card company used to buy the product will. So the chargeback is actually from the credit card company taking the money from PayPal , then PayPal taking the money from you. In this case, it seems there is nothing you can do and just accept it. p  pThere are many reasons a credit card company will perform a charge back. One of the big ones is stolen credit cards. Which is the one that worries me the most. p  pBut this got me thinking that here in the UK a lot of websites use 3D Secure which is basically an additional layer of security that means you have to enter a password each time you use your credit card. This is meant to shift the liability from the merchant to the card company.p  pAfter a little digging I found that PayPal does offer Buyer Authentication in the forms of Verified by visa and MasterCard SecureCode Pretty much same thing as 3D secure. p  pExcellent This then seriously reduces the risk of being the victim of a stolen credit card. But it will reduce sales due to a lot of people not wanting that extra step. p  pBut what it doesnt help with is people doing chargebacks for other reasons. Such as I didnt get the item, it was not as described, Im just a bit of a dick and will just want to try and scam you.p  pstrongOk with all this in mind here are my questionsstrongp  p1 PayPal will not protect you from credit card chargebacks on digital items. But does that mean you cannot try and provide evidence directly to the credit card companyp  p2  Is there ANY form of guaranteed evidence you can provide that someone has purchased and used a intangible good  service you have provided that would be acceptable to credit card companies. Preferably that doesnt rely on the faxing of personal detailsp

Negative 5647 pI would like to write a program that Pins an APPLICATION like Microsoft WORD, EXCEL, and POWERPOINT to the taskbar on windows 7 or 8. I found the directory that hosts the shortcuts APPDATAMicrosoftInternet ExplorerQuick LaunchUser PinnedTaskBar however, when I create a shortcut and move it to that folder, the icon does not appear in the taskbar.

Negative 5647 pIve got a Maven project that Im trying to configure to use the maven release plugin.  Part of the release process is to use the Maven GPG Plugin to sign artifacts which requires among other things, the GPG signing key passphrase to succeed.  Because these builds need to be runnable in a non interactive environment, CIServer these params are passed in as arguments to maven in the form of p  precodeDgpg.passphraseXXX codepre  pFor snapshot builds everything works fine the Maven GPG Plugin sees the passed in passphrase, artifacts are built, signed and deployed as expected, however, when I try to use the release plugin I get prompted for the gpg signing key password.  Ive read through several discussions on similar issues that stem from the release plugin forking another invocation of maven which does not receive the passed in params.  The most popular fix seems to be to use the arguments parameter like thisp  precodeDargumentsDgpg.passphraseXXX codepre  pSupposedly this gets passed to the forked instance but unfortunately for me its not getting rid of the prompt.p  pSince signing artifacts is not an uncommon prerequisite for deploying release artifacts to public maven repos and presumably most entities producing those artifacts are using some form of CI I cant imagine Im the only person who has encountered this problem.  Has anybody found a workaroundp  pstrongA NOTE ABOUT THE ACCEPTED ANSWERstrongp  pThe accepted solution will not work with Maven 3.0  3.0.3 and 3.0.3 just so happens to be what installs by default with java on OSX Mountain Lion.  a hrefhttpjira.codehaus.orgbrowseMNG5224See herea for the details.

Negative 5647 pI am using XMLHttpRequest responseText to GET a server txt file and load the contents of that file into an editable text box.

In IE8  when the contents of txt file are loaded the editable text box looks like it is seperated by new lines but if I copy that newly loaded text and paste it into vim there are no n or r characters just space.

Negative 5647 pIve spent the past two days troubleshooting this problem for my portfolio website, and have yet to find a solution.p  pThe basic structure of the page is a header, a wrapper for content nav bar and content divs, and the footer. The problem is that the footer is cutting through the middle of the wrapper div, making the content run around and below the footer. I would post a screenshot, but I dont have enough reputation.p  pIt looks like the div containing the rsum info is the only one causing the problem, whereas the footer is only corresponding to the nav bar.p  pCode is below.p  pstrongAdditional infostrong When I tried setting the footers position to fixed, it disappears completely from the page. I also tried removing the .wrapper div and just using the content divs. I also tried changing the positions of the divs to absolute and relative.p  h2HTMLh2  precodeltDOCTYPE html5gt lthtmlgt ltheadgt ltmeta charsetutf8 gt ltmeta nameviewport contentwidthdevicewidth, initialscale1.0 gt ltlink relicon hreffavicon.png gt ltlink relstylesheet hrefmain.css gt ltlink relstylesheet hrefwebfonts.css gt  lttitlegtKyle Simmonds Design, Writing and Weblttitlegt  ltheadgt ltbodygt  ltheadergt     ltlta classheaderlogo hrefhttpkylesimmonds.comgtlth1gtKyle Simmondslth1gtltagtgt     lta hrefindex.htmlgt             ltulgt                 ltli idtitlegtKyle Simmondsltligt                 ltli idsubtitlegtCopywriting, Graphic Design and Web Developmentltligt             ltulgt     ltagt ltheadergt  ltdiv classwrappergt  lt NAVIGATION BAR gt     ltnavgt                    ltul classfirstlevelgt                 ltligtlta hrefindex.htmlgtHomeltagtltligt                 ltligtlta hrefresume.htmlgtRampeacutesumampeacuteltagtltligt                 ltligtlta hrefportfolio.htmlgtPortfolioltagtltligt                 ltligtlta hrefblog.htmlgtMusingsltagtltligt                 ltligtlta hrefcontact.htmlgtltfont colorf00gtContact Meltfontgtltagt                     ltul classsecondlevelgt                         ltligtEmail lta hrefmailtokbsimmondsgmail.comgtkbsimmondsgmail.comltagtltligt                     ltulgt                 ltligt             ltulgt     ltnavgt      ltdiv classcontent idresumegt          lth2gtABOUT MElth2gt             ltpgtltpgt lthr gt         lth2gtEXPERIENCElth2gt             lth4gtGullivers Travellth4gt             ltulgt                 ltli idjobtitlegtSocial Media Internltligt                 ltli idsubheadgtJanuaryampndashAugust 12ltligt                 ltligt Established and managed companys Facebook and Twitter pagesltligt                 ltligt Created graphics for emails and promotionsltligt             ltulgt              lth4gtTCU Schieffer School of Journalismlth4gt             ltulgt                 ltli idjobtitlegtWebsite Assistantltligt                 ltli idsubheadgtAugust 09ampndashDecember 12ltligt                 ltligt Uploaded content onto the schools website through HTML and CSSltligt                 ltligt Managed the site by keeping it free of visual and typographical errorsltligt             ltulgt              lth4gtTCU Student Activitieslth4gt             ltulgt                 ltli idjobtitlegtGraphic Designerltligt                 ltli idsubheadgtSeptember 10ampndashDecember 12ltligt                 ltligt Designed posters for campuswide eventsltligt                 ltligt Created invitations and printed materials for special eventsltligt             ltulgt              lth4gtPeaceable Kingdom Retreat for Childrenlth4gt             ltulgt                 ltli idjobtitlegtSummer Staffltligt                 ltli idsubheadgtSummer 10ampndash11ltligt                 ltligt Facilitated activities for campers including highropes courses zip line and rock climbing and pool activitiesltligt                 ltligt Ensured a safe and fun environment for campers by being lifeguard, CPR and highropes certifiedltligt             ltulgt  lthr gt           lth2gtSKILLSlth2gt             ltul idskillsgt                 ltligt Advertisingltligt                 ltligt Copywritingeditingltligt                 ltligt Graphic Designltligt                 ltligt Photoshopltligt                 ltligt InDesignltligt                 ltligt Illustratorltligt                 ltligt Web Developmentltligt                 ltligt HTMLltligt                 ltligt CSSltligt                 ltligt jQueryltligt                 ltligt AudioVideo Editingltligt             ltulgt  lthr gt         lth2gtEDUCATIONlth2gt             lth4gtTexas Christian Universitylth4gt             ltulgt                 ltli idsubheadgtDecember 12ltligt                 ltligt BS Strategic Communicationltligt                 ltligt Music Minorltligt                 ltligt Studies in Italianltligt             ltulgt      ltdivgt ltdivgt  ltfootergt ltpgtampcopy 2013 Kyle Simmonds.

Negative 5647 pI have a mobile application CE running on a Motorola Symbol 3090 which should allow for scanning  of inventory items and changing their properties on our SQL server The table has existed on the server for years and now they want a way to use mobile devices to update.p  pHere is the problem I am facing which needs addressing.p  ol liOur warehouse is very large and spans over multiple locations so inevitably we have dead zones in the warehouse so having a constant connection is not possible. What I have proposed is a way to go in offline mode and have an up to date copy of our inventory on local device. This would allow all transactions to be found and recorded locally. When the device is returned to cradle or back to wifi it updates the database. With this proposal im not sure if SQL Replication is the best way to handle this type of application. li ol  pWas hoping some more experienced mobile device developers had any input into the design scheme. p  pI have only been developing on these types of systems Motorola symbol 3090 for about 2 months now and have no background knowledge in SQL Replication. I understand the basics of what replication is doing but that is about the extent of my knowledge on the subject.p

Not good, circular coding is a no no. p  pbut if I set it to what was originally there  self.topViewController  [storyboard instantiateViewControllerWithIdentifierFirstTop] lt btw first op is the title of the view used with the examplep  pIt works but then disregards the UIViewControllerp  pThis is why I asked if there was a way to identify the self.title of the UIViewControllersaid storyboard...my bad as I was going to put conditional logic around it in order to not put the code in if its on the UIViewController. p  pIt really is hard to explain unless you download the ECSlideViewController and start playing with it. But effectively I just want to test the self.title.....I think...p  pThe other idea was to bring the logic into the UIViewControllers of the four and get it to work there...but It freaks out passing nil as its expecting an identifier...p  pHope this makes sense....p  pJ.p

Negative 5647 pI really couldnt find anything useful. Im making my own Admin panel with Codeigniter and MySQL, and everything is done, except for the manytomany relations.p  pThe main table is Product table. I have 5 many to many relations Categories, Materials, Colors, Tags, Cities. There are 5 tables for each of them with these columns ID, and name of categorytagcity... and of course there are tables between that has both IDs of the Product and the other table.p  pAs first, I want to list all the products in one table, and in the columns I want to have column for categories, materials, tags, etc. and in the corresponding to cell, all the items to be listed with comma...p  pHere is how one row should look like.p  p ID  Name  Description  Category 1, Category 2, ...  Material 1, ...  Tag1, Tag2, Tag3, Tag4, ... p  pI hope you understood me. And next, hopefully, the Add function seems easy, but the Update function should be really tricky I guess, so any help for there is also appreciated, hot to solve it to be as fast as it can. I guess that first I should check for all the selected items to check if there is any new entry that is not in the linking table, and then to check if any of the unselected is in the linking table to delete it.

Negative 5647 pIm trying to use QtCreator as an IDE for Windows platform. So far I have managed to create a kit that uses cygwins gcc compiler, and to build a nonqt hello world project.  When I try to debug the project, I get p  blockquote   pThe debugger could not load the debugging helper library.p blockquote  perror and can see only assembler code. I have installed QtCreator as a standalone application, so I dont have either qt lib or mingw. If anybody knows how to make QtCreator debug projects using cygwins gdb, I would really appreciate it. p  pP.S The reason why I want to use QtCreator as an IDE is that Eclipses indexer fails on parsing boost sources, it eats up way too much memory and I have to turn it off to make the IDE operable. And neither autocomplete or navigation of the class hierarchy works without the indexer.p

Unfortunately, I did not notice this until after they have already wiped my old machine.  Again, I would expect that I need something in the Systems Environment Variables, but I am not sure what.p  pAny ideas  Suggestions on something to read that might help  The name of a good psychic to direct me in finding the answer  p  pThanks,p  pJamiep

Negative 5647 pI have a c program where Im creating multiple threads and having them access a shared array. p  pEverytime I want one thread to access the array, I callp  precodepthreadmutexlockampmutex codepre  paccess the array and then callp  precodepthreadmutexunlockampmutex codepre  pAll threads loop continuously until theyve accessed the array a certain number of times.  Thus they arent just accessing the array once, but instead accessing it several times.p  pNow, when I execute my program just as it is, whichever thread gets the mutex first usually the first thread created executes until it completes, before allowing another thread to access the array. p  pIf I add a simple sleep behind p  precodepthreadmutexunlockampmutex codepre  pThen the threads will alternate accessing the array which is what I want. I would rather not have to use sleep however to accomplish this.p  pTo the best of my knowledge I believe this is whats happeningp  precodeThread A locks the mutex and begins accessing the array Thread B tries to lock the mutex but finds its locked, therefore it waits Thread A finishes with the array and unlocks the mutex Thread A loops and relocks the mutex before Thread B realizes that Thread A unlocked the matrix codepre  pThus Thread A continues to access the array until its accessed it n times, then completes and Thread B accesses the array n timesp  pIs there anyway to make the threads waiting for the mutex to unlock to update faster and grab the lock as soon as its unlockedbr I would prefer the above output to be something more along the lines ofp  precodeThread A locks the mutex and begins accessing the array Thread B tries to lock the mutex but finds its locked, therefore it waits Thread A finishes with the array and unlocks the mutex Thread B sees the mutex is unlocked and locks it Thread A loops and tries to lock the mutex, but finds its locked, therefore it waits ... etc. codepre
Negative 5647 pI am currently working on a project dealing with responsive design, and the whole layout should be achieved using HTML and CSS.

It will be           the same one that you sent when initiating the purchase.                      WARNING Locally generating a random string when starting a purchase and            verifying it here might seem like a good approach, but this will fail in the            case where the user purchases an item on one device and then uses your app on            a different device, because on the other device you will not have access to the           random string you originally generated.                     So a good developer payload has these characteristics                      1. If two different users purchase an item, the payload is different between them,              so that one users purchase cant be replayed to another user.                      2. The payload must be such that you can verify it even when the app wasnt the              one who initiated the purchase flow so that items purchased by the user on               one device work on other devices owned by the user.                      Using your own server to store and verify developer payloads across app           installations is recommended.                    return true            Callback for when a purchase is finished     IabHelper.OnIabPurchaseFinishedListener mPurchaseFinishedListener  new IabHelper.OnIabPurchaseFinishedListener          public void onIabPurchaseFinishedIabResult result, Purchase purchase              ifresult.isFailure                  complainError purchasing   result                 return                           ifverifyDeveloperPayloadpurchase                  complainError purchasing.

Negative 5647 pI was wondering if there is any relatively simple way to essentially create an undo button that would undo whatever event happened right before it. The problem is, I cant do it explicitly for example, if the background was white, and then it became red, I cant just have the undo button reset the background as white. I cant do it this way because I wont know which event happened last, there could be a number of events that could have happened, and I dont want an individual undo button for every single event.p  pTo provide an example, I have a few labels in a grid, and when I mouse over any label it changes to a bigger size, and all the other labels become a standard smaller size. However, sometimes one of the labels will already be a bigger size from a button, or such  lets call this label1. So when I mouse over a different label  lets call this label2  then label2 becomes bigger whereas label1 is small now. But when I move the mouse off of label2, I want label1 to be big again whereas label2 should be small again. Thanks for any help strategies in advancep  pP.S. Im pretty new to WPF so the simpler the solution the better  But anything is appreciatedp  pEDIT I think an easy way of asking this is Is there any way to create a MouseLeave event that undoes whatever was done by a MouseEnter eventp

I also have autorefresh in the page so that the tableview updates the latest data on the first view. What is the correct way to do the autorefreshp  ol liSay the user has scrolled and loaded the next set of data. If autorefresh happens should i reload the table view. In this case, all the other set of data that i have scrolled will be replaced as am getting only the first page of tweets. Hope am clear on this.li ol  pNeed to know what is the best way of doing this in tableview.p  pThis is the flow  1. From server i use twitter API to get the first set of tweets, say 10 tweets.This is displayed in a table view.  2. When i scroll, i request the server for the next 10 tweets and then reload the tableview with that data.  3. The problem is that i have autorefresh for every 30 seconds for this page which requests the fresh set of 10 tweets. if i reload these 10 tweets, then the tweets that i had loaded when scrolling will be lost as am loading only the latest 10 tweets. Want to know what i should do so that i can prependreplace the latest tweets. p
Negative 5647 pI have a presentation to make to people who have almost no clue of how a GPU works. I think saying that a GPU has a thousand cores where a CPU only has four to eight of them is a nonsense. But I want to give my audience an element of comparison.p  pAfter a few months working with NVidias Kepler and AMDs GCN architectures, Im tempted to compare a emGPU coreem to a emCPUs SIMD ALUem I dont know if they have a name for that at Intel. strongIs it fair strong After all, when looking at an assembly level, those programming models have much in common at least with GCN, take a look at emp26em of the a hrefhttpdeveloper.amd.comwordpressmedia201212AMDSouthernIslandsInstructionSetArchitecture.pdf relnofollowISA manuala.p  pa hrefhttpwww.anandtech.comshow6355intelshaswellarchitecture8 relnofollowThis articlea states that an Haswell processor can do 32 singleprecision operations per cycle, but I suppose there is pipelining or other things happening to achieve that rate. strongIn NVidia parlance, how many emCudacoresem does this processor have strong I would say 8 per CPUcore for 32 bits operations, but this is just a guess based on the SIMD width.p  pOf course there is many other things to take into account when comparing CPU and GPU hardware, but this is not what Im trying to do. I just have to explain how the thing is working.p  pemPS All pointers to strongCPUstrong hardware documentations or CPUGPU presentations are greatly appreciated emp  pstrongEDITstrong Thanks for your answers, sadly I had to chose only one of them. I marked a hrefhttpstackoverflow.coma17432398748875Igors answera because it sticks the most to my initial question and gave me enough informations to justify why this comparison shouldnt be taken too far, but a hrefhttpstackoverflow.coma17428374748875CaptainObvious provided very good articlesa.p

Negative 5647 pId like to react on cursor keys for this I want to find out the escape sequences the current terminal is using in a canonical way.  Most solutions just have the strings codee[Acode etc. in the source code.  I understand that this is not portable in case the target system uses a different escape sequence.p  pI tried using codetputcode to get the proper escape sequence but codetput kcud1code returns a different escape sequence than what is used for the down arrow key It returns codeeOBcode but the key results in codee[Bcode.  But no capname given to tput results in this string the best I can manage is tput cud which returns e[p1dB from which stripping of all parameters then will finally be the wanted string. But that stripping of parameters also does not sound nice.p  pWhats the canonical way of finding out the proper escape sequence the arrow keys will produce when pressed  I would be happy about a solution using codetputcode or codecursescode or even a completely different approach.p

Negative 5647 pIm currently creating a website for comparing products. When someone does a search Ive written code that goes off and findsscrapes data for comparison.p  pCurrently what Im doing is having an ajax request for each company currently 6 companies, although this couldwill expand. The ajax request calls the php code which returns a json encoded array company, name, price, type, size. As each request completes Im using jquery to build the html block and then appending it to the page.p  pFirst Question Is it better to use PHP to build the HTML or jQueryp  pNow, Ive got this working OK. However, now Im getting to a point where Im starting to think about using jQuery to manipulate the results ie to sort and filter the results. p  pMy thought process is basically to append all incoming ajax requests into another jquery array which I can then manipulate later as needed.p  pSecond Question Is the above logic sound, or am I missing a far simpler way of going about itp  pOther Questions Overall is this the right way there might not necessarily be a right or wrong way, but is it the best way of going about it Is having multiple ajax requests going to make things die a horrible death the more users I get   p

Negative 5647 pFor our Windows Mobile solution we are using the OpenNETCF.WindowsCE.Suspend method to suspend the device after a period of time. This is instead of using the OS timeout HKLMSystemCurrentControlSetControlPowerTimeoutsBattSuspendTimeout. The reason for this is if the device is suspended by the OS or the power button is pressed to suspend the device then the device seems to wake up of its own accord however if the OpenNETCF.WindowsCE.Suspend method is used, then the device will remain asleep until the power button is used to wake it.p  pWould someone be able to confirm, either way, whether an OpenNETCF.WindowsCE.Suspend puts the device in the same state as the device sleeping of its own accord via the BattSuspendTimeoutp
Negative 5647 pIm using Devise in my Rails 3 app, and Ive implemented some guest user funcitonality as outlined a hrefhttpsgithub.complataformatecdevisewikiHowTo3aCreateaguestuser relnofollowherea. p  pThe issue Im having here is that my app relies on somewhat accurate geocoding using rails geocoder and geocoding Users by zip and so I dont want to use IP addresses. My solution is to have a landing page for guest users where they enter their zip code and a guest user record is created with that zip and geocoded lat and long. Keep in mind that these guest user records have not been created yet, not sure why they arent created until navigating away from the landing page. I tried to simply use a form submit that called the codecreateguestusercode method with codezipcode as a parameter, but this is a private method so I cant do that.p  precodeltpgt  To get started, either lt linkto Sign Up, newuserregistrationpath gt,      lt linkto Sign In, newusersessionpath gt or enter your zip code here if you want to look around first     ltbrgtltbrgt     lt formtagcontroller application, action createguestuser, method post do gt     lt textfieldtag zip gt     lt submittag Enter Zip, class btn gt     lt end gt ltpgt codepre  pFrom my reading I think its best to leave this method as private, so Im trying to figure out how to make this work.p  pAny thoughts on the best way to create this guest user using the Devise method as outlined in the link above but including zip as a param that is specified by the guest userp  pPlease let me know if I can clarify anything here, and thanks in advancep
Negative 5647 pI am relatively new to threads, and Im still learning best techniques and the C11 thread library. Right now Im in the middle of implementing a worker thread which infinitely loops, performing some work. Ideally, the main thread would want to stop the loop from time to time to sync with the information that the worker thread is producing, and then start it again. My idea initially was thisp  precode Code run by worker thread void thread      whilerun           Do lots of work        Code run by main thread void start      if  run  return     run  true      Start thread  void stop      if  run  return     run  false      Join thread   Somewhere else volatile bool run  false codepre  pI was not completely sure about this so I started researching, and I discovered that volatile is actually not required for synchronization and is in fact generally harmful. Also, I discovered a hrefhttpstackoverflow.coma24850091356926this answera, which describes a process nearly identical to the one I though about. In the answers comments however, this solution is described as broken, as volatile does not guarantee that different processor cores readily if ever communicate changes on the volatile values.p  pMy question is this then Should I use an atomic flag, or something else entirely What exactly is the property that is lacking in volatile and that is then provided by whatever construct is needed to solve my problem effectivelyp

Negative 5647 pIm trying to make a strongarticlestrong element editable by including the attribute codecontenteditablecode, which works fine. Im able to type new text and style it without additional JS.p  pMy problem is the native rich text editing, although is great for basic things like codeltbgtcode or codeltugtcode, breaks some of my default formatting. When I hit kbdenterkbd the text shifts down [wrapping the new line of text in a new codeltpgtcode tag], but then when I hit kbdbackspacekbd as if to add it back to original paragraph, the native editor wraps the text in a codeltspangtcode tag.p  pIf this were just the case, I could deal with unnecessary span tags, but unfortunately the native editor emalsoem adds inline styling to the span tag, pulling the styles from the outer codecontenteditablecode element, so the tag would now look like thisp  precodeltspan stylefontsize 1.5em lineheight 1.3emgt codepre  pThis presents a problem in itself when working with codeemcode units, as now the text within the codeltspangtcode increases in size 1.5 times, not to mention the messed up line height.

Negative 5647 pIt seems that the Python C API is not consistent with the const correctness of character arrays.  For example, a hrefhttpdocs.python.org2capiimport.htmlPyImportImportFrozenModule relnofollowPyImportImportFrozenModulea accepts a codecharcode, whereas a hrefhttpdocs.python.org2capiimport.htmlPyImportImportModule relnofollowPyImportImportModulea accepts a codeconst charcode. p  pThe implication of all this is that in my C application that I am writing with an embedded Python interpreter, I sometimes have to cast the string literal that I pass to a Python API call as just a codecharcode as opposed to codeconst charcode, and sometimes I dont.  For examplep  precodePyObject os  PyImportImportModuleos  Works without the constcast PyObject cwd  PyObjectCallMethodos, constcastltchargtgetcwd, NULL  Accepts char, not const char codepre  pIf I dont do the codeconstcastltchargtcode or codecharcode on the string literal, I get a compiler warning about casting string literals to codecharcode.  p  pHere are my questionsp  ol liIs there an advantagereason to having some of the functions not take a codeconst charcode andor why would the Python API not be consistent in this  My understanding is that if the function can take a string literal, it cannot change the codecharcode so the codeconstcode modifier would just be reinforcing this. I also believe that the codeconstcode distinction is not as important for C for which the API was written than it is in C correct me if I am wrong... my strength is python, not CC. Is the lack of const correctness of the Python API because its simply not as important in C  There is an a hrefhttpsmail.python.orgpipermailpythonlist2000May060658.html relnofollowold thread on the python mailing lista from 2000 asking the same question, but it didnt seem to go anywhere and it is implied the reason might be due to some compilers not supporting codeconstcode.  Since many functions now have codeconst charcode, this doesnt seem to apply anymoreli lipBecause my understanding of C is limited, I am unsure if I am going about casting string literals properly.  The way I see it, I can either one of the following I am currently doing the firstp  precode Method 1 Use constcastltchargt PyImportImportFrozenModuleconstcastltchargtmymodule   Method 2 Use char PyImportImportFrozenModulechar mymodule   Method 3 Use char array char mod[]  mymodule PyImportImportFrozenModulemod codepre  pWhich is the best method do usepli ol  hr  pstrongUpdatestrongp  pIt looks like the Python3 branch is slowly trying to fix the const correctness issue.  For example, the codePyImportImportFrozenModulecode function I use as an example above now takes a codeconst charcode in Python 3.4, but there are still functions that take only a codecharcode, such as a hrefhttpsdocs.python.org3.3capilong.htmlPyLongFromString relnofollowPyLongFromStringa.p

Negative 5647 pWeve got a few applications which is managed by a Mercurial repository. We build releases using Jenkins.p  pOnce Jenkins has built a release we release it and go on working with new features. However, we dont have a specific way of keeping track of which revision we release. We can certainly figure it out, but it takes a little work to get it done.p  pIf something goes wrong with any given release and wee need to find the release which fails, and theres a lot of backtracking required. We cant simply fix the bug in headtrunk of the repository, because we might have introduced new features. What we want is a way to quickly get the release we distributed, fix the bug there, and release it again.p  pIs there a best practise for this Would a good way be to have Jenkins to tag the revision it is doing its build onp

Negative 5647 pIm trying to create an advanced search form for a WordPress project Im working on atm. What I want is to offer the user the ability to filter search results on any taxonomy and any number of taxonomy terms in each taxonomy.p  pBasically a form with checkboxes for each taxonomy term which would end up with a URL like codessearchtermamptaxonomy1[]term1amptaxonomy1[]term2amptaonomy2[]term1amptaonomy2[]term2code which would then obviously do a search like codetaxonomy1  term1 OR term2 AND taxonomy2  term1 OR term2code.p  pIve googled quite a bit on this but cant seem to find any official information. Does WP support this by default It seems you can do codessearchtermamptaxonomy1termid,anothertermidamptaxonomy2termid,anothertermidcode but I dont understand what kind of form would generate such a URL If I use checkboxes Id need to name my field codetaxonomy[]code note the code[]code but WP doesnt seem to want this which imo is one of those really stupid things WP does.p  pHave any of you guys done something similar recently Or know what the default WP way of doing this isp  pIm also using Relevanssi, but it seems to be doing the same thing as WP does by default.

Negative 5647 pI have a Matlab imagesc plot that cant rescale its x axis correctly when the figure window size is changed. When the figure is generated the axis is correct, but when the x axis is increased the number of ticks increases and the xlabels loop back and repeat. This is undesirable behavior.p  pI would post pictures, but apparently Im not reputable enough. Youll have to do with my written description instead. Basically the xaxis labels of my figure go from 100 to 400 with 6 ticks, i.e [100 0 100 200 300 400]. When I drag the window wider, it goes from 100 to 400, loops back to 100 and up to 300 again, with 11 ticks, i.e [100 0 100 200 300 400 100 0 100 200 300].

Negative 5647 pI have an iOS app that uses the codeCLLocationManagercode to monitor regions and to get GPS updates. Most of the time, I want my app to continue tracking the cellphone when it goes in background or even when it gets killed, and it works well I can still see the small arrow in the status bar after my app gets killed. The problem is that I am not able to stop monitoring the regions and GPS updates after my app has been restarted by the Location Services.p  pWhen my app gets restarted by the Location Services, I instanciate the codeCLLocationManagercode and then call its methods codestopRangingBeaconsInRegioncode and codestopUpdatingLocationcode before setting its delegate to codenilcode and itself to codenilcode.p  pThanks to NSLogger, I can see that my callbacks are no longer called, but the small arrow in the status bar stays there and my app is the only one that I allowed to use the Location Services from the settings menu.p  pWhat did I miss Is there a way to know what still uses the Location Services in my appp

I suspect it is becausebr  all of my functions take at least one home made debug interface a structure I use to ease debugging which is quite large 1 or 2kBbr  some of my functions for example one that implements an initalization sequence for some hardware are too long i.e. make too much subfunction calls  p  pNote my C code is used in several applications, some being compiled with gcc, some with visual studio 2010, some with a C top layer.

Negative 5647 pI have a directed tree, and I would like to get its size. I have no information about its depth or distribution of nodes. There are two major obstaclesp  p1 The tree is very large billions of nodesp  p2 Edge traversal is expensive.p  pAre there statistical methods I can use to get an estimate of its size number of nodes quickly and with bounded error Unfortunately, googling just results in exactcount algorithms which would perform poorly given these restrictions.p  pstrongBonusstrongp  pIf I relax the constraint from tree to DAG directed acyclic graph, can I get both its size and number of unique paths E.g. for this DAG every edge points downp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.com9Iivq.png altenter image description herep  pThere are 19 nodes size and 23 paths 4 extra ones because the red edge gives 1 more path for its destination node and 3 more paths to the children of its destination nodep  pstrongThings Ive triedstrongp  pFor the tree case, I am thinking of something along the lines ofp  precodeamounts  [] def estimateHelpernode     amounts[node.depth].pushlennode.children     for each child in small random sample of node.children         estimateHelperchild def estimateroot     estimateHelperroot     reach  0     for j  lenamounts  1 j gt 0 j         avgChildrenPerNodeAtThisLevel  avgamounts[j]         reach  avgChildrenPerNodeAtThisLevel  avgChildrenPerNodeAtThisLevel  reach     return reach codepre  pIt essentially computes the reach at the deepest nodes of the tree, then propagates that back into the level above to find the reach at that level. It does that until it eventually finds the reach of the root of the tree. Im not sure if Im making any assumptions about a uniform distribution of nodes or not in the above algorithm. To reiterate, I dont know what kind of distribution a given tree will have.p  pAssuming it works, this also solves the paths for the DAG. Once you have all the paths, I am thinking of using the inverse of the birthday paradox to figure out how many unique nodes there are. Birthday paradox answers how many days paths do we need to choose until we hit a duplicate day with some probability given 365 unique days of the year. So we keep trying random paths days until we hit a duplicate node, we repeat that several times to find a probability for that event, and then we plug it into the birthday paradox to find the number of unique nodes unique days in the year. Note though, that the birthday paradox also makes an assumption of uniformity.p  pNone of this is very rigorous. What would be ideal is something that gives me an estimate with an error bound, and a paper that describes the algorithm with sufficient rigor. Any pointers in the right direction are very much appreciated.p
Negative 5647 pRecently in a interview I was explaining about a framework that i have worked on. I said that we created a inversion of control by providing extensiblity  using template method design pattern. I said this was an example of Inversion of Control where our framework was calling the methods implemented by the user of framework, to which interviewer said that a template method design pattern is not an example of IOC.

Negative 5647 pIm dabbling in some pathfinding systems right now A, but Im no where near experienced enough to fully grasp the concepts behind everything. So please forgive me if this post is riddled with ignorance, or false assumptions.p  pMy goal is to be able to have an object traverse multiple planes to reach a destination, with variable entrances to each level, and each level having different designs. imagine a cave system that has 8 entrances on top, and your goal is to reach 6 layers down... Some of the caves link up, and therefor paths can be shared, but others are isolated until a certain point.... etc etc. Also, the inter connectivity of paths can be altered on each level. I know there are some systems that can do this, but my goal is eventually bestfastest option, as well as the ability to do this calculation quickly a possibility of at least 80 different paths being calculated at any given timep  pAn example would be something like this img srchttpi.stack.imgur.comAC5cI.jpg altLayeredPlanes pathingp  pEvery layer is another level, or plane. The green is a path that is both up and down between layers. during the course of the instance, paths can be placed anywhere, and any divisions inside a layer can be removed but for the case of this instance, they are organized like thatp  pIts been fairly easy to implement A for some basic path finding on a single level eg, get from one position to a ladder going down. But trying to decide which ladder will lead to the ultimate goal is what is difficult.p  pMy initial thoughts were to do something more like a data structure linking the paths to each other on the same level, and do some sort of tree traversal to decide which ladder the the path finding should direct you to when you reach a certain level...but that got complicated quickly, seeing as levels can be altered at any given point.p  pLike i said, Im not certain how A actually works, or the basics behind it... but its the basic algorithm that most people have said will work for multilayered designs. p  pI know that it really depends on the engine, and the implementation of the algorithm, so Im not asking for specifics... but rather some pointers on the best way to approach the situation Should I find a working A implementation that has multilevel calculations built in, and change my level architecture to fit it Should I simply utilize a 2d A implementation, and create a path structure, to give the pathing instructions on each levelp  pIs there another approach to this style of design that would be more beneficial, and efficient taking into account the number of calculationspaths to find p  pThanksp
Negative 5647 pIn Microsoft Access I need to display a table with the headers down the left side, instead of being across the top.  So far Ive found a lot of people asking this sort of thing, but no good solutions.  I have found that Microsoft supplies a VBA function to do this Method 2 at a hrefhttpsupport.microsoft.comkb202176 relnofollowhttpsupport.microsoft.comkb202176ap  pThat function creates another table in the access database.  I will modify that so that instead of creating a new table, it either prints the table to the form calling the function or returns a table, depending on what Access is able to do.p  pCan the Record Source property be set to a function  I havent seen a way to do this so far. If thats not possible, in the FormLoad event, what commands could I use to manually create a datasheet providing the rows and columns in transformed order.p  pThank you for your advice.p

Negative 5647 pMy first ever question on stack overflow so please go easy.  I have a long running windows application that continually processes sql server commands.  I also have a web front end that users use occasionally use to update the same db.  Ive noticed that sometimes depending on what the windows application is processing at the time that if a user submits something to the db I receive out of memory exceptions on the server.  I realise I need to dig around a bit more and optimise the code.  However I cannot afford the server to go down and expect that in the future ill be allowing more and more users on the frontend.  What i really need is a system that will queue the users requests they are not time critical and process them when the db is ready.p  pIm using SQL 2012 express.p  pIs SQL Service Broker the best solution, ive also looked into MSMQ.p  pIf so can someone point me in the right direction for it would be appreciate.

Negative 5647 pI am building an Android app which lets the user to upload photos and share it with other users as well.

Negative 5647 pMy current project is based on Yocto Daisy, with custom layer declarations in one git repo and application code contained in another git repo. The application code lifecycle is somewhat separate from the custom layer lifecycle, so Id like to be able to capture that in the build.p  pTo that end, I have two recipes that extend coreimage myimage and myimagedev. I would like to have myimage always use a tagged version of application such as v0.1, v0.2, etc. I would like to have myimagedev always use application HEAD from git master.p  pI have written recipes application0.1.bb and applicationgit.bb, and tested them in isolation. They behave as expected  application0.1.bb gets tag 0.1, and applicationgit.bb gets master.p  pThe problem comes in when I try to instruct a particular image to use a specific version of application. I would have thought this would be as simple as adding codePREFERREDVERSIONapplication  0.1code and codePREFERREDVERSIONapplication  gitcode to my image recipes, but this gives me no love. The only places that codePREFERREDVERSIONcode seems to work is in layer.conf and machine.conf, which doesnt help me since both images are for the same logical machine.p  pSo this is my question  is there a way to declare a dependency on a particular version of a package from a Yocto imagep

Negative 5647 pI have a PHPbased game that currently works in your typical requestresponse fashion, generating and outputting pages. I wish to completely separate the presentation and game logic, so I am porting to be APIbased using a hrefhttpphalconphp.comen relnofollowPhalcona. This will also allow me to make a mobile app that can interact with the same code base.p  pIm new to the whole REST API thing so I am trying to follow the guidelines set forth in a hrefhttprads.stackoverflow.comamznclick0596529260 relnofollowRESTful Web Servicesa. It is my understanding that the API should work as followsp  precodePOST to v1users adds a new user. GET to v1users returns a list of existing users... and so on. codepre  pHowever, the client that is consuming my API via AJAX most likely should only issue higherlevel commands. For example, I dont want a savvy user making an API call that modifies their experience. Instead, data modification would be the side effect of a game action that takes place based on player input.p  pFor example, the client may say hey, attack this monster, at which point the server will verify that the player has enough energy, carry out the attack, add the gold and experience to the player, and return the result to the client. These actions are very transactional, with multiple conditions needing to be true and multiple results needing to occur in order for the action to be considered successful.p  pI picture this functioning somewhere along the lines ofp  precodev1attackplayer  with the id of the player being a post variable. v1work  with the amount of time being worked as a post variable. codepre  pHowever, this seems like it would fall under an RPC type of architecture, as defined in the book, which I understand as not the same. p  ul liHow do I handle this scenario li liAm I correct in thinking a REST API is appropriate for this It would seem the nature of me needing to call remote procedures is fundamentally against what Im reading REST is.li liAssuming I am approaching this with the wrong mindset  is there some other architecture better suited or should I simply continue with the way I mentioned seeing it workli ul  pAny advice on whether Im headed in the right direction and what I can do better would be very beneficial to me.p  pThank you.p

Negative 5647 pI have data in a MySQL database that looks something like thisp  precodename score  alice60 mary 55 ... codepre  pA name can appear many times in the list, but can also appear just once.

Negative 5647 pI have such a scenario at hand using C I need to use a parallel foreach on a list of objects Each object in this list is working like a data source, which is generating series of binary vector patterns like 0010100110. As each vector pattern is generated, I need to update the occurrence count of the current vector pattern on a shared ConcurrentDictionary. This ConcurrentDictionary acts like a histogram of specific binary patterns among ALL data sources. In a pseudocode it should work like thisp  precodeConcurrentDictionaryltBinaryPattern,intgt concDict  new ConcurrentDictionaryltBinaryPattern,intgt Parallel.Foreachvar dataSource in listOfDataSources       forint i0iltdataSource.OperationCounti                 BinaryPattern pattern  dataSource.GeneratePatterni            Add the pattern to concDict if it does not exist,            or increment the current value of it, in a threadsafe fashion among all           dataSource objects in parallel steps.        codepre  pI have read about TryAdd and TryUpdate methods of ConcurrentDictionary class in the documentation but I am not sure that I have clearly understood them. TryAdd obtains an access to the Dictionary for the current thread and looks for the existence of a specific key, a binary pattern in this case, and then if it does not exist, it creates its entry, sets its value to 1 as it is the first occurence of this pattern. TryUpdate gains acces to the dictionary for the current thread, looks whether the entry with the specified key has its current value equal to a known value, if it is so, updates it. By the way, TryGetValue checks whether a key exits in the dictionary and returns the current value, if it does.p  pNow I think of the following usage and wonder if it is a correct implementation of a threadsafe population of the ConcurrentDictionaryp  precodeConcurrentDictionaryltBinaryPattern,intgt concDict  new ConcurrentDictionaryltBinaryPattern,intgt Parallel.Foreachvar dataSource in listOfDataSources       forint i0iltdataSource.OperationCounti                 BinaryPattern pattern  dataSource.GeneratePatterni            whiletrue                         Look whether the pattern is in dictionary currently,              if it is, get its current value.              int currOccurenceOfPattern              bool isPatternInDict  concDict.TryGetValuepattern,out currOccurenceOfPattern               Not in dict, try to add.              ifisPatternInDict                                 If the pattern is not added in the meanwhile, add it to the dict.                   If added, then exit from the while loop.                   If not added, then skip this step and try updating again.                   ifTryAddpattern,1                         break                            The pattern is already in the dictionary.               Try to increment its current occurrence value instead.              else                                 If the patterns occurence value is not incremented by another thread                   in the meanwhile, update it. If this succeeds, then exit from the loop.                   If TryUpdate fails, then we see that the value has been updated                   by another thread in the meanwhile, we need to try our chances in the next                   step of the while loop.                                      int newValue  currOccurenceOfPattern  1                   ifTryUpdatepattern,newValue,currOccurenceOfPattern                        break                                  codepre  pI tried to firmly summarize my logic in the above code snippet in the comments. From what I gather from the documentation, a threadsafe updating scheme can be coded in this fashion, given the atomic TryXXX methods of the ConcurrentDictionary. Is this a correct approach to the problem How can this be improved or corrected if it is notp

Negative 5647 pThis is more of a higher level algorithmic question. Im working on a particle in cell simulation for plasma physics. Each particle has position and velocity both 2XNparticle sized arrays. I have thus far been doing simulations that conserve the particle number so the size of these arrays stays constant. I now want to be able to add and lose particles for instance when they exit the domain during the simulation. This will involve adding new particles to the array and removing entries for those that have exited. I am doing a literature survey right now, but I thought I can fish here too for any suggestions for efficient algorithms for this. I would like to avoid search operations as Nparticle is typically a very large number 108. I have seen a linked list based approach but that will probably require heavy restructuring of my existing code.p  pAre there suggestions for other ways of doing the following p  pAt the end of time stepp  pcheck which particles have left the domain remove these from the     particle list  inject a fixed number from the inlet resize the     particle arraysp  pThanksp  pSiddharthp

Negative 5647 pWeve been working with EWS Managed services for a while now, however we would like to transition over to using the RESTful API for Office 365.p  pIs it possible for an application to access all of our users data without their consent We have an inhouse application that we would like to get some O365Sharepoint data to our users. Using SSO isnt really an option, as we dont want to keep asking our users to give consent we assume they already give it. Specifically, we want access to calendars and mail.p  pAre these serviceapplication level accounts available in O365 yet I think I read a while ago that they are on the roadmap but I have not seen anything since.p  pWould it be best for us to continue using impersonation with EWS for now until it is ready For some reason, EWS is painfully slow when getting data, meanwhile our tests with O365 SSO are a great deal faster, but we do not want SSO.p  pApologies if this does not meet the requirements for SA questions.

Negative 5647 pIs there any way to use a codeSlider.GracePeriodcode from the GDK in a highfrequency live card I have the menu option send message, and after you tap it and input your message, Id like to display a sending message... alert dialog or something akin to it with a grace period slider. However, I havent had success getting the grace period slider to appear in a dialog i.e. using the same view that was being passed to codeDialog.setContentViewcode as the argument to codeSlider.fromcode, the live card menu activity, or anywhere else. Any ideasp  pThis most likely isnt related, but I did notice that Googles GDK reference mentions that a grace period slider animates during the given grace period in timeInMs. This sounds like an argument to a function or constructor, but if so I couldnt find one. Maybe grace period sliders dont work if you dont set thisp  pNote I am aware of a hrefhttpsstackoverflow.comquestions27414490usingslideronlivecardthisa existing question, but it hasnt been answered yet and it concerns a different kind of both slider and livecard, anyway, so another question seemed appropriate.p

Negative 5647 pSVG stacking is a technique for stuffing multiple SVG images like icons into a single file, to enable downloading sets of icons in a single HTTP request.  Its similar to a PNG sprite, except much easier to changemaintain.p  pThe SVG to display is selected using the codecode fragment identifier in the SVG url.  The technique is a hrefhttphofmannsven.com2013laboratorysvgstacking relnofollowstrongexplained herestronga.p  pWhile this technique is arguably on shaky grounds in terms of browser support, and Chrome doesnt support it all in CSS codebackgroundimagecode it works surprisingly well in most browsers if done using an codeltimggtcode tag.  It works in IE9, Chrome, and Firefox as an codeltimggtcode tag, so a fallback to PNG is only required if you need to support much older browsers like IE8.p  pExcept... Safari is a bit of a problem.  Even though Safari supports SVGs back to version 5 and below, SVG emstackingem just doesnt work in versions lt 7.1.  A blank space is displayed where the icon should be.p  pSo, as of now a fallback is probably necessary.  But how can we use feature detection to determine whether we need to fallback to PNG sprites or at least hide the SVG icon so that a blank space doesnt appear. p  pThe various articles discussing SVG stacks talk about providing fallback for browsers which dont support SVGs.  Essentially, the most common technique is to simply use Modernizer to detect if SVGs are supported, and if not, use PNGs, as a hrefhttpsgist.github.comhofmannsven6227428filecustomscriptjs relnofollowstrongdemonstrated herestronga.p  pBut as far as I can see, nobody is discussing the case where a browser DOES support SVGs, but emdoesntem support SVG stacking.  And as far as I know, at least Safari 5 thru 7.0 fall into that category these browsers support SVGs, but apparently dont support the codetargetcode pseudo selector that enables SVG stacking to work.p  pSo how can this condition be detected  Do we have to rely on user agent sniffing herep

Negative 5647 pIm using the a hrefhttpsgithub.comcaolanasync relnofollowasynca module on my Node server in order to loop through objects in my mongodb database, fire off requests to the Instagram API based on data within each object, and increment codeminTimestampcode on each iteration until codeendTimestampcode is reached.p  pThe code below works great except for one big issue. If I increment codeminTimestampcode by a hardcoded value codeminTimestamp  1000code everything runs great. However, when I change that one line of code to grab the latest codecreatedtimecode from the most recent response codeminTimestamp  images[0].createdtimecode my loop runs once for each event then stops. I get the correct incremented codeminTimestampcode logged to my console, but the value never seems to make it to the next loop.p  precode modules  var express         requireexpress.io var app             express var port            process.env.PORT  6060 var io              requiresocket.io.listenapp.listenport var request         requirerequest var Instagram       requireinstagramnodelib var mongoose        requiremongoose var async           requireasync var bodyParser      requirebodyparser var methodOverride  requiremethodoverride var db              require.configdb var Event           require.appmodelsevent   configuration  mongoose.connectdb.url  connect to our mongoDB database   get all datastuff of the body POST parameters app.usebodyParser.json  parse applicationjson  app.usebodyParser.json type applicationvnd.apijson    parse        applicationvnd.apijson as json app.usebodyParser.urlencoded extended true   parse applicationxwwwform urlencoded  app.usemethodOverrideXHTTPMethodOverride  override with the XHTTPMethod Override  header in the request. simulate DELETEPUT app.useexpress.staticdirname  public  set the static files location  publicimg  will be img for users  var baseUrl  httpsapi.instagram.comv1mediasearchlat var clientId  CLIENTID  Event.find, functionerr, events     async.eachSeriesevents, functionevent, seriesCallback     var name  event.event   var latitude  event.latitude   var longitude  event.longitude   var distance  event.radius   var minTimestamp  Math.floornew Dateevent.start.getTime1000   var endTimestamp  Math.floornew Dateevent.end.getTime1000    async.whilst     function   return minTimestamp lt Math.floorDate.now  1000 ampamp minTimestamp lt  endTimestamp ,       functionrequestFinishedCallback          console.logsending request to Instagram for   name   with mintimestamp   minTimestamp         requestbaseUrl  latitude  amplng  longitude  ampdistance  distance  ampmintimestamp  minTimestamp  ampclientid  clientId,           function error, response, body              if error                 console.logerror               return                           JSON object with all the info about the image             var imageJson  JSON.parsebody             var images  imageJson.data             var numImages  images.length             if numImages gt 0                console.lognumImages   images returned with starting time   images[numImages  1].createdtime   and ending time   images[0].createdtime                           async.eachSeriesimages, functionimage, imageFinishedCallback                 Save the new object to DB               Event.findOneAndUpdate  and [latitude latitude, radius distance] ,  push photos                  img image.images.standardresolution.url,                   link image.link,                   username image.user.username,                   profile image.user.profilepicture,                   text image.caption  image.caption.text  ,                   longitude image.location.longitude,                   latitude image.location.latitude                 ,                  safe true, upsert false ,                 functionerr, model                    console.logerr                                                 imageFinishedCallback             , functionerr                   if any of the image processing produced an error, err would equal that error                  if err                       One of the iterations produced an error.

Negative 5647 pI have asked this questions many times without getting too much help on it. So Im asking now if its possible to change the values in a scope to a controller in a view which you are not in. Lets say, Im in view 1 which is view1.html. The view has two buttons, button 1 and button 2. If I click on button 1 a new view will appear view2.html. it will a bold text field for example b test b. I want scope.test to be button1. When I click on button 2 I want the same view to open view2.html, but this time I want it to display button2 and not button1. In other words, it should be scope.test  button2. p  pThe reason why I want this is to avoid creating many html pages, since I will have many different values after a while. I have tried to show and hide different bold tags, but are never able to do it. As you probably guessed, Im a noob with Angular, but I never receive a straight forward answer which is working in practice even how much I try. So please help, show me a easy example where you create two html page and one js. files, and how I can go from the first html page to the second and still show different values depending on my choice in the first view.

Negative 5647 pWill this anti cheat technique work for a multiplayer game using private servers publicly unknown executablep  pWhen the client starts the game it will auto update itself daily using a launcher. The Servers will update themselves, too.  Unless there is a real patch, the update only consists of changes in the gameobjects memory layout, netcode, and shaders.  This is done using an automated system that auto generates and randomizes C classes.  Maybe it could also add fake objects to the hierarchy to make identifiyng objects harder. p  pThis way I hope to update the game faster than a cracker can and will reverse engineer, update and publishupdate a new cheat.p  pWill this work or can hackers somehow work around this mechanism  Will they do this work daily or can they automate it at some point What can I do to improve this systemp  pIt seems randomizing memory layout does not help in the long term because the layout can more or less easily be extracted by following function calls in the executable and extracting pointer offsets from that code. So to efficiently prevent this, the structure of calls and the code itself needs to be randomized also. p  pAre there good ways to do that Is that working at all against automated crackingp

Negative 5647 pI am a novice c programmer and Ive been trying to learn more about the language through reading multiple books about the language. There is a section in a book im currently reading that talks about how smart pointers have different strategy for using the custom deleter provided by the useri.e. unique pointer takes a custom deleter through its second template argument, while shared pointer takes it through a normal functionconstructor argument and I got really confused at this paragraph p  blockquote   pAlthough we dont know how the library types are implemented, we can   infer that sharedptr must access its deleter indirectly. That is the   deleter must be stored as a pointer or as a class that encapsulates a   pointer. We can be certain that sharedptr does not hold the deleter   as a direct member, because the type of the deleter isnt known until   run time. Indeed, we can change the type of the deleter in a given   sharedptr during that sharedptrs lifetime. We can construct a   sharedptr using a deleter of one type, and subsequently use reset to   give that same sharedptr a different type of deleter. In general, we   cannot have a member whose type changes at run time. Hence, the   deleter must be stored indirectly.p blockquote  pHere it states that the deleter type isnt known until run time, but I thought that all templates are resolved during compile time, so I can see the shared pointer class using something like codevoid delT pcode where del points to the deleter passed, and T is the value type of the object pointed to by the shared pointer. so isnt the type, in this case, known during compile time If someone can also provide me with their idea of how the shared pointer class implements their deleter pointer, in case mine is wrong which Im sure it is thanksp
Negative 5647 pCould anybody give me some help in my attempt to pull down the NBA.com tracking stats using a python script into a simple table  This would be an example of the area of stats from the site im having trouble with.p  pa hrefhttpstats.nba.comtrackingplayerdefense relnofollowhttpstats.nba.comtrackingplayerdefenseap  pNBA.com makes it a bit difficult to get direct access to their stats, instead opting to make it, i think, a java formatted table that wont all show at once.

Negative 5647 pI have a custom view, codeCustomViewcode, that can animate itself in response to an codeanimatecode messagep  precode in a view controller [self.customView animate] codepre  pInside code[CustomView animate]code, the logic is as followsp  precode voidanimate      for each subview          startFrame  subview.frame         endFrame  EndFrameFromStartFramestartFrame         subview.animation  AnimationLoopBetweenstartFrame, endFrame       codepre  psup This block is pseudocode.supp  pThat is to say, the codeanimatecode method examines the current frame of each subview and generates an animation ending frame for each subview which is essentially a frame which is a fixed ratio larger than the current frame. Then, it creates one animation per subview that varies the frame of its subview, alternating between the current or start frame and the end frame, calculated earlier.p  pThis method works very well in general. It allows codeCustomViewcode to animate properly regardless of how its superview positions and sizes it. p  pHowever, in a few cases, users of codeCustomViewcode that is, view controllers call codeanimatecode very early in their lifetime  so early, in fact, that Auto Layout has not yet made any constraint or layout passes. This means that codeanimatecode is called when all of codeCustomViewcodes subview frames are codeCGRectZerocode. As you can probably guess, this causes both the starting and ending values of the animations to be calculated incorrectly. p  pEven after the layout pass is complete, and the views model layers have the proper frames, the codeCustomViewcode instance is still not visible, because its subviews are happily animating from one zerorect to another. Not good.p  pemHow should I restructure this animation behavior to allow users of this class to call codeanimatecode at any time without negative repercussionsemp  hr  pHere are some possible answers Ive considered, and why they dont seem satisfactory to mep  ol lipIn any view controller that uses codeCustomViewcode, put off the call to codeanimatecode until codeviewDidLayoutSubviewscode.br This forces an unwieldy restriction on view controllers that use this view. pli lipIn codeCustomViewcodes codelayoutSubviewscode method, first call code[super layoutSubviews]code, then restart the animation if it was already running.br An interesting idea, but codeCustomViewcode has more than one level of subviews. Thus, even after code[super layoutSubviews]code, many of the views further down the view hierarchy will not yet have valid frames, meaning codeanimatecode will still misbehave.pli lipIn codeCustomViewcodes codelayoutSubviewscode method, first call code[super layoutSubviews]code, then manually layout any required views frames using code[ltviewgt layoutIfNeeded]code, before finally restarting the animation if it was already running.br This might actually work, but doesnt seem like a good idea. As much as possible, Id like to leave layout work to Auto Layout.pli ol

Negative 5647 pI am working on application whose details are as followsp  ol liIts 3 tier architecture. Web Tier ASP.Net MVC  Service Tier ASP.Net WebApi 2  Database TierMS SQL 2014.li liApplication will also have native mobile apps as clients which will consume Service tier.li liService Tier Web API uses individual usernamepassword in conjunction with OAuth for authentication and authorization.li liUser details are stored using ASP. Net Identity system. ASP. Net Identity database tables are in same database as that of application database.li liThere will be no direct calls from clients i.e. web or mobile apps to database and every request has to go via service layer.li liUsers of web client and mobile apps will be authenticated against asp.net identity database which is part of application database.li ol  pI have partially implemented above architecture however facing one challenge i.e. once user is authenticated, OAuth token will be issued from service layer which will be valid for one day. But how and where should I securely store this token in Web Client ASP.Net MVC app so that user needs to login only once in day and not for every single request that it makes. One option I can think of is once user is authenticated and token is received in web client then store it in inmemory session storage and use it for further requests. However down side of this is, it will reduce scalability of application and will require sticky sessions in load balanced environment. Is there any better way I can handle this situation Also want to validate above architecture if its correct architecture p
Negative 5647 pIm collecting data from users devices for analytics. Ive got some final static Strings representing event names e.g. strongbannerclickstrong. As the appropriate event occurs the event name gets stored in sqlite database, after which I periodically read them from DB into JsonObject and make HTTP request to send the collected data to our server, but sometimes we get corrupted event names strongbannerclckstrong instead of  strongbannerclickstrong, strongistrong is replaced with strongstrong in all such cases. This case happens rarely, but it worries me. So Id like to know how come constant string be corrupted, I cannot reproduce it myself. My only guess for now is that its a device specific issue.p

Negative 5647 pI have to implement a token based authentication.p  pUsers have a username and a password. I use the SHA512 method to encrypt the password before inserting it into the database. For retrieving data from the server, making queries and other simple actions, I need to know who is asking for the data and if this person is authenticated. I want to use a token. During the registration the server creates a token for the user and saves it in the Person table into the database, with username and encrypted password. Now, when a user wants to get some data from the server, he can use the token.p  pIs there a way in which the server can understand who the user is using token, or do I need to pass the username too How can I know when the token expires without adding a field in the Person tablep  pIm not sure I have understand the proper use of a token, and I have no idea on how implement it. I use php for implementing communications between the serverdatabase and an Android application.p

Negative 5647 pthis question is basically the same question I asked a few weeks ago... a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions29243183howtotapintomappingcontextprocessanontypehow to tap into mappingcontext.processAnonTypea... I marked the question as answered by mistake and since then have not been able to get any follow up. p  pBasically what I am trying to figure out is a location within the breeze pipeline that i can set a non entity objects prototype when the object is materialized from server results... when breeze processes results from the servers that are not entities, it ends up calling the method below of the helper codeMappingContextcode class... this method is as followsp  precodefunction processAnonTypemc, node       node is guaranteed to be an object by this point, i.e. not a scalar               var keyFn  mc.metadataStore.namingConvention.serverPropertyNameToClient     var result        objectForEachnode, function key, value          var newKey  keyFnkey         var nodeContext   nodeType anonProp, propertyName newKey          visitNodevalue, mc, nodeContext, result, newKey          return result  codepre  pup above the value of results is what the client ends up receiving from breeze... this is a perfect place that I could do what it is i want to do just because i have access to the final object results AND the codenode.typecode property... i basically want to parse the codenode.typecode property in order to figure out the prototype of the non entity object... unfortunately it does not appear codeprocessAnonTypecode is an interception point within the pipeline... in the previous question i asked, i was directed to look at a custom jsonresultsadapter... i did that but i dont think it will work simply because the jsonresultsadapter does not ever appear to be in the position of changing the value of results the final object returned... so even if i implement a custom codejsonresulsadaptercode and return new nodes, the value of results up above continues to be the same... can anyone please clue me in thank youp  pEDIT 1 I already tried using a custom jsonresultsadapter but this does NOT work for what I am SPECIFICALLY trying to do, UNLESS I am using a very old version of breeze unlikely or am missing something really obvious more likely... down below I have provided two snippets of breeze code that will hopefully help me explain my conclusion... the first snippet is the visitandmerge method of the mappingcontext towards the bottom of that method youll see a call made to jra.visitnode thats great it calls my custom jra implementation which returns a node property in the result such that the following line will use that node rather than the original one so far so good then at the end youll see that a call is made to processmeta that passes in my custom node ok fine but then if you look the processmeta code in my case the last else block ends up being invoked and a call is made to processanontype this is where the problem is at this point my custom node is discarded for purposes of creatinginstantiating the final object returned to the client I understand my custom node will be used to create properties for the final object but thats not what I am after... instead I need to manipulate the final object myself by setting its prototype as I mentioned previously, if you look at the processanontype method it creates a new object var result   and that object is returned to the client, NOT my custom node, which is inline with what the documentation says please see all the comments I left in the previous post... do you understand what my problem is I am probably missing something here really obvious can you please clue me in thanks againp  precode proto.visitAndMerge  function nodes, nodeContext      var query  this.query     var jra

Negative 5647 pAs the a hrefhttpsdocs.python.org3.5libraryre.htmlre.regex.searchdocumentationa stated, using coderegex.searchstring, pos, endposcode is not completely equivalent to slicing the string, i.e. coderegex.searchstring[posendpos]code.

Negative 5647 pEDIT2 Clarification The code ALREADY has refresh cache on miss logic. What Im trying to do is reducing the number of missed cache hits.p  pIm using Redis as a cache for an API. The idea is that when the API receives a call it first checks the cache and if the data isnt in cache the API will fetch it and cache it afterwards for next time.p  pAt the moment the configuration is the followingp  precodemaxmemory 50mb maxmemorypolicy allkeyslru codepre  pThat is, use at most 50mb memory, keep trying keys in there and when memory is full start by deleting the least recently used keys lru.p  pNow I want to introduce a second category of keys. For this second category Im going to set a certain expiry time. Now I would like to set up a mechanism such that when these keys expiry this mechanism kicks in and refreshes them and sets new expiry.p  pHow do I do thisp  pEDIT Some progress. It turns out that Redis has a pubsub messaging system which in particular can dispatch messages on event. One of them is expiring keys, which can be enabled as suchp  precodenotifykeyspaceevents Ex codepre  pI found this code can describes a blocking a hrefhttpsgist.github.comjobliz2596594 relnofollowpython process subscribing to Redis messaging systema. It can easily be changed to detect keys expiring and make a call to the API when a key expires, and the API will then refresh the key.p  precodedef workself, item     requests.gethttpapiurlqparam.formatparamitem[data] codepre  pSo this does precisely what I was asking about.p  pOften, this feels way too dangerous and out of control.

Negative 5647 pLong story short, I have a structure in my angularjs app which is basically the following 1. There is an authService that is in charge of requesting access tokens, and refresh tokens. 2. There is an authInterceptorService that adds the token to the header of the request, however, the tricky part is here this service depends on the authService, for generating a new access token using a refresh token in case the access token is expired and the request is 401en, which means there will ultimately be a circular dependency, when I use the httpProvider service to register the interceptorp  pauthService lt authInterceptorService lt http lt authServicep  pMy questions is how is it possible to get around this issue when your interceptor needs to be able to issue a new access token using the refresh token and REsend the requestp

So the math I did was 105 x 6 6 slides. This gave me 630 pixels. With the slide margins, it has a total of 4 pixels for the right and left together. So I did 4 x 6 which equals 24. Then added them together. 630  24  654 pixels. I thought my programming was off, but its the same either way. But for some odd reason it will only go on one line if the width is 671 pixels 17 greater. I tried a width of 110 pixels for each slide, but then the container following the same math had to have 20 extra pixels. So it changes over time so I cant just add 17 pixels randomly for my equation.p  pIm not sure whats going on. Thanks for any helpp

Negative 5647 pHope someone can help me with thisp  pI just upgraded from Sublime Text 2, to 3.

From my research, this has to do with the settingp  precode Preview file contents when clicking on a file in the side bar. Double  clicking or editing the preview will open the file and assign it a tab. previewonclick true, codepre  pAs the default states, it should just preview the file on single click, but it actually opens it.
