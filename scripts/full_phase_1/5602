Hourly employees are paid 15.00 per hour and commission based employees are paid  10 of the value of their sales figure. In the class you are required to appropriately  plan for a earnings method double earnings and ensure that the method must be implemented in  subclasses.  Create a HourlyEmployee class and a CommissionEmployee class that are derived from Employee. In each of these classes, create an overridden method named earnings.  Finally, you are required to test your classes using a client class and to  store the instances of employees into a LinkedList, using trycatch blocks where appropriate. codepre  pI have most of the

Positive 5602 pSo this is an assignment Im having trouble getting started with. Weve been going over Linked Lists, and while I feel I have an okay understanding of it, Im having trouble translating it to a program. p  pEssentially the program has to read in two spare matrices from files, print both matrices, compute and print the transpose of both matrices, and compute and print the matrix product of the two matrices.p  pReading in the matrices, and printing both matrices Im fine with.p  pThe issues Im mainly having are with the later part of the assignment, computing, transposing, and the product.p  pAppreciate any help the StackOverflow community can give. p  pAn aside for Design aspectp  pFor this assignment, we will represent only the nonzero entries in the sparse matrix using linked lists. Each nonzero element will be represented by a node. Each node will not only need to keep track of its value, but also its row number and column number. As each node is in exactly one row and one column it will appear in exactly two linked lists one linked list for the row and one linked list for the column. These row and column linked lists will be circularly linked not doubly linked. A head node will be needed for each column list and row list. The head nodes are similarly circularly linked lists one for the row head nodes and one for the column head nodes. A single head node will serve as the head node for both of these lists.p  pAnother aside for Implementation and Testingp  pThe strategy will involve implementing the following classesp  precodeclass Node  Node nextInRow Node nextInColumn   class HeadNode  Node  HeadNode getNext ValueNode getFirst void insertint position, ValueNode value ValueNode getint position   class ValueNode  Node  int row int column int value   class SparseMatrix  Node  void insertint row, int column, int value SparseMatrix transpose SparseMatrix productSparseMatrix sparseMatrix void print HeadNode getRowint position HeadNode getColumnint position int getint row, int col  codepre

Positive 5602 pIs there such data structurep  ol liThere is slow list data structure such codelinked listcode or codedata saved on diskcode.li liThere is relatively small array of pointers to some of the elements in the slow list, hopefully evenly distributed.li ol  pThen when you do search, you first check the array and then perform the normal search linked list search or binary search in case of disk data.p  pThis looks very similar to codejump searchcode, codesample searchcode and to codeskip listscode, but I think is different algorithm. p  pPlease note I am giving example with codelink listcode or file on disk, because they are slow structures.p
Positive 5602 pI am fairly new to Java and I need to make a linked list. I was told that I need to make a class called Node to store each element. Ive written the classp  precodepublic class Node      public T data     public Node next      public NodeT data, Node next              this.data  data         this.next  next           public Node getNext              return next          public T getData              return data       codepre  pHowever, I am not allowed to make a separate class, it has to be within the LinkedList class. I understand how to make an inner class of something like an imported iterator, but the Node is not imported. How would I do thisp
Positive 5602 pIve been learning how Linked Lists work,and started building an implementation in C to reinforce the concepts. It was going well until I made a function to remove all nodes. I figured out a solution which is the commented code but I cant seem to figure out why the other code didnt work. p  pThe Node object is an instance of a class that was created using new. Therefore delete is used to, well, delete it.p  pI thought it may have been related to deleting the object and reusing the pointer variable. Then I came across this a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions23621677whathappenstothepointeritselfafterdeleteWhat happens to a pointer itself after deletea  Ive been staring at it for a while trying to figure out what it could be, and nothing I have researched seems to be providing an answer. p  pI dont believe it is something with my implementation so far because the programs works as expected when replacing the code with the solution code. p  pThe code outputs every address, but it doesnt seem to actually delete the object. If I run the program in Windows, the program will actually lock and never leave the while loop. Not an infinite loop, it just gets stuck and the function never finishes. If I run it on C4Droid the program doesnt lock, but the nodes still exist after the function exits. p  pSo my question is, why doesnt the current code work Ignore the commented code. That is a working solution. Is there something simple Im overlooking with pointer variables Thank you in advance. p  precodevoid LinkedListdeleteAll  Node pCurrent  pHead  whilepCurrent     Node pNext  pCurrentgtpNext     stdcout ltlt pCurrent ltlt stdendl     delete pCurrent     pCurrent  nullptr     pCurrent  pNext    pHead  pHeadgtpNext   delete pCurrent   pCurrent  pHead   codepre  pNode class p  precodeclass  Node     public         Nodestring contentdatacontent         string getData             return data                  Node pNext  nullptr     private         string data      codepre  pLinkedList.hp  precode   LinkedList.h      Created on Oct 3, 2015        Author Anthony    ifndef LINKEDLISTH define LINKEDLISTH  includeltstringgt using stdstring  class LinkedList  public     LinkedList     virtual LinkedList     int length     void addNodestring nodeContent     void deleteNodestring nodeContent     void deleteAll private     class  Node     public         Nodestring contentdatacontent         string getData             return data                  Node pNext  nullptr     private         string data           Node pHead  nullptr    endif  LINKEDLISTH  codepre  pLinkedList.cppp  precode       LinkedList.cpp      Created on Oct 3, 2015        Author Anthony    include LinkedList.h include ltiostreamgt LinkedListLinkedList       TODO Autogenerated constructor stub    LinkedListLinkedList       TODO Autogenerated destructor stub   int LinkedListlength      Node current  pHead     int count  0     whilecurrent         count         current  currentgtpNext          return count   void LinkedListaddNodestdstring nodeContent      Node newNode  new NodenodeContent     newNodegtpNext  pHead     pHead  newNode   void LinkedListdeleteNodestdstring nodeContent    void LinkedListdeleteAll      Node pCurrent  pHead      whilepCurrent         Node pNext  pCurrentgtpNext         stdcout ltlt pCurrentgtpNext ltlt stdendl         delete pCurrent         pCurrent  nullptr         pCurrent  pNext        pHead  pHeadgtpNext       delete pCurrent       pCurrent  pHead       codepre  pmain.cppp  precode   main.cpp      Created on Oct 3, 2015        Author Anthony    includeltiostreamgt include LinkedList.h  int mainint argc, char argv      using namespace std      LinkedList list  LinkedList     list.addNodestringTest     list.addNodestringTest1      list.deleteAll     cout ltlt list.length ltlt endl      return 0  codepre

Negative 5602 pI have over the course of a few projects developed a pattern for creating immutable readonly objects and immutable object graphs. Immutable objects carry the benefit of being 100 thread safe and can therefore be reused across threads. In my work I very often use this pattern in Web applications for configuration settings and other objects that I load and cache in memory. Cached objects should always be immutable as you want to guarantee they are not unexpectedly changed.p  pNow, you can of course easily design immutable objects as in the following examplep  precodepublic class SampleElement    private Guid id   private string name    public SampleElementGuid id, string name        this.id  id     this.name  name       public Guid Id        get  return id        public string Name        get  return name      codepre  pThis is fine for simple classes  but for more complex classes I do not fancy the concept of passing all values through a constructor. Having setters on the properties is more desirable and your code constructing a new object gets easier to read. p  pSo how do you create immutable objects with settersp  pWell, in my pattern objects start out as being fully mutable until you freeze them with a single method call. Once an object is frozen it will stay immutable forever  it cannot be turned into a mutable object again. If you need a mutable version of the object, you simply clone it.p  pOk, now on to some code. I have in the following code snippets tried to boil the pattern down to its simplest form. The IElement is the base interface that all immutable objects must ultimately implement. p  precodepublic interface IElement  ICloneable    bool IsReadOnly  get    void MakeReadOnly  codepre  pThe Element class is the default implementation of the IElement interfacep  precodepublic abstract class Element  IElement    private bool immutable    public bool IsReadOnly        get  return immutable        public virtual void MakeReadOnly        immutable  true       protected virtual void FailIfImmutable        if immutable throw new ImmutableElementExceptionthis       ...  codepre  pLets refactor the SampleElement class above to implement the immutable object patternp  precodepublic class SampleElement  Element    private Guid id   private string name    public SampleElement     public Guid Id        get              return id           set            FailIfImmutable       id  value            public string Name        get              return name           set            FailIfImmutable       name  value          codepre  pYou can now change the Id property and the Name property as long as the object has not been marked as immutable by calling the MakeReadOnly method. Once it is immutable, calling a setter will yield an ImmutableElementException.p  pFinal note The full pattern is more complex than the code snippets shown here. It also contains support for collections of immutable objects and complete object graphs of immutable object graphs. The full pattern enables you to turn an entire object graph immutable by calling the MakeReadOnly method on the outermost object. Once you start creating larger object models using this pattern the risk of leaky objects increases. A leaky object is an object that fails to call the FailIfImmutable method before making a change to the object. To test for leaks I have also developed a generic leak detector class for use in unit tests. It uses reflection to test if all properties and methods throw the ImmutableElementException in the immutable state.  In other words TDD is used here.p  pI have grown to like this pattern a lot and find great benefits in it. So what I would like to know is if any of you are using similar patterns If yes, do you know of any good resources that document it I am essentially looking for potential improvements and for any standards that might already exist on this topic.p

Negative 5602 pI want to implement my own cursor in an OpenGL  GLUT window.

Negative 5602 pIm having problems coming up with an adequate restraint in SQL Server 2005. My problem involves the following tablesp  precodeTable PKTable    pk integer primary key,   property integer,   Table FKTable    pk integer primary key,   fk integer references PKTablepk,   codepre  pI really want to make it impossible for a record, fkrec, to exist when the PKTable record it references has property  5. The first thing I tried to do was create a schema bound view with the following query and create an unique index on the UniqueCol field.p  precodeSELECT     True AS UniqueCol, uh oh AS DiffCol FROM         FKTable INNER JOIN                       PKTable ON FKTable.fk  PKTable.pk WHERE      PKTable.property  5 UNION SELECT     True AS UniqueCol, default AS DiffCol codepre  pSo basically, the True, default record will always exist in the view, and when someone attempts to insert a row into FKTable and the PKTable record it references has property  5, I get a constraint violation because the first part of the union query above will return something. That was the idea anyway. But, SQL Server 2005 doesnt allow indices on views that involve a union. I then tried to create another viewp  precodeSELECT UniqueCol, DiffCol FROM TheViewAbove codepre  pPutting a unique index on UniqueCol fails in this case because you cant have indices on a view that reference another view. I knew it was a long shot. Any way to get around thisp  pThanksp

When the application is launched by an automated script in a non active users account the custom NSView does not draw any of the CALayers. I injected FScript into the app while it was not drawing the CALayer and noticed that the custom NSViews codelayercode did not contain any codesublayerscode Note that the layer setup code is contained in the codeawakeFromNibcode of the custom NSView.

Negative 5602 pI am working on a WPF application, using the MVVM Pattern.p  pEach ViewModel will need access to a security object, that essentially provides information about the rights the user has.  Because this object only needs to be populated once at start up, and because populating it is at least potentially expensive, I want to keep it in state for the lifetime of the application.p  pI can make it a static variable in App, which would make it available to the whole application at least thats my understanding.  This would make my ViewModel implementations very difficult to test, since the App.SecurityObject call would be inline in each ViewModel.  I would have to make sure App was available for each test and mock the App.SecurityObject call Im not even sure this would work, actually.p  pWe are using StructureMap, so I could create a SecurityObjectProvider and configure a it with a Singleton lifecycle in the container, and simply make it part of every ViewModel constructor.  The downside would be that as I said the provider would have to be part of every View Model constructor.p  pThere are other, hacky workarounds I can think of, but they would involve creating methods perhaps in the View Model base class that would allow injecting the security object after instantiation for testing purpose only.  I usually try to avoid this kind for testing only code.p  pIt seems like this would be a common problem , but I cant find any SO questions that are completely on point.p

Negative 5602 pIn a project Im working on, I have an object that is a sort of Collection with a database back end.  The exact results this Collection returns are dependent upon its configuration, which is itself dependent on a number of user inputs.  I would like to have an element on the page that contains the records in the Collection and can be updated dynamically through an AJAX request.  The idea has occurred to me to codeserializecode this object, store it in memcache, and include the memcache key as a parameter in my AJAX calls.  I would then retrieve the string from memcahce, codeunserializecode it, and retrieve the next set of records from the collection.p  pIs this a good way to achieve the kind of object persistence I want to make this work  I considered storing just the configuration, but I feel like this is a better set it and forget it solution in the face of future changes to the user controls.  My main concern is that there might be some pitfall with serialize that Im not aware of that would make this solution not robust, unreliable, or not very fast.  Do I need to be concerned in any of those regardsp

Negative 5602 pIts been a couple of decades since Ive done any programming. As a matter of fact the last time I programmed was in an MSDOS environment before Windows came out.

Consequently I want to run it in the fastest environment I can available to a general hobby programmer.p  pIll be using a 64 bit machine. Currently it is running Windows 7. Years ago a program ran much slower in the windows environment then then in MSDOS mode. My personal programming experience has been in Fortran, Pascal, Basic, and machine language for the 6800 Motorola series processors. Im basically willing to try anything. Ive fooled around with Ubuntu also. No objections to learning new. Just want to take advantage of speed. Id prefer to spend no money on this project. So Im looking for a free or very close to free compiler. Ive downloaded Microsoft Visual Studio C Express. But Ive got a feeling that the completed compiled code will have to be run in the Windows environment. Which Im sure slows the processing speed considerably.p  pSo Im looking for ideas or pointers to what is available.p  pThank you,p  pHave a Great Day Jimp

Negative 5602 pIm going to be running a large number of simulations producing a large amount of data that needs to be stored and accessed again later. Output data from my simulation program is written to text files one per simulation. I plan on writing a Python program that reads these text files and then stores the data in a format more convenient for analyzing later. After quite a bit of searching, I think Im suffering from information overload, so Im putting this question to stackoverflow for some advice. Here are the detailsp  pMy data will basically take the form of a multidimensional array where each entry will look something like thisp  pdata[ stringArg1, stringArg2, stringArg3, stringArg4, intArg1 ]  [ floatResult01, floatResult02, ..., floatResult12 ]p  pEach argument has roughly the following numbers of potential valuesp  pstringArg1 50p  pstringArg2 20p  pstringArg3 6p  pstringArg4 24p  pintArg1 10,000p  pNote, however, that the data set will be sparse. For example, for a given value of stringArg1, only about 16 values of stringArg2 will be filled in. Also, for a given combination of stringArg1, stringArg2 roughly 5000 values of intArg1 will be filled in. The 3rd and 4th string arguments are always completely filled.p  pSo, with these numbers my array will have roughly 50166245000  576,000,000 result lists.p  pIm looking for the best way to store this array such that I can save it and reopen it later to either add more data, update existing data, or query existing data for analysis. Thus far Ive looked into three different approachesp  p1. a relational databasep  p2. PyTablesp  p3. Python dictionary that uses tuples as the dictionary keys using pickle to save amp reloadp  pTheres one issue I run into in all three approaches, I always end up storing every tuple combination of stringArg1, stringArg2, stringArg3, stringArg4, intArg1, either as a field in a table, or as the keys in the Python dictionary. From my possibly naive point of view, it seems like this shouldnt be necessary. If these were all integer arguments then they would just form the address of each data entry in the array, and there wouldnt be any need to store all the potential address combinations in a separate field. For example, if I had a 2x2 array  [[100, 200] , [300, 400]] you would retrieve values by asking for the value at an address array[0][1]. You wouldnt need to store all the possible address tuples 0,0 0,1 1,0 1,1 somewhere else. So Im hoping to find a way around this.p  pWhat I would love to be able to do is define a table in PyTables, where cells in this first table contain other tables. For example, the toplevel tables would have two columns. Entries in the first column would be the possible values of stringArg1. Each entry in the second column would be a table. These subtables would then have two columns, the first being all the possible values of stringArg2, the second being another column of subsubtables...p  pThat kind of solution would be straightforward to browse and query particularly if I could use ViTables to browse the data. The problem is PyTables doesnt seem to support having the cells of one table contain other tables. So I seem to have hit a dead end there.p  pIve been reading up on data warehousing and the star schema approach, but it still seems like your fact table would need to contain tuples of every possible argument combination.p  pOkay, so thats pretty much where I am. Any and all advice would be very much appreciated. At this point Ive been searching around so much that my brain hurts. I figure its time to ask the experts. Thanks in advance to anyone and everyone who replies.p

Negative 5602 pThere is an ASP.NET 2.0 web site that I intend to migrate to a new web framework based on ASP.NET 4.0. While I know this involves manually preparing a scriptprogram to transform sites content from old applications database schema to the new one, I am more concerned about preserving the old URL formats mapping them to the new web engines URL format.p  pI have not yet decided what is the most appropriate CMS engine to migrate towards thus Web forms or MVC is still not clear. However, Id like to draw on everybodys experience onp  ul ligeneral issues to look out for regardless of web application platformli liemcandidate strategiestechniquesem to handle the URL remapping in ASP.NETli ul  pGoogle Analytics is already configured for the web site, so there is a history of the most requested links to study  which are the most important URL formats to remap and which are not worth preserving.p  pDue to work areas ive been diverted to the past few years, Ive not been able to keep up with the latest ASP.NET capabilities that can help with this. Oddly, I find little material discussing how to properly preserve old URLs most web sites are pretty nasty in totally discarding their old links when they perform a design overhaul.p  pMy first thought of the most straightforward technique is just to specify in web.config a custom 404 aspx page that will read the old requested URL which will carry the original content ID. Based on the content ID, look up a custom database table to find the new content ID, and redirect with the new URL.p  pAt this point I am unsure if Id want to make use of URL rewriting HttpModule or extension because Id only want to incur the lookup only when it becomes 404, rather than a check on each and every request. Knowing that old URL requests will eventually fade over time.p  pWhat other factorsaspects should I considerp

Negative 5602 pI am about to start planning a major refactoring of our codebase, and I would like to get some opinions and answers to some questions I have seen quite a few discussions on similar topics, such as a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions108141howdoiworkeffectivelywithverymessylegacycodehttpstackoverflow.comquestions108141howdoiworkeffectivelywithverymessylegacycodea,  a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions330220strategyforlargescalerefactoringStrategy for large scale refactoringa, but I have some specific questions at the bottomp  pWe develop a complex application. There are some 25 developers working the codebase. Total man years put into the product to date are roughly 150. The current codebase is a single project, built with ant. The high level goal of the project Im embarking on is to modularize the codebase into its various infrastructures and applicative components. There is currently no good separation between the various logical components, so its clear that any modularization effort will need to include some API definitions and serious untangling to enable the separation. Quality standards are low  there are almost no tests, and definitely no tests running as part of the build process.p  pAnother very important point is that this project needs to take place in parallel to active product development and versions being shipped to customers.p  pGoals of projectp  ul liallow reuse of components across different projectsli liseparate application from infrastructure, and allow them to evolve independentlyli liimprove testability by creating APIsli lisimplify developers dev env less code checked out and compiledli ul  pMy thoughts and questionsp  ol liWhat are your thoughts regarding the projects goals Anything you would changeli lido you have experience with such projects What would some recommendationsli liIm very concerned with the lack of tests  hence lack of control for me to know that the refactoring process is not breaking anything as i go. This is a catch 22, because one of the goals of this project is to make our code more testable...li liI was very influenced by Michael Feathers a hrefhttprads.stackoverflow.comamznclick0131177052 relnofollowWorking Effectively With Legacy Codea . According to it, a bottom up approach is the way to solve my problem  dont jump head first into the codebase and try to fix it, but rather start small by adding unit tests around new code for several months, and see how the code and team become much better, to an extent where abstractions will emerge, APIs will surface, etc, and essentially  the modularization will start happening by itself. Does anyone have experience with such a direction As seen in many other questions on this topic  the main problem here is managerial disbelief. how is testing class by class and spending a lot of time doing so gonna bring us to a stable system Its a nice theory which doesnt work in real life. Any tips on selling thisli ol
Negative 5602 pHey, a beginners question here.... In order to learn PHP and SQl I have set up a Localhost Server on my computer running Apache and phpmyadmin, using MAMP.p  pIn the course of testing, I have found that through the backend phpmyadmin interface I can modify the db as I please without any trouble. However, when I try to query the db through php scripts, no changes seem to be committed.p  pI say this because it seems that I am able to open a connection to phpmyadmin, evident by the error messages I receive when trying to pass a malformed query.p  pWhen I run these scripts, and then check the backend, I see no changes even though I received no errors. p  pMy best guess would be php is incorrect.

Negative 5602 pIm working on a drawing application similar to a 2d cad app in Linux and one of the first things I discovered while working with OpenGL is that my Intel I5 Core HD GMA built in graphics hardware does not support AA lines or Multisample AA methods. So, Ive spent the last week or so researching how to do antialiasing by using textures. I came across the arekkusu Invariance Texture AA article and have picked up quite a bit from it, but the problem Im having is that when I use a blended circle just like those in many examples, my lines come out as really wide ellipses. It does blend correctly and the ellipse looks great.  However, this isnt quite what Im looking for. It appears the texture is not being smeared horizontally but is instead being stretched instead. I wind up with an ellipse that is the height of the width of my line and an elleptical width about 12 the length of my line.p  pIn the mean time, Ive tried something slightly different and created a texture that is 1 pixel wide and X pixels in height. As expected, the height and varying alpha values do change the outcome of my lines but Im actually getting pretty good results except for very thin lines.p  pIm including the code for a small test application Im using GLUT app in hopes that someone can point out the boneheaded mistake Im making. It is using the above 1 pixel wide texture but obviously I want to replace this by a circular texture instead. It isnt intended to be the most efficient code, but is easy to play with until I can get everything worked out.p  precodeinclude ltGLglut.hgt include ltstdlib.hgt include ltstdio.hgt  float centerX  320.0 float centerY  240.0   GLuint textureId  0  static GLuint createTextureint width, int height      GLuint id glGenTextures 1, ampid   glBindTexture GLTEXTURE2D, id      int bpp  4   Bytes per pixel      GLubyte bitmap  new GLubyte[width  height  bpp]     for int y  0 y lt height y          printf03d ,y         for int x  0 x lt width x              if y  0  y  height  1                  bitmap[y  width  bpp  x  3]  21              else if y  1  y  height  2                  bitmap[y  width  bpp  x  3]  80              else if y  2  y  height  3                  bitmap[y  width  bpp  x  3]  166              else                  bitmap[y  width  bpp  x  3]  255                          printf03d , bitmap[y  width  bpp  x  3]               Fill color with white so we can blend in our              own color when we draw the line.             bitmap[y  width  bpp  x  0]  255             bitmap[y  width  bpp  x  1]  255             bitmap[y  width  bpp  x  2]  255                  printfn          glTexImage2DGLTEXTURE2D, 0, bpp, width, height, 0,                  GLRGBA, GLUNSIGNEDBYTE, bitmap      glTexParameterf GLTEXTURE2D, GLTEXTUREMINFILTER, GLLINEAR     glTexParameterf GLTEXTURE2D, GLTEXTUREMAGFILTER, GLLINEAR      glTexParameterf GLTEXTURE2D, GLTEXTUREWRAPS, GLCLAMPTOEDGE     glTexParameterf GLTEXTURE2D, GLTEXTUREWRAPT, GLCLAMPTOEDGE       Doesnt seem to make much difference for how this is currently        working.      gluBuild2DMipmaps GLTEXTURE2D, 4, width, height,                         GLRGBA, GLUNSIGNEDBYTE, bitmap      delete [] bitmap      return id   static void resizeint width, int height      glViewport0, 0, width, height     glMatrixModeGLPROJECTION     glLoadIdentity      glOrtho0,width,height,0,1.0,1.0     glMatrixModeGLMODELVIEW     glLoadIdentity       centerX  floatwidth  2.0     centerY  floatheight  2.0    static void drawLinefloat x0, float y0, float x1, float y1, float width      glBindTextureGLTEXTURE2D, textureId       Would be faster using arrays, but this is easier to tweak for now     glBeginGLQUADS         glTexCoord2f0.0, 0.0 glVertex2f x0, y0         glTexCoord2f0.0, 1.0 glVertex2fx0, y0  width         glTexCoord2f1.0, 1.0 glVertex2fx1, y1  width         glTexCoord2f1.0, 0.0 glVertex2fx1, y1     glEnd   static void displayvoid      glClearGLCOLORBUFFERBIT  GLDEPTHBUFFERBIT      forfloat angle  0.0 angle lt 360.0 angle  2.0          glPushMatrix         glTranslatefcenterX, centerY, 0.0         glRotatefangle, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0         glColor3f0.0, 0.3, 0.9         drawLine0.0, 0.0, centerY, 0.0, 5.0         glPopMatrix           glFlush      glutSwapBuffers   int mainint argc, char argv[]      glutInitampargc, argv     glutInitWindowSize640,480     glutInitWindowPosition10,10     glutInitDisplayModeGLUTRGB  GLUTDOUBLE  GLUTDEPTH      glutCreateWindowTexture Antialiasing       glutReshapeFuncresize     glutDisplayFuncdisplay      glClearColor1,1,1,1     glEnableGLBLEND     glEnableGLTEXTURE2D     glEnableGLCOLORMATERIAL     glBlendFuncGLSRCALPHA, GLONEMINUSSRCALPHA     glDisableGLDEPTHTEST     glDepthFuncGLLEQUAL       Create a texture 1 pixel wide by 8 pixels high.

Negative 5602 pI have noticed that our WebSphere is acting weird. It has been doing this since ever, so it is not due to topology changesp  ol lipIt appears When a server starts, it needs to have a ping to all other active computers in cell.pli lipIf theres another server that is still starting, the current server may decide to wait for it until it is finished.pli ol  pWe tried a few different things, for example it appears that putting the different servers in different core groups eliminates the problem.p  pI think this means that WebSphere expects the servers to be HighAvailable for each other, but they are not part of the same cluster, or have any applicative relationship between them.p  pIt appears that WebSphere wants to create a connection between every two servers in my cell.p  pIS this a known bug Is it fixed in later versions of 6.1 and 7p  pThank you.p

The problem is that all of the links I find in documentation dont point anywhere that lets me download .zips or .ppds. They just point me to more documentation that tells me about the modules. I think ActivePerl might have changed their site.p  pDoes anyone know where I can download thesep  pIve had no problems downloading and installing with the PPM tool on machines that do have an internet connection. Also, this is a possible solution, but I cant use CPAN Ive already created a minicpan and the MongoDB CPAN module only works with strawberry perl  I cant compile it with MSVC with cpan or manually.p

Negative 5602 pEDIT Using simpler code. I have a blackberry app that until recently I upgraded to 6.0.0.600 on my torch could be deleted. Now I cant even if I use javaloader u erase module in use and the UI context menu or physical menu has no option for delete. The code below just requires an app descriptor with an alternate entry point on startup with parameters startVibrate. The entry points code is below.p  precode   package mypackage  import net.rim.device.api.system.Alert import net.rim.device.api.system.ApplicationDescriptor import net.rim.device.api.system.ApplicationManager import net.rim.device.api.ui.container.MainScreen import net.rim.device.api.ui.UiApplication     This class extends the UiApplication class, providing a   graphical user interface.    public class ScheduleAppDemo extends UiApplication      public static void mainString[] args              if args  null ampamp args.length gt 0 ampamp startVibrate.equalsargs[0]                      scheduleVibrate                  else                      ScheduleAppDemo app  new ScheduleAppDemo             app.enterEventDispatcher                   public ScheduleAppDemo              ScheduleAppDemoScreen screen  new ScheduleAppDemoScreen         pushScreenscreen           public class ScheduleAppDemoScreen extends MainScreen              public ScheduleAppDemoScreen                      setTitleSchedule app demo                       private static void scheduleVibrate              Alert.startVibrate2550         ApplicationDescriptor current  ApplicationDescriptor.         currentApplicationDescriptor         current.setPowerOnBehaviorApplicationDescriptor.DONOTPOWERON         ApplicationManager manager  ApplicationManager.getApplicationManager         manager.scheduleApplicationcurrent, System.currentTimeMillis                   60000, true       codepre  pBasically what this shows you is that it vibrates every minute. Unfortunately evidence says it appears the Application Manager keeps the background process running during the time and then just calls it again when its time to run occurs again. This is the sample app from RIM. Deleting all Alternate Entry Points in the Application descriptor.xml allows the app to be deleted. Other than modifying that, reloading the cods, and then deleting it how can I delete the app.p
Negative 5602 pIm trying to securely bond an Android tablet to a beagle board for Bluetooth communications.  The goal is to bond both devices without any user interaction on the tablet GUI.  Ive found out of band OOB bonding to be what I want to user and have constructed code the basically works, but I am having some issues on the Android side that I didnt expect.p  pOn Android I am using supplied methods via reflection in the codeBluetoothDevicescode and codeBluetoothAdapercode classes.  This is fine because the app is custom and NOT targeted for the Android market or anything public.  These methods are not exposed through the public API and thus I find very little documentation about them.  p  pHopefully Ice Cream will have a real OOB API when it comes out, but for now I have to get this working with Honeycomb.  Ill describe what I have setup and then Ill ask questions I have based on the setup.p  pSo the beagle board is running the latest bluez stack, version 4.96.  I ran the a hrefhttpgit.kernel.orgpbluetoothbluez.gitablobftesttestoobh3340c00c758f8fa8e0f36c9f911e91950cf70229hbHEAD relnofollowtestooba example code that comes with the source and it worked perfectly.  No user interaction was needed for the bonding to complete with the exception of executing the script.  I accomplished this by using 2 USB bluetooth dongles on the beagle board and running the python script.p  pNow I figure I have a working example I should be able to bond to an Android tablet in a similar way.  I decided to use USB as the medium to transfer the OOB data securely as a physical connection would need to be made and there would be no issues on which devices I wanted to pair to.  I dont have any issues with exchanging data so I wont talk much more about this.  I will say that the beagle board is mounting the tablet and OOB data is writtenread tofrom uniquly named files.p  pIn the test OOB example code the following lines is basically the how OOB is performed.p  precodeoob0  oobadapter0.ReadLocalData  oob1  oobadapter1.ReadLocalData  oobadapter0.AddRemoteDataadapter1address, oob1[0], oob1[1] oobadapter1.AddRemoteDataadapter0address, oob0[0], oob0[1]  adapter0.CreatePairedDeviceadapter1address, testagentoob, DisplayYesNo, replyhandlercreatedevicereply, errorhandlercreatedeviceerror codepre  pI understand this code as each Bluetooth adapter has the OOB knowledge of the adapter it wants to pair to.  The bond is created and we are done.p  pSo to do this with Android basically codeoobadapter0code will add the Android data received via USB and within Android code the device adapter would set the beagle board OOB data.  p  pThe methods Im using in Android arep  precodereadOutOfBandData codepre  pThe above method gets the OOB data of the tablet bluetooth adapter.  This information is sent to the beagle board and set withing codeoobadapter0.AddRemoteDatacode along with the Android Bluetooth adapter MAC address.p  precodegetRemoteDeviceBeagle Board MAC Address codepre  pThe above method basically returns me a codeBluetoothDevicescode that points to the beagle board.p  precodesetDeviceOutOfBandDataBeagle Board OOB Data codepre  pThe above method sets the Out Of Band data for a remote device to be used during bondingpairing.  The returned Bluetooth device from the call to getRemoteDevice is used as the object.p  pI execute these methods and then signal the beagle board to start pairing.  The beagle board will then pair with the Android device, BUT on Android I get a pop up that says Devices XYZ wants to Pair and makes the user select Pair or Dont Pair  I did not expect this pop up and it is something Andoird is doing on its own.  I do not get anything on the beagle board as expected.  I feel like I duplicated the testoob script which produced no pop ups asking the user to confirm paring.  So Im not sure what the issue is.p  pI then thought well what if the tablet was the device that initiated the pair, but same issue occurs with the pop up on the tablet asking the same questions.p  pSo I played with my Android code more and after trial and error came to the realization that Android did not need to set any OOB data at all.  As long as the beagle board had the tablet OOB information the pairing would complete with no user interaction required. p  pWoot, I got my desired output but not in the way I understood OOB.  Also the codecreatePariedDevicecode call on the beagle board still returned pair failed, even though I am now paired.  Is the method expecting a call I am not doing  Also why does Android not need to know about the beagle board OOB information before pairing   p  pAlso when you navigate to the Bluetooth settings the beagle board is not listed as a paired device, BUT it is paired.  If I do a combination of turning Bluetooth off and then on and doing a scan for Bluetooth devices the paired beagle board will eventually show up as a paired device.  I can also see on the beagle board Bluetooth monitor that it is paired and communicating with the tablet.p  pI tried this the opposite way, Android knows about the beagle board OOB information and initiated the bonding process via codecreateBondOutOfBandcode, but the beagle board didnt know the Android tablet OOB information.  This case produces the result of a popup asking of I wanted to pair with the beagle board.  Thus it is the same as the case where OOB information is know on both sides and the beagle board initiated the pairing.p  pSo I feel something in my setup is not 100 correct and I am failing to understand why.  There is also not much information out there on how to properly do this.p  pI also played with the methodsp  precodesetTrustboolean and setPairingConfirmationboolean codepre  pBut they didnt seem to affect anything as I would get the popup or not based on the situations above.  Thus the popup didnt seem to be associated to the above methods.p  pI noticed there was a method namedp  precodesetRemoteOutOfBandData codepre  pBut I didnt see a use for it and really couldnt figure out what it was needed for.  How does this method differ from codesetDeviceOutOfBandDatacodeBeagle Board OOB Data outside of codesetRemoteOutOfBandDatacode not needing any augmentsp  pSo my questions arep  ol lipWhy does the popup display on the Android tablet asking if I want to pair, when I have duplicated the testoob script example.  I feel both devices know about each others OOB information and thus there shouldnt be a question asked by Aandroid on if I wanted to pair with the beagle board.pli lipWhy when I removed the beagle board information from the Android tablet code that pairing completes without any user interaction  To me this situation should be asking if I wanted to pair because the Android code has no information about the beagle board and should not accept it.  Granted the beagle board has the proper OOB information from the tablet, but it doesnt feel correct.  Maybe I just dont know enough about OOB and this is correct.p  ol liIf the situation is question 2 is expected and normal operation procedure, then why does the Android devices not know it is paired to the beagle board without needing to play with scanning for devices and turning Bluetooth off and then on  Is there another method I need to call to make it be seen that I dont know about Something just doesnt seem correct here.li olli ol

Negative 5602 pI have a Windows service that monitors several mailboxes for new mail. Once new mail arrives the service is responsible for determining what to do with it. It can either parse it and enter it into a database, ignore it, or forward it to someone if it doesnt recognize it.p  pI already have a working implementation ifwhen our email server goes down where the service will try and reconnect every emnem minutes until successful. The other problem is what happens ifwhen the database server goes down. Our service could very well still be running and parsing email but would stall if the database insertion fails.p  pHow do I handle the database going down Instead of having my service responsible for interacting to the database do I use a messaging framework like NServiceBus and send messages for each new item that needs to get added. Then this service would try and process it. If the processing fails for whatever reason most likely the database is down simply leave the item in the queue to process for laterp

Negative 5602 pIm really lost on this case. I am trying to apply a custom MVC framework to my web application. The confusion rises from organizing the SQL queries. OK, heres the casep  pcodeUserRepositorycode, codeThreadRepositorycode and codePostRepositorycode are all repositories that hold the SQL queries relevant to them. For instance, in the codeThreadRepositorycode I have the codegetThreadcode function which retrieves a thread from the database by its ID, in codeUserRepositorycode I have codegetUsercode function and so on...p  pHowever, say I am in the page that I have to retrieve a post, its thread and its submitter. When I apply the logic above, Ill have to call codegetUsercode, codegetThreadcode and codegetPostcode explicitly. If I was not using MVC, then I would probably create an SQL query like thisp  precodeSELECT  FROM user LEFT JOIN thread on userid  tuserid  Thread user id  user id  LEFT JOIN post on pthreadid  threadid  Post thread id  thread id  codepre  pAnd voila, I would retrieve all the required stuff in a single query. But in this case, even if I write such an SQL in which repository should I place it I mean, its awkward to see a code like the followingp  precodepr  new PostRepository user  prgtgetPostAlongItsThreadAndItsSubmitterpostid  codepre  pCmon look at this, first of all the code is not clear. Youll have to look to PostRepository to discover that the user is being retrieved from there, which is really not likely the first place youll look as a third person. Second of all, its not scalable. In future, as the application will grow Ill have to apply the same logic for, say, when retrieving the user statistics, or user friends, or user messages. Then it will be all complicated.  p  pOn the other hand, if I call the functions mentioned above e.g. codegetUsercode to retrieve a post, its thread and submitter separately, then it means that Ill have to sacrifice a lot from the performance since I am making at least three different mysql queries to retrieve some basic stuff that could be successfully managed by a simple join. Here I assume that 3 queries are slower than a simple join, thats what Ive read when I searchedp  pSo finally, what I really ask here is how to organize the business logic so that I can retrieve a post, the thread that it belongs and its submitter easily actually, this can be either hardly as far as it satisfies the options below while the process isp  ol liCrystal Clear for third party people e.g. other developers that will be recruited to the teamli liPerformance Wiseli liScalable li ol  pAll comments and opinion are highly appreciated. p  pP.S I know this is not a emwhat is thisem or emwhy is thisem question, but please, I really need help on this case so dont click on close just because its not a question that can be answered in a sentence. Please ask me to improve the question if necessary. p
Negative 5602 pFolks,p  pSummary why might Docmd.Rename on a table result in tables that dont change name over a Link from another DBp  pIm trying to fix up an old database that needs TLC. Part of this is deleting lots of unused cruft, amongst which are some tables. The first part if a VBA procedure that calls DoCmd.Rename on these tables, renaming with DELETE prepended.p  pThe deletes appear to work fine  but when I try to reference tables from another DB using the Linked Table manager, no renames have happened at all. If I go back and load that DB, the table names are changed.p  pIs it best to use TableDefs.Name to rename Is that a better method Id assumed an official way like Rename would be better.p  pIm using Access 2007 on Win764. The files are in MDB format.p  pThanks for any help,p  pRuthp

Negative 5602 pIm trying to configure my local development environment to read .less files so that I can edit .less files during development and only convert to .css when its time to go live. Make sensep  pIm running MAMP as my local testing server. Im following the instructions I found here a hrefhttpprogrammingperils.com155parselessfilesontheflyandservethemascsscomment920 relnofollowhttpprogrammingperils.com155parselessfilesontheflyandservethemascsscomment920ap  pIn short, the plan is to use an htaccess file catch requests to .css files and direct them to a PHP script which compiles the .less file of same name and returns the css code.p  pEverything seems to be working from the command line. I can compile a .less file from the command line and it spits out the css. I know my rewrite rule is working because I can type the url into a browser and see the output of my php script. For example, if my PHP script calls codeecho shellexecpwdcode I will see a path printed in the browser.p  pTHE PROBLEM is that I cant get the less script to run unless I SSH to the localhost as root. When I exit SSH and run the command I get Permission denied. I suspect this is what happens when my PHP script tries to call this... so its returning nothing.p  pI guess the question boils down to how can I get my PHP script to run the less compilerp  h1strongUPDATE I solved the problem...strongh1  pIt turns out that the less command codepathpathlessccode needed to be sudoed. PHP wasnt doing this, so the shellexec command wasnt returning anything. Thats why my echo statements DID work. p  pThere are a lot of ways to sidestep this, but I determined that editing the list of sudoers with codesudo visudocode was the best for my purposes. There was a lot of helpful tips on a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions3166123howtocallshellscriptfromphpthatrequiressudothis posta. Through trial and error, I figured out that PHP uses the wwwdata account. Adding this line fixed my problemp  precodewwwdata ALLALL NOPASSWD varrootnodenpmnodemoduleslessbinlessc codepre  pSomething to remember is that you STILL have to add sudo to the command that gets fed to shellexec.

However the navigation property TestChildren remains at NULL.p  pThis I guess is not sooo surprising since the model binding merely extracts the form values as they were sent from the browser and pushes them into an object of the TestParent class. Populating testParent.TestChildren however requires an immediate roundtrip to the database which is the responsibility of the Entity Framework. And EF probably doesnt get involved in the binding process.p  pI was however expecting the lazy loading to kick in when I call codetestParent.TestChildren.Firstcode. Instead that leads to an ArgumentNullException.p  pIs it necessary to tag an object in a special way after model binding so that the Entity Framework will do lazy loading How can I achieve thisp  pObviously I could manually retrieve the children with the second repository codetestChildRepositorycode. But that a doesnt feel right and b leads to problems with the way my repositories are set up each using their own DBContext  which is an issue that I havent managed to come to terms with yet.p

Negative 5602 pIve got a question about something I dont understand that is going on in my FPGA project.  I need to control two devices AGC and ADC through an SPI bus.  As as the FPGA will be the master device, Im generating a clock signal, strongSCKstrong, in code by dividing the system clock.  I then rout that signal to an output wire through a tristate buffer.  Below is my relevant bit of code.  Its not shown, but the signal that controls the tristate buffer, strongenSCKstrong controlled by a FSM, when it is set low in the idle state and then high for the rest of the states.p  precodeoutput wire SDI     for SCKclock reg SCKgen, SCKhold integer i reg enSCK wire negedgeSCK     SCKgenerator     always posedge clk             begin                 i lt i1                 SCKhold lt SCKgen                     ifi  10                         begin                             SCKgen lt SCKgen                             i lt 0                         end             end   assign SCK  enSCK  SCKgen  1bz codepre  pWhen I get implement the design i get the following warningp  pstrongWARNINGPhysDesignRules372  Gated clock. Clock net enSCKnot0001 is sourced    by a combinatorial pin. This is not good design practice. Use the CE pin to    control the loading of data into the flipflop.strongp  pAlso I notice my clock seems very distorted.  But if I dont use the tristate device in my code and direclty assign the clock signal to the output wire as in the code below I get a nice clean clock signal.p  precodeassign SCK  SCKgen codepre  pBelow is a side by side of the signal strongSCKstrong without the tristate buffer left and with the tristate buffer right.  Im fairly new to FPGA and Verilog, but my understanding is that using that style of assign code implies a tristate buffer, so Im confused why it seems to be interpreted as a gated clock source The XST generated schematic shows it implimented with an strongandstrong gate.  Im also confused about how its distorting the clock signal.  The FSM should be forcing the strongenSCKstrong enable signal high for many times the period of the clock so Im not sure whats happening. Also according to the demo board manual, other devices share this signal so I have to set it to high impedance when its not in use.  If someone could point me in the right direction, or explain it to me Id be very great full.  Thanks img srchttpi.stack.imgur.comJlzai.jpg altenter image description herep

Negative 5602 pI am looking for a way to hide one item in an Android spinner widget. This would allow you to simulate a spinner with no items selected, and ensures that the onItemSelected callback is always called for every item selected if the hidden item is the current one. Normally there is always one item in the spinner that doesnt generate a callback, namely the current one. p  pThere is some code on stackoverflow for how to disable gray out items, but not how to hide items completely as if they dont exist.p  pAfter much experimentation Ive come up with a somewhat hackish solution that works on various old and new Android platforms. It has some minor cosmetic drawbacks which are hard to notice. Id still like to hear of a more official solution, other than dont do that with a spinner. p  pThis always hides the first item in the spinner, but could fairly easily be extended to hide an arbitrary item or more than one item. Add a dummy item containing an empty string at the start of your list of spinner items. You may want to set the current spinner selection to item 0 before the spinner dialog opens, this will simulate an unselected spinner.p  pSpinner setup example with ArrayAdapter method overridep  precodeListltStringgt list  new ArrayListltStringgt list.add     Initial dummy entry list.addstring1 list.addstring2 list.addstring3   Populate the spinner using a customized ArrayAdapter that hides the first dummy entry ArrayAdapterltStringgt dataAdapter  new ArrayAdapterltStringgtthis, android.R.layout.simplespinneritem, list      Override     public View getDropDownViewint position, View convertView, ViewGroup parent              View v  null           If this is the initial dummy entry, make it hidden         if position  0              TextView tv  new TextViewgetContext             tv.setHeight0             tv.setVisibilityView.GONE             v  tv                  else               Pass convertView as null to prevent reuse of special case views             v  super.getDropDownViewposition, null, parent                    Hide scroll bar because it appears sometimes unnecessarily, this does not prevent scrolling          parent.setVerticalScrollBarEnabledfalse         return v        dataAdapter.setDropDownViewResourceandroid.R.layout.simplespinnerdropdownitem mySpinner.setAdapterdataAdapter codepre

Negative 5602 pI am making an GUI of a chess game. And i thought that i could run the chess game in a JPanel, and have some meny options in another. This way i could fit everything in one window. Is it possible to run a JPanel which runs another java class insidep  pEdit I mean running an entire java program inside of that JPanel, so the output of the chess program goes in to that JPanel inside my GUI program. Im not talking about a simple frame within a frame.p  pI am using lwjgl tools, which is a game developing tool. It runs its own window which i am trying to run inside a JPanel. I am familiar with border layouts etc, but i dont know if it is possible to run a external program within a JPanel. the chess game not extend JPanel, it extends BasicGame which is a part of Lightweight Java Game Library or ljgl.

Negative 5602 pHi I am having a strongtelerik GridViewstrong in my WPF application. In that grid i am having three columns like strongNumber, Maxstrong and strongMinstrong. Now I need to strongdisablestrong the strongMinstrong and strongMaxstrong Cells When i will give some value on the Number column for a selected row.p  pI declared two variables like strongMaxCellstrong and strongMinCellstrong as GridViewCellBase. If The QueryMentioned below for Getting MaxCell and MinCell will return null value, I am not able to give strongIsEnabledstrong as strongFalsestrong. Its not accepting any value . Its giving strongNull reference Exceptionstrong.     How can i solve this problem  can any Please tell me the solution of this problem Thanks in Advance. p  precode       foreach GridViewCell cell in row.Cells                        if cell.Column.Header.ToString  Number ampamp Convert.ToInt32  cell.Value gt 0                                GridViewCellBase MaxCell  new GridViewCellBase                  GridViewCellBase MinCellnew GridViewCellBase                  MaxCellfrom c in row.Cells                                     where c.Column.Name  Max                                     select c.FirstOrDefault                  MinCell from c in row.Cells                                      where c.Column.Name  Min                                      select c.FirstOrDefault                   MaxCell.IsEnabled  false Here I am getting the null reference  exception when MaxCell and MinCell having empty values                    MinCell.IsEnabled  false                   break                           codepre  pThe strongMaxCellstrong always returning empty value only. So i cant give the strongIsEnabledstrong property. Now my doubt is, Why the MaxCell value is always coming as empty or null value The cells are having the column like strongMaxstrong and strongMinstrong. Then it should return the strongActual Cellstrong but Why its always returning null valuep

Negative 5602 pIm working on an app using facebook amp oauth. The app lives inside a facebook canvas, and the authentication is done server side. The app is done w Ruby on Rails 3.2, using Koala for dealing with the api and mongodb as backend, for what its worth, and hosted on heroku.p  pSo, I supply the heroku url as redirecturl for the callback. Which makes the user go out of the canvas after the authentication, and well, I want it to stay inside. I read a few threads about this that suggested I redirect to the canvas url with js once the authentication is done. I did that, but now it seems that my session token is never set, and the user goes through the auth flow every time he tries to see a nonpublic page which means he loops on the welcome page, having an invisible exchange with facebook each time.p  pI dont really get what Im doing wrong here, so any help is welcome.

Negative 5602 pSo I am new to MVC and am working now with MVC3 and the Entity Framework. I am currently using a ModelSchema 1st approach as the database already exists. Therefore I create my ADO.NET Entity Data Model .edmx and I have all the needed entities in my MVC app. So far so good on all this.p  pHowever lets say one of my Entities is a Customer entity. I can see the autogenerated codepartialcode class inheriting from codeEntityObjectcode in MyEntites.Designer.cs. At this point I want to add some custom business logic to my MVC Model. Natuarally I believe the answer is to use my own codepartialcode class created in the Model named Customer as well.p  pI did a lot of searching on this before asking the question and see all kinds of information on POCO, T4 templates, modifying autogenerated code, etc and am lost. Is it a royal pain to add my own business logic and custom code to the autogenerated entities from EF I certainly dont want to modify the auto generated code over and over.p  pI need a straight forward explanation to make the proverbial light bulb go on, and then I can takeoff from there.

Negative 5602 pIn C11, how do you declare a function that takes a lambda expression as an argument  I can find plenty of resources online for declaring lambdas or taking them as template parameters, but what Id really like to do is be able to make use of lambdas as easytodeclare callback handlers, similar to whats made possible by closures in JavaScript and code blocks in ObjectiveC.p  pEssentially, the classic C construct I want to replace with a lambda is something likep  precodeclass MyCallback  public     virtual MyCallback      virtual void operatorint arg  0   void registerCallbackconst stdsharedptrltMyCallbackgt amp  void foovoid      int a, b, c     class LocalCallback public MyCallback          int a, b, c     public         LocalCallbackint a, int b, int c aa, bb, cc          void operatorint arg  stdcout ltlt abcarg ltlt stdendl           registerCallbackstdsharedptrltMyCallbackgtnew LocalCallbacka,b,c  codepre  pwhich would be simplified intop  precodevoid registerCallback WHAT GOES HERE   void foovoid      int a, b, c     registerCallback[]int argstdcout ltlt abcarg ltlt stdendl   codepre  pSo, what goes where I have written code WHAT GOES HERE codep  pEDIT This is for the purpose of storing a callback to be called back later, rather than for it being immediately consumed and called.p

Negative 5602 pI have written a server application that is currently running on a Ubuntu 12.04 x64 VM. The application connects to another server, sucks some data from this server, transforms it and then sends it back to client applications running elsewhere. All of this is over boostasio on top of TCP. IO is fairly heavy. p  pEvery day after a couple of hours or so of operation we see our server dropping the client connections. When the clients try to reconnect their connections are again dropped as soon as they are established. The error report by boostasio is Connection reset by peer. This goes on seemingly indefinitely. During this time I can ssh into the machine and the connection from our application to the server process is still healthy. Load is moderate. Restarting our application solves the problem.p  pAny ideas on how to further investigate this p
Negative 5602 pIn Java I use getterssetters when I have simple modelspojos. I find that the code becomes selfdocumenting when you do it this way. Calling getName will return a name, I dont need to care how its mapped to some database and so on.p  pProblems rise when using languages where getters and setters start feeling clunky, like in Python, and I often hear people saying that they are bad. For example some time a go I had a PHP project in which some of the data was just queried from the database and column values mapped to the objectsdictionaries. What I found out was that code like this was annoyingly hard to read, you cant really just read the code, you read the code, then you notice that the values are fetched from the database and now you have to look through the database schema all the time to understand it. When all you could do is just look at the class definition and knowing that there wont be any undocumented magic keys there.p  pSo my question is how do you guys document code without getters and settersp

I also tried setting tableveiw delegates amp datasources to nil amp fetchedresultscontroller delegates to nil before the faulting and setting them back to self again after loop but the effects are still the same.p  pNow im absolutely sure that its the heightForRowAtIndexPath thats causing the large memory consumption.

Negative 5602 pI have an activity that generates and displays a GridLayout of custom ImageButtons called MapCells Its a game map, surprise. The MapCells are randomly generated and contain some variables that relate to terrain type as well as looking different the image. What happens when I run my code is that I get my lovely random map, and when I click on the cells they should toast up their id on the screen a diagnostic aid as well as getting their stored variables and setTexting them to some TextViews in the same activity. How it actually works when I click on the MapCells is that they toast the unique id as expected and have their unique appearances, but the terrain values that display are of the last MapCell that was generated in all cases. I thought this was the result of my for loop creating all of the MapCells as the variable q visible in commented out code which I was just overwriting every loop, so I rewrote it to the code below, however, I am getting the same problem. Other questions I have looked at seemed to indicate that giving them the ids would solve this.

Negative 5602 pFirst of all, this is my first PHP store, so if I seem a bit daft, I apologize.p  pShort form How can I pass a set of values to codeSESSIONcode variables for a PHP shopping cart, without using a separate form for each item on a pagep  pHeres the situation. Im trying to create a store. The products on each page will be called from a MySQL database, and organized by cost. This is all working perfectly.p  pThe problem Im running into involves the item options. Some of these items, like ballcaps, Tshirts, and other assorted goods, will have multiple sizescolors. The way I have this organized now is that each entry in the MySQL table that matches the criteria is output into its own form, with options for size and color, if applicable. The issue Im having with this is that while I can apparently post these to another page, I cannot seem to assign them to a variable. p  pI would love to do away with the forms entirely, and use a hyperlink like this     Add to cart but Im not sure its an option, ad Id need to pass the values of the size and color on some items.p  pI know this has been done before, and often, but I cant seem to get Google to help me out here.

Negative 5602 pI am working with a windows app form where I want a button to call a web service, MakeANote. The web service requires information which is returned with the login along with a ticket. the LogOn call has some input parameters, 1 ref which i heard is both input and output, and some output parameters. BUT it also RETURNS an array of Information. This array is put into my variable, pubinfo as followsp  precodeWebservice.Information[] pubinfo  null initialize  pubinfo  myflo.LogOnusername, password, ref ticket, out settings, out users,out terms, out currentUser codepre  pso the type is a custom type Webservice.Information[]. Each Information element in the array has 3 properties emstring ID, string Name, and boolean ReversedRead.emp  pI was thinking that as this is filled in with the LogOn button and therefore encapsulated within the method calling it and  as i wanted to pass this info to the other web service, MakeANote, that I might do something like thisp  precode            for int i  0 i lt pubinfo.Length i                              objInfo  pubinfo[i]                 storePubInfoobjInfo                 MessageBox.ShowPubInfo stored, PubInfo               codepre  pand store the pubinfo array in another function which the MakeANote function will have to call to collect it separately. This seems very messy to me, but I also want to keep things simple as Im new to this all.p  pHow would the storing function look like Something as simple as this doesnt seem to work.p  precode       public void storePubInfo                   return storePubInfo         codepre  pIm fine with appending it as well. Is that better And is returning alright or do i actually have to have something like Webservice.Information storePubInfovarp  pWhen I click the button, my function to make a note is called with the argument of the ticket.. so the ticket gets passed without a problem. My question is the array thats being RETURNED with the logon, pubinfo.p  hr  pIm open for ideas if Im trying to do this the wrong way, or there is a better way of doing this. Should I do something utterly different and perform the extraction in the buttonclick Any good examples if sop
Negative 5602 pI do JSF development using Myfaces, Primefaces, Tomcat in Eclipse IDE. When testing thru I used to get exceptions thrown by MyfacesPrimefaces in the Eclipse Console.p  pRecently I enhanced my development environment by adding MyFaces CODI and OpenWebBeans.

Negative 5602 pI know that this particular topic was asked many times, but unfortunately in my case none of them are working. For past few days I was trying to get it to functional state, but I failed every time, so I finally come here to ask.p  pI have a webservice on server with selfsigned certificate. I can access wsdl file if I enter address into browser. Browser just remind me, that there is some issues with cert. and if I hit continue, everything works. Sadly I know very little about SSL, because its first time I made an application with SSL communication. In application Ill only get exception No peer certificate or Trust anchor path not found depends on type of solution I used.p  pI ran test on sslhopper.com and I get a warning that The certificate is not trusted in all web browsers. You may need to install an Intermediatechain certificate to link it to a trusted root certificate. Is this a serious issue in Android development or it could be resolved by some codep  pSo my question is actually, how can I do in application make hit the continue button or anything to make it actually connected to the server. In this case is it problem with certificate itself or am I doing something wrong on the application itselfp

Negative 5602 pI have a generator codegcode which I know in advance that would return codencode items. Each item codeicode is of the following structurep  pcodetiei, bicodep  pcodeticode is a tuple of variable size, and may contain any ordered subsequence of list code1,...,ncode. For example, for coden6code, codet11, 3, 4code, codet22, 4, 6code and so on.p  pcodeeicode is a number floatinteger, and codebicode is a boolean which is not really used here.p  pstrongI wonder what is the most efficient way to construct a coden x ncode matrix using numpy array using codegcode such thatstrongp  pEach row codeicode of the matrix corresponds to codetiei, bicode in a way that 1. the row elements in the matrix whose positions appear in codeticode should be set using codeeicode 2. other row elements are default to code0code.p  pSo for example, given that row code2code of a code8 x 8code matrix corresponds to item codet2e2, b2  2, 4, 613, Truecode, this row should be then set as code0, 13, 0, 13, 0, 13, 0, 0code. Notice that we are not using zeroindexing here for the numbers in codet2code or codeticode in general.p  pAn obvious way is to construct a coden x ncode matrix in advance, and then go through each item return by the generator, and set each row sequentially based on the item. But I feel there must be some more efficient way to do this given the power of Python and that of codenumpycode in particular.p
Negative 5602 pI have two UITextFields inside a static TableView in a Storyboard for loggin in. The first time go to the tableView via a modal segue, the TextFields are editable as they should be.

Even more strange this behavior is only with iOS 6.0. On iOS 5.0 everything is fine.p  pIve already added this in viewWillAppear TextField.userInteractionEnabled  YESp  pIve also commented out all of my viewDidLoad and viewWillAppearCode, but still no avail.p  pAny idea is welcome.p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comvt8Bd.png altenter image description herep  pEDIT after closing and restarting the app, I once again have one shot.

Negative 5602 pIm looking for a feature  wondering if it exists in some 3rd party plugin or something.  Basically what Im thinking of would be something you could set up that would be like a break point, only it doesnt stop execution.  Merely alters the appearance changes color maybe of the break point when that line of code is executed.  It could even use a counter, so you can see at any given moment how many times that line has been run.p  pBasically where it would come in handy is when you get an exception thrown in such a way that your stack trace is less than informative maybe error handling is handled in a separate thread, or maybe different packages have different optimization settings so not all are directly debuggable, you can then look and easily see which lines of code have executed, and very quickly narrow down the source of the exception.  Im aware that you can put a hitcount on regular break points, and you can just set the value really high to stop it from actually breaking at these points, but break point counters arent immediately visible, so you have to hover over them one by one to see where execution stopped.  This would provide an immediate trail leading right to the point where things went wrong  like following the missing dots to figure out where Pacman is.p  pIm just curious if anyones seen a plugin out there that can do this sort of thing or if Im just dreaming here.p

I could not find anything about lost bytes via google, any help would be appreciated.p  h2Codeh2  precodeusing System using System.Collections.Generic using System.Diagnostics using System.IO.Ports using System.Linq using System.Text using System.Threading.Tasks  namespace SerialTest      public static class SerialPortExtensions              public static byte ReadByteSerialthis SerialPort port                      int i  0             do                              i  port.ReadByte              while i lt 0  i gt 0xff             return bytei                   public static void WaitForPatternUshortthis SerialPort port, ushort pattern                      byte hi  0             byte lo  0              do                              lo  hi                 hi  port.ReadByteSerial              while hi  pattern gtgt 8 ampamp lo  pattern amp 0x00ff                    class Program              static void Mainstring[] args                      500000 8n1             SerialPort port  new SerialPortCOM3, 500000, Parity.None, 8, StopBits.One             port.Open             port.DiscardInBuffer             port.DiscardOutBuffer              Sync             port.WaitForPatternUshort0xaffe               byte hi  0             byte lo  0             int val              int n  0               Start Loop, the stream is already synced             while true                              Read 7 16bit values 14 Bytes                 for int i  0 i lt 7 i                                      lo  port.ReadByteSerial                     hi  port.ReadByteSerial                      val  hi ltlt 8  lo                     Debug.Assertval  0xaffe                                  Read two sync bytes                 lo  port.ReadByteSerial                 hi  port.ReadByteSerial                  val  hi ltlt 8  lo                 Debug.Assertval  0xaffe                  n                             codepre

It first evaluates the   inheritance list, if present. Each item in the inheritance list should   evaluate to a class object or class type which allows subclassing. The   classs suite is then executed in a new execution frame see section   Naming and binding, using a newly created local namespace and the   original global namespace. Usually, the suite contains only function   definitions. When the classs suite finishes execution, its execution   frame is discarded but its local namespace is saved. [4] A class   object is then created using the inheritance list for the base classes   and the saved local namespace for the attribute dictionary. The class   name is bound to this class object in the original local namespace.p blockquote  pSo I understand the behaviour but not the rationale behind making the scope not be lexical like everywhere else. It goes against Special cases arent special enough to break the rules. Why does codeclasscode behave differently than, say, codedefcodep  pIs this a practicality beats purity case If so, whats the justification I initially thought it might be an artefact of python 2.x, but as you can see above, the behaviour is also present in python 3.3.p

String retrievedValue  stringCapture.getValue codepre  pHowever, I get a runtime error when I try to use codegetValuecodep  precodejava.lang.AssertionError Nothing captured yet     at org.easymock.Capture.getValueCapture.java80     at com.example.Test.myTest...     .... codepre  pI wish I could have a codeStringcode variable within my test method but outside of the codeIAsnwercode closure and set that variables value inside of my codeIAnswer.answercode method. The problem is that the codeStringcode variable must be marked as codefinalcode in order to be accessible to the closure, which makes it unmodifiable and hence useless. Also, I do not wish to use a global just to solve this.p  pThe only workaround Ive thought of it to use my own class that has a String field, declare it as a codefinalcode variable outside of codeIAnswercode, set the captured value during codeanswercode and finally set this value into a field within my test method. Perhaps theres a better way to do this because using another class to extract a captured value, or even a global variable, seems ugly to me.p

Negative 5602 pIm building a fairly large cmstype application with Backbone and Knockout and Knockback ko  bb bridge library, and Im trying to figure out a good way to abstract permissions.

Negative 5602 pI need a robust product for creating PDF files out of web pages on a web server using a C API for ASP.NET WebFormsMVC. The product should support SVG and PATH tags in the markup as well as being able to render markup created via ajax calls that fire after the page is rendered. The following steps will give you a better understanding of what Im trying to accomplish.p  ol lipThe user clicks an Export To PDF button on a webpage. This sends a request to a generic handler an ashx file.pli lipThe generic handler validates the users credentials and security clearance and then passes the URL of a webpage that is to be rendered as a PDF file to a PDF generation tool this is where the C API comes into play.pli lipThe PDF generation tool saves the PDF file in a temporary folder on the server.pli lipThe temporary PDF is read into a byte array and sent to the response stream where the user can then download the file.pli lipIf the PDF generation tool supports it, it will return the PDF file to the users browser instead of saving to a temporary location on the server.pli ol  pIm currently using activePDFs WebGrabber tool to accomplish this, but its having issues rendering Kendo DataViz charts they use SVG and PATH tags.

Negative 5602 pBackground I have some results from clustering of biological data which shows the number of shared connections between clusters. What I am trying to accomplish is to reduce this list of pairwise relationships to unique sets of identifiers based on shared connections. The data format is straightforward, it has three columns that show 1 cluster ID emiem, 2 cluster ID emjem, and 3 the number of shared connections between emiem and emjem. A sample of the actual data is in the code below. p  pHere is the code I have so farp  precodeusrbinenv perl  use v5.10 use strict use warnings  my linkage  while my line  ltDATAgt      my i, j, score  split s, line     if exists linkagei ampamp not exists linkagej          push linkagei, j          elsif exists linkagej          push linkagej, i          else          linkagei  [j]        for my key sort keys linkage      say join t, key, join ,, linkagekey   DATA CL21    CL9     2628 CL36    CL33    2576 CL29    CL59    2384 CL65    CL36    2318 CL65    CL47    2151 CL32    CL17    2147 CL21    CL31    2136 CL23    CL17    2092 CL94    CL59    2091 CL16    CL11    2088 codepre  pThis producesp  precodeCL16    CL11 CL21    CL9,CL31 CL23    CL17 CL29    CL59 CL32    CL17 CL36    CL33,CL65 CL65    CL47 CL94    CL59 codepre  pThere are two issues here that I would like some assistanceadvice in solving. The first issue is that there are still duplicate entries in the second column i.e., CL17, which I would like to reduce. The second issue is that an identifier should be added to an existing grouping if it has been seen before, instead of starting a new group i.e., CL65. Note that I am not keeping the values in the output with this example, but you can see the input is sorted in descending order, so it makes sense to me to build up the groupings in this fashion based on what has been seen.p  pDesired outputp  precodeCL16,CL11 CL21,CL9,CL31 CL23,CL17,CL32 CL29,CL59,CL94 CL36,CL33,CL65,CL47 codepre  pI hope it is clear from this desired output that each line should be a unique set and the tab was added in the codeoutput above to make it easier to see the problems.

Just run the kendo menu initialization of the htmlp  precodedocument.readyfunction       navmenuUl.kendoMenu.show  codepre  pWhen you create a kendo menu, submenu items that expand to the right are not updated correctly when you hover over them and then leave. With the top level menus, when you move the mouse over the item, the item will receive the kstateborderdown and kstatehover while the pointer is over it because the menu has expanded to draw its children below.

Simple code would be great instead of sending to API you can just alert message [message is widgetName  widgetData  value in related textarea]p  pI share my code I wrote so far but I know its not even close to what I want. p  pThanks in advance p  precode       lthtmlgt    ltheadgt        lttitlegtA Yammer Applttitlegt        ltscript srchttpsassets.yammer.complatformyam.jsgtltscriptgt     ltscriptgt       yam.configappId appidforyammer     ltscriptgt  ltstyle typetextcssgt  .yammertext    margin 2px width 328px height 32px    .showhide      displaynone  ltstylegt  ltheadgt ltbodygt     ltscriptgt     function post          yam.getLoginStatus functionresponse              if response.authResponse                  yam.request                    url httpswww.yammer.comapiv1messages.json                   , method POST                   , data  body  Test yammer API  ED                   , success function msg  alertPost was Successful   msg                    , error function msg  alertPost was Unsuccessful...  msg                                                   else                  yam.login function response                    if response.authResponse                      yam.request                        url httpswww.yammer.comapiv1messages.json                       , method POST                       , data  body  Test yammer API  ED                       , success function msg  alertPost was Successful   msg                        , error function msg  alertPost was Unsuccessful...  msg                                                                                                                 ltscriptgt    ltscript typetextjavascriptgt   function post2a        alerta       ltscriptgt    ltscript typetextjavascriptgt function    content.focusfunction  this.animateheight 85px,, fast  buttonblock.slideDownfast return false   cancel.clickfunction  content.animateheight 30px,, fast  buttonblock.slideUpfast return false    ltscriptgt   ltscript srchttpajax.googleapis.comajaxlibsjquery1.3.2jquery.js typetextjavascriptgtltscriptgt ltscript typetextjavascriptgt  document.readyfunction          .slidingDiv.hide         .showhide.show      .showhide.clickfunction     .slidingDiv.slideToggle         ltscriptgt   lta href classshowhidegtYammerltagt ltdiv classslidingDivgt   ltform methodpost actiongt     lttextarea  idcontent classyammertextgtlttextareagt     ltdiv idbuttonblockgt       ltinput typesubmit idbutton value Share  onclickpost2thisgt       ltinput typesubmit idcancel value cancel gt     ltdivgt   ltformgt ltdivgt   ltbodygt lthtmlgt codepre

Negative 5602 pIm currently working on an a hrefhttprunway12.comprojectsXPlaneOculus relnofollowXPlane plugin to add support for the Oculus Rifta and Im having problems with using quaternions for rotation. Ive done this kind of thing before with rotation matrices, or Euler angles, but since quaternions seem to be the way to go now, Im taking the chance to learn them. Quaternions are also what the Oculus SDK seem to use natively so using them is the path of least resistance.p  pThe problem im trying to solve is where to position the camera so it is in the location of the pilots head as the plane itself changes its orientation in flight. It seems pretty straightforward to me. I have a vector that represents the relative position of the pilots head to the planes center of gravity, and i want to rotate around the planes emzem vector by emrollem degrees.p  pHeres the code i have right now. I think this is right but running this code yeilds a position thats too high... somewhere above the planes roof and moves around in kind of a circular pattern as the planes orientation changes.

Negative 5602 pI am trying to implement a small chat application where user can text chat with any one of the online users. My logic behind this is some thing like the followingp  precode Login first.   Fetch the users who are online from DB and show them as list of online users.   Click on the users, then another small window is opening for text chatting.   Create a formtwo hidden fields one is for sender id and another is for receiver id, one textarea and a button for submitting for this chatting.   Through jQuery, fill the value of receiver id.   By session id, fill the value of sender id.   After submitting the button, I call a page through ajax jquery which is responsible to insert and show the current data from DB. codepre  pMy code for the ajaxJquery is like   p  precodedocument.readyfunction         sendbtn.clickfunction             var receiverid  hidereceiverid.val             var senderid  hidesenderid.val             var messagebox  messagebox.val              .ajax                 typePOST,                 urlchathistory.phpreceiveridreceiveridampsenderidsenderidampmessagemessagebox,                 successfunctionresult                     history.htmlresult                                               messagebox.val               ltscriptgt codepre  pUp to this, its working fine.

Negative 5602 pI know this is an incredibly vague question, and it might not be a good question for programmers, since this is really a hardware related thing, but I guess some assemblymachinecode comes into play which would be appropriate for this site. p  pSo what Im wondering is imagine the 6502 processor. It has some registers, an instruction set, and access to a certain amount of memory. Then imagine that you have some LCD screen with an arbitrary resolution. How is it determined what is shown on this screen How is it determined which pixels at which position is given what color Does the screen always display, for instance, a pixel with the value in the accumulator of the 6502, and with x position stored in register x, and y position stored in y Or is it interpreted differently by every machine p  pSomeone wrote a JavaScript 6502 emulator, and the device displays a pixel with its value at some memory position starting with 200. So for instance p  precodeLDA 08  STA 200  codepre  pwould display a pinkish pixel at position x0, y0. p  precodeLDA 01 STA 205 codepre  pwould display a white pixel at position x5, y0. p  pIf you look at the NES, however, it has a dedicated PPU which displays certain pixels with a certain value at a certain area on the screen. p  pSo how does it work Is it interpreted differently by every machine i.e. Apple II, C64, NES, or is there some kind of consistency of how it is interpreted p  pAs a matter of fact, what would happen if a program compiled for an Apple II was somehow executed on a C64 The machine should be able to read the instructions, right p

Negative 5602 pstrongI understand that Places amp Activities are separate from MVP.strong PampA are for managing browser history, and MVP is an architectural pattern. But, obviously, they interleave and overlap in areas, and this question is about how they can work cohesively together, in unity.p  pI just read up on GWT Places amp Activites, and recommended MVP structure, and my head is spinning. I need someone to confirm I have the basic idea down.p  pA codePlaceHistoryHandlercode has both a codePlaceControllercode and codePlaceHistoryMappercode. When you enter a specific URL in a browser address bar, the codePlaceHistoryHandlercode uses its codePlaceHistoryMappercode to determine which codePlacecode it should pass to its codePlaceControllercode. The codePlaceControllercode, in turn, fires an appropriate codePlaceChangeEventcode onto the codeEventBuscode.p  pOne or more codeActivityManagercodes are listening on the bus for such codePlaceChangeEventcodes, and map those codePlacecodes to an codeActivitycode, which is supposed to be the strongPresenterstrong component in an MVP architecture.p  pThe returned, concrete codeActivitycode presenter should have a modelinjected view typically UiBinder that implements codeAcceptsOneWidgetcode. This codeAcceptsOneWidgetcode component is then started via codeActivitystart...code and GWT  automagically  presents its contents to the browser.p  pIs anything Ive said incorrect, misleading or misunderstood If so, please correct me. A lot of code is about to be written based on this understanding...p

But how can I get Spine.js to work with this use case A similar use case could be an online email client with thousands of emails.p  pFetching all the records from the server isnt a good idea, so I suppose a way of updating the records with AJAX on the fly would be the best option How can this be done with Spine.js, or do I have to write my own libraryp

Negative 5602 pThis might have been answered before, sorry if it has. I basically need to get the angle from origin to point. So lets say strongOrigin is 0, 0strong and my strongtarget point is 3, 0strong.p  pstrong3 Oclock  90 degreesstrongp  pstrong6 Oclock  180 degreesstrongp  pstrong9 Oclock  270 degreesstrongp  pstrong12 Oclock  0 degreesstrongp  hr  pSomehow, I gotta do some math magic, and find out that the angle is 90 degrees Top is 0. emThe origin can vary, so I need a method with two parameters, Origin, and TargetPoint, which returns double Angle in Degrees.emp  blockquote   pYea, I realize this looks short and nonconstructive, but I made the   question as simple and understandable as possible.

Negative 5602 pI know that boundary condition testing is a good thing to do in software testing. But in my opinion, I think testing textboxs max length with boundary condition testing is not a good idea.p  pFor example, I have a textbox which set the limit to 10 characters. Is it necessary to test with all below testsp  ol liInput a 5 char text and expect that it would pass.li liInput a 10 char text and expect the test would pass.li liInput an 11 char text and expect that they cannot do that.li ol  pemI tried to search about applying boundary condition testing on UI but I found very little information on it.emp

Negative 5602 pI actually solved this issue for myself but was wondering if anyone could explain why my fix works. I was styling a popup modal on a mobile site using the MoovWeb SDK and sass. The modal consists of a mask div, which is located immediately inside a container div, and the modal div itself, which was buried more deeply in the DOM. p  pmask stylingp  precodemodalMask   opacity .8   position absolute   displaynone   height100   width 100   zindex9990  codepre  pmodal stylingp  precode.mwpopupmodal     top 80px important   left 0 important   positionfixed   zindex9999   displaynone  codepre  pThis resulted in the mask sitting on top of the modal and the buttons inside the modal being untappable  their tap area was actually located around 3cm below where the button was appearing onscreen on the phone. However, on the desktop version of the site, this styling looked fine.p  pWhen I changed the positioning of the modal from fixed to absolute this fixed the problem, but Id like to understand why. Do fixed and absolutepositioned elements each work on their own zindex stackp
Negative 5602 pI currently have a winform application that relies relatively heavily on reading mouse click points. Its a video application that allows the user to click on incoming video feed from a webcam and draw lines on it and do other things. The important part for this question is the drawing lines a simple example is that if they click somewhere on the video feed, it instantly draws a horizontal line across the entire picture at the point of the mouse.p  pThis works flawlessly on 96dpi, but when windows scales to 125 zoom Control PanelAll Control Panel ItemsDisplay  Medium  125, which scales it to 120 dpi, it all goes to pot. Suddenly the application reads the mouse as being clicked much farther down the picture than it actually is. p  pAll Im doing is pulling the exact location of the mouse upon mouseclick. It is literally as simple asp  precode                using Graphics g  Graphics.FromImagetmpImage                              g.DrawLinenew PenlineColor, lineWidth,                            new Point0, e.Location.X, new PointtmpImage.Width,                            e.Location.Y              codepre  pIn 96dpi, it draws exactly at the mouse. At 120dpi, it draws quite a bit south of the mouse. This is a huge problem for me.p  pIs there any way that I can either make my application constantly run at 96dpi, or some other solution to cause my application to work appropriately under the circumstances of 120dpip  pThank youp

It works, but I have an ulterior problem the links in the page contained inside the iframe are appropriately changed so that they function properly. The effect is that one can navigate inside the iframe as if it were a browser tab. So, when a link on the page is clicked, the temporary file gets rewritten with the contents of the site the link points to. However, the page is not reloaded, and I gather it is because the browser retrives the cached page, and not the page from the browser. I tried refreshing the source of the iframe via JavaScipt and it functions, but there is delay, and the page loads twice  I dont want that. I have also tried doind it with codedocument.writecode in JavaScript on the iframe object, again with no success. p  pA last clarification the iframe should contain the whole HTML of the page, complete with the codelthtmlgtcode and codelthtmlgtcode tags I did think of creating a JSP page with a DIV perhaps, and injecting the content there, but thats not what I want either...p  pThank you in advancep
Negative 5602 pI have a working Ajax call and function that populates a datalist.  The datalist is used to select from a finite list an addition to an UL element on the page.  Once I add one from the datalist to the actual list, I want to remove that option from the datalist.  The brute force method Im using is to clear the datalist and repopulate it.p  precodefunction populatedatalistfromarraylistid, liststr      clearChildren listid      var arr  eval  liststr      for var i  0 i lt arr.length i          var opt  document.createElementoption         opt.innerHTML  arr[i]         opt.value  arr[i]         document.getElementByIdlistid.appendChildopt        function clearChildren parentid       var childArray  document.getElementById parentid .children     if  childArray.length gt 0           document.getElementById parentid .removeChild childArray[ 0 ]          clearChildren parentid        codepre  pIve verified that the codeliststrcode object is correct.  i.e., it contains only the options not already in the current list.  But after calling codepopulatedatalistfromarraycode with that new list, the datalist in the dropdown doesnt change.  Is this because the browser has essentially compiled all of the values that were there like it were a normal, browserbased autocomplete and doesnt forget the values that I want removedp

Negative 5602 pI was able to add a recipient to an envelope with a recipientId that was the HASH of the recipients email address 50a5ae9b6d8889c1fda3f140621b448b. However, I was not able to add tabs to that recipient. I was able to edit the recipient name and email address, so the system seems to be able to recognize the recipientId. It appears to be a problem with the recipientId in the URL since adding tabs is the only REST API call that uses the recipientId in the URL.p  pAfter more testing, I found that there is a limit of 32 characters to the length of the recipientId but you can still edit the recipient and assign a recipientId that is not valid alphanumeric andor greater than 32 characters.p

Negative 5602 pMy application uses multicast capability of UDP.p  pIn short I am using java and wish to transmit all data using a single multicast address and port. Although the multicast listeners will be logically divided into subgroups which can change in runtime and may not wish to process data that comes from outside of their group.p  pTo make this happen I have made the code so that all the running instances of application will join the same multicast group and port but will carefully observe the packets sender to determine if it belongs to their subgroup.p  pWarning minimum packet size for my application is 3000060000 bytesp  pWill reading every packet using MulticastSocket.receiveDatagramPacket and determining if its the required packet cause too much overhead even buffer overflow.p  pWould it generate massive traffic leading to congestion in the network because every packet is sent to everyone p
Negative 5602 pI have the following bit of code converting a path into a urip  precodeuri.appendString.formats, URLEncoder.encodegroupName, UTF8.name codepre  p...where groupName can contain codecode characters. By default, URLEncoder converts these to code2Fcodeand this doesnt work for me. My first thought is to take this approachp  precodeURLEncoder.encodegroupName, UTF8.name.replaceAll2F,  codepre  pBut that feels kind of hacky. Is there a more conventional way of accomplishing thisp
Negative 5602 pI have had a recurring problem which has continued to surface the past couple of years and Id like to finally resolve it. p  pSo I have an Android game which is a bit like Space Invaders enemies in a line move across the screen. The issue I have is with supporting different screen sizes with Surface View. Clearly the distance the enemy moves will be dependent on the screen size to keep the same difficulty level. So I have a ratio for width and height that I multiply everything by to make sure everything is drawn in the correct locations proportional to the screen size. Such as the following p  precodeposX  intGameScreen.wRatio  speed  0.5f  codepre  pThe obvious problem here is that posX is an int and I am casting a float since drawing a bitmap only takes int parameters. So what ends up happening, is that in some cases the position will be rounded up to the next int making the game faster than it should be. Or, in some cases posX is rounded to 0. p  pWhat would be the best approach to avoid this I can assume that always incrementing by the smallest I can  by 1  and then skipping increments for particular enemies on each update of the game loop. But, this would require a lot of changes to my code and I would like to hear what other suggestions there may be before I do that.p
Negative 5602 pI have a button and a label on my asp.net vb page and when the button is pressed I need a countdown timer to begin with 10 mins and update every seconds, 0959, 0958, 0957 etc.... I need the timer to continue to countdown despite any postbacks or temporarily redirecting to a different page.p  pSo far I have tried using Asp.Net Timers With Async triggersupdate panels but for the seconds to countdown this needs to do a 1 second postback and is going to be quite resource expensive when there are hundreds of users accessing the system. It currently writes the exact countdown time to a session variable which is then retrieved when the page is reloaded  This is a very ugly method but they only way I can get it to work.p  pstrongUpdate  I have found the solution to my problemstrongp  pUsing this great Javascript Countdown Script a hrefhttpscripts.hashemian.comjscountdown.js relnofollowhttpscripts.hashemian.comjscountdown.jsap  pstrongASPX Pagestrongp  precodeltaspLiteral runatserver IDjsTimeMarkergt       ltscript typetextjavascript srchttpscripts.hashemian.comjscountdown.jssgtltscriptgt     ltaspButton runatserver Text10 Mins IDbtn10Minsgt codepre  pstrongCode Behind Pagestrongp  precodeSub PageLoadsender As Object, e As EventArgs Handles Me.Load     If Not IsPostBack Then          Set Countdown Timer based on if Cookie is set         If Not Request.CookiesCountDownTimer Is Nothing Then             TimeMarkerRenderRequest.CookiesCountDownTimerData         End If     End If End Sub  Sub TimeMarkerRenderTargetDateTime As String     Dim sb As StringBuilder  New StringBuilder     sb.Appendltscript typetextjavascriptgt     sb.AppendTargetDate  08282013 181129     sb.AppendTargetDate   amp  amp TargetDateTime amp  amp      sb.AppendCountActive  true     sb.AppendCountStepper  1     sb.AppendLeadingZero  true     sb.AppendDisplayFormat  MS     sb.AppendFinishMessage  Finished     sb.Appendltscriptgt      jsTimeMarker.Text  sb.ToString End Sub  Protected Sub btn10MinsClicksender As Object, e As EventArgs Handles btn10Mins.Click     Response.CookiesCountDownTimerData  Now.AddMinutes10.ToStringMMddyyyy HHmmss     Response.RedirectRequest.RawUrl End Sub codepre

Negative 5602 pIf I declare a 2D arrayp  precodeint A[sz][sz] codepre  pHow can I create a pointer to this objectp  pI ask because I want to return an array via pointer to a pointer, codeintcode, from a function but I want to build the array without knowing the size beforehand. The size will be passed as an argument. I want to know if there is a way to do this without using dynamic allocation.p  pThe problem is if I do something like codeint Acode inside the function this gives codeAcode no information about the size I want. p  pHow can I create the array and then assign a pointer to this array, if its a 2D array.p  pI should be more clear. I want return a pointer to a pointer so it wouldnt be a pointer to the 2D array but a something like codeintcode.p

Negative 5602 pOkay so I am creating a django app and I have installed the south app in the INSTALLEDAPPS section in my settings.py. I have been using thep  precodepython manage.py schemamigration myapp auto python manage.py migrate testapp codepre  pcommands and they have been working perfectly until recently, made a change to my model.p  precodeclass Usersmodels.Model     days  1, 1, 2, 2,     day  models.CharFieldverbosename, maxlength1, defaultDay codepre  pnow, as you can see, I made two errors here. First is that I set the default to Day when it isnt even an option in the variable days. I also said that the maxlength1 and the default is 3 digits long. After running the schemamigration and migrate commands, it said gave an error sayingp  precodeDatabaseError value too long for type character varying2 codepre  pand then when I didp  precodepython manage.py runserver codepre  pit did give the choices except Day was not the default, the default was 1. I then added Day as the choices and I changed maxlength3 except now when I do p  precodepython manage.py schemamigration myapp auto python manage.py migrate myapp codepre  pit still is giving the DatabaseError. I tried it again and when I did the schemamigration command, it said that there were no changes made and then when I tried doing the migrate command, it still gives the database error. p  pI was thinking to run a SQL command form the command line to update the max length of days to 3 but when I viewed the database in PostgreSQL the database linked to my app it says that there is no days column created.p  pAnyone have an idea on how to fix thisp
Negative 5602 pIm running into a bit of a problem writing a LINQ Query.p  pGiven this datap  precodeObject       ID       Items                Object1       1       [1,2,4] Object2       2       [2] Object3       3       [2,4] Object4       4       [1] codepre  pI want to group on the IDS inside my codeItemscode propertyp  pThe end result should be something like thisp  precodeItemID     Objects       1          [Object1, Object2, Object3, Object4] 2          [Object1, Object2, Object3] 4          [Object1, Object3] codepre  pIn which Objects contains the entire object, or the properties that I wish to select.p  pAny help with this Its probably pretty basic, but I cant wrap my head around it right now.p
Negative 5602 pIm probably misunderstanding exactly how this works, but whats the best way to accomplish this I have something in mind but it seems quite hacky.p  pI have a set of sample data which I use to test my application. This is seeded via the built in seeder in Laravel. This contains things like example users, addresses, documents etc.p  pI also have a set of default data which should go in production. I currently add this directly in the migration. For example, if I was adding a table for accountroles, I might include the following at the bottom of the migrationp  precodeaccountadmin  arrayrole gt Account Administrator, flag gt ACCOUNTADMIN accountowner  arrayrole gt Account Administrator, flag gt ACCOUNTOWNER DBtableaccountrolesgtinsertaccountadmin DBtableaccountrolesgtinsertaccountowner codepre  pThis way, on production, I just migrate the database to insert any production ready database values, and on stagingdevelopment, I can refresh the migrations and then seed the database with sample data.p  pIs there any other better way to do thisp
Negative 5602 pI have an entity, lets say customer and this entity has 3 possible status strongactivestrong, stronginactivestrong and strongdeletedstrong.p  pThis 3 status handles 3 labels strongActivestrong, strongInactivestrong and strongDeletedstrong and they are used in the form, in the detail and maybe in a list so I we have a common arrayp  precodearray    active gt Active,    inactive gt Inactive,    deleted gt Deleted  codepre  pWhat I normally do is to handle this in a method called stronggetAcceptedStatusstrong that returns this values but then I figured out that I had to make something like thisp  precodeacceptedStatus  customergtgetAcceptedStatus echo acceptedStatus[customergtgetStatus] codepre  pAnd I do not find it good enough. How do you would you handle it Should I create a method that return directly the labelp

Negative 5602 pI am attempting to make a signature pad for a website that works by using the mouse or a touch screen device like an iPhone.  I was successful in getting the pad to work with a mouse but I am having some weird issues when it comes to using the touch screen on an iPhone.  The signature pad itself is all done client side by recording the move to, line to, and new line positions in 3 separate arrays and then building the line using an svg tag in a div segment while the user is drawing.  p  pThe issue I am having is that when using a touch screen everything works fine for the first line you draw but if you take your finger of the screen and the place it back on to draw a new line the system stops registering the movement of the users finger.  Here is the sample of the code.p  pJavascriptp  precodevar moved  Load Event Listeners function LoadList      document.getElementByIdSigCan.addEventListenertouchstart,functionee.preventDefaultTrackNow,false     document.getElementByIdSigCan.addEventListenertouchmove,functionee.preventDefaulttouchMovee,false     document.getElementByIdSigCan.addEventListenertouchend,functionee.preventDefaultStopTrack,false     document.getElementByIdSigCan.addEventListenertouchenter,functionee.preventDefaultTrackNow,false   function touchMovee     e.preventDefault     var sigobj  e.changedTouches[0]     var length     length  length  1      alertlength     getMouseXYe.changedTouches[0]    Set value to isSig to true mainly for mouse movement to track when button is pressed down function TrackNow document.getElementByIdltisSig.ClientIdgt.value  True     Set new line flag and reset moved flag.

probably be easier but I need to have it work by mouse on computers that are running ie8 and on touch screens.  So far I havent been able to find the fix but I have narrowed down the issue to this line of code codedocument.getElementByIdSigCan.innerHTML  inhtmlcode  If I comment out this piece of code everything works fine but that is the code that puts the svg path into the div segment so I need it.br The only other thing I have found is that when this error is happening it appears that the touchend event doesnt run after the first line is drawn for some reason I have to double tap the screen to get the touchend to register.  It gets to the point that when it stops responding I can press the screen again and it records it as another touch point.  I am very new to touch screen and am only an amateur when it comes to javascript so I was wondering if anyone could help.  p  pThanks p  pstrongEdit 1strong  I havent found a fix yet but I did find out what is actually happening.  For some reason when you remove your finger from the touch screen and then put it back on the touchmove event only fires once and never fires again no matter where you move the finger.  For some reason if you take your finger off the screen while this is happening the touchend event doesnt run but it will run if you tap the screen in the target area.p

Negative 5602 pWhen my view view A loads, a UITextField becomes the first responder. I can then push a new view controller view B, but when I pop that view controller back to view A, the UITextfield doesnt become the first responder anymore. I have to touch the textfield so that the keyboard will pop up. Im using XIBs if that helps.p  pI tried setting the first responder in the viewDidLayoutSubviews method, or the viewWillLayoutSubviews but still nothing. I even used an NSNotification to detect if view B has been dismissed and then pop up the keyboard but nothing. I have no idea what else to do. Its like view A is completely dead.p  pAny suggestionsp
Negative 5602 pstrongEDIT I have Found the answer to my own question. Please look at the bottom of my post.strongp  pI am having an animation issue trying to push a codeUIViewControllercode in codedidSelectRowAtIndexPathcode on a codeUITableViewcode programmatically. When I run this code in iOS 6 it works fine. In iOS 7 the animation is messed up it animates to the left about 20 of the screen then disappears. If I do this in storyboard the animation is fine. Am I missing something or is there a way around this without using storyboardp  precode This is a cut down example.  voidtableViewUITableView tableView didSelectRowAtIndexPathNSIndexPath indexPath      UIViewController viewController  [[UIViewController alloc] init]     [self.navigationController pushViewControllerviewController animatedYES]  codepre  pThis is what it looks like right before the tableView disappears. I understand why it does this. Its because the new view being pushed should animate sliding in over it as it does when using storyboard.

Negative 5602 pI am having a really tough time with structuring a Class that is used throughout the application. The problem is the exact same issue as described here a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions11660964sitecoreswitchesusersessionwithanotheruserSitecore switches user session with another userap  pA session variable is being shared by any secondary user that logs in AFTER the first user. My Class basically assigns a permission level to the session object, so that each page and or control can read it without doing a trip to the DB.p  pThe Class Structure is as followsp  precodePublic NotInheritable Class cPermissions     Public Shared Sub AssignPermissionToSessionByVal UserID As Integer     Private Shared Sub SetInSessionkey As String, value As DictionaryOf String, String     Public Shared Function HasPermByVal ControlName As String as Boolean End Class codepre  pSo to explain the process User Logs in. The login code calls cPermissions.AssignPermissionToSessionUserID. That Sub calls SetInSession which assigns the permission dictionary to a session object.p  pAs a sidenote, I would prefer a NotInheritable class in this instance as it allows me to shorthand through the code, using the Shared Function HasPerm without instantiating the class. HasPerm reads the session object and returns true or false if the control has permission or not.p  pSo back to the original problem, according to the previous link mentioned at the start, because the Sub is shared, I am experiencing session Hijacking. But if I dont share the SetInSession sub, the shared sub AssignPermissionsToSession which login needs to see cant access it.p  pSo basically I would really appreciate if someone could instruct me how to structure this class correctly without experiencing Accidental Session Hijacking. Thanks in Advancep  pThe Code as requested is as follows shrunk for brevityp  precodePublic NotInheritable Class cPermissions     local dictionary that gets created, and then assigned to session     Private Shared dPermissions As New DictionaryOf String, String      Public Shared Sub AssignPermissionToSessionByVal UserID As Integer         dPermissions.Clear          Here I open DB and get a list of Roles that each member may have         While ....             BuildPermissionArray         End While          Now dPermission should be created assign to session         SetInSessionPermissions, dPermissions     End Sub      Private Shared Sub BuildPermissionArray          Here we create the local Dictionary ready for the session          So for each role we get each permission for each control ie          dPermissions.addcontrol,perm     End Sub      Private Shared Sub SetInSessionByVal key As String, value As DictionaryOf String, String         If value Is Nothing Then             HttpContext.Current.Sessionkey  New DictionaryOf String, Integer         Else             HttpContext.Current.Sessionkey  value         End If     End Sub      Public Shared Function HasPermissionByVal PermissionType As Permission, ByVal ControlName As String As Boolean         Dim obj As Object  HttpContext.Current.SessionPermissions         Dim d As DictionaryOf String, String  DirectCastobj, DictionaryOf String, String         Here I search the dictionary and check relevant permission for the control name         Return result     End Function End Class                      codepre  pNow the Login code calls     cPermissions.AssignPermissionToSessionUserIDp  pAnd each page load reads the controls on the current page and calls     cPermissions.HasPermissionView,PageOrControlNamep

Negative 5602 pIm implementing an algorithm which has to quickly decide whether a path exists between two cells in a 2D grid for a mazelike game. It does not actually have to provide the path. This algorithm is run many thousands of times, so it must be fast.p  pThe quirk is, the two cells are very close to each other within a Manhattan distance of 2, so for most reasonable mazes, the path is often trivial. Right now I have pure breadthfirst search, but Im considering implementing a bidirectional variant. The problem is, of course, that in the cases a path does not exist, the bidirectional search will fail slower, because it searches two connected components instead of one, though if a path exists, it will find it faster probably.p  pSo my question is, does anyone have any experiences with bidirectional search and how it behaves in the cases mentioned above Is the speed difference actually quite marginalp

Negative 5602 pI am trying to receive the locations based on activity of the user,i.e., if the user is still the location updates are less frequent and if he is walking or driving the updates are quicker. I have written a service to receive the location updates and placed a broadcast receiver in the codeonCreatecode method which receives the intents broadcasted from main activity. These broadcasted intents carry the string that tell my broadcast receiver the activity of the user. But this receiver never receives the intents, so i am unable to set codelocationRequestcode timings, based on which I will pass the appropriate codelocationRequestcode to the services. p  pCan any body tell and help why is the broadcast reciever in the codeonCreatecode of services might not be getting called.

Basically, I want to wrap the selected text with a span tag so that I can position things relative to it. Ive seen it done before with highlighters, but I dont know how.p  pNote this only needs to work in Firefox.p

Negative 5602 pI am looking at an existing website, and I am trying to make some changes. I am trying to create a progress bar with some clicking capabilities. p  pFor example,  in the CSS file, the playbutton class is defined as thisp  precode.playButton     position absolute     display inlineblock     width 41px     height 41px     left 595px     top 19px     zindex 2  codepre  pin the index.html, I can see this class is used like thisp  precodeltdiv classplayButtongt     lta href idplayMe1gt         ltimg srcimagesplayButton.png altgt     ltagt ltdivgt codepre  pand in the JavaScript file, I can see thisp  precodeplayMe1.onclick,function      this.hide     pauseMe1.show     audioElement.play  codepre  pI made sure that no place else defines any sort of special hovering functionp  pNow, when I load the website, I can see that when my mouse is hovering over the playMe1 button, the mouse arrowshape, turns to a handshape, which indicates that I can click on the button. And, in fact, when I click on it, it does play the track.p  pThen I tried to add a progress bar, to monitor the progress of a playing track, and I was successful in doing that.br And, then I tried to get more interactive, and tried to have the option for the user to be able to click on the progress bar, and change the progress bar percentage, by clicking on it.p  pSo, in the CSS file, I defined thisp  precode.progressBar      border1px solid aaa     colorfff     width295px     height5px  .progress     backgroundcolorff0000    height5px    displayinlineblock  codepre  pThen, I added this to the html filep  precodeltdiv classprogressBargt     lta href idprogressBar1gt         ltspan classprogress idprogress1gtltspangt     ltagt ltdivgt codepre  pAnd, just as a test, I tried to test out my simple change, by coding the following in the JavaScript filep  precodeprogressBar1.onclick,function      var progress  document.getElementByIdprogress1     progress.style.width  70    codepre  pBut, I dont know why I am not able to click on the progress bar  I was expecting to see the mouse shape changes from arrow to hand when I was hovering over the progress bar, but it doesnt work. p  pCan someone tell me what is going on And, how should I get the progress bar to be able to be clickablep  pI didnt see any other code for the playbutton class, and that is why I thought if I copy the same thing it should work, but it doesnt work p  pThanks,  Rudyp

Negative 5602 pI have a filesystem like structure, where there are a bunch of folders that each contain the Object Id of their parent folder. Given a specific folder, I want to return the path to this folder the only way I can think of to do this is to traverse up the tree of linked Object Ids until I get to the root. p  pDoing this using just db.find, I would have to send out a number of queries equivalent to the depth of the folder. This doesnt scale however, so I am wondering of there is a way that mongo can chain the connected IDs for me, within a single request. Is this possible Or is there at least a better wayp

They also show the user, how far is that cab from the user, the possibility that might be here is Uber dudes could be using external GPS device and may be interfacing them with the users device. Since, If I am not wrong.. Apple does not allow tracking devices. p  pBut yet, I am in need to implement that kind of functionality in my App. I was wondering if it is possible  I am aware of location tracking, my concern here is live GPS tracking.p  pPlease point me in right direction here, Any help with be truly appreciatedp

Negative 5602 pI want to convert a .img File 512 Bytes header, 512x512 pixel with 8 bit per pixel Values 0255 to a .ras file. To do this I got the C code at the end of this post. The output of my test Image test.img should be a blackwhite image  so just containing values either 0 or 255. But the problem is, when I compile the C code from the bottom in windows, my resulting .ras file is white and a bright blue The curious thing is. When I compile the C code in Linux, then the result is perfectly blackwhite How can this come In both systems I used 64 bit.p  pSo you can try it out 1. compile C code with gcc lm img2ras.c o img2ras 2. Convert .img to .ras by console img2ras test.img test.ras 3. Watch .ras file either in gimp, XnView or PaintshopProp  pDo you have any clue how this awkward result can happen on different OS with the same Version of gcc 4.8.1p  ptest.img a hrefhttpwww.fileupload.netdownload8629102test.img.html relnofollowhttpwww.fileupload.netdownload8629102test.img.htmlap  pimg2ras.cp  precode this program accepts an input file which comes from the image  capturing board and an output file, which must be specified on the command line.

Negative 5602 pWe have a rather complex asynchronous system in JavaScript. All functions in the JavaScript library are designed to be asynchronous. We mainly use the AngularJS deferred objects and some parts use the jQuery we dont intermingle them though  i.e. Angular code waits on Angular deferred promises.p  pThe problem that we are coming across is that the code appears to hang on startup, 2 out of 5 times. There looks like there is a problem when the JS code is cached and the timing of the promise resolutions.p  pThere doesnt seem to be any tools or anything that can point to what the offending code is waiting on when a hang occurs.p  pHow do you find JavaScript code that is waiting on a promisep  pThanks.p

Negative 5602 pIm writing a multithreaded OpenMPI application, using MPIIsend and MPIIrecv from several threads to exchange hundreds of messages per second between ranks over InfiniBand RDMA.p  pTransfers are in the order of 400  800KByte, generating about 9 Gbps in and out for each rank, well within the capacity of FDR. Simple MPI benchmarks also show good performance.p  pThe completion of the transfers is checked upon by polling all active transfers using MPITestsome in a dedicated thread.p  pThe transfer rates I achieve depend on the message rate, but more importantly also on the polling frequency of MPITestsome. That is, if I poll, say, every 10ms, the requests finish later than if I poll every 1ms. p  pId expect that if I poll evert 10ms instead of every 1ms, Id at most be informed of finished requests 9ms later. Id not expect the transfers themselves to delay completion by fewer calls to MPITestsome, and thus slow down the total transfer rates. Id expect MPITestsome to be entirely passive.p  pAnyone here have a clue why this behaviour could occurp

Negative 5602 pI have a java web app, where one of the functionalities I need, is to fetch an existing date, and have the option of editing the date, by selecting another. This works really good with a JQuery DatePicker that I found, in combination with a regular input field, type text, that triggers the datepicker.p  pMy existing date GregorianCalendar objects are loaded from a database, and parsed into JavaBeans, and further loaded into the jsp page, and the specific input field.p  pHowever, Javas SimpleDateFormat, JSTL functionstag library, and DatePickers a hrefhttpapi.jqueryui.comdatepickerutilityformatDate relnofollowformatDate functiona does not interpret formatting styles the same way. MM in java and JSTL gives 03, while in the DatePicker, it gives March as output. My desired 03 is achieved by the pattern mm in DatePicker, but then it shows the objects minutes, if any, in JSTL.p  pI figure there are two options. Either I create two patterns which can format the different outputs to the same desired String. Or I could use datePickers formatDatefunction to format my java date object upon loading of the data.p  pI much desire to have only one global string pattern for my datepicker, because I want to be able to change the pattern without breaking the code, or having to many dependencies. Therefor solution number 2 is what I want.p  pRight now, this is my code for getting the formatted date String, using tag librariesp  precodeltfmtformatDate typedate                  patternappdata.dateFormat                                valuemyBeanObject.gregorianCalendarObject.timegt ltfmtformatDategt codepre  pI want something likep  precode.datepicker.formatDate appdata.dateFormat,                            myBeanObject.gregorianCalendarObject.time codepre  pHowever, with my limited JQueryJavascript experience, I do not know how or where to put this code, and how to invoke the function correctly. Everything I seem to find about invoking scripts seem to involve an onclick, or readyfunctions. I merely want to get the string, while building the page.p  pI realise that my problem is more basic than my title, but if anyone has another idea on how to get javas and the DatePickers formatting patterns to play along, I would be happy to hear them. If not, how can I invoke the script, and get that String I wantp  pThanks in advance. p  pstrongEDITstrongp  pSo far I have added a small parser in my singleton applicationwide data object. When setting the dateFormatstring, it automatically parses the String to one that is matching JQuery DatePickers mismatching interpretation. But to make this really work, I would need to add a whole lot of possible translations, other than month and yearpatterns.p  precodepublic void setDateFormatString dateFormat      this.dateFormat  dateFormat     datePickerFormat  dateFormat.replaceAllyyyy, yy     datePickerFormat  datePickerFormat.replaceAllM, m  codepre

Negative 5602 pWithin a griview using IE, cells in one column are clickable through gridview row command event and once a cell is clicked it displays a hidden textbox visible  false before the cell is clicked users can enter text into the textbox and to allow saving changes made to the textbox users are told to press Tab key.  The saving is done through using Javascript by checking keycode in keydown event, it simply checks when codekeycode  9 Tab key doPostbackOnClick,SaveButtoncode in codebehind codeSaveButtoncode onclick event simply calls a store procedure to save the new text changes into database.p  pThe problem I have is keydown event is not ALWAYS fired though it works most of the time. There seems to be no difference to the situation when it works and when it doesnt, so to me its a bit random and I have to emphaise that it works 90 of the time. p  pWorth mentioning that when users click the cell to edit the textbox, gridview row updating event is fired first since I need to enable gridview row updating event not only for this column text changes but also for other columns data updating.p  pWhen everything works after user pressing the Tab key, the event sequence is p  ol liGridview row updating  li liKeydownSaveButton click  li liGridview row updatingli ol  pI dont understand what triggers the event 3 i.e. the second gridview row updating event though it doesnt do any harm to anything as its after the text being saved into database. But when pressing Tab key doesnt work text not saved the second gridview row updating event is not fired only the 1st row updating event is fired and textbox changes are lost reverting back to the original text.p  pIm new to asp.net and hope someone can shred some light on this problem.p

Negative 5602 pi am trying to get the body of an email and set it to a variable with powershell by using getmailbox. the reason im not doing it an easier was is it is blocked on the network to get the body from outlook. im completly lost. ive tried export but thats to pst. ive tried doing a search query with logging but thats a bust also. im pretty lost  anything to point me in the direction would be great.p
Negative 5602 pI am trying to use the automated row level security in tableau 8.1 but if I create the security at the highest level it doesnt pass the security to the children of the level.  I can only achieve this by creating a massive excel sheet that has every object that I want to allow access to.  I could use the manual way but that is too tedious.  I am sure someone has found a way around this but I cant find anything online.  p
Negative 5602 pIf I understand correctly, there are membership groups at three levels in TFS  SERVER, COLLECTION and PROJECT, with different security settings for each.p  pA user without a CAL presumably must, directly or indirectly, be a member of a SERVER level group which has the permission Use full Web Access features set to Deny, such as the builtin group [TEAM FOUNDATION]Work Item Only View Users. However,p  ul lia PROJECT administrator cannot edit the membership of SERVER level groups, andli lia SERVER level group cannot contain PROJECT or COLLECTION level groups.li ul  pSo how is it possible for a PROJECT administrator to give a user this limited access The example scenarios Ive found all suggest that a SERVER administrator must first add the user to a SERVER group with the correct permissions set, then the PROJECT administrator must add the same user to the PROJECT Contributors group, i.e. the user has to be added twice by two different people.p  pIronically, a PROJECT administrator can give a user full access to a project by simply adding them to the Contributors group. This seems to be completely the wrong way round. Surely it should be possible for the PROJECT administrator to give limited access directly, with full access only being granted by the SERVER administrator, once it has been verified that the new user has a valid CAL.p  pIf anyone knows how I can give a PROJECT administrator the ability to grant work item only access to a project without the SERVER admin needing to do anything, please let me know. Thanks in advance.p

Negative 5602 pToday, I answered an ordinary a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions22893152getobjectnameofaclassfromtheuserinjavaquestiona of some Java beginner. A little bit later I thought it would be fun to take his question seriously and so I implemented exactly what he wants.p  pI created a simple code for runtime Class generation. Most of the code is taken from a template, the only possible change is to declare some fields.

Programmer enters all the possible keys and then it generates a Class where each key is as a field. In the moment we have instance of this class, we may also save or read those generated fields using reflection.p  pHere is a whole codep  precodeimport java.io.ByteArrayOutputStream import

I expected it would be a little bit faster as data are stored in fields, which are manipulated by JVM using a native code. The most serious explanation which I can think of is that reflection is extremely slow.p  pTo make it perfectly clear, I was not going to use it anyway. Event if it actually was faster that code is so terrible and unmaintainable it would not be worth of it. A functionality is also very limited key must be a valid field name etc. It just looked like a cool experiment.p  pAnyway, does anybody have an idea why is it about 100 times slower than ordinary hash table I guess it is caused by a reflection, but I would appreciate other peoples opinions.p  pstrongUpdatestrong It is really caused by reflection as Antimony and NSF pointed out. I tried to set up some static field in the normal way and using reflection. According to this test, reflection is about 280 times slower. But I have no idea why.p

I can deal with this by passing a block to each association e.g. codenamecode, codeemailcode, codeusercode and so on mention but it seems to be ugly and not DRY.p  ol liIs there way to let codefactorygirlcode know sequence in which files should be loadedli lito deal with complex dependencies when its not possible to fix this issue with changing load sequence of filesli ol
Negative 5602 pI have been searching for a answer for a, so it seems, rather specific problem. Ive tried google, stackoverflow and to an extent, the microsoft forums.p  pFor a school project Im building a track and trace application, for an imaginary milk processing company. Some of the features it is supposed to have is that it can keep record of all the trucks, show a map of the area and show the state of the truck, its whereabouts and its freight. All the data is provided using a MySQL database. p  pI already managed to create a route and show it on my map using the code provided here a hrefhttpsocial.msdn.microsoft.comForumsenUSd7b0b27235f347248546dce9bd8b1e3dwpfbingmapcontrolhowtodrawroutelinesforumbingmapssilverlightwpfcontrols relnofollowhttpsocial.msdn.microsoft.comForumsenUSd7b0b27235f347248546dce9bd8b1e3dwpfbingmapcontrolhowtodrawroutelinesforumbingmapssilverlightwpfcontrolsap  pNow the problem is, Id like to make it possible to let a pushpin move along a route, from start to end. For example, I create a route from Liverpool to Manchester, a blue line will show up on the map. The idea is that I create a pushpin ontop of Liverpool and make it move along the line all the way until it reaches Manchester.p  pI figured the best solution is to use a thread or timer that will changeupdate the location, using an event that fires, of the pushpin, but I simply do not know where to start.p

Negative 5602 pSo Im writing a hrefhttpsgithub.comrhgrant10Pants relnofollowthis Python programa that implements the ACO algorithm. Briefly, when an ant goes to make its next move, it knows 1 which node it is on and 2 which nodes it still needs to visit. With that information, it inspects the properties of each codeEdgecode in order to choose which codeNodecode it should visit next. So I have the ant use that information to look up the corresponding codeEdgecode.p  pInternally, Im using a codedictcode to map codeNodecode pairs to codeEdgecode instances. Originally, I was okay with the restriction that a codeNodecode must be hashable. However, it has always been a restriction I didnt particularly enjoy imposing, and Id like to eliminate it if at all possible.p  pCurrently, I have a codeNodecode class that implements codehashcode by hashing a codefrozensetcode of the objects codedict.itemscode, but this still produces errors for cases involving mutable values and it is, by far, my least favorite class  ever.p  pSo far Ive thought about using a 2D matrix, but it may often be the case that the codeEdgecodes are few compared to the codeNodecodes, which would result in a sparse matrix, and therefore much wasted space. Ive thought about using a simple list, but then I loose the ability to do superfast lookups.p  h3TLDRh3  pemWhat data structures can I use preferred if the implementation is solid or selfimplement that will grant fast lookups of codeEdgecodes from pairs of codeNodecodes without involving the generation of hashesemp

Negative 5602 pIm trying to think of a way to implement a mosaic effect with renderscript as a learning exercise but I cant find enough information to know which of these methods, if any, will work.p  ol lipSplit a bitmap into n x n pixel subbitmaps. Run each subbitmap through a script that averages the value all pixels, then rejoin the bitmaps back into one in java. I worry that using forEachroot may result in concurrency issues if different pixels are updating the same global variable at the same time. I could use a loop to iterate through each pixel in the subbitmap to avoid concurrency issues, but then I would lose the benefit of forEachroot.pli lipKeep the original bitmap intact and run forEachroot. In the script, if I can know the coordinates of the element, I could figure out which square the pixel should be in and then add each pixel to the relative 0,0 for the square in which it resides.pli lipIf I can create an allocation that only includes select pixels then I can have one pixel for each mosaic square and add each other pixel in that square to the representative pixel. This will avoid concurrency issues if they exist, while still allowing multiple simultanious executionspli ol  pI really like number 3, but Im not sure if such an allocation can be created. Alternatively, If collisions resulting from different renderscript threads accessing the same variable at the same time are handled gracefully then method one or two are probably easier.p

Negative 5602 pI am documenting this here to help other people with the same problem. p  pLiferay user import on login caused UserScreenNameException. Thanks to a colleague, we found this to be caused by special characters in the users screen name like underscores etc.. Since this was a valid use case, we had to find a way allow the special characters. Liferay by default does not allow special characters in screen name. p  pOnce we added the following property to the portalext.properties file, there were no more errors and users got imported properly.p  pcodeProperty to try to allow special characters in screen name users.screen.name.validatorcom.liferay.portal.security.auth.LiberalScreenNameValidatorcode p  pHope this helps someone.p
Negative 5602 pI want to place an image that is 1500px wide and I want this image to have its full size displayed in smaller screen resolutions, like 1024x768px. I dont want to use maxwidth 100 because that will resize the image and thats exactly what I dont want. I want instead to  show its native resolution and hide the rest of the image. And the image cannot be a background.p  pLike thisp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.com4S9NH.png altenter image description herep  pThank youp  pEdit Heres an example. Im using Bootsrap 3. In smaller resolutions it breaks the page. I want it to be fullwidth without resizing it.

Negative 5602 pI have a WPF application that needs to retrieve around 60000 records by calling an external webservice. The webservice returns them in a HUGE json, once i receive it I need to deserialize it into my list of objects. What is the best approach for this so that this process does not take too long while loading them up .p  pAlso in the same way, at some point i need to send those same records for verification, but should i do them all at the same timep  pAny architectural advise would be appreciated, no need for code but some orientation is desired tools i can use to make it more efficient etc...p
Negative 5602 pI have three tables codecategoriescode id, name, codeproductscode id, categoryid, name, and codepurchasescode id, userid, productid. A codeproductcode belongs to a codecategorycode. Users can purchase many codeproductscode. My intention is to find the most popular codecategorycode per user. p  pHowever, I need to use the resultset of the query as a subquery, so using any codeORDER BYcode statements unfortunately is off, due to SQL Server limitations the dreaded codeThe ORDER BY clause is invalid in views, inline functions, derived tables, and subqueries, unless TOP is also specified.code error. p  pMy approach has been to create a list of all codepurchasescode per user per codecategorycode. I then have a codeMAXcode function to pick out the maximum amount of codepurchasescode. I JOIN that result to the original query duplicated as a subquery to retrieve the codecategoryidcode in question, and finally I grab the category name. p  pThere are two issues with my query p  ol liObviously Id prefer not using the same query twice in my code. However, I cannot rely on using CTEs or temp tables, as the result of this query is intended to be linked to a view that has a subset of userdata as it is, and the VIEW code is intended to be used in a thirdparty package, that can handle only basic SQL code. li liIn case of a tie say a useer bought 4 codeproductscode, 2 from 2 codecategoriescode each, I end up with a duplicate row for that user. li ol  pFiddlep  pa hrefhttpsqlfiddle.com68821b5 relnofollowhttpsqlfiddle.com68821b5ap  pId appreciate it if anyone be able to help me figure out a way to ensure only a single row is returned per user, as well as a way to remove the duplicate subquery.p  pThanksp
Negative 5602 pIm trying to find the best approach for dynamically creating the subcontents of an element created using a directive. p  pTo give a simple example, say I have directive that say creates a basic codedivcode child element.p  precodeltdiv mydirectivegtltdivgt codepre  presults in p  precodeltdiv mydirectivegtltdivgtltdivgtltdivgt codepre  pThe directive might look something likep  precodeangular.moduledemo, [] .directivemydirective, function      return          restrict A,                    template   ltdivgtltdivgt       codepre  pThen say I wanted to create an extension to this directive that makes the inner codedivcode blue.  Because I dont know what future extensions Ill need I dont want to switch the template or bind any specific attributes.p  pI dont know what of these are possible, or what the normal approach is... but can you p  p1 Add an additional directive to the parent element bit like css i.e.p  precodeltdiv mydirective mybluedirectivegtltdivgt codepre  pWhere the codemybluedirectivecode looks for the inner div and manipulates itp  porp  p2 Can you include directive dynamically in the template, e.g.p  pcodeltdiv mydirective subdirectivemybluedirectivegtltdivgtcodep  precodeangular.moduledemo, [] .directivemydirective, function      return          restrict A,                    template   ltdiv [[[THE SUBDIRECTIVE PROPERTY FROM SCOPE]]gtltdivgt       codepre  pIs there a way you can intercept precompile to inject the directivep  pa third option as Ive ready is to use a factory and inherited classes to do the work for the directive, but that seems an overkill.p  pIm guessing there is an easy way I dont know about, any advice appreciatedp  pEDITp  pI think what Im trying to do is dynamically modify the template to use another directive before its compiled.p

This would be easy with ddply if say I wanted the mean price for each ID for each month split by id and month from Dataframe B or if I wanted the average ratio of sqft to traf for each id split by id.p  pBut what would be a potential solution if I wanted to make combined variables from both dataframes. For instance, how would I get the average price for each idmonth Dataframe B divided by sqft for each idmonth p  pThe varying frequencies at of the dataframes are measured makes combining them not easily doable. The only solution Ive found so far is to ddply the first dataframe to extract average sqftidmonth and then pass that value into a second ddply call on the second dataframe.p  pIs there a more efficientless convoluted way to do this I would be splitting both dataframes on the same variables id and month.p  pThanks in advance for any suggestionsp

declaring that I need parenthesis where parenthesis do not go, and semicolons where tehy do not go after an instance variable, or int command, or whatever, and they all say how my exact code here requires some code that eimplies something unrelated to the parameters that follow a constructor, or the setget command parameters. p  pNow, if I remove codepublic static void main String[] args code from the code entirely, and just declare a class file, then a constructor with the instance variables and commands, it will compile the Java file just fine. My only issue then, is that the Command Prompt will demand I include a main. And upon including a main, all 1426 of those errors occur to everything relating to the constructor, instance variables, and commands. p  pIm sure that I wont get this program done by tomorrow now. p

Negative 5602 pI have spent a day researching and trying various samples without success in being able to update imported records from a lookup table, however most samples use a straightforward lookup table that has the relevant info, which is not the scenario I have.p  pI am importing employee records into a Users table. I have created an Import table that contains the employee details as well as the manager Email address for each user. For example FirstName, LastName, Email, ManagerEmail.p  pFrom the Import table the records excepting ManagerEmail are then inserted into the Users table. Only once this has been done will the user now have a UserId. The challenge is now to update the newly created User record with the ManagerId Which would be the Manangers UserId.p  pI could create a UserId and ManagerId field in the Import table and run a script to update these values after the User records have been created and then use this to update the Users table, however it would be a challenge to update the Users table based only on having the Email and ManagerEmail relationship in the Import table.p  pPlease let me know if my explanation needs further clarification. Any help would be appreciated and I will continue researching in the meantime.p

I personally know and have done this multiple times before how to do this with jQuery via button bindings meaning I would dynamically bind functions to yesno buttons and then invoke the confirmation dialogue by changing the class for example remove displaynone, but I have not a clue how to do this with AngularJs and I would very much like to learn that. I have also tried using jQuery within angular for these problems and it works perfectly, yet again I would love to learn how to do this the Angular way. p  pNOTE I can of course simply inject HTML for confirmation dialogue into every scope where I need it and assign data binders but I think that such a way would be very redundant. p

Negative 5602 pI realize this question has been asked in the past but the latest one I can find is from 2011 so I thought it was applicable to bring this up again.  Let me explain my requirement in question through an example.p  pOur company makes relay control boards which you can operate from android.  You can take a look at them a hrefhttpwww.controlanything.comRelayRelayANDROIDRELAYSTANDARD relnofollowherea. We have Bluetooth, WiFi, and Ethernet relay boards which you can operate from android using our free app a hrefhttpsplay.google.comstoreappsdetailsidcom.controlanything.NCDTCPRelayamphlen relnofollowherea. Sorry if this is starting to sound like a sales pitch just trying to put things into context.  These relays could be used for something such as opening a garage door.p  pMy friend recently got an Android watch which supports the OK Google voice commands.  We thought it would be cool to run a background service started from the application which could register a receiver for voice activated broadcast intents.  So if the speech command matched a string such as OK Google Open garage door, which the user could edit in the app, we could connect to the relay board and and turn it on momentarily which would result in opening the garage door.p  pSo is this possible  If not why the heck not  Sounds like something we as Android developers should have access to and could open up a whole world of possibilities.p

Negative 5602 pI have a load test project that I run regularly from the Visual Studio using the Load Test GUI. I would like to run that test from the command line by changing its parameters such as the number of users, run duration etc. p  pIn visual studio load test, there are usually 3 type of settings that I usually play around. p  ol liTest setting for general controller and agent assignments. li liRun settings in which I set the run duration, where to save the logs of the test results etc.li liScenario settings used to set the load pattern and test mix etc.li ol  pIdeally I should be able to change any of these settings using some command line parameters of MSTEST utility or assigning a setting file for each goal, however I havent been able to accomplish that setting change using the MSTEST command line options. I am able to run the load test using the state where I left off before exiting the GUI, however I cannot set the runsetting that is not currently active or I cannot change the user load defined in the scenario settings. p  pFor my current task, being able to change the user load from the command line is more urgent than changing other parameters. So if someone knows how to change Scenario Settings from the command line that would be great help. I already tried creating more than one scenario with different number of users however in Visual Studio, seems like it is not possible to select particular scenario and execute test using it. Once the load test starts, it runs every available scenarios sequentially. So I think for my purpose I should create only one scenario and be able to change the user load from command line somehow.p  pThanks for the help in advance. p

Negative 5602 pHeres the situation since it was difficult to summarize the problem in the titlep  pI have several repositories that contain npmbased code to run different parts of the product. So, for example, there is a nodejs backend repository, a javascript frontend repository, a private npm module that is used by those repos etc etc. p  pNormally, I codecdcode into each repositorymodule and run a codegulp watchcode task that opens a codeconnectcode middleware server to serve unminified files to run the whole application. So there is an instance of backend running on codelocalhost3000code while the frontend runs on codelocalhost8000code and the built files from the private npm module are served via codelocalhost3030code, and so on. p  pIs there a way to write one gulp watch task that can automatically build all the files with the dependencies in each repo and serve them through their respective codeconnectcode servers In other words, can there be one task to run all the instances and watch them when I make changes to any file in any one of the repos I guess I would need to have a new repository that loads all the other repos as a dependency and then run the singleton gulp watch task from there but its just a hunch and I was wondering if there is a better approach before I try this one out.p  pOr is there a better way to be productive in such a scenariop

Im not sure if its the right thing to do, in fact im pretty sure theres a more beautiful way to do it, but i found a solution to do exactly what i wanted to.p  pHeres the code p  precodeiftabloid.isDoublontitle         tabloid.addTitletitle          ObservableList colData  FXCollections.observableArrayList         TableColumn col  new TableColumntitle         col  addContextualMenucol         col.setEditabletrue         final int j  tabloid.getTitle.length1         col.setCellValueFactorynew CallbackltCellDataFeaturesltObservableList,Stringgt,ObservableValueltStringgtgt                                   public ObservableValueltStringgt callCellDataFeaturesltObservableList, Stringgt param                        try                        return new SimpleStringPropertycolData.getj.toString                        return new SimpleStringPropertyparam.getValue.getj.toString                                         catchException e                        return new SimpleStringProperty                                                                              tabloid.addColumncolData         table.getColumns.addAllcol       codepre  pAs you can see, i instantiate an object named colData that is used to set the data in the TableView, then i put this object in my Tabloid you just need to know that it contains all the data to immediatly build a new TableView if necessary. Then i just need to modify the list in my object, then refresh the table and it seems to work.p  pAnyway, its hard to read, hard to understand ... So i keep this topic open if someone has a solution, maybe it will be easier to do with a code that do work the way i needed.p

Negative 5602 pCan Bloom Filter cause physical IO to filter.DB per insert command We are currently performing a performance matchup and Cassandra is one of our options. We experience a very strange phenomenon in Cassandra. This question is not about performance though.  We are using Cassandra 2.1.2 apache community version on Windows server 2012. only 2 nodes and no replication.br We use NAS storage.p  pKeyspace definition CREATE KEYSPACE mykeyspace WITH replication  class SimpleStrategy, replicationfactor 1  Table definition CREATE TABLE mykeyspace.mytable      signature uuid PRIMARY KEY,     data blob  p  pCommitLog is stored on local machine. Data is stored on NAS.  While performing a 100M rows insert using C driver to the table we experience IO of a byte per row added to the filter.db. We used MS process monitor in order to observe this phenomenon.  This is causing many IOPS about 40005000 per second only for the filter.db file. We expected to see zero 0 writes in NAS most of the time and lots of activity only due to MemTable flush to NAS and or compaction. instead we see tons of tiny IOPS every second.  When we disabled bloom filters as followsp  pCREATE TABLE mykeyspace.mytable      signature uuid PRIMARY KEY,     data blob  WITH bloomfilterfpchance  1.0p  pWe saw no IOPS per row inserted. Which is the expected phenomenon as far as we understand. .  We do however also require Bloom Filter for reads at a later stage. The question is, why do we get IO per row written in filter.db and why isnt that a part of a MemTable flush Thank you for your assistance.p

Negative 5602 pI have a loop in a section of a script and it runs very slowly.  I was hoping to get some advice on improving this.p  pI have 8 pairs of data sets. Each pair is comprised of an Array 1dimensional, and typically 400 string elements and a column with typically around 2000 string elements.

Negative 5602 pI feel that C should allow codeswitchcode over any type that can be compared, not just integral types. It seems odd thatp  precodeswitchmyEnum      case myEnumValue1         ... break     case myEnumValue1         ... break  codepre  pIs semantically the same asp  precodeifmyEnum  myEnumValue1     ... else ifmyEnum  myEnumValue2     ... codepre  pBut this only works on integral types. Why What is the purpose of such a restrictionp  pI understand that the compilergenerated code for codeswitchcode may only be compatible with integral or registersized types, but these kinds of things are normally blackboxed from the developers decisions. These kinds of things are normally abstracted from us. If a jump table is better, the compiler should generate one. If a typical codeifcodecodeelsecode algorithm is needed, so be it.p

Negative 5602 pI have to start with code reviews in my company. Currently I am using netbeans with SVN on windows.

Negative 5602 pIm having an issue with WPFs WebBrowser control. Its crashing with the titular error when Im changing tabs  I think I know why explained below, but I cant think of a way around it. Im looking for either ideas on how I might reorganize the code to work correctly, or alternatives on what Im using to achieve my goal.p  pThe setup of the program is this There are multiple tabs, containing BordersGridsetc. On one of these tabs, there is a Grid which has Widgets, each containing a WebBrowser. These browsers are loading various locallyhosted pages with information for the user. To make the widgets look good, some code runs in the LoadCompleted event of the browser.p  precodebrow  new WebBrowser brow.LoadCompleted  wbLoadCompleted codepre  pThe wbLoadCompleted function isnt important the program will crash emasem its being called, not during its execution.p  pAlso, when the user changes tabs, these Widgets have a Dispose function thats called.p  precodebrow.LoadCompleted  wbLoadCompleted brow.Source  null codepre  pNow if the user opens the tab with these Widgets, then after the pages begin loading, but embefore they finish loading and call that eventem, the user switches tabs again, the program will crash once it attempts to call the wbLoadCompleted event. I think this is happening because of the error a hrefhttpssocial.msdn.microsoft.comForumsvstudioenUS86057c78b4344b3cab6d6b132b4bf834wpfbugfatalexception0x80131623andreturneventhandlerforumwpf relnofollowdescribed herea. The handlers have been disposed because the tab changed, but the thread wants to call the handlers. In Visual Studio, if I place a break on the wbLoadCompleted method, itll be on that breakpoint when the error is thrown, so I think the program still knows what code it should be running, it just doesnt have permission to.p  pSo far Ive been unable to find a workaround or solution. Beyond code fix attempts, Ive tried using different browser controls Awesemonium, and a few others while they work without this error, but they also balloon the size of our program distribution by 30 meg. That nearly doubles the size, and its not feasible for us to do so. Any alternative browser control that works would be great, but it needs to be 10 meg max.p  pI can also share some other code if you let me know what you need to see however, Id imagine this is more of a timingplacementordering issue than current code issue, if that makes sense.p  pe Adding the full error textp  pManaged Debugging Assistant FatalExecutionEngineError has detected a problem in programpathp  pAdditional information The runtime has encountered a fatal error. The address of the error was at 0x6bd5e4ad, on thread 0xa54. The error code is 0x80131623. This error may be a bug in the CLR or in the unsafe or nonverifiable portions of user code.

Negative 5602 pI need to represent the workflow of a process. I need more than a simple graph because the children of a node depend on the previous steps. Exp  precodeA  gt B gt [C, D] A gt B gt  C codepre  pAnother requirement that I have is that it should be easily modified and extended, maintaining the consistency. So for example if a node doesnt exist anymore it should be able to still know the path that it took to get there and a way to continue the flow from there.p  pThe best thing that I was able to come up is a multivalue weighted graph. The weight of an arch is determined by the version of the flow and a value inside a predetermined range 1  100, so if you get to the node using an arch with version 2 and value 5 you con move to adjacent nodes that have archs with version 2 and value between 1 and 100.p  pI know that there should be a better way to do this, but I cant come up with anything else or find anything that fits. p

Negative 5602 pI need some guidance in solving an issue with high lighting a navigation bar when the user is in a site not under the same collection. Currently there is a cross site collection navigation bar, the list consists of 5 items which are Home, Teams, apps, docs, organisation.p  pwhen the url is sitesUKpages... its works fine the right item is active, once you select a link that takes you to something outside that UK site collection the nav bar has no high lighting. such as when the site collection url changes to sitesUKexternalteams.... when the url reads as this i want the team nav item to remain high lighted.p  pAny guidance on how i could achieve this is much appreciated.p

Negative 5602 pIm encountering an interesting phenomena with Swift 1.2 and Xcode.  My familiarity with the language and library innerworkings are not sufficient to understand why this happens.  Perhaps someone can explain.  Consider the following code blockp  precodestatic func hideSpinnerspinnerViewParent UIViewController       for thissubview in spinnerViewParent.view.subviews              if thissubview is SpinnerView               UIView.animateWithDuration0.25, animations thissubview as SpinnerView.alpha  0.0, completion completed in thissubview.removeFromSuperview              break if you break, it will subvert and hijack the completion closure                codepre  pSpinnerView is a simple subclass of a UIView which throws a spinner on screen to alert the user that the app is thinking.  The hideSpinner function fades the SpinnerView out, and then removes it from the parent view.p  pThe problem is, if you leave the break in, the completion block of the animateWithDuration call will not execute properly.p  pIf you comment out the break, it works as intended.p  pWhy  Does breaking the loop somehow subvert and orphan the closure callback  Why does removing the break make it work as intendedp

Negative 5602 pIn our windows store app we save the files that the users are creating in an epub file, which is a zip archive with file extension .epub The app is written primarily in HTML and JS, but to handle the writing to the zip archive we use some C in a helper.p  pThis all works, but I have found that the zip archive can become corrupted if the app suspends whilst writing to the zip, as sometimes when adding a particularly large file to the zip, say a 100mb video file, the operation does not complete in the 5 seconds allowed from oncheckpoint.p  pAre there any ways that I could avoid this problem As far as I can see there is just no way to write a large file to a zip and be 100 sure that it wont get corrupted if the app suspends.p

Negative 5602 pCurrently my applications can do as follows. It can read a JSON configuration such asp  precode   a 5,   b 3  codepre  pInto a POJO that looks likep  precodepublic class AddConf    private Number a   private Number b    constructor, getters and setters   public int add      return a.intValue  b.intValue     codepre  pThen we can call the add function a return a result of 8 in this example. I would like to augment com.fasterxml.jackson.databind somehow to allow my JSON to have placeholders. So lets say when my configuration I dont know what value b will be until runtime, then I might make a configuration like thisp  precode   a 5,   b bplaceholder  codepre  pTo signify that b value will be provided at runtime. Obviously the above is not a valid JSON, and by default jackson throws an Exception as it should when it attempts to parse this with ObjectMappers readValue. Ideally, I would like to read the above JSON or something equivalent into a POJO that looks something like thisp  precodepublic class AddConf    private MapltString,Stringgt usedPlaceholders   private Number a   private Number b    constructor, getters and setters   public int addMapltString,Stringgt runtimeConf      if usedPlaceholders.containsa    if a was a placeholder       a  runtimeConf.getusedPlaceholder.geta          if usedPlaceholders.containsb    if b was a placeholder       b  runtimeConf.getusedPlaceholder.getb          return a.intValue  b.intValue      public void setPlaceholderString key, String value      usedPlaceholder.putkey, value     codepre  pThe idea is when deserializing the augmented JSON above, it would call setPlaceholderb, bplaceholder instead of setting the value b and therefore when add is called, it will use values in the passed in runtimeConf Map instead of values from the JSON to do its configuration.p  pGiven this, I have 2 questionsp  pIs there an easier way to accomplish my goal of having placeholders in my JSON configuration It seems if I was to implement my idea here, I would have to override some of the Jackson classes. I would have to override the com.fasterxml.jackson.core.JsonParser to allow  as a valid token in some scenarios, I would also have to write custom derserializers for all my configuration POJO such as AddConf. This would likely casade into me having to override much of the jackson code base, which I would rather not do. p  pIf I were to take this approach to override some of the default jackson classes, how might I go about doing that p  pI am currently using jackson 2.6.0 p

Negative 5602 pIm trying to achieve something with Django Rest Framework.

Since this should not be very clear, an example  p  pThe model would be p  precodeclass Sitemodels.Model     title  models.CharFieldTitle,maxlength300     titlemodified  models.CharFieldTitle,maxlength300 codepre  pThe viewset to be defined p  precodeclass SiteViewSetviewsets.ModelViewSet    serializerclass  SiteSerializer    queryset  Site.objects.all codepre  pThe serializer  p  precodeclass SiteSerializerserializers.ModelSerializer     class Meta         model  Site         depth  1 codepre  pWhat i want to do is be able to only serve the title data to the client, but the title would have either the title field if titlemodified is empty or the titlemodified field if its not empty. On the same idea when the client writes to the title i would like my server to write the data to titlemodified instead and always leave the title info untouched.p  pI dont know how to achieve this a way thats generic enough to be applicable to all types of fields.

Negative 5602 pLets prefix this by my objects equals implementation is not how I need to filter so codedistinctcode itself does not work.p  precodeclass MyObject    String foo   MyObject String foo       this.foo  foo      public String getFoo  return foo     CollectionltMyObjectgt listA  Arrays.asLista, b, c.stream.mapMyObjectnew         .collectCollectors.toList  CollectionltMyObjectgt listB  Arrays.asListb, d.stream.mapMyObjectnew         .collectCollectors.toList    magic codepre  pHow can I merge and deduplicate the lists so that the resulting list should be of MyObjects containing a, b, c, dp  pNote This is a simplification of what methods we actually need to deduplicate, which are actually complex DTOs of entities loaded by hibernate, but this example should adequately demonstrate the objective.p
Negative 5602 pI am using jqgrid4.5.4 and implemented multisorting in it using code below.p  precodemultiSort true codepre  pThe client also wants to see what column they sorted first and so on. Do we have a way to display it in jqgrid If this feature doesnt exist, we request this in future release. Thanksp  pMy suggestion is p  pTo show the list of columnname, sorticon and a close button next to it in the form of strongtagsstrong similar to stack overflow tagsthis would be great.Just plain list is also fine. It can be displayed on topbelow the grid. It should keep updating each time the sort is performed. We can remove sort on particular column by deleting the tag or clicking on column headerdefault behavior. The multisort order should still be preserved. p
Negative 5602 pIm using a codeUITableViewcode with sections to build index table, lets say that i have an Array with 500 of string data. Now i need to index the table for an easy scroll  by 1 , 50 , 100 , 150 , 200 and so on until 500. so when i scroll to 50 i go to indexPath.row 50. p  pi really couldnt achieve it and i tried the following  p  precodeIBOutlet weak var mytableView UITableView  var tableData  [String] var indexOfNumbers  [String]  override func viewDidLoad      super.viewDidLoad      Do any additional setup after loading the view, typically from a nib.       tableData  [       500 lines of string array of different starting letter      ]      let indexNumbers  0 50 100 150 200 250 300 350 400 450 500     indexOfNumbers  indexNumbers.componentsSeparatedByString      override func didReceiveMemoryWarning      super.didReceiveMemoryWarning      Dispose of any resources that can be recreated.     func numberOfSectionsInTableViewtableView UITableView gt Int      return tableData.count    func tableViewtableView UITableView, cellForRowAtIndexPath indexPath NSIndexPath gt UITableViewCell      let cell  tableView.dequeueReusableCellWithIdentifiercell, forIndexPath indexPath        Configure the cell...     cell.textLabel.text  tableData[indexPath.section]      return cell     func tableViewtableView UITableView, numberOfRowsInSection section Int gt Int      return 1    func sectionIndexTitlesForTableViewtableView UITableView gt [String]       return indexOfNumbers   func tableViewtableView UITableView, sectionForSectionIndexTitle title String, atIndex index Int gt Int      let temp  indexOfNumbers as NSArray     return temp.indexOfObjecttitle  codepre
