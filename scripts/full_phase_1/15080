Negative 15080 blockquote   pstrongPossible Duplicatestrongbr   a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions913228shouldidisposedatasetanddatatableShould I Dispose DataSet and DataTablea  p      pOP comment I would like to say that the Should I Dispose DataSet and DataTable link isnt a possible solution. Its a good link, but this is more design related. Instead, ignore that the exposed property is a DataSet and replace it with something that should be disposed.  The same question would apply there.p blockquote  pIm messing around with Crystal Reports, and I have a ReportData class.  In other words, this class encapsulates the Filling of the DataSet I will use.p  precodepublic class ReportData      private DataSet1 mDS  null  Notice this disposable member variable      public ReportData ... some parameters ...              mDS  new DataSet1          Plus some other manipulation on mDS           public DataSet1 GetDataSet              get                      return mDS                     Everything else is pretty much private.      This class is here to generate my DataSet  codepre  pHere is how it would be used by some other classp  precodeprivate void SetReportDataSource      DataSet1 ds  mRptData.GetDataSet     mRpt.SetDataSourceds  codepre  pIm pretty much learning C on the fly read a couple of chapters in an intro book, and just went at it, googling everything along the way.  From what I understand, if it implements IDisposable, you better Dispose it.  A DataSet implements IDisposable, so we need to Dispose it.p  pHeres where the design part comes inp  pQuestion 1a Do I make my ReportData class IDisposablep  pIn other words, it looks like I could just do this and be done with itp  precodeprivate void SetReportDataSource      using DataSet1 ds  mRptData.GetDataSet              mRpt.SetDataSourceds       codepre  pQuestion 1b Should I be more defensive in some wayp  pI dont know, I guess Im really, really trying to ensure that it gets disposed.  For example, taking my SetReportDatsSource function as an example.  I used using, but someone else may use the class and forget to add the using or call Dispose in some way.  Therefore, I go to my ReportData classp  precodepublic class ReportData  IDisposable      private DataSet1 mDS  null  Notice this disposable member variable     private bool mIsDisposed  false  This is new      public ReportData ... some parameters ...              mDS  new DataSet1          Plus some other manipulation on mDS            New code here up until the GetDataSet property     ReportData              Disposefalse           public void Dispose              Disposetrue         GC.SuppressFinalizethis           protected virtual void Disposebool disposing              if mIsDisposed  true                      return                   if mDS  null                      mDS.Dispose             mDS  null                   mIsDisposed  true            Done with new code      public DataSet1 GetDataSet              get                      return mDS                     Everything else is pretty much private.      This class is here to generate my DataSet  codepre  pNow, lets go back to the calling class, we still havep  precodeprivate void SetReportDataSource      using DataSet1 ds  mRptData.GetDataSet              mRpt.SetDataSourceds       codepre  pBut, I made ReportData mRptData disposable now too  So, we are going to want to dispose of that  And because its a member variable and I cant just use using in the way Im using it with SetReportDataSource, you start thinking about making this calling class IDisposable, so I can havep  precode    protected virtual void Disposebool disposing              if mIsDisposed  true                      return                   if mReportData  null                      mReportData.Dispose             mReportData  null                   mIsDisposed  true      codepre  pSo, now this class has the destructorfinalizer and its public Dispose method, disposing of ReportData.  Were guaranteed that we dispose of the DataSetp  pBut then again, this will result in DataSets Dispose method getting called twice.  Because the SetReportDataSource function disposes the exposed DataSet, and the ReportData class is also disposing the same thing and there is not an easy way to determine if someone disposed of the exposed DataSet.p  pSeems kind of nutty.  It looks like to me that Ip  pa May be overthinking this or just trying to be really defensive, which is goodp  pb Might be jumping through a bunch of hoops.p  pMaybe the rule should be If my class is going to expose it, the calling function should be responsible for disposing it.p  pThe only issue I see with that and thats why I posted herep  pIn between the time that ReportData member variable is instantiated, and SetReportDataSource is called, some errorexception may occur.  So, we never get a chance to do the using inside of SetReportDataSource on our DataSet.  But that dataset was constructed with ReportData and we want to call dispose on itp  pSo, now were back to making ReportData IDisposable, because we are going to at least need some public CleanUp function ... ok, Im done. p

Negative 15080 pI guess simple answer to the question would be a strongcomponentstrong.p  pAlthough I agree, I feel weird having to write a component for something so specific.p  pFor example, lets say I have a table of users. When a user is created, it should form a chain reaction of events, initiating different kinds of data related to the user all around the database. I figured it would be best to avoid directly manipulating the database from different controllers and instead pack all that neatly in a method. However since some logic needs to be accesed separately, I really cant have the whole package in a single method. Instead I thought it would be logical to break it up to smaller pieceslike codeuserModelOrControllergtcreateNewcode and codecandyStorageModelOrControllergtcreateNewcode that only interact with their respective database table.p  pNow, if the logic is put to the model, it works great until I need to use other models. Of course its possible, but when compared to loading models in a controller, its not that simple. Its like  a Cake developer telling me Sure, its possible if you want to do it that way but thats not how I would do it.p  pThen, if the logic is put to the controller, I can access other models really easy through codethisgtloadModelcode, but that brings me back to the previously explained situation since I need to be able to continue the chain reaction indefinitely. Accessing other controllers from a controller is possible, but again there doesnt seem to be any direct way of doing so, so Im guessing Im still not doing it right.p  pBy using a component this problem could be solved easily, since components are available to every controller I want. But like I wrote at the beginning, it feels awkward to create a component specifically for this one task. To me, components seem more like packages of extra functionalitylike the core components and not something to share controllerspecific logic.p  pSince Im new to this whole MVC thing, I couldve completely misunderstood the concept.

Negative 15080 pI have an Sql query that looks up a person based on SSN and returns the PersonID identity column. There is a index on the SSN column in the persons table.p  pI have an old VB 6 application that uses COM.NET interop to call this query. When it does it runs relatively slow. I set up a trace using SQL Profiler and each call has a duration between 400ms600ms. p  pIf I run the very same query via the query analyser, I get a duration lt 30ms. I also have a ASP.NET web site that makes the same exact call and get durations less than 30ms.p  pNormally I would suspect that the COM.NET interop overhead is creating the delay. However Im getting the trace times out of SQL Profiler. I cant see how overhead on the client side would effect the numbers Im getting out of a serverside database trace.p  pWhat else could be causing this issuep  pEDITp  pI discovered the issue. I setup sql profiler to capture the execution plan and discovered that when the stored procedure was called via the VB app, the execution plan wasnt using the index on SSN. However when the same SP was called via asp.net or QA, the proper index was called. I sent a sprecompile to the server, and from that point forward the VB app was running at adequate speed. p  pWhat I still dont understand, is why the VB app wasnt using the same cached query plan as the other clients.p

Negative 15080 pOften after a Drupal 6.x site is launched, I have people starting to sign up and enter their own content. Whenever there is need for an upgrade, the database on production is copied to dev and then the development is done on dev, later get pushed to staging for clients approval. p  pWhen the site is eventually ready to go live, there is a problem. Production server has the latest user inputted content, dev and staging have the latest functionality. Simply overwriting the database on production wont work. What I usually do is to write down what has been done to dev and than follow the steps to go though the implementations again on production. As the system grows bigger, one single mistake on production may cause lost of business. I cant shutdown the site for several hours. I cant tell how many people are using the site at a given time, even so its impossible to wait for a time where nobody is on the site to make the upgrade.p  pHas anyone have any good ideap  pThanks in advance.p

Negative 15080 pIm having a bit of a difficult time configuring the jquery UI.Layout plugin. It all seems straightforward when I read the docs but then ... things dont work.p  pIm using current version of the plugin 1.3.0 I believe, and google cdn 1.5.1 of jquery. And 1.8.10 for jquery ui, if that matters.p  pFirstly Im getting a popup when the page loadsp  pThe layoutcontainer DIVcontent has no height. Therefore the layout is 0height and hence invisiblep  pThat seems like a reasonable error message so I modified my css to give content height100 and cleared the browser cache but no, problem is still there.p  pSecond issue although the resizer bar is actually present I can see it in firebug, and interact with it as long as I know where it is at, it seems like there should be some matching css file with the library to style the resizer. The demos on the UI.Layout page however dont seem to have any css and they work fine For example, all I want is something like this, a hrefhttplayout.jquerydev.netdemosexample.htmlhttplayout.jquerydev.netdemosexample.htmla, and when I do view source theres no style or no css included.p  pWhat am I missingp

Negative 15080 pIm diving into Ruby on Rails and Im trying to build a basic web app from scratch to learn the platform and associated technologies.  So far, I only have it running on my local machine, but Id like to get it deployed to a free Heroku account to start getting familiar with deployment and testing the app on a live server.  Obviously I dont want the app to be publicly available to anyone since its far from finished and simply not ready for public use.  I suppose what Im trying to do is similar to a closed beta test, but since this is my first go around, I have no idea which direction I should go to accomplish this.p  pI have user accounts and authentication enabled. One thing I could do is toss up a static landing page that shows the site is under construction, and since I have a login URL, I could just add codebeforefiltercodes to all my controllers so that only I can login and access the site, but that feels hackish and doesnt let me properly test the pages that should be public because theyre private.  Do I at least have the right idea here  Or is my strategy way offp  pDoes Heroku have any built in support for keeping sites private until theyre ready to go publicp  pAny direction would help, thank you so muchp

Negative 15080 pI have extracted all my integration tests out of my multimodule setup and put them all into a separate project. These integration tests are based on spring and a use a real database. I am using dbmaintain which is a database versioning tool, it automatically tracks which SQL files need to be applied and keeps the database in a correct state.p  pWhat I would like is to be able to run the code that ensures the database is up to date before any test is run. So if you run all the tests from Eclipse or Maven in my case that it will first perform the db check once, or if you run a single test it will first perform the db check. No matter how many tests are run, it should always run the db check.p  pRight now I am thinking that I will use BeforeClass in the base test class all tests ultimately extend from this class which will instantiate a singleton to do its work. That singleton will control everything to make sure things only get run once. p  pI am hoping there is a cleaner way.p

Flat icon lighting comes from the upperleft at 130 degrees.      Smaller icons for example, 16x16 and 32x32 are simplified for readability.     However, if they contain a reflection within the icon often simplified,     they may have a tight drop shadow. The drop shadow ranges in opacity from     3050 percent.     Layer effects can be used for flat icons, but should be compared with other     flat icons. The shadows for objects will vary somewhat, according to what     looks best and is most consistent within the size set and with the other     icons in Windows Vista. On some occasions, it may even be necessary to     modify the shadows. This will especially be true when objects are laid over     others.     A subtle range of colors may be used to achieve desired outcome. Shadows help     objects sit in space. Color impacts the perceived weight of the shadow, and     may distort the image if it is too heavy.      Blend mode Multiply     Opacity 22 to 50  depends on color of the item.

I mean, if there are 1000 users on my site trying to save their invoice in PDF at the same time Is there a limit, how does it work I know that fpdf is a php class so I dont have to worry about this I only need the proper php.ini configuration I guess.p  pWhat would you suggest For small PDF documents but high performance to be able to handle a lot of requests at the same time.p  pAre there any other optionsp  pThank you for your helpp

However, this is only for running the whole test class  if I want to run an individual test, I have to recreate the run congfigurations for that test method. p  pAlso, those are IDE and box specific  so if I switch boxes I develop on multiple machines or one of my colleagues tries to run the tests, those settings are not transferred. Also, other IDEs like Eclipse and NetBeans are used by my colleagues. FWIW, were using mercurial for source code control.p  pFor the build cycle, were using Maven, so I know how to specify the JVM parameters for that.p  pSo  Im looking for a way of specifying the JVM parameters that will apply for the whole test class and the individual test methods and  Id like to share those specification across IDEs on any machine having picked up the code from the repository.p

Currently my development team access the web app, run their test cases and then SSH into my Linux boxes to view or get the logs.

For every directory that has a log they will need, I basically create an index.html file that only has a download link to that log file and then i start a SimpleHTTPServer in that directory.

Negative 15080 pI have a form with a System.Windows.Forms.NumericUpDown control.p  pSay that the range is from 0 to 100, and the current value arrived at via the spinner is 100.  I can type in a number that is outside of the allowable range say 567 but when I click OK on the form to reset the value, it just silently sets the out of range value to 100 and closes the form.p  pThe customer wants an explicit message that the number is out of range.  So, I looked at checking the codeNumericUpDown.Textcode property on the form close, but that property gives me back 100 not 567.p  pWhere or how can I catch the fact that the text appearing in the control is 567 p

Negative 15080 pI have seen the oddest behavior from JavaScript and would love some insight into what is causing this.  I made a little sudoku solver app code below, also available to see at wellsjohnston.comprojects, and part of it features a board generator.  When you click generate board or solve, jQuery is supposed to change the button to say Creating Random Board... or solving....  However, when they are clicked, nothing happens.  You would think it was simply not working  but that is not the case.  When I remove the code to change the button back ie, removing .submitsudokuboard.textsolve, it all of a sudden works, and changes when clicked but not back, of course.  Does anyone have any idea what is going on  p  pTLDRThe code seems to be executing asynchronously. While the solvingboard generating recursive functions are running, the rest of the script executes.

Negative 15080 pI am 13 years old and Ive started to develop iphone games in a program called stencylworks. It is very glitchy and Im tired of being limited by a game engine and think it would be a useful skill to learn how to program so I thought I would try and learn a framework cocos 2d, sparrow to make iphone games instead of using an engine. I have been using game engines since I was ten but whenever I try and teach myself a programming language it never goes well. I have almost no programming experience whatsoever and it seems that most frameworks assume you have knowledge of another language.Im willing to learn another language first if it will make everything a lot easier but I dont really want to. I have a lot of learning resources local library, itunesu so if theres any books to make learning easy I can get those too. Thanksp

Negative 15080 pHow would you implement a function that is returning a random number from interval 1..1000 in the case there is a number N determining the chance of reaching higher numbers or lower numbersp  pIt should behave as follows e.g.p  ul liif N  0 and we will generate many times the random number we will get a certain equilibrium every number from interval 1..1000 has equal chance.li liif N  2321 I call it positive factor it will be very hard to achieve small number often will be generated numbers  900, sometimes numbers near 500 and rarely numbers lt 100. The highest the positive factor the highest probability for high numbersli liif N  2321 negative factor this will be the opposite of positive factorli ul  pIts clear that the generated numbers will create for given N certain characteristic curve. Could you advise me how to achieve this goal and what curves can I create What possibilities do I have here How would you limit positive and negative factors etc.p  pthank you for helpp
Negative 15080 pIm using actsastree plugin for my user messaging thread feature on my website. I have a method that makes deleting selected messages possible. The messages dont actually get deleted. Their senderstatus or recipientstatus columns get set to 1 depending on what user is the sender or recipient of the message.p  pAnyway if both users have those statuss set to one then that last line makes sure the message  row is completely moved from the database. Now this is fine as long as its not the parent message being deleted. If the parent message deleted then the children that havent been selected for deletion wont be accessible anymore.p  pHere is the methodp  precode        def deleteallusersselectedmessagesmessageids, userid, parentid           Message.whereid gt messageids, senderid gt userid.updateallsenderstatus gt 1           Message.whereid gt messageids, recipientid gt userid.updateallrecipientstatus gt 1           Message.deleteallsenderstatus gt 1, recipientstatus gt 1, parentid gt parentid.whereid  , parentid         end codepre  pIts quite obvious what Im trying to do. I need to have the parent ignored. So where the primary key is equal to the parentid means that row is a parent normally the parentid is nil but I needed it set to the primary keys value for some other reason, long story and not important. Anyway is there an SQL statement I can add on to the end of the last line in tat method To make sure it only deletes messages where the id of the row is not equal to the parentidp  pI can arrange for the parentid row to never be permitted for deletion unless the actual thread MessageThreads table that references the messages tables conversations is deleted.p  pAny way how can I make it so this parent row is ignored when that deleteall method is runp  pKind regardsp

Negative 15080 pIm trying to use the Django ORM for a task that requires a codeJOINcode in SQL. I  already have a workaround that accomplishes the same task with multiple queries and some offDB processing, but Im not satisfied by the runtime complexity.p  pemFirst, Id like to give you a short introduction to the relevant part of my model. After that, Ill explain the task in English, SQL and inefficient Django ORM.emp  h2The Modelh2  pIn my CMS model, posts are multilanguage For each post and each language, there can be one instance of the posts content. Also, when editing posts, I dont codeUPDATEcode, but codeINSERTcode new versions of them.p  pSo, codePostContentcode is unique on codepostcode, codelanguagecode and codeversioncode. Heres the classp  precodeclass PostContentmodels.Model      contains all versions of a post, in all languages.      language  models.ForeignKeyLanguage     post  models.ForeignKeyPost            the Post object itself only     version  models.IntegerFielddefault0  contains slug and id.      further metadata and content left out      class Meta         uniquetogether  resource, language, version, codepre  h2The Task in SQLh2  pAnd this is the task strongId like to get a list of the most recent versions of all posts in each language, using the ORM.strong In SQL, this translates to a codeJOINcode on a subquery that does codeGROUP BYcode and codeMAXcode to get the maximum of codeversioncode for each unique pair of coderesourcecode and codelanguagecode. The perfect answer to this question would be a number of ORM calls that produce the following SQL statementp  precodeSELECT     id,      postid,      version,     v FROM     cmspostcontent,       SELECT          postid as p,          maxversion as v,          languageid as l      FROM          cmspostcontent      GROUP BY          postid,          languageid      as maxv WHERE      postidp      AND versionv      AND languageidl codepre  h2Solution in Djangoh2  pMy current solution using the Django ORM does not produce such a JOIN, but two seperate SQL queries, and one of those queries can become very large. I first execute the subquery the inner codeSELECTcode from abovep  precodemaxv  PostContent.objects.valuespost,language.annotate   maxversionMaxversion codepre  pNow, instead of joining codemaxvcode, I explicitly ask for every single post in codemaxvcode, by  filtering codePostContent.objects.allcode for each tuple of codepost, language, maxversioncode. The resulting SQL looks likep  precodeSELECT  FROM PostContent WHERE         postP1 and languageL1 and versionV1      OR postP2 and languageL2 and versionV2     OR ... codepre  pIn Djangop  precodefrom django.db.models import Q conjunc  maplambda pc Qversionpc[maxversion].and   Qpostpc[post].and   Qlanguagepc[language], maxv result  PostContent.objects.filter   reducelambda disjunc, x disjunc.orx, conjunc[1], conjunc[0] codepre  pIf codemaxvcode is sufficiently small, e.g. when retrieving a single post, this might be a good solution, but the size of the query and the time to create it grow linearly with  the number of posts. The complexity of parsing the query is also at least linear.p  pIs there a better way to do this, apart from using raw SQLp

Negative 15080 pSo, I need to make a repeating hexagonal pattern, using CSS. If images are needed, I can go there, but Id prefer to just use CSS if possible.p  pHeres an idea of what Im trying to createp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comuXKx1.png altenter image description herep  pBasically, I just need a way to create the hexagonal shapes, and then overlay textimages on top of them. I dont have much code yet, because Im not really sure where to start. The problem is, I could just use codeltdivgtcodes in the shape of a hexagon like shown in a hrefhttpcsstricks.comexamplesShapesOfCSShttpcsstricks.comexamplesShapesOfCSSa, but then they wouldnt be connecting. I could use a repeating hexagon pattern, but then I wouldnt be able to specify the exact location of the text or images I need in specific shapes. Thanks for any help in advance.p

Negative 15080 pId like to find the principal components of a data matrix X in Matlab by solving the optimization problem minXXBB, where the norm is the Frobenius norm, and B is an orthonormal matrix. Im wondering if anyone could tell me how to do that. Ideally, Id like to be able to do this using the optimization toolbox. I know how to find the principal components using other methods. My goal is to understand how to set up and solve an optimization problem which has a matrix as the answer. Id very much appreciate any suggestions or comments. p  pThanks MJp

Negative 15080 pI have jeditable fields that are updated by AJAX so am using strong.livestrong in conjunction with Jeditable to be able to persistantly bind the jeditable fields after AJAX update.

Negative 15080 pI have been trying for hours to fix this issue, I recently purchased IP.Nexus, an addon to the Invision Power Board forum softwareit is a shop front for the forum. There are two versions I may download, Zendguard locked, and Ioncube locked. I tried both, and I tried download the proper versions of both loaders. Little did I know that ioncube did not work on 64bit computers, and soon after figured out that Zendguard does not work on PHP server with thread safety enabledp  pQuestion is, how do I change the PHP version on wamp I understand that they have add ons to downgrade or upgrade but I believe that all of them are threadsafety enabled. I want to continue using wamp since I dont know how to use a different webserver. Thanks a bunchp

Negative 15080 pIm trying to use an external REST Library for my application, and Im hoping to keep it client side, with javascript. I have no control over the REST library servers, so I cannot modify any access rights or anything on the servers.

Using JSONP is not possible from what I gather, since I would only be able to do GETs and not POSTs, right Also, I dont know a lot about JSONP...does it perhaps require me to make some changes on the APIoffering server tooin which case I cant.p  pIs there a way to workaround this problem, or will I be forced to do some serverside programmingp

Negative 15080 pI frequently see this pattern in code, binding codesharedfromthiscode as the first parameter to a member function and dispatching the result using an codeasynccode function. Heres an example from another questionp  precodevoid ConnectionReceive       boostasioasyncreadsocket,boostasiobufferthisgtreadbuffer,         boostbindampConnectionhandleReceive,             sharedfromthis,            boostasioplaceholderserror,            boostasioplaceholdersbytestransferred   codepre  pThe only reason to use codesharedfromthiscode instead of codethiscode is to keep the object alive until the member function gets called. But unless theres some kind of boost magic somewhere, since the codethiscode pointer is of type codeConnectioncode, thats all codehandleReceivecode can take, and the smart pointer returned should be converted to a regular pointer immediately. If that happens, theres nothing to keep the object alive. And, of course, theres no pointer in calling codesharedfromthiscode.p  pHowever, Ive seen this pattern so often, I cant believe its as completely broken as it seems to me. Is there some Boost magic that causes the sharedptr to be converted to a regular pointer later, when the operation completes If so, is this documented somewherep  pIn particular, is it documented somewhere that the shared pointer will remain in existence until the operation completes Calling codegetpointercode on the strong pointer and then calling the member function on the returned pointer is not sufficient unless the strong pointer isnt destroyed until the member function returns.p

Negative 15080 pI was reading Introduction to GCC and it says if a package has both .a and .so. gcc prefer the shared library. By default the loader searches for shared libraries only in a predefined set of system directories, such as codeusrlocallibcode and codeusrlibcode.

Negative 15080 pI have written a drupal module. One of the functions in the module is a hook function which has a function name of the form hookformFORMIDalter, where the part FORMID depends on the the id of the form I want to alter. The form ids of the form I want to alter are stored in the database as persistent variables and what I want is to be able to use these to give the name of the function when I declare it. p  pMy form id array might change at any time, what hookformFORMIDalter does should be the same for each form, so I would like only the function name in the function definition to change depending on the content of the form id array. I tried googling for something like dynamic function definition, but this didnt seem to be what I was after.p  pI know I could easily use hookformalter and then simply check the id every time, but Id rather do it this way if its possible.p
Negative 15080 pI have inherited a project originally written for Win95 which has a number of buttons attached to a parent window derived from CWnd. The buttons themselves are in a userdefined class derived from CWnd, so they are not real buttons, but little windows that are defined by gazillions of lines of code, and have a ton of display issues that Ive been sweating over for several weeks, with no resolution in sight.p  pWe concluded the other day that CBitmapButton looked like a great alternative. Appears simple, define 4 bitmaps for the different button states. About all I need is BNCLICKED to fire up a handler, and Id be golden.p  pAfter messing around with this for a while, setting up a button and some bitmaps, I was able to display the CBitmapButton didnt look great, but I can fix that... the problem NOW is that I attempted to set up a message map to capture the BNCLICKED message, but since the parent window is derived from CWnd instead of CDialog, I get syntax errors setting up the message map. Read the MSDNs on the subject a few times over, and it appears you can only hook up a CBitmapButton to a CDialogderived class. This seems pretty weird to me  I just want a button, and it should be able to transmit a simple I was clicked to whatever parent its attached to, but apparently not destined to happen.p  pSo, has anyone successfully attached a CBitmapButton to a CWndderived parent and if so how does one set up a message map that will work with these things Alternatively, what approach would you use to set up a button class that WOULD work with a CWnd parent, since CBitmapButton and CButton seem to require CDialogs as parentsp

Negative 15080 pI am designing a data warehouse for sale reporting system and have problem with updatable saleplan data.

Negative 15080 pIm working on a streaming SOAPproxy that will be used for authentication and routing. Proxy must read and validate credentials and routing information from the SOAP header. It also must enrich the SOAP header with additional metadata that is consumed by the target services. p  pI first wrapped up a quick proof of concept using StAX XMLStreamReader and XMLStreamWriter. It seemed to work without issues, so concept was proven, but performance was not what I was exepcting. While profiling the prototype I noticed that application spent considerable amount of cpu time on character encodingdecoding 3080p  pI thought the solution would be simplep  ul liStore data read by XMLStreamReader from InputStream to a bufferli liGet the offset right before SOAP headers end tag getLocationli liSend data from buffer until offset is reachedli liSend additional datali liSend remaining data from bufferli liSend data from InputStreamli ul  pThis would avoid all the unneccessary encodingdecoding. However to my surprise, I found that standard implementation does not support getLocation  it returns 1.p  pObsolete section  following does NOT actually work because XMLStreamReader consumes ridiculous amounts of memory when reading a byte at time. I noticed that I can get the offset from InputStream, if I write a InputStreamReader that returns one byte at a time and tracks number of bytes read. This however doesnt feel like the right solution  absurd number of read calls will most likely cause greater performance hit than the extra decodingencoding. p  pWhat are my options here, if writing custom parser is out of the question Is there a standard compliant XMLStreamReader implementation that is both proven and supports the getLocationp

Negative 15080 pI got an annoying question why is it when I first attempted to compile this code with the variables imageSize and memorySize declared immediately under CameraPhone class compiler gave me a logic error but works perfectly when I declare the variables at the end of the code p  pAssume the existence of a Phone class. Define a subclass, CameraPhone that contains two instance variables an integer named, imageSize, representing the size in megapixels for simplicity assume a pixel takes up one byte thus megapixels equals megabytes of each picture i.e., 2 means each image is composed of 2 megapixels, and an integer named memorySize, representing the number of gigabytes in the cameras memory i.e., 4 means 4 Gigabyes of memory. There is a constructor that accepts two integer parameters corresponding to the above two instance variables and which are used to initialize the respective instance variables. There is also a method named numPictures that returns as an integer the number of pictures the cameras memory can hold. Dont forget that a gigabyte is 1,000 megabytes.p  precodepublic class CameraPhone extends Phone        public CameraPhoneint imageSize, int memorySize           this.imageSize   imageSize          this.memorySize  memorySize             public int numPictures          return memorySize  1000  imageSize            private int imageSize private int memorySize   codepre

Negative 15080 pFirst let me explain. My platform is mostly Windows and my data mostly resides in a relational database SQL Server 2008. I primarily work with C but occasuionally work with PERL and JavaScript. I was looking to learning what a graph database could do for my data but there seems to be a continual stream of tools and utilities that are not available that I need to install and learn. I am so busy learning the tools that I loose focus of what I really want and that is to work with a graph database.  It seems that Neo4j is relatively small and should be accessible to evaluate its features. I would like to import my data from an existing SQL database into Neo4J with the relationships established initially via the foreign keys. The idea seems relatively straightforward but it seems I need to learn Java, PHP, etc. not only to access Neo4J but also to access the existing database. I was wondering if anyone had some recommendations, tools, documentation that would accomplish this goal fairly simply. Do I do down the route of PHP Java What additional librariespackages do I need What tools are most useful Thank you.p

Negative 15080 pOkay, so I have a C project that uses SFML, and I want to be able to compile it from the CMD using MinGW.  I have it so I can compile.cpps, however, I just need to know what more I have to do in order for it to work with SFML.  I tried compiling it with CodeBlocks and MinGW, and it works fine, until I try to run it, at which point it tells me that sfmlsystem.dll is missing from my computer.

Negative 15080 pSee for yourself. I cant figure out if its even possible to get rid of that weird colored border. The point of this code is to be able to rotate an image and change the color of it at the same time. The way the code is, the color and angle of the image can easily be coded to be dynamic. This code uses a png image that is white, but has a transparency layer in the shape of the paw print. This way when you edit the background color, it changes the color of the image. It would work great if it were not for the weird border that gets added to the image... notice if you remove the rotate functionality, there is no annoying border.p  pIncluding JQuery 1.8.2, here is the HTMLCSS codep  pCSSp  precode.image  display inlineblock marginleftauto marginrightauto backgroundcolor blue   transform rotate30deg    codepre  pHTMLp  precodeltspan classicongtltspangt codepre

Negative 15080 pThe page in question is essentially a grid of images, always three across no matter the size of the window.p  pThe images are coming from Wordpress posts, and each one has its own container div with overflowhidden. The container divs are set in css to width 33.33. I am using jQuery on ready and window resize to set the height of the container divs equal to their width.p  pThe htmlphp structure looks like thisp  precodeltdiv classcollectionPostContainergt                     ltdiv classcollectionImageHoldergt                         ltimg srcltphp thefieldphoto gtgt                     ltdivgt ltdivgt codepre  pThe js function looks like thisp  precode  function resizeEntryHeight windowWidth  window.width .collectionPostContainer.eachfunction     this.cssheight,this.width  codepre  pp  pThe problem is that when the page first loads, the first four entries each get assigned a slightly higher height than the following entries, throwing off the grid at the third row. As soon as I call the function in the console or on window resize again, the heights get fixed and are all equal.p  pTested on Firefox and Chrome, at multiple starting window sizes. Oddly, the first four entries always get a height exactly 5px higher than the later entries.p  pSo I am wondering why elements with ostensibly the same width are being assigned different heights within the same loop, and how I can make my pretty image grid.p  pHope this is clearp  pThanks.p

Negative 15080 pIm really very new to Spring AOP. In my application, I had configured a hrefhttpstatic.springsource.orgspringdocs3.1.xjavadocapiorgspringframeworkwebfilterHiddenHttpMethodFilter.html relnofollowcodeHiddenHttpMethodFiltercodea that converts method parameters into HTTP methods and enables Spring to handle other HTTP methods like codeDELETEcode, codePUTcode etc including codeGETcode and codePOSTcode.p  pIt is some times necessary to disable this functionality especially when handling multipart requests. In order to disable it at a specific request regarding mulripart, I was using the following code.p  precodepackage resolver  import javax.servlet.http.HttpServletRequest import org.aspectj.lang.ProceedingJoinPoint import org.aspectj.lang.annotation.Around import org.aspectj.lang.annotation.Aspect import org.aspectj.lang.annotation.Pointcut import org.springframework.util.Assert import org.springframework.web.multipart.MultipartResolver     Disables the spring multipart resolver for specific client requests and   therefore keeps the request intact so that controllers can process it in   whatever way they wish. This behaviour is triggered by a particular GET   parameter in the client request so it is configurable.   see MultipartResolver   Aspect public final class MultipartResolverDisablingAspect             GET parameter which, if present in request, enables advice.           private static final String DISABLINGHTTPREQUESTPARAMETERKEY  multipartResolverDisable      private static boolean disablingParameterExistsfinal HttpServletRequest request               Assert.notNullrequest         return request.getParameterDISABLINGHTTPREQUESTPARAMETERKEY  null                  If above GET parameter exists in request then prompt the spring multipart       resolver to always tell spring that request is not of type multipart.

Negative 15080 pIve got 3 different tables and I need to pull data once from 2 of them, and twice from the third. The tables are codejobscode, codecustomerscode, and codecustomersattributescode.

One row for PhoneNumber, and another row for CustomerInfo. I used an INNER JOIN for one of them, but because I cant put WHERE values for both, I used a subquery for the other one.

Negative 15080 pi am facing the following problem. I would like to implement the approach of CI with jenkins into my Project. The project is written in C.  I have an ubuntu server v. 12.0.4.2 LTS. The idea is to run subversion and Jenkins on this Machine, while i am not sure, whether i understand the technical part correct.

So my question is Can i run subversion and Jenkins on the same machine If this is the case, i would really appreciate some advice. p  pUntil now i have installed Jenkins, which is working. I have also installed subversion, but because i am kinda new to linux, i dont know whether my SVN is working correctly.

Jenkins is monitoring this Directory and starts the buildtests after a commit happened.

Negative 15080 pI have an urge to detect when a user leaves my site in order to record accurately the session length of the user in question. I have thought of a couple possible solutions for thisp  pI first thought I could use onbeforeunload and send a simple ajax to record the last activity but what practice has shown me is that onbeforeunload is unreliable for now and its a bad idea to use it since its not cross browser.p  pThen I thought I could use cookies to record the users session length, respectively increase the cookie value every time a user has shown activity. The problem here is that I cannot detect which would be the users last activity and the only possible way I can safely insert the session length and know its accurate is when the user hasnt logged in for quite some time and the cookies value would be the last session length. This wouldnt be suitable for me because many users may just open the site once and never visit it again  for example , then none of those users would be recorded.p  pDoes anyone have a solution for this issue I seem to have searched but none of the answers I found were satisfying.p  pThank you in advancep

I have a interface to upload the file excel file, so the PHP program can read it...  p  p...but my boss job isnt make my life easier, is it NO He says that is a lot of work have to upload every excel file by the web interface. So, he asked me to make a button in the sheet that he might click after his job is done. That would replace the web interface.  But, the system itself is a interface that would be saled one day well, its the plan. So, I just cant just role out the web interface. p  pWHAT IM ASKING IS Theres a way that I could send a file the sheet itself in a post method straight from the VBA Macro without using XML files and name each data that Im sending, like a form post  p  pSo far, Ive found some tutorials or even some SO posts that made me get somewhere. But all of them were talking about a XML, and I already have a method that receives a HTTP POST from a form and work. I aiming to reuse the same method.

I have that query workingp  precodedb.runCommand       group      ns activities,     keyf functiondoc        var created  doc.id.getTimestamp       created.setHours0, 0, 0, 0        return  created created, user doc.user.id      ,     reduce function curr, result           We only need the first activity of the day, but we cant sort can we       var earliestSoFar  result.date  new Date        if earliestSoFar gt curr.id.getTimestamp          result.id  curr.id         result.date  curr.id.getTimestamp            ,     cond        type  B     ,     initial      codepre  pI was thinking I could then get the ids from that result collection and run a final query of the formp  precode.find or [    type A ,    id  in getListOfIdsFromGroupQuery  ].limit20 codepre  pI believe this will give me the results I want, but what Im afraid of isp  ol liThe group query will return me a list of every first B activityuserday.  Im only showing 20 activities at a time, so I only care about the 20 most recent B activities at most, since im showing 20 A amp B combined.  This seems really wasteful.li liOn the first query, I can trim the array that I pass to in down to 20 ids.  However, because the user can view the next page, I have to pass in 40 ids for the 2nd page, 60 for the 3rd page, etc.  By the 10th page, my in query is looking for 200 records.  Not sure if this is a problem, but it worries me.li ol  pIs there a better way to approach this  Hopefully its clear, I know its kind of a confusing situation.p

Negative 15080 pI have an SQL table in SQLite3 in which I am trying to aggregate information from several other tables, and records in one table may or may not have a corresponding record in another table. My query is supposed to include in the aggregate table both records with and without linked information. For examplep  precode            CREATE TABLE allhouseholds AS                 SELECT pop.uid AS popuid,                        pop.surname,                        pop.given,                        pop.age,                        pop.realproperty,                         farm.uid AS farmuid,                        farm.improvedacres,                        farm.unimprovedacres,                        farm.cashvalue,                        farm.corn,                        farm.cotton                         FROM pop, farm                        WHERE pop.farmid  farm.uid codepre  pThis is looking at data from census schedules. Everybody in the census will have the basic codepopcode information  surname, given name, value of real property  but not everybody has a farm. Only certain individuals have a value in the codefarmidcode column on codepopcode, corresponding to the record of that persons farm on codefarmcode otherwise codefarmidcode is NULL.p  pBut naturally, the above query will fetch only those individuals for whom codepop.farmid  farm.uidcode  that is, who have farms, and have values for codefarmidcode. The farmless individuals are excluded, and I want to include them, with empty values for the relevant codefarmcode columns in codeallhouseholdscode.p  pNow, I know I could solve this, and have so far, with separate SELECT statements for each linked column, like sop  precode            CREATE TABLE allhouseholds AS                 SELECT uid AS popuid,                        surname,                        given,                        age,                        realproperty,                         SELECT uid FROM farm WHERE pop.farmid  farm.uid AS farmuid,                        SELECT improvedacres FROM farm WHERE pop.farmid  farm.uid AS improvedacres,                        SELECT unimprovedacres FROM farm WHERE pop.farmid  farm.uid AS unimprovedacres,                        SELECT cashvalue FROM farm WHERE pop.farmid  farm.uid AS cashvalue,                        SELECT corn FROM farm WHERE pop.farmid  farm.uid AS corn,                        SELECT cotton FROM farm WHERE pop.farmid  farm.uid AS cotton                         FROM pop codepre  pBut this seems terribly clunky and inelegant. So, I wondered if there was a way to make the first query above pick up entries from codepopcode where codefarmidcode was NULLp  precode            WHERE pop.farmid  farm.uid OR pop.farmid IS NULL codepre  pBut then things went very haywire, and Im not sure why. In my real, unsimplified query, Im actually dealing with four tables, each with a column on codepopcode that may be a value or may be NULL, and though the first query above as written took only seconds, the query with this WHERE hung. Forever. And when I came back, it had died with the error that database or disk is full. So whatever I did, I seem to have elicited some kind of endless loop. I tried alternatelyp  precode            WHERE CASE WHEN pop.farmid IS NOT NULL THEN pop.farmid  farm.uid ELSE 1 END codepre  pBut this had the same result as before. Can anybody shed any light on what Im doing wrong, or what I might do better Thanks.p

Negative 15080 pI have 1 RabbitMQ Connection, 10K publishing Channels, 10K consuming Channels and 100 Threads. All channels are in rapid publishconsume loops using exclusive queues and external synchronization no possibility of publish, consume or close happening simultaneously on a channel. Closing channels simultaneously on 100 threads incurs a  delay of 2.5 seconds for each of the first 100 channels. All subsequent closures are processed in less than 0.5 seconds. If I bump it up to 20K20K channels the initial 100 each take 5 seconds to close. With 30K30K each takes 10 seconds, where were pretty much at the channelmax for a connection. Similarly if I reduce the number of threads to 50 then its the first 50 channels that close slowly.p  pLet me restate that... strongWith 30K30K channels the first 100 each take 10 seconds to close using 100 simultaneous threads. The remaining 59,900 each take less than 0.5 seconds.strong My feeling is that theres some funky connectionwide synchronizationcontinuation going on here. Hit the connection up with 100 channelclose requests on 100 threads simultaneously and it baulks. Whatever causes that initial spasm doesnt seem to affect subsequent close operations and everything swims along nicely.p  pIve tried ramping up the number of connections to relieve the pressure. This certainly works with predictable results. With 30K30K connections spread evenly over 2 connections the initial 100 channelclose delays are halved from 10 seconds to 5 seconds. Use 10 connections and the delay is imperceptible when compared to the subsequent 59,900 channel closures. Jump to 50K50K channels we can do this with 10 connections but not 1 connection due to channelmax and the delays start to creep back in again.p  pMy concerns with this approach are that 1 multiple connections are discouraged in the documentation due to io resource overhead and that 2 its not clear for my application how to sensibly predict the optimum number of channels per connection. If there is a soft limit to the number of channels per connection why is it not documented or made available in the api If I have to manage a number of connections and allocate channels across those connections in a robust manner I feel like Im doing the work of a client libraryp  pIve tried my hand at modifying the client library by not waiting for channelclose acknowledgements from the RabbitMQ server. This worked like a charm. Channels were closed instantly with no delay in the client and confirmed as closed on the server. Eight hours later though and I was out of heap space as the channel resources internal to the client library were not being released. I havent managed to isolate the source of the delay either... is it in the client library or the server itself To progress further Id need to trace the wire protocol. I think Im off track with this approachp  pstrongQuestionsstrongp  pBefore making application changes Id like to know if this is a known issue with the Java client Are there better workarounds than multiple connections and applicationlevel channel management In practise my actual application uses around 20K channels per process, which I dont feel is excessive, and message throughput is actually pretty light as Im leveraging RabbitMQ more for the routing. I could even live with the delays but theyre already noticeable. I could refactor to use less channels but then Id be sharing channels and would either have to synchronize their usage or ignore documentation guidelines. The error handling paradigm makes this cumbersome though any channel error results in its termination so its difficult to isolate errors, prevent them from permeating and recover in a robust manner.p  pstrongDetailstrongp  pRabbitMQ server 3.1.5, Java amqpclient 3.1.5. Also tried 3.1.4, 3.1.3 in the same test harness and seen what I assume to be exactly the same behaviour in 3.0 and prior in production application. p  pMy test harness is standalone but a bit obtuse to post here. I create 10K test clients each of which creates an exclusive queue and runs a continuous publishconsumepublishconsume loop. The publisher and consumer each have their own channels. Im using channel.basicConsume with DefaultConsumers and a default consumer executor service. Also used my own Java executor service, which appears to be the same as the default implementation, with various numbers of threads to no discernible effect.p  pMessages consumed in handleDelivery spawn a new publish task via a java.concurrent fixed thread pool, so the consumer thread is not tied up or used in any channel operations whatsoever. The channelclose is synchronized so that it cannot happen at the same time as a publish. However theres nothing stopping a consume happening while close is being processed  the consumer is out of my control.p  pThanks for any pointersp
Negative 15080 pI am implementing a small blocks stacking game in opengl with c.

Negative 15080 pRecently, I was working in our codebase on a bug where I found that looking up a value in a HashMap by String produced the correct result whereas looking up a value by GStringImpl using key produced an incorrect null result.

My question is why do String and GStringImpl not produce the same hashCode and not produce a true result when equals... is used  Is this a bugdesign error  Or was this done for a reason  It seems the results of these methods should be compatible since interactions between these classes are supposed to be seamless to the programmer. The result of this is a huge potential for mistakes in code that might seem intuitive at first but results in a bug in map lookups.p  pThanks,p  pChrisp

Negative 15080 pIm using the REST API V2. Ive successfully used the API to created an envelope from a document. In the request body, I embedded a document and json data for a recipient.  I then used the API to embed the sender page Embedded Sending View inside our website.  However, it initializes to the tagging screen.  The user can click the Go Back link to go to the first screen in the process but I would like to start them off on that screen.  p  p1 Is that possible If so, howp  p2 Also, its my understanding that we can removehide the Documents for Signature  and Envelope Settings sections from the first screen.  How is that accomplishedp  pI have screenshots but am unable to attach them to this post because I do not have a 10 reputation this is my first post.  I can email them to you directly if thats helpful.p
Negative 15080 pI have a project which uses stronglibcurl.all.astrong. It builds, links and runs perfectly on Xcode 4.6.3. But in Xcode5, it throws linker errors on undefined symbols.

Therefore, the answer Im looking for lies into the followingp  h2How to modify the result of getBounds to be used for fitBounds without zoom effect afterwardsh2  pBasically, Im quite sure this can be calculated because thats what the map does, but in the opposite direction, when adding margins, to show the given bounds completely. In these terms, tell me how to calculate the margins and therefore, how to calculate the correct input for codefitBoundscode having output from codegetBoundscode and your answer will be accepted.p  pThanks in advancep  h2Updateh2  pZoom and Center retrieval and setting does not work for me heres the reason whyp  pI am going to hold the maps viewport information in the database. Later on, I want to recreate the map and show the exact same location again. However, the mapping platform can differ from user to user. Therefore, zoom and center is not standard between different mapping platformsframeworks and cannot be used in all them with the same results. Therefore, the only standard way is to hold the bounds in the database. So the question needs an answer exactly in the direction it is asking for.p

Negative 15080 pIm a beginner in Kinect Programming. Yet I read different tutorials and texts about it. Furthermore I was working on the code examples Controls BasisWPF. Unfortunately none of the sources teach me how to code grabbing and releasing in a way that I understand. p  pI would like to create dynamically KinectTileButtons. While the program is running the user should be able to place the buttons to the positions he prefers. The player uses his hand as the cursor. For example There is a button b1 on the top left corner.  While the hand of the user is not on b1, the button doesnt change his position.  If the users hand is on the button AND he makes the GRABgesture, the position of the button is like the position of his hand variable position. When he RELEASES, the position of button is constant and will not change until the user is grabbing for the button the next time. p  pIm very thankful for any advices, suggestions or code examples, because I really dont know how I should continue to work on this problem. p  pThanks in advance  derpatep

Negative 15080 pI know this is a long shot, but Im all out of ideas.p  pBasically, I have a Motorola TC55 that needs to mail a .pdf file from a TempTale 4 USB connected by USB to the device.p  pThe app itself is already working great, so no issues there, but heres the catch. When the TempTale 4 is connected for the first time, it displays the files in the udisk directory so everything works great, but if I disconnect the TempTale and reconnect it the udisk directory stays empty.p  pThe phone doesnt recognise the TempTale as a USB device when connecting the second time and instead displays a message along the lines of the SD card can now be safely removed as soon as the TempTale is connected. Ive looked everywhere but the files are nowhere to be found.p  pThe only thing that helps is rebooting the TC55, which is a real pain in the ass if youre going to have to do that every time before being able to upload the temperature statistics.p  pIts running Android 4.1.2 and its a company phone so I cant root it to try some coded unmounting magic to see if that helps.p  pAny help or ideas on how to solve this would be greatly appreciated, because Im baffled by this strange behaviour.p

Negative 15080 pI have used switchtoggle inside ngrepeat. I dont know how to set default value to ngmodel when you have multiple switchtoggle in your form and on form submit you need to have all the values. I am very much new to angular world and here is the a hrefhttpplnkr.coeditUOgojyLNY87TXNLNxqH5ppreview relnofollowExamplea In this example on form load the default value for switchtoggle is shown as OFF. And if I submit form without making any change to the switchtoggle and check in  browser console you can see empty model array. And on making some changes then I get the appropriate values.br So, how can I get all the values of the switchtoggle irrespective I make changes or not. As far as my angularJS knowledge is concern I guess it is related to its model. But how to do it in this case I feel I am lost. p

Here it is important to note that I cannot just count seconds rather, the program must know the value of the second of the current time and output the corresponding character only if it is divisible by 10.p  pRestrictionsp  p1 The program can have 2 classes  one for the minute display and one for the second display.p  p2 Each class can contain only one void method that takes a timer as a parameter.p  p3 The main function will create an object of each class and 2 NSTimers. strongThe first timer must have its interval set at 0.5 and must target the minutes object. The second timer must have its interval set at 0.1 and must target the seconds object.strongp  pI would love to just set the first time to fire every minute and the second timer to fire ever second, but I am not allowed to tamper with that.

Negative 15080 pI am developing on a prestashop website that has two js scripts that are executed at the same time, when the document is ready. Both are ajax petitions. My problem is that the user I use to connect to the database has a maximun of one connection at the same time and,as both scripts are executed at the same time, it always throws an exception.p  pI was wondering if there is some way to make an script way until there are not petitions to the server. I mean, making the second script wait until the first one has finished its job.p  pIt would be great if I could do this without having to change the first one, as its a default script of Prestashop.p  pThank you beforehand p

Negative 15080 pIve installed CKFinder on a website Im developing and so far its working pretty good. I have a documents page that has a standalone instance of CKFinder for managing files in all subfolders. However, I also have a product management page that allows a user to add imagesfiles to a product listing with a CKFinder popup. When clicking browse next to an input field, it opens a CKFinder popup and points to the appropriate subfolder.p  pThis is working great However, I was wondering if it was possible to hide the folder pane inside the popup so that the user cannot accidentally choose the wrong subfolder. I see that CSS can be modified to hide the pane altogether, but I would like to be able to still use it from the main documents page.p  pIs this possiblep

Negative 15080 pI created an application that uses MediaRecorder, it creates a file in my application directory and records into it, it worked fine.

However, I am experiencing huge differences in calculation time when applying the two methods to recalculate a geometry field.p  pIn the examples below, the pointgeoms.pointwithin field is a geometry type field of the same type and SRID as POINTS.geomp  pFor example, this WHERE version runs almost instantly on the subset of 5k recordsp  precodeUPDATE POINTS SET geom  pointgeoms.pointwithin FROM pointgeoms WHERE POINTS.POINTID  pointgeoms.pointid codepre  pWhile this INNER JOIN version will just keep spinning on and on, even when asked to only calculate a single rowp  precodeUPDATE POINTS SET geom  p.pointwithin FROM POINTS s INNER JOIN pointgeoms p ON s.POINTID  p.pointid codepre  pWhen I SELECT based on the very same INNER JOIN, it returns all 5k records in the subset rather quickly.. which confuses me more as to why the INNER JOIN update is just spinning on and on.  When I EXPLAIN the select version, it looks like its only scanning the 5k rows in the pointgeoms table, however when updating it looks like it wants to scan all 1M in the POINTS table.p  pAny thoughts  explanations would be greatly appreciated.  Perhaps Ive just done something silly here.  Either way, would really like to understand whats going on.  Thank you in advancep

Negative 15080 pIve just written part of a generator, and reached the point where it functions correctly, but needs some refactoring. The structure of the method is as followsp  precodepublic function getFlattenedList array elements       foreach  elements as element           if  thisgtsomeCondition element                 A pile of stuff here              if  anotherCondition                   for  i  0 i lt thisgtsomeValue i                       yield thisgtanotherOperation element                                                 else              yield thisgtsomeOperation element                 codepre  pThis method is to bigcomplex. The most obvious thing to do is move out the body of the if branch to its own method. Something like thisp  precodepublic function getFlattenedList array elements       foreach  elements as element           if  thisgtsomeCondition element                              thisgtgetFlattenedElement element                   else              yield thisgtsomeOperation element                  private function getFlattenedElement       A pile of stuff here      if  anotherCondition           for  i  0 i lt thisgtsomeValue i               yield thisgtanotherOperation element                 codepre  pBut of course I cannot just return the result of this new function, since it also is a generator. And I want it to be a generator, so the work is only done when the value is requested. What I did to make this work is adding yet another loop, inside the body of the if conditionp  precodepublic function getFlattenedList array elements       foreach  elements as element           if  thisgtsomeCondition element                foreach  thisgtgetFlattenedElement element  as flattened                   yield flattened                               else              yield thisgtsomeOperation element                 codepre  pIs it somehow possible to avoid having to add that loop, while keeping the generator behaviour and splitting up the method nicely Ive not used generators before, so might be missing something obvious.p

Negative 15080 pBackground Im trying to develop an application and Im not quite sure of the java technologies I need to look into. The basic outline of my problem is thisp  pLets say that Im developing an application that programmatically watches something lets call it a football game. I want to create any number of algorithms that read that thing lets say theyre football passes which I assume Ill run as threads in the main process so that many can run simultaneously. I want those algorithms to spit out events which Im assuming I want to create as POJOs  extending the java event class that get published to a generic pubsub manager. I then want some algorithms again, threads that can subscribe to events theyre interested in possibly multiple ones and then act upon them such as totalling the number of forward passes by a team.p  pQuestion I feel like this is a combination of the java concepts Ive described above threads running in a process, producing objects based on a class that extends the EventObject class but, am I right in thinking that I do pubsub through JMSp  pCheersp

Negative 15080 pI have a view with code constantcode height constraint and a fixed width constraint. Inside it, I have a text view with leadingtrailingtopbottom constraints to that outer view, effectively being docked inside that view just with a few point margins. I have my text views vertical content compression resistance priority set to 750, and it resizes itself depending on the text content. It grows when I go to second line, shrinks when I delete a line etc. However, I want that growshrink to be animated.

Ive put a breakpoint inside those methods, and they are not called at all. Apparently, layout change happens at a lower level. How can I animate the growth and shrinking of my view One option is to disable content compression resistance priority, calculate the height of my text view on text change, then set the height attribute manually, and to animate there. But I dont want to go with that if there is a cleaner solution that involves dynamicautomatic resizing using content compression resistance. Is there a solutionp

What is the correct way of doing this with matrixtoolkitsjava  I tried the following code but it seems to run forever and my own implementation was much faster.p  precode    DenseMatrix tmpMatrix  new DenseMatrix30000, 10000      read in matrix values from another object using tmpMatrix.set       this is supposed to save some memory altough my matrix is not very sparse     CompColMatrix matrixA  new CompColMatrixtmpMatrix     CompColMatrix matrixB  new CompColMatrixnew DenseMatrixmatrixA      CompColMatrix matricC  new CompColMatrixnew DenseMatrix30000, 30000      matrixB.transpose       multiply matrices     matrixA.multmatrixB, matrixC codepre  pThere is not much documentation for this libary so I dont know how to initialize a  CompColMatrix directly or how to exploit the fact that matrixB is essentially matrixB transposed so that I wouldnt even need a new matrix in this case ...p  pEDIT  I should also add that the resulting matrix C is symetric and that I can use a symetric matrix type for the result but nevertheless the whole process is very slowp

Negative 15080 pI have an app with two targets, for iPhone and for iPad.p  pThis project is not using size classes.p  pOn the iPhone version I have a storyboard that contains a viewController called termsAndConditions. This viewController has class files termsAndConditions.h and .m.p  pInside termsAndConditions.m I have an outlet linked to a textView on the viewController.p  pThen I have the second target for iPad. I have the same viewController there called termsAndConditions. My idea was to use the same class files termsAndConditions.h and .m from the iPhone version with this other target. But there is a problem.p  pRemember that the outlet is pointing to the textView on the viewController of the iPhone storyboard When I assign the iPad termsAndConditions viewController to use the same iphone class files, it apparently works, but when I try to access the textView on the iPad version nothing happens. On the other hand, when I pass the mouse over the outlet on the implementation, textViews on both viewControllers, on both storyboards, highlight.p  pApparently the class file outlet is really linked to both textViews on different storyboards, but this appears to be fake.p  pIs there a way to do that or will I have to duplicate the termsAndConditions.h and .m with another name to use on the iPad storyboard This appears to be a stupid solution.p  pthanks.p

Negative 15080 pSuppose I have an executable Alpha, which must link with a shared library Beta. Beta itself is dependent on shared library Gamma. Gamma already exists for me, but I must compile Alpha and Beta myself, using cmake.p  pSo, with the two CMakeLists.txt files, one for each of Alpha and Beta, I use the command codetargetlinklibrariescode to indicate which libraries are needed for compilation.

Negative 15080 pSo I am very skilled with ExcelAccess VBA. I new to writing code that manipulates .pdf files. What I want to do is be able to use the built in text recognition software in adobe pdf pro, then search the page for a specific word say File NO 12321 then use File NO 12321 string to separate a specific number of pages until File NO 12322 comes along and separate them out again. While using File NO 12321 as a file name for the first separated binder, so on and so forth.... I was wondering if there was VBA Excel commands that I could use to pull the text from the .pdf and then send commands though windows to do the page separation The file renaming can be done via Excelcmd promp that is easy part, because once the text recognition software was done you can controlA and controlV to get the text into a cell I don not know the code to pull the text from there it is simple in excel to find the string characters I am looking for just a basic loop function. If this is not possible is there another language I need to use like java and if so where would I start as I am not privy to that code language. p

Negative 15080 pI am about to release a Python library Ive been working on the past few weeks. Ive read a lot about Python dependencies but something is not quite clear yetp  pSome people pretend you should strongneverstrong pin your dependencies versions as it would prevent the users of your library from upgrading those dependencies.p  pSome other claim that you should strongalwaysstrong pin your dependencies versions as it is the only way of guaranteeing that your release works the way it did when you developped it and to prevent that a breaking change in a dependency wreaks havoc in your library.p  pIm somehow went for an hybrid solution, where I assumed my dependencies used a hrefhttpsemver.org relnofollowsemantic versioning a and pinned only the major version number say codesomelib gt 2.3.0, lt 3code except when the major version number is code0code semantic versioning dictates that such versions are to be considered volatile and may break the API even if only the patch number is bumped.p  pAs of now, Im not sure which way is the best. Is there an official guideline even a PEP perhaps  that dictates the best practice regarding Python dependencies and how to specify them p

The general consensus seems to be that the scripting.Dictionary class is the VBA equivalent of associative arraysdictionarieshashtables in other languages.p  pThe one thing I dont like the look of though is that the only way I can see of retrieving the value associated with a given key is to use the .items property either explicitly, or via scripting.Dictionarykey. But rather than doing anything to indicate the issue if key is not in use in the dictionary, it adds it.p  pI know I can use a if structure with .exists being the test to achieve the same functionality, and can write my own function that raises an error if the exists test fails, but it seems a lot of stuffing around to achieve what is core functionality in Python raises KeyError, PHP raises a Notice, Java Maps return null  although that is not necessarily ideal in the case of HashMaps where null actually is a valid value  but it does work as an indicator for HashTables.p  pSo is there any way of attempting to retrieve a value by key that will do something ideally throw an error if the key is not in use, rather than silently adding it Google hasnt provided any answers  but maybe Im just not phrasing the search well.p

Negative 15080 pI have spent over a month now looking for a solution on how to transmit live camera stream from a metro app to a publishing server which I implemented in form of a web socket ashx handler. Apparently, all resources I have found online states that I cannot get access to the live camera frames with c, it was said that this could only be achieved with native C. p  pI wrote a hack to override the WriteAsync method IRandmomAccessStream class in the Windows.Storage.Streams namespace. I believe this method gets called each time a new sequence of bytes is to be written from the recording camera to the stream buffer. I overrode this write method to send those sequence of bytes to the manually created web socket server which worked fine but the video was always corrupted at the receiving end.p  pI believe this is due to some missing metadatafragmented frames as the stream is in h.264. I want to ask if anyone has an idea of a library that can transcode the camera feed in realtime for live streaming in pure c.  p

How can I make it so the parameter will allow multiple values and still search this CSV column I wish something like codeWHERE Types LIKE IN   Types  code would work, where it basically would end up as codeWHERE Types LIKE IN Type A, Type Bcode. Or is there a better way I can display the column so it appears CSV even if the SQL is not doing it I would still want it to display all the values and only see if the selected type is in the list, so if the parameter is set to codeType Bcode it should still show codeType A, Type Bcode for codeID  1code. I know CSVs are generally disliked in SQL, but it seems to be a frequent thing thats asked to make CSV columns and then allow multiselect on it.p

Negative 15080 pWere using WebSphere Portal 8.0.0.1CF12 and up until recently had been using a custom theme that I had created based on the old Portal 6.1 that we used to deploy.    I have recently created a new custom theme named FpmThemeURS8 based on the Portal 8.0 default theme and this new custom theme is packaged in a single WAR file based on this article a hrefhttpwww10.lotus.comlddportalwiki.nsfdxCreateacustomthemewithoutWebDAVwith8.0 relnofollowhttpwww10.lotus.comlddportalwiki.nsfdxCreateacustomthemewithoutWebDAVwith8.0a.   Prior to this new theme we had been using a custom theme that we had created based on Portal 6.1 and also packaged in a single WAR file.   p  pOur project relies on the Dojo framework.  We started out with Dojo 1.3, then updated to Dojo 1.6 and then to Dojo1.9.1.  We previously packaged the Dojo modulesdirectories into our Portal 6.1 based theme war file, and are at the moment having the new Portal 8.0 based theme point to that deployed Dojo location.   I know that Portal 6.1 came with an old version of Dojo, and that Portal 8.0 comes with Dojo 1.7, but our project never relied on the preinstalled Dojo that came with Portal because our project never relied on any of the supplied IBM portlets that require the builtin Dojo modules.   Wed still like to use the Dojo 1.9.1 that we were packaging with the old Portal 6.1 based theme, and replace the Dojo 1.7 that comes with the default Portal 8.0 theme.  I see that the themesPortal8.0contributions directory has the dojo17.json file in it and I also see that the profilefull.json does not have any references to the dojo modules, so I expected that by removing the dojo17.json file from the contributions directory that I could effectively remove it and allow my Dojo1.9.1 to be used in its place, but now when any page is loaded with my FpmThemeURS8 theme Im seeing an error in Firebug that reportsp  precode     TypeError dojo.back is undefined                                   racoll...nfig.js line 26, col 389628   ...terreturn this.listenerCounterdojo.back.initifdojo.hasResource[...    codepre  pAnd then when I copy that location it is a long URL ofp  precodehttpslocalhost10060wpsmycontenthandlerursutpdigestyFjCfs0Kh0BfynA2QNd1CgmashupracollectionthemeIDZJHHGGGIO0J0AE90A6N95I2D3010amplocaleenampmimetypetext2Fplainampentrymmenabler0.03Aconfigjsampentrymmbuilder0.03Aconfigjsampentrywppagebuilderbase0.03Aconfigjsampentrywppagebuilderui0.03Aconfigjsampentrymmnewpagedialog0.03Aconfigjsampentrywpportalclientrestutils0.03Aconfigjsampentrywptaggingrating0.03Aconfigjsampentrywponeui300.03Aconfigjsampentrywppagebuilderdata0.03Aconfigjsampentrywppagebuilderdnd0.03Aconfigjsampentrymmbuilderdialogs0.03Aconfigjsampentrymmpagesharingbase0.03Aconfigjsampentrymmpagesharingpermission0.03Aconfigjsampentrywpwcmmodaldialog0.03Aconfigjsampentrywpportaluiutils0.03Aconfigjsampentrywpcontentmappingpicker0.03Aconfigjsampentrywpdialogmain0.03Aconfigjsampentrywpcontextmenujs0.03Aconfigjsampentrywpliveobjectframework0.03Aconfigjsampentrywpcontextmenuliveobject0.03Aconfigjsampentrymmmovepage0.03Aconfigjsampentrywppagebuildercontrols0.03Aconfigjsampentrywpthemehighcontrast0.03Aconfigjsampentrywppagebuildershelfbase0.03Aconfigjsampentrywpanalytics0.03Aconfigjsampentrymmdeletecontrol0.03Aconfigjsampentrywpthemeedit0.03Aconfigjsampentrymmdeletepage0.03Aconfigjsampentrywpthememenus0.03Aconfigjsampentrywpthemeskinregion0.03Aconfigjsampentrywpthemewidget0.03Aconfigjsampentrywpmanagedpagessupportedit0.03Aconfigjsampentrywpprojectmenuedit0.03Aconfigjsampentrywpfederateddocumentspicker0.03Aconfigjsampentrywptemplateselectdialog0.03Aconfigjsampentrywptoolbar0.03Aconfigjsampentrywpstatusbar0.03Aconfigjsampentrywpprojectmenu0.03Aconfigjsampentrymmbuilderwiring0.03Aconfigjs codepre  pwhich appears to identify many modules, some of which I recognize from the profilefull.json file.

I have 3 device and they all act the same, so this is not a device issue.p  pIts seems that OS sees that Im trying to run an app that compiled and installed from Xcode, and trying to inform apple servers about it, fails because the device doesnt has an internet access, and force the crash.p  pAny advice will be appreciatedp  pThe application name is calc, Device Logp  precodeMay 13 101907 device9 kernel[0] ltNoticegt xpcproxy[155] Container privatevarmobileContainersDataApplicationD5768080F8C44AF0A93A0B55A318F331 sandbox May 13 101907 device9 amfid[130] ltErrorgt  SecTrustEvaluate  [leaf CriticalExtensions IssuerCommonName] May 13 101907 device9 SpringBoard[43] ltWarninggt LICreateIconForImage passed NULL CGImageRef image May 13 101907 device9 locationd[64] ltNoticegt Gesture EnabledForTopCLient 0, EnabledInDaemonSettings 0 May 13 101915 device9 amfid[130] ltErrorgt  SecTrustEvaluate  [leaf CriticalExtensions IssuerCommonName] May 13 101922 device9 amfid[130] ltErrorgt  SecTrustEvaluate  [leaf CriticalExtensions IssuerCommonName] May 13 101928 device9 SpringBoard[43] ltWarninggt Forcing crash report of ltFBApplicationProcess 0x16866020 calc pid 155gt reason 1, description nagnissoft.calc failed to launch in time May 13 101928 device9 ReportCrash[156] ltErrorgt tasksetexceptionportsB07, 400, D03, 0, 0 failed with error 4 oskern invalid argument May 13 101928 device9 kernel[0] ltNoticegt int validateCodeDirectoryHashInDaemonconst char , offt, uint8t , int  verifycodedirectory returned 0x10004005 May 13 101928 device9 SpringBoard[43] ltWarninggt Finished crash reporting.

Negative 15080 pI am attempting to subclass numpys ndarray. In my subclass, called codeMyClasscode, Ive added a field called codetimecode as a parallel array to the main data.p  pMy goal is the following suppose I make an instance of MyClass, lets call it codemccode. I slice codemccode, for instance codemc[26]code, and I want the resulting object to contain not only the properly sliced np array, but also the correspondingly sliced codetimecode array.p  pHere is my attemptp  precodeclass MyClassnp.ndarray     def newcls, data, timeNone         obj  np.asarraydata.viewcls         obj.time  time         return obj     def arrayfinalizeself, obj         setattrself, time, obj.time     def getitemself, item         print item for testing         ret  superMyClass, self.getitemitem         ret.time  self.time.getitemitem         return ret codepre  pThis does not work. After many hours of messing around, I realized it is because when I call codemc[26]code, codegetitemcode is actually called multiple times. First when it is called, the codeitemcode variable, as expected, is codeslice2,6,Nonecode. But then, the line containing codesuperMyClass, self...code calls this same function again, presumably to go retrieve the individual elements of the slice.p  pThe issue is that it supplies codegetitemcode with a strange set of parameters, always negative numbers. In the example of codemc[26]code, it calls the method 4 more times, with codeitemcode values of 4, 3, 2, and 1.p  pAs you can see, this makes it impossible for me to properly adjust the coderet.timecode variable, since it attempts to modify it multiple times, often with nonsensical indices.p  pI have tried working around this in many ways, including copying the object and editing that copy instead, taking various views of the object, and many other hacks, but none seem to overcome this issue that codegetitemcode is repeatedly called with negative indices that do not line up with the requested slice.p  pAny help or explanations as to what is going on would be greatly appreciated.p
Negative 15080 pIf Im iterating through an codeArrayModelcode using code.eachwithindexcode, is there a way to make rendering decisions based on the current codeindexcode compared with the results of a codePromisecode at the moment, this comparison returns an error about comparing a codeNumericcode with a codePromisecodep  pIn practice, I have a list that renders ten items by default, and a user can ask to render 20, 30, etc. If I have the user selection change the emqueryem, then the entire list rerenders, which is slow. If I have their selection change code if index lt selectedlimit code from false to true, then only the newlyshowing items rerender. But this only works if comparison of codeindexcode against a codePromisecode codeselectedlimitcode can be done. Is there a way to do thatp

Negative 15080 pI ran into an issue whilst attempting to create the logic to add rows to a new table I made on my MySql database. When adding a row I need to query the database 4 times to check other rows and to then add the correct value to the new row. I am using node.js and the mysql module to accomplish this. While coding I ran into a snag, the code does not wait for the 4 queries to finish before inserting the new row, this then gives the values being found a value of 0 every time. After some research I realize a callback function would be in order, looking something like thisbrp  precodevar n  0 connection.queryselect..., functionerr, rows     iferr throw err     else         ifrows.length  1 n          callback   function callback     connection.queryinsert..., functionerr          iferr throw err       codepre  pNote The select queries can only return one item so the if condition should not effect this issue.brbrp  pA callback function with only one query to wait on is clear to me, but I become a bit lost for multiple queries to wait on. The only idea that I had would be to create another variable that increments before the callback is called, and is then passed in the callback functions arguments. Then inside the callback the query could be encapsulated by an if statement with a condition of this being the variable equaling the number of queries that need to be called, 4 for my purposes here. I could see this working but wasnt sure if this sort of situation already has a built in solution or if there are other, better, solutions already developed.p

Negative 15080 pIm trying to create a XAML app for windows tablet and for some reason its not displaying some webpage correctly.

One such problem is that some images appear rotated 90 degrees to the left when it shouldnt and that tables dont appear to be separating sections of the webpage properly.p  pFrom what Ive read after hours of googling the issue, this is because the webview control utilizes an outdated version of IE, but when I checked www.whatismybrowser.com using the webview control it says that its using the most updated version so Im confused as to why this is happening.p  pAny workarounds or alternatives would be greatly appreciated. p
