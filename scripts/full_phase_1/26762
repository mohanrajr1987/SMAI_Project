Positive 26762 pI would like to deploy a codeYiicode app to codeAmazon EC2code. Ive installed codehttpdcode, codemysqlcode, codephpcode and all the necessary modules. The app was running fine on my codewampservercode localhost. Ive transferred everything DB, app folder but Im having issues with accessing the site. I see default apache site, and I see directory structure under strongvarwwwhtmlappstrong folder, and codevarwwwhtmlappwebcode gives a blank page or Internal Server Error. I have a code.htaccesscode file in codevarwwwhtmlappwebcode. I was searching a lot, and have found informations about codeallowoverridecode, virtual hosts I have only IP, what is server name then the IP, etc, and have tried a few different things, but I dont want to mess it completely up, and Im pretty sure it must be some very simple adjustments to make it work, but I dont know what maybe some settings with EC2 like elastic IP I dont yet have that one but Im not sure I need it. I dont have much experience, can you please point me to the right direction what else I have to set in order to make it work Thank you very muchp  pUPDATE I have set Elastic IP up and registered a domain.p

Positive 26762 pI have a custom form codeCreateAdminFormcode where an admin in the backend can create a new Admin user. I created my own form model so I can handle the passsword. They just fill out username, nicename, email, password, select the status active, banned, deleted, and choose a role Root, Super, Admin. They enter the password as normal, and the custom form encrypts it.  I have checks so Root can create anything, Super can only create regular Admins, and regular admins can not create any other admins at all.p  pI actually had this working on my last project, but I bypassed the codeisNewRecordcode because I created the forms in their respective view files create.php and update.php instead of them both using the same codeform.phpcode file.

Positive 26762 pI am new to Yii, actually the problem is, many times i am facing the problem like Nonobject error.p  pIt was occurred due to relations. ie for instance, we are having two table called patient and facility, to display the data in admin page we have to map these two tables and display the records there. Now when we delete the facility id for any one of the matching record for patient table nonobject error occurred.p  pI do not know, yii created based on database relations or not, but yii relation works like left join normally, even though as compared to core mysql concept left join gives results exact results like facility table values as null instead of value when they are not matching records.p  pBut in case of yii, this will not create the facility array even empty field names, that is why non object error throws, to resolve these kind of error do we have any solution on yii framework itselfp  pOtherwise i have one idea to resolve this, have to find the file which building these joins on yii and instead of empty array we can fill the table structure  ie field name as null or empty value , then the data will be displayed like empty, so that we can fix these kind of error.p  pAny one can tell me where have to find that file and where i have to touch the codep  pThanks in advancep  pExp  pstrongI need like thisstrong p  precodepatient gt          idgt1         namegtvenkat         facilityidgt 1         facilitygt array                             idgt                             facilitynamegt                          codepre  pstrongInstead ofstrong p  precodepatient gt          idgt1         namegtvenkat         facilityidgt 1         facilitygt array                           codepre

Negative 26762 pGood morning,p  pI am currently writing a python library. At the moment, modules and classes are deployed in an unorganized way, with no reasoned design. As I approach a more official release, I would like to reorganize classes and modules so that they have a better overall design. I drew a diagram of the import dependencies, and I was planning to aggregate classes by layer level. Also, I was considering some modification to the classes so to reduce these dependencies.p  pWhat is your strategy for a good overall design of a potentially complex and inthemaking python library Do you have interesting suggestions p  pThanksp  pbUpdatebp  pI was indeed looking for a rule of thumb. For example, suppose this case happens stronginitstrong.py removed for clarityp  precodefoobara.py foobarb.py foohelloc.py foohellod.py codepre  pnow, if you happen to have d.py importing bar.b and a.py importing hello.c, I would consider this a bad setting. Another case would bep  precodefoobara.py foobarbazb.py foobarbazc.py codepre  psuppose that both a.py and b.py import c. you have three solutions 1 b imports c, a import baz.c 2 you move c in foobar. a.py imports c, b.py imports .c  3 you move c somewhere else say foocpackagec.py and then both a and b import cpackage.cp  pI tend to prefer 3, but if c.py has no meaning as a standalone module, for example because you want to keep it private into the bar package, I would preferentially go for 1.p  pThere are many other similar cases. My rule of thumb is to reduce the number of dependencies and crossings at a minimum, so to prevent a highly branched, highly interweaved setup, but I could be wrong. p

Negative 26762 pWe have a central Team Foundation Server 2008 deployment where all projects get stored. Each project sets up their own build server running Team Build to do their own automated builds.p  pHeres the problem. When a connection error is detected between TFS and the Team Build server, it moves the build agents status to unreachable which means its not available for any subsequent builds. Our servers have scheduled reboot windows and when TFS cant communicate with those agents or viceversa during that window, it moves the agent to unreachable. Every morning we come in and find that we have to manually go in and reenable the agent.p  pIs it possible to have the team build agents come back online as soon theyre available again Or perhaps write a script that brings them back online automaticallyp

Negative 26762 pAn architect at my work recently read a hrefhttpdeveloper.yahoo.comperformancerules.htmlexpires relnofollowYahoos Exceptional Performance Best Practicesa guide where it says to use a farfuture Expires header for resources used by a page such as JavaScript, CSS, and images. The idea is you set a Expires header for these resources years into the future so theyre always cached by the browser, and whenever we change the file and therefore need the browser to request the resource again instead of using its cache, change the filename by adding a version number.p  pInstead of incorporating this into our build process though, he has another idea. Instead of changing file names in source and on the server disk for each build granted, that would be tedious, were going to fake it. His plan is to set farfuture expires on said resources, then implement two HttpModules. p  pOne module will intercept all the Response streams of our ASPX and HTML pages before they go out, look for resource links and tack on a version parameter that is the files last modified date. The other HttpModule will handle all requests for resources and simply ignore the version portion of the address. That way, the browser always requests a new resource file each time it has changed on disk, without ever actually having to change the name of the file on disk.p  pMake sensep  pMy concern relates to the module that rewrites the ASPXHTML page Response stream. Hes simply going to apply a bunch of Regex.Replace on src attributes of codeltscriptgtcode and codeltimggtcode tags, and href attribute of codeltlinkgtcode tags. This is going to happen for every single request on the server whose content type is texthtml. Potentially hundreds or thousands a minute.p  pI understand that HttpModules are hooked into the IIS pipeline, but this has got to add a prohibitive delay in the time it takes IIS to send out HTTP responses. No What do you thinkp

Negative 26762 pIm running an application that kicks off a Rufus Scheduler process in an initializer. The application is running with Passenger in production and Ive noticed a couple weird behaviorsp  pFirst, in order to restart the server and make sure the initializer gets run, you have to both codetouch tmprestart.txtcode and load the app in a browser. At that point, the initializer fires. The horrible thing is that if you only do the touch, the processes scheduled by Rufus get reset and arent rescheduled until you load the app in a browser. p  pThis alone I can deal with. But this leads to the second problem Ill notice that the scheduled process hasnt run, so I load a page and suddenly the log file is telling me that its running the initializers as if Id rebooted. So, at some point, Passenger is randomly rebooting as if Id touched tmprestart.txt and wiping out my scheduled processes.p  pI have an incredibly poor understanding of Passenger and Railss integration, so I dont know whether this occasional rebooting is aberrant or all part of the architecture. Can anyone offer any wisdom on this situationp

For a bit I thought I could declare Name as a String since this would just place the pointer in there and work correctly as when passing VB Strings into API calls. However, Im guessing the application terminations I got are because its a Cstyle string and not a VBstyle string, and VB looks in the memory location just before the start of the string for a length value, and gets some random garbage and blows up. Is that a reasonable guesspli lipMy call to DnsQuery works when I use am returning a DNS RR type of DNSPTRDATA or DNSADATA, but when I try DNSTXTDATA its blowing up.

This seems to indicate to me that instead of a pointer to the expected DNSTXTDATA struct, Im getting the count of strings. When I examine Other0 through Other3, they all have values which make me suspect the next four bytes are a pointer. So what gives Why is this struct just coming in inline but the others come in as pointers to the start of the structpli ol  pI appreciate any helpp

Negative 26762 pIve configure a git server. I need to use ssh because Ive defined permissions using users of my domain, using LDAP. Only users with permissions could read a project. So, the links to access my repositories are like that sshuserdomain.comhostnamevargitrepo.gitp  pWhen I clone, commit or push a project using linux git commands or using tortoisegit on windows, there is no problem, everything works as expected.p  pHowever, Ive tried to clone a project using plugins from Eclipse EGit and Netbeans NBGit, with no success.

Negative 26762 pI am using Unity3D for this question, but this is a general software engineering question.p  pEntities interactive objects in Unity3D are built with components or behaviors. By putting together behaviors together, you define the exact behavior of the object.p  pI am pondering how to have different objects react differently, when clicked, based a global state. For example, I have a tool that targets only affect circles in the scene if I select that tool, and click on an object, and if it is a circle I will change it to a square. If it is not a circle, I will just ignore it.p  pUsing the componentbased entity design, I would define a behavior called IsCircle, and when it is clicked, I will check whether what should happen to it. However, what is the best way for it to access the global state of the entire application Lets say I wish to avoid any switch, ifelse and want the solution to be decoupledp  pThe problem is that the OnMouseDown event handler does not pass in any parameters.p  pI would appreciate if the answer keeps in mind the environment I am using enforces the composite pattern.p

Negative 26762 pWhat is the best way to obtain a simple, efficient immutable queue data type in Clojurep  pIt only needs two operations, enqueue and dequeue with the usual semantics.p  pI considered lists and vectors of course, but I understand that they have comparatively poor performance  i.e. On or worse for modifications at the end and beginning respectively  so not ideal for queuesp  pIdeally Id like a proper persistent data structure with Olog n for both enqueue and dequeue operations.p

Negative 26762 pI am trying to limit the ABI of a shared library using the gccs fvisibility feature. However I am confused what is the correct way to do it. p  pMy makefile organizes the build process in two stages. At the first step all .cpp files are built to object files using some gcc options. Then all the object files are linked together using another set of gcc and ld options. From what I have read fvisibility is relevant to the second step. However this contradicts with the results I observer. If I add fvisibilityhidden to the compile time options the result is as expected, nm D reporting a much smaller set of exported symbols. On the contrary if I add it to the link time options it does not seem to affect the build.p  pWhile looking for an explanation I have compared the object files produced with and without fvisibility. The difference seems to be in the addresses of the symbols inside the object file. However I am not aware how that difference in addresses carries the message to the linker so that it is able to hide the symbols in one of the cases and expose them in the other.p  pCould anyone please explain to me that. Thank you for your time.p
Negative 26762 pWe have a web application and its front end is implemented with GWTGXT. Users can belong to various groups and these groups can then have various permissions. The permissions are quite fine grained, for example commentcreate, commentedit, commentdelete and commentread.p  pWhat would be the best way to enable and disable user interface controls based on user permissions We have an utility method that returns boolean value with given user and permission name. But at the moment each control is wrapped inside if clause and that makes the code bit messy.p

Negative 26762 p[This is my first post here but Ive browsed answers many times thanks to all for a very useful site.  If Im committing any great sins with this post, please forgive me and point me in the right direction.]p  pI am trying to debug some complicated startup code in my iPhone application I really need to draw some images to make debugging more insightful, and to radically reduce debug tedium.p  pThe state I need to draw does not really exist as a model object it is somewhat transient during initialization.  I especially want to be able to draw one bit of state at a time, rather than all of it in one big image to help me see which components are rightwrong.  In my case, there is lots of potentially overlapping stuff and a single image cannot easily, clearly display whats going on.p  pCreating a static view which draws to the screen using the normal drawing architecture might be possible, if I add a special debug mode, and additional controls to navigate  highlight  draw components, but it will require a lot of unnatural scaffolding, and is not, IMO, the right way to debug my problem.p  pSo, what I hope to do isp  ol liget or create an appropriate CGContextRefli lidraw in itli liflush it to screen immediatelyli liwait for some input from the user, that doesnt involve UIEventsli lirepeat 14 many timesli ol  pItem 4 seems to be almost impossible is there a way to get something like simple C or C console IO working in the iPhone, or the iPhone simulator, so Ive given up on it for now Ill settle for just using the Xcode debugger to stop between drawing operations.p  pBut more of interest is how to get a CGContextRef outside of a UIView draw method, in which to draw the debug output.  Caching a previously valid context, even if it were possible in my situation not possible, since Im debugging at app startup, appears not to work.  It seems as if contexts may be created anew for each drawing operation, which strikes me as incurring a lot of overhead I would have assumed a UIWindow, and maybe a UIView, saved and could provide a reference to an appropriate drawing context.  Seems I must be wrong but if not, how do I get a context from a view or window  Ive found no methods for this.p  pSo, if I must create a drawing context, how do I do it  I guess I really dont quite understand what exactly is bound together by a context to what extent does it know about, and bind to, some specific display output device  How do I control what portion of the screen a context maps to  There seem to be very few ways to create a context, and they dont seem to provide such control.  UIGraphicsBeginImageContext seems to be the only routine that might help me, and I dont see how creating and drawing into one, only to produce a CGImage as a result will be useful how would I get the resulting image onto the screenp  pI wont be surprised to find Im confused about some basic stuff related to CG contexts.  Hopefully, this question isnt so basic and obvious that Ill be annoying everyone who reads it, but if Ive completely missed the right documentation, Id be very appreciative of a few pointers.p  pThanks for your mental bandwidth, and any help.  jarp

Negative 26762 pI am curious as to how caching works in Google App Engine or any cloud based application.

Negative 26762 pHey, I have an iphone program that has a parser that parses some XML from a website and produces results.p  pIts not clear for me how to use the array of objects I create. I believe that the array is created correctly, but I dont know how to tell the mainview that the xml finished parsing and its time to get the result array and fill the view.p  pI did some test and i noticed that of course calling the parser and then getting the array results in having the array empty because the elements need still to be created.p  pAny suggestionsp

Negative 26762 pThis will be confusing for me to explain so please bear with me.p  pIve already implemented most type of movements and rotations in my camera class, everything is working with the keyboard, now I want to implement the mouse. I capture the mouse movement like thisp  precodedefine SENSITIVITY 25.0f  void mainvoid      ...     glutPassiveMotionFuncprocessPassiveMotion         glutWarpPointerWINDOWWIDTH  2, WINDOWHEIGHT  2     glutSetCursorGLUTCURSORNONE     ...   void processPassiveMotionint x, int y      int centerX  WINDOWWIDTH  2     int centerY  WINDOWHEIGHT  2      int deltaX  1  x  centerX     int deltaY  1  y  centerY      ifdeltaX  0  deltaY  0          mainCamera.RotatedeltaX  SENSITIVITY, deltaY  SENSITIVITY          glutWarpPointercenterX, centerY       codepre  pAfter everything Ive read, I believe this is enough in my situation. However I must state that first I tried to call the codePitchcode and codeYawcode camera functions but it was a no go, I had to create an extra function to rotate both axis at the same time.p  pThat rotate function goes something like thisp  precodedefine DEG2RADa a  MPI  180.0f define SINDEGa  sinDEG2RADa define COSDEGa  cosDEG2RADa  void CameraRotateGLfloat angleX, GLfloat angleY      Reference  NormalizeVector         Reference  COSDEGangleY  UpVector  SINDEGangleY           Reference  NormalizeVector         Reference  COSDEGangleX  RightVector  SINDEGangleX           UpVector  CrossProductampReference, ampRightVector  1     RightVector  CrossProductampReference, ampUpVector  codepre  pThe codeReferencecode is the viewing direction, the point the camera is looking at. And since its a normalized vector, it goes from 1.0 to 1.0. This vector, or point, is later used together with another vector codePositioncode, which is the camera location to calculate the real look at point to use in codegluLookAtcode, like thisp  precodevoid CameraLookAtvoid      Vector3D viewPoint  Position  Reference      gluLookAt         Position.x, Position.y, Position.z,         viewPoint.x, viewPoint.y, viewPoint.z,         UpVector.x, UpVector.y, UpVector.z       codepre  pAll vector operations above like codecode, codecode and codecode are overloaded of course.p  pNow Im going to try to describe my problem...p  pThe rotate function above works just fine in the sense that it correctly performs a pitch and yaw by using the mouse. However, those rotations dont look like the ones in First Person Shooter games. In those games, when one looks at sky and then looks leftright, one expects to keep looking at the sky. Imagining we are inside a sphere, a movement like that should draw a circle in the top part of the sphere.p  pBut thats not what happens because thats not what a yaw does. A yaw movement will rotate around an arbitrary axis, which I think is the up vector in this situation. So, the  problem is in the yaw movement because the pitch seems to work fine.p  pIn other words, my code above cant keep the horizon leveled and thats what must happen cause thats happens in games when one looks at the sky and then look leftright, the horizon is always leveled. The same will not happen with my code, I look up and then leftright, and the horizon will be all twisted.p  pDid I make myself clear enough Im not sure how can I explain this any better.  Hopefully its enough for anyone to understand.p  pIm not sure how can I fix this problem... How can I look leftright correctly after looking updown, keeping the horizon leveledp  pstrongEDITstrongp  pMy rotate function code is taken from both the Yaw and Pitch functions which also exist so I can call those rotations independently. For reference purposes Ill add them below along with the Roll function too which Ill probably never use, but in case I need it, its therep  precodevoid CameraPitchGLfloat angle      Reference  NormalizeVector         Reference  COSDEGangle  UpVector  SINDEGangle           UpVector  CrossProductampReference, ampRightVector  1   void CameraYawGLfloat angle      Reference  NormalizeVector         Reference  COSDEGangle  RightVector  SINDEGangle           RightVector  CrossProductampReference, ampUpVector   void CameraRollGLfloat angle      RightVector  NormalizeVector         RightVector  COSDEGangle  UpVector  SINDEGangle           UpVector  CrossProductampReference, ampRightVector  1  codepre

I think it has to do with one of the limits with SendKeys that you cant SendKeys to a lock computer.p  pAnyone got an idea beside saying SendKeys are bad, dont use itp  pThanksp
Negative 26762 pI have a Linq query that returns an anonymous type, which I then use as the data source for a GridView. Only 1 of those columns need to be editable. I just want to be able to click on an edit button and have ALL the rows of that 1 column become textboxes ideally. I will settle for having a CommandField for each row. The problem is, I dont know how to do that without creating a custom class or manually dealing with all the fields. This column must also update a value in the database in a specific way so I need to write custom code for that query.p  pAt the moment, Im easily able to make the whole thing display in the Grid View. I even created a custom DataTable to use as the Data Source and that works okay. But Im still at a loss as to how to add the strongediting capabilitiesstrong. The tutorials I have found are either for a DataSource control or involve making custom classes that extend GridView and what not. Ive added a CommandField in the aspx page, which works okay but the ReadOnly columns in the DataTable are still editable.p  pstrongId rather have a simple solution...for example, making a TemplateField in the .aspx page that I can give an Item and EditItem Template and somehow bind to the fields returned by my Linq query.strongp  pIve included some pseudocode below which creates 2 GridViews.

Negative 26762 pIm trying to get to grips with different patterns MVP, MVVM etc and find one that suits my needs. After all my reading Im still not sure. Hopefully someone can shed some light on this for me.p  pAt the moment I have a WPF View which implements an interface ICustomView. This interface is injected into my Presenter. The presenter then is responsible for subscribing to data, managing subscriptions etc. When the data is returned to the Presenter it calls various methods against the Model an IObservable collection of CustomBusinessObjects. It does this using the interface ICustomView since the IObservable is a property of the Model.p  pThe problem I see with this is the Model is too coupled with the View. Also the Presenter is deciding which methods to call against the Model. At the moment the View consists of a WinForms grid and this is exposed by the ICustomView allowing the Presenter to call methods against the View. However it adds to the coupling of Presenter and View which makes it difficult to swap out this WinForms grid for a WPF grid or chart etcp  pI am considering making the Model an entirely seperate entity lets say IModel with a single method ProcessUpdatestring topic, IMessage payload. This would move logic away from the presenter into the Model. It would also mean more than one view could share the same model. The custom model could have additional interfaces for specific customisations but the Presenter would only need to know about IModel. p  pDoes this sound like a reasonable idea Am I missing something herep  pAny advice appreciated.p  pThanks p

Or again should this be in the controllerp  pI am interested in the best practices when developing large rails applications.p
Negative 26762 pI would like to use OpenOffice correction feature programmatically in PHP that is be able to correct a word if misspelled. I found a hrefhttppuno.sourceforge.netinstall.html relnofollowPUNOa which I believe will help me use the OpenOffice API. However from there I have simply no idea where to go. If someone could give me directions that would be great. Using OpenOffice correction feature isnt a requirement at all. If someone knows about a PHP class that can do some spelling check I would also be interested, however Im guessing that quality wise, it wont get anywhere close to the OpenOffice correction feature hence my initial request.p  pstrongupdatedstrong my aim is to perform American to British English translation so the correction feature must be able to work with American and British English dictionaries.p  pThanks.p

Negative 26762 pstrongI have a question for anyone with experience in dealing with complex coding in PHP, Jquery and SQL. I realize I wrote a lot but I wanted to be detailed.strong I have an issue with strong1strong solution that I can think of but it doesnt seem very efficient, especially with large amounts of traffic. I have a table that stores messages from users. I am designing a chat platform where users can open a chatbox and send instant messages to other users who are their friends.p  pI need the ability to have it so when a user opens a box from his online friends and sends a message, that friend will have a chatbox pop up with the message or messages and the box will update from there. I would like that box to also maintain the previously sent messages in it from page to page when the user is navigating the site until he closes the box. When this happens, I created a viewed column which I can mark as 1 for all the messages that were in that box at the time. From then on those messages will not pop up. Only new ones will. So closing the box essentially resets it.p  pI have a simple JSON function where information is sent and a php handler runs a query and returns all the messages. They are then sorted into their boxes.p  pstrongWhat I think is one solutionstrong is to put a refresh time interval on the json code and check for messages constantly where viewed0. If there are and the box has not yet popped up, it will and have the messages htmld into the boxes. The problem with this is that the query will be selecting all the messages that the user has received and they will be constantly overwriting the boxes which wont show visually but seems taxing on the system. I was trying to think of a way that involves a query that checks for timestamps that are greater then a timestamp sent in the jquery function. strongIF anyone has any recommendations or useful articles or information, I would greatly appreciate it.strongp  precode.getJSON..collabrrchatbox.phpactionviewamploadinitialampreceiverusername amptoken token, functionjson      fori0 i lt json.length i      openchat data   user  json[i].user  makes chatbox open up with name of sender      chatbox[datanamejson[i].user]gtmessagebox.prependltdiv idchatboxresponsegtjson[i].userjson[i].messageltdivgt.findli.fadeIn1500       sql  SELECT timestamp, user, message, receiver   FROM chatbox WHERE receiver AND viewed ORDER BY timestamp DESC stmt  conngtpreparesql resultstmtgtexecutearrayGET[receiver],0           Field     Type          Null      Key   Default     Extra id            int6    NO    PRI   NULL            autoincrement convoid  varchar35   NO      NULL      timestamp int11   NO      NULL      user      varchar25   NO      NULL      receiver  varchar25   NO      NULL      message   varchar150  NO      NULL      viewed    int1    NO      NULL     codepre

Negative 26762 pFor anyone who is struggling with how to get ie9 to read an xml file from the server, and not from cache, heres a simple solution.  If you are able to modify the html page which is loading the xml using javascript and XmlHttpRequest, you can use a hidden iframe to force the xml to load when the page is refreshed.  For example, somewhere in the html page, add the followingp  precode    ltiframe srcmyfile.xml width0 height0 styledisplaynonegtltiframegt ltresolves xml caching issuesgt codepre  pHope this helps.  It may not be the best solution since it causes another get from the server, but I searched and searched and tried various header setting combinations such as xmlhttp.setRequestHeaderCacheControl, nocache and nothing worked in ie9  ie8 would read the xml from the server if you closed the browser and reopened it.  But ie9 simply will not at least not from my godaddy server.  So with this method, you can simply refresh the page, and the xml will be read from the server every time.  ie9 seems to have really applied caching to the extreme to where its making it difficult to get fresh data.  I use godaddy hosting, Im not sure if that adds further issues  maybe due to proxy servers.p  pHope this helps. Markp

Negative 26762 pI have a proprietary application which uses an xml config. Currently I use boostpropertytree to read the xml file.p  pI would like to deploy both executable and xml file on a more public system and want to avoid anyone, including that systems administrator, from reading the xml.p  pIdeally, I would like to maintain the clear text xml on my system so I can easily manually modify it. Then I would call some encrypt command on the file, deploy it on the more public machine and have the executable decrypt it on the fly. Id use the same key and just hardcode it into the source of the executable.p  pIs this a reasonable approach What is the easiest way to implement this Is there a better wayp

Negative 26762 pI have a series of methods being called for my networking code. An event gets fired from the networking thread. Inside this event, which Ive hooked into from a singleton class, I route messages to form level methods which they register on form load to handle certain messages they care about. Inside of these form message hooks I need to close the current form which I was able to do but also show a different one which is giving me the trouble.p  pThe new form sort of shows but its hangingnot updating. Im sure this has something to do with that form because its .Show was basically called from another thread sort of doesnt have a message loop, but Im not sure how else to solve this. The network message that gets received indicates on the client machine what forms to close and show.p  pThe flow might be confusing so Ill try better to explain.p  pLogin form attaches user defined functions inside that form to a singleton class list of messages. For example when a message called LOGINSTATUS is fired I assign a function from the Login form to a list defined in this singleton class.p  pThe singleton class has the network class defined in it which actually runs on another thread, but this is all handled inside the class. In the private ctor I subscribe to the OnData event of this network class.p  pWhen OnData gets fired from the network class to the singleton class it passes to it the type of data. I loop through the list of function pointers to see if any of them are linked to LOGINSTATUS and if so call them. This will call the Login forms function. Inside that function I need to close the Login form and open the Lobby form. Thats when the Lobby form shows, but is hung up and not updating.p  pHope that makes sense.p  pThis is all being done in VB.NET where I have the close when last form closed setting on which is what I want. VB.NET also makes it easier to manage forms since I can just for formname.Show instead of having to keep a list of the forms and manage them myself like in C so if thats still possible with the solution that would be ideal.p

Negative 26762 pIm working on some implementation of a hrefhttpactivitystrea.ms relnofollowhttpactivitystrea.msa using Rails  which has nothing to do with the current question. Im curious about how should the Share verb be implemented. I mean, its easy. You add an activity which refers to the one you share and put the share verb in it. Bamp  pBut, in Google and Facebook, you can add a comment to the thing you are sharing. Where should this comment be stored I first thought about creating a Share object which holds the reference to the original activity you are sharing plus the comment, but the defeat the specification at activitystrea.ms ... So according to the specification, they are storing that comment directly into the activity, probably using the content field Does that seems to be the way to do it. Any ideap  pThanksp

Negative 26762 pIm new to Android development and am confused about how to accomplish what Im trying to do. Ive done some reading and learning about fragments so I can share layout and code between various screen size designs. Ive got a couple of fragments created and have used them successfully. But Ive got a situation where I want to show a fragment in a normal activity on the phone, but want to show the fragment in a PopupWindow or something similar if theres a better choice on a tablet. p  pIve managed to figure out how to inflate the fragment and display it in a PopupWindow when a button is clicked. My code looks like thisp  precodepublic void onClickView v      LayoutInflater inflater  LayoutInflater BrowsingActivity.this.getSystemServiceContext.LAYOUTINFLATERSERVICE     View popupLayout  inflater.inflateR.layout.serverconnectionfragment, null, false     connectionListPopup  new PopupWindowpopupLayout, 300, 470, true     connectionListPopup.showAtLocationBrowsingActivity.this.findViewByIdR.id.connectionListImage, Gravity.CENTER, 0, 0  codepre  pThe popup appears and contains the UI described in serverconnectionfragment.xml. The problem is that by creating it this way, the Fragment class ServerConnectionFragment.java is never instantiated so there are no items in the list in my UI, no listeners on buttons, and so on. It seems like there should be a way for me to instantiate the java class, have it inflate the fragment normally and attach event listeners, then pass the view created there into the PopupWindow constructor, but I cant figure out how. Can anyone help me outp  pFYI, Im building this for Android 2.1 using the Androidsupportv4.jar file for the Fragment classes.p  pThanksp

Negative 26762 pId like to simplify the workflow so that rather than issuing these commandsp  precode make programunittest   ... output of MAKE ...  .programunittest args codepre  pI could have my program automatically attempt to compile itself if the source has been updated when it is run, so that I do not have to go back and run make myself. p  pHeres what Im thinking My unit test build should first check if there is a makefile in the directory its in, and if so, fork and exec codemakecode with the target corresponding to itself. If codemakecode determines nothing to be done, it will continue on its way running the unittests. However, if codemakecode actually performs a compilation, one of two things may happen. codegcccode invoked by codemakecode might be able to overwrite the build an older version of which is already running during compilation, in which case I can then perhaps exec it. If my system does not permit codegcccode to overwrite the program which is in use, then I have to quit the program before running codemakecode. p  pSo this has become quite involved already. Are there perhaps more elegant solutions Maybe I could use a bash script How do I ascertain if codemakecode issued compilation commands or notp

Negative 26762 pIn my iPhone app I have implemented a custom tab bar which functions perfectly, no problems there. However, there is one problem that Im encountering Basically my custom tab bar doesnt actually control the tab bar views, it just signals the underlying standard codeUITabBarControllercode that it should codesetSelectedIndex1code, etc. Its basically only a visual custom tab bar without any logic behind it. Therefore, I need to hide the underlying standard codeUITabBarcode that does all of the dirty work behind the scenes.p  pThe most common thing Ive come across with my friend Google is that people have used this code to hide the tab barp  precodeforUIView view in tabbarcontroller.view.subviews      if[view isKindOfClass[AppTabBarControlleriPhone class]]              [view setFrameCGRectMakeview.frame.origin.x, 480, view.frame.size.width, view.frame.size.height]           else               [view setFrameCGRectMakeview.frame.origin.x, view.frame.origin.y, view.frame.size.width, 480]       codepre  pIndeed, this does push the tab bar just out of sight, but it brings along another problem in any scroll views The background image of every scrollview is getting repeated for 44 pixels i.e. the height of the tab bar that has been shifted down and so that makes for a truly ugly experience.p  pIs there some sort of codesetFramecode hack I can do to make this work out, or do you have a completely better way of hiding the tab bar that would eradicate this problemp

Negative 26762 h2PART 01 INTROh2  pHey Stackoverflow Greetings from the Snowy alps of Norwayp  pI have now tried for two full consecutive days to reverse engineer Magic Fields. Why Because I am a simple man, and want to import data to my wordpress from an exotic database using CSV and not programming a php routine, which I dont know nor understand.p  pThis has worked for all vanilla Wordpress fields, i.e. postdata, categories and so on. I used LibreOffice Calc to finetune the CSV data, Quest Toad for MySQL import and to create MySQL queries.p  pMy designer has designed this entire thing extensively using the Magic Fields plugin. Therefore I have to deal with Magic Fields for the rest of the data that I need to have imported. Its a movie database, so its the typical metadata for movies like codeproductionyearcode codeproducercode codeimdblinkcode codeyoutubetrailerlinkcode and so on.p  pMy question is that I am hoping to get some insightsideassupport on how to import these data into the magic fields. I have tried and given up the magic fields importer, it is not documented and does not give any error messages when I try to import various csv formats.p  h2PART 02 Understanding Magic Fieldsh2  pMy question is how can I populateinsert a magic field with data using a mysql query I have tried to understand what it is Magic Fields is doing when I put some data into a magic field and press save, in the admineditpostfrontend. It does a lot of things that I cant seem to recreate. For one it is not enough to insert data into the two places where the data is referenced. codewppostmetacode and codewpmfpostmetacode.p  pThis example post is not sufficient to get the data to work i.e. display themselves in wordpress neither in the adminposteditor nor the frontend for the userp  precodeINSERT INTO wppostmeta postid,metakey,metavalue VALUES 474,originaltitle,Die Hard 3  INSERT INTO wpmfpostmeta  metaid, fieldname, fieldcount, groupcount, postid   VALUES  1100083, originaltitle , 1,1 ,474  codepre  pAlso with that metaid number, Magic Fields creates a number series of 10 for each post, like 70007010 and then 80008010. I dont understand where it takes those numbers from, and whether they have to be sequentialconsecutive. I have found that once entered by the adminposteditor frontend, I can change the codemetaidscode in codewppostmetacode and codewpmfpostmetacode and it still works. But again when I try to create them myself with a SQL query, it just doesnt work TM.p  pAfter enabling MySQL querylogging and examining the logfile from the MySQL db engine gives and then trying to insert the queries manually that I can make out from the logs, I still cant make Wordpress find the data and display them properly on the page.p  pI can modify the data with mysql queries after I have populated them using the frontend with no problems.p  pAlso using the query logs, I found that after I push SAVE in the Wordpress frontendposteditor it does no less than 780 mysql query lines regardless if I populate 1 or 10 of my magic fieldsp  pThe other thing I have tried is to take a snapshot of the database before and after I have done the post of the magic fields, and then used a difftool various, WinMerge and Notepad mainly. I cant understand what its doing but I THINK it is doing some hidden trickery in wptermtaxonomy. This is just speculation.p  pPart 03 Conclusion I dont know programming so any practical solution, would be deeply apprechiated.p  pthe full query I want to do per post I have about 800 of these is here httppastebin.com5cZT3AjAp  pThe FULL list of queries that Magic Fields is doing after I push save in the adminfrontend is listed here which I call the robotatwork. a hrefhttppastebin.comc2c6qUQt relnofollowhttppastebin.comc2c6qUQta To be sure I have checked three times that it wasnt something extraordinary that it is doing 780 lines after I push save.p  pI guess if I could find a way to bulkedit all of my posts, and then have the robot i.e. adminpostedit frontend do the work to create all these lines in the database. I could then change the fields afterwards... But the bulkeditor doesnt show the magicfield editor either.p  pI have twisted my head around this problem 10 times now, and cant twist anymorep

Negative 26762 pIs there any way to programatically create client or server side PHP a image from a specific DIV or a complete web page Im currently creating a website for free coupons and the idea is when the enduser clicks on the Print button, the app opens a new tabwindow with all the selected coupons as a single image JPG, PNG or etc.. in A4 format ready for printing.

If not already exist, I will uploadpublish it for free  p  pUpdate I did it with the PHP GD library  Still not satisfied with the idea to use Images instead of PDF, because each printing results with different Coupon sizes images on different PCs.

Negative 26762 pWe are going to build a web service from metadata read at runtime.  I mean the entire web service  the signatures, contracts and implementation.p  pThere are two main paths I see from here.p  pThe first path is that you generate code.  Either you generate C code in strings and compile it on the fly or more elegantly and complicatedly, you emit MSIL code.  This way you have WCF code and WCF will take care of generating the WSDL from it.p  pThe second path is to use a generic service.  A service with an operation Message ProcessMessage accepting everything.  We still want to expose the service as a normal service, so I would need a WSDL somewhere.  How can I create a WSDL  I thought about using System.ServiceModel.Description until I realised that deep inside, this API depends on concrete types.  With this approach we wouldnt have any data contract type and would process XML on the fly, using metadata to interpret it.  So we need somehow to generate the WSDL.  Is that a crazy idea  WSDL has quite a complicated spec...p  pA third option would be to use an hybrid approach, emitting types just to create signatures but implementing the service using nonemitted code reflecting on emitted types.  Weird, but might be simpler than hand crafting WSDL by hand...p  pSuggestionsp

Negative 26762 pIve tried many different ways to phrase this question to google et al with no luck. Not even sure the title of this question captures the nuance of the issue. Ill try to explain then show the experiment. I hope someones will be able to point to some explanation of whats going on.p  pstrongGivenstrongp  ul libefore the end of BODY, you have a script A that programmatically inserts a script element using my preferred technique, document.createElement into the document which references a remotescript Bli liremotescript B performs a document.write of any content e.g. hello, worldli libefore the end of BODY and just after script A you have a script C that references a remotescript which takes a while to load e.g. 1sli ul  pWhat will happen is that A executes, inserts B into the document and starts to download the resource. While B is downloading, C will execute and wait, because of the delay. While C is waiting, B is downloaded and executes we have not yet hit DOMContentLoaded document.readyState is still loading. The document.write from B is ignored gobbled up, as if we are postDOMContentLoaded. C then finishes downloading and executes. p  pstrongExperimentstrongp  ul liSource a hrefhttpjsfiddle.netjaknowldenpwHG8 relnofollowhttpjsfiddle.netjaknowldenpwHG8ali liTry it out directly a hrefhttpjsfiddle.netjaknowldenpwHG8show relnofollowhttpjsfiddle.netjaknowldenpwHG8showali liWaterfall MANUAL LINK[cl.ly423P2M1d0r0e0k3h370g]li liRemote script MANUAL LINK[thumblemonks.comjsstackoverflowscriptb.js]li ul  pI am using Cuzillion to create the delay.

Call this A I suppose it shows that if you dynamically add a script that has text i.e. not a remote script which contains a document.write, the doc.write in A WILL work.p  pAlso, dummy.js and the CSS files come from JSFiddle. They are not the culprits I can recreate this issue anywhere.p  pThings I knowp  ul liif you replace C with an IMG, there is no issueli liif you replace C with an IFRAME, there is no issueli liif you move A after C, there is no issueli ul  pstrongNowstrongp  pPerhaps there is a perfectly valid reason for this. There must be since all of the browsers Ive tested in seem to behave in roughly the same way. What Id like to know is why Any explanations, hints, andor pointers are welcome. Even hints like Its in the spec, dumby  Ive got thick skin I can handle it.p  pDISCLAIMER I abhor document.write. My intention is not to support or bolster its use in any way. However, given the nature of my work, I have to work around it for now and this oddity sprung itself on me. Thus, Id like to avoid comments along the line of you shouldnt use document.write because this, I already believe in p

Negative 26762 pI have a simple metro app contains a button, a label and a drop down list. The drop down list contains a list of files that I can read from. When I click on the button, the selected files content gets read into the label. Files are in the Documents folder i.e WinRTs  KnownFolders.DocumentsLibrary. Each file represents a StorageFile in WinRT API.p  pFile reading method is an asynchronous method uses asyncawait. In order to prove the asynchronous behaviour, I made the file reading method as a long running process. Therefore, while executing this long running method, I should be able to freely click on the drop down list and select a different file. This is because the UI thread should not get blocked while reading the file. However this is not currently happening. It still seems to be blocking UI thread, and drop down list get frozen while the long running method occurs. I must be doing something odd here.

Negative 26762 pWe are talking about using the Adapter Pattern for logging. Im not sure that this is a good idea since we will probably never change our logging implementation, but a question arose while we spoke about this  Does the abstract logging module should hide the configuration details of the various logging implementations  p  pI have seen two projects using an Adapter Pattern to abstract logging one of them is the a hrefhttpnetcommon.sourceforge.netdocs2.0.0referencehtmlch01.htmlloggingabstract relnofollowCommon Infrastructure Library for .NETa.p  pIn both projects, the configuration the client must provid depends on logging implementations. For example, the client must provide a Log4Net config file if log4net is used.p  pAm I wrong when I think that this is an incomplete implementation of the Adapter Pattern  To me, if the client must have some knowledge about the adaptee, it will not be possible to swap the implementation without breaking the client...p  pBut Im not sure.p  pThank you for your advice.p

Its possible to mock classes but youre only going to be able to have control over the virtual thus mockable methods.p  pIn Java, as methods are virtual by default then I imagine that mocking a class is going to be just the same as mocking an interface because everything is going to be overridden with mocking behaviour.p  pSo, is it still best practice to have dependencies on interfaces and consequently mock interfaces in unit tests in Java, or do most Java developers use classes to reduce the number of types no need for an interfacep

Negative 26762 pIm writing a script to insert rows into a SQL Server 2008 database datatable which contains an XML column.

I have a page that reads from an XML file and then uses the returned data to inject images and information of available products. When the user clicks on one of these images I wish to display a dialog... this is easy I just use the following the dialog is a div within my page not a separate filep  precodeentrylevelphones img.liveclick, function     .mobile.changePagepopupEntry,  role dialog      codepre  pOkay, I now wish to extend this so when a specific image is clicked I read the same XML file and retrieve more information on the chosen product. This information is formatted, injected as innerHTML into the dialog div and displayed... something like so...p  precodeentrylevelphones img.liveclick, function      I know the ID of what was clicked using this.id     .ajax         type  GET,         url  hardware.xml,         dataType  xml,         success  getProductthis.id        function getProductproductID      productContent        code to parse through XML and format using the passed productID to locate the relevent info      productContent  outFromParsingData     popupEntry.htmlproductContent      .mobile.changePagepopupEntry,  role dialog, testtest       codepre  pnow the problem is I need to pass the relevant id this.id to the success callback. Normally you would just state the function name and the returned xml from the ajax call is passed through I still dont understand how and why.p  precodesuccess  getProduct  this is ajax call  getProductxml  heres the returned xml passed as an argument  codepre  pwith the amends above I can read the returned XML but I dont have my chosen ID... so finally my question... how do I pass the id and xml to my getProduct function Many thanks.p

Negative 26762 pstrongHas anyone ever encountered a problem where a SQL query from a classic ASP page returns empartialem results, but no errorsstrong p  pI have a situation where a particular query on a page one of many throughout the system is returning a strongdifferentstrong number of rows each time it is run, and always stronglessstrong than the correct number, as determined by running the SQL against the server directly.p  pI think this may be related to the connection timeout since this occurs with a longrunning query and my timing shows that it is returning very close to the timeout, but I am receiving no timeout errors.

Negative 26762 pIm building a web based ASP .NET application to display Crystal Reports. The reports itself have been build in Crystal Reports XI and Im working in Visual Studio 2010. Its working but the Parameter Panel visible on the left of the report is blank, eg. it does not display any parameters even though the report has a few of them and the user is prompted to enter their values before the report is generated. Ive found some information that this might be caused by an old version of Crystal Reports XI used to produce those reports and, indeed, a test report written in Visual Studio 2010 has its parameters shown correctly. p  pMy question is How can I make this to work without rewriting the reports once again I tried to open up an existing report in Visual Studio and saving it, it gave me a warning that this the current version of the report is newer than the previous one, however it didnt solve the issue.

I am not sure what advantages each solution has.p  pI also know that dynamoDB runs on SSDs and mongoDB is inmemory.p  pAn advantage of mongoDB would be that Java Play already supports mongodb.p  pNow we dont expect too much database usage, but we would need to scale pretty fast if our app grows.p  pWhat alternatives do I have What proscons do they have Consideringp  ul liPricingli liScalingli liEase of useli liPlay supportli ul

Negative 26762 pI have searched around but have yet to find a satisfying answer for my issuep  pOverview I am working on a small app that uses several DateTime fields into a single table using WCF.  We are trying to eliminate null fields in all of our tables.  Up until now, whenever we are converting a datetime field selected from a table we first verify that it is null before we display or otherwise use it.  If the value is NULL, we substitute codeDateTime.MinValuecode for the value.  Since we are now removing the nullable aspect of all fields, we need to insert a common value representing null since codeDateTime.MinValuecode is substituted everywhere in the code, it seems like a viable value to put into the field as a null substitute.p  pThe problem Inserting a codeDateTime.MinValuecode causes the generic problem executing this request error.  p  pSolution  As has been documented elsewhere, the codeDateTime.MinValuecode has an unspecified DateTimeKind so... we add the ToUniversalTime call, as in p  precodeDateTime nullDate  DateTime.MinValue.ToUniversalTime  110001 60000 AM codepre  pThis doesnt work, perhaps because of some acceptable range setting within Date conversions on WCFp  pNoted in the comment is the resulting value of 110001 600 am.  The odd 600am or the year 1 aside, that seems fine. Considering the past of default years like 1200 AM 1970 are still fairly standard, but I digress...p  pYes, I know that DateTime is not C, its .NET.   Im also aware that WCF has some form of min and max times allowed within its conversion constraints.  I dont know how to set those nor do I know how to set the VerboseMessages bit Im fairly new to WCF.p  pThe suggestion to manually create a new field value that converts nicely into the table is viable, and it worksp  precodeDateTime nullDate  new DateTime1970, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, DateTimeKind.Utc codepre  pBTW, If we use the year 1 instead of 1970 for example the insert will also fail.p  pEven if we were to use the above nullDate as a workable substitute... the problem is that everywhere in the code we are still evaluating against codeDateTime.MinValuecode representing a null date, and those two dates arent quite the same.p  pThe only viable solution that I can think of is to override or otherwise create an extended class from DateTime to create a common NullDate and modify all the code accordingly.p  pDoes anyone see a good alternative  Does anyone know a solution to inserting the codeSystem.DateTime.MinValuecode into a WCF table such as altering the acceptable boundries of a goodbad datep  pI feel like Im going to have to bite the bullet and change all references to MinValue... Im trying to avoid that because it doesnt follow any sort of standard logical thought in evaluating default values.p  pSuggestions anyonep

Negative 26762 pI have an app that consists of a local server and a GUI client. The server is written in Python, while the GUI is meant to be changable, and is written in Flex 4. The client queries the local server for information and displays it accordingly. Both applications are meant to be run on the same computer, and will only communicate locally. At the moment, the client and the Python server communicates via a basic socket, the client writes a request to the socket, and the socket returns some data.p  pHowever, since Im writing a desktop app, I thought it might be easier to maintain and to polish a system that uses standard streams instead of a socket. The server would listen for coderawinputcode continuously, and output according to anything written to stdin, and the client, in this case, would use AIRs codeNativeProcesscode class to read and write to stdout and stdin, rather than using sockets. p  pThe client and server are separate processes, but are meant to be started at more or less the same time. I dont really have need for complex networking, just local crosslanguage communication. p  pWhat are the pros and cons of each approach What would I gain or lose from using sockets, vs what I would gain or lose from using standard streams to communicate Which one is more efficient Which one is easier to maintainp

Negative 26762 pIm making a Rails app that uses Mongoid and devise. Currently, the functionalitys pretty basic, but its not working like I expect it to. In particular, update isnt working at all.p  pI can create a user, but when I go back to update it, it doesnt raise any errors, but also doesnt save. This may be clearer with some code. Ive got this in routesp  precodedevisefor users resources users codepre  pAnd this in the controllerp  precode WORKS PERFECTLY FOR SIGNING USERS UP, AND FLASHES CORRECTLY   def new     user  User.new   end    def create     user  User.newparams[user]     if user.save       flash[success]  Welcome       signin user       redirectto user     else       render new     end   end   DOES NOT UPDATE THE USER RECORD, AND DOES NOT FLASH SUCCESS  IT DOES, HOWEVER, REDIRECT TO SHOW, INSTEAD OF RENDERING EDIT   def edit     user  User.findparams[id]   end    def update     user  User.findparams[id]     if user.save       flash[success]  Profile edited successfully       redirectto user     else       render edit     end    end codepre  pSo yeah. As the code suggests, going through my views to edit an existing user does NOT edit that user, nor does it give the flash saying the users was edited, but it DOES redirect correctly. I currently have NO user validations though devise might have some  but changing all deviserelevant fields doesnt get around the issue, so I dont think its a silent validation fail. p  pThe form is of the basic p  precodelt formfor user do f gt   lt f.label name gt   lt f.textfield name gt   ...   lt f.submit gt lt end gt codepre  psort.p  pNot sure what other code could be helpful here.

Negative 26762 pI use OpenERP with Jasper Report module. The problem is to get amount of generated pages in words. So I found the solution import in iReport my own library in .jar file and use some methods from it. But I get some problems. pparently, iReports classpath to libraries didnt used in Jasper Reports in OpenERP and I always get Unable to resolve class exception. I tryed to copy .jar in jasperreportsjavalib folder, but it ineffectually. Maybe someone faced to this problem And the question is How to import my own java libraries in japserreports Or, ideally, get another way to print amount of pages in words.p

Negative 26762 pI have a little website which contains a div positioned at the bottom of the page, when clicked this div slides up into view. This div contains three tabs which are again hidden divs, with only div1 on view showing tab1, clicking the link to div2 opens tab2, and the same for div3. p  pThis all works fine... however each tab contains dynamic data from a database, with recordset paging links to the next set of data for that tab ie each tab only contains 6 items from the database, the forward and back arrows on the page take you to the nextprevious set of six items for that tab. My problem is that by clicking these links, the main div slides back down, AND the tabs go back to the default tab1. I need the main div to stay shown, AND the relevant tab to stay shown.

Negative 26762 pI have a strange issue with one of my iPad apps.p  pWhen the app starts up, I can tap a bar button item to display a UIActionSheet, and the action sheet displays normally from the bar button item with all the button options and title. However, if I select an action from this sheet, it uses presentViewController to show another very simple view controller, and when that view controller dismisses itself, if I tap on the same bar button item as before I get an action sheet that is not correct. Here is what the action sheet popover looks likep  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comJwFsU.png altenter image description herep  pThe height of the action sheet is correct for the number of options that the action sheet is supposed to have, but it is like the title and all the button text are empty or nil. However, after I create the action sheet, I log the number of buttons and button text for each, and everything looks the same from the first time to the second time.p  pI am on the latest Xcode and SDK, and the app is targeting iOS 5.0 or newer. Any ideas as to what is going onp  pEDIT Here is some code.

What I would like to accomplish is determine where the call came from TabA or TabB and only update the textfield associated with that tab.p  pHope this makes some sensep  precodepublic class Main extends JFrame       private static final long serialVersionUID  1L     private JPanel contentPane     public JTextField tfPanelA     public JTextField tfPanelB             Launch the application.           public static void mainString[] args          EventQueue.invokeLaternew Runnable              public void run                  try                      Main frame  new Main                     frame.setVisibletrue                  catch Exception e                      e.printStackTrace                                                         Create the frame.           public Main          setDefaultCloseOperationJFrame.EXITONCLOSE         setBounds100, 100, 450, 300         contentPane  new JPanel         contentPane.setBordernew EmptyBorder5, 5, 5, 5         contentPane.setLayoutnew BorderLayout0, 0         setContentPanecontentPane                     JTabbedPane tabbedPane  new JTabbedPaneJTabbedPane.TOP         contentPane.addtabbedPane, BorderLayout.CENTER                    JPanel panelA  new JPanel         tabbedPane.addTabTab A, null, panelA, null         panelA.setLayoutnew BorderLayout0, 0                    sharedPanel s1  new sharedPanelthis         panelA.adds1, BorderLayout.NORTH                  tfPanelA  new JTextField         panelA.addtfPanelA         tfPanelA.setColumns10                     JPanel panelB  new JPanel         tabbedPane.addTabTab B, null, panelB, null         panelB.setLayoutnew BorderLayout0, 0                    sharedPanel s2  new sharedPanelthis         panelB.adds2, BorderLayout.NORTH         tfPanelB  new JTextField         panelB.addtfPanelB         tfPanelB.setColumns10           codepre  p Shared Class...p  precode    public class sharedPanel extends JPanel       private Main app     private String[] clist  Apples,Oranges,Bananas            Create the panel.           public sharedPanelfinal Main app          this.appapp         setLayoutnew FlowLayoutFlowLayout.CENTER, 5, 5                  JComboBoxltStringgt comboBox  new JComboBoxltStringgt         comboBox.setModelnew DefaultComboBoxModelltStringgtclist                  comboBox.addItemListenernew ItemListener              public void itemStateChangedItemEvent e               update PanelAs textfield ONLY if called from PanelA               do this if called from PanelA                 app.tfPanelA.setTexte.getItem.toString                  do this if called from PanelB                 app.tfPanelB.setTexte.getItem.toString                                        addcomboBox               codepre

Negative 26762 pMy current project requires me to utilize pairs of Strings for various use cases. I am currently using the Apache Lang3 Pair tuple to handle this case. The current implementation looks like the following p  precodeprivate ListltPairltString, Stringgtgt configParameters private ListltPairltString, Stringgtgt sensorReadingMeasures codepre  pAfter discussion with the rest of the team it was decided that because we would need to expose these pairs of strings it would be best to find native Java solution.  p  pI have attempted to find a solution using the AbstractMap in the java util library but I havent had much luck being able to instantiate it, and a google search hasnt provided much information on helping me along. p  pI have attempted to recreate the above by doing, p  precodeAbstractMapltString, Stringgt pair  new AbstractMapltString, Stringgt codepre  pI would be able to pull the required information using the keyset function and pulling the needed information out by the get function for each key value. p  pBeyond my instantiation problem this seems like a terribly inefficient way to get the same functionality, and I am curious if there is a better option. If there isnt can someone please provide an example on how to instantiate an AbstractMap appropriately. p

Negative 26762 pMy goal is to parse a TableOfContents element in a Google Document and write it to another one. I want to do this for every document in a folder. Having gone to the bother of converting each document to the type generated by DocsList just so I can use this method [ which a document generated by DocumentApp does not have. Why, I dont understand, because otherwise the two documents are similar when it comes to finding parts. ], I find that what I get back is a SearchResult. How is this elusive construction used Ive tried converting it into a TableOfContents element [ ele  searchResult.asTableOfContents ], which does not error out, but nothing I do allows me parse through its child elements to recover their text works. Interestingly enough, if you get a TableOfContents element by parsing through the documents paragraphs to get it, THAT lets you parse the TOC.p  pWould someone speak to this question.

Negative 26762 pLet say that I have an image with the size 200x200px. I also have two separate webpages. The first page has an image tag with the attributes codewidth100 height100code so the image is downsampled by half. The second page has an image tag with the attributes codewidth400 height400code so the image is oversampled to the double the original size.p  pWhich one of the cases is computationally faster to execute a hrefhttpen.wikipedia.orgwikiDownsampling relnofollowDownsamplinga or a hrefhttpen.wikipedia.orgwikiOversampling relnofollowoversamplinga. Other names for the operation would be subsampling and a hrefhttpen.wikipedia.orgwikiInterpolation relnofollowinterpolationa or just decreasing image size and increasing it. My guts tell me that there is less to compute when decreasing the image size but Im not sure.p  pIt is true that with just one small image the difference is meaningless. And of course the best solution would be to avoid scaling of images in the first place.

Negative 26762 pI am just now taking my first read of the knockout library websites Getting Started documentation, and have a question about how to specify the target of the emthisem keyword in the callback function sent to the knockout strongsubscribestrong function, in the context of tracking changes to a emsetem of objects whose properties are being observed. p  pI need to track 100 objects whose properties are initially null.

When any property in the view model changes from null to a value, or from one value to another value, emI want to know which object the change occurred inem, e.g. stronga88strong. p  precode           myViewModel.personName.subscribemyCallback, , change            myViewModel.personAge.subscribemyCallback, , change codepre  pKnowing which property was changed would be good too, but its more important that I know the object whose property has changed.p

This control works as expect  emwhenem the script resource is loaded however, the problematic issue is the script resource is emnotem always loaded.p  pThe control loads all the appropriate referenced resources when loaded from a Full PostBack. This is not terribly surprising. The control works. It follows the appropriate codeIScriptControlcode rules, registers the Script Control and renders the appropriate Script Descriptors.

Negative 26762 pSo we have a WCF Data Service exposing OData with an Entity Framework v5.6 model. Since we wanted to filter the data based on authentication and access control, some a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibrarydd74484228vvs.11029.aspx relnofollowQuery Interceptorsa were added. At first, all they had to do was get the users scope and match that to an entitys property  something like thisp  pre classlangcs prettyprintoverridecode[QueryInterceptorEntity] public ExpressionltFuncltEntity, boolgtgt EntitiesInterceptor       Get user scope     string userScope  GetUserScope     return entity gt entity.Scope.StartsWithuserScope  codepre  pThis worked as expected, and everything was well with the world. Later on, we wanted to evolve the interceptor to allow matching with a list of scopes. So we changed the code to something like thisp  pre classlangcs prettyprintoverridecode Get user scopes string[] validScopes  GetUserScopes return entity gt validUnits.Anyscope gt entity.Scope.StartsWithscope codepre  pThis seemed to work as long as our OData requests didnt expand beyond one level of relations. So, for instance, stuff likep  ul liODataService.svcEntityexpandOtherEntityli liODataService.svcEntityexpandOtherEntity,AnotherEntityli ul  p...would process just fine. However, when we start querying deeper relationsp  ul liODataService.svcEntityexpandOtherEntityYetAnotherEntityli ul  pWe start getting an Object reference not set to an instance of an Object error from System.Entity.Data. The stack trace is really long and mentions lots of classes on the System.Data namespace. Sadly, it does not mention any line in our code.p  pa hrefhttpwww.filedropper.comstacktrace relnofollowLink to full stack traceap  pIt seems to us that the problem is on how EF is converting our lambda expressions to queries.

For example, when the program should output p  blockquote   pO dsofp blockquote  pAnd cout prints the right output, the .txt file has thisp  blockquote   pOp blockquote  pI have even tried adding the characters into a string before outputting it but it doesnt help. My best guess is that the characters are combining together and getting a different value for unicode or ascii but I dont know enough about character codes to know for sure or  how to stop this from happening. Is there a way to correct the output so that it doesnt do this I am currently using a windows 8.1 computer with codeblocks 12.11 and the GNU GCC compiler in case that helps.p

Negative 26762 pRecently I studied a lot related to XSS attacks. I was searching for prevention techniques of XSS attack. p  pI came across a library called Antisamy, suggested by OWASP.

It is merely a way to make sure HTML, CSS and JavaScript input strictly follows rules defined by a policy filep  pAlso I have read about a HTTP response header called Content Security Policy CSP. It allows you to create a whitelist of sources of trusted content, and instructs the browser to only execute or render resources from those sources. p  pSo should I use only Antisamy or CSP or using both will be beneficial p  pThank you in advance.p

Negative 26762 pI am working through a set of online exercises found at Codingbat.com for my own amusement. One set of exercises focuses on recursive programming. In one of those exercises I wrote the following function to return the frequency of char x within a passed stringp  precode       public int countXString str  Given a string, compute recursively no loops the number of lowercase x  chars in the string.             if str.lengthlt 1                 return 0             else if str.charAt0  x                 return countXstr.substring1  1             else                 return countXstr.substring1               codepre  pAccording to the Codingbat site, this worked fine.p  pThe next exercise was to count the frequency of the emsubstringem hi within a string. I tried to adapt my previous method, using codesubstringcode instead of codecharAtcodep  precode       public int countHiString str  Given a string, compute recursively no loops the number of times lowercase  hi appears in the string.               if str.lengthlt 2                 return 0             else if str.substring0, 1.equalshi                 return countHistr.substring1  1             else                 return countHistr.substring1               codepre  pHowever, this always returns 0. It looks like the testing conditionp  precode else if str.substring0, 1.equalshi codepre  pis never met, but I cant work out why. Hope someone can helpp  pstrongEDIT strongp  pAs Steve and JustinKSU pointed out, I was returning a single character substring. I thought that the index numbers in the codesubstringcode method referred to the index of characters as if they were stored in an array where 0 would be first character, 1 second etc. It looks like a better way to think about it is that the codesubstringcode indexes represent the count of character separators in the string, starting with a separator preceding the first character, such that codesubstring0, 1code emencapsulatesem the first character.p

Negative 26762 pIm using Amazon Web Services to create an autoscaling group of application instances behind an Elastic Load Balancer. Im using a CloudFormation template to create the autoscaling group  load balancer and have been using Ansible to configure other instances.p  pIm having trouble wrapping my head around how to design things such that when new autoscaling instances come up, they can automatically be provisioned by Ansible that is, without me needing to find out the new instances hostname and run Ansible for it. Ive looked into Ansibles codeansiblepullcode feature but Im not quite sure I understand how to use it. It requires a central git repository which it pulls from, but how do you deal with sensitive information which you wouldnt want to commitp  pAlso, the current way Im using Ansible with AWS is to create the stack using a CloudFormation template, then I get the hostnames as output from the stack, and then generate a hosts file for Ansible to use. This doesnt feel quite right  is there best practice for thisp

Negative 26762 pLets remind about relationships between docx and picturesp  pAs I understand .docx  stores original picturespictures at the moment when you copypaste it to Word. And every time when you use that picture Word makes a link to original picture. But if you make some changes to that picture for example resize, crop or change color Word remembers your changes modifying the link add some special tags.  Thats great, because you will never lose quality of your picturep  pLets get picture from our .docx file. To do that I use next code snippetp  precodeXWPFDocument wordDoc  new XWPFDocument pathToFile  for XWPFParagraph p  wordDoc.getParagraphs      for XWPFRun run  p.getRuns          for XWPFPicture pic  run.getEmbeddedPictures              byte [] img  pic.getPictureData.getData              file  outputfile  new File  pathToOutputFile                              BufferedImage image  ImageIO.readimg             ImageIO.writeimage , png, outputfile                codepre  pBut actually that way I get original pictures from .docx, but if you crop some girls from your favourite picture and give me the rest then I always find them in outputfile.

Negative 26762 pThere are a couple of similar questionsanswers out there, but I havent been able to apply them.  Im pretty green.  Any help is appreciated.p  pIm working with CubePortfolio  Its a jquery based, filterable project gallery.  Each project has the option to either load a more detailed project popup page using ajax or to open a lightbox which can then be clicked through to view the cover photos for each project.p  pUltimately, Im trying to add the same lightbox functionality to the ajax loaded popup page so the user can then click through the photos specific to that project.p  pBefore requesting the ajax content, thats as simple as adding the .cbplightbox class to my  code.  Once the ajax is loaded however, that no longer works.  p  pIm pretty sure that I understand that I need to recall better term the JS once the ajax content is loaded, but the lightbox functionality is built in with the rest of the JS code for the filters, responsive grid, etc and uses the delegate .cpblightbox.  Im lost and hoping someone can point me in the right direction.p  pThe page in question is a hrefhttpwww.4sdesignstudio.comMetalsetprojects.htmlcbp..Metalsetcubeportfolioajaxlafayetteveterans.html relnofollowhttpwww.4sdesignstudio.comMetalsetprojects.htmlcbp..Metalsetcubeportfolioajaxlafayetteveterans.htmlap  pWorking code within my base page projects.html  The first  pulls in the ajax loaded popup.

Negative 26762 pTo fix the auto scaling issues to render my webpage on an iOS device, Ive added the viewport meta tag,p  precodeltmeta nameviewport contentwidthdevicewidth,initialscale1,maximumscale1,minimum  scale1,userscalablenogt  codepre  pand Ive added device specific styling through media queries for iPhone and iPad, This fixed the scaling issues on switching between portraitlandscape orientations. The problem now is that when I shift focus to an input fieldbringing the keyboard up and shifting to landscape orientation with the keyboard onauto scaling  happens fine and when I switch orientation back to portrait modewith the keyboard still on, the UI gets distorted, i.e., some extra length gets added to the viewport width which either appears as black area or part of the same viewport being repeated again. And if I bring down the keyboard and switch orientations again, the added space gets removed and the UI gets back to normal again. This happens only with the keyboard on.

If codemyFunccode emit progress events, I will loose this as well.p  pSo the question is how to modify codetimeoutcode function so it can accept functions returning promises without loosing their errorsprogress informationp
Negative 26762 pI have seen a number of variations of this question where all the answers simply suggest removing the codecoffeerailscode gem from the codeGemfilecode a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions8722195howcanicompletelydisablecoffeescriptinarails31appthis onea and a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions6112155rails31howtopreventrailstousecoffescriptthis onea.p  pThis is not the answer that I am looking for. I may still want to write some CoffeeScript in the project, I just want JavaScript code.jscode to be the default for the Rails generators.p  pThis also means the suggestions to emrename code.js.coffeecode to code.jscodeem strongevery timestrong I generate code is not a desirable solution.p  pIs there some sort of configuration in Rails I can change to make code.jscode the default, but still leave CoffeeScript enabled Asset Pipeline should still be able to transpile an code.js.coffeecode files that I may writep
Negative 26762 pI have a viewPager with 52 images which are taken from an array. The problem is that it was working well, but, I wanted to add something like a frame to each image I have in viewPager, and then, the problems start. When I slide through images, it laggs and at some point crashes. I know that the problem is the size of the pictures, which is almost 1mb for each one, but how should I do it not to lag and crash anymore How should I edit it, but keep my images the same and make it working properly Thanks p  pMainActivity.javap  precodepackage com.descoper.rom  import java.io.IOException  import android.app.Activity import android.app.Dialog import android.app.WallpaperManager

Negative 26762 pI have been making a project in libGDX and started in v0.9.9, I just got a mac in order to get it on ios, and after a series of figuring out the new libGDX and robovm updates and weighing options through a variety of trial and error i am going to have to update everything to the new libgdx 1.2.0 structure gradle, etc.. This came with the addition of viewports and messed up the way stages work. Orginally in my constructor I would start by creating an orthograhiccamera and stage, iep  precodecamera  new OrthographicCamera854, 480  stage  new Stage codepre  pI cant figure out how to factor the camera into the new code because I know somewhere i need to create a viewport for the stage but im not sure how my camera needs to work with it. All that shows up is just a white screen. Now after repeatedly fiddling with how i have a random made viewport, camera and stage setup, I actually got it to show the main menu buttons, but over blank white when there should be 3 moving backgrounds it makes a cool paralax effect... and moving title along with it. Could this be how libGDX now uses openGL 2.0 instead of 1.0 These button actors are also completely unresponsive, they should be animated when clicked, and change screen, and output to the console but do not do anything. I have always had the stage as the inputprocessor set in the show method, and add all of my actors aswell, iep  precodeOverride public void show      Gdx.input.setInputProcessorstage     stage.addActorvariousActors   codepre  pCould the whiteness be opengl not being able to process the images and showing white instead Could this be because of lack of ram never a problem before whether on 20mb of available ram or 8gb available, could it be that the images being used are too large largest being 3840 x 1080 In my render isp  precodepublic void renderfloat delta      Gdx.gl.glClearColor1F, 1F, 1F, 1F     Gdx.gl.glClearGL20.GLCOLORBUFFERBIT      batch.setProjectionMatrixcamera.combined     camera.update      stage.actdelta     batch.begin      batch.end         stage.draw     System.out.printlnmenuscreen rendering   codepre  pAll actorselements are initialized in the constructorp  pMy entire game is actually built out of scene2d elements it did actually work out really well  so getting this to work means the whole game.

Negative 26762 pAs I understand, calculation at compile time means, that at runtime instead of constexpr functions there will be const values by definition, because they will be already calculated. That touches functions they already calculated, so, it is just as variable of function type, that touches variables it is just as static const variable, same with classes.p  pOne plus from constexpr function I see if in ANSI C, for example, I had to have 5 defines, maybe united logically, now I can write one such function and use it instead of 5 defines, being able to write logic to manipulate of set of constexpr function return values. So, as result I have same set of 5 values, but now I described them logically, writing such function.p  pBut I feel I understand something wrong, because I see such examplesp  precodeclass vec3          union                  struct                          float x, y, z                                  float v[3]           public         constexpr vec3 x0, y0, z0            constexpr vec3float x, float y, float z xx, yy, zz 1         constexpr vec3const vec3amp  default  2         vec3 ampoperatorconst vec3amp  default  3         constexpr float x  return x   4         constexpr float y  return y          constexpr float z  return z          constexpr const float v  return v   5         float v  return v   codepre  p1 I can understand if constructor without parameters is constexpr. Yes, it is some const state that can be calculated at compile time and use in future, maybe faster. But why constructor with parameters Object body will be on Stack or on Heap, we dont know which parameters we will put there, what for is it p  p2, 3 Same here, what for is it How can we calculate at compile time copying of unknown objectp  p4, 5 I wonder what for it can be used. Just for object which state was calculated at compile time Or calling value of some object that will be created at runtime from Heap or Stack may costs much and that somehow will speed it onp

I like the idea of being able to query different data structures for different services. Im essentially wanting to sync MongoDB, Neo4jTitan, SQL, and maybe CassandraHbase.p  pCurrently, Im wrapping everything in a trycatch block and rolling them all back if one fails. However, this is taxing my write times. Ive also looked into AMQP systems like Kafka or ZeroMQ, but these seem more big data centric, whereas my app is still small and I want to keep it efficient. p  pHas anyone had experience with this Is a MQ a good idea for a small app or am I prematurely optimizingp  pThanksp

Negative 26762 pI want to dive a little bit deeper into erlang and because I have a computer game background I thought to make a very simple game server, nothing fancy.  I am thinking about making a world of interconnected solar systems but I am not sure how to represent the hierarchical structure in supervisors and genservers. p  pOne way to look at it would be that the solar system, the planets, etc would be supervisors that watch over their children. This does not work I suppose, because supervisors are not meant to store state and the each planet, moon etc has a state.  That means that everything must be a genserver and that leads to the conclusion that I need to create a hierarchy of genservers.  How does that fit into the concept of supervisors and genserversp

Do you know of a equivalent. Or if you have an idea on how to approach this perhaps p  pWhat i have right now is in my php page that displays stuff, i make 3 separate requests to this class, and each request has a unique flag p  pso i.e. p  precodewww.something.comstuff1stuff1ampflag1 www.something.comstuff1stuff1ampflag2  codepre  pand so on, and that returns 3 different figures that i then display on the Page. It works but its not great and i want to make it nicer  p  pstrongEDITstrongp  pI am using Spring Framework for this appp  pOk So here are the SQL queries i am running against the DB.p  precodepublic String query1          setCurrentPhone 1         return select sumcase when calltimelt60 then 0.035 else ceilingcalltime3.510601000 end from call where accountid  account.getId and oqannounced is not null                   and calledback is null or not calledback2 and agentid is not null and entrygtaccount.getFromDate and entry lt account.getToDate   public String query2          setCurrentPhone 2         return select count1 from call where accountid  account.getId and agentid is not null and calledback2 and entrygtaccount.getFromDate and entry lt account.getToDate   public String query3          setCurrentPhone 3         return select sumcase when calltimelt60 then 0.004 else ceilingcalltime0.410601000 end from call where accountid  account.getId and oqannounced is null                   and calledback is null or not calledback2 and agentid is not null and entrygtaccount.getFromDate and entry lt account.getToDate     codepre  pSo previously stated that i need to run against 3 different tabled and in fact i do apologize but i was wrong its the same table, so i presume there is a way of joining and possibly refactoring these SQL statements.

Negative 26762 pIn swift, Im adding subviews programmatically via a button. The subviews can be as thin as 256 points, which means they could appear horizontally once on an iPhone and 3 times on an iPad in portrait. In landscape, they could fit twice across a 4 inch iphone in landscape, or four times on an iPad. Ultimately, Id like any number of subviews to appear horizontally, aligned to the leading edge left of the superview in order from 1st to last, but strongwrapping according to device size and rotation,strong and the button to appear below the last subview added.p  pId have thought this would be a fairly common design pattern for iOS  fully covered by an adaptive system like Autolayout  but I cant find a clear example of how to do this in code. Ive watched all the WWDC videos on Autolayout and tried a few approaches, but solutions a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions19808739howtouseautolayouttopositionuibuttonsinhorizontallineswrappingleftlq1like this onea, seem to depend upon the orientation as the view is added, rather than responding to changes in orientation. I must be using the wrong search terms.p

Negative 26762 pUpgraded Telerik in my ClickOnce application to version 2014.3.1202.40. Never sure of the best way to do this. After the install, all my references to Telerik controls was broken and I had to remove all Telerik references in each of the projects and readd them. So, I may be upgrading in the wrong way. But thats another matter.p  pI deploy my app to a staging folder on my web server before moving to production. The app is signed with a commercial code signing certificate from Comodo that doesnt expire until 2019. Ive uploaded new versions many times with no problem. But now, since I upgraded the Telerik controls, I cant download the and install the application. Heres what happensp  ol liIn Chrome, I enter the url a hrefhttpporpoiseanalytics.comPorpoiseStagingsetup.exe relnofollowhttpporpoiseanalytics.comPorpoiseStagingsetup.exeali liI get the Not commonly downloaded warning where I never got that before. I dont get any error on Firefox nor on IE.li liIf I tell Chrome to keep the file, I can start it. The installation starts on all the other browsers too.li liAbout 34 of the way through the download of the files, Avast blocks it with DRep virus Im guessing lack of reputation. If I turn off Avast, it installs fine. ClickOnce install log shows an error Exception occurred loading manifest from file [application].exe the manifest may not be valid or the file could not be opened.li ol  pWhy is my application suddenly acting like it has no reputation when its been downloaded for months with no problems. But, after I modify the application in VS2010 and then remove and readd the Telerik dlls, I suddenly have no reputation. And what makes matters worse, is that now my production download located at ttpporpoiseanalytics.comPorpoiseDownloadsetup.exe is suddenly acting the same way.p  pI admit I dont have a good enough understanding of reputation, signing, and clickonce. But I do know that whereas before we were fine, after deploying the application, were flagged as malicious software. I made a few code changes in the program not many, but I also replaced the Telerik dlls. Probably has something to do with signing and publishing, but I cant figure it out. Please help. Thanks.p

Negative 26762 pWe are building clientserver application. Client is a WPF application using Entity Framework with SQL Server CE as database. Server is a simple web service.p  pClient is using SQL Server CE for storing data, however at fixed intervals we are sending data from client to server. We are doing this because client can work totally offline and so as soon as its online data are send to server. What we noticed is that when user save some data and transaction is committed data are not immediately in database. p  pI know its because of how SQL Server CE works and that data are pushed to database file at certain intervals. It can be changed by setting flush interval  1, however I think its not working as its supposed to or we are doing something wrong, which of course is possible. Because of that when transaction was committed in one thread and we read database in thread that sends data to server we sometimesits not very often but for us its totally unacceptable  get data from SQL Server CE cache. p  pIf that happens and client send data to server and in same moment app crash or user close it we have client and server databases in totally inconsistent state. That behaviour was our mistake because we were not waiting for sending thread to finish on app close and connection wasnt disposed correctly. p  pHowever Im still not confident if thats enough. Is there any way to be 100 sure that all transactions that were committed are really persisted in the SQL Server CE database filep

Negative 26762 pI have an XSLT stylesheet that consumes a document and outputs a SOAP message, where the body is in a specific format defined by a WCF data contract not specified here. The issue is that WCF has a peculiar notion of what constitutes alphabetical ordering and considers the following order to be correctp  ul liACli liAbli ul  pThis is because it uses ordinal string comparison internally. The details are not interesting, suffice to say that XSLT codeltsortgtcode doesnt natively support this ordering but in order to transform an input document whose format may vary, into an acceptable SOAP message, the stylesheet must be able to order the output elements according to this peculiar ordering.

Negative 26762 pI have an issue, I am working on a jython project while editing it with Notepad.  Im having an issue where I save the file, open it in normal notepad.exe and the file comes out completely different to how i edited it on Notepad.

Negative 26762 pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.com7MBAc.jpg altFlow of Hexagonal Architecturep  pI have read different sources about Ports amp Adapters architecture proposed by Alistair Cockburn and find it apt for my scenario of developing a gateway service application which receives message from multiple sources and process the message and send the message to multiple destinations. Here is my implementation in detail.p  ul liCurrently the source of message is singleJMS Queueli liThe JMS Port subscribes to the JMS Message Queue and passes it to JMS Adapter which in turn invokes the corresponding message handler.li liThe Message handler in turn calls the business domain layer which is strongindependent of the source or destination of messagestrong as proposed by cockburn.li liThe Message handler which has JMS Port,WCF Port,DB Port,TCP Port injected by dependency injection container in turn invokes the JMS Port,TCP Port and WCF Port to publishsend the domain processed message.li ul  pI have several key questionsdoubts if whether i have deviated from Cockburns proposed architecture.p  ol liCan a single Port handle both inflowoutflow of messageIn this case JMS Port. Or is it a good practice to have seperate ports for inflow and outflow of messages.li ol  p2.As per the cockburns article it saysp  pstrongInbound communication As events arrive from the outside world at a port, a technologyspecific adapter converts it into a usable procedure call or message and passes it to the application.strongp  pstrongOutbound communication When the application has something to send out, it sends it out through a port to an adapter, which creates the appropriate signals needed by the receiving technology human or automated.strongp  pSo i have passed on the processed message directly to the port which in turn calls the adapter to transform the message as per the destination requirements.p  ol start3 lipCan Message Handlers Application Layer have the dependency of Ports injected pli lipAs per the article by Cockburn it sayspli ol  pstrongThere will typically be multiple adapters for any one port, for various technologies that may plug into that port.strong p  pI cant think of a scenario where mulitple adapters are required for a single port. Can you throw me a scenario so that i can leverage the architecture to the fullest.p

But when I try to plot linear trend with lm, I can get the error message  formula.defaultobject, env  baseenv  invalid formula p  pAnd when I try to plot the linear trend with abline, I get the error message  Error  operator is invalid for atomic vectors p  pMy code is below. So can anyone help me draw linear trend with lm or abline I check the web to see how lm or abline is used. Some examples used formula for lm and abline, but I didnt understand what kind of formula i should use. p  precodeSEread.csvfileSE1.csv,headTRUE,sep  PriceltSEClosingprice  Price.SEKlttsPrice, start2011  plotPrice.SEK,mainStockholm 30 Index from August 2011 to March 2015,lwd1,col4  strPrice.SEK  lm.01ltlmPrice.SEK codepre

Also, in that example, red cells would have precedence over black and black over blue.

Negative 26762 pI know the way that python acts with circular imports through creating references in codesys.modulescode.

If you test an instance of codeb.Errcode with codeisinstancecode function and codea.Errcode class you will get codeFalsecode. So the only way to catch the exception is to use codeb.Errcode instead of codeErrcode. But its not what we expect at first sight and its not what we want.p  pstrongThe solutionstrong that I know is to create a new module codec.pycode and define codeErrcode class in it. Then both codea.pycode and codeb.pycode should import codeErrcode from codec.pycode. It solves this problem.p  pstrongButstrong is there a solution that allow us to define codeErrcode in codea.pycode Note that the problem is not just about exception classes, any python class may fall into this pit based on how we use its objects in our code.p

How can i make windows machine to get to understand the different file structure  Maybe there are some guides  I do not want to switch to Linux.

Negative 26762 pHello CodeIgniter users.p  pI have a problem with flash data and I would like some help. My CI version is 2.1.4.p  pI am using CI flash data to store data temporarily for a form that consists of multiple pages. Data entered on each page is stored so it can be accessed on the next pages and finally all data is entered int the database.p  pNow to keep data stored through multiple pages, instead of only one, I extended the Session class with the following functionp  precodefunction keepallflashdataprefix        userdata  thisgtalluserdata     foreach userdata as key gt value              if strposkey, old . prefix                      newflashdatakey  strreplaceold, new, key             thisgtsetuserdatanewflashdatakey, value                codepre  pThis function preserves all flash data or optionally only flash data that starts with a certain string for another redirect. It is similar to the codekeepflashdatacode function except for the fact that it works for multiple items without requiring their exact name.p  pAfter calling this function, both codeoldcode and codenewcode keys are stored in the session data. Then after a redirect, old keys are removed and new keys are set to old. Then, if theres another page, I call codekeepallflashdatacode again and so on until the last page.p  pThis works fine when Im working on my local WAMP server, but on my actual server, all flashdata just gets removed after a redirect, even if it has codenewcode in the key. I confirmed my codekeepallflashdatacode function works by checking the contents of codesessiongtalluserdatacode and everything looks as expected.p  pI am using some AJAX calls, but they should not erase flash data a known issue as Ive prevented this with codethisgtCIgtinputgtisajaxrequestcode before flashdata is cleared in the codesessupdatecode and codeflashdatasweepcode functions.p  pIs this a bug in CodeIgniter or am I doing something wrong Any help is appreciated.p

Negative 26762 pI know there are threads out there on this topic but do seem to answer quite what I am looking for.  I have never done any push technology before so some guidance here is appreciated.  I understand how when something has changed that that triggers the push to any browser that is listening but I do not think that quite fits the scenario that I am looking at trying to do.p  pWe are rebuilding our users web application where they track shipments.  We will be allowing the users to build there own searches that match how they do their job.  For example, some will look for any shipment that is scheduled to deliver today where others look for shipments that are to be picked up today and still other that look for shipments that need to be scheduled for pickup.  So when they come in an open the application I can give them a count for each of their work tasks that they need to do today.  So now what I want is that the count will change based on the SQL being rerun.  But I do not want the user to have to refresh the page to see the new count.p  pHow do I have this SQL run and push the current count to any browser that is using this SQL.  What is the mechanism that automatically reruns this SQL  Keep in mind that I will have 50 or more of these unique SQLs that will need to be executed and the count pushed.p  pThanks for your guidancep

Negative 26762 pI have a ListView which is supposed to display a rather large number of items comprised of a Name, a Thumbnail and a AnimationPosition property. A background task in each items type is in charge of switching the thumbnails in order to animate them.p  pNow it goes without saying that this is a rather heavy operation and should be limited to as few items as possible e.g. to visiblerealizing items of a Virtualized ListView.

I suspect my XAML somehow kills the Virtualization and have tried many solutions with no success. Mind you I need my ListView to be scalable to the MainWindows dimensions and not be of fixed hight and width.li liI need to call StartAnimation when an item is about to be realized and StopAnimation when it has left the view.li ol  pEven though my ListView is not correctly Virtualized, if my understanding of how ObservableCollections work is correct, its only the UI representation of the items that are managed by the Virtualization and not the items themselves i.e. calling the StartAnimationStopAnimation from the ConstructorDestructor of the items dont help much as they are called for every single item at the time of creation anyway. p  pIs there a neat way to somehow inform each item that they are about to be realized or leave the ListView viewp  pstrongUpdatestrong The issue of virtualizing not working correctly was related to the emWrapPanelem and once I switched to emVirtualizingStackPanelem it started to work correctly. Unfortunately its not exactly the same as a emWrapPanelem and since .NET framework does not offer a emVirtualizingWrapPanelem, I chose to use the one from a hrefhttpsvirtualwrappanel.codeplex.com relnofollowherea. Its not perfect but it does the job.p
Negative 26762 pI am dynamically inserting a table row or multiple rows into a table upon an ajax calls return. I am looking to accomplish this by having an empty container type element inside of my html table that I can insert codelttrgtcode elements into. As I have seen from other posts, a div cannot hold a tr element, so my question is, is there a particular way that I can insert the html for rows into a table It must be dynamic in nature, or in other words I need to be able to hold more than just one codelttrgtcode. Thanks in advancep
Negative 26762 pI have found answers regarding searching for duplicates of an entry in one column, but I want to search for duplicates of a combination of entries of two columns.p  pI have the columns Area, Status, and Update Date as parts of my table. There are 3 different areas and 2 statuses, but there are duplicates among combinations. By that, I mean that area1,status1 could have been updated at times t1, t2, and t3. I want to find the earliest instance first entry in the Update Date column FOR EACH area,status combination for a total of 6 rows in my output. Is this possiblep  pFor example, for this one id, I need 6 rows. The code below outputs a table of 12 rows for the given id because there are area,status duplicatesp  precodeselect id, area, status, updatedate from history where area in a, b, c         and status in done,pending and requestid  123 order by updatedate desc codepre  pEDIT Sorry. I know this is confusing. Ill write it out the long way to hopefully clear things up. For id1, I need the most uptodate a1,s1, a1,s2, a2,s1, a2,s2, a3,s1, and a3,s2. Then I need those for id2, then id3, and so on.p  pHope that makes sense and helps a bit more.p

I think its possible a hrefhttpsinstagram.comdeveloperendpointsusers relnofollowhttpsinstagram.comdeveloperendpointsusersa, but since I am a complete noob in python and django I dont know how to exactly do it. p  pSo I found this signal from the djangoallauth docs codeallauth.socialaccount.signals.presocialloginrequest, sociallogincode so this states that I can check that the user has signed up using a social account, but how would I use it with my createuserprofile function The steps that I thought of is to first create the profile which I did and then to check whether the user signed up using a social account or not, if they did then the useravatar which use their instagram profile picture and if not it would stay as none.p  pAnd as a plus I know that I can fetch the users social account profile picture in a template using codeuser.socialaccountset.all.0.getavatarurlcode, but I dont want to do it via templates rather than doing it via Models which is the best way.p  pThis might look really stupid but I gave it a go and tried to come up with something this is what a newbie thinks would work, I thought this on top of my head, as I have no idea if this how signals workp  precodedef createuserprofilesender, instance, created, kwargs     if created         UserProfile.objects.createuserinstance         def presocialloginrequest, sociallogin             userloggedsocial  sociallogin.account.user             if userloggedsocial                 UserProfile.objects.getuseravataruserloggedsocial.profilepicture             else                 pass postsave.connectcreateuserprofile, senderUser codepre  pstrongUPDATEstrong Got it working with the help of bellum Thank youp  pHere is the code that I usedp  pemmodels.pyemp  precodeclass UserProfilemodels.Model     user  models.OneToOneFieldUser, relatednameprofile     useravatar  models.ImageFielduploadtoprofileimages                                 blankTrue,                                 defaultNone       def unicodeself         return self.user.username      class Meta         verbosenameplural  User Profiles  def createuserprofilesender, instance, created, kwargs     if created         UserProfile.objects.createuserinstance postsave.connectcreateuserprofile, senderUser codepre  pem3utils.pyemp  precodedef downloadfilefromurlurl      Stream the image from the url     try         request  requests.geturl, streamTrue     except requests.exceptions.RequestException as e          TODO log error here         return None      if request.statuscode  requests.codes.ok          TODO log error here         return None       Create a temporary file     lf  tempfile.NamedTemporaryFile       Read the streamed image in sections     for block in request.itercontent1024  8           If no more file then stop         if not block             break           Write image block to temporary file         lf.writeblock      return files.Filelf  class SocialAccountAdapterDefaultSocialAccountAdapter     def saveuserself, request, sociallogin, formNone         user  superSocialAccountAdapter, self.saveuserrequest, sociallogin, form          url  sociallogin.account.getavatarurl         avatar  downloadfilefromurlurl         if avatar             profile  user.profile   access your profile from user by correct name             profile.useravatar.saveavatard.jpg  user.pk, avatar         return user codepre  pemsettings.pyemp  precodeSOCIALACCOUNTADAPTER  main.s3utils.SocialAccountAdapter codepre  pThe signal for creating the profile on sign up in my models was left the same, just added an SocialAccountAdapterp

The Space will associate Admins through codespacerolesspaceadminscode join table name depends on the design decision I am trying to make. I am using a Role model to create the association between Spaces and Admins. This means the the spaceroles table will be a three way join with codeuserid, spaceid and roleidcode columns.p  pI plan to eventually build a bunch of tools around Spaces that the Members will have access to. These might not necessarily be restricted to Members of a certain Space. There most likely will be cases further down the road where Members of one Space can interact across organizational boundaries with Members of another Space using the Space as the scope e.g. a fan of one sports team could join in on a discussion on the wall of another sports team where sports team is an analogy for Space. p  pMy question is should I just create another Role called member or should I break members out into another model Member with an association through spacemembers Please explain the advantagesdisadvantages of your recommendation as best as possible.p

Negative 26762 pI am trying to document a repeatable process for developers here to get clean copies of an ionic project from GitHub and then populate the plugins and platforms folders of the project. My codepackage.jsoncode has the codecordovaPluginscode and codecordovaPlatformscode listed.  Here are the steps I am tryingp  precode git clone ltrepourlgt  cd ltprojectdirgt  npm install  bower install  ionic state restore codepre  pThis almost does what I expect, but not quite.  I get the codepluginscode folder populated with all of the plugin source files.  I also get the codeplatformsioscode folder populated with the project for iOS.  The problem is, none of the codeafterplatformaddcode scripts in the plugins are run.p  pIt seems like the order of operations when running the codeionic state restorecode command might be the issue.  It adds the platforms listed in the package.json before fetching the plugins.p  pThe only workaround I have been able to come up with is to ask each developer to run codeionic platform remove ioscode followed by codeionic platform add ioscode.  The downside of having them do this is it causes the codepackage.jsoncode file to be touched.  This then results in developers needlessly committing changes in codepackage.jsoncode to git.p  pIs there a way to cause the afterplatformadd hook to runp

Negative 26762 pI am generating a data set where I first want to randomly draw a number for each observation from a discrete distribution, fill in codevar1code with these numbers. Next, I want to draw another number from the distribution for each row, but the catch is that the number in codevar1code for this observation is not eligible to be drawn anymore. I want to repeat this a relatively large number of times.p  pTo hopefully make this make more sense, suppose that I start withp  precodeid 1 2 3 ... 999 1000 codepre  pSuppose that the distribution I have is [A, B, C, D, E] that happen with probability [.2, .3, .1, .15, .25].p  pI would first like to randomly draw from this distribution to fill in codevarcode. Suppose that the result of this isp  precodeid    var1 1     E 2     E 3     C ...    999   B 1000  A codepre  pNow codeEcode is not eligible to be drawn for observations code1code and code2code. codeCcode, codeBcode, and codeAcode are ineligible for observations code3code, code999code, and code1000code, respectively.p  pAfter all the columns are filled in, we may end up with thisp  precodeid    var1  var2  var3  var4  var5 1     E     C     B     A     D 2     E     A     B     D     C 3     C     B     A     E     D ...         999   B     D     C     A     E 1000  A     E     B     C     D codepre  pI am not sure of how to approach this in Stata. But one way to fill in codevar1code is to do something likep  precodegen random1  runiform replace var1  A if random1lt.2 replace var1  B if random1gt.2 amp random1lt.5 etc.... codepre  pNote that sticking with the scaled probabilities after creating codevar1code is desirable, but is not required for me.p

Negative 26762 pIm currently developing an app where I need a progress indicator for the processing of a few thousand files. p  pWhile I already figured out that one should do the updating of the progress indicator on the main thread while doing the progressing on a background thread, i would like to know if there are best practices in handling the backgroundthreadltprogressindicator interaction.p  pBelow is the way i do it right knowp  precode[self.loadingBarViewController performSelectorOnMainThreadselectorstartProgressBarWithMaxValue withObjectmax waitUntilDoneNO]   int i  0 for NSURL fileURL in files        Here I process the file      [self.loadingBarViewController performSelectorOnMainThreadselectorsetProgressValue withObjecti waitUntilDoneNO]     i     [self.loadingBarViewController performSelectorOnMainThreadselectorstopProgressBar withObjectnil waitUntilDoneNO] codepre  pI have a few things in mind about itp  ol liShould I update the progress indicator only every ten files or something, so that I dont clog up the main thread too much each file takes only a few milliseconds to processli liShould I wait for the MainThread to be done with the selector I could imagine, that all those selector calls stack up on the main thread so that for example I already processed file 5024 during the thread still updates the progress indicator to 3089li liShould I use more threads to process the files, or does that bring any problems in updating the indicatorli ol  pAny other best practices for dealing with that backgroundthreadltprogressindicator interactionp  pThanks a bunch p
