Positive 7027 pSome days ago i assisted to a project meeting as part of my career and they were discussing about this new product a fiscalization software, in theory a  huge system and had to be a web solution. Somebody asked why not using Symfony2 and the guy i think was the architect toll him that, because the dimensions of the sw and the amount of data maybe a Spring framework was a better approach... and the war began. p  pSo, my question is, in which context is better using one or another framework I dnt think that the language benefits is so important given that php has evolved very much after the 5.4 version, so that of i do this in java but you dont in php is not longer applied. Besides, these both frameworks are great, so where should be or not applied one or anotherp

So, instead to return a view name, I redirect toward another resourcep  precodereturn redirectricercaValidazione codepre  pThen in the same controller class I have declared this method that handle request toward this strongricercaValidazionestrong resourcep  precodeRequestMappingvalue  ricercaValidazione, methodRequestMethod.POST public String ricercaValidazioneModelAttribute ConsultazioneFilter consultazioneFilter, Model model, HttpServletRequest request       RicercaConsultazioneViewObject filtro  null     try          filtro  new ObjectMapper.readValuerequest.getParameterfiltro, RicercaConsultazioneViewObject.class         filtro.setSelStatoProgetto3       Progetti da validare      catch IOException e          logger.errore           consultazioneFilter  new ConsultazioneFilterfiltro     model.addAttributeconsultazioneFilter, consultazioneFilter      model.addAttributelistaProgetti, new ListViewObjectltTwp1007ProgettogtprogettoService.getListaProgettiConsultazioneconsultazioneFilter       return validazionetabellaRisultati  codepre  pThe problem is that it cant work and after the redirection cant enter into the strongricercaValidazionestrong method.p  pI think that maybe the problem is that this strongricercaValidazionestrong method handle strongPOSTstrong request toward the strongricercaValidazionestrong resource and the strongreturn redirectricercaValidazionestrong maybe generate a strongGETstrong request.p  pBut I am not sure about it.p  pWhy What am I missing How can I solve this issuep  pTnx p

Positive 7027 pI want to implement plugin architecture in Spring Boot application. Let me explain my scenario. I have a main application, which starts the server, manages security, etc. The app is like the root of my final product which will include this root app and other plugins added to it. p  pNow, the plugins are Spring Boot application themselves, which I may add to the root app by dynamically searching for jars in the specific path or by added them to project dependency as library. p  pPlugins have their own configurations and are like apps running inside the main root app. Lets say if the root app runs the server, the plugin app may have all the controllers endpoints, beans etc that provide functionality to my product.p  pThis is the premise, now what I want to know is,p  ol liHow can I achieve this architectureli liHow will the root app communicate with the pluginsli liWill they have separate application contextsli liHow can I boot and configure child app from the root appli liWhen the application receives the request from clients how can I route the request to specific controller inside specific plugin considering I may have many plugins.li ol  pI am confused about the concept here, and how it can work. Any sort of help is appreciated. If there is some example that anyone can provide, that will be just wonderful.p

Negative 7027 pHey all, I was looking for an easy way to monitor an object or variable for changes, and I found Object.Watch thats supported in Mozilla browsers, but not IE. So I started searching around to see if anyone had written some sort of equivalent. p  pAbout the only thing Ive found has been a jQuery plugin a hrefhttpplugins.jquery.comfilesjquerywatch.js.txthttpplugins.jquery.comfilesjquerywatch.js.txta, but Im not sure if thats the best way to go. I certainly use jQuery in most of my projects, so Im not worried about the jQuery aspect...p  pAnyway, the question can someone show me a working example of that jQuery plugin Im having problems making it work... p  pOr, does anyone know of any better alternatives that would work cross browser Thanksp  pstrongUpdate after answersstrongp  pThanks everyone for the responses I tried out the code posted here a hrefhttpwebreflection.blogspot.com200901internetexplorerobjectwatch.htmlhttpwebreflection.blogspot.com200901internetexplorerobjectwatch.htmlap  pBut I couldnt seem to make it work with IE. The code below works fine in FireFox, but does nothing in IE. In Firefox, each time watcher.status is changed, the document.write in watcher.watch is called and you can see the output on the page. In IE, that doesnt happen, but I can see that watcher.status is updating the value, because the last document.write shows the correct value in both IE and FF. But, if the callback function isnt called, then thats kind of pointless...  p  pAm I missing somethingp  precodevar options  status no status, watcher  createWatcheroptions  watcher.watchstatus, functionprop, oldValue, newValue      document.writeold   oldValue  , new   newValue  ltbrgt     return newValue   watcher.status  asdf watcher.status  1234  document.writewatcher.status  ltbrgt codepre

Negative 7027 pI have a problem which I believe is the classic masterworker pattern, and Im seeking advice on implementation. Heres what I currently am thinking about the problemp  pTheres a global queue of some sort, and it is a central place where the work to be done is kept. Presumably this queue will be managed by a kind of master object. Threads will be spawned to go find work to do, and when they find work to do, theyll tell the master thing whatever that is to add this to the queue of work to be done.p  pThe master, perhaps on an interval, will spawn other threads that actually perform the work to be done. Once a thread completes its work, Id like it to notify the master that the work is finished. Then, the master can remove this work from the queue.p  pIve done a fair amount of thread programming in Java in the past, but its all been prior to JDK 1.5 and consequently I am not familiar with the appropriate new APIs for handling this case. I understand that JDK7 will have forkjoin, and that that might be a solution for me, but I am not able to use an earlyaccess product in this project.p  pThe problems, as I see them, arep  p1 how to have the threads doing the work communicate back to the master telling them that their work is complete and that the master can now remove the work from the queuep  p2 how to efficiently have the master guarantee that work is only ever scheduled once. For example, lets say this queue has a million items, and it wants to tell a worker to go do these 100 things. Whats the most efficient way of guaranteeing that when it schedules work to the next worker, it gets the next 100 things and not the 100 things Ive already scheduledp  p3 choosing an appropriate data structure for the queue. My thinking here is that the threads finding work to do could potentially find the same work to do more than once, and theyd send a message to the master saying heres work, and the master would realize that the work has already been scheduled and consequently should ignore the message. I want to ensure that I choose the right data structure such that this computation is as cheap as possible.p  pTraditionally, I would have done this in a database, in sort of a finitestatemachine manner, working tasks through from start to complete. However, in this problem, I dont want to use a database because of the high volume and volatility of the queue. In addition, Id like to keep this as lightweight as possible. I dont want to use any app server if that can be avoided.p  pIt is quite likely that this problem Im describing is a common problem with a wellknown name and accepted set of solutions, but I, with my lowly nonCS degree, do not know what this is called i.e. please be gentle.p  pThanks for any and all pointers.p

Negative 7027 pI am building a very dynamic webbased application using a lot of Javascript to handle user events. I am in the process of making things a little more usable and came across a problem that Ive never had before.p  pI am using jQuery, so factor that in to your answers. Thanks in advance.p  pI have a set of button elements defined as p  precodeltinput typebutton titleMy useful text here. disableddisabled gt codepre  pI have these buttons with a default style ofp  precodedivoptionbuttons input       cursor help  codepre  pThen, using jQuery I run something like this as a clickevent on a select boxp  precodewindow.currentcolumn   select.reportoptioncolumns.liveclick, function      var column  this.val     if  column  window.currentcolumn            clear our our previous selections         window.currentcolumn            make this option no longer selected         this.val          divoptionbuttons input.attrdisabled,disabled         divoptionbuttons input.attr             title,             You must select a column from this list.                  divoptionbuttons input.csscursor, help      else          window.currentcolumn  column         divoptionbuttons input.attrdisabled,         divoptionbuttons input.attr             title,             Add this option for the column   column                    divoptionbuttons input.csscursor, default       codepre  pSo, as you can see, when a column is selected in the select box not shown here, I want the button to be enabled and behave like a button would with my own clickevents. But when a column is not selected including the default load, I want the button disabled. The usability developer in me wanted to give the users subtle contextual clues as to what they can do to enable the button through the native rendering of the title attribute as a lightweight tooltip. I do this already in other areas of the application this is a crazy beast of a project and our usability tests have shown that the users are at least capable of recognizing that when the cursor changes to help that they can hover over the element and get some information about what is going on.p  pBut this is the first time Ive ever tried this with a form element. Apparently when I put disableddisabled in the element, it completely ignores the title attribute and will never display the tool tip.p  pNow, I know I have a few options at least the ones I could think ofp  ol liWrite my own custom tool tip plugin that is a little bit more robust.li liDont disable the element, but style it as disabled. This was the option I was leaning on the most in terms of ease to develop but I hate having to do this.li liLeave the button as enabled but dont process the click event. I dont like this option as much because I like to leave things natively styled as they should logically be. A disabled button feels the most correct and the look of a disabled button is instantly recognizable as a disabled button.li ol  pSo, with all that said, am I missing something Is there something easy that I can do that I just havent thought of Google searches have failed me on this topic, so I thought Id toss this out on StackOverflow to get some fresh eyes on this.p  pstrongEditstrong p  pI just found another StackOverflow question on this same topic, though that person used a very different set of terms describing his problem probably why I didnt find it.p  pThe url to the question is a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions2034820firefoxdoesnotshowtooltipsondisabledinputfieldshttpstackoverflow.comquestions2034820firefoxdoesnotshowtooltipsondisabledinputfieldsap  pBoth of the answers on that question are pretty good, though Id like to see if anyone has any other suggestions. Maybe something more jQuery specific Thanks again.p

Negative 7027 pIm maintaining a perl script which runs an automated install of our base server software.  One of the new requirements is to install the InlineJava module.p  pOur usual strategy of installing using Yum seems to fall down as theres no InlineJava available in yum.

Negative 7027 pIve an application that makes use of parallelization for processing data.p  pThe main program is in C, while one of the routine for analyzing data is on an external C dll. This library scans data and calls a callback everytime a certain signal is found within the data. Data should be collected, sorted and then stored into HD.p  pHere is my first simple implementation of the method invoked by the callback and of the method for sorting and storing datap  precode collection where saving found signals ListltMySignalgt mySignalList  new ListltMySignalgt   method invoked by the callback private void Collectint type, long time      locklocker  mySignalList.Addnew MySignaltype, time     store signals to disk private void Store       sort the signals     mySignalList.Sort      file is a object that manages the writing of data to a FileStream     file.WritemySignalList.ToArray  codepre  pData is made up of a bidimensional array short[][] data of size 10000 x n, with n variable.

Im facing a bottleneck and given that my CPU resources are not overutilized, I suppose that  the lock together with thousand of callbacks is the problem am I right or there could be something else. Ive tried the ConcurrentBag collection but performances are still worse in line with other user a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions4785622whyisconcurrentbagtsoslowinnet40amidoingitwrongfindingsa.p  pI thought that a possible solution for use lockfree code would be to have multiple collections. Then it would be necessary a strategy to make each thread of the parallel process working on a single collection. Collections could be for instance inside a dictionary with thread ID as key, but I do not know any .NET facility for this I should know the threads ID for initialize the dictionary before launching the parallelization. Could be this idea feasible and, in case yes, does exist some .NET tool for this Or alternatively, any other idea to speed up the processp  p[EDIT] Ive followed the Reed Copseys suggestion and I used the following solution according to the profiler of VS2010, before the burden for locking and adding to the list was taking 15 of the resources, while now only 1p  precode master collection where saving found signals ListltMySignalgt mySignalList  new ListltMySignalgt  threadlocal storage of data each thread is working on its ListltMySignalgt ThreadLocalltListltMySignalgtgt threadLocal   analyze data private void AnalizeData      usingthreadLocal  new ThreadLocalltListltMySignalgtgt gt           return new ListltMySignalgt               Parallel.Forltintgt0, 10000,          gt          return 0,         i, loopState, localState gt                       wrapper for the external c dll             ProcessDatadata[i]             return 0         ,         localState gt                      lockthis                               add threadlocal lists to the master collection                 mySignalList.AddRangelocal.Value                 local.Value.Clear                               method invoked by the callback private void Collectint type, long time      local.Value.Addnew MySignaltype, time  codepre

Negative 7027 pIt is recommended and sometimes necessary, classes that represent values  emvalue classesem to override codehashCodecode, codeequalscode [and optionally codetoStringcode] methods. The values that these methods return depend on all or subset of the member variables of the class and its superclass. To implement them properly you have to know a little bit of theory about emhashingem and a little bit of algebra and set theory not too much, and almost everything is explaind in the emjavadocsem for these methods and in Effective Java form Josh Bloch.br In most of the cases, the implementation of this methods follow a template, and IDEs like Eclipse JDT include tools to generate them. However, the tool generators, can not make any assumptions, and generate these methods using only constructs available in the language and the standard library. Because of that these methods usually look very ugly.p  pAnother way to implement these methods is to use library like Apaches  commonslang codeHashCodeBuildercode, codeEqualsBuildercode and codeToStringBuildercode. Using these utilities, one can implement their own codehashCodecode and codeequalscode methods that look much better.p  pMy question is about combining these two approaches. I would like to be able to customize Eclipses codehashCodecode and codeequalscode generators, so that will generate them using codeHashCodeBuildercode and friends. Is it possible and how to do this without tweaking the JDT Only writing small plugin that will override the default implementations but without changing JDT code.p  pThanks.p

Negative 7027 pI am trying to learn OpenGL ES 2.0 on Android.  I run through a few books and web tutorials on the subject.

Negative 7027 pDuring the years, I grown quite the affection for the ModelViewController design pattern and the benefits it provides. But Im struggling to make full use of these benefits when it comes to web applications.p  pIf I was to create a component called UsersComponent, which consists ofp  ul lia list of usersli lia text field which actively filters this list of usersli ul  pThen in Java Swing, You could easily do a class UserComponent which extended JPanel, and inside UserComponent, have you model, view and control classes. And youll end up with a very easily reuable component.p  pNow, what I would love to do, is to mimic this in JavaEE. String templates seems to provide a solution for this. BUT, with a added twist. I like web designers. And I would love to provide them with a opportunity of adding components without having to involve a developer or putting to much though into what entry point they should use.p  pFor example, lets say we have a base page template, and the designer wishes to add the UserComponent component somewhere on this page. You will then need to populate the model, in most cases based on some request parameters.p  pSo, heres the actual question. Does anybody know of a way, of determining which templates are included in a given template. So you could analyse this template at runtime or rather every time its modified, and do the appropriate housekeeping in the main page controllerp  pBasically, so I could accomplish thisp  ul liDesigner creates a stringtemplate. Say, MyPage.stli liRewrite module changes www.mydomain.comIgnoredFolderNameForSeoMyPage into www.mydomain.compagerenderservlettemplateNameMyPageli lithe page rendering servlet loads the stringtemplate based on the parameter, analyses it to determining which components are used within the string template and initializes them as needed.li ul  pCurrently, the best solution I have been able to come up with is to have different servlets for different base pages, which exposes different subsets of functionality. But Im not at all happy with this solution. It would be so much neater, if there was a possibility of handling it dynamically. Basically, having handlers for ALL supported components but only initializinghandling the ones which are actually needed.p  pI would love to hear your guys thoughts on this p  p UPDATE p  pI think my mentions of swing have confused this matter a little bit. What I would love to do is to create components, available to web strongdesignersstrong though string templates, which they can then include in any given string template.p  pSo i suppose it all comes down to this.p  pDoes any body know a string template framework, which lets me determine at run time, which other string templates are included in a string template.p

The usability part is that you may have visible the div with the Address you are about to add but what happens with that div if you try to add a new one Should be hidden If so, there should be a way to get them back just in case you need to change some data or if you dont hide them, you may end with a really big scroll bar.p  pAnd then, there is the way I save the info for each address div, Ill paste my code herep  precode.formdirecciones.eachfunction     var ajData  this.serialize     var idDireccion  this.attrid     if idDireccion  formnuevadireccion         ajData  ajData  ampactioninsertar                 ampcodclientecodcliente          else         idDireccion  idDireccion.split         ajData  ajData  ampcoddiridDireccion[2]              ampaction  action              ampcodcliente  codcliente           .ajax         type POST,         url controllersdireccion.php,         async false,         data ajData,         dataType html,         cache false       codepre  pAs you may see, it checks if the ID of the div is the one I use for that but even with that solutions it seems a little bit dirty to me.p  pAlso, it comes the problem where Im having repeated IDs...p

Negative 7027 pHopefully I can get my point across.p  pI am just trying to figure out the best way to let users of the site create forms as they wish.p  pThe good thing is that the form will always have the same fields and the only thing that needs to change are the event name that the form is being used for but that can easily just be stored in the database.p  pThe thing I am confused about is how to have a section in an admin area that the user fills out the name and sets the form to be visible and the form is then shown on the homepage.p  pI am racking my brains as to where the form template will be held since the only solution I can think of at the moment is to just store the entire html form data as a blob in the database along with the event name and its visibility status but I still dont know where the original form data will be that will insert into the database each time a form is created.p  pHopefully that makes some sense, any guidance would be appreciated.p  pI have just had one idea to store the form data in an external php file and include it in the page if any forms are set to visible but Id still like to know how others would approach this.p

Although the documentation of the StoreGeneratedPattern enum at MSDN and several explanations in blogs suggests, that StoreGeneratedPattern.Identity should be set to retrieve the generated value, when the DB generates a value on inserting a new row, this is not true for primary keys in conjunction with database triggers.p  pAfter thinking about that a long time, that seems perfectly logical to me, since the EF needs some criterium to retrieve databasegenerated values, and i think that would be in most cases the identity of an entity. For databasecolumns that are set to autoincrement or identitycolumn, ... that might be no problem, because the DBMS provides some functionality to retrieve the last inserted identityvalue e.g. identity in MSSQL. But when using a trigger to generate a new identityvalue, the EF obviously doesnt know how to query the newly inserted row and i cant imagine any good dbindependent way to do this either.p  pSo my actual question is are the assumptions above correct or am I overlooking something important herep  pThanks in advance for any clarificationinspiration on this.p  pstrongEdit followup questionstrongp  pAfter reading the answer from Ladislav another question arisesp  pIf I set StoreGeneratedPattern in CSDL, do I have to set it to the same value in SSDL and vice versa The patch for the edm designer implies that this is the case, because it automatically synchronizes the StoreGeneratedPattern in SSDL when you change it in CSDL through the designer.p

Negative 7027 pI am building an application on the Kohana framework. For content management, I will be using the Joomla framework, so our copywriters can easily add and edit content in a to them familiar UI.p  pI have defined several categories to which an article can belong to. E.g. blog codecatid  1code and product codecatid  2code. With the codexreferencecode column in the joomla content table, the user must assign the article to a specific id in the category selected because codeModelBlogcode can contain codeid  1code, as well as codeModelProductcode can.p  pSo every article in Joomla consists of a unique combination of codecatidcode and codexreferencecode.

Negative 7027 pI have just created my first git repository for some software my company writes. My intention is to be able to work on the software on multiple computers office computer, home computer and laptop for when Im working away.p  pThe problem I am having is that my software is an extension for another piece of software and my code files are mixed in with the code files of the software we write for. As a result, I am unable to just add a directory to the repo that can then be pulled to each machine. To remedy this, I added each directoryfile separately to the repo and then committed that. This worked great and my repo is working fine. The only problem is that when I pull the repo to another machine, instead of grabbing the files and adding them into the directory structure, it downloads all files and puts them inside a directory named after the repo. Is there anyway I can stop this so that the files are added to the existing directory structurep

Negative 7027 pI was at an interview last week and one of the questions in the programming test was How can you ensure that different constructors in a class have the same behaviour in Java.

Negative 7027 pOk, so heres the story. Weve got git repository with 2030k lines of code. My workmate copied copied, not moved few files in repo to create another module. Content of these files was just slightly modified. Then he made a commit. Meanwhile I worked with some of the files that he copied the originals and commited my work. When I was pulling I realized that Ive got conflicts in files that I didnt have, since he just created them copied them. After resolving the conflicts I checked my local repo and I dont have half of the files I suppose to have. I know git tracks the content of the files, not the file names, but right now its not very helpful.p  precodegit log remoterepo stat difffilterD codepre  pshows that few files was deleted, andp  precodegit log remoterepo stat C difffilterD codepre  pshows that fewer files was deleted but still somep  pWe need both copies of files so what should we dop
Negative 7027 pI created a .aspx web page for SharePoint 2010 that uses JQuery to extract list item data from a SharePoint list and then uses that data to populate a a hrefhttpcode.google.compsimilewidgetswikiTimeline relnofollowSimile Timelinea. p  pThe page includes a filter, which I believe uses some form of AJAX, updatesfilters what events display on the timeline based on what is entered in a text box see example a hrefhttpsimilewidgets.googlecode.comsvntimelinetagslatestsrcwebappexamplesjfkjfk.html relnofollowherea. For some reason, when I implement all of this on SharePoint by simply placing the .aspx file and other necessary files in a SharePoint library, everything works except the filter. When I check the console log using Firebug, the error given is that p  blockquote   ponKeyPress is not a function. p blockquote  pcodeonKeyPresscode is one of the functions involved in implementing the filter, but I have no idea why the browser is not seeing this function plenty of other functions from the same .js file including the function that calls onKeyPress to begin with run just fine. To make matters even more strange, if I put a break point right before the function runs and then allow it to continue after stopping, everything works fine. p  pThis lead me to believe that it may be a timing related issue, but Ive been tinkering around with codewindow.onload, document.readycode, and a SharePoint specific function called codespBodyOnLoadFunctionNamecode for about a day and seen no impact on the codes behavior. p  pThe files that seem to be most relevant to the situation are listdetails.aspx belowp  precodelt Page LanguageC MasterPageFilemasterurldefault.master inheritsMicrosoft.SharePoint.WebPartPages.WebPartPage, Microsoft.SharePoint, Version14.0.0.0, Cultureneutral, PublicKeyToken71e9bce111e9429c metaprogidSharePoint.WebPartPage.Document gt  ltaspContent runatserver ContentPlaceHolderIDPlaceHolderAdditionalPageHeadgt      ltscriptgt         Timelineajaxurltimelinetimelineajaxsimileajaxapi.js         TimelineurlPrefixtimelinetimelinejs         Timelineparametersbundletrue     ltscriptgt      ltscript srctimelinetimelinejstimelineapi.js typetextjavascriptgtltscriptgt      ltscript srcexamples.js typetextjavascriptgtltscriptgt     ltscriptgt    ltscript typetextjavascript srcjquery1.3.2.min.jsgtltscriptgt     ltscript srctline.js typetextjavascriptgtltscriptgt     ltscript typetextjavascriptgt          document.readyfunction               Build the URL of the Lists.asmx web service.

Negative 7027 pOur application uses multiple ways for authorizing access to a given resource. Although its working, its messy and... well, it doesnt seem right.p  h31 Rolebased authorizationh3  pWe have well defined roles where each role has access to a set of the resources and different roles can access the same resources.p  pResources, as of now, are simply MVC actions mapped in a database table as codemodulecode, codecontrollercode and codeactioncode.p  pThis seems to be OK, but every time I need to add a new controlleraction I have to map this resource to the database table.p  h32 Userbased authorizationh3  pBesides rolebased authorization, users can have more or less access to a subset of resources of another role. strongEg.strongp  pstrongRoleAstrong resources emaem, embem, emcem, emdembr strongRoleBstrong resources emxem, emyem, emzembr strongRoleCstrong resources em1em, em2em, em3embr strongUser1strong has strongRoleAstrong but needs to access resource emyembr strongUser2strong has strongRoleBstrong and strongRoleCstrong but does not have access to resource emzemp  pThis is implemented as an codeuserresourcescode table with entries for additional resources that the user has access or is denied indicated by a flag.p  pI could create different roles with tailored access, treating roles as group of permissions, but that would lead to a roles explosion.p  h33 Model state authorizationh3  pIf thats not enough, some actions can only be performed when the model is in a certain state each model knows when something can be done. strongEg.strong an order can only be edited if the user has access to the emeditem resource through steps 1 or 2 and the object codeOrdercode can be edited.p  pstrongAnoter examplestrong an user can access a codeCustomercode if he has access to codecustomerviewcode resource and he emownsem that Customer he is the contact info for that customer.p  h34 Display information in UIh3  pA role, group of roles or individual users can see more or less information about a model, depending on its state.p  pHow can I simplify this authorization process without loosing flexibility in giving or restraining access to resourcesp  pThere is any pattern Im missing here to unify all this authorization in a single placep

If I omit asmlinkage when defining a c function, does it imply cdecl or fastcallp  p3 if the default calling convention is cdecl, why is asmlinkage needed, considering cdecl is equal to asmlinkage modifier am I correct herep  p4 why are those system call functions all declared with asmlinkage. Can we copy the parameters to registers first, then call those system call functions From my point of view, in x86, when issuing a system call, the parameters are readily saved in registers then why bother to save then in stack to enforce such passing parameters via stack conventionp  pFinally, can anybody recommend some resourcesbooks that I can refer to for such mix assemblyc programming p

Negative 7027 pI have to give a demo on a machine which contains an old version of the C boost library.

Negative 7027 pSo, heres an example. I have a library in the package codeHTTPcode. I define subsections of the library in e.g. the package codeHTTP.TCPProtocolcode. Now I want to use TCPProtocol from the HTTP package, which means I have to make the TCPProtocol functionality public. At the same time, this functionality should not be exported to users of the library.p  pHow do I do this I dont want to shove my whole library into one package, as I feel the separate subpackages really make the code more structured and navigation easier in eclipse. But browsing around, I couldnt find a method to expose functions within my project, but not export them outside my project.p  pEDIT In light of me being able to come up with a better example, Im updating the OP.p

Negative 7027 pWhen codedelegatecode keyword is used in C, the C compiler automatically generates a class derived from codeSystem.MulticastDelegatecode class.p  pThis compiler generated class contains 3 methods as well codeInvoke, BeginInvoke and EndInvokecode.p  pAll these three methods are marked codepublic virtual externcode but interestingly the class itself is marked codesealedcode.p  pVirtual methods defined in a sealed class not only strikes as counterintuitive but are actually illegal in C.p  pSo my question is, is there a specific reason for this or is it just one of those harmless things done keeping in mind some hypothetical future enhancementp  pEdit 1p  pCan the reason be to force use of callVirt IL opcode as opposed to call so that delegate object is always checked for null by the CLR before trying to execute any of the three methods Though I fail to see why a codedelegatecode should be a special case in this respect.p  pAlso isnt it a performance hit to force use of codecallvirtcode though it may be minusculep  pEdit 2p  pAdded CIL tag, as it turns out that the C way of defining delegates is in fact mandated by the CIL standard. Standard states that following is not full textp  blockquote   pDelegates shall have a base type of System.Delegate. Delegates shall   be declared strongsealedstrong, and the only members a delegate shall have are   either the first two or all four methods as specified here. These   methods shall be declared runtime and managed. They shall not have a   body, since that body shall be created automatically by the VES. Other   methods available on delegates are inherited from the class   System.Delegate in the Base Class Library. The delegate methods arep      ol   liThe instance constructorli   liThe Invoke method shall be strongvirtualstrongli   liThe BeginInvoke method, if present, shall be strongvirtualstrongli   liThe EndInvoke method shall be strongvirtualstrongli   ol blockquote  pSo this is definitely not a side effect of compiler process or is similar to other interesting compiler outputs.p  pIf standard emphasizes something, it must be for some good reason and rationale. p  pSo the question now is why does CIL standard for delegates emphasizes on sealed and virtual at the same timep  pDoes the catch lie herep  blockquote   pThey shall not have a body, since that body shall be created automatically by the VES.p blockquote  pAre they marked virtual so that the VESCLR generated body can be executed on invocation of these methodsp

Negative 7027 pThis is a follow up to a question that was asked yesterday.p  pI have a viewmodel, which shows a list of objectives.  Using jquery I can add a new objectives line to the screen the ID is set to 0 for any new objectives listed.  When I click on the Save button to Post the objective list back to the controller, the controller loops through the objective list, and checks the ID against the database.  If the ID is NOT found, it creates a new objective, adds this to the DB context, and saves te changes. It then retreives the ID, and returns the Viewmodel to the View.p  pThe problem is, although the ID in the model, is updated to the database ID  when the model is rendered in the View again, its ID is still 0.  So if I click Save again, it again, readds the new objective added previously to the database again.p  pMy controller is shown belowp  precode          POST ObjectiveEditmodel     [HttpPost]     public ActionResult EditObjectivesEdit model              if model.Objectives  null                       foreach var item in model.Objectives                               find the database row                 Objective objective  db.objectives.Finditem.ID                 if objective  null  if database row is found...                                      objective.objective  item.objective                     objective.score  item.score                     objective.possscore  item.possscore                     objective.comments  item.comments                     db.SaveChanges                                  else  database row not found, so create a new objective                                      Objective obj  new Objective                     obj.commentsitem.comments                     obj.objective  item.objective                     obj.possscore  item.possscore                     obj.score  item.score                     db.objectives.Addobj                     db.SaveChanges                      now get the newly created ID                      item.ID  obj.ID                                                  return Viewmodel      codepre  pMy ID is being set in the controllerp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comOBRhv.png altenter image description herep  pstrongEDIT Another example here, showing model.Objectivesa hrefhttpi.stack.imgur.comOBRhv.png relnofollow1a.ID being updatedstrongp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.com0YxVj.png altenter image description herep  pHowever when the view renders it, it reverts to 0p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comvujcL.png altenter image description herep  pThe Objectives list is determined as followsp  precodeusing System using System.Collections.Generic using System.Linq using System.Web  namespace MvcObjectives2.Models          public class ObjectivesEdit              public IEnumerableltObjectivegt Objectives  set get          public ObjectivesEdit                      if Objectives  null                 Objectives  new ListltObjectivegt                    codepre  pThe View hasp  precodemodel MvcObjectives2.Models.ObjectivesEdit  using Html.BeginForm    Html.EditorForxgtx.Objectives   ltbutton typesubmit classbtn btnprimarygtlti classiconok iconwhitegtltigt Saveltbuttongt   codepre  pand in my EditorTemplate objective.cshtmlp  precodemodel  MvcObjectives2.Models.Objective            ltdiv classobjecgt ltdivgt Html.TextBoxForx gt x.objective ltdivgt ltdivgt Html.TextBoxForx gt x.score ltdivgt ltdivgt Html.TextBoxForx gt x.possscore ltdivgt ltdivgt Html.TextBoxForx gt x.comments  Html.HiddenForx gt x.ID   This is the ID where it should now show the new ID from the database, but shows 0  ltdivgt ltdivgt codepre  pI suspect the issue is somewhere in my controller  but I would appreciate any advise on how to get my View to render the new ID of the added objective.p

Negative 7027 pemNote Its quite complicated to explain. Please bare with me on this one.emp  pHi everybody,p  pIm implementing an application where both instances of a class as well as the class itself have children placed inside a codeNSMutableArraycode. Its a pretty complicated application, but thanks to ObjectiveC, its a breeze classes are themselves objects and can have methods and variables with the help of static variables and such.p  pTo make it myself easy, I implemented accessorsetter method on both my instances using codecode and classes using codecode to fetch and manipulate the children without having direct access to the arrays. I like to have my objects as much as possible closed and the methods do some data validation.p  pI also implemented a fast enumeration eminstanceem method from the codeNSFastEnumerationcode protocol.

Negative 7027 pLike my title, I want to know how to create a prepared statement without using MySQLi or PDO. The main point is learning the process of creation and its security. I have nearly ZEROKNOWLEDGE in this. Tried googling the topic but it seems that my googling skills have failed me. Ive blindly learned that prepared statement is pretty secure from some websites but I do not see the actual point that it is secure. Can some of you clarify why it is That would be a big help. I have my own assumption that creating a prepared statement is simply creating a function that receive string and replace all special character with strreplace likep  precodeorgsql  SELECT  FROM mytable WHERE tableid preparedsql  replaceQueryStringorgsql, 10  function replaceQueryStringstr, replace       Do the replace where  will be replaced by replace here.     return str  codepre  pBut I wonder if that will raise the level of the security, it looks rather plain to me. p  pIf you dont want to waste time answering this just point me to where the resource is available.

Negative 7027 pWe have a Login enforcement app which only allows a user to be logged into a single session in our app. This is done in the postauthenticate request event handler. p  pIf the user needs to be logged out they have another session we dop  precodeFormsAuthentication.SignOut FormsAuthentication.RedirectToLoginPage codepre  pThis has worked fine for a long time.

Negative 7027 pI have a user control A that has another user control B as its child. The usecase scenario being, when the user clicks a button on A, it should emrequestem B to process some information typically relating to the state of B and get the result, which will then be used in some calculation in A.p  pNow, I am using MVVM pattern. The viewmodel of A does not have any reference to either the UI of A or B. I am exactly looking for this When a user cliks a button on the UI of A, I need to call a command in B, by passing a delegate in the viewmodel of A as a parameter to that command. This way, when the command in B processes information, it can emthenem call the callback function passed from A.p  pNow, the delegate is parameterless. Once the command in usercontrol B processes some information, it updates emits stateem. This state is a dependency property which will be binded to a property in the viewmodel of A.p  pIs there a way to achieve something like thisp  pI have a working solution currently. But I want to improvise the code and make it better. This is my current temporary workaround to this problemp  pWhen the user clicks a button in A, I am having an Event Handler in A xaml.cs. In the event handler, as I have the reference of B, I am checking if the command in B can be executed, and then call it. Then, I check if command in viewmodel of A can be executed, and then call it.p  pIf my question was not descriptive enough, here is a code sample to support itp  pstrongXAML of Astrongp  precodeltbNameSpaceB xNameBObject DepenPropertyInBBinding PropInA, ModeOneWayToSourcegt .... lttelerikRadButton ContentProcess HorizontalAlignmentRight Height30 Width80 Grid.Column2 ClickProcessButtonClick gt codepre  pstrongXAML.cs of Astrongp  precodeprivate void ProcessButtonClickobject sender, RoutedEventArgs e      if BObject.StateDataRequestedCommand.CanExecute         BObject.StateDataRequestedCommand.Execute      ifViewModel.ProcessInfoRequestedCommand.CanExecute         ViewModel.ProcessInfoRequestedCommand.Execute  codepre  pstrongViewModel of Astrongp  precodeprivate void OnProcessInfoRequestedCommandstring anyValue       read the value of PropInA and do some processing  codepre  pstrongViewModel of Bstrongp  precodeprivate void OnStateDataRequestedCommandstring anyValue       Bases on Bs state do some calc and update DepenPropertyInB  codepre

Negative 7027 pIm new to socket programming and programming a Java UDP simple clientserver application. Im writing a timedate server client.

Negative 7027 pThank you in advance for any help, this is coursework so further reading pointers is greatly appreciated. p  pI asked a question the other day relating to my own deletetrashrestore scripts and I have completed delete and trash as well as giving delete a backup text file for Restore to use later on.p  pHowever, instead of giving me errors, the Restore script just kinda stops in the console. Like when I type  Restore n     the cursor skips to the next line without the usual  and I have to close it manually. Likewise without the n option.

Negative 7027 pI have an application that issues notifications that when selected start an activity.

Although, I encounter weird occurrences.p  pIf I change the color of an entire row to yellow, then change it back to white specifically targeting one cell, so it sets the row color to white, and then targets a specific cells defaultcellstyle.backcolor to white, then change the color of the entire row to gray, the one cell that was originally set to white will not change.p  pWhy is this  Do the row colors not supersede the cell style colors The cell thats explicitly targeted can be either white or gray, so this is why it has to be targeted, i have only tested it in the situations where it is explicitly stated as white, however.p  pedit The code is below its loaded on formload.  The first time it runs through this its fine and works.  Depending on if I trigger a click event within the contained datagridview, the second time it runs through it may not color the forecolor to tomato.  Everytime I step through the code, it always hits the cell formatting.  Im unsure as to why after the datagridview click, the next iteration of filterrows will hit the cell formatting, but will NOT be reflected in the datagridview.  After filterrows, the formDGV are displayed.p  precode        Public Sub filterrows     Dim intCount As Integer  0      PROCESS THROUGH LCCRETAINED FOR ACCOUNTING MESSAGES AND TEMP CARDS     For Each row As chgltrDataSet.BCLCCSelectDataRow In frmFinBatchChrg.ChgltrDataSet.BCLCCSelectData         If row.ItemLCCRETAINED.ToString  X Then             gridccselector.RowsintCount.Cells0.Style.ForeColor  Color.Tomato             row.ItemLCCCARDTYPE               row.ItemLCCCCEXP               row.ItemLCCNAMEONCARD           ElseIf row.ItemLCCRETAINED.ToString  0 Then             gridccselector.RowsintCount.Cells0.Style.ForeColor  Color.Yellow         End If         intCount  1     Next End Sub codepre

Negative 7027 pI would love to find out what the best way to go about writing Python scripts on a Mac would be. Ive gone through two ways mind you, Im trying to avoid using vim because I want an IDE rather bland text editor. I went through using PyDev in Eclipse the more I went through their recommendations and steps, the more of a hassle everything seemed to be.. although I do have everything set up and it can compile.. I want to know if theres a better way. Im not too fond of Eclipse as is and I tried to set up Xcode through the following steps a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions5276967pythoninxcode4Xcode4a to run Python scripts. The problem with the Xcode version, is I would have to consistently setup the project like this every time. That, and every time I compiled something that needed to create a file it didnt say using the command conn  sqlite3.connectlist.sqlite3. Is there a simple way to do this Ive been trying to follow various iOS tutorials that want me to use python scripts which Im not familiar with at all such as a hrefhttpwww.raywenderlich.com902sqlite101foriphonedeveloperscreatingandscripting relnofollowraywenderlich.coma and Oreilly tutorials.

Negative 7027 pI have an iPad app that Ive inherited the code for.p  pIm relatively new to iPad development, so please bear with me...p  pThe app was compiled offsite by a contractor in 2010. Since then, my company has been acquired and were in the process of rebranding. My seemingly simple task is to replace our logo in this app with a new logo. It should take a few minutes  just drop a new logo into the code, compile, and bam Done.p  pTheres a problem with compiling the code...the working app launches in landscape mode and fills the entire screen with its interface. When I compile the app in the simulator or run it on my iPad connected to my mac via USB cable, the screen launches in landscape mode, but the view is in portrait mode. In intermittent places throughout the app, the views switch from landscape to portrait layout.p  pThis is driving me nuts because I dont even know what to look for. I see some references to shouldAutoRotateToInterfaceOrientation  I think thats been deprecated. Could that be causing the problemp  pI know a LOT has changed since 2010. Im currently running the latest version of XCode on a new mac. From what I understand, my predecessor never actually compiled the app here, but relied totally on the contractor...from what I can see, this may be a problem thats been there all along, but nobody was aware ofp  pstrongUPDATEstrongp  pI have an older mac with an older version of XCode to test with. Ive moved the app code onto the older mac, changed a few settings, and it works correctly.p  pIve also noticed the layout isnt quite correct on ANY app I create on my new mac. For example, dropping a button near the top of the form winds up scrolled off the top of the app, so its not even visible.p  pIs there a setting in XCode that defines this behaviorp
Negative 7027 pWe use JBoss 5.1 to deploy all of our services. But we have run into this problem.p  pLets say we have 2 projects A and B. Both A and B has its own separate log file to log stuff into A.log and B.log. Both of these projects use a common dependency C. Now, if project A calls C and there is a logger statement in C, it needs to be logged to A.log as C was called from A. Similarly, if Project B calls C, the logger statement in C should be logged to B.log.p  pHow do we configure JBoss and log4j to achieve this logging p  pAdvance Thanks.p

Negative 7027 pIn linqtoentities queries, how spaces be prepended to shorterlength values when querying against an nvarchar columnp  pI seek this capability to facilitate proper sorting of certain fields.p  pstrongHere is my scenariostrong p  pI have database that contains empart numberem columns in virtually every table.  These part number columns are represented as nvarchar20 in the database.  They usually contain a combination of both 6digit and 8digit part numbers.  The vast majority of these part numbers are in fact numeric but some are nonnumeric. Consequently they are represented as strings rather than integers.p  pBecause these part numbers are represented as strings rather than numbers, they do no sort properly.  The 6digit and 8digit values are intermingled rather than separately grouped.  So I want to pad the shorter length values with leading spaces to solve the sorting problem.p  pI do realize that if these columns were stored as emncharem rather than emnvarcharem, I would get this padding automatically.  But changing the data type for these columns is not an option at this point.p  pWhen I craft my own linq queries, I can do sorting properlyp  precodedb.table.Select gt .partNumberColumn.OrderBy gt .Length.ThenBy gt  codepre  pThe problem arises when other tools such as grid automatically compose queries.

Negative 7027 pI am using the mandrillapi from MailChimp to send an email to many people in a single API call.

The rest of my app uses Rails action mailer so email content is handled cleanly in the view layer.p  pIf you could tell me how to use simpleformat somehow that would be a quick fix to achieve the formatting I need on self.body. Im open to more elegant solutions to make this function more like Rails mailer though. One option Ive considered is using a controller method to return the email html but then I think that would result in a selfreferencing http request which wouldnt be an efficient way to go about it.

Negative 7027 pIm currently trying to find the best message queue solution for an appharbor application. Most of the ones of looked at assume you have a windows environment with MSMQ and DTC installed, which I dont believe the appharbor environment provides.p  pI would like something that works well with ravendb, as that is the database we are using. Something whos only dependence is on raven would be ideal, especially if it integrates with our existing unit of work. Ie, when save changes is called in our controller action the messages are saved in the same transaction.p  pIt would also need a host that works in a console application for background processing.p  pIdeally I would like something that just works in a development environment also. With raven, for example, we use the embedded mode while developing and I would like something that doesnt require installation.p  pIve looked at nServicebus, which seems to fail these conditions because it needs a transport msmq, sql, etc and much of the documentation is out of date.p  pI also looked at rhino service bus but there is a distinct lack of documentation and community.

The boxes will come in shapes of 20x20 and 40x40. So lets say If I want to fit the highest number of boxes and rectangles in this bigger rectangle in order to leave no space. How I can achieve it other that bin packing algorithm or rectangle packing algorithm. And if I should pick one of those algorithms, is there a good implementation out there for this scenario p

Negative 7027 pI have implemented a custom version of a search form that behaves a lot like a UISearchBar with a scope bar but is actually pieced together programatically for UI reasons. The screen loads with a TextField, you tap in the TextField and the navigation bar animates up off the screen, the text field moves up and a segmented control appears for filtering results. p  pAnyway, that all works, but when I tap on one of the search results my code pushes a new ViewController. The problem is that new controller gets pushed without a navigation bar because I used code[[self navigationController] setNavigationBarHiddenYES animatedYES]code when switching to the search state. p  pI can show the navigation bar as the new ViewController gets pushed, or even animate it in as the transition to the new ViewController appears  but all those solutions look clunky. I want it to work as if you were using a UISearchBar actually more like the email app in that the restored navigation bar appears to just slide in from the right as if its part of the child view controller.p  pIm hoping therell be a simple fix... thanksp

Negative 7027 pIm looking for a good way say, to save favorite images for a specific user in the database. Or if I have a movie, I want to display related movies, you get the idea. I dont know how to do it on a database level codephpmyadmincode. My idea so far is if I have a table named codeUserscode, I add a column in it named codeFavoritescode, in which I enter every ID or Name of the favorite item. The problem is that the content in this column may grow a lot more than I expect, and I dont feel this is a good way to do it. So how do I go about thisp

Negative 7027 pIm trying to understand the best use of Services in Android for database queries newbie. The service should enable a connection via internet to a database that is used to query a database from an activity.p  pMy understanding is that this can be achieved using a Bound Service, i.e., multiple clients can be bound to the service each of which has access to the services methods. However, Im unsure as to whether to extend the codeServicecode class or its subclass codeIntentServicecode for this situation.p  pIdeally the service should connect to the database once at the start of the service, e.g. in its codeonCreatecode method, and disconnect in the services codeonDestroycode method. The service will then have various methods that use this connection to query the database.p  pSo, is there a difference between extending the codeServicecode class and starting a new thread in codeonCreatecode for the database connection, and extending the codeIntentServicecode class and starting the connection in codeonCreatecode i.e. codeIntentServicecode initiates its own worker threadp  pWhen you bind to an codeIntentServicecode is it kept alive until all activities have unbound from itp  pIs this the best way to do itp  pThanksp

Negative 7027 pThis is for a beginners C programming unit.

Or they enter black and every itemid with black in colors is listed. or they enter Adult Blue and emeveryem item with either Adult emorem Blue would come up. Im sure you get the idea.p  pIve read up on multiple methods, but I cant figure out which is bestp  pUsing a strongMANY TO ONEstrong table This seems like it would work, but there are over 500 unique items, so that would be thousands and thousands of rows. For itemid 1 I would have to make a row for Adult, a row for Denim, a row for Pants, a row for black, a row for red, a row for blue. I might as well just hard code everything. p  pUsing codeFINDINSETcode Is this going to work Would I have to store the values with commas like codeAdult,Denim,Pantscode and also codeEXPLODEcode to separate the values I was going to try this method but I keep reading that storing multiple values in a field is very bad practice.p  pOr are strongRegular Expressionsstrong what Im looking forp  pWhat is the best way to store the values, and what is the best way to retrieve them Im not asking for exact code, just the methods to use. Any advice is appreciatedp

Negative 7027 pAs I am interested in photography, I thought that it would be nice to have a timelapse capable camera app for Firefox OS. I started to do a bit of research, but all I found was that I need a certified app to use the camera without user interaction. via the Camera APIp  pAt this point I started to look for a way to enable custom certified apps by somehow even tricking the OS or I dont know. When I couldnt find any way I could do this on an actual phone some people were able to achieve this in some specific simulator versions, but that makes no sense in the case of a camera based app I even started to think about modifying the built in camera application, but I think it would require recompiling the whole OS.p  pI downloaded the GAIA source from github, and tried to install a slightly modified version of the camera app to the phone, but although it started up, there was a blank space in the place off the live view and it did not work at all.p  pI would really appreciate any working methods to achieve this, or even some ideas on what I could try.p  pI would also welcome any guides telling me how could I do this with GAIA.p  pThanks in advancep

Negative 7027 pCurrently, I am using Amazon EC2 C1medium server to run my service. I heard that Amazon EC2 server made a new type server called, Amazon EC2 C3. Amazon EC2 C3 offers SSD hard disk. p  pI was wondering I can change Instance Type without moving my old data files, and I believe that they can do it because they are using normal hard disk. However, I found out that I can change the instance type even though I want to change my old server to SSD hard disk. p  pI didnt change the type yet because I worry about losing server data. I read documents but couldnt find the answer. How does it work and is it safe to do itp

Negative 7027 ul listrongContextstrongli ul  pI have a handwritten job server think a very limited equivalent of something like Gearman that uses AMQP and RabbitMQ as its messaging broker. I use Rabbit 3 and can upgrade as necessary. I run many instances of this server, most of which consume from the same work queue. p  pThere is a large class of work that the server needs to do that absolutely cant be repeated.  Theres also an idempotent i.e. messages can be rerun if need be mode of execution that acks only after successful execution, but there are no issues with that part. p  pIn nonrepeatable mode message processing on a client looks like this assuming that its consuming the appropriate queuep  ol liReceive a messsage.li liUnpackparseverify the message contents.li liAck the message.li liDo the operation requested by the message.li liGOTO step 1.li ol  pThe requirement that work be nonrepeatable is so important that the inherent risks of the above scenario messages get dropped on the floor if a job server is killed between steps 3 and 4 are acceptable.p  ul listrongProblemstrongli ul  pSometimes, step 4 takes a very long time. Since the AMQP client has already acked its only message assuming a a hrefhttpwww.rabbitmq.comamqp091reference.htmlbasic.qos.prefetchsize relnofollowqosa of 1, RabbitMQ pushes it another if one exists, and that message then stays in codeunackedcode status until the job server finishes execution of its current message. This is very bad, because the work being done is very highpriority and should be done ASAP, and there are almost always available consumers who are not in the middle of doing work that can perform requested operations immediately.p  pHence, my questionp  pstrongWhile remaining a consumer on a queue, how do I guarantee that a message will only be processed once, without consumingunacking any other messages during the processing phasestrongp  ul listrongWhat Ive triedstrongli ul  pstrong1.strong The first thing Itried was setting the QoS sometimes called prefetch size, but thats a misnomer since theres no fetching involved, just server pushes to 1 or 0. Setting it to 1 reduces the severity of this problem, but doesnt solve it, since one message can still be made to wait for a previous messages processing to finish. Setting QoS to 0 unlimits the local buffer size, which makes the problem much worse.p  pstrong2.strong I played with breaking up work queues to be separate per job server instance, but that damages scalability, since I have to add objects to the broker every time I need a new instance. I need to be able to increase the amount of work that could be done in parallel just by starting new instances of the server, no messaging topology changes required.p  pstrong3.strong The naive solution of writing a record to some central state every time a message starts running i.e. reimplementing message locking is far too slow.p  pstrong4.strong I tried cancelling the consume immediately after acking the message, nacking everything in the local buffer, and reestablishing the consume for the next message. This was very slow on the clients, generated a whole lot more network traffic, and worst of all, made the Rabbit server experience very high load and progressively slower performance. The management APIUI also became sluggish and difficult to use, my federation exchanges began hanging, and HA started falling out of sync.p  pstrong5.strong I thought about a complicated topological solution First, Id ensure that all messages had a routing key of a unique identifier I could use headers exchanges and the codemessageidcode AMQP field later, but this is a simpler implementation. All messages would be published to a topic exchange codexAcode, whose alternate exchange is codexBcode. codexBcode would be a direct exchange, and bind directly to codeqCcode, the work queue. Id also create codeqDcode, which would only contain work that failed to process or was rejected due to a crash on a job server instance. Then, I could start a specialized daemonconstantlyrunning program somewhere that loops through the entire contents of codeqCcode, acks them all, and manually republishes each one to codexAcode. All messages enter the system through codexAcode anyway, and in the default state they end up in codeqCcode regardless of their routing keys.p  pThe message lifecycle on each client would then look likep  ol liReceive a messsage.li liUnpackparseverify the message contents.li liIf a message has the a hrefhttpwww.rabbitmq.comreliability.htmlconsumer relnofollowredelivered bita set ul liAck the message.li liRepublish it asis to codexAcode.li liWait for confirmation.li liRemove binding from codexAcode to codeqDcode with the routing key of the message received a UID.li ulli liElse ul liAdd binding from codexAcode to codeqDcode with the routing key of the message received a UID.li liDo the operation requested by the message.li liAck message.li liGOTO 1.li ulli ol  pThat way, if a message failed during its do work phase and was implicitly rejected with coderequeue1code, the coderedeliveredcode bit would be set. The next job server instance to receive that redelivered message would ack it and republish it to codexAcode, which would route it to codeqDcode. After the publish was confirmed the message landed in codeqDcode, the binding would be eliminated. p  pThat solution would solve the problem better than any of the other theories Ive had. However, I think that the huge number of bindings that could potentially be created and the addremove binding requestssecond rate would very probably severely impact Rabbits performance. a hrefhttplists.rabbitmq.compipermailrabbitmqdiscuss2010June007618.html relnofollowThis discussion threada seems to corroborate that theory. Ideally, Id like a solution that doesnt send more network traffic to and from the rabbit server than it absolutely needs to, and doesnt create more persistent objects temp messages, queues, bindings, etc on the server than it absolutely needs to.p

Negative 7027 pI have been working on maven for some time but never had this question before, Many times I created my maven project using a IDE wizard which helps me to create a maven project which has pom.xml preconfigured or the other way is to convert a general java project into maven project which generates a pom.xml. I have a question what exactly happens in the background when we convert this java project into a maven project. What will be configured and how does the java project detects it has a pom.xml.p
Negative 7027 pIm currently developing a clientserverbased game using C remoting. Everything seemed to work fine until I tried to set up the codeTcpServerChannelcode.

In the first call the return value of the codeDns.GetHostNamecode method which correctly returns my computer name, lets say we got hostname here is passed as argument while in the second call the returned codeIPHostEntry.HostNamecode is passed. Here is where the problem occurs Since my computer is inside a domain lets call it domain, the returned codeIPHostEntry.HostNamecode contains hostname.domain instead of just hostname. The second codeDns.GetHostEntryhostname.domaincode call then throws an exception because hostname.domain is not known.p  pThere is a a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions3263257systemruntimeremotingchannelscorechannelgetmachineipfromnetreflectorsimilar questiona, but it didnt help me in any way.p  pI dont know why this thing is working that way, but I cant change my computer name or the domain, so I am stuck at this point and really need some help.p  pI am using Windows 7 64bit if it matters, VS Professional 2012 Update 4 and .NET Framework 4.5.p  pThanks for the helpp

Negative 7027 pstrongDomain Driven Design Passing Events to separate Bounded Contextsstrongp  hr  pA user action in MVC should generate an Event which is passed to a remote same LAN Event handler.p  pWhat Ive testedp  ol liMVC fire and forget service call asynchronous   li liIIS hosted WCF which gathers data and populates a message   li liSent via EasyNetQRabbitMQ ServiceBus   li liThe event is consumed by a Subscriber using a DI container initialized from a WCF service endpoint which handles the event amp its data.li ol  pI did some testing to see how it works if the service is called fairly quickly by looping in the MVC sidep  precodefor int i  0 i lt 200 i          ...         client.MyServiceMethodsomeId, startDate          ...  codepre  pThe MessageQueue part is quick, based on the timestamps it is sent to the queue and received by the subscriber within the same second. Looping through the WCF service calls is very slow. It takes many seconds to loop through them. I tried switching from wsHttpBinding to netTcpBinding, and playing with the serviceThrottling in WCF.p  pWCF isnt compulsory, but it seems like a separate event handling project on the publisher end would be beneficial and could be physically located elsewhere from the MVC app load reduction etc.. Is WCF plausible for a situation like this, or should I try using Windows services or some other selfhosted e.g. console app etc, or potentially using a thread in MVC to generate the event data, or are there better scenarios What are the best practices in this type of Event handling system Basically it seems like it would be beneficial to have something generating the Event data since it has to be handled somewhere while not slowing down the UI that the end user is using.p

Negative 7027 pI am trying to implement a simple projective texture mapping approach by using shaders in OpenGL 3. While there are some examples on the web I am having trouble creating a working example with shaders.p  pI am actually planning on using two shaders, one which does a normal scene draw, and another for projective texture mapping. I have a function for drawing a scene  codevoid ProjTextureMappingScenerenderSceneGLFWwindow windowcode and I am using glUseProgram to switch between shaders. The normal drawing works fine. However, it is unclear to me how I am supposed to render the projective texture on top of an already textured cube. Do I somehow have to use a stencil buffer or a framebuffer objectthe rest of the scene should be unaffected p  pI also dont think that my projective texture mapping shaders are correct since the second time I render a cube it shows black. Further, I tried to debug by using colors and only the codetcode component of the shader seems to be nonzeroso the cube appears green. I am overriding the codetexColorcode in the fragment shader below just for debugging purposes.p  pstrongVertexShaderstrongp  precodeversion 330  uniform mat4 TexGenMat uniform mat4 InvViewMat  uniform mat4 P uniform mat4 MV uniform mat4 N  layout location  0 in vec3 inPosition layout location  1 in vec2 inCoord layout location  2 in vec3 inNormal  out vec3 vNormal, eyeVec out vec2 texCoord out vec4 projCoords  void main      vNormal  N  vec4inNormal, 0.0.xyz      vec4 posEye     MV  vec4inPosition, 1.0     vec4 posWorld   InvViewMat  posEye     projCoords      TexGenMat  posWorld       only needed for specular component      currently not used     eyeVec  posEye.xyz      glPosition  P  MV  vec4inPosition, 1.0  codepre  pstrongFragmentShaderstrongp  precodeversion 330  uniform sampler2D projMap uniform sampler2D gSampler uniform vec4 vColor  in vec3 vNormal, lightDir, eyeVec in vec2 texCoord in vec4 projCoords  out vec4 outputColor  struct DirectionalLight      vec3 vColor     vec3 vDirection     float fAmbientIntensity   uniform DirectionalLight sunLight  void main void       supress the reverse projection     if projCoords.q gt 0.0              vec2 finalCoords  projCoords.st  projCoords.q         vec4 vTexColor  texturegSampler, finalCoords          only t has nonzero values..why         vTexColor  vec4finalCoords.s, finalCoords.t, finalCoords.r, 1.0         vTexColor  vec4projCoords.s, projCoords.t, projCoords.r, 1.0         float fDiffuseIntensity  max0.0, dotnormalizevNormal, sunLight.vDirection         outputColor  vTexColorvColorvec4sunLight.vColor  sunLight.fAmbientIntensity  fDiffuseIntensity, 1.0       codepre  pstrongCreation of TexGen Matrixstrongp  precodebiasMatrix  glmmat40.5f, 0, 0, 0.5f,                   0, 0.5f, 0, 0.5f,                   0, 0, 0.5f, 0.5f,                   0, 0, 0, 1       43 perspective with 45 fov     projectorP  glmperspective45.0f  zoomFactor, 4.0f  3.0f, 0.1f, 1000.0f     projectorOrigin  glmvec33.0f, 3.0f, 0.0f     projectorTarget  glmvec30.0f, 0.0f, 0.0f     projectorV  glmlookAtprojectorOrigin,  projector origin                                     projectorTarget,      project on object at origin                                      glmvec30.0f, 1.0f, 0.0f    Y axis is up                                          mModel  glmmat41.0f ... texGenMatrix  biasMatrix  projectorP  projectorV  mModel invViewMatrix  glminversemModelmModelView codepre  pstrongRender Cube Againstrongp  pIt is also unclear to me what the modelview of the cube should be Should it use the view matrix from the slide projectoras it is now or the normal view projector Currently the cube is rendered blackor green if debugging in the middle of the scene view, as it would appear from the slide projectorI made a toggle hotkey so that I can see what the slide projector sees.

Negative 7027 pI am building a wall using infinite scroll, and the posts on the wall are ordered by the time of last comment.p  pLets say There are 2 users, A and B.  Initially the wall has 10 posts and the infinite scroll adds 10 more posts every time.p  pScenario A are viewing the initial 10 posts on the wall. Meanwhile, B have triggered the infinite scroll once, so he can view the next 10 posts as well. Then B decides to add a comment for the 11th post. After B added the comment, A triggered the infinite scroll. However A would not see the same 1120 posts as B saw. A would see 2 same posts the 10th and 11th. Because the former 11th post had a new comment and became the new latest post. p  pI am wondering is there any way to overcome this problem.p

Negative 7027 pBackground I have been asked to develop a database to replace an existing 2002 MS Access database for obvious reasons.  This company has been using this database since 2005 so it is extremely outdated and does not perform the necessary report generation or queries required for their current needs.  It also doesnt lend itself to very user friendly data entry or have all the necessary fields they desire.  p  pThe database is one gigantic table with about 130 fields. Every time even repeat customers use the business a new record is made.  The database has grown to well over 65,000 records in their current business dataset and over 100,000 records which have been purged.  They use about 20 different reports and I see about 40 different queries some no longer used.  I have limited database experience, however I have in the past developed several very functional MS Access databases with some pretty cool functionality and am familiar with VBA.  I truly dont have any experience with SQL, however I am confident enough to know with some tutorials, example code I can cut and paste, , and maybe a trip to Barnes and Nobles I can teach myself enough to accomplish the task.  I just know that MS Access doesnt quite foot the bill for their current needs speed, size, concurrent updates, multiple connections, etc..p  pI would like to automate this process as much as I can in order to provide some sort of product for use for them relatively quickly.  My question and idea is......if I can convert the old 2002 Access database to MS Sql Server Express, can I then convert the MS Sql Server Express database to the free open source MySql.  The cost of MS SQL Server with licensing could end up being rather hefty so I would like to possible leverage the free MySql.p  pThe database will be primarily used on the local network.  Some users remote desktop in currently to access the data Id like to get them on VPNs in the future.  End state, I would like to create an application tailored to their specific needs and more modern and functional, potentially accessible from the web they have a site and domain, and also potentially in the future a mobile application for easy access to the data.  Ive looked at  App Development solutions and have found IronSpeed which seems very cool any opinions My overall question is Is the scenario I described above possible  Will it support the future implementations I am looking to sourcecreate  Would it be too difficult to teach myself the basics needed to program MySql My background it IT, however not databases.  I think this could be a good first large project to learn with.p  pThank you for your time and reading. If anyone has any suggestionsalternate solutions it would be greatly appreciated.p

In my case the tasks will be delivered to the looper thread intermittently, there will be time gap between the tasks. The time gap is not fixed, it changes as per user interaction. I do not want the infinite loop of the looper class to run when there is not task, since this will consume resources. Is there a way such that the thread executes the task as and when it arrives without blocking the thread p

Negative 7027 pI need to reduce the size of my system path variable.  I have had several version of Delphi on this machine that have since been deleted.  Several versions remain, however.  I would like to delete the paths in the system path variable that are no longer needed.  I could guess, based on the sequence, but would feel more confident if I had a list of the version of Delphi, along with the path used.p  pDoes such a list existp  pThe reason for trimming of the system path variable is that many products Delphi included adds the path it needs to the system path, but when you uninstall, it seems that it is not deleted from the system path.  After installing XE6, and bringing up the XE version which I have to keep for an old project, informs me that it cannot add a path to the system path variable since, to do so, would make it too large.p

Negative 7027 pI have two different view controllers with a codeSKScenecode in the first one. There we find the game itself and in the second one the score with a Replay button. When the game finishes, I delete the scene and I codealloccodeand codeinitcode it again when the user clicks Replay. My problem is that if a certain codeSKSpriteNodecode was rotated when the game ended, after deleting it and reseting it, when I go back to that scene it remains rotated in the exact same angle as before deleting the scene. The codeinitWithSizecode is called properly, so Im not sure why is that happening. My question is if theres a way of resetting the codeSKScenecode so that its identical to the first time the game was played. Thanksp

I do know that codechar varcode is equal to codechar var[]code in function arguments. I wrote this code up really quickly without even testing it. I know it is definitely not the best code in the world and I wouldnt advice anybody to use it in real life.  Ideally I would allocate the struct dynamically and pass around a pointer, however, I am teaching a person to program in CC. It is for a national exam which doesnt require a person to know dynamic allocation or pointers for that matter, that is why codecode are not really used at all.p  pThe question is really about whether it is okay to return a struct holding a statically allocated array.p  pShall we use this piece of code insteadp  precodeinclude ltiostreamgt  struct t     char name[32]     int id   t fooint id     t myt     myt.id  id     forchar i  0 i lt 31 i         myt.name[i]  a          myt.name[31]  0     return myt   int main     t maint  foo0     stdcout ltlt maint.name is this safe to access      return 0  codepre

Negative 7027 pShould I use java.util.Date or java.sql.Datep  pI have a VisualFox database and I have retrieved the entities with the IntelliJ Idea wizard using an appropiate jdbc type 4 driver.p  pThe ide or the driver has created the date fields as Timestamp. However, the date fields are not timestamps but Date fields, they store year, month and day only.p  pSo I wonder if I should switch to java.util.Date or java.sql.Date.

Negative 7027 pIm digging an open source project Chromium which is written in c and I want to create a file and write to it. BTW, I build the source code using Ninja build system.

However, when I create a new project using VS2010 and copy .exe file of the project in the same directory of the Chromium, the code creates the file. So I think there is no problem with the directory permission.  p  pIn addition, I checked the task manager and found several Chrome.exe processes, so I thought maybe its because of concurrent processes. Then I decided to check this and added strongcinstrong command to the above code to the new project in VS2010, before closing the file and run concurrent processes .exe. In this way, I dont close the file and open several instances of it. Surprisingly, all programs successfully can open the file and write to it. p  pI do not know what to check more, I was wondering if anyone can help me with this.p  pstrongUPDATEstrong I found the problem and you can find the solution in the the answer part.p

Negative 7027 pI have have a Symfony2 based app it resides in webapp.php.p  pIn same project I have a different app  webappapi.php, which basically expose API to public.p  pI need to modify .htaccess file or Apache config so all requests to url api would use appapi.php and all others app.php. How can that be donep  pEdit.p  pCurrent .htaccess filep  precode Use the front controller as index file. It serves as a fallback solution when  every other rewriteredirect fails e.g. in an aliased environment without  modrewrite. Additionally, this reduces the matching process for the  start page path  because otherwise Apache will apply the rewriting rules  to each configured DirectoryIndex file e.g. index.php, index.html, index.pl. DirectoryIndex app.php  ltIfModule modrewrite.cgt RewriteEngine On   Determine the RewriteBase automatically and set it as environment variable.  If you are using Apache aliases to do mass virtual hosting or installed the  project in a subdirectory, the base path will be prepended to allow proper  resolution of the app.php file and to redirect to the correct URI. It will  work in environments without path prefix as well, providing a safe, onesize  fits all solution. But as you do not need it in this case, you can comment  the following 2 lines to eliminate the overhead. RewriteCond REQUESTURI1 ..2 RewriteRule .  [EBASE1]   Redirect to URI without front controller to prevent duplicate content  with and without app.php. Only do this redirect on the initial  rewrite by Apache and not on subsequent cycles. Otherwise we would get an  endless redirect loop request gt rewrite to front controller gt  redirect gt request gt ....  So in case you get a too many redirects error or you always get redirected  to the start page because your Apache does not expose the REDIRECTSTATUS  environment variable, you have 2 choices   disable this feature by commenting the following 2 lines or   use Apache gt 2.3.9 and replace all L flags by END flags and remove the    following RewriteCond best solution RewriteCond ENVREDIRECTSTATUS  RewriteRule app.php. ENVBASE2 [R301,L]   If the requested filename exists, simply serve it.  We only want to let Apache serve files and not directories. RewriteCond REQUESTFILENAME f RewriteRule .  [L]   Rewrite all other queries to the front controller. RewriteRule . ENVBASEapp.php [L] ltIfModulegt  ltIfModule modrewrite.cgt ltIfModule modalias.cgt      When modrewrite is not available, we instruct a temporary redirect of      the start page to the front controller explicitly so that the website      and the generated links can still be used.

Negative 7027 pIm making a root access app which generates touch event from the background. Generating touch events requires codeINJECTEVENTScode permission which is actually a Signature level permission. Since I cannot have the same signature as the ROM so I thought of two solutions as of now p  ol lipCreate a .jar class out of a class which actually generates the touch event and call the method of this class from my app and pass coordinates as the arguments. And then push this jar file to codesystemframeworkcodepli lipThe second thing which I thought of was to inject the above created class inside the codeframework.jarcode only and then call the method of the class.pli ol  pI wanted to ask which of the solution might work or if anyone has another idea in their mind, it would be great.p

Furthermore, there is functionality where my client can select which passengers to group. p  pIm not sure how to go about setting up this table or how to query it in a way that each family will increment appropriately.

Negative 7027 pFor a scripting engine I try to integrate C into F Interactive so that I can declare Cclasses inside of F Interactive.

As an example the repeating views that are required are like this. from the edittext with id etsaleproductname up to the linearlayout with id lay1 inclusive is the part that once the button to proceed is clicked should reappear below the current one filled with data.

Negative 7027 pIm using C and have a simple client .exe that when handed a file name, it does process it and return success or error code. I want to create a Windows C .exe that does the following and was looking for sample code to do itp  ul liStart 4 or x client .exe as separate process for ex. using CreateProcessli liWhile the list of the files is not empty Send work to clients Each client will process a sent file name and return either successbr or error codeli liOnce the list of files to process is empty or the producer .exe shutdown close thebr 4 clients so they shutdown.li ul  pI did some research on this and found that pipes can be used to communicate between process. I found this sample app that does a communication between a server and client in c a hrefhttpscode.msdn.microsoft.comwindowsappsCppNamedPipeServerd1778534 relnofollowhttpscode.msdn.microsoft.comwindowsappsCppNamedPipeServerd1778534ap  pThe sample app does however sends request from client to server and get a response and I wanted to modify it or use a different sample app to do batch processing through having a common queue of work or pipe that store this queue or batch of work and send work to clients. I want to synchronize this work so as soon as client is done with one file, Ill send it another file to process.p  pBasically I want to create a sample application .exe that start multiple clients and send them work through interprocess communication. Any sample C code to do this is appreciated.p  pThanksp  pJeff Lacostep

Negative 7027 pI have a databasecolumn that contains some XMLdata as a string. Hence I do not know the actual type that is represented by this xml I want to read the roottag of this XML and than deserialize the complete content with this type. Because the embedded XML may be quite large and the table contains some thousand of these objects I need a fast solution for this. My first approach was on simply extracting the roottag using some stringmagic probably using Regex, get the type by calling codeType.GetTypecode and then create the serializer for this type. But than I had a look on codeXMLReadercode which also supports a codeValueTypecodeproperty. p  precodeusing XmlReader reader  XmlReader.Createnew StringReadermyXmlAsString      reader.MoveToContent  get the rootelement     Type type  reader.ValueType      XmlSerializer ser  new XmlSerializertype     return ser.Deserializereader  codepre  pThe problem I have to face is that codereader.ValueTypecode always returns stringtype rather then the type represented by the roottag. p  pFinally which of the two solutions would be faster Bottleneck on first one is supposed to be the regexengine to get the tapeName, on second approach it might be readeroperations. p

Negative 7027 pI wanted to use strongAzure APIstrong management for exposing our existing emAPIsem to thirdparty developers. Azure API management provides a developer portal where third parties can signin and obtain subscription keys. The subscription key is then supposed to be passed with every request as query string parameter or along with strongPOSTstrong parameters.p  pThis seems to be a concern since there is a possibility of someone easily getting access to this key if they can intercept strongHTTPstrong traffic. The common mechanism is to generate HMAC of the request using client secret and sending it along with the request to ensure integrity and authenticity of the request and not send the client secret along with the request. p  ul lipIs it possible to enable strongHMACstrong based integrity checks on Azure API Management pli lipAlso is it possible to configure strongAzure APIstrong Management to send back the response with HMAC so that client as well can verify that the response is coming from a reliable sourcepli ul

Negative 7027 pI am trying to get a page that redraws a set of google charts every minute.  I have successfully been able to reload the entire page every minute, but am hoping I can redraw the graphs specifically instead.

When I shorten it to 100 ms, it does work and loads the graphs.  This indicates an issue with accessing the initialize function after a certain amount of time after the page has loaded possibly.

When I check the database in MySQL Workbench, the codestatuscode table does not show up at all, which makes me think it is actually failing on the create table command.p

Negative 7027 pIve created an asp.net page not MVC using the outofbox template that is created by VS 2010, which includes login controls, using forms authentication. The page provides data review and editing for users in our offices around the Southwest. I am able to access simple enough information from the login database such as names, roles, and email addresses.p  pThe development site and the production site are both on my development computer, if that makes sense. Our actual production site is still under construction, but users are accessing the site through my computer set up as an asp.net server.p  pAt any rate, what I need to do is to create an administrative feature that allows me or other admin users to make changes to the membership data, such as updating email addresses or deleting users.p  pUsing the Membership class, I am able to access the membership data on the development site, but when I deploy it to the temp production site it still shows the user data on the development site.p  pIts clear that the site on the production server is working fine for our users  i.e. they are able to create their user accounts and to actually log in but the membership class does not show any of the actual users, only my faux users in the development space.p  pMy web.config file contains these linesp  precodeltconnectionStringsgt     ltadd nameApplicationServices connectionStringdata source.SQLEXPRESSIntegrated SecuritySSPIAttachDBFilenameDataDirectoryaspnetdb.mdfUser Instancetrue providerNameSystem.Data.SqlClient gt     ltadd nameConnectionString connectionStringData SourceMAINSERVERSQLEXPRESSInitial CatalogXYZIntegrated SecurityTrue providerNameSystem.Data.SqlClient gt   ltconnectionStringsgt codepre  pWhich seems like it ought to point to the aspnetdb.mdf file in the operating folder.p  pIve added a gridview just to get familiar with how this all words, and the VB codebehind includes the following lines p  precodeGridView1.DataSource  Membership.GetAllUsers GridView1.DataBind codepre  pWhich works great except it only shows the users in the development site.p  pI clearly do not understand the loginmembership structure.p  pCan anyone shed some light on this for mep  pEDIT per request from Winp  pFrom the Debug folderp  precodeltmembershipgt   ltprovidersgt     ltcleargt     ltadd nameAspNetSqlMembershipProvider typeSystem.Web.Security.SqlMembershipProvider connectionStringNameApplicationServices enablePasswordRetrievalfalse enablePasswordResettrue requiresQuestionAndAnswerfalse requiresUniqueEmailfalse maxInvalidPasswordAttempts5 minRequiredPasswordLength6 minRequiredNonalphanumericCharacters0 passwordAttemptWindow10 applicationNamegt   ltprovidersgt ltmembershipgt ltroleManager enabledtruegt   ltprovidersgt     ltcleargt     ltadd connectionStringNameApplicationServices applicationName nameAspNetSqlRoleProvider typeSystem.Web.Security.SqlRoleProvidergt     ltadd applicationName nameAspNetWindowsTokenRoleProvider typeSystem.Web.Security.WindowsTokenRoleProvidergt   ltprovidersgt ltroleManagergt codepre  pfrom the production folderp  precodeltmembershipgt   ltprovidersgt     ltcleargt     ltadd nameAspNetSqlMembershipProvider typeSystem.Web.Security.SqlMembershipProvider connectionStringNameApplicationServices enablePasswordRetrievalfalse enablePasswordResettrue requiresQuestionAndAnswerfalse requiresUniqueEmailfalse maxInvalidPasswordAttempts5 minRequiredPasswordLength6 minRequiredNonalphanumericCharacters0 passwordAttemptWindow10 applicationNamegt   ltprovidersgt ltmembershipgt ltroleManager enabledtruegt   ltprovidersgt     ltcleargt     ltadd connectionStringNameApplicationServices applicationName nameAspNetSqlRoleProvider typeSystem.Web.Security.SqlRoleProvidergt     ltadd applicationName nameAspNetWindowsTokenRoleProvider typeSystem.Web.Security.WindowsTokenRoleProvidergt   ltprovidersgt ltroleManagergt codepre  pNear as I can tell, theyre identical, and nothing there gives me a clue how to fix it.

Negative 7027 pFor an ASP.NET SPA app, the code template that ships with VS2013 is very different from the code template that ships with VS2013 Updates 234. For reference, heres the same template fromp  pVS2013 a hrefhttpswww.dropbox.comsnc9t691adg2q9acOldTemplate.zipdl0 relnofollowhttpswww.dropbox.comsnc9t691adg2q9acOldTemplate.zipdl0ap  pVS2013 update 4 a hrefhttpswww.dropbox.comssk8qajyxy4kx4m3NewTemplate.zipdl0 relnofollowhttpswww.dropbox.comssk8qajyxy4kx4m3NewTemplate.zipdl0ap  pThe biggest difference seems to be that logging in with the original template is done without a postback, entirely through JavaScript which seems to keep with the SPA spirit. But in the later version of the template, a full postback happens during login. There is a plethora of other changes that seem connected to this main change, for example, in the older version there exists this method inside ApplicationOAuthProvider.csp  precodepublic override async Task GrantResourceOwnerCredentialsOAuthGrantResourceOwnerCredentialsContext context              using UserManagerltIdentityUsergt userManager  userManagerFactory                      IdentityUser user  await userManager.FindAsynccontext.UserName, context.Password              if user  null                              context.SetErrorinvalidgrant, The user name or password is incorrect.                 return                           ClaimsIdentity oAuthIdentity  await userManager.CreateIdentityAsyncuser,                 context.Options.AuthenticationType             ClaimsIdentity cookiesIdentity  await userManager.CreateIdentityAsyncuser,                 CookieAuthenticationDefaults.AuthenticationType             AuthenticationProperties properties  CreatePropertiesuser.UserName             AuthenticationTicket ticket  new AuthenticationTicketoAuthIdentity, properties             context.Validatedticket             context.Request.Context.Authentication.SignIncookiesIdentity               codepre  pThis method is completely omitted from the newer template.p  pWould appreciate any insight as to why such significant changes were made. I dont see any advantages, and for a SPAstyle app I prefer the lack of postback. But perhaps there were important security or design reasons considered which I should also consider.p  pThanks... Benp

Negative 7027 pIt seems that JSF 2.0 does not call class level constraints. Quoting from an a hrefhttpstackoverflow.coma92137631803692SO answerap  blockquote   pJSF 2.0 doesnt call class level validation constraints. From a hrefhttpwww.mastertheboss.comwebinterfaces293jsfvalidationtutorial.htmlshowall1 relnofollowJSF validationa JSF 2 provides builtin integration with JSR303 constraints. When you are using bean validation in your application, JSF automatically uses the constraints for beans that are referenced by UIInput values.p blockquote  pThe answer furthermore suggests using SeamFaces to validate the classlevel constraints anyways.p  pUnfortunately this is a nonoption, since it introduces a somewhat massive dependency for just validating what should be validated anyways.p  pMy question thus isp  h3How can I get JSF to validate classlevel constraintsh3  pManual validation in the controller is tedious and a lot of repeated code, and thus an option I would like to avoid.p  pI have attempted to do this by annotating the ControllerField to be validated with codeValidcode, which didnt help.p  pI emguessem it should be possible to either make the Process Validations phase do that for me or hook in something akin to a codeFiltercode after the Update Model Values phase, that would centrally run the model values through a Validation.p

Negative 7027 pSo heres my problem summed upp  pI have this form, in page X for the sake of example that submits data to a processing page, whose address is a URL mapped by Apaches RewriteRule. This forms action URL has a session hash key as a GET query that would be required for it to go through, and this changes with every page load for each user. That session hash isnt changed when you are in the processing page. Normally it would go through, but in this case it wouldnt.  p  pAfter a while of investigating, I figured the most likely reason that this is happening is that the mapped URL must have redirected through pages somehow when Apache processed the .htaccess file containing all the rewrite conditions, and changed the session hash key in the mapped page X. I found this out when I used the original unmapped URL thats page Xwhich would be index.phpsnowglobesnowglobe as opposed to sgsnowglobe. I dont know whats causing the mapped URL to change the session hash, and for that matter how to fix this problem.p  pThe PHP snippet containing the session hashp  precode    ifissetGET[verify]     SESSION[tempn]    md5microtimetrue this changes at every page except the processing page codepre  pThe .htaccess filep  precodeRewriteEngine On RewriteRule profile[AZaz09]    index.phpprofile1        [PT] RewriteRule thread[AZaz09]    index.phpthreadview1   [PT] RewriteRule profilenuise[AZaz09]    index.phpquery1   [PT] RewriteRule profilenuise[AZaz09]notifs    index.phpquery1ampnotifsall                                                    [PT] RewriteRule profilenuise[AZaz09]find[AZaz]    index.phpquery1ampfind2                                      [PT] RewriteRule profilenuise[AZaz09]find[AZaz]    index.phpfind2ampquery1                                     [PT]                          RewriteRule profilenuise[AZaz09]find[AZaz]submit    index.phpfind2ampquery1ampdirect2submit                                 [PT] RewriteRule thread[AZaz09]comment[az09]    index.phpcomment2ampthreadview1                                                   [PT] RewriteRule thread[AZaz09]comment[az09]    index.phpthreadview1ampcomment2                                               [PT] RewriteRule sg[AZaz09]    index.phpsnowglobe1      [PT] codepre  pThe HTML formp  precode echo ltdiv idcontent classcontentboxgt.nx[31].ltdivgt echo ltform methodPOST action.maindir.index.phpdirectnewpostampverify.

Negative 7027 pIn general, I always pass pointers through functions of any objects I create if I need something done to an object, I would pass it by pointer rather than by reference.

This is vital to understand because doObject has an assignment of someObject called pObject. Deleting someObject before doObject means theres a dangling pointer which implies any actions on it would produce a segmentation fault.pli lipIf I delete doObject first in main.cpp, does that also delete pObject AS WELL AS so of type someObject After all, they are linked.pli lipIf I create a new class that also a function which also requires a parameter of someObject, does that mean pObject no longer points to so Should I instead use a shared pointer so that its possible for both classes to be able to point to so and change the object as necessarypli lipHow can the code be improved Should I consider the use of smart pointers to ensure that I do not delete an object more than once in various parts of a programpli ol  pYes, the question is rather complex but thats what you get with pointersp

Negative 7027 pMy question is I have a asp.net web services and its azure project for creating a azure package that I deployed over azure. So that my webservice is online over auzure a hrefhttpsomeservices.cloudapp.netexposed relnofollowhttpsomeservices.cloudapp.netexposeda . I have another asp.net project that is not directly related to services no reference of service and use and with its own azure project to create cspkg etc. for deployment a hrefhttpmyproject.cloudapp.net relnofollowhttpmyproject.cloudapp.neta. Now I have two URLs hosted seperately one for web service and another for my project application.  Can I somehow add service project in my normal project so that  they have a single cspkg and settings to deploy only as a single URL, though web service can have more qualified URL to access. For example my application can say still use a hrefhttpmyproject.cloudapp.net relnofollowhttpmyproject.cloudapp.neta and services can be access something like a hrefhttpmyproject.cloudapp.netexposed relnofollowhttpmyproject.cloudapp.netexposeda  This will reduce the cloud cost of having different hosting and URL.p
Negative 7027 pI dont know if I have some kind of design flaw in what I am writing but im a little stuck as to the approach I am currently trying to use.p  pI have a case in my ViewModel where I want to do clamping on certain values based on the emcurrent state of the usercontrolem. For this to work, I need to bind to properties on that control and ensure that the ViewModel emalways knows about its current stateem.p  pIn one instance, this works great. If a value changes on the control, the DependencyProperty of the View says, hey, ive changed. And the data is pushed to my ViewModel. Brilliantp  pThe problem arises when my ViewModel is switched out, and the View doesnt change. A great example of this would be the Views ActualWidth and ActualHeight. Upon a ViewModel switch effectively removing the old one, and reinstantiating a new one. The DependencyPropertys will not change. Thus my new view model never recieves the data of the view.p  pThis means that somehow my Control MUST know when its ViewModel changes. Right p  pIf this all makes sense, how do I go about pushing the new values to my view model. Even if they havent changedp

Negative 7027 pI just dont understand why this exception is occurring. I have a custom adapter for my codeGridViewcode, where I use a model to create a type codePhotoGridItemcode class for my codeArrayListltPhotoGridItemgtcode, which is just a bunch of codeBitmapcode images I pull from my SD card. p  pCompile time there are no errors, but when I run, I get codejava.lang.ClassCastException android.graphics.Bitmap cannot be cast to org.azurespot.cutecollection.PhotoGridItemcode. Yet the line it points out is this codePhotoGridItem photoGridItem  photos.getpositioncode, where there are no codeBitmapscode by reference, the codephotoscode variable is a reference to codeArrayListltPhotoGridItemgtcode and the codegetcode simply gets the codePhotoGridItemcode object at that position. p  pNow... the items inside codePhotoGridItemcode are all codeBitmapcode as shown by the model class, but thats not what Android Studio thinks at compile time. It definitely considers codephotos.getpositioncode to be a PhotoGridItem object in my codeArrayListcode. So I dont know why this exception is coming up or how to fix it. p  pI basically need a codeBitmapcode for the lines that follow, this one codeholder.image.setImageBitmapbmcode but it wont accept codephotos.getpositioncode because at compile time it thinks its a codePhotoGriditemcode object So this feels like Android Studio is a little schizophrenic to me.

Negative 7027 pBasically, I am now making a basic social network app on iOS platform, using PHP as the backend. I am be able to make the login, register functions in my social network app, however, I am now struggling how to add friend in my app. p  pAs far as I know, I have to make a table for makingfriends, just following this tutorial a hrefhttpwww.9lessons.info201403facebookstylefriendrequestsystem.html relnofollowhttpwww.9lessons.info201403facebookstylefriendrequestsystem.htmla  p  pHowever, what I wonder is, if one user send a friend request to another user, then the status in the makingfriends table maybe 0, to indicate that the friend request is sent and waiting for the reply. But how to let the other user know, that a user is sending a friend request to him, and then the other user may accept the friend request and updating the status to 1, which means the other user accepts the friend request.p  pIn a word, I am not sure how to communicate from one client to another client, using server as a bridge. Does anyone have any good suggestionsp

Negative 7027 pIve successfully implemented a java program that uses two common data structures a codeTreecode and a codeStackcode along with an interface that allows a user to enter in a tree node ID and get information about it in relation to its parent. You can look at the latest version of this program here a hrefhttpsgithub.comasobinsobintreemasterPhyloTLaCsrcat my GitHub src for this programa p  pstrongBackgroundstrongp  pThis ad hoc program I wrote is used to study the evolution of gene flow across hundreds of organisms by comparing data in a file that consists of FeatureIDs  codeStringcode primitives further down these are listed in the first column as codeATM0000011code, codeATM0000012code, and so on, and consists of the scores that are associated with their presence or absence at a particular node in the tree and these are codedoublecode primitives.     p  pHere is what the data file looks likep  precodeFeatureID,112,115,120,119,124,...this line has all tree node IDs ATM0000011,2.213e03,1.249e03,7.8e04,9.32e04,1.472e03,... scores on these lines ATM0000012,2.213e03,1.249e03,7.8e04,9.32e04,1.472e03,...correspond to node ID ATM0000013,0.94,1.249e03,7.8e04,9.32e04,1.472e03,...order in the first line ... 30000 lines later ATM0036186,0.94,0.96,0.97,0.95,0.95,... codepre  pstrongThe Problemstrongp  pPreviously, it was good enough to just make a 2D array of the doubles from the data file the array excluded the first line in the file and the FeatureIDs, because theyre Strings, and use the 2D array to then make codedoublecode stacks. The stacks would be made for parent and child nodes as determined by user input and the codeTreecode. p  pThe data in the parent and child stacks would then be popped off at the same time thus ensuring that the same FeatureIDs were being compared without actually having to include that data in the DS and have their values compared based on whether they met a defined condition ie. if both values were  0.75. Iff they did, a counter would be incremented. Once the comparisons were finished stacks were empty the program would return the counts.p  pNow what I want to do instead of just counting, is make a lists of which FeatureIDs met the comparison criteria. So instead of returning the counter that says there were 4100 FeatureIDs between node A and node B that met the criteria, I want a list of all 4100 FeatureID codeStringscode that met the criteria being compared between node A and node B. Im going to save that list as a file later but thats not of concern here. This means that Ill probably have to abandon the codedoublecode 2D arraycodedoublecode stack scheme which had previously worked so well.p  pstrongThe Questionstrongp  pKnowing what the problem is, is there a clever fix to this problem where I could make a change to the input data file, or somewhere in my code tlacMain.java, without adding much more data to the process I just need ideas.p

For instance, I have the following directive templatep  precodeltbuttonDirectivegt   ltmdicon mdsvgsrcandroid.svg altandroid gtltmdicongt ltbuttonDirectivegt codepre  pKarma yells at me that android.svg is being called the known GET error Unexpected request GET IMAGEFILEPATH.p  pIve tried to add my image files to the karma config, but this did not solve the issue.p  pAny way around this besides not using the mdicon it works when I change the m dicon to a simple image, so I guess the issue is that the mdicon directive is using some async call to the svg file and Karma hates that....p

Lets assume there are the website www.exampleaa which correspond to aa and www.examplebb which correspond to bb. If I edit aa, I like to reload www.examplea and not www.examplebbp  pNote that I dont want to reload a special file like css. At the best it would be a free glob in the reload method.p  pIf you have to have a concrete example.  Consider a website, which has different user  like www.bmx.comaxelprofile. If axel edit some pages in his directory like profile.top.html, he doesnt want berta to send a browser reload. Another example would be a bigger project where you can map the file to specific websites. If 10 developer edit pages they dont want to disturb their neighbours.p

Negative 7027 pThis might be a bit of a long shot, but here goes.p  pI use a Basic4android app I have created to connect to an external Bluetooth Barcode Scanner, The Unitech MS910. I can connect and receive the scanned barcodes in my app with no issues.p  pThe MS910 has a button that you press in order to start the scanner scanning, I have noticed in a couple of other android applications that they are able to open the keyboard on the android phone by double clicking the button on the scanner and this is the functionality I would like to be able to include in my application.p  pThe scanner connects to the app via a Serial Connection, which raises an event when new TextData is avalible on the connection, the problem is as just clicking the button does create any text and this event is not raised.p  pHaving done lots of searching for an answer I have found that events from Bluetooth can be accessed via intents, as an example, to capture the connected event, I add the Following to the manifest p  precodeAddPermissionandroid.permission.BLUETOOTH  AddReceiverTexts1, ltintentfiltergt  ltaction androidnameandroid.bluetooth.device.action.ACLCONNECTEDgt  ltintentfiltergt codepre  pUsing a Service called s1, I can get the event as followsp  precodeSub ServiceStart StartingIntent As Intent    LogStartingIntent    LogStartingIntent.ExtrasToString End Sub codepre  pI think the button click may also fire an event , but Im not sure what the text would need to be in the manifest or what the  would be.p  pSo I was wondering if anybody out there has any idea what Im talking about, and could point me in the right direction.p  pRegards amp Thanksp  pPotmanp

Negative 7027 pIm developing a big web application that uses JSF and hibernate as its ORM. My hibernate sessions are long the user can do big amount of modifications on the screen and the changes will only be persistent on DB when hell press the save button Im recently struggling with an issue of rollback  cancellation of user modification and looking for different solutions and approaches.p  pI want to recover from a violation constraint exception ORA02292 integrity constraint.p  pConsider the following scenariobr there is a table X with a record x and a table Y with a record y  where x Depends on y by a foreign key. The user is trying to delete record y and although there is a future possible integrity constraint violation on this step, Im not throwing any exception because the user is able to fix it later and only if he wont fix it and try to save the screen the DB will throw an exception which will be aggregated to the user interface.p  pI cant find a good way to recover from this violation.br In the save process, after trying to delete record y, DB launches the ORA02292 integrity constraint exception as expected.br My problem is that if such an error occurred and the user did fixed the foreign key constraint by selecting another record instead of y, hibernate wont recognize it because AFAIK it will still first try to remove y because of the action queue and fail before it comes to the action that replaces y with another entity.br So whats going on is that the DB keeps firing exceptions while trying to save changes and I cant find a way to fix it without refreshing the entire screen which means that the new hibernate session loosing all of the user new data. it seems like the action queue saves the delete action and wont clear it even if Session evict or clear methods are called.p  pI am aware that I could validate changes before committing them and that it might work but Im not interested in this kind of solution because 1. validate a large amount of possible changes can cause a performance issue, furthermore I believe that oracle DB can do it for me much better. 2. I dont want to enforce the user to a specific order of actions.p  hr  pstrongUPDATEstrongp  pI feel that I should shed some light on the application requirementsbr The application was built in a way that committing changes to DB can only occur at the save phase  strongThis is a user demand and unfortunately its not open for discussionstrong,br The idea behind it is that the user wants to make changes without a specific kind of order and fix wrong set of data whenever he wants to before pressing the save button.br As a result of this requirement, validation is also preferred to take place in the save phase.br I am aware of the possibility of validating each one of the user modification right away as Dragan Bozanovic pointed out bellow, but as I said this is not the preferred way by the user.p  pSo, as I see it I can solve the problem in three different waysbr strong1.strong  Validate all modifications in the save phase  as I said it can be a     performance issue because there can be many validations to make.br strong2.strong Validate each user modification right away  again this is not the preferred option by the user but will do if must.br strong3.strong Find a way of handling such scenarios of integrity constraint... in the DB level  strongIll appreciate more suggestions, if any, to this approachstrong.p

Negative 7027 pI am currently working on optimizing a project of mine that is a few years old now. The purpose is to draw an image after hitting a certain combination of keys. The original version that I made a few years ago manually moved to each square section, but Ive recently optimized it to draw rectangles for consecutive squares which makes it a lot faster. p  pThe next step I want to take is optimizing the way the program draws a given layout, but I dont know where to start looking.

My question is why is this not taken all the way so you have the symmetric syntaxp  precodev lt c codepre  pin order to receive from a channel Why have the equals sign therep  pI suppose the interpreter would end up with adjacent syntax tokens likep  precode[variable][value] codepre  pwhich could conceivably come from a statement likep  precodev 1  codepre  pSo that the equals sign there allows you to reuse the usual variable assignment machinery by making that channel receipt evaluate to a value. Would it be that difficult to make the interpreter accept the version without the equals sign though It would basically just have to treat it as a binary operator for that case.p  pIt also seems to lead to other cases where if there are two channels codec1code and codec2code you have the syntaxp  precodec2 lt lt c1 codepre  pIn order to read from one and transmit it into the other. p  hr  pId like to also say that Im not trying to elicit opinions on style but rather trying to understand the decisions drove Go to be the way it is.p

Negative 7027 pI understand thats not a very specific question, but still asking in hope as its something I dont have much knowledge of. p  pWe have .net desktop application which runs as schedules service daily on the server uploads about 80M records from csv files. then afcourse we have lot of algorithms going on the data after the uploading. this whole process takes around 7 hrs. p  pAs a server setup we have a dedicated window server with sql server 2008 R2. So we have our site and our application  data uploading running there. strongBut when application is running our site becomes slower and sometimes unresponsivestrong I totally understand the reason. but dont know the way out. p  pJust to be more clear, we have two databases. while the uploading is going on site is using the second database.. After uploading databases are switched so application use the latest data.p  pIn my mind I can think of following.. Just thoughts, I dont even know if possible.p  ol liPerhaps there can be like two machines. one for data uploading and one for serving sites. but somehow both can use the same sql server. I hope with this sort of structure, resources being used by the desktop application wouldnt slow down the site as that has its own resources to useli ol  p2. Perhaps I can limit the cpumemory that can be used by the application. p  pNote few of the queries gets very complicated and runs long. sometimes upto 30 minutes. Using IIS as web server.p

Negative 7027 pI have a CMake project I am working on, and when I run codemakecode then the rebuild of one of the targets is getting triggered regardless of whether I touch any of the files in the system. I have managed to discover that this is because one of the files on which the target depends is somehow getting deleted when I run codemakecode, so the system registers that it needs to be rebuilt. I tried setting codechattr icode on this file to make it immutable and indeed, with this flag set, the rebuilding of the target is not triggered, though there are also no errors from a deletion attempt. But I think I can be sure that this is the culprit. p  pSo now my question. How can I figure out what script or makefile is actually deleting this file It is a big project with quite a few scripts and submakefiles which potentially run at different times during the build, so I am having a hard time manually discovering what is doing this. Is there some nice trick I can pull from the filesystem side to help I tried doing codestrace makecode, but parsing the output I cant seem to find the filename appearing anywhere. I am no codestracecode expert though, so perhaps the file is getting deleted via some identifier rather than the filename Or I am not stracing spawned processes perhapsp

However we are wanting to have this run for all users during the weekend when they arent logged in. Im new to Vb Script as well as coding in general. Different thoughts to resolve this would be to run a loopback of all our user profiles which will write each username found to an array.

Negative 7027 pThe RTMP protocol is meant to automatically try to deliver media over different ports in the following sequence 1935  443  80p  pSome of my users complain that they cannot watch my stream, and I suggest them to try the RTMPT tunneling which instructs the player to directly go to port 80 bypassing other default ports.p  pNow when it comes to testing, I do not seem to be able to replicate the issue my users are having For example, when I block the port 1935 in my firewall, the stream stops, but upon reload continues to play over 443. If I in turn block the port 443, the stream stops yet again and continues to play over port 80 after reload.p  pWhy is it that me blocking the port 1935 and 443 does not cause a significant impact and RTMP still finds its way to go over port 80 How can I replicate the issue people are having that can only be solved by switching to RTMPTp  pAny help in figuring this out will be greatly appreciatedp

Negative 7027 pI have a worksheet with one Excel table. Time by time I may add or remove rows from that table. I created another table in another worksheet of the same workbook. I wish to automatically change the number of rows of that table to match the number of rows on the first table. Thats because the first column of second table refers to the first column of first table, so the number of rows must be the same. So, if first table has 100 rows, second table must have 100 rows. If I add a row to first table, second table must have 101 rows. If I remove a row from first table, second table must have 99 rows. Is that possible without manually changing each time second tablep

Negative 7027 pI have a difficult if not impossible problem to ask a solution for. I have an Oracle query, and I have to translate it to TSQL syntax. p  pThe query looks like this in Oraclep  precodeselectwrapperselect  from      select rownum rownum, innerc3pquery.       from 0 innerc3pquery       where rownumgtoffset and rownumltoffsetcount or countlt1 codepre  pThis comes from a properties file. Basically, this one line executes any SQL query, names the resultset innerc3pquery, and selects everything from it and also a rownum. Then, it filters the result by the rownum offset and ltoffset  count. So, practically, it executes any SQL query, and returns a limited rowset, e.g. from the 10th row to the 20th.p  pNow, my job is to transform this into TSQL. I spent one and a half day looking up every possible idea, but so far, I havent succeeded. I tried a great many things, neither of them worked. The problem is, I cant use codeROWNUMBERcode function, because it requires at least one column in the codeOVERcode clause, and I cant provide any, because the actual query is only determined at runtime.p  pDo you guys have any idea, or is it really impossible to do on the DB sidep  pThanks in advancep  pGabep

An example will better illustratep  pOrdinarilly with dependencies that do not have codeAssistedcode params you can simply have a complex heirarchy of objects which all have their dependencies and these get injected no problem, I can just get an instance of an object and all its dependencies will be generated and injected without me having to do anything.p  pBut if I wanted to change it so some of the dependencies in the object hierarchy have codeAssistedcode params then I have to create those instances myself using a factory iep  precodepublic SomeConcreteServiceAssisted String string      this.string  string   MyFactory myFactory  injector.getInstanceMyFactory .class SomeService myService  factory.getMyServicesome string codepre  pThis would cause problems for the clean instantiation of the objects because I would have to manually create those instances. and pass them into the required object, which essentially renders the DI for that object redundant I think ie I would then need to use the codenewcode keyword and pass in all dependencies manually...p  precodenew MyComplexObjectmyService, myOtherService codepre  pHow do I make it so that I dont have to manually build the object graph if one or more of the dependencies uses codeAssistedcode parametersp

A click triggers the requestp  precodecasper.thenfunction li10      casper.clickSEARCHBUTTONCSS  codepre  pBut according to my web proxy, the client closes the connection before receiving the entire response.  Ive tried waiting for the URL to appear.

Negative 7027 pSo I learned that its not exactly an easy task to create a progress bar for SQL queries. So Ive tried to come up with an alternative solution to indicate when a task will be done. I figured I could time how long it would take to execute one query in the database and then use that information to create an estimation depending on how many queries that has to be performed and then create a progress bar from that information. I know it will not be a 100 reliable solution, because if something went wrong it would still show the progress bar, but it would at least give the user some indication when the job will be done, rather than just having a loading spinner.p  pIs there a better solution to this problemp  pemedit to answer some questionsemp  pIts the update function that takes time. I have maybe 15.000 inputs in the database and I have to update all 15.000 through an API. So first I have to pull out the id of all those and use them with an API to get the updated information, and then I have to execute all the 15.000 queries with the updated information. All this takes time. I doubt it can be done quickly. With a database of 15.000 queries it took me about 2 hours. I dont believe a spinner for 2 hours without an indication of when it will be done is realiable. I need some sort of estimation. p  pNote that updating the database is something that will be done very rarely. Like maybe once a week the user will update the database.p
