Positive 78160 pOK, Im totally stumped with this one. I may not have enough info to post here, but I dont even know where to start looking. Im trying to Update Model from database on my DAL.edmx file. I included a field to a view that wasnt included prior. I tried refreshing, and then I tried renaming the view in the database and deleting the view from the DAL so I could readd it.

Positive 78160 pI am using Entity Framework 5 code first to talk to an Oracle 11g or 12c database Ive verified the problem in both versions. The Oracle field is a codeFLOATcode type while the field in my POCO is a codedecimalcode.

With the cast the query takes 40 seconds to complete if I remove the cast the query takes 0.47 seconds. p  pI have researched to the point of exhaustion trying to find some way through configuration, data type tweaking or through prayer and animal sacrifice to prevent the query that is produced from Having a CAST in the where. p  pIf anyone has any tips you will make this tired old programmer so very thankful.p

Negative 78160 pI am trying to debug some problems with very pickingcomplex webservices where some of the clients that are theoretically making the same requests are getting different results.  A debugging proxy like Charles helps a lot but since the requests are complex lots of headers, cookies, query strings, form data, etc and the clients create the headers in different orders which should be perfectly acceptable, etc.  its an extremely tedious process to do manually.p  pIm pondering writing something to do this myself but I was hoping someone else had already solved this problemp  pAs an aside does anyone know of any Charleslike debugging proxies that are completely opensource If Charles were open source I would definitely contribute any work I did on this front back to the project.  If there is something similar out there, I would much rather do this than write an separate program from scratch especially since I imagine Charles or any analog already has all of the data structures I might need etc.p  pEdit Just to be clear  text diffing will not work as the order of lines e.g. headers at least may be different andor the order of values within lines e.g. cookies at least can be different and in both cases as long as the names and values and metadata are all the same, the different ordering should not cause requests that are otherwise the same to be considered different.p

Negative 78160 pIve got a rendering extension for reporting services which uses the ReportExecution2005.asmx service to execute a number of subreports and then puts the results in a powerpoint presentation.p  pA typical usage scenario would be to go to the Report Manager, select my Powerpoint report, which is used only as a placeholder for parameters to be passed to the subreports. I then select my extension from the list of export formats and click Export, which runs the extension and it gives me back my pptx file.p  pThis works fine on both our live and test servers. But Ive run into a very weird problem trying to set up another test server.p  pAny call made by the extension to the webservice returns with 401 Access Denied no further substatus information available.p  pThings Ive tried without success  allow physical access to the folder structure of the ReportServer virtual directory to everyone. And I mean literally everyone  ASPNET, NETWORK SERVICE, Everyone, the account I usually use to log in, which is an admin and owner of the folder  use reporting manager to set up the security on the reporting services side. Again, every conceivable usergroup account which could be involved was given every conceivable role.  allow anonymous access to the ReportServer web app.  enabled impersonation on the ReportServer web app.  hardcoded the user credentials to use when calling the webservice by default it just uses System.Net.CredentialCache.DefaultCredentialsp  pI also made a little test website which consumes the ReportExecution service in exactly the same way as the RenderingExtension, and from the website, the web server authenticates fine and allows me to call the web service, so obviously the problem doesnt lie with the web service security setup itself.p  pStarting to pull my hair out. As a last resort, Im about to reinstal Reporting Services, but in the mean time or if that doesnt help  if anyone has encountered something similar, Id greatly appreciate any input.p

Now even though i have 10 sets in total i am only suppose to show 5 this is where the random comes in play im supposed to make it choose between the complement and original randomely so lets say in one set is gonna show the first complement and then ask me if my number is in that said i said no then the next set of number shows this time is the original of the second set. what i cant figure out is how to do that...for the first question to radomely choose between the original and the complement ampamp then do the same but for the second questions and so forth till the fifth question.p
Negative 78160 pId like to parse formatted basic values and a few custom strings from a codeTextReadercode  essentially like codescanfcode allows.p  ul liMy input might not have linebreaks, so ReadLineRegex isnt an option.  I could use some other way of chunking text input but the problem is that I dont know the delimiter at compile time so thats tricky, and that that delimiter might be localizationdependant.  For instance, a float followed by a comma might be 1.5, or 1,5, but in both cases attempting to parse the float should be greedy.li liTo be safe, Id like to assume my input is actively hostile say, streaming in from a network stream i.e. intentionally missing chunking delimiters.li liId like to avoid custom Regexs int.Parse and double.Parse work well and are localizationaware.

Negative 78160 pLet me explain the scenario. We have a legacy C compiled .so library. The functions in this library are declared with codeextern c code, so the library can be used by both C and C program, plus, for some reason it was created withcodestaticlibgcccode option. p  pThis old library is very old and hard to maintain. Now we haved managed to write a subsitution of it, but in C language. Lets say the old library is called libfoo.soold, and new one is libfoo.sonew. For a given bar.o, it can be linked with either old or new libfoo.so to create a executable, say, bar.exe. But the bar.exe can only run with the same .so library it linked before, by the other words, these two libraries are not mutual exchangable.p  pstrongEDIT1strong I made a symbolic link named libfoo.so to point to libfoo.soold or libfoo.sonew. This symbolic link libfoo.so is in LDLIBRARYPATH at runtime.p  pstrongEDIT2strong When I linked bar.o with old libfoo.so and generated bar.exe, if I run this bar.exe with new libfoo.so, it reported error of codeundefined symbolscode. By codenmcode these two libfoo.so, I can find out these symbols in old one, but not in new one. The symbols are something like codeZSt4cerrcode, which is a C lib mangled nameI though it was brought by codestaticlibgcccode, and of course the new libfoo.so does not contains those kind of symbols.p  pstrongEDIT3strong If I just compile and link the C code with g instead of gcc, does it make any sensep  pHow should I implement thisp  pstrongEDIT4strong Today I managed to compilelink the new C programed libfoo with g with static libgcc, static libstdc, this can lead to all c symbols to be contained in libfoo.so. This can make everything run smoothly, but not what I really want.p

Negative 78160 pI am trying to store metadata basically a unique id along with each cell of a table in a Word document.  Currently, for the addin Im developing, I am querying the database, and building a table inside the Word document using the data that is retrieved.p  pI want to be able to save any of the users edits to the document, and persist it back to the database.

I found that I could add the needed information into the ID property of the cell  however, that information was not retained if the user saved the document, closed it, and reopened it.

For example the following DOM elements are created when the page loads and are wrapped into an existing div defined in a viewp  pmyform.append myform.appendp  pWhen I click the submit button I need to get the values of the input form whose id is Name Name.val and then I return a Json object  Name name p  pFor this kind of scenario there is no way to use Html.Encode or AntiXss.HtmlEncode on the clientside. The only way to check if the input is not harmful is done on the serverside via a service layer.p  pThis seems a limitation. All is fine if and only if a view has a set of predefined inputs. When it is time to create them on the fly, the situation is different.p  pHave you thought of that situation guys p  pThanks for the attention you have put on this.p  pRoland Brussels, Belgiump

Naturally, I dont want to work on a bytelevel throughout my application I want to separate the protocol from my application code.

Negative 78160 pThis question actually has two parts.p  pThe first partp  pIve been developing my first app for a couple of weeks now. I have 5 screens and everything seems well. However, Im considering changing the apps navigation to a TabView.p  pI havent delved much into it, but Im hoping someone can save me a little bit of time. It seems that people dont generally place Activities inside each tab. They simply point the tab content to a View. This is where my major setbacks are. 1 I already have Activity classes full of code and 2 I cant quickly guess how the structure of an app using TabView looks. For example, where do I put the handler code for clicking a button on a View Does it all just get dumped into the TabView Activity somehowp  pWhat I would like is if you could please give me a quick synopsis of what Im looking at doing, answers to any questions you think I may have, and point me toward some resources for creating TabView applications. A quick Google search really just shows me how to create a TabView Activity and add a couple tabs to it. The code doesnt go any deeper.  For example, say I have a layout xml to show in one of my tabs content pane, where does the code go for clicking a button I have in that layoutp  pThe second partp  pIve added a TabActivity to wrap the Activities I currently have in.  At the moment I have Activities populating the content of my tabs though ultimately Id like to do this in the most efficient fashion, which doesnt seem to be having Activities be tab content. Ive noticed something rather annoying. My MAIN Activity is an Activity I wrote for my user to log in to their account. After logging in, they are taken to my Tab Activity. Here is what happensp  pWhen I am on my Tab Activity and I minimize the app by clicking the Home button and then launch it again, I dont get taken back to the Tab Activity. I get taken to my log in Activity. Why I dont have the launchMode of my Tab Activity set to singleInstance... or is it singleInstance by default How can I make the app relaunch showing the Tab Activity ideally by setting some parameter, assuming Im doing something wrong, and not having to save this data off somewhere and reading it and programmatically telling it what to go top  pThank you for all your time and helpp

Now, the way I understand it I may be completely wrong, the crucial error causing the make command to fail usually shows up in the last lines in the output, no Anyway, at this point, I might do something like codecat INSTALLcode to read up on the INSTALL document to check whether theres something Ive missed. NOW, if I want to go back to see what the error was, that caused my initial make command to fail, I then have to manually scroll up to that position again, since my codecat INSTALLcode command printed a ton of text after it.p  pI dont know if this scenario is the most elucidative  but there are many other situations where I wish I could just jump back to previous prompt lines and check up on previous command output whether it was a simple codelscode command, codemakecode, codegit statuscode, or whatever it was  swapping positions in the window by means of using prompt lines as bookmark positions seems an interesting idea to me.p

Im considering some sort of calculation pool that maintains instances of the calculator and keeps track of which ones are currently being used, but I havent figured out the details.p  pDoes anyone with experience of similar situations have any suggestions As long as the solution can run on a Windows box, all technology options can be considered.p

Negative 78160 pI have a website and I need to place a web application inside one of its pages. The web application obviously has many pages and they are of varying heights. I was thinking of placing it inside an iFrame. However, with an iFrame, I have the auto height problem. Since the links change within the iFrame itself, it is more difficult to adjust its height, since only the contents inside the iFrame itself will be changing and not the actual page itself i.e. the URL.p  pIs there a more clever and cleaner way how I can implement this without using an iFrame.p  pI also tried using ssi includes but for some reason, they are working everywhere else but when I place the application inside an include, it wont work.p  pMany thanksp

Negative 78160 pOn a MVC View .aspx enclosed in a Form, there are several controls  grids, textboxes  that display data relating to a subject, a person. The form does not require a submit button because the great majority of data is for viewing only. However, there is a grid Telerik MVC that displays comments. A user should be able to add a comment  in a textbox  and that comment should then appear in the grid. Because the comments data comes from two different database sources and are merged in a stored procedure, Im not able to use inline grid editing.p  pQuestion 1.p  pIs it poossible to asynchronously postback the just contents of the wrapping DIV  i.e. the textbox with the new comment  to a controller without a complete Form postback and page flickerp  pThanks,p  pArnold  p

It needs to compare its 32 type columns to the values in the types table if the main table column has an X for its value and insert the mainid and typesid into the linked table.p  pi have done a lot of searching, and it looks like a prepared statement would be the way to go, but i wanted to ask the experts.p  pThe issue, is i dont want to write 32 IF statements, and even if i did, i need to query the types table to get the ID for that type, seems like a huge waist of resources.p  pIdeally i want to do this inside of my triggerp  precodeBEGIN  DECLARE types resultsset  not sure if this is a valid type  iam sure my loop syntax is all wrong here...

Negative 78160 pWe have a WCF service that has two operations Operation1 and Operation2 with the same message contract.

I understand the resolution that is given in the error, but we want to have the same message for a number of different operations.p  pThoughtsp  pMore Info We implement an event pubsub mechanism. Event subscribers declare a service operation with the event type they want to handle and wrap that in a generic message contract class. This generic message class uses the message code attributes to use the eventpublisher xml names  which is a single message structure. All event subscribers are registered in UDDI and the pubsub mechanism use those endpoints to push events to the subscribers. Registration of service operations in UDDI detect the specific eventnamespace to register those service operations as event handlers and not reqresponse operations.p

Negative 78160 pIts rather a general, conceptual question, but Im developing a testquiz application at the moment, and want to p  pa be able to change the questions answers  orders whenever I wantp  pb save every completed test, complete with report, in the databasep  pIve built the back end in CI so there is a nice user friendly way to edit the questions, but Im trying to think of the best way to save the completed tests, without memory amp space wastage.p  pTrouble is, if I change the test questions, I dont want them to alter the archived saved results that people have taken in the past. So Im thinking I need to serialize every single question when someone takes a test, so that you can view the old report cards with legacy questions on them, even if those questions no longer exist.p  pThis seems bulky though, with 40 questions needing to be saved for every test someone takes. Anyone have a better ideap  pThanksp
Negative 78160 pIm trying to slice a list call this input list amp it contains Java double data type elements in multiple parts sub lists. The size of the sub lists can be unequal by a small number.  Each part sub list serves as an input to another program.

Negative 78160 pAfter a supportive answer of miamk, I am a step closer to achieving what I want.. But theres the following issue nowp  pI have an iPad application that can be used in all four view modes portrait updown and landscape leftright. But at a certain point I have a View that I only want to be seen in stronglandscapestrong mode. So I do the following in the UIViewController that will trigger the action to view the landscapeonly viewp  precode void showPropertyProperty  property      if [self interfaceOrientation]  UIInterfaceOrientationLandscapeLeft  [self interfaceOrientation]  UIInterfaceOrientationLandscapeRight          PropertyViewController propertyView  [[PropertyViewController alloc] initWithNibNamePropertyViewController bundle[NSBundle mainBundle]]         propertyView.property      property         [self.navigationController pushViewControllerpropertyView animatedYES]         [propertyView release]         propertyView  nil          else          RotateDeviceViewController rotateView  [[RotateDeviceViewController alloc] initWithNibNameTabRotate bundle [NSBundle mainBundle]]         rotateView.property  property         [self.navigationController pushViewControllerrotateView animatedYES]         [rotateView release]         rotateView  nil       codepre  pThis works fine and thus shows either the desired screen PropertyViewController when the iPad is held in landscape mode, and if not it shows the RotateDeviceViewController which shows the user a message that heshe is supposed to rotate the device to correctly view the screen.p  pSo that worksp  pThen the problem arises in this strongRotateDeviceViewControllerstrong.. There I have the followingp  precode BOOLshouldAutorotateToInterfaceOrientationUIInterfaceOrientationinterfaceOrientation      if UIInterfaceOrientationIsLandscapeinterfaceOrientation         [self showProperty]     return UIInterfaceOrientationIsPortraitinterfaceOrientation    void showProperty      PropertyViewController propertyView  [[PropertyViewController alloc] initWithNibNamePropertyViewController bundle[NSBundle mainBundle]]     propertyView.property      property     [self.navigationController pushViewControllerpropertyView animatedYES]     [propertyView release]  codepre  pSo as soon as I rotate the device when viewing the strongRotateDeviceViewControllerstrong to landscape mode I show the user the strongPropertyViewControllerstrong. This works... But when the strongPropertyViewControllerstrong appears it shows my layout 90 degrees rotated. So basically it shows the content in strongportraitstrong mode instead of using the stronglandscapestrong mode which is actually the way you are holding the device..p  pI hope this makes sense and someone can show me whats causing this.p

Negative 78160 pIn the process of implementing this feature and wanted to get some suggestions.p  pWhen a user lands on this one page on my site, I get the users connections from linkedin via an API call. Now I need to display these connections on my page 10 connections at a time for some further processing. After loading the first 10 initially I want to give the user an option to load 10 more connections by hitting a button, and then 10 more, etc. p  pI was thinking of implementing this in such a way that when user arrives on page, I make the API call, get all connections at one time, store them all into a JSON object and then display the first 10. If the user asks for the next 10, then I read the next 10 from the JSON object.p  pIs this the best way I can achieve this paging ability Is using a JSON object a good way of going about it Note, idea here is to prevent making muletiple API calls since Linkedin has a daily limit. Thanks.p

Negative 78160 pI am using some JGraphX components but this question can be applied to a general purpose of java. p  pI have a component inside of a JScrollPane. The issue I am having is that I have the ability to pan in the view by grabbing the view and moving it around like Google maps. but if the cursor leaves the viewport the scrolling changes directions. I have done some research and found the issue causing the problem. It can be found part of the way down on this page where it starts talking about how the scrollpane works. p  pa hrefhttpdownload.oracle.comjavasetutorialuiswingcomponentsscrollpane.html relnofollowhttpdownload.oracle.comjavasetutorialuiswingcomponentsscrollpane.htmlap  blockquote   pMove the cursor over the image and press the cursor. Continuing to   press the cursor, drag to a point outside the image and pause. The   visible area of the image moves toward the cursor. This   scrollbydragging functionality is enabled by the scroll pane, and   with the JComponent API, but it is implemented by the custom component   that displays the image.p blockquote  pIt has the little demo so you can see how it works as well as the code is available for download.p  pSo by default the scrollpane has a scroll to drag implemented but it is actually opposite of how I need mine to scroll. The JGraphX library I am using has extended most of the classes used to benefit itself in some way but the basic idea still applies. I really just need to know of the easiest way to disable this. Yhe page says its enabled by the scrollpane and the JComponent API, but what actually gets enabledp
Negative 78160 pIn TDD, you pick a test case and implement that test case then you write enough production code so that the test passes, refactor the codes and again you pick a new test case and the cycle continues.p  pThe problem I have with this process is that TDD says that you write enough code only to pass the test you just wrote. What I refer to exactly is that if a method can have e.g. 1 million test cases, what can you do Obviously not writing 1 million test casesp  pLet me explain what I mean more clearly by the below examplep  precode internal static Listltlonggt GetPrimeFactorsulong number                      var result  new Listltulonggt              while number  2  0                              result.Add2                 number  number  2                           var divisor  3              while divisor lt number                              if number  divisor  0                                      result.Adddivisor                     number  number  divisor                                  else                                      divisor  2                                            return result          codepre  pThe above code returns all the prime factors of a given number. ulong has 64 bits which means it can accept values between 0 to 18,446,744,073,709,551,615p  pSo, How TDD works when there can be millions of test cases for a production functionalityp  pI mean how many test cases suffice to be written so that I can say I used TDD to achieve this production codep  pThis concept in TDD which says that you should only write enough code to pass your test seems to be wrong to me as can be seen by the example abovep  pWhen enough is enoughp  pMy own thoughts are that I only pick some test cases e.g. for Upper band, lower band and few more e.g. 5 test cases but thats not TDD, is itp  pMany thanks for your thoughts on TDD for this example.p
Negative 78160 pI asked this before, but question wasnt formulated well.

Negative 78160 pIm running an imageheavy website hosted on Windows Azure. Backend performance is great but response times for image thumbnails, which make the bulk of page sizes, are quite volatile. Im using the a hrefhttpwww.windowsazure.comenushometourcdnAzure CDNa for serving all images but their response times vary by orders of magnitude and I havent found any pattern in the fast 150 milliseconds vs slow 34 seconds requests yet. This also doesnt seem to be a local phenomenon since Ive tested the load times from different locationscontinents. My conclusion so far is that the Azure CDN is simply not that good after all and I started looking for other ways to improve the load times of static assets.p  pNow that the context is clear, here is my actual question does anyone have experience with services like a hrefhttpwww.cloudflare.comCloudflarea and a hrefhttpwww.incapsula.comIncapsulaa for improving the performance of websites hosted on cloud infrastructure like Windows Azure These services promise reduced server load among other things, but Im more interested if they are actually effective in reducing response times for static files, as well as any negative impact on dynamic page content.

Negative 78160 pI am about to segregate my MVC3 app into areas, but some controllers and views are common to multiple areas. How can I share these p  pI have considered some options here, but would rather take some advice first. I can locate shared controllersviews in the core app, i.e. no in any area, and route and or redirect to actions on these controllers. I can also place controllers in a shared library, and use derived controllers in my areas. Then, similar to my first option, I can use custom controller factories in my areas and use these to target shared controllers in the core app.p  pHow should I go about thisp

Negative 78160 pI have an existing python3 installation in Windows, but things arent really configured right.  The main problem comes down to installing new packages.  I am behind an authenticating proxy and the way I install packages is by manually downloading them and running codepython setup.py installcode.  This works fine for some packages, but then there are some which use easyinstall to automatically download dependencies, and these get stuck at the proxy, so I have to find all the dependencies and manually download and install them.  This also makes it really difficult to track my own dependencies.p  pIn the next few weeks my computer will be reinstalled, so when that happens I would like to get a much better setup working.

Negative 78160 pWe have a long piece of video, up to 1 hour long.  We want to show users small 30 second chunks of this video. Its imperative that the video does not stutter at any point.p  pThe user emcantem then jump around the rest of the video, they only see the 30 second chunk.p  pAn example would be say, a football match, the whole match is on video but clicking a button in another page would load up the full video and play just a goal.p  pIs this possible with HTML5 Video  Would it have anything to do with TimeRanges Does the video have to served over a pure streaming protocol  Can we buffer the full 30 second chunk before playing itp  pThe goal is to cut down on the workflow required to cut out all the little clips and the time transcoding these to all the different HTML 5 video formats, we can just throw up a transcoded piece of footage and send the user to a section of that footage.p  pYour thoughts and input are most welcome, thanksp

Negative 78160 pIn section 3.5.4.2 of a hrefhttptools.ietf.orghtmlrfc5104section3.5.4.2 relnofollowRFC5104a, an algorithm to derive the bounding set of a set of lines is derived. Basically each line is of the form ymxb, and the objective is to find the points of intersections that identify the convex hull equivalent to determine which receivers are relevant for bitrate adaptation in RTP media sessions. The following observation is taken from the RFC  p  blockquote   pThese observations lead to the conclusion that when processing the    TMMBR tuples to select the initial bounding set, one should sort andbr   process the tuples by order of increasing overhead.  Once abr   particular tuple has been added to the bounding set, all tuples notbr   already selected and having lower overhead can be eliminated, because    the next side of the bounding polygon has to be steeper i.e., thebr   corresponding TMMBR must have higher overhead than the latest addedbr   tuple.  p blockquote  pI dont think this is correct. Assume you have a line, such as the one indicated in Figure 1 of the RFC with symbol a. It is possible to draw a line with larger slope, such as the line indicated with symbol b that starts on the Yaxis below line a. In other words, if line b has lower intercept on the Yaxis, you should consider line b first. But if this is true, the rest of the algorithm does not work.p

Negative 78160 pI am a huge newbie and I have a program that normally prints items to the Java console window. I would like this program to become a window in which the user can interact with. The reason why I have not resorted to dialog boxes and panels is because this program require multiple prints to the console window. A traditional dialog box does not continuously update or compound on data that has already been printed on the box. I realize that there is another way of doing this by creating a program that mimics the Java console window. Because I am a noob, all of the java console redirecting questions and answers on this site have blown over my head. Can anyone please help mep

Negative 78160 pI am animating three views that are stacked on top of each other. When I tap one that is not the front view, one or two views will slide up or down to uncover the tapped view, bring the tapped view to front, and then return everything to their original position. Most of these work fine. Only when I bring a view to front that I just animated away I get a noticeable flicker.p  pI have read at least a hundred posts but none contains the solution. I am posting this to consolidate every suggested solution in one place and to hopefully find a solution.p  pI know that the animation does not animate the view itself, but just an image. The view stays at its original position. It is definitely related to that. It only happens when bringing a view to front that just moved.p  pMoving the view to the animation end position before starting the animation or after the animation is finished does not help one bit.p  pIt also is not related to the codeAnimationListener.onAnimationEndcode bug, since I derived my own views and intercept codeonAnimationEndcode there.p  pI am using codeAnimation.setFillAftercode and codeAnimation.setFillEnabledcode to keep the final image at the animation end location.p  pI tried using codeAnimation.setZAdjustmentcode but that one only works for entire screens, not views within a screen.p  pFrom what I have learned I suspect that the problem is codebringToFrontcode itself, which does a coderemoveChildaddChildcode on the parent view. Maybe the coderemoveChildcode causes the redraw showing the view without the removed child briefly.p  pstrongSo my questionsstrong Does anyone see anything I missed that could fix this Does emAndroidem maybe have a command to temporarily stop drawing and resume drawing later. Something like a codesetUpdateScreenfalse  setUpdateScreentruecode pair That would allow me to skip the emflickerem stage.p  pMinimal code to demo the effect follows. Tap white to see red move up and back down behind white without emflickerem white comes to front but does not move. Then tap red to see red move back up from behind white and the flicker when it is brought to front just before it slides back down over white. Weird thing is that the same thing does not always happen when using blue instead of red.p  pemstrongMainActivity.javaemstrongp  precodepackage com.example.testapp  import com.example.testapp.ImagePanel.AnimationEndListener import android.app.Activity import android.os.Bundle import android.view.View import android.view.animation.TranslateAnimation  public class MainActivity extends Activity    private static final int ANIMATIONTIME  1000    private ImagePanel mRed   private ImagePanel mWhite   private ImagePanel mBlue   private int mFrontPanelId    private void animatefinal ImagePanel panel, final int yFrom, final int yTo,       final AnimationEndListener animationListener        final TranslateAnimation anim  new TranslateAnimation0, 0, 0, 0, 0, yFrom, 0, yTo     anim.setDurationANIMATIONTIME     anim.setFillAftertrue     anim.setFillEnabledtrue     if animationListener  null            panel.setAnimListeneranimationListener          panel.startAnimationanim       public void onClickfinal View v        final int panelId  v.getId     if mFrontPanelId  panelId            return          final ImagePanel panel  ImagePanel v      final int yTop  mWhite.getTop  mRed.getBottom     final int yBot  mWhite.getBottom  mBlue.getTop      final boolean moveRed  panelId  R.id.red  mFrontPanelId  R.id.red     final boolean moveBlue  panelId  R.id.blue  mFrontPanelId  R.id.blue      animatemBlue, 0, moveBlue  yBot  0, null     animatemRed, 0, moveRed  yTop  0, new AnimationEndListener            public void onBegin                      public void onEnd                 make sure middle panel always stays visible         if moveRed ampamp moveBlue                    mWhite.bringToFront                   panel.bringToFront          animatemBlue, moveBlue  yBot  0, 0, null         animatemRed, moveRed  yTop  0, 0, new AnimationEndListener                    public void onBegin                                  public void onEnd                                         mFrontPanelId  panelId                   Override   public void onCreatefinal Bundle savedInstanceState        super.onCreatesavedInstanceState     setContentViewR.layout.activitymain      mRed  ImagePanel findViewByIdR.id.red     mWhite  ImagePanel findViewByIdR.id.white     mBlue  ImagePanel findViewByIdR.id.blue     mFrontPanelId  R.id.red     codepre  pemstrongImagePanel.javaemstrongp  precodepackage com.example.testapp  import android.content.Context import android.util.AttributeSet import android.widget.ImageView  public class ImagePanel extends ImageView    public interface AnimationEndListener        public void onBegin      public void onEnd       private AnimationEndListener mAnim  null    public ImagePanelfinal Context context        supercontext       public ImagePanelfinal Context context, final AttributeSet attrs        supercontext, attrs       public ImagePanelfinal Context context, final AttributeSet attrs, final int defStyle        supercontext, attrs, defStyle       Override   protected void onAnimationEnd        super.onAnimationEnd     clearAnimation     if mAnim  null            final AnimationEndListener anim  mAnim       mAnim  null       anim.onEnd            Override   protected void onAnimationStart        super.onAnimationStart     if mAnim  null            mAnim.onBegin            public void setAnimListenerfinal AnimationEndListener anim        mAnim  anim     codepre  pstrongactivitymain.xmlstrongp  precodeltxml version1.0 encodingutf8gt ltRelativeLayout xmlnsandroidhttpschemas.android.comapkresandroid     androidididmain     androidlayoutwidthfillparent     androidlayoutheightfillparent gt      ltcom.example.testapp.ImagePanel         androidididblue         androidlayoutwidth300dp         androidlayoutheight300dp         androidlayoutalignParentBottomtrue         androidlayoutcenterHorizontaltrue         androidbackground000080         androidsrcdrawabletestpattern         androidonClickonClick gt      ltcom.example.testapp.ImagePanel         androidididwhite         androidlayoutwidth300dp         androidlayoutheight300dp         androidlayoutcenterHorizontaltrue         androidlayoutcenterVerticaltrue         androidbackground808080         androidsrcdrawabletestpattern         androidonClickonClick gt      ltcom.example.testapp.ImagePanel         androidididred         androidlayoutwidth300dp         androidlayoutheight300dp         androidlayoutalignParentToptrue         androidlayoutcenterHorizontaltrue         androidadjustViewBoundstrue         androidbackground800000         androidsrcdrawabletestpattern         androidonClickonClick gt  ltRelativeLayoutgt codepre  pemstrongtestpattern.xmlemstrongp  precodeltxml version1.0 encodingutf8gt ltshape xmlnsandroidhttpschemas.android.comapkresandroid     androidshapeoval gt      ltgradient          androidstartColor00000000         androidendColorffffffff gt  ltshapegt codepre

Negative 78160 pSo Ive been having this issue where when I try to get the Metadata and Artifact repository managers from the provisioning agents using thisp  precodeServiceReferenceltgt sr  Activator.getContext.getServiceReferenceIProvisioningAgentProvider.SERVICENAME IProvisioningAgentProvider agentProvider  null  if sr  nullreturn  agentProvider  IProvisioningAgentProvider Activator.getContext.getServicesr final IProvisioningAgent agent  agentProvider.createAgentnew URIsome place IMetadataRepositoryManager manager  IMetadataRepositoryManager agent.getServiceIMetadataRepositoryManager.SERVICENAME IArtifactRepositoryManager artifactManager  IArtifactRepositoryManager agent.getServiceIArtifactRepositoryManager.SERVICENAME codepre  pWhich works fine if the services for those have already been started.  However, a lot of times the artifact manager comes back null because its service doesnt exist yet.  Ive been able to hack around it by setting the start level of the bundle that contains the above code to 5, so all the services are started before I try to get their service references. p  pI really dont want to screw around with start levels. What Id like to do is use declarative services to set these various components and therefore delay start of my service.  The only problem is that I dont know what services to reference so I can put them in my component.xml file.  Is this even possible in eclipse 3.7.2p

Negative 78160 pI have a table which stores highscores for a game. This game has many levels where scores are then ordered by score DESC which is an index where the level is a level ID. Would partitioning on this level ID column create the same result as create many seperate level tables one for each level ID I need this to seperate out the level data somehow as Im expecting 10s of millions of entries. I hear partitioning could speed this process up, whilst leaving my tables normalised.p  pAlso, I have an unknown amount of levels in my game levels may be added or removed at any time. Can I specify to partition on this level ID column and have new partitions automaticaly get created when a new distinct level ID is added to the highscore table I may start with 10 seperate levels but end up with 50, but all my data is still kept in one table, but many partitions Do I have to index the level ID to make this workp  pThanks in advance for your advicep

Each script, before outputting checks if mydir exists and if not creates itp  precodeif not os.path.isdirmydir     os.makedirsmydir codepre  pbut this yields the errorp  precodeos.makedirsself.logdir                                                File usrlibpython2.6os.py, line 157, in makedirs mkdirname,mode OSError [Errno 17] File exists codepre  pI suspect it might be due to a race condition, where one job creates the dir before the other gets to it. Is this possible If so, how can this error be avoided Im not sure its a race condition so was wondering if other issues in Python can cause this odd error.p

Negative 78160 pIm working in Java and have come across an incredibly odd error.  I have a very basic class as followsp  precodepublic class ClassA    private static Logger log  Logger.getLoggerClassA.class.getName    private boolean trace     public ClassA       trace  log.isTraceEnabled         public void doSomething       does stuff      codepre  pI can use this class just fine within my current project.  However, when I build, package, and install to my local repo using Maven, no remote artifact repo set up, other projects cannot properly use this  class because they cannot instantiate it.  When I try anything likep  precodeClassA classA  new ClassA codepre  pI get the following compilation errorp  precodeClassA has private access in [package].ClassA codepre  pIve decompiled the .jar in my local repo to ensure the constructor is present and is public  it is.  Ive also used the U flag to force updates and the compilation continues to fail.  What could be causing this errorp

Negative 78160 pSo, I am using 2D arrays for a platformer physics system Im working on. Unfortunately, the 2D arrays require generic types for various reasons.p  pIm dynamically building the surfaces with some java Collections linkedlist to be precise and then converting them to 2D arrays with some hacky trickery. This currently works, giving me the appropriate 2D generic array p  precodeLinkedListltPhysSurfaceltPgtgt leftSurfaces  new LinkedListltPhysSurfaceltPgtgt LinkedListltPhysSurfaceltPgtgt rightSurfaces  new LinkedListltPhysSurfaceltPgtgt LinkedListltPhysSurfaceltPgtgt topSurfaces  new LinkedListltPhysSurfaceltPgtgt LinkedListltPhysSurfaceltPgtgt bottomSurfaces  new LinkedListltPhysSurfaceltPgtgt   Add surfaces to the lists  GenericArrayltPhysSurfaceltPgt[]gt base  new GenericArrayltPhysSurfaceltPgt[]gt4 PhysSurfaceltPgt[][] surfaces  base.elements surfaces[0]  leftSurfaces.toArraynew GenericArrayltPhysSurfaceltPgtgt.elements surfaces[1]  rightSurfaces.toArraynew GenericArrayltPhysSurfaceltPgtgt.elements surfaces[2]  topSurfaces.toArraynew GenericArrayltPhysSurfaceltPgtgt.elements surfaces[3]  bottomSurfaces.toArraynew GenericArrayltPhysSurfaceltPgtgt.elements codepre  pHowever, when I try to put this all into a generic, static method like thisp  precodeSuppressWarningsunchecked public static ltTgt T[][] to2DArrayCollectionltTgt... collections      GenericArrayltT[]gt base  new GenericArrayltT[]gtcollections.length     T[][] array  base.elements     forint i  0 i lt collections.length i         array[i]  collections[i].toArraynew GenericArrayltTgt.elements     return array  codepre  pAnd then I call the method like thisp  precodePhysSurfaceltPgt[][] surfaces  GenericsUtils.to2DArrayleftSurfaces, rightSurfaces, topSurfaces, bottomSurfaces codepre  pThen everything crashes, giving me a ClassCastException, saying that it cannot convert type Object to type PhysSurface. The stack trace is herep  precodeException in thread main java.lang.ClassCastException [[Ljava.lang.Object cannot be cast to [[Lcom.meg.utils.2D.platformer.phys.environment.surface.PhysSurface     at com.meg.chaostemple.test.world.PhysTestWorldTestMap.ltinitgtPhysTestWorld.java487     at com.meg.chaostemple.test.world.PhysTestWorldTestPlayer.ltinitgtPhysTestWorld.java245     at com.meg.chaostemple.test.world.PhysTestWorld.ltinitgtPhysTestWorld.java95     at com.meg.chaostemple.main.ChaosDebug.createWorldChaosDebug.java72     at com.meg.jrabbit.engine.main.BaseGame.startBaseGame.java56     at com.meg.jrabbit.engine.loop.Loop.runLoop.java44     at com.meg.jrabbit.engine.main.BaseGame.runBaseGame.java40     at com.meg.jrabbit.engine.main.StandardGame.runStandardGame.java85     at com.meg.chaostemple.main.ChaosDebug.mainChaosDebug.java19 codepre  pAs far as I can tell, the generic method is not using the generic type T, but instead defaulting to creating a Object[][] and attempting to cast up when it returns. If this is whats happening, why does this not work when put into a static method And if not, what the heck is going onp  hr   ul liGenericArray is a custom class that uses variablelength arguments to get around the usual barriers to making generic arrays and then wraps the result. The actual constructor is GenericArrayT... elements.li ul

Negative 78160 pI would like to parallelize the application that processes multiple video clips frame by frame. Sequence of each frame per clip is important obviously. I decided to go with TPL Dataflow since I believe this is a good example of dataflow movie frames being data.p  pSo I have one process that loads frames from database lets say in a batch of 500, all bunched upp  precodeExample sequence     mid1 fr1mid1 fr2mid2 fr1mid3 fr1mid1 fr3mid2 fr2mid2 fr3mid1 fr4 codepre  pand posts them to BufferBlock. To this BufferBlock I have linked ActionBlocks with the filter to have one ActionBlock per MovieID so that I get some kind of data partitioning. Each ActionBlock is sequential, but ideally multiple ActionBlocks for multiple movies can run in parallel.p  pI do have the above described network working and it does run in parallel, but from my calculations only eight to ten ActionBlocks are executing simultaneously. I timed each ActionBlocks running time and its around 100200ms. What steps can I take to at least double concurrencyp  pI did try converting action delegates to async methods and make database access asynchronous within ActionBlock action delegate but it did not help.p  pstrongEDITstrong I implemented extra level of data partitioning frames for Movies with Odd IDs are processed on ServerA, frames for Even movies are processed on ServerB. Both instances of the application hit the same database. If my problem was DB IO, then I would not see any improvement in total frames processed count or very little, under 20. But I do see it doubling. So this leads me to conclude that Threadpool is not spawning more threads to do more frames in parallel both servers are quadcores and profiler shows about 2530 threads per application.p

The expectation is to have the data that currently plots in the code the stream column on the same SVG with the data that doesnt graph the Avgstream and Avgstream columns. However, in each D3.js project Ive done, Ive never been able to put straight lines on the graph. In this graph at the moment, only the stream column plots. Its my attempt at an easy way to show that the results of stream are inside or outside of the running average of the data Im using.p  pAny ideas on why these lines wont plotp

Negative 78160 pI have just run across an issue where setting coderesponse.headers[ContentLength]code in a Rails 3.2.2 application causes Nginx to throw a 502 Bad Gateway error.p  pI have an action in a controller that uses the codesenddatacode method to send raw JPEG data contained within a variable.  Before, I had a problem with some browsers not downloading the entire image being sent and discovered that no ContentLength header is being sent, so I decided to use the code.bytesizecode property of the variable containing the JPEG data as the ContentLength.p  pThis works fine in development using Unicorn and there is now a ContentLength header where there wasnt one before, but in production where Im using Nginx and Passenger, I get the aforementioned 502 Bad Gateway.  Also, in the Nginx error log, I seep  precode[error] 305740 1686 upstream prematurely closed connection while reading response header from upstream codepre  pThere are no matching entries in the Rails production log, which tells me the application is fine.p  pIve commented out the line where I set the ContentLength header, and the problem went away.  Im still testing whether I actually need to send a ContentLength header, but meanwhile, I thought I might post this out of curiosity to see if anyone has any thoughts.p

Negative 78160 pHow are texture coordinates interpolated in a GLSL shaderp  pIm trying to downsample an image from screen size to 14 its original size.  This is a pretty simple procedure but it doesnt seem to be correct.  I have an FBO, with a single colour attachment to use as a target that is 14 screen size.p  pIn order to downsample the texture, I have a simple fullsize quad that Im going to draw, where coordinates are as followsp  precodev[0].v.position.x  1.f v[0].v.position.y  1.f v[0].v.position.z  0.f v[1].v.position.x  1.f v[1].v.position.y   1.f v[1].v.position.z  0.f v[2].v.position.x   1.f v[2].v.position.y  1.f v[2].v.position.z  0.f v[3].v.position.x   1.f v[3].v.position.y   1.f v[3].v.position.z  0.f codepre  pNow, my vertex shader simply scales and biases the input coordinates in order to generate texture coordinates, passing through the vertices without need to transform them and without the need for me to pass texture coordinates in with the geometry, as followsp  precodeversion 420  layoutlocation  0 in vec3 attribPosition  out vec2 attribFragmentTexture  void main      attribFragmentTexture  attribPosition.xy  0.5  0.5       glPosition  vec4attribPosition.xy, 0.0, 1.0  codepre  pSo the texture coordinates output as attribFragmentTexture will go from 0.0 to 1.0 as the vertex coordinates go from 1 to 1.  A little test of this with the following shader however, seems to show that uv.x and uv.y only go from 0.0 to 0.25.  I expected them to interpolate from 0.0 to 1.0p  precodeversion 420  in vec2 attribFragmentTexture  out vec4 OutColour  void mainvoid      vec2 uv  attribFragmentTexture.xy      OutColour  vec4uv.x, uv.y, 1.0, 1.0  codepre  pCan anyone spot what my obviously simple mistakemisunderstanding might be  p

Negative 78160 pMy WHMCS installation suddenly stopped working two days ago.

I created a test file and confirmed it an issue with PHP sessions.

I read somehwere that the session.savepath folder should NOT be under the user control of root mine is. What should I set it to I have no other users.

Negative 78160 pI have went through a myriad of resources including, but not limited to, a hrefhttpsgroups.google.comforummsgandroidopencvLIixgriYSscEZWqxp5O3QJ relnofollowOpenCV4Androids Google groupa, StackOverflow and a hrefhttpanswers.opencv.orgquestion2658staticinitializationproblem relnofollowOpenCVs answersa page trying to resolve this, reaching a point where suggestions become redundant. The problem may be more or less similar to a previous yet to be resolved a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions14588578opencvusingandroidndkcouldnotberesolvederrorquestiona of mine, but a different situation and thus perhaps a different source of error. p  pI have added an Android Activity to a package containing a successfullyrunning app OpenCVs tutorial 3 sample demonstrating ndk use. The activity uses OpenCVs java API, but there is a call to codeSystem.loadLibrarynativefilecode where codenativefilecode represents a native library. The block where the codeloadLibrarycode is called is mentioned below it is in the codeonManagerConnectedcode method. At the codeloadLibrarycode line, Logcat emitsp  precode0217 192739.239 EAndroidRuntime10872 FATAL EXCEPTION main 0217 192739.239 EAndroidRuntime10872 java.lang.UnsatisfiedLinkError Library nativefile not found 0217 192739.239 EAndroidRuntime10872    at java.lang.Runtime.loadLibraryRuntime.java461 0217 192739.239 EAndroidRuntime10872    at java.lang.System.loadLibrarySystem.java557 codepre  pSuch error indeed did occur multiple times in other questions and I have tried the suggestions I came across. However, there is a noteworthy observation to this problem the app that successfully runs the OpenCV sample calls the same library through codeSystem.loadLibrarynativefilecode. p  pThe code is rather long and thus not helpful to place in the question. However below summarises what I presume are key elements regarding the problem, it also summarises some of the previous answers related to the matter.p  ul liThe .cpp file called has the correct method name, where I verify that it includes the package name and the class name, as well as the method name, in a pattern similar to codeJavapackageNameSeperatedWithUnderScorescallingClassNamemethodNamecode. Morever the code is surrounded within an codeextern Ccode block, as with other OpenCV sample cpp files for native development.li liThe Android manifest is updated to learn that it launches the activity in question.li lipBelow is the codeAndroid.mkcode filep  pcodeLOCALPATH  call mydir include CLEARVARSbr include ....sdknativejniOpenCV.mk LOCALMODULE     nativefilebr LOCALSRCFILES  nativefile.cppbr LOCALLDLIBS   llog ldlbr include BUILDSHAREDLIBRARYcodepli lipBelow is the codeApplication.mkcode filep  pcodeAPPSTL  gnustlstaticbr APPCPPFLAGS  frtti fexceptionsbr APPABI  allcode  pli lipI have tried replacing codeallcode in the codeAPPABIcode line with codearmeabicode and also again tried with codearmeabiv7acode, no different results however. pli liIve also verified, as suggested in a comment a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions13385265ndklibrarynotfoundherea, that the apk after being extracted contains the needed code.socode file in codelibcode folder under the various architecture type folders.li lipBelow is the codeBaseLoaderCallBackcode instantiation block, not much unlike that in the OpenCV sample, however I do not call the OpenCV camera, since the app performs image processing on images read from the SD card.p  precode BaseLoaderCallback loader  new BaseLoaderCallbackthis  public void onManagerConnectedint status       switchstatus              case LoaderCallbackInterface.SUCCESS               System.loadLibrarynativefile break            default                super.onManagerConnectedstatus break           codepreli lipUnlike OpenCVs sample however, in the Activity in question the line codeloader.onManagerConnectedLoaderCallbackInterface.SUCCESScode is added to the codeonCreatecode method, since the method codeonManagerConnectedcode didnt seem to be called otherwise. pli liBefore every OpenCV block of statements, the condition codeif OpenCVLoader.initDebugcode is checked. Ive also tried the a hrefhttpdocs.opencv.orgtrunkandroidservicedocJavaHelper.html relnofollowrecommendeda  codeOpenCVLoader.initAsyncOpenCVLoader.OPENCVVERSION243, this, loadercode conditional check, but still no different results.li liAlso, the ndkbuild runs successfully building the code.socode files for the native library codenativefilecode.li ul  pGiven that the other activity, within the same package, load the library and utilises it finely of course after amending the manifest file and cpp method name accordingly, I presume the project properties are correct such as adding OpenCV library, and necessary environment paths, etc. p  pI reviewed the OpenCV sample multiple times and followed the same practice with slight variances, as detailed above. p  pAny ideas what could be the source of the problem   p  pThank you for your time.p

Negative 78160 pI run a php script that uses the wikipedia api to locate wikipedia pages about certain movies, based on a long list with titles and year of release. This takes 12 seconds per query on average, and I do about 5 queries per minute. This has been working well for years. But since february 11 it suddenly became very slow  30 seconds per query seems the norm now. p  pThis is a example from a random movie in my list, and the link my script loads with filegetcontentsp  pa hrefhttpen.wikipedia.orgwapi.phpactionqueryampproprevisionsamprvpropcontentampformatyamlamprvsection0amptitlesDeceiver28film29 relnofollowhttpen.wikipedia.orgwapi.phpactionqueryampproprevisionsamprvpropcontentampformatyamlamprvsection0amptitlesDeceiverfilmap  pI can put this link in my browser directly and it takes no more than a few seconds to load and open it. So I dont think the wikipedia api servers have suddenly become slow. When I load the link to my php script from my webserver in my browser, it takes between 20 to 40 seconds before the page is loaded and the result from one query is shown. When I run the php script from the command line of my webserver, I have the same slow loading times. My script still manage to save some results to the database now and then, so Im probably not blocked either. p  pOther parts of my php scripts have not slowed down. There is a whole bunch of calculations done with the results of the wikipedia api, and all that is still working at a regular speed. So my webserver is still healthy. The load is always pretty low, and Im not even using this server for something else. I have restarted apache, but found no difference in loading times.p  pMy questions p  ul liphas something changed in the wikipedia api system recently  Perhaps my way of using it is outdated and I need to use something new pli lipwhere could I look for the cause of this slow loading  Ive dug through error files and tested what I could test, but I dont even know where something goes wrong. If I knew what to look for, I might perhaps easily fix it.pli ul

I thought i could implement this by putting in a BroadCastReceiver with action name android.net.wifi.WIFISTATECHANGED and i assumed, whenever a new network is available, the broadcast receiver will be notified and i could check the SSID to see if i have arrived home.p  pManifest filep  precodeltxml version1.0 encodingutf8gt ltmanifest xmlnsandroidhttpschemas.android.comapkresandroid packagecom.example.myfirstapp androidversionCode1 androidversionName1.0 gt  ltusessdk androidminSdkVersion8 androidtargetSdkVersion17 gt  ltusespermission androidnameandroid.permission.ACCESSWIFISTATE gt ltusespermission androidnameandroid.permission.CHANGEWIFISTATE gt  ltapplication     androidallowBackuptrue     androidicondrawableiclauncher     androidlabelstringappname     androidthemestyleAppTheme gt     ltactivity         androidnamecom.example.myfirstapp.MainActivity         androidlabelstringappname gt         ltintentfiltergt             ltaction androidnameandroid.intent.action.MAIN gt             ltcategory androidnameandroid.intent.category.LAUNCHER gt         ltintentfiltergt     ltactivitygt     ltreceiver         androidnamecom.example.myfirstapp.WifiNetworksAvailableBroadcastReceiver         androidenabledtrue gt         ltintentfiltergt             ltaction androidnameandroid.net.wifi.WIFISTATECHANGED gt         ltintentfiltergt     ltreceivergt      ltactivity         androidnamecom.example.myfirstapp.WifiTester         androidlabelstringtitleactivitywifitester gt     ltactivitygt ltapplicationgt  ltmanifestgt codepre  pMy WifiNetworksAvailableBroadcastReceiver looks likep  precodepublic class WifiNetworksAvailableBroadcastReceiver extends BroadcastReceiver   protected static final String TAG  MyApp  Override public void onReceiveContext context, Intent intent                   WifiManager mMgr  WifiManager context.getSystemServiceContext.WIFISERVICE     Log.iTAG,      forfinal ScanResult resultmMgr.getScanResults          ifresult.SSID.equalsltMYHOMEWIFISSIDgt              Toast.makeTextcontext, Welcome home, Toast.LENGTHLONG.show                               Log.iTAG,     codepre  pNow with the app installed.

Negative 78160 pFor a website it is possible to include multiple iFrames for integration of external content.

Negative 78160 pIn order to keep my mobile web app lean and efficient, Im trying to limit the number of elements on the DOM at any given time. One way in which I intend to limit the use of DOM elements, is by using the pseudo codebeforecode and codeaftercode elements to generate content where possible.p  pFor example, rather than representing a listitem with metadata like thisbrp  precodeltdd classitemgt     ltdiv classnamegtNameltdivgt     ltdiv classdescgtDescriptionltdivgt     ltdiv classlocationgtLocationltdivgt     ltdiv classgenregtGenreltdivgt ltddgt codepre  pI could represent it like this amp use the codecontentcode property to display the metadatabrp  precodeltdd classchild      datanameName      datadescDescription      datalocationLocation      datagenreGenregt ltddgt codepre  pSo, one DOM element with data attributes as opposed to 5 separate elements and arguably cleaner markup.br Demo here a hrefhttpjsfiddle.netquc8b2 relnofollowhttpjsfiddle.netquc8b2abrp  pWill this technique actually improve performance My thought is that with fewer DOM elements javascript should parse faster and I should be able to addremove the listitem nodes faster. But will rendering i.e. painting, layout, amp reflows occur faster In other words, is CSS generated content renderedparsed faster or more efficiently than traditional elements and text nodesp  pHow browsers internally handle CSS generated content in the render tree and document tree  is an unknown to me shadow DOM maybe.

Negative 78160 pI need to implement feeds arbitration for a hrefhttpwww.fixprotocol.orgfast relnofollowFASTa protocol. Problem is pretty common and there are even a hrefhttpwww.accelize.comproductsfpgaplatformcomponentsfinanceipmarketdatadecoders.html relnofollowhardware solutionsa As problem is wide known i do think there should be at least general suggestions of how to implement that how many queries should I use, how many ringbuffers, how many readers, when to drop packets etc. and probably someone can point me to some implementation. For those who not familar with FAST I add some descriptionp  hr  pData in all UDP Feeds are disseminated in two identical feeds A and B on two different multicast IPs. It is strongly recommended that client receive and process both feeds because of possible UDP packet loss. Processing two identical feeds allows one to statistically decrease the probability of packet loss. It is not specified in what particular feed A or B the message appears for the first time. To arbitrate these feeds one should use the message sequence number found in Preamble or in tag 34MsgSeqNum. Utilization of the Preamble allows one to determine message sequence number without decoding of FAST message. Processing messages from feeds A and B should be performed using the following algorithmp  ol liListen feeds A and Bli liProcess messages according to their sequence numbers.li lipIgnore a message if one with the same sequence number was already processed before.p  p tcp recover algorithm furtherpli ol  hr  pSo I think that solution should be like thatp  ol lipFor each of two feed create dedicated thread and dedicated buffer. Add data to buffer as data arrives. should it be ringbuffer or queue or whatpli lipCreate reader which spin and checks both thread for the last available sequence number. As soon as sequence number is available next packet need to be processed and both threads should drop it after that.pli ol  pAny suggestions of how to implement algorithm itself and probably suggestion which structures to use are welcome. In particular probably someone can suggest lockfree queue  ringbuffer implementation.p

Negative 78160 pIm trying to manage a few App Engine applications and projects.   Im confused by the terminology.  All of my applications appear in Google App Engine application dashboard [0], and some but not all appear in the Google API console [1].  Whats the relationship between these two consoles  Whats the difference between an application in [0] vs a project in [1].  Why does the billing information seem consistent across bothp  pMy current best guess an App Engine application is one layer below an API console project.  To connect an application with a console project, you a create an API project [2] and then b configure your App Engine application to use it [3].  Is that right  If so, why andor how is billing information shared across projects and applications  Does a project inherit an applications billing informationp  pAny guidance appreciated  Thanksp  precode[0] appengine.google.com [1] code.google.comapisconsole [2] developers.google.comconsolehelpcreatingdeletingprojects [3] httpsdevelopers.google.comapiclientlibrarypythonguidegoogleappengine codepre

Negative 78160 pHi I have a server communicating with clients over UDP. Basically clients streams to the server UDP packets. Each packet consist from header and payload. in header, there is only one short int  i call it seqnum, running from 0 to SHORTMAX. When client reaches SHORTMAX on sending, it starts again from 0. p  pOn the server I need to reconstruct stream in this way p  pa If packet arrives with expected seqnum append to the stream.p  pb If packet arrives with lower than expected seqnum  drop it  it is packet which arrived to latep  pc If packet arrives with higher seqnum than expected  consider packets between expected and actual seqnum as lost and try to reconstruct them and after that append actual packetp  pI am dealing now with two problems connected to overflow of counterp  p1 how to detect situation c on SHORTMAX boundary e.g. expected is SHORTMAX2, actual seqnum in packet is 2  in my scenario it would be wrongly detected as situation bp  p2 same problem with situation b wrongly detected as cp  pThx a lotp

Negative 78160 pThis is primarily a PHP answer, but the methodology may in fact be language agnostic.p  pAfter running a CSV file through a simple parser, I was given a multidimensional array that resembled something akin to thisp  precodearray estimated gt   array      array TITLE gt MAIN, CURRPERF gt 100, POTPERF gt 75 ,     array TITLE gt HEAT, CURRPERF gt 90, POTPERF gt 60 ,     array TITLE gt CO2, CURRPERF gt 56, POTPERF gt 40 ,   ,   actual gt     array     array TITLE gt MAIN, CURRPERF gt 100, POTPERF gt 75 ,     array TITLE gt HEAT, CURRPERF gt 89 , POTPERF gt 75,     array TITLE gt CO2, CURRPERF gt 40, POTPERF gt 20 ,      codepre  pNow, horrific data structure to one side, without refactoring of the underlying parser  how would be the best way to ensure that you can access these in a specific order strongWithout necessarily touching the underlying parserstrongp  pIf you loop through using a codeforcodecodeforeachcode loop youre only going to be able to read them in a linear order  increasing or decreasing down the elements. Youre not necessarily going to be able to drill down and get the specific value required.p  pFor instance, the CSV file could express the values for codeestimatedcode in a different order to the values for codeactualcode and it may be required that they are output in yet another order.p  pFor example, here are three different orders off the top of my headp  precodegt MAIN HEAT CO2 gt HEAT MAIN CO2 gt CO2  HEAT MAIN codepre  pFurthermore, as is quite usual, the label names in the CSV file are not exactly userfriendly  so they need to be emtranslatedem if you like in to something more humanfriendly. Naturally, without the use of lots of codeifcode statements if preferablep  pGiven its a very specific use case, but its something Ive seen before with regards to arrays being serialised  and often finding out that they are actually nested.p  pIve posted one possible solution, but would be happy to see others. In the past when Ive done similar Ive never accepted my own answer  Im sure there must be a more elegant way than the one Ive devised..p

Negative 78160 pI am hosting a mongodb database for a service that supports full text searching on a collection with 6.8 million records.p  pIts text index includes ten fields with varying weights.p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comgdizi.png altindex specificationp  pMost searches take less than a second. Some searches take two to three seconds. However, some searches take 15  60 seconds The 1560 second search cases are unacceptable for my application. I need to find a way to speed those up.p  pSearching takes 1560 seconds when words that are very common in the index are used in the search query. p  pI seems that the text search feature does not support lazy parameters. My first thought was to cache a list of the 50 most common words in my text index and then ask mongodb to evaluate those last lazy and on top of the filtered results returned by the less common parameters. Hopefully people are still with me. For example, say I have a query products chocolate, where products is common and chocolate is uncommon. I would like to be able to ask mongodb to evaluate chocolate first, and then filter those results with the products term. Does anyone know of a way to achieve thisp  pI can achieve the above scenario by omitting the most common words i.e. products from the db query and then reapplying the common term filter on the application side after it has received records found by db. It is preferable for all query logic to happen on the database, but am open to application side processing for a speed payout.p  pThere are still some holes in this design. If a user only searches common terms, I have no choice but to hit the database with all the terms. From preliminary reading, I gather that it is not recommended or not supported to have multiple text indexes with different names on the same collection. My plan is to create two identical tables, each with my 6.8M records, with different indexes  one for common words and one for uncommon words. This feels kludgy and clunky, but am willing to do this for a speed increase.p  pDoes anyone have any insight andor advice on how to speed up this system. Id like as much processing to happen on the database as possible to keep it fast. Im sure my little 6.8M record table is not the largest that mongodb has seen. Thanksp

Negative 78160 pI would like to use Microsoft.Web.Administration.dll from within the SQL Server CLR in order to get the physical path of a specific web application at runtime, but the DLL is not available or tested in SQL Server, and adding it would require adding a chain of dependent DLLs also untested, so basically NEVERMIND all of the above.p  pOn to the issue, but first a short background.  The architecture of my database application is pretty fancy... a Database.Values namespace in database.dll contains a host of C classes, each of which subclass RegexConstrainedString or ConstrainedNumber both custom classes which represent regular expression and numeric value constraints for various fields in the database.  Each class is marked with attributes specifying various tablefieldname combinations indicating which table and field names each rule applies to in the database.p  pA deployment application takes that database.dll, uses reflection to find classes with the aforementioned attributes and dynamically generates in IL op codes a function for each class classname appended with Check, whose purpose is simply to attempt to instantiate a given string or number with the associated class and returns true or false depending on whether the instantiation was successful.  Instantiation fails when the string or number doesnt match the classs defined constraints.  The deployment app then uses ILMerge.exe to merge its dynamically generated functions with the original database.dll to produce a new database.dll which is deployed to SQL Server.  It then opens a GUI that allows for oneclick creation, enabling, and checking of all the associated SQL check constraint functions, which call the underlying CLR classbased Check functions that were generated.p  pAnyway... one of those classes in particular called Text enforces ASCII encoding on a field  by mapping Unicode strings to ASCII strings, and for completeness, it will map all 65536 possible twobyte 16bit UCS2 code point values to a specific ASCII character using a character map that is created and edited by a web application.  Sure, I could have just mapped everything outside the range 32126 to a question mark character, but I wanted greater control to the point where I mapped out every possible Unicode character to an ASCII character that it closely resembles, so its probably one of the most complete although subjective visual maps in existence.p  pThe problem is, the static constructor of the Text class that resides in database.dll in the SQL CLR needs to load that ASCII map file, which resides in the root of a particular web application.  How am I supposed to get that path without hard coding it and without the ability to use the Microsoft.Web.Administration.dlls call to codenew ServerManager.Sites[Default Web Site].Applications[utilities].VirtualDirectories[].PhysicalPathcodep

Negative 78160 pI have an app that uses codeUIImagecode objects. Up to this point, Ive been using image objects initialized using something like thisp  precodeUIImage image  [UIImage imageNamedimageName] codepre  pusing an image in my app bundle. Ive been adding functionality to allow users to use imagery from the camera or their library using codeUIImagePickerControllercode. These images, obviously, cant be in my app bundle, so I initialize the codeUIImagecode object a different wayp  precodeUIImage image  [UIImage imageWithContentsOfFilepathToFile] codepre  pThis is done after first resizing the image to a size similar to the other files in my app bundle, in both pixel dimensions and total bytes, both using Jpeg format interestingly, PNG was much slower, even for the same file size. In other words, the file pointed to by codepathToFilecode is a file of similar size as an image in the bundle pixel dimensions match, and compression was chosen so byte count was similar.p  pThe app goes through a loop making small pieces from the original image, among other things that are not relevant to this post. My issue is that going through the loop using an image created the second way takes much longer than using an image created the first way.p  pI realize the first method caches the image, but I dont think thats relevant, unless Im not understanding how the caching works. If it is the relevant factor, how can I add caching to the second methodp  pThe relevant portion of code that is causing the bottleneck is thisp  precode[image drawInRectself.imageSquare] codepre  pHere, self is a subclass of UIImageView. Its property imageSquare is simply a codeCGRectcode defining what gets drawn. This portion is the same for both methods. So why is the second method so much slower with similar sized codeUIImagecode objectp  pIs there something I could be doing differently to optimize this processp  pEDIT I change access to the image in the bundle to codeimageWithContentsOfFilecode and the time to perform the loop changed from about 4 seconds to just over a minute. So its looking like I need to find some way to do caching like codeimageNamedcode does, but with nonbundled files.p

As you can see I use 5.75 x 8.75 inches on the cfdocument.  This translates in the PDF document being 300DPI. When I load up the PDF document in photoshop it does state the document is in 300DPI.p  pYou might notice that the ImageNew uses 1725x2625 and the cfimage uses 1740x2625.  If I matched the cfimage dimensions to the imagenew which makes perfect sense, then you end up with having this white border on the top, right, and bottom. The image is still off by like 5 pixels on the width.  So I am forced to make it a bit bigger to get rid of that white border.  If I can just figure out why that image is 5 pixels off.p

Negative 78160 pIm new to RequireJS and the millions of new frontend tools and its overwhelming. Im starting a new multipage Backbone app. It is very similar in many ways to a previous project. My approach is to take the new one and make it much more modular and reusable. The previous app is build with Sinatra to route requests and vanilla Backbone. My approach with the new app is to use RequireJS to load certain modules on each page while still routing through Sinatra. I want to keep some things similar so as to possibly make this approach backwards compatible to potentially rewrite the previous app while still moving things in a more modular direction. p  pAnyway, I had sinatraassetpipeline installed in the previous app and now in the new app as well. I have a well defined app structure with the new app and well defined entry points for each page.

Initially I started with the Javascript API and it worked well until you sit behind a firewall and facebook is blocked then code.getScriptcode fails unmanageably, so I then started looking at the PHP library at least then the blocking is a visible to the user, b not my responsibility for trapping and handling and c fits nicely into the URL endpoint model I havep  pThe problem is that the BaseFacebook class uses cURL. GAE does not.p  pDoes anyone know of a way to build the authentication into GAE so I can use codelogin requiredcode or if not, can anyone with better streamscurl knowlege than me replace the cURL stuff in the BaseFacebook class.

Negative 78160 pIm working with some rather large, dense numpy float arrays that currently reside on disk in PyTables codeCArraycodes. I need to be able to perform efficient dot products using these arrays, for example codeC  A.dotBcode, where codeAcode is a huge 1E4 x 3E5 float32 memorymapped array, and codeBcode and codeCcode are smaller numpy arrays that are resident in core memory.p  pWhat Im doing at the moment is copying the data into memorymapped numpy arrays using codenp.memmapcode, then calling codenp.dotcode directly on the memorymapped arrays. This works, but I suspect that the standard codenp.dotcode or rather the underlying BLAS functions it calls is probably not very efficient in terms of the number of IO operations required in order to compute the result.p  pI came across an interesting example in a hrefhttpwww.tau.ac.ilstoledoBibPubsoocsurvey.pdfthis review articlea. A naive dot product computed using 3x nested loops, like thisp  precodedef naivedotA, B, C     for ii in xrangen         for jj in xrangen             C[ii,jj]  0             for kk in xrangen                 C[ii,jj]  A[ii,kk]B[kk,jj]     return C codepre  prequires emOn3em IO operations to compute.p  pHowever, by processing the arrays in appropriatelysized blocksp  precodedef blockdotA, B, C, M     b  sqrtM  3     for ii in xrange0, n, b         for jj in xrange0, n, b             C[iiiib,jjjjb]  0             for kk in xrange0, n, b                 C[iiiib,jjjjb]  naivedotA[iiiib,kkkkb],                                                  B[kkkkb,jjjjb],                                                 C[iiiib,jjjjb]     return C codepre  pwhere codeMcode is the maximum number of elements that will fit into core memory, the number of IO operations is reduced to emOn3  sqrtMem.p  pHow smart is codenp.dotcode andor codenp.memmapcode Does calling codenp.dotcode perform an IOefficient blockwise dot product Does codenp.memmapcode do any fancy caching that would improve the efficiency of this type of operationp  pIf not, is there some preexisting library function that performs IO efficient dot products, or should I try and implement it myselfp  h2Updateh2  pIve done some benchmarking with a handrolled implementation of codenp.dotcode that operates on blocks of the input array, which are explicitly read into core memory. This data at least a partially addresses my original question, so Im posting it as an answer.p

Negative 78160 pOkay, so I have a huge list of entries, and in one of the columns for simplicity lets call it strongemnumemstrong theres a number, something like code123456780000code they are all the same length and format, but sometimes there are fields that look something like this p  precode12345678E000  or  12345678H000 codepre  pNow, I need to delete all the rows in which the strongemnumemstrong column is not entirely numeric. The type of strongemnumemstrong is emTEXTem, not emINTEGERem. So the above examples should be deleted, while code123456780000code should not.p  pI have tried two solutions, of which one works but is inelegant and messy, and the other one doesnt work at all.p  pThe first thing I tried isp  precodeDELETE FROM MYTABLE WHERE absnum  0.0 codepre  pBecause according to the documentation, emabsXem returns exactly 0.0 if a emTEXTem value is given and is unconvertable to an real number. So I was thinking it should let all the numbersonly pass and delete the ones with a character in it. But it doesnt do a thing, it doesnt delete even a single row.p  pThe next thing I tried isp  precodeDELETE FROM MYTABLE WHERE num LIKE A OR B OR C codepre  pWhich seems to work, but the database is large and I am not sure which characters can appear, and while I could just do codeD OR E OR F OR ...code with the entire alphabet, this feels inelegant and messy. And I actually want to learn something about the SQLite language.p  pMy question, finally, is how do I solve this problem in a nice and simple way Perhaps theres something Im doing wrong with the emabsXem solution, or is there another way that I do not know ofthought ofp  pThanks in advance.p  pEDIT According to a comment I tried codeSELECT absnum FROM MYTABLE WHERE num like Acode and it returned the followingp  precode12345678.0 codepre  pThats strange. It seems it has split the number where the alphabetical appeared. The documentation claimed it would return 0.0 if it couldnt convert it to a number. Hmm..p
Negative 78160 pI am currently learning java and wanted to give myself a project that was both challenging and fun. I decided to build a game that I remember playing when I was a kid called dopewars.p  pThis is my second attempt at this game. When I began my first attempt, all went well. After a short while my source code began to fill wildly out of control until I could continue no more as I kept getting lost within mountains of code.p  pI then decided to begin again, only this time I wanted to seperate the gui from the logic 2 different .java files. This is where my problem lies. Previously this would work fine. Since seperating my java files the functionality has stopped.p  pWhen I press jbutton b1, my program is supposed to take the price value of cocaine and the units value entered into the jtextfield by the user, perform a calculation by accessing a method within Buy.java, and then update the appropriate JLabels within the s jpanel of GUI.java.p  pFor example, user x wants to buy cocaine at the price indicated, so he enters a value representing the quantity he would like. He then presses the buy button which ultimately deducts the money from his pocket which is shown on the left side of the program window by using a method within the Buy class.p  pI hope you can understand my explanation and I hope to hear from you soon. Thanks.in advance. My Source code is below.p

Negative 78160 pI have been racking my brain over this for some time now, so I am hoping someone can help and I am hoping I dont get dinged because the question might not have a definite, concrete answer.p  pWe have an IIS7.5 web environment running ASP.NET 4.0.x on Win2008 Advance Server. Clients use IE8 intranet site. We have a Siteminder protected directory within wwwroot. Almost all website files are located within this protected directory, thus requiring the user to authenticate through the companys SSO page the aforementioned Siteminder. IIS defaults for session timeouts are in place 20 minutes, which roughly correlates with our Siteminder policys timeout setting. The application pool runs in Integrated mode. We are not using Forms Authorization.p  pOur website has a logout button, as well as a mechanism in place to log the user out should there be a period of inactivity a JQuery plugin solution that provides a modal dialog 5 minutes before the expected time out an AJAX process checks an ASHX page which provides the session time left. p  pWhen logging out, the process makes a call to a logout ASHX page strongoutsidestrong of the secured directory mentioned above note I also tried this inside the secured directory with similar not desirable results I moved the logout ASHX page to a folder outside of the secured directory based on my research around my issue which is coming shortly. This logout ASHX clears and abandons the current session, removes the ASP.NETSessionId and the Siteminder cookies, and calls a URL to actually log the user out of their Siteminder session as recommended by the companys SSO team. The code for the logout ASHX is shown below...p  precodelt  WebHandler languageC classLogoutgt using System using System.Web using System.Web.SessionState using System.Configuration  log4net imports  using log4net using log4net.Config  public class Logout  IHttpHandler, IRequiresSessionState      private static readonly ILog log  LogManager.GetLoggertypeofLogout     private static string SSOLOGOUTURL  ConfigurationManager.AppSettings[SSOLogoutURL].ToString     public Logout      public void ProcessRequestHttpContext context          context.Session.Clear         context.Session.Abandon         HttpRequest Request  context.Request         string sRedirUrl  Request.QueryString[timeOutUrl]         if String.IsNullOrEmptysRedirUrl              sRedirUrl  httpsportal.somedomain.net                  HttpResponse Response  context.Response         HttpCookie cookie  new HttpCookieASP.NETSessionId,          cookie.Expires  DateTime.Now.AddYears1         Response.Cookies.Addcookie         cookie  new HttpCookieSMSESSION,          cookie.Expires  DateTime.Now.AddYears1         Response.Cookies.Addcookie         Response.Writelthtmlgtltheadgtltscript languagejavascriptgtfunction init location  sRedirUrl  ltscriptgtltheadgt         Response.Writeltbody onloadinitgt         Response.Writeltiframe src  SSOLOGOUTURL   width0 height0gtltiframegt         Response.Writeltbodygtlthtmlgt          in PROD, the ROOT level for log4net should be set above Debug, so this will not get logged we dont want it to  too much verbosity         log.Debuggtgtgt Logout called  session ended          public bool IsReusable           get               return false                codepre  pAll of this works as expected the user clicks the Logout button and they are directed to the companys intranet homepage if the countdown timer for the session reaches zero, the browser automatically redirects to a friendly Your session has timed out page with a link back into the site. Both of these actions go through the code above the logout ASHX.p  pMy problem occurs when the user attempts to access the site again after being logged out strongand within the same browser windowstrong close the browser and relaunch and everything works great as I would expect. Below is the error...p  precode[FormatException Unrecognized Guid format.]    System.GuidResult.SetFailureParseFailureKind failure, String failureMessageID, Object failureMessageFormatArgument, String failureArgumentName, Exception innerException 6076960    System.Guid.TryParseGuidString g, GuidStyles flags, GuidResultamp result 138    System.Guid..ctorString g 257    MSDN.SessionPersistence.LoadSessionString key, String dsn, Int32 SessionExpiration 332    MSDN.SessionPage.InitializeComponent 696    MSDN.SessionPage.OnInitEventArgs e 46    System.Web.UI.Control.InitRecursiveControl namingContainer 133    System.Web.UI.Page.ProcessRequestMainBoolean includeStagesBeforeAsyncPoint, Boolean includeStagesAfterAsyncPoint 1970 codepre  pThis occurs more often than not, but I cant seem to nail down a specific cause or specific steps to always reproduce the error. It seems to happen if the time between being logged out and the time a user tries to reaccess the page is on the long side versus more immediate. Research on the exact error just leads to topics on making sure the value passed into the GUID object is valid. I also tried researching the MSDN.SessionPersistence.LoadSession method but found few results that had no relevance to my problem. Nowhere in my code do I make explicit use of the GUID object.p  pThe logout ASHX is the result of my past weeks worth of investigation and trial and error. I thought I nailed it when I began deleting the ASP.NETSessionId cookie, but the error still occurs on a hitandmiss basis.p  pThe thing that is killing me is trying to figure out strongwhystrong I am getting this error. I believe I understand that sessions in ASP.NET are identified by a string of characters that must fit the formatting requirements for the GUID object, but I cannot determine why this is occurring shouldnt a new session be created with a new session id since I abandoned the old one strongandstrong deleted the ASP.NETSessionId cookie. Most recently I even put the following code into the main ASPX pages PageLoad method...p  precodeif User.Identity.IsAuthenticated      if Request.Cookies[ASP.NETSessionId]  null          HttpCookie cookie  new HttpCookieASP.NETSessionId,          cookie.Expires  DateTime.Now.AddYears1         Response.Cookies.Addcookie          HttpContext.Current.Session.Abandon  codepre  pI did this per another suggestion on another site. As you can probably see, I am beginning to grasp for straws here. I even used IE8s Developer Tools  Cache  View Cookie Information feature to see what was going on in each page the time out page does not show the ASP.NETSessionId or SMSESSION cookies.p  pSo, is my approach sound, or am i missing some key idea what I have so far is a culmination of research on SO and other sites Could the issue be outside of the CASP.NETIIS realm and exist because of Siteminder Any help would be greatly appreciated.p  pstrongUPDATEstrongp  pI did some more investigating around the timing of when this occurs. I waited for the logout to occur, then set timers at the 5, 10, 15, and 20 minute marks after each test, I closed the browser. I was able to successfully log back into the site at the 5, 10, and 15 minute marks, but at the 20 minute mark, I would receive the unrecognized guid format error.  Note that each time I logged back in, I mean I went through my companys Siteminder SSO login page the site itself does not have a log in mechanism  it is strictly protected by my companys Siteminderbased SSO login form. This still does not answer why this is occurring, but perhaps it narrows things down a bit. Is the problem with Siteminder or with IISASP.NET As best as I can tell, I am properly logging out of SSO based on other corporate intranet sites using the same URL for SSO logout.p

When looking at the properties view of the Microsoft.Web.FtpServer reference, the runtime version is v2.0.50727 so I dont see why there are .NET 4 framework references. p  pIve tried quite a few ways of resolving this issue including getting an earlier file version of the Microsoft.Web.FtpServer dll from another machine running IIS 7.5, including this in my machines GAC and updating the reference but with no success.p  pI understand this would should work fine on Windows Server 2012 with IIS 8 or later if it works on my local machine as a .NET 4 project, but it needs to work on Windows Server 2008 R2 with IIS 7.5.p  pHas anybody else come across this issue or have any advicep  pThanksp

Negative 78160 pI have a Sencha Touch 2 project and everything works great in the web browser. No errors in the console, and everything looks good. Once I package it with Phonegap and run it on a mobile device, however, things dont work as well.p  pI am using codeext.device.notification.showcode in two places in my application. At first, I was doing coderequires Ext.device.code and while it worked in web, the app wouldnt run on mobile and eclipse would give me the error message codeUncaught TypeError Cannot read property name of undefinedcode. I switched over to coderequires Ext.device.Notificationcode exact spelling and capitalization and now the app runs but when I click a button that should create a message box, I get the error codeUncaught TypeError Cannot call method confirm of undefinedcode.

Negative 78160 pEDIT I have a code that places markers on google maps with associated infowindows. What Id like to do is to fix the infowindow box. I created a container div with subdivs for the infowindow which is absolute and one for the map which is relative.

Negative 78160 pI have a need to encrypt certain fields in the database, so, I need to encrypt the data going into the database, and then decrypt it when displaying it. Ive already got my encryption methods and decryption methods set up and I had it working like this in, for example, an actionp  precodemodel.EncryptedProperty  EncryptviewModel.Property viewModel.Property  DecryptEncryptedProperty codepre  pThats fine, but my problem with it is that other developers will need to remember to encryptdecrypt a property any time they use the property.

Negative 78160 pI need to implement a way of recording an UDP stream with the purpose of later on replaying that stream as requested. This record and replay must use the same timing up to a sensible resolution, hardly perceivable by a human user, lets say 10ms if the original stream had data for seconds 0000 to 0035, then went mute till 0055, and then sent more data from 0055 to 0134, the same distribution must be observed when my application replays that stream.p  pIf it were just a matter of saving the udp stream to disk and then replaying it, without this timing, it would be trivial by either using Socket, NetworkStream or UdpClient. The issue is I cannot get around to devise a way to modify the standard receive algorithm to include that timing in a way that its somehow easily replayed later by the send algorithm. As a bonus, a way to start the replay at any time mark from 0015 on, for example should also be supported.p  p1 Is there any way to easily implement this functionality on C We do not have any severe nonfunctional requirement for this, we just need for it to simply work. Any hint about a way to implement it would be really appreciated.p  p2 If this is indeed not a simple matter and anyone suggests the use of any thirdparty component for this, the requirements would be for it to have an API for C or a way to operate the component from code, and hopefully be opensource or freely used software.p  pThank you very much.p

using the ListView to display a list of animal models, categorized by their size. In order to achieve this categorization in the view, I use the emsection.propertyem, emsection.critiriaem and emsection.delegateem properties of the ListView as implemented in the code given above.p  pstrongNotestrong Please ignore the fact that the model I supply to the ListView is not sorted, I understand that this will create numerous duplicate category entries in the ListView. This is beside the point here.p  pWhen the number of models exceed the visible area of the ListView, I am using the property emtotalPagesem to calculate how many full ListView pages there are for navigation. The Up arrow and Down arrow buttons simply decrement and increment the emcontent.Yem of the ListView by the height of the ListView respectively.p  pThe problem is that the emcontentHeightem of the ListView does not remain static, it is dynamically changing and causing my emtotalPagesem property calculation to be incorrect. p  pIt is interesting to note that this behavior occurs if and only if I set a height for my emsectionHeaderDelegateem rectangle. If I comment out the height statement height 50, the emcontentHeightem of the ListView remains static, as expected  with the downside that the section headerscategories are now on top of the model text, which is not useful at all.p  pstrongSo my question is, why does the contentHeight of the QML ListView element dynamically change if and only if I use a section delegate whos height has been set to a nonzero valuestrongp  pAlso, I have left the following properties in the ListView for testing purposes, the ListView should be used with the UpDown arrowsp  blockquote precode          interactive true           flickableDirection Flickable.VerticalFlick           boundsBehavior Flickable.StopAtBounds codepre blockquote

Negative 78160 pNew programmer here. This is probably a really basic question, but its stumping me nevertheless.p  pWhat Im trying to do is write a method that supplies only one integer input so I can use that input in my main program without having to mess around with noninteger inputs. However, even writing the method to do that in its own method seems to be problematic.p  precodepublic static int goodInput       Scanner input  new Scanner System.in construct scanner     boolean test  input.hasNextInt set a sentinel value     while test  false  enter a loop until I actually get an integer         System.out.printlnIntegers only please tell user to give me an integer         test  input.hasNextInt get new input, see if its an integer          int finalInput  input.nextInt once i have an integer, set it to a variable     input.close closing scanner     return finalInput return my integer so I dont have to mess around with hasNextInt over there  codepre  pThis seems to be broken in multiple levels, but Im not really sure why.p  pIf I enter an integer value like 0 or 1 when Im first asked for input, it should skip the loop entirely. But, instead, it enters the loop, and prints Integers only please. Even worse, it doesnt actually ask for input while Im in there, and just prints that line repeatedly. p  pI understand the latter problem is probably due to token issues, but Im not necessarily sure how to solve them closing and then reopening the scanner gets Eclipse to bug me over duplicate objects, simply assigning the old input to a garbage String variable that is never used tells me that No line was found at runtime, and Im not experienced enough to think of other ways to get new input.p  pEven once thats solved, I need to find some way to avoid entering the loop in the case of having an integer. I dont really understand why integer inputs inter the loop to begin with, so Im not sure how this would be possible. p  pPlease help Sorry if this is an old question tried looking at past questions but none of them seem to have the same problem that I have.p

Negative 78160 pI wonder if anyone could help me with some questions on Jenkins. We are using Jenkins for both .Net frontend and J2EE backend projects.p  ul lipWhen using Jenkins to build a .Net project, what would be the step to package the whole project with all the dependencies after build for deployment I did all the setup with Nuget to grab dependencies and the build is success but Im still confused about packaging. Im not sure if I should use Archive the artifacts in Add Post Build step or should I use Command Line Arguments under MSBuild. From my understanding, by using Archive the artifacts in Add Post Build step we can archive the whole package as a zip file for .Net project or .war.jar file for Java project. If this is the case, what should I put in Files to archive fieldpli lipOn the other hand, when using MSBuild I put in these lines under Command Line Argumentsp  ppConfigurationRelease  pDeployTargetPackage  pCreatePackageOnPublishTrue  pDeployIisAppPathCProject pPackageLocationCProjectSolutionFile.zip pIntermediateOutputPathCProjectTemppli ul  pWhen looking at the output, it gives me a PackageTmp folder with contents that I want for the project. However, outside of PackageTmp folder is a Package folder with .cmd, .txt, and two of .xml files. May I ask if these files are used for deployment with MSDeploy.exe Beside that, outside of Package folder is another folder with lot of .dll, .pdb, and .cache files. May I ask what are these files for and do I need them The MSBuild also creates a TransformWebConfig folder, I dont know what is this folder for. I come from Java background and Im not familiar with .Net stack. Im also not sure if the Command Line Arguments I used for MSBuild are correct.p  pOn the other hand, we use NetBean with our Java project. My understanding is NetBean uses Ant to manage the dependencies. Should we switch to Maven to manage dependencies under Jenkins What would be the ProsCons of using Ant or Maven especially under Jenkins I apologize for asking many questions.

Negative 78160 pIm trying to make a multiplayer game for Android via WiFi direct. I followed the instructions on a hrefhttpdeveloper.android.comtrainingconnectdeviceswirelesslywifidirect.html relnofollowhttpdeveloper.android.comtrainingconnectdeviceswirelesslywifidirect.htmla in order to connect to devices.p  pThe ActionListener i use with codediscoverPeerscode returns successfully, but then i never receive the codeWIFIP2PPEERSCHANGEDACTIONcode intent upon which i would call coderequestPeerscode. Strangely when i go into WiFi direct system settings on one device, the other is able to successfully detect it through my app. Do i need to make my device discoverable in my app or something I havent found anything to indicate that in the Android developer resources regarding WiFi P2P. There is WiFi direct for service discovery, but thats something else entirely, isnt itp
Negative 78160 pScratching my head, this should be relatively easy but I cant figure it out. I want to build a header that is sticky fixed to top and responsive in the way that it switches to a mobile menu layout at a certain breakpoint. The mobile layout should have a full window height, having the navigation items in a vertical row, whereas the desktop mode should align them horizontally. In addition to that I need to contain the contents for the desktop mode at a certain width.p  pMy problem is, as I need to set the header or a container to a fixed position I also need to be able to switch height once the mobile layout sets in, from say 100px to 100 height. This is not possible if nesting an absolute  fixed element inside of a fixed, as the parents height will be forced on it.p  pAny ideas on how to approach thisp  pdiv classsnippet datalangjs datahidefalse div classsnippetcode pre classsnippetcodecss langcss prettyprintoverridecode    margin 0   padding 0   outline 0   ,   before,    after    webkit  box  sizing border  box  moz  box  sizing border  box   box  sizing border  box  html, body    height 100    nav    position absolute   width 100     height 100     background rgba0, 0, 0, .5  ul    list  style none   text  align center  li    background eee   margin 0 0 1px 0  header    position fixed   width 100     height 60px   background rgba0, 0, 0, .5  .container    max  width 960px   margin auto  .object first  of  type    background 99cc66  .object      background  66ccff   height 100    media screen andmin  width 640px    ul      text  align left     float right      li      background none     display inline    codepre pre classsnippetcodehtml langhtml prettyprintoverridecodeltheadergt   ltdiv classcontainergt     ltnavgt       ltulgt         ltligtlta hrefgt1ltagt         ltligt         ltligtlta hrefgt2ltagt         ltligt         ltligtlta hrefgt3ltagt         ltligt         ltligtlta hrefgt4ltagt         ltligt       ltulgt     ltnavgt   ltdivgt ltheadergt  ltdiv classobjectgtltdivgt  ltdiv classobjectgtltdivgtcodepre div div p

Negative 78160 pWhen it comes to templating my understanding is that you can do several thingsp  ol liServe static pages.li liPre Compile everything jade to html once and then serve the same thing to all.li liAt every request render everything and then serve.li liRender static parts ahead of time when app starts and render dynamic parts at request.li liServe vanilla html and render dynamic part at request.li liSend vanilla html  template and libraryengine and render at client.li ol  pWhat i want to do is number 5 and if not then 4. I dont want to rewrite all html, css etc. For the sake of just templating. I want to stick to html. But for part that needs to be dynamic id like templating.

Id like to be able at least precompile the static part of the page and then compile user specific dynamic part at request. p  pI was looking into jade, but i cant figure out how would i do that Is there a way, there should be, that i can type jade within html so only parts are dynamic are done in jade. I was told to compile jade, then append it to vanilla html. This is not ok. Because it requires me manually piece together html which isnt viable solution if you have lots of html and pages. p  pI hope everything is clear..if not leave a comment. p

Negative 78160 pI have a large array of primitive valuetypes.  The array is in fact one dimentional, but logically represents a 2dimensional field.  As you read from left to right, the values need to become the original value of the current cell  the result calculated in the cell to the left.  Obviously with the exception of the first element of each row which is just the original value.p  pI already have an implementation which accomplishes this, but is entirely iterative over the entire array and is extremely slow for large 1M elements arrays.p  pGiven the following example array,p  precode0 0 1 0 0 2 0 0 0 3 0 4 1 1 0 0 1 0 4 1 codepre  pBecomesp  precode0 0 1 1 1 2 2 2 2 5 0 4 5 6 6 0 1 1 5 6 codepre  pAnd so forth to the right, up to problematic sizes 1024x1024p  pThe array needs to be updated ideally, but another array can be used if necessary.  Memory footprint isnt much of an issue here, but performance is critical as these arrays have millions of elements and must be processed hundreds of times per second.p  pThe individual cell calculations do not appear to be parallelizable given their dependence on values starting from the left, so GPU acceleration seems impossible.  I have investigated PLINQ but requisite for indices makes it very difficult to implement.p  pIs there another way to structure the data to make it faster to processp  pemIf efficient GPU processing is feasible using an innovative teqnique, this would be vastly preferable, as this is currently texture data which is having to be pulled from and pushed back to the video card.emp

Negative 78160 pHow can we implement the following function for linuxlike operating systemsp  pThe function has already been running on any windows version Windows 98 for about 15 years. It imitates multithreading in a single thread and runs in both single or multi threading models, without blocking the invoking thread while waiting for the events. Recursive calls and returns may happen depending on outerevents but this simple function has always worked fine so far. The same logic MAY NOT be possible in linux, but a similar approach would be appreciable. I havent changed any letter of the function to keep it as it is.

Didnt help. I tried numerous solutions. p  pWell I have an index page that loads codeincludesdata.phpcode which loads the data from database and echo the .js format that is then loaded by function and display data on the page, so I have at the end of my index.php something like thisp  precodeltscript typetextjavascript srcincludesdata.phpgtltscriptgt codepre  pOn the same index page I have a form that inserts data to database. If you refresh the page I will see refreshed codeincludesdata.phpcode along with new data I just inputted. p  pI am trying to implement AJAX so that when I click on the button I insert the data to database already achieved this and to refresh content of codeincludesdata.phpcode and codeindex.phpcode so it shows data right away without refreshing the codeindex.phpcode. This is my AJAX codep  precodeaddtocal.submit function       .ajax         url      this.attraction,         type     this.attrmethod,         data     this.serialize,         success  function data                           This is the part where I am stuck.                   ,         error    function                      .error.fadeIn2000                      .error.fadeOut2000                              return false  codepre  pJust to mention that codecalendarcode is where main jquery function is loading the html content based on the info from codeincludesdata.phpcode. Thank you in advance for any help you can provide and let me know if you need any other information from me in order to better assist me.p  pP.S. I saw many suggested using .load to load content from codeincludesdata.phpcode but that is not working in my case as the content from codeincludesdata.phpcode needs to serve other jquery function that creates html on the fly and and place it in codecalendarcodep

Negative 78160 pI have a website set up with RequireJS and Angular, but at seemingly random moments, it will decide to either not load part of the Javascript or not databind part of the angular code.p  pThe page in question has several different components on it with their own angular controllers. Everything loads fine about 90 of the time, but sometimes something will happen that prevents databinding angular brackets visible, nghide not working,.... Additionally, the network tab in Chrome devtools shows no files being loaded, though they are listed in sources. I dont know if that is relevant somehow. I get no errors in the console at all.p  pDigging around in the JS console Ive found that one of the broken controllers in question does exist   I get an object using codeangular.element....scopecode  but when I try to access one of its properties, they are either undefined OR in case of the codeinitcode function I use in all my controllers, it returns the function of the parent controller. p  pWhat could cause the controller to be loaded but its scope variables to be undefined at seemingly random timesp  pEDIT The only way Ive found to sort of reproduce this issue without errors showing up in the console is to initialise the controller as an empty function. This produces similar scope behavior in the console, but it doesnt cause the angular curly braces to show up. I will accept any clue that leads me to the cause of the issue or a viable workaround. p

As further info, the servlet lays in a IBM Portal environment and happens only using IE8 in that particular environment.p  pI also tried importing codejquery.iframetransport.jscode in my project, setting codeiframe truecode as an additional option to the ajax call, but didnt work.p  pThis is what I should get data coderesult ok, ...codep  pThis is what Im currently getting data codeltDIV idBannerTopScrollgtltDIVgtltIFRAME width10 height10[...]code very long DIV element...p  pHave you ever experienced an issue like thisp  pThank you in advance for all your help.p

Negative 78160 pIm seeing a weird linking issue on Linux with a crossplatform library project that uses CMake to create both an OS X Framework and a Linux shared library from the same source tree. The crossplatform aspect of that project has worked well in the past up to about two years ago, but since then, we have exclusively done development work on OS X. The reason for the temporary Linux abandonment was a developer shortage all those who remained used OS X  there was no technical reason for not building the source on Linux for some years. p  pAnd with one potentially relevant exception more on this later, there have been no fundamental changes to our source in the meantime. But of course Linux has advanced so of course there were some minor snags at first when we went back there. Things like the new version of the compiler complaining about things they had not complained about in the past questionable casts, void pointer voodoo, and such. These issues were resolved in short order.p  pThe entire source tree now compiles again on Mint 17.1 with some definitely harmless remaining warnings. But linking fails with a rather bizarre messagep  precodeLinking CXX shared library libltourLibNamegt.so CMakeFilesltfile1gt.c.o11 error stray 177 in program CMakeFilesltfile1gt.c.o11 error stray 2 in program CMakeFilesltfile2gt.c.o11 error stray 213 in program and so on, thousands of times, with seemingly random values in the quotes for all the object files in the library codepre  pTo me, this looks like the linker is accidentally trying to emcompileem the object files one more time, instead of linking them. Switching between gcc and clang made no difference.p  pAs I already said, there was one potentially relevant structural change to the project since it last compiled under Linux it used to be a combination of only C and ObjectiveC sources. It now contains C, ObjectiveC strongemas well as ObjectiveCemstrong source. On OS X, this change has not caused any issues whatsoever, and it is very hard for me to imagine that this addition of some .mm files is causing what we are seeing here. But still  weirder things have happened.p  pAlso, there is a popular issue with several articles on stackoverflow about erroneously including unicode characters in CC programs. This is not the problem here  no such messages appear during the actual compilation. The circus only starts once linking should happen.p  pThe source tree is far too large to post, and the CMake files are also fairly involved, nested, and large i.e. impossible to include here. To add insult to injury, they have worked fine in the past, on Ubuntu 10.10. Which I dont have around anymore, to test if the current tree still works there that would have been far too easy, I guess. The relevant commands in the CMakeList that generate the library under Linux arep  precodesettargetproperties     ltourLibNamegt      PROPERTIES         VERSION    2.0         SOVERSION  2       targetlinklibraries     ltourLibNamegt     ourotherlinklibraries       install      TARGETS         ltourLibNamegt     DESTINATION         lib      codepre  pwhich still looks o.k. to me at first glance. How do I proceed here Im out of ideas on what to try next.p  pP.S. versions of the software involved Cmake 2.8.11, gcc 4.8.2, clang 3.41ubuntu3.p

Negative 78160 pMost of the times when I read comparisons between vectors and lists, the greater performance of vectors when it comes to sequential reading was ascribed to the cache while to read from a list one has to continuously jump from one memory location to another, reading from an array is completely sequential, so most of the data gets prefetched in cache because neighboring elements have been fetched immediately before.p  pHowever, as far as my understanding goes, strongcache lines sizes are on average in the order of 64 bytesstrong. This is actually pretty small I understand that if I am looping over chars, or ints, that can be a benefit since I have to actually load from memory maybe one item over 16, but if I am working with anything bigger than that, even a reasonably small structure with some doubles or so, the benefit of using a vector should be nearly null. Since this doesnt seem to be the case I usually get performance improvements also when using bigger data structures, what are the other differences between lists and vectors Is there some different form of prefetching due to the CPU pipelinep

Negative 78160 pQuite a mouthfull of a question but its a OO principle Ive struggling with. Lets say i have an ecommerce app and there is the concept of payment method, examples could be CreditCard, Paypal, Apple pay etc. The user has a choice of which payment method to select so i need to present them all in a list on the screen and depending on the selection this will be used to drive a UI, presenting different textimagesinteractions as well as will be serialised slightly differently into a Payment request over the wire. p  pHere is some codep  precodepublic class PaypalPayment  PaymentMethod       public string Token     public string String    public class CreditCardPayment  PaymentMethod       public Address Address     public CreditCard CreditCard    interface PaymentMethod      public class Booking      public PaymentMethod PaymentMethod generic object      or      public PaypalPayment PaypalPayment     public CreditCardPayment CreditCardPayment  codepre  pSo in my booking class i can either have a generic payment object referred to by the interface but i cant get to the underlying type without casting which sucks, as in reality them dont share any common properties domanwise. Alternatively i have multiple properties which feels bad in a different way. The user can only select one payment method so the others will have to null or some kind of null object, i would have to either query an enum or ask each payment method if it is null. Also my payment method select screen is a bit more cumbersome as i cant just iterate on a generic type i have to explicitly build up the list.p  pIn theory i could add some methods to the PaymentMethod interface, such as Serialise or some UI presentation methods which all the payment methods have in common but then i would have to implement them in my model object which i dont want to do in my model layer.p  pOverall i dont have a clean solution for this in your typical object orientated language. I wrote this in c but this could apply to any OO language.p

Negative 78160 pSince my primary language is C, and is often praised for its hardware capabilities, I decided to get into computer architecture a little more. As I was looking through some stuff, I stumbled upon device drivers. So, naturally, I decided to look it up. From my understanding, the device driver is a computer program that handles specific hardware components. I also know that the kernel is a computer program that acts as a bridge from software to hardware. For some reason, my mind cant differentiate the two. When it comes to the windows platform, can somebody explain the difference to me and explain the different roles that they play. Thanks in advance.p

But if I do p  precodegridSVGexport.gridplot codepre  pThen the SVG file exported looks squashed as it does in the RStudio plot window.

Negative 78160 pI am debugging some C software, and want to modify an existing function slightly, so that it changes the value of a particular variable used elsewhere in the program.p  pThe function is currently defined as sop  precodevoid DataStoresetEraseSelected     ...

But, I now want to modify the function, so that it will change the value of a variable used elsewhere in the program. To do this, I have tried passing the variable into the function as a parameter I have also updated the header file to reflect the changes to the function, and then assigning a value to the variable inside the functionp  precodevoid DataStoresetEraseSelectedtoAMSDataMessage statusMsg     ...

They all seem to suggest that the compiler is possibly looking in the wrong place, but if I undo my changes, then the code compiles with no problems, and I havent told the compiler to look anywhere else when building the code with my changes...p

Negative 78160 pIm very new to Rails so this may be an obvious problem, and if so I apologize.p  pI am trying to create a form for creating a  codeUsercode record, which has a codebelongstocode association with a codeTeamcode model.

Negative 78160 pI have been following the Learn To Code By Making Games Block breaker game section course from Udemy and Im on about lecture 80 and I just realised that I can click my mouse more than once, and it will start my ball moving again, while in game and while the ball is already moving. I hope you know what Im trying to say. So basically I want the ball to fire when the mouse is clicked, and then not have any effect after that. But also keep into consideration, the game has lives, so once one life is lost, so the game should basically reset so the player can continue with the game like atari breakout does.

Negative 78160 pScenario I have been developing a web application for management of small and mediumsized enterprises. Some time ago we used login and password authentication that were stored in our database. Nowadays when everyone uses facebook we moved to FacebookGoogle OAuth2 authentication as well. p  pThe problem is, there are some key operations that have to be especially secured e.g. changing addresses, accessing clients details. The best way to do this is I guess to ask users for retyping them credentials just before these risky operations are executed. But, since I use social authentication I can not confirm credentials anymore  p  pIs there any way that I can force Facebook or other OAuth2 provider to reask users for credentials even they are already logged inp

Negative 78160 pNow i need to call mvc action by using URL and send parameters to this action in URL this action take parameters and insert row in Database ..... but i found strange issue in that when i call this function by its URL in azure ,Sometimes the function called twice or three or four times  although i enter URL one time and sometimes the function executed one time when i called it by URL . Im sure that the function is right and this function is nt recursion function and hasnt go to ...But in my Local machine when i call this function by URL its executed one time always so i couldnt generate this issue local to trace it and know the reason of this issue ...So I suspect the browser may call function more than once when i enter URL .... i searched about problem like my problem but i didnt find any thing so if some one see some thing like my issue and know the reason i wish to tell me and thanks in advance p

Negative 78160 pI came across the following situation and am wondering whether the way I implemented it is good in terms of reusability and speed, Id also be interested to have an actual compilable solution since the one below doesnt compile I hope some one finds the culprit and has a simple and elegant idea on this.p  pThere are two Java classes Vec3F and Vec3 that implement basic vector math for floating point and double types. Both implement interface below as followsp  precodepublic final class Vec3 implements VecltVec3gt  ..     public double distanceVec3 other  ..    public interface VecltVgt       double distanceV other         codepre  pI did this to be able to have some algorithms work with both types of vector implementations, and here comes the problemp  precodepublic class Toolbox   public static ltTgt double getAllDistancesListltVecltTgtgt points      VecltTgt prevPoint  points.get0     VecltTgt point     double sum  0.0     int len  points.size     for int i1iltlen i          point  points.geti         gt this doesnt compile          The method distanceT in the type VecltTgt is not applicable for the arguments VecltTgt             sumpoint.distanceprevPoint         prevPoint  point          return sum   codepre  pI know that I could implement getAllDistances twice but this is what I want to avoid. Id love to have a Toolbox class that can do some metaalgorithms based on methods declared in the interface. I also want to avoid to change the method implementation of e.g. distanceVec3 other to have the interface passed because it uses e.g. other.xother.x directly to avoid calling any getters.p  pId be glad for some thoughts on this and hope the question is clear and specific enough, thanks in advancep

Negative 78160 pBeing new to Python, i have this pseudo code on my mindp  precodeif vars 14 are passed and all of them are 1     if its var1 or 2         printa     if its var3         printb     if its var4         printc  if vars 14 are passed and all of them are either 2, 3 or 4     if its var1 or 2         printd     if its var3         printe and so on  if vars 14 are passed and all of them are either 0 or 510     if its var1 or 2         printf and so forth codepre  pI have tried a few approaches, but am yet to manage it. For instancep  precodeif arg in [var1, var2, var3, var4] and [var1, var2, var3, var4]  1     if var in [var1, var2]         printa     if var  var3         printb     if var  var4         printc  if arg in [var1, var2, var3, var4] and 2 lt [var1, var2, var3, var4] lt 4     if var in [var1, var2]         printd and so on  if arg in [var1, var2, var3, var4] and 5 lt [var1, var2, var3, var4] lt 10  put the 0     if var in [var1, var2]         printf and so forth codepre  pThe part with codeif test in [var1, var2, var3, var4]code works fine with using all 4 variables, but not so with checking if they are equal to 1. Furthermore, the second part, with the range and third with range  0 is even worse. I could probably split all of these and test them individually with an OR in front of each and everyone of them, but thats impossible in the long run with more variables. Surely, there must be some more Pythonic wayp  pstrongFor clarification on usagestrong Code is used inside a function which takes one argument 1 of 4 variables at a time, depending on which var14 different printouts should be made. Variables are entered by the user, stored outside the function and can be in the range of 010, independently of each other.p

Negative 78160 pMy game requires the bottom of the screen to be seen, but not so much the top of the screen, because it is a game where the player is always on the bottom of the screen.
