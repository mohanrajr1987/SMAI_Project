Positive 543 pi seem to be having minor trouble with a program thats suppose to simulate a printer queue. A printer which is a queue in a stack is assigned a specific speed at which it will print. for example  if a printer has a speed of 5 and a document has a size in blocks  of 20 it would take the printer 4 passes to complete.p  pI seem to have the logic down in the code but the testerProgram i was given wants the printer to make one pass per step. I.E step onedoc size  20 passes  0  step twodoc size  15  passes 1 etc. I currently have it so when you call the print method it prints all the documents in its queue in a while loop.

Positive 543 pI currently have a disagreement going on with my 2nd year JAVA professor that Im hoping yall could help solvep  pThe code we started with was thisp  precode   public T peek            if isEmpty        .........        public boolean isEmpty             return topIndexlt0     codepre  pAnd she wants us to remove the codeisEmptycode reference and place its code directly into the codeifcode statement i.e. change the peek method contents to codeiftopIndexlt0.......code to Make the code more efficient. I have argued that a the runtimecompile time optimizer would most likely have inlined  the codeisEmpty call, bcode even if it didnt, the 510 machine operations would be negligible in nearly every situation, and c its just bad style because it makes the program less readable and less changeable.p  pSo, I guess my question is Is there any runtime efficiency gained by inlineing logic as opposed to just calling a method I have tried simple profiling techniques aka long loop and a stopwatch but tests have been inconclusive.    p

Positive 543 pIm working on this program that emulates restriction enzymes and DNA splicing. Im using DnaSequenceNode[s] as linked list nodes. p  pI have a problem with one of the function in my code, cutSplice is supposed to create a new DnaStrand that is a clone of the current DnaStrand, but with every instance of enzyme replaced by splicee. p  pFor example, if the LinkedDnaStrand is instantiated with TTGATCC, and cutSpliceGAT, TTAAGG is called, then the linked list should become something like previous pointers not shownp  pfirst  TT  TTAAGG  CC  nullp  pMy function works.

Positive 543 pi have a library and a lot of projects depending on that library. I want to optimize certain procedures inside the library using SIMD extensions. However it is important for me to stay portable, so to the user it should be quite abstract. I say at the beginning that i dont want to use some other great library that does the trick. I actually want to understand if that what i want is possible and to what extent.p  pMy very first idea was to have a vector wrapper class, that the usage of SIMD is transparent to the user and a scalar vector class could be used in case no SIMD extension is available on the target machine. The naive thought came to my mind to use the preprocessor to select one vector class out of many depending on which target the library is compiled. So one scalar vector class, one with SSE something like this basically a hrefhttpfastcpp.blogspot.de201112simplevector3classwithssesupport.html relnofollowhttpfastcpp.blogspot.de201112simplevector3classwithssesupport.htmla and so on... all with the same interface. This gives me good performance but this would mean that i would have to compile the library for any kind of SIMD ISA that i use. I rather would like to evaluate the processor capabilities dynamically at runtime and select the best implementation available.p  pSo my second guess was to have a general vector class with abstract methods. The processor evaluator function would than return instances of the optimal implementation. Obviously this would lead to ugly code, but the pointer to the vector object could be stored in a smart pointerlike container that just delegates the calls to the vector object. Actually I would prefer this method because of its abstraction but Im not sure if calling the virtual methods actually will kill the performance that i gain using SIMD extensions.p  pThe last option that i figured out would be to do optimizations whole routines and select at runtime the optimal one. I dont like this idea so much because this forces me to implement whole functions multiple times. I would prefer to do this once, using my idea of the vector class i would like to do something like this for examplep  precodevoid Memcopyvoid dst, void src, sizet size      vector v     forint i  0 i lt size i  v.size              v.loadsrc         v.storedst         dst  v.size         src  v.size       codepre  pI assume here that size is a correct value so that no overlapping happens. This example should just show what i would prefer to have. The sizemethod of the vector object would for example just return 4 in case SSE is used and 1 in case the scalar version is used. Is there a proper way to implement this using only runtime information without loosing too much performance Abstraction is to me more important than performance but as this is a performance optimization i wouldnt include it if would not speedup my application.p  pI also found this on the web a hrefhttpcompeng.unifrankfurt.devc relnofollowhttpcompeng.unifrankfurt.devca Its open source but i dont understand how the correct vector class is chosen.p
Positive 543 pI have a basic question about which optimization function I should use. I havep  ol lipA model of my system implemented as a python function. This function takes a one dimensional array and outputs a one dimensional array, and also takes a handful of parameters usually less than 10.pli lipNoisy sample output from that function with unknown input parameters.pli lipLower and upper bounds on each of the parameters.pli ol  pWhat I wantp  pAn optimization routine that allows me to throw all of the above in and get bestfit function parameters out.p  pI would like to treat the function as a black box, so no assumptions on it being continuous.p  pI had some luck with the codescipy.optimize.curvefitcode function, however it seemed very susceptible to deviations in the initial guess. codecurvefitcode also didnt let me provide bounds on the input, which I think would greatly simplify the problem. Here is the code I used with curvefitp  precodeimport numpy as np from scipy import optimize  def modelx, c, d     res  np.sqrtd2.02  xc2  d2.0     res[np.isnanres]  0     return res  x  np.arange1000, 1000, 200 y  modelx, 0, 250 ynoise  y  np.random.randleny  20  10  popt, pcov  optimize.curvefitmodel, x, ynoise, 50, 200 codepre  pThe above code returned 50, 200 as the optimized parameters, which is wrong. If I change the initial guess from 50, 200 to 49, 200 then the optimized parameters it returns are 1.84747802,  247.18634951, which is close enough to the truth of 0, 250p  pResearching online seems to indicate that either RBF or least squares could help me. However I am having trouble posing my problem as something to be minimized.p  pAn example of calling my model above with the correct function would be greatly appreciated, as would general pointers to more reading that might help me.p  pThanks in advance.p

Positive 543 pAccording to this a hrefhttpwww.oracle.comtechnetworkarticlessql11gsqlplanmanagement101938.html relnofollowOracle documentationa, I can assume that the Optimizer postpones the hard parse and it doesnt generate an execution plan until the first time a prepared statement is executedp  pThe answer is a phenomenon called bind peeking. Earlier, when you ran that query with the bind variable value set to NY, the optimizer had to do a hard parse for the first time and while doing so it peeked at the bind variable to see what value had been assigned to it.p  pBut when executing an EXPLAIN PLAN for a prepared statement with bind parameters, we get an executed plan. On his site, a hrefhttpusetheindexluke.comsqlwhereclausebindparameters relnofollowMarkus Winanda says thatp  pWhen using bind parameters, the optimizer has no concrete values available to determine their frequency. It then just assumes an equal distribution and always gets the same row count estimates and cost values. In the end, it will always select the same execution plan.p  pWhich one is true Does an execution plan get generated when the statement is prepared using an evenly distribution value model, or is the hard parsing postponed until the first execution time. p

Positive 543 pIm wondering under what circumstances compilers like GCC and LLVM are able to optimize multiple calls in the same function to some of the trivial member functions like codesizecode and codelengthcode of STL containers to just one callp  pFor example, if I compare values to the size of a container twice in the same function, but never actually change the container can it combine these into one function call and if so whenp  pThe compiler should be able to do an optimization unless it might think that another thread could be mucking with the container simultaneously. On the other hand the typical codeit  x.endcode guard in a loop seems to be optimized to just one call to codex.endcode and I presume this happens, because if some other thread would be addingdeleting stuff from codexcode, then it would invalidate the iterator codeitcode, so were free to do the optimization, since we would have undefined behavior anyway.p

[ Position  x, y  [ Units paperunits ] ]      [ Width winwidth [ Units paperunits ] ]      [ Height winheight [ Units paperunits ] ]     ..... this goes on for about 20 commands, all optional. codepre  pWhere anyhting in between [] is optional.p  pSo I need to create a class lets call it strongCommandBuilderstrong that can will have set methods for all these optional setters, thats fine I can handle that, the main problem Im having is the ToCommandString method that needs to ouput a string which would look somthing likep  precodeSet Window 1 Position x,y Units m Height 100 Units m  what ever else the user added codepre  pJust doing a few ifs based on variables that get set and joining the string works fine when there is nothing complicated about the variables being set or there are only a few variables but when there are heaps of variables andor nested values that are also optional, it can make the ToString method very long and complicated   hard to maintain if anything changes.p  pI was wondering if I could solve this by using polymorphism by doing something like this.p  precodeinterface ICommand      string ToCommandString   class PositionCommand  ICommand      double X     double Y     string Units      public PositionCommanddouble x, double y              this.X  x         this.Y  y           public PositionCommanddouble x,double y, string units              this.X  x         this.Y  y         this.Units  units           public string ToCommandString              Add more stuff here to handle empty units.         return String.Format Postion 0,1, X.ToString, Y.ToString       ....more command classes. codepre  pThen all my set methods in strongCommandBuilderstrong can just create the right command type add it to a list, then the main ToString in strongCommandBuilderstrong method can loop through all the ones that have been set and call ToCommandString and no have to worry about doing any if statments or null checks. p  pWould this be the correct way to go about this p  pP.S. If you need more info I would be glad to add, just didnt want to make it to long first go.p

Negative 543 pIve asked a few questions on this topic before.  Before were able to implement either MVC or LINQ at work we need to resolve a few issues.p  pstrongMultiple Record Sets in ASP.NET MVCstrongp  pThe only examples of MVC in use only have a single result set returned.  When using stored procedures multiple record sets can be retrieved, and the whole reason we tend to use stored procedures is for two reasons which Im sure many of you are also aware of.  Firstly in case we need to pass parameters, and secondly if we want multiple tables of data returned.  How is this possible in ASP.NETs MVC architecturep  pIn a hrefhttpwww.asp.netlearnmvctutorial11vb.aspxthis tutoriala we see how the data is retrieved.  But it uses codeViewData.Modelcode which indicates a single result set, it doesnt explain what happens if multiple result sets are returned, or how to get them.p  pstrongStrongly Typed Stored Procedure Outputstrongp  pAdditionally, the examples on the ASP.NET website for using LINQ for strongly typed resolution of output are achieved by using the .dbml format which is a mirror image of the table schema allowing for the lookup against fields using LINQ.  Great.  But what happens if your output is custom from a stored procedure which does not map directly to either a view or a table How do we resolve column names from these stored procedures p  pIn the previous section I described a hrefhttpwww.asp.netlearnmvctutorial11vb.aspxthis tutoriala, but this also only shows how to create LINQ to SQL for tables only, not the custom output from a sproc. p  pstrongLINQ Column Lookupsstrongp  pAt work we run a macro which exports a bunch of classes to our AppCode folder so stored procedure parameters are predefined.  This is done so we dont have to call DeriveParameters which consists of an extra call to the database.  We dont want this to happen because theres a lot of traffic as it is.  If were using LINQ, how are column data types resolved Is there a call to the database everytime we define a parameter to find out the data type and name of the parameter  Have things changed since Does it still call DeriveParameters every time Are these cached somewherep  pstrongDBML Formatsstrongp  pShould .dbml files incorporate all tables from a database  We have about 15 databases with many, many tables in each one.p  pstrongA View For Every Outputstrongp  pYet another point to add to this post.  Instead of manually creating the dbml classes is it better to represent the data as a view, even if its custom output Or is it better to create a custom class in the dbml filep  pstrongThis Must Be The Last Problem Or I Will Eat My Own Armstrongp  pemUnable to cast object of type SingleResult1[IntranetMVC.UserDetail] to type IntranetMVC.UserDetail.emp  pHeres the functionp  precode  Function Index As ActionResult     ViewDataMessage  Welcome to ASP.NET MVC      Dim userDetail As UserDetail     Dim office As IListOf Office     Dim activeUser As IListOf ActiveUser     Dim dept As IListOf Department      Using db As PersonnelDataContext  New PersonnelDataContext       Dim results As IMultipleResults  db.UserDetail1168        userDetail  results.GetResultOf UserDetail       office  results.GetResultOf Office       activeUser  results.GetResultOf ActiveUser       dept  results.GetResultOf Department     End Using      Return ViewNew IndexViewDatauserDetail, office, activeUser, dept   End Function codepre  pIts occurring on all of the codeuserDetail, office, activeUsercode and codedeptcode assignments, but I have no idea why.

Its not final, Ive been playing around with it.  It seems the return types arent right, but Im not sure why.

Unfortunately GetResult is the only exposed method for bringing back results, so you have to iterate over the collection and add them to a generic list.p  pThanks very muchp

Negative 543 pIve got a codeUINavigationControllercode with a series of codeUIViewControllerscode on it.  Under some circumstances, I want to pop back exactly two levels.

Negative 543 pI was wondering how people usually navigate through large projects with several source files in Linux environment.  I primarily work with C and python and sometimes with C, C and Java.p  pI wanted to know specific editors, plugins etc.  I used to program on windows so editors like vi and emacs are not really in my league, but if you think if it could be really helpful for me to learn one of these editors please suggest so and any specific plugins you use to make your life simpler with managing large projects with these programs.p  pHere are a couple of scenarios Lets say I am working on a particular function A in file F, and all of a sudden I realize that this function needs to call function B in file G.  I quickly need to navigate to that function to determine things like function parameters, take a quick look at the function etc.  Another scenario would be working on two different locations at one time in a file and switching quickly between these two locations.  p  pI am using eclipse to manage my project and do development eclipses auto completion is painfully slow and geany to edit files individually, but seems like I cant really get to that level of efficiency. p  pPlease share your code management and navigation techniques.p  pThanks,p  pedit languagesp

Negative 543 pThe a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibrarysystem.type.aspx relnofollowSystem.Typea class provides a a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibrarysystem.type.getinterfaces.aspx relnofollowGetInterfacesa method that gets all the interfaces implemented or inherited by the current Type.  The problem is that The GetInterfaces method does not return interfaces in a particular order, such as alphabetical or declaration order. Your code must not depend on the order in which interfaces are returned, because that order varies.  In my case, however, I need to isolate and expose via WCF only the leaf interfaces of the interface hierarchy, that is interfaces that are not inherited by other interfaces in that hierarchy. For example, consider the following hierarchyp  precodeinterface IA   interface IB  IA   interface IC  IB   interface ID  IB   interface IE  IA   class Foo  IC, IE  codepre  pFoos leaf interfaces are IC and IE, whereas GetInterfaces will return all 5 interfaces IA..IE.

Negative 543 pI have a server which takes some messages x and outputs some messages Y. Currently the x to y mapping is fixed. So x1 will always generate y1 with corresponding fields. p  pBut now I want to be able to make it configurable such that the users can put their own dll which will generate x1 to y2, y3, or however they want. In case if they dont handle it then it should take a default mapping which is x1 to y1.p  pOne more thing is most of my output messages y1, y2 , y3 are already existing objects which are all derived from a base class. And I want to be able to do the same thing the other way around...meaning y2incoming message to be converted to x1 depending on the user dll. Can we accomplish this using DLLs or is there a better way of doing this Is there a design patternfactory pattern or something to do this correctly so that it is flexible in future also. Thanksp

Negative 543 pI have an app where I need to dynamically choose an SQLDataSource for a GridView so I can use 1 of 2 stored procedures, depending on who is logged into the system.  p  pMy problem is that I am using logic like this, in the button click... p  precodeIf SessionSiteType  Type1 Then      GridView1.DataSourceID  SqlDataSource2 Else      GridView1.DataSourceID  SqlDataSource1 End If GridView1.DataBind codepre  pThis happens when you click the button that reveals the panel with the gridview in it. p  pThe user then makes changes basically adjusting a text box on one or more liens of the grid and then clicks save.  However, the gridview no longer knows its DataSourceID once this happens, so when I try to go through the gridviews rows  there are none. p  pIf, in the save buttons click, I put the same code, it of course blanks out any of the data changes I made in the form. p  pSo, simply put  how do I dynamically choose the SqlDataSource, but only one time, so that the program then keeps that SqlDataSourceID associated with the gridview until the end of the cycle  Is this a ViewState thing  I dont totally understand ViewState... p  pPardon my ignorance  Im assuming this is kind of simple, but I just dont have a ton of .NET experience.  If there is a better way, Id be interested in hearing that as well  that said, time is of the essence so Im kind of looking for the quick fix right now boss is breathing down my neck.. heh. p  pThanksp
Negative 543 pMy question might be very basic but still I think it worths to ask. I have the following code  p  precodeifpartialHits.getreqnr.containsKeyz  partialHits.getreqnr.getz lt tmpmap.getz       partialHits.getz.putz, tmpmap.getz    codepre  pwhere codepartialHitscode is a HashMap. What will happen if the first statement is true Will Java still check the second statement Because in order the first statement to be true, the HashMap should not contain the given key, so if the second statement is checked, I will get codeNullPointerExceptioncode.br So in simple words, if we have the following code  p  precodeifa ampamp b   ifa  b codepre  pwould Java check codebcode if codeacode is false in the first case and if codeacode is true in the second casep
Negative 543 pTo keep the long story short, I am unable to use the container from the STL and boost library and have to create my own. p  pMy own generic container is coded in VC6 and I need to know how to manually allocate memory for generic types before storing it in my own container. The generic types are all struct that can contain nested struct. All struct be it nested or not will contain only primitive types like char, int, bool etc.p  pFor example, when you call the insert function of stdvector, internally, stdvector will automatically perform a deep cloning of the generic type before storing it. p  pstrongHow can I duplicate this functionality deep cloning of generic type in my own containerstrongp  pPlease provide some sample code for performing deep cloning of generic type.p

Negative 543 pI have some code that generates XML from some tables. The tables that Im querying were generated from an XSD file the describes the XML I am supposed to be generating. The problem is that the names of the tables and fields follow a different naming convention than those in the schema  for example, an element named personID in the schema would be PRSNID in the database tables.

Since the code above depends both on codeClientBaseltIMyContractgtcode, codeIMyContractcode, it seems I was trying to synthesize a generic class that would satisfy that constraint.p  pIn retrospect, this wouldnt make sense. As an example, the codeClientBaseltIMyContractgtcode would expect to be instantiated in such a way that a codeChannelcode object would be constructed that it could then delegate the codeClosecode method to.p  pIve wound up punting on having the exact same code run both for the real and for the fake services. Im now injecting an codeIMyServicecode, and either calling codeIMyService.Methodcode or codeclient.Methodcode depending on whether my injected property is null.p

Negative 543 pIve been tasked with a implementing a system for continuously receiving large amounts of data from a partner. The data schema on the partners side is different from ours, so some transformation has to take place when the data is received and imported into our database.p  pWhats the best approach to solve this taskp  pI have some control over both sides of the equation, i.e. if we chose to use WCF, our partner will implement that service. But its important to limit the amount of programming that has to take place on the partners side as much as possible. Ideally they would use some feature of SQL Server to export their data and then let us deal with the rest.p  pOther relevant factorsp  ul liSQL Server is used on both sides 2008 at our side, unknown for the partner.li li.NET 4 andor anything that comes out of the box from Microsoft, no 3rd party products.li liTransfer is one way, i.e. from the partner to us only.li liAmount of data is around tens of thousands of updated recordsobjects transferred daily.li liThe data model is fairly complicated, with several tables and relations.li liThe solution should be tolerant to changes on the partners side we dont know when amp how they change their modelli liMaintainability and reliability are more important than performance, i.e. we dont need emtheem latest data, but the service should be easy to modify and it cant failstop.li ul  pIm asking this question because I overwhelmed but the number of ways this can be accomplished. As a .NET developer, Im leaning towards implementing WCF or maybe even some custom xmlbased exchange. But I know Biztalk would probably fit the bill here, and SQL Server probably has some nifty features built in that I dont know about.p  pAny pointers, ideas and suggestions are most welcomep

Then I have another button that does the same exact thing, but it brings me back to the first view.  And it too, works great.  I am able to navigate from one view to the other very easily.  But the only problem I have, is when I try load the second view a second time, the viewDidLoad is not called again.  I tested this by having an NSLog in the viewDidLoad method.  p  pFor my app to do what I want I need the viewDidLoad to be called again.  Im guessing maybe my view isnt fully unloaded when I switch between them.p  pAny help is greatly appreciated.  p

This stats manager is designed using templates see declaration in the pic.The StatMgr holds a map not STL that maps a string implementation to a smart pointer which is also a template, ARef. The specific subclasses of StatMgr statically declare the template class of their parent StatMgr on construction see LStatMgr and RStatMgr, and so themselves are not template classes.br This allows me to do things likep  precodeLStatMgr myLStatMgr10 ifmyLStatMgr.removeacKey    cout ltlt Remove was good ltlt endl No need to delete  codepre  pORp  precodeARefltLStatgt oLStat  NULL myLStatMgr.getNextStatacKey,oLStat ifoLStat  NULL   oLStatgtdoSomethingLStatLike codepre  pHowever that was before mister linker and madam compiler decided to join forces and thwart my attempts at progress I still have to test the functionality and memory use.br As it stands I have the following error and warning per stat classbrp  blockquote   p.StatsMgr.cpp740  warning C4661   void StatsMgrvPrint  no suitable   definition provided for explicit   template instantiation requestbr   .StatsMgr.cpp740  warning C4661   void StatsMgrvPrint  no suitable   definition provided for explicit   template instantiation requestbr   .StatsMgr.cpp104  error C2084   function StatsMgrStatsMgrconst   enum doCollect,const int already has   a bodybr .StatsMgr.cpp104  error   C2084 function StatsMgrStatsMgrconst   enum doCollect,const int already has   a bodybrp blockquote  pstrongNow regarding the warningsstrong  at line 740 there are delarations as sobrp  precodetemplate class StatsMgrltLStatgt template class StatsMgrltRStatgt codepre  pI added this because if I dont do that then I end up with a mess of linker errors see them below.

What is the difference between these two registers Can it be that esi assumes the pointer to be properly aligned and therefore brings additional performancep  pRead some assembly reference ecx is just a counter, whereas esi is the memory source. So I think STL algorithm knows that Random Access Iterator is properly aligned and therefore uses memory pointers. Where in the nonSTL version there is no speculation how the alignment is.

Negative 543 pI am at a point in my learning about solid software development where I realize that the pedaltothemedal code at light speed and pray for good results with no real plan approach does not work.p  pI am seeking to replace my old and admittedly not exactly great ways with solid practices.  I have never used unit testing before, and now on top of trying to learn pyramid which is going well thanks to the thorough documentation I am also trying to see how unit testing in general can benefit me also in the future add integration testing, regression testing, etc..  I read this intro to nosetest a hrefhttpivory.idyll.orgarticlesnoseintro.html relnofollowhttpivory.idyll.orgarticlesnoseintro.htmla, and not to be flippant I see that you can use unit tests to test regular expressions, and see codeif a1 b1 now does a  bcode.  This is all I can see at this point.  I do not need a framework for this.  I can use a regular expression tester, and common sense to test.  If Im going to use unit testing to see if two  variables are equal, then wouldnt i have to create a test every time I create a variable and set it equal to something  The examples from the article just seem kind of arbitrary.p  pMy mind is way open to learning the benefits of unit testing, but I want to know What are some practical applications of unit testing.p  pBottom line  I have never used unit testing before, so please tell me why I am wrong, and should start using testing.p  pCheersp

Negative 543 pI have the following problem  or rather, an urgent need for valuable advice  with Microsoft MVC. A certain action from the client leads to the creation ofp  ul liA remark in the table Remarksli liAn entry in the table for HourRegistrationsli liAn entry in the changelog for Ticketsli ul  pI use a service layer for business actions and repositories for CRUD actions. The problem is that I at times need to connect objects from different DataContexts so I suppose I use a flawed design. Recently we have started to remove all business logic from our controllers and repositories and this is one of the first things I run into.p  pExamplep  precodeBLogic.AddRemarksTicket t, ...    Remark r  remarksRepository.Create   r.Ticket  t   remarksRepository.Addr   remarksRepository.Save  codepre  pThis triggers kBOOM since the Ticket is fetched in the controller using the repository. So Remark r and Ticket t do not share the same data context. p  pI can alter the signature of the method and provide an int TicketId, but that doesnt feel right. Besides, I then get similar problems further down the line. p  pMy repositories are created at the constructor of the service class. Perhaps I must create them at the start of a method Even then, I must often transfer Ids instead of the true objects.p

Negative 543 pSo Im really picking up a lot of knowledge about customizations and animations. Right now Im skinning my app with custom UI elements, but Im not sure if Im doing this correctly.p  pPretty much Im creating a an xml file in my drawable folder with different button states and so forth. Then in my styles xml, I create a custom for example check box  style referencing the check box xml. Then in my layout xml I create a normal checkbox and call the check box style I made. Works great, but Im not sure if this is an efficient approachp  p2nd, Im learning animations and I feel that programming the animations in Java is easier then XML, which brings me to AlphaAnimation. Alpha animation requires two long variables. When I do AlphaAnimation1,0, it fades out fine, but I wanted to have it fade out 50 and from what Ive learned in the XML version, I can do 0.5 as 50. So I would type AlphaAnimation1,05, but obviously that doesnt work. HOw do I go about doing thatp  pThanksp

Negative 543 pI made a plot in R and I want to repeat all the commands like codeplotcode, codelegendcode or codelinecode that were carried out for this plot, with some minor changes.

Negative 543 pWere currently using CruiseControl.NET and NANT to run our build process. It works well, however, Id like to be able to make the tasks that I run for each build more granular WITHOUT creating more builds for the project.p  pFor example, as a simple example, if I have a create build where Id like to perform the following tasks  Build  Package  Deploy to QA  Build Release Notes  Send a notification to an internal systemp  pI dont necessarily want to deploy to QA every time I do a create build. Also, I dont want to build release notes and send notifications when Im just doing a QA build. I could just create more builds Create, Create for QA, Create for Release, however Id like to see if theres a build system out there that will allow me to pick and choose from a list of tasks every time I perform a build.p  pIs there anything like that out there, or can I make CC.NET work like thisp

Negative 543 precode  GH              Release Branch    ABEF     master                  CD      bug fix branch codepre  pBased on our particular needs for our project, it is quite common for the above scenario to occur.  We have our masterdev branch with some commits.  Then we get a bug report and start fixing that on the bug branch commits C and D above.  More commits happen in the dev branch in the meantime.  Next we are told we need to create a release for a customer which cannot include the changes introduced by commits B, E and F above, but it should include the bug fix.p  pSo we branch off of dev before change B was ever applied, but what is the best way to get the bug fix into this release branch too  If I perform a merge of the branch it will include the change that was made in B which I dont want.  I could perform a cherrypick of commits C and D but I read that cherry picking is not always a good idea a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions880957pullallcommitsfromabranchpushspecifiedcommitstoanother881014881014based on this answera basically because my repo would then look likep  precode  GHCD  Release Branch    ABEF      master                  CD        bug fix branch codepre  pSo C and D appear as completely new commits with different sha1 IDs as C and D.  Is this really a bad thing  What problems can this lead to  Is there a better way of getting the changes from the bug fix branch into the release branchp

Negative 543 pI have a camera which produces photographs of 3008x2000 pixels. I use Image Magick to scale and resize the photos to be put up on my website.

But the file size will be always above 250KB. More images on a single html page means the page will be heavier and loading time will be longer. Are there any features in image magic that will help me to keep the file size as small as possible, possibly, below 100KB. But the image size should be the same, that is, 602x400px.

Negative 543 pIm curious about the browser behavior when using modrewrite and a hashtag . Firefox and Chrome can rewrite a URL that has a www and remove the www while keeping the original URL, with the hashtag and fragment, no problem. Thats awesome But Safari and IE78 not sure about 9 remove the www and lose the hashtag and fragment during the rewrite. Im wondering if theres a fix using modrewrite for the Safari and IE Although, I suspect there isnt because Im asking about fragments. I have no experience with modrewrite, Ive only been reading about it and just started using the HTML5 Boilerplate .htaccess file. Ive read about how hash fragments arent ever sent to the server and if I wanted to store or use that fragment Id have to do something clientside with Javascript.p  pI can use Twitter to show an example of what Im talking about. If you use Chrome or FF and go to a hrefhttpwww.twitter.combiz relnofollowhttpwww.twitter.combiza youll get the rewrite of a hrefhttptwitter.combiz relnofollowhttptwitter.combiza no problem, perfect. But using that same URL with the www in Safari and IE78 will rewrite the URL back to the main Twitter URL, without the www but no hash and fragment, no deeplink. Its the same result for the Twitter URL that has biz  with the second  p  pIf Twitter doesnt or cant do anything about this SafariIE amp www behavior, then maybe I shouldnt sweat it either Is this a browser thing because theres no solution using modrewrite within a .htaccess file to store a hashtag fragment, right p  pSpecifically in my work, Im using SWFAddress, which uses the hashtag to deep link in Flash content, which is almost exactly like a Twitter URL, except theres no . I think Twitter is using the Making AJAX Crawlable approach. And just like Twitter, my URLs will rewrite fine in FF and Chrome, but bonk in Safari and IE 78. It doesnt seem to make a difference if the hashtag has the  or not, its still part of the fragment, nop  pI started to play around with a SWFAddress version approach of Making AJAX Crawlable back when I was looking for a solution to make the content on a Flash site crawlable, but the browsers handle the modrewrite the same way. The removal of the www works fine in FFChrome, bonk the fragment in Safari and IE. I have a working example for my SWFAddress Making AJAX Crawlable approach version had to remove the link. new users to stackoverflow only get 2 URLs per post. In the end I didnt use that approach for making my Flash content searchable, but it looks promising. I think making the HTML snapshot was more work than using PHP pages, but thats a totally different subjectquestion.p  pItd be funny if for my first stackoverflow question there was a really short answer like, Yeah, dont sweat it  p  pThanks p

Negative 543 pFirst at all I have a very concrete question, but maybe an alternative approach to my problem second part could also help me.p  pstrongIs there a way to address a character in a string via its index in mysql. i.e. in PHP var[2] will give you the 3rd charaterstrongp  pThe obvious way is codeSUBSTRINGvar, 3,1 code but since my strings are 1024 character long I assume this is not the fastest solution.

The difference is the sum of the characterwise square distances i.e. codehashDiffAA,AC656565674code. The first major performance boost could be achieved by introducing a threshold to cancel the calculation if the hashes are already to different. But since mysql is not my every day language, I stuck at this point in finding other optimizations.

Negative 543 pMy problem is the following. I am learning C by writing a graph library and want to make use of as much generic programming techniques as possible hence, answering my question through use BOOST will not help me in fact, I tried looking through BOOSTs code for an answer to my question, but it was a humbling experience, since I cant even figure out where certain functions are defined just way too high level of C for learning from it at my level.p  pThat said, my library is templated in the following wayp  precodeclass edge  ...   template ltclass edgeTgt class node  ...   template ltclass edgeT, class nodeTgt class graph  ...  codepre  pand I am creating more complex graphs by using classes derived from edge or node, so a weighted edge class would be simplyp  precodetemplate ltclass Tgt class weightededge  public edge     public      T weight     ...  codepre  pThe problem now is that I want to implement an algorithm on this structure that computes the shortest distance between two vertices.

Negative 543 pIt may be difficult to explain exactly what I want, so please let me do stepbystep.p  pOur company has longlived Java project that uses Spring WS, XSD files to generate WSDL and those beans from WSDL. Project is compiledbuilt using ANT with various targets one target to generate classes from XSD, another to generate client JAR, another to generate Server WAREAR. This project used to run SOAP server and also used to generate client side JAR. But there is no single source of code anymore and number of pregenerated client JARs are flying around. I need to clean this mess using Maven.p  pI created modular Maven project, but basically the only real child project is one that contains all the custom code, all XSDs, etc another child project simply packages EAR from the WAR generated by first project. Since this project uses Spring WS the final WSDL file is generated dynamically when run on server.p  pWhat I have managed so far is to do followingp  ul ligenerate classes from XSD manually, add those classes to the srcmainjava so that they are stored permanently, have Maven to generate the rest of Service side architecture WAREAR.li liseparately using the WSDL file imported from running server generate Client JAR file by using eclipse WTP plugin create new project, drop the WSDL into it, use WTP plugin to generate files, then export project into final JAR file and then distribute this JAR to interested parties.li ul  pThis works, but as you see the process of code maintenance has problem pregenerated classes are included into the main source, the process of generating client is at best detached from the main project. So it is a mess I would like to be able to clean up.p  pWhat I would like to be able to do is something like thisp  ul licreate Maven project that hosts XSD filesli liuse it to generate classes and Client JARli lirefer to this project from Server side project so that the generated classes can be referenced by server side codeli lithe server side project is the one that would use Spring WS and that would be able to generate EAR fileli ul  pThe issue I am facing is simple the XSD files to generate WSDL dynamically should really reside in that server project, not in client project. These files need to be in srcmainresources so they are moved to class path of built WAREAR file. I could use two different copies of XSD  one on client side project another on server side project, but it sounds wrong.p  pSo my main question really is  how do I approach this project architecture using Maven so that I only use single instance of any source file XSD, Java, etc and I am able to conveniently generate classes from XSD, build Client JAR and server WAREAR. I am OK with two or more separate build commands  one generates JAR, another generate EAR from proper project sources.p  pOh by the way  refactoring the XSD files is out of question  they are given to us and must be used AS IS.p  pThanks, Nikolayp

Negative 543 pI would like to know how to order efficiently in Rails. We all know that you can do simple ordering in Rails with the following methodsp  precode Model.ordercreatedat ASC.limit10 codepre  pIn this case Im just pulling the first 10 entries. If I wanted to add a nontime delineated ordering I could create a column in the Model eg customordering column and input values to order the objects. That case you would just modify the ordercustomordering ASC call.p  pBUT lets say I want to order based off a users predicted preference. In this case, its not feasible to create a new column because each user has different tastes. What would be a smart, efficient way to accomplish this taskp  pOne method would be to create an algorithm to predict a users rating of an object from Model called modelratingobject. This algorithm would spit out an positive integer value of their rating. If I went down this path, how would I efficiently order the Modelp  pAnother method would be to set the algorithm up as a modelentry.userpreferenceuser. Then I could order by p  precode Model.all.sort  b, a a.userpreferenceuser ltgt b.userpreferenceuser   codepre  pBut this strikes me as inefficient. It has to call all the entries in the model and then sort them which, even if you use efficient sorting methods like merge or bubble sort, gets poor performance on models with large numbers of entries.p  pAre there other paths I am not considering Can anyone point me in the right direction herep
Negative 543 pThis is a question about message passing.  This relates specifically to an inhouse application written in  C. But it has a home grown message passing system resembling erlang.  p  pOkay, we hope that it will be possible to learn from erlang folks or documentation to find an elegant solution to a couple of message passing challenges. But alas, after reading erlang documentation online and forums these topics dont seem to be addressedthat we can find.p  pSo the question is In erlang, when does the queue to send messages to a process get full  And does erlang handle the queue full situation Or are the queues for message passing in erlang boundlessthat is only limited by system memoryp  pWell in our system it involves processing a stream of financial data with potentially billions of tuples of information being read from disk, each tuple of financial information is called a tick in the financial world.p  pSo it was necessary to set a limit to the queue size of each process in our system. We arbitrarily selected 1000 items max in each queue.  Now those queues quickly get filled entirely by the tick messages.p  pThe problem is that the processes also need to send other types of messages to each other besides just ticks but the ticks fill up the queues preventing any other types of message from getting passed.p  pAs a band aid solution which is messy allow multiple queues per process for each message type. So a process will have a tick queue, and a command queue, and fill queue, and so on.p  pBut erlang seems so much cleaner by having a single queue to each process that carries  different message types.  But again, how does it deal with the the queue getting hogged by a flood of only one of the message typesp  pSo perhaps this is a question about the internals of erlang. Does erlang internally have separate limits on message types in a queue Or does it internally have a separate queue per type of messagep  pIn any case, how are sending processes aware when a queue is too full to receive certain types of message Does the send fail Does that mean  error handling becomes necessary in erlang for inability to sendp  pIn our system, it tracks when queues get full and then prevents any processes from running which will attempt to add to a full queue until that queue has more space. This avoids messy error handling logic since processes, once invoked, are guaranteed to have room to send one message.p  pBut again, if we put multiple types of messages on that same queue. Other message types will be blocked that must get through.p  pIt has become my perhaps mistaken impression that erlang wasnt designed to handle this situation so perhaps it doesnt address the problem of a queues getting filled with a flood of a single message type.p  pBut we hope someone know how to answer this point to good reference information or book that covers this specific scenario.p

Negative 543 pIm trying to behaviorally test a Java object called StringReader. The code looks something like thisp  precodepublic interface CharReader    public char readChar       public class ByteArrayCharReader implements CharReader    public ByteArrayCharReaderbyte[] bytes   public char readChar   public class StringReader    public String readStringbyte[] bytes  codepre  pThe protocolresponsibility of StringReader isp  ul liWhen readString is called, StringReader should repeatedly call CharReader.readChar to read a character from the byte array until it encounters a null termination character or a max number of characters which is 20. The idea is that StringReader shouldnt be bothered with all the integral stuff in correct unicode character decoding and such the responsibility is delegated to a CharReader.li ul  pI want to write a unit test for StringReader that expresses this protocol, but I cant seem to figure out how.p  pFirst I thought I just wanted StringReader to internally create a ByteArrayCharReader and use that on the byte array it is handed in readString but this seems to not make sense since I then wouldnt be able to mock it from the outside.p  pIt then seems I got a kind of chickenandegg problem. I want to inject a ByteArrayCharReader to StringReader, but ByteArrayCharReader must be constructed with a byte array that is only first available when readString is called  so how can I pass it if I cant constructmock it from the outside. It seems like a silly problem, because in theory I know that the byte array passed to readString actually comes from the test where ByteArrayCharReader also comes from so I do have the parameters ready out there. Maybe I have missed somethingp  pI should mention that I am working on a legacy code base and thus I cannot change the interface of StringReader.readString easily.p  pIm kind of frustrated I cant see how to work this out because it seems like a really simple scenario A is passsed an array and wants to parse the array with an ArrayParser  how to test this behaviorally not state basedp

Negative 543 pI need to add some jars from JRE7 library to my Android project. But for example codert.jarcode is in conflict with codeandroid.jarcode from Adroid 2.2 SDK, so I get this errorp  blockquote   pIlladvised or mistaken usage of a core class java. or javax.   when not building a core library.p      pThis is often due to inadvertently including a core library file   in your applications project, when using an IDE such as   Eclipse. If you are sure youre not intentionally defining a   core class, then this is the most likely explanation of whats   going on.p      pHowever, you might actually be trying to define a class in a core   namespace, the source of which you may have taken, for example,   from a nonAndroid virtual machine project. This will most   assuredly not work. At a minimum, it jeopardizes the   compatibility of your app with future versions of the platform.

Negative 543 pIm trying to implement a custom UISlider subclass of UISlider, that behaves in a similar way to the native slider that has a glow around the thumb when its highlighted. Im having trouble with this, though.p  pThe effective width of the highlighted thumb is obviously greater than the normal thumb due to the glow. If I add transparent pixel padding to the normal state image, so that both images have the same width, the issue is that the normal state thumb never looks like it reaches the end of the track it does reach the end, but the padding makes it appear otherwise.p  pIf I use thumbRectForBounds to offset the thumb to line up correctly with the beginning of the track, it only makes the issue worse at the other end.p  pIf I keep both images only as wide as they need to be ie, no padding on the normal state, and the two are not the same width, Ive gotten closer. I can set the offset independently in thumbRectForBounds based on the UIControl.state, but it seems like the theres some math magic going on behind the scenes. The only place where the UISlider thinks the images for both states line up perfectly is the exact center.p  pIt seems like I may need to implement some math that determines the offset of the highlight state based on it relative position along the track. It would need an yoffset of zero at the center the UISlider would center both images, which means they align. At the extremes, it would need a yoffset that completely makes up for the glow. And in between it would need to interpolate the yoffset.p  pThis seems like a lot of work to recreate something the native slider does though, so perhaps Im missing something obvious.p  pstrongUpdatestrong Current solutionp  pIts not entirely portable, since it makes some assumptions about the size of the glow being added. Im adding the glow with an image rather than drawing it directly to the CALayer. I havent tested how performant this is yet.p  pEssentially I create a layer thats a square whose dimensions are the height of the default state thumb image, center it over the thumb, and then draw the glow only the glow, not a separate image of a thumb with a glow, as would be done with a hightlight state image into the layer. p  precode CGRectthumbRectForBoundsCGRectbounds trackRectCGRectrect valuefloatvalue    CGRect r  [super thumbRectForBoundsbounds trackRectrect valuevalue]    [thumbHighlightOverlayLayer removeFromSuperlayer]   thumbHighlightOverlayLayer  [CALayer layer]     int x  r.origin.x  r.size.width  2  r.size.height  2   thumbHighlightOverlayLayer.frame  CGRectMakex, r.origin.y, r.size.height, r.size.height    UIImage thumbHighlightOverlayImage  [UIImage imageNamedthumbhighlight]   thumbHighlightOverlayLayer.contents  idthumbHighlightOverlayImage.CGImage    switch self.state      case UIControlStateHighlighted       [[self layer] addSublayerthumbHighlightOverlayLayer]       break     default       break       return r  codepre

Negative 543 pOk so complete rewrite of the question due to lack of replies. I want a window that is dragable but as its being dragged, alter the margin to extend as far as the old position of the window. I.e. Window moves right X, extend margin left X. Now Ive hit a few snags such as the window having its edges cut off for some reason. Heres my code, let me know if you can spot anythingp  precodeprivate void WindowLocationChangedobject sender, EventArgs e                      double TmpLeft  Math.Absthis.Left  WinLeft             double TmpTop  Math.Absthis.Top  WinTop          if this.IsLoaded         depending on whether the window is moved left, right             if this.Left gt WinLeft             depending on whether the window is moved up, down                 if this.Top gt WinTop                     bdr.Margin  new ThicknessTmpLeft, TmpTop, 0, 0                 else                     bdr.Margin  new ThicknessTmpLeft, 0, 0, TmpTop                          else                              if this.Top gt WinTop                     bdr.Margin  new Thickness0, TmpTop, TmpLeft 40, 0                 else                     bdr.Margin  new Thickness0, 0, TmpLeft, TmpTop                             private void WindowLoadedobject sender, RoutedEventArgs e                      WinLeft  this.Left             WinTop  this.Top             bdr.Height  this.ActualHeightI set these because they are auto             bdr.Width  this.ActualWidth  before the window opens          codepre  pAt the moment the whole window set window background to yellow so I can see the margin is moving, where as I want the top left corner of the margin to remain in place. Ive also noticed that the area I click on to drag the window a codebordercode tends to move around as well so is no longer under my click as I move the window. Hope thats clear, comment any further questions.p  pstrongOLD  ONLY READ TO UNDERSTAND WHAT IM TRYING TO DOstrongp  pSo Im trying to create an application that has a pop up window with a pointerline coming from the child window to a particular place in the parent window. I achieved this like sop  precodeltBorder Namebrdr Margin40,0,0,0 gt     Content ltBordergt  ltLine         NamePointer         X10         X240         Y155         Y250         StrokeThickness2         StrokeBlack gtltLinegt codepre  pNotice the 40 left codeMargincode on the border that makes the window larger than it appears so that the codePolygoncode sticks out to the left and points to the parent window If theres a bettercoolermore elegant way of doing this, Im all ears. p  pSo that worked fine but now I want the pointer to be dynamic. As in, if the child window gets dragged the pointer must scale relatively to the parent windows location. I.e. it must appear as if the two windows are attached via the line. Now my plan was to record the point the child window opens on because it opens relative to the parent window, its correct when it initialises and then use the difference between this and the new location point after dragging to find the new points that the line should be going to. My code probably says it better than I ever could...p  precode    private void WindowLocationChangedobject sender, EventArgs e              if this.IsLoaded                      brdr.Margin  new ThicknessMath.Absthis.Left  WinLeft  40, Math.Absthis.Top  WinTop, 0, 0             Pointer.X1  Math.Absthis.Left  WinLeft             Pointer.Y1  Math.Absthis.Top  WinTop  55             Pointer.X2  Math.Absthis.Left  WinLeft  40             Pointer.Y2  Math.Absthis.Top  WinTop  50                    private void WindowLoadedobject sender, RoutedEventArgs e              WinLeft  this.Left         WinTop  this.Top      codepre  pAs you can see I have to set the window margin so that it extends to the old position. Then I reset the codeLinecode coords to the new values. All these values are calculated, like I said, by comparing the opening window coords to the current coords.p  pMy problem is, this isnt right. Would be very impressed to see someone able to figure this out.p

Negative 543 pI am trying to use the compability APIs android.support.v4.app I have downloaded them and am now trying to use them in my project as described here a hrefhttpdeveloper.android.comtoolsextrassupportlibrary.html relnofollowhttpdeveloper.android.comtoolsextrassupportlibrary.htmla, i.e. copying the libraries to my project libs folder then right clicking on the files and add to build path. However, eclipse seems oblivious to this, it does not recognise, in my example FragmentActivity whereas it is defined in the FragmentActivity.jar I have just added to my build path, furthermore, in the statement import android.support.v4.app.FragmentActivity, android.support is still underlined in red. I have tried cleaning my project, restarting eclipse and my mac many times to no avail. I am using MAC OSX Lion  indigor20 Oh and adding the libraries one by one to my code tree is neither neat nor practical as it leads to conflicts. TIAp
Negative 543 pIm working on a Data Asset Manager and one functionality is obviously file handling. Ive established a list of prerequisites for this system and was wondering if some were perhaps redundant. File handling will be done by a PHP script running a shell command either codecpcode codemvcode or codermcode.p  ol liNeed to movedeletecopy file asynchronously.li liNeed to check integrity after movecopy e.g. using file md5 hash.li liNeeds to handle multiple users handling same files at the same time with proper locks and such.li ol  pWhat Ive been wondering is, how much of this is already handled by linux codecpcodecodemvcodecodermcode commands. Provided point 1 isnt a necessity, are points 2 and 3 already handled by the commands Is checking the output and redirecting it to the user all I have to do If thats the case I could probably make a daemon to do 1 while still getting the output from the commands.p  pAny help would be appreciated.p

Negative 543 pI have an application that is very imageintense, and Im finding that Im running into alot of OutOfMemory issues when loading up multiple activities.p  pThe activities are all gridviews or listviews of bitmaps, and clicking on an image takes you to another activity that contains another set of images sort of like an album of albums of albums of albums. The first 3 activities run fine, but when navigating further down, I start running into some serious OutOfMemory Errors.p  pAfter doing a stack dump with DDMS, it appears that the GridViews and Listviews of the previous activities are hogging all the memory. This is kind of expected, since they are showing lots of bitmaps themselves, but Im not sure how the VM goes about freeing activities in the stack, and if they do it even when you havnt called finish on them.p  pDo Activities recylce their views when they go into the background and then restore them when you navigate back to the activity, or is clearing the imageviews in my gridviews and listviews this something I need to handle manually on the activities onPause and onResume when navigating away from the activity in the lifecycle functionsp

Negative 543 pIm working on an SSIS package which uses a for each loop to iterate through excel files in a directory and a data flow task to import them.p  pThe issue Im having is that the project manager Im working with doesnt think the users will always follow the structure.

Even though I have the task set to not fail the package the package does indeed fail and then the other files arent imported.p  pSo, Im wondering what is the easiest way to either determine the spreadsheet is incorrectly formatted, or stop the error from failing the package execution  After taking said step I would just use a file copy task to move the file to a Failure folder.  Then continue on processing the spreadsheets.p

Negative 543 pI am pretty new to iOS and iOS development and I need to accomplish a rather complicated task for me. The app I am working on has a main view, from where the user must be able to move to three different views by clicking three different buttons. These views will have their own subview hierarchies but this is not my goal for now. For now, I am working to accomplish this subtask. I have read most of the basic tutorials about iPhone development and learned that the class codeUINavigationControllercode is responsible for traversing in the view hierarchy. As far as I can see from the tutorials, codeUINavigationControllercode provides a navigation bar but this provides a transition just to a single view. My first question is how can I build a custom navigation system, should I subclass and somehow modify codeUINavigationControllercode or is an another method possible This may be a very simple question but there are tons of materials out there which only confuses me further.p

Negative 543 pArticles on image compression often focus on generating the best possible image quality PSNR given a fixed compression ratio.  Im curious about getting the best possible compression ratio given a maximum permissible perpixel error.  My instinct is to greedily remove the smallest coefficients in the transformed data, keep track of the error Ive caused, until I cant remove any more without passing the maximum error.  But I cant find any papers to confirm it.  Can anyone point me to a reference about this problemp  hr  h2edith2  pLet me give some more details.  Im trying to compress depth images from 3D scanners, not regular images.  Color is not a factor.  Depth images tend to have large smooth patches, but accurate discontinuities are important.  Some pixels will be empty  outside the scanners range or low confidence level  and not require compression.p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comHRX1n.jpg altenter image description herep  pThe algorithm will need to run fast  optimally at 30 fps like the Microsoft Kinect, or at least somewhere in the 100 millisecond area.  The algorithm will be included in a library I distribute.  I prefer to minimize dependencies, so compression schemes that I can implement myself in a reasonably small amount of code are preferable.p

Negative 543 pI am looking to transmit audio in realtime from an Android application I am working on to a server in a way similar to how a baby monitor functions one way listening.p  pI created a test app that uses SIP to initiate a VOIP call between our client and server applications. The problem is that now I need a way to do this on nonSIP enabled devices. I have tried recording the audio from the device microphone into a buffer, then sending the buffer in chunks to the server through HTTP objects and reassembling the audio for playback with poor results.p  pDoes anyone have any suggestions for streaming realtime audio from an Android device to a server application for processing SIP works so well, but I dont have time to implement a SIP stack on all of our non supported devices.p

Negative 543 pI am trying to create a JavaScript library of UI components that are commonly used by the projects in my group.

Now I want to add some data to the component, so I call the following function.p  precodecomponent.addObjectsomeObject codepre  pBut instead of calling the function like I expect it to, it says that the component object does not have a property addObject.

Negative 543 pI am using the Eclipse IDE to create an Android application compliant with Android 2.2 and higher.  I refactored the name of one of my main activities.  My basic structure is that I have a pseudo home page activity in which other apps actually activities inside this one app have icons that lead to their respective activity.  I had a class that was originally the head activity for one of these branches in the app, call it Activity.java.  Activity.java ended up just pointing to ActivityHome.java and no longer did anything so I decided to get rid of it.

Completely cleaning and rebuilding before every attempt to launch.  Kept getting the error even though I checked the CLASSPATH and that the .class file was being named correctly.  Eventually I read that someone, though they dont know why this worked, fixed a similar problem by deleting and remaking the file.  I did that.p  pThat seems to have worked, but I dont know why and now every file deeper then ActivityHome.java eg. there is an activity called by it ActivityCamera.java is having the same issue.p  pI obviously do not want to have to delete and remake all of the .java files and even if that fixes the issue I would still like to know WHY this is happening not just HOW TO FIX it.p  pEDIT 1 Forgot to mention that I already checked the Manifest file for inconsistencies.  The issue is now happening on a class that I did not even rename. Could be part of the automated refactor renaming pure speculationp  pEDIT 2 Issue with SherlockListActivity.

Negative 543 pIve got an issue getting a method to read a file, then converting it to an integer. Here is a brief explanation of the program. It is essentially a car dealership inventory that keeps track of the vehicles in the lot by keeping them written down in a text file. When the program starts it will need to read the file and put all the current cars into an array so they can be displayed. Then the rest of the program will do other things like remove cars and add news ones etc. The part I am at is when the program first starts it needs to read the file, but I cant seem to get it to work.p  pThe text file consists of 6 lines in total 4 numbers first then 2 words respectively. I want the method to read the first four lines and convert those into integers and store them in a temporary array. Then after that it will read the next two lines and store those in a temporary array as well. Afterwards I take all these stored values and send them to a constructor. The constructor is then stored in an Arraylist and the Arraylist can be accessed anytime. In the output it does all of this just fine. But it wants to run through the method a second time despite barriers in place to prevent this.p  pHere is the code. Its a class and not the main program. I will try to explain the program as best I can inside the code.p  precodepublic class Vehicle       All the different private variables for the constructors and methods     private int intholder[], year, type, kilometres, price, loop     private String make, model, myline, holder[]       The Arraylist that the different vehicle objects will be stored     ArrayListltVehiclegt allCars  new ArrayListltVehiclegt      The Default constructor     public Vehicle         make  Vehicle Make         model  Vehicle Model         type  0         year  0         kilometres  0         price  0           The constructor that has information sent to it     public Vehicleint type, int year, int kilometres, int price, String make, String model         make  make         model  model         type  type         year  year         kilometres  kilometres         price  price          Text file information           CAR TYPE CODE      1  Sedan      2  Truck      3  Crossover      4  SUV      5  Sports            There is a total of 6 lines for each car and are as follows      1  int Type integer      2  int Year      3  int Kilometres      4  int Asking price      5  String Make      6  String Model           The method in question. It reads through the file, converts the integers and stores them,      stores the strings, and sends all the information to the constructor     public void readCarsthrows IOException         BufferedReader readFile  new BufferedReadernew FileReaderCUsersDavidDesktopFinalProjectCarlot.txt          Setting the length of the temporary arrays         holder  new String[2]         intholder  new int[4]          The main loop in the method.          do              Read the first 4 lines of the file and convert them to integers.              The try catch shouldnt have to be there because the first 4 lines              of the file are all numbers, but I put it in there to see when it was messing up.             forint i  0 i lt 4 i                 myline  readFile.readLine                 try                     intholder[i]  Integer.parseIntmyline                                  catchNumberFormatException e                     System.out.printlne                                   Had this in here to see how many lines down the file it would go before messing up.

At the end of the dowhile, it checks if myline is null. And because the last time it read the file it was still a String the loop continues. The last time it goes through the loop, everything is null so trying to convert the integer is impossible so I get errors. But I have no idea how to get it to read the file at the end of the loop without going to the next line. Here is what the text file looks like.p  precode1 2007 150250 5000 Toyota Corolla 2 2005 240400 4500 Chevorlet Silverado codepre  pI cant have it read at the end of the loop because if it does and there are still more cars after the one I just did, It goes into the next line when the loop restarts everything is thrown off. p  pAny help is appreciated, Thanksp

Negative 543 pI am curious as to why codesockaddrcode is used inside codepcapaddrtcode which is given to you when calling codepcapfindalldevscode. The reason this is not so straight forward is because codesockaddrincode contains information about the address strongandstrong port. This is similar to .NETs codeSystem.Net.IPEndPointcode class.p  pIf we were looking at a .NET library, I would not expect to see a property such as that with a description about addresses belonging to a device. As far as I know, no protocols define an address and port when describing a device on a system.p  pOn all of my devices IPv4 and IPv6 only, the port is 0.p  pWhen would it be beneficial to associate an address and port to a device as one of its owned endpoints The reason I ask is because I am developing a C binding for libpcap and want to know if it would be useful or just erroneoussilly to expose all of the data from codesockaddrincode to the user in the form of a codeSystem.Net.IPEndPointcode property on my codeNetworkDeviceAddresscode class which describes the addresses owned by a particular device.p

I have a data set in the same structure as they use ID, choice set, alternative, independent variables, and choice variable.

Negative 543 pSo, I have a map, that I want to be able to draw rectangles on to highlight an area.  When the mouse is released a permanent rectangle is drawn on the map that persists until the mouse is dragged again to start the creation of a new rectangle.  While the mouse is being dragged the rectangle outline should be created as it goes along.  p  pThe persisting rectangle is removed when the mouse is reclicked which given the application would mean that a new drag event would be started.p  pWhat happens is that the first rectangle is painted correctly and everything is fine, but subsequent rectangles that are currently being dragged have the corner cut off image link at bottom.p  pIf I click and then wait for the image to repaint before I start dragging then this problem does not exist, as well as if I sleep the thread before beginning to draw the rectangle in onMouseDragged so that it has time to repaint.p  pId like a more elegant solution than those to allow the screen to repaint before the rectangle created in onMouseDragged is shown on the screen.  So what is the best way to get the repaint to complete without zapping part of the drawn rectanglep  pNote that despite the look of the outline, the persisting rectangle that gets drawn is correct.p  pThis is what the rectangle looks like img srchttpi.imgur.comGQlpwyq.png altthe weird rectanglep  precodepublic void onMousePressedMapMouseEvent ev              startPos  new Pointev.getPoint     drawer.removeDrawingspane.getMapContent     pane.repaint     pane.setIgnoreRepainttrue           public void onMouseDraggedMapMouseEvent ev      super.onMouseDraggedev     if enabled          ensureGraphics         if dragged                       because were in XOR mode, this has the effect of erases the previous rectangle             graphics.drawRectrect.x, rect.y, rect.width, rect.height                  else                             rect.setFrameFromDiagonalstartPos, ev.getPoint         graphics.drawRectrect.x, rect.y, rect.width, rect.height         dragged  true        public void onMouseReleasedMapMouseEvent ev      super.onMouseReleasedev     if dragged          ensureGraphics         dragged  false                     drawer drawable  new drawer         drawable.drawRectangleGraphics2D parentComponent.getGraphics.create, rect.x, rect.y, rect.width, rect.height, pane.getMapContent          graphics.dispose         graphics  null         pane.setIgnoreRepaintfalse                    pane.repaint        codepre

If its better to use 3 while loops, please let me know, what I tried is below.p  precodeI run the 3 queries and store them in the given variables resultmenssenior  mysqliquerylink,getmensseniorquery resultmensinter  mysqliquerylink,getmensinterquery resultladies mysqliquerylink, getladiesquery  I want to create 1 while loop so based of the results returned from the 3  queries so based on the results returned from the 3 queries,  I get the max number of times I want the query to run ladiesboundary  mysqlinumrowsresultladies mensseniorboundary  mysqlinumrowsresultmenssenior mensinterboundary  mysqlinumrowsresultmensinter maxsize  maxarrayladiesboundary,mensseniorboundary,mensinterboundary  set an index to start from 0 index  0  I will only show the example for 1 of the arrays but you get an idea that this issue will occur for all while index lt maxsize  first, everytime the loop is entered, we need the next row to be fetched      standingsmenintertable  mysqlifetchassocresultmensinter     standingsladiestable  mysqlifetchassocresultladies  there is a high chance that the other two tables return a different row size so its best to check that we do not go beyond ifindex lt mensseniorboundary                  we fetch the rows every time we enter the block             standingsmenseniortable  mysqlifetchassocresultmenssenior              then, this is how I attempt at creating the 2 dimensional array         arraypushstandingsmensenior, array         standingsmenseniortable[teamname],         standingsmenseniortable[played],         standingsmenseniortable[won],         standingsmenseniortable[drawn],         standingsmenseniortable[lost],         standingsmenseniortable[for],         standingsmenseniortable[against],         standingsmenseniortable[points]       incrementing index each time the loop runs index   codepre  pThen finally, I just want to print what I think is the array but get this, attached image, hope you can see it clearly img srchttpi.stack.imgur.combmoFv.jpg altenter image description herep  pJust to investigate even further, every time, the if block is entered, I just commented everything out and just put this to see what was being returnedp  precodeifindex lt mensseniorboundary      printrmysqlifetchassocresultmenssenior  codepre  pThe output I got was almost 90 what I needp  precodeArray  [teamname] gt Morley Gaels [played] gt 8 [won] gt 6 [drawn] gt 2  [lost] gt 0 [for] gt 110 [against] gt 83 [points] gt 14   Array  [teamname] gt Southern Districts [played] gt 8 [won] gt 3 [drawn] gt 2  [lost] gt 3 [for] gt 104 [against] gt 98 [points] gt 8   Array  [teamname] gt St Finbarrs [played] gt 8 [won] gt 3 [drawn] gt 2  [lost] gt 3 [for] gt 107 [against] gt 99 [points] gt 8   Array  [teamname] gt Western Shamrocks [played] gt 8 [won] gt 3 [drawn] gt 0  [lost] gt 5 [for] gt 96 [against] gt 88 [points] gt 6   Array  [teamname] gt Greenwood [played] gt 8 [won] gt 1 [drawn] gt 1  [lost] gt 9 [for] gt 82 [against] gt 109 [points] gt 3  codepre  pWhat I need is for examplep  precodeArray0gtArray  [teamname] gt Morley Gaels [played] gt 8 [won] gt 6 [drawn] gt 2  [lost] gt 0 [for] gt 110 [against] gt 83 [points] gt 14  1gtArray [teamname] gt Southern Districts [played] gt 8 [won] gt 3 [drawn] gt 2  [lost] gt 3 [for] gt 104 [against] gt 98 [points] gt 8 ..... so on codepre  pMy questions arep  ul liWhat is wrong with my code and what is the correct way to dynamically create multidimensional arrays in php  ul liIs there something I have not understood about how mysqlfetchassoc works and how it returns li liAnything to improve, anything I am doing wrong li ulli ul  pI appreciate your time, than you for reading it, I tried to be as detailed as I can about what I have tried. p  pThank You.p

Negative 543 pstrongShort Versionstrongp  pHow do you collect the results of a complicated operation that is spread over several objectsp  pstrongLong Versionstrongp  pI am developing a data exchange system that will push customer orders from one system to another system.  This will be done via an API and unfortunately this require 12 individual steps to be completed successfully in sequence before an order can be reported as successfully transferred.p  pAlthough each step can and has been broken down into individual units of code, each step HAS to be completed in sequence and some steps depend on the result from previous steps.p  pIs there a suitable design pattern or combination of patterns that fit well for this particular problem If each step is dependant on the previous step then whats the best way to make it aware of the previous steps result.p  pI was thinking of a CompositeMacro Command design or perhaps modelling the OrderPush process as a Finite State Machine although I was hoping to keep it more simple.p  pThis is a question about system design so there is no need to go into detail on what the API is or how it works and Im only expecting to be pointed in the right direction.p  pThe process is to read relevant data from a local system and push to a remote system via XMLRPC.p  pThe steps arep  ul liCreate Customerli liCreate Order header recordli liCreate Order Linesli liConfirm Order this creates an invoiceli liFind Invoiceli liConfirm Invoiceli liCreate Paymentli liFind Journal Item Journal item relates to the invoice so that the payment line can be tied to the invoiceli liCreate Payment Lineli liConfirm Paymentli ul  pEach step is a single XMLRPC call that will either succeed or fail.  And this is the crux of it.  If the customer failed to be created then none of the other steps will work.  Similarly if the order failed to be created then the other steps will either fail or not be able to tie together i.e. I should obviously stop execution if any previous step fails.p  pSo has anyone got any tipsp

Negative 543 pI have 3 questions and I would appreciate it if someone can explain it to me.p  pFirst of all,p  pCan an object belong to a class be assigned to a variable of a type that is a subclass without casting If the answer is yes is casting required when assigning the object to a superclass or did I just flipped them overp  pSecondly, is it right that in an interface a method with a single parameter can accept as the argument value for that parameter objects from many different classes that are not related by inheritance I will say yes to this question because the interface can be extended by different classes but Im not sure if thats correct.p  pFinally, are methods inside a public class automatically defined public or is it suppose to be defined as packagep

Negative 543 pI am working on a javaFX project where user simply browse few files, create a queue of       it, click on start upload and upload started of these files on a specified path. Now when user click on pause button, the upload process must be paused and when click on resume, the process must be started again from the point where it has been paused. So, till now, I have created a queue of Objects Files via Executors.newSingleThreadExecutor and submitted the task. In my case taks class is know as Item.  Now, when user click on pause button, I call shutdownnow method of executorService. and when user clicks on resume, I create a whole new instance of Executorservice. But, when I submit the job via executor.execute method, it skips the current task and     resume the next task and so on. So, I need it to be start from the task which it was executing last.

   codepre  pSorry for my english, but let me try to explain,  In the above code, their are two methods STARTUPLOAD and STOPUPLOAD, these two methods are called on click of javafx buttons, so when I first click on startupload button, it starts uploading files in clientUploadInfo.getKEY hasMap, which I maintain on click on add files button, I have not mentioned the code to make it shorter,Item class carries all details. On click on stop upload button, stopUpload method get called, on click on start upload button again, the startUpload method get called but to resume the upload process,remember in my case it resume the upload but from next item, it leaves the current item as it was while clicked on Stop button. Any help would be appreciated . Thanks in advance.p
Negative 543 pI have a question that I am trying to answer for a class I am taking yes this is a homework question  an extra credit one but I do not want someone to simply give me the answer. I would much prefer someone to gently point me in the right direction to what I should or shouldnt be doing to solve this.p  pThis class is my first exposure to Java, so if my code and understanding comes across as terrible that would be why, so I apologize in advance.p  pThe problemp  pI need to create an array 3 rows by 5 columns by 3 sets. My out put would resemblep  pSet 1p  p0  1  2  3  4   p  p5  6  7  8  9 p  p10  11 12  13  14p  pSet 2p  p15 16 17 18 19p  p20 21 22 23 24p  petc, etc.p  pThe code I was able to figure out so far produces the range I need for the 3 sets as a whole, 044, but I am not sure how to format these so it looks like the above. When I run the code I just have one long list going from 044.p  pCould anyone point me in the right direction as to what I should be doing to break this lists into the rowscolumns I need to without simply handing me the answer I want to be able to say that I figured it out on my own, just had to ask for a little direction to get there.p  pThanks in advance to whomever might answer this.p  pMy codep  precodepublic static void mainString[] args       int list[][][]  new int [3][5][3] create rows, column, units buildings array structure.     int i,j,k assign variables for row, column and unit building.     int ctr  0 set counter.      create array     for i0 ilt3 i     for j0 jlt5 j     for k0 klt3 k          list[i][j][k]  ctr       for i0 ilt3 i     for j0 jlt5 j     for k0 klt3 k      Format array          System.out.printlnlist[i][j][k]     codepre  pp  pstrongEDITstrongp  pSo some progress here thanks to everyones suggestions. I am able to format this in the overall way needed of 5 columns of data. I realized fumbling through this that my set up for the original int list [] [] [] was incorrect, which is why I was having problems with this formatting the way I needed it to correctly column and row counts. p  pThe next question I would have, if I can ask, would be how I would go about inserting the Set X text where needed I was able to figure out the Set 1 placement, but I would like to now have the words Set 2 appear before the row which begins with 15 and the words Set 3 before the row which starts with 30. p  pWould I want to create separate loops for each of the value ranges that each Set X chunk would be range wise and then just label them accordingly possiblyp  pMy revised code at this point is as below and hopefully formatted nicer than before. Again, not looking for anyone to hand me an answer, just hoping to get some direction on what to look for in order to figure this out.p  pThanksp  precodepublic class ECThreeD   public static void mainString[] args       int list[][][]  new int[3][3][5]  create rows, column, units                                          buildings array structure.     int i, j, k  assign variables for row, column and unit building.     int ctr  0  set counter.       create array     for i  0 i lt 3 i          for j  0 j lt 3 j              for k  0 k lt 5 k                  list[i][j][k]  ctr                                System.out.printlnSet 1      for i  0 i lt 3 i          for j  0 j lt 3 j              for k  0 k lt 5 k                   Format array                 System.out.printlist[i][j][k]                             System.out.println                codepre  pp

Likewise, my RDS instance never peaks over 20 CPU usage.p  pUnless Im unregistered user hitting a Varnish cached page, then it loads lightning quick.p  pSo Im not exactly sure what I can be doing to try and troubleshoot the problem.

Negative 543 pAt the moment, Im migrating a site, and due to time constraints, weve migrated most to a CMS Drupal, but still have some flat HTML sub sites that need to get served outside of this.p  pNow, config wise, Ive setup Apache to pass requests for files that do exist and get served directly, rather than sending the request to the CMSp  precodeRewriteCond REQUESTFILENAME f RewriteCond REQUESTFILENAME d RewriteRule  index.php [L] codepre  pAs we get more time, the team would like to slowly import the pages weve left out of the CMS from the file system, but we dont have the ability to easily delete those additional files from the file system once weve imported them to Drupal service provider deploy method unfortunately  so not changable.p  pWere using the same URLs as the old site maintaining legacy linksaddresses and all that, so once weve recreated the page in the CMS, the above rewrite rule is still going to serve the page from the file system.p  pWhat I would like to do to get around this, is route all requests through Drupal using modrewrite, then if Drupal throws a 404, attempt to pull the URL from the file system, rather than what we have currently, which is if the file exists, serve that automatically. From a day or so of searching, I cant find a way of achieving this, cant even really find a lot of people having run into this issue before actually.p  pNaturally, if I had full control over our environment, it would be easy to just delete the underlying files once theyve been migrated, but thats not so simple in this case.p  pI also understand doing this will incur an overhead, but given this will only apply for a small part of the site, Ill be evaluating any solutions to see whether it is an acceptable compromise.p  pAny thoughtsp

Negative 543 pIs there no way to access a Model instance as an object as opposed to as an array within a Model method in CakePHP As a supersimplified example, my instinct tells me it ought to be possible to do something like thisp  precodeBird.php ... public function specialName      name  thisgtname     return Oh wow Its .name  codepre  pIf I call this method from my BirdController.php like sop  precodepublic function viewid      if id          throw new NotFoundExceptionInvalid bird           thisgtBirdgtid  id     thisgtsetresults, thisgtBirdgtspecialName   codepre  p... then it displays in the view file as Oh wow Its Bird rather than Oh wow Its Freddy i.e. the name of the model, not the name of the model instance.p  pIve tried variations on this general approach, to no avail.  It seems I must access the information via an array, like sop  precodeBird.php ... public function specialNameid      data  thisgtfindByIdid     name  data[Bird][name]     return Oh wow Its .name  codepre  pThis seems WAY overcomplicated to me.  What am I missing  Ultimately I want to be able to access dependent models in my model function, e.g. get all of the associated BirdSubspecies.  It seems like this would be much easier to do working with objects.p
Negative 543 pI have an unsorted codeListltWordCountgtcodep  precodeclass WordCount  string word int count  codepre  pAnd now I must display the top 20 items in descending order of count. How could I code this efficiently Currently I would set a minimum integer of 1 all codecountcode  1 and do a for loop of 20 iterations with a foreach loop inside.  This is an issue though because the last few elements in the codeListcode could have codecountcode of 1 while the top few may have an element with codecountcode 1 so now I am stuck on the pseudocode for this implementation for displaying them in order. p  pI CANNOT use LINQ or any other things other than the methods for codeListcode class. I personally think I must accomplish this feat using codeSortcode and codeCompareTocode somehow. This is meant to be a brain twister and that is the reason why it has to be done using the given restriction.p
Negative 543 pWe have a Oracle 10g and most of our applications are running Oracle Forms 6i.

Where can I read more about the origin of this codecode and why it was invented specifically to Oraclep

Negative 543 pCan I define a emvariadic template functionem not with a changing type, but just for a single one If my goal is to define a function that only adds a variadic number of codeintcode, but not float, or anything else, can I do that with a codetemplateltint....gtcode syntax somehowp  pThe multitype sample I can put together easilyp  precodeint add  return 0   templatelttypename T, typename...

Negative 543 pIm just learning ASP.NET using VB 2010, and although Ive had a lot of good progress, I am stumped by one issue that I cant resolve. Ive also the web for answers, but I havent found anything that is exactly what I am dealing with. ...though I may not be using the correct search terms.p  pAnyway, this is an app that will run on our company internet site which requires users to enter information into text boxes and click a button to accept it. Then it will show a modal popup asking the user to confirm. The popup has a Confirm button and a Cancel Button. The cancel button works immediately hides the confirmation popup, but the confirm button hangs up for several seconds before it moves to the next step, which is a modal Thank You popup. The Confirm button writes data to a database.p  pNow, thats how it works inside the development environment. However, when its on the production server, it will sit there for whoknowshowlong before it does anything. I can tell that it is writing to the database, and then displaying the data on the page, but the Confirmation popup stays up, and the Thank You popup never shows up. Also, the app is supposed to send an email to the user as acknowledgement, but it doesnt do that.  p  pWhen it hangs up like this, I have never waited long enough to see when it catches up. And when its live like that, I dont know of a way to debug it.p  pMore info about the page There are several update panels, one that responds to a timer tick every second to update fields on the page.

The problem is i cant see the tab bar, but only the 1st tab opened by default.p  pwhile implemeting navigation drawer i also added support library 7 to get supoort actionbar,  my best guess is that the tabbar is hidden behind the supportactionbar i get from support library, my minimum SDK is 2.3.3. thats why i am going to that much trouble, any help on how to place the tab bar below the action bar.p  palso now after doing this my drawer is not working anymore, i just keep clicking on it, and its not opening up, any idea why  please ask if you require any clarification. p

Negative 543 pIm currently learning EmberJS as I feel single page apps using a JS framework and consuming a backend API are the way things are going to be moving. Ive recently learned Laravel without any particular problem, but Im finding Ember remarkably difficult.p  pMost of my issues Ive worked through, but Im having one that I dont even know how to debug.p  pEssentially, my interface displays a list of clients. Clicking on a name goes to that client. All of this is connected to a PHPLaravel based API, which is working entirely fine and in the right format. Data is not the problem here.p  pThat said, I should point out that my data does not have an id strictly, but connects using something more like a guid 912ec803b2 instead of 231. The API is built to handle that, and its a requirement. It also means there is no id in the data, but there is a hash which may potentially be confusing ember in some wayp  pThis basic functionality just doesnt seem to work correctly. When a user clicks the Client link, it does navigate to the client. But its adding a blank row to the clients list page, then going to the client page. Returning to the clients page shows the extra blank row, and the same thing will recur if clicked again.p  pChecking the Ember inspector in Chrome shows the data collection increasing, with blank data being added. Im not sure why.p  pIve posted the code here. This should be all thats necessary. Is this behaviour a common trap for young players, of have I done something unusualp  pApologies for the length, just didnt want to omit something relevant.p  precode app.js  App  Ember.Application.create   LOGTRANSITIONS true   App.Router.mapfunction       this.resourceclients, function          this.routenew           this.resourceclient,  path clientsclienthash , function           App.Store  DS.Store.extend     url httpmyclientinfo   App.ApplicationAdapter  DS.RESTAdapter.extend   namespace api   App.Client  DS.Model.extend     name DS.attrstring,     hash DS.attrstring   App.ClientsRoute  Ember.Route.extend   model function     return this.store.findclient      App.ClientIndexRoute  Ember.Route.extend   model functionparams     return this.store.findclient, params.clienthash        templates      ltscript typetextxhandlebarsgt      ltdiv classcontainergt        ltul classnav navpillsgt         ltligtlinkto clientsClientslinktoltligt       ltulgt         outlet         ltdivgt     ltscriptgt     ltscript typetextxhandlebars idclientgt   client outer   outlet   ltscriptgt     ltscript typetextxhandlebars idclientsgt   client outer   outlet   ltscriptgt     ltscript typetextxhandlebars idclientindexgt   client index   lth1gtnamelth1gt   ltscriptgt      ltscript typetextxhandlebars idclientsindexgt    ltdiv classrowgt   ltdiv classcolmd12 collg12gt   lth1gtAll Clientslth1gt   ltdivgt   ltdivgt    ltdiv classrowgtltdiv classcolmd12 collg12gt   linkto clients.new classbtn btninfo addbtn   lti classfa faplusgt Add new clientltigt   linkto   ltdivgtltdivgt    ltdiv classrowgt   ltdiv classcolmd12 collg12gt      lttable classtable tablestripedgt       lttheadgt         lttrgt           ltthgtNameltthgt         lttrgt       lttheadgt        lttbodygt        each item in model       lttrgt         lttdgtlinkto client item.hashitem.namelinktolttdgt        lttrgt       each        lttbodygt     lttablegt       ltdivgt     ltdivgt     ltscriptgt codepre

Negative 543 pMy unit tests are running in node.js using mocha, chai, and sinon.  The code Im testing is meant to be run in a browser.p  pSome of the code defines things globally while other code expects there to be a codewindowcode object and it adds objects to codewindowcode.

The problem comes in when I want to tear down my fake environment for the next set of tests.p  pIve tried doing my coderequirecode calls in the codebeforecode or codebeforeEachcode functions and Ive tried manually deleting the created objects in the codeaftercode or codeafterEachcode functions.  One of two things happens each time. Either the global objects persist from one test JS file to the next or the global object are mysteriously absent for all the tests.p  pIm not sure if this has to do with the way mocha runs the test JS files or how coderequirecode works, but Im out of ideas.

Negative 543 pIm interested in understanding more about using a SQL View vs. a local query in MS Access. I like the fact that a view is basically a query that is stored on the server, and local machines running Access see it as a table.p  pDue to performance reasons, Ill sometimes take a view over a query since it typically makes a form load a lot faster. However, Ive run into issues where I cant update the view if I make changes in two different fields that are in different base tables. Even if the view is constructed correctly with the correct joins, etc.p  pJust wondering if there is a more efficient and proper way to construct a query that can be updated.p

The software should be able to run on android devices and windows phone 6.1 devices especifically the CN50 intermec portable computer. The last part is relevant because that means i cant use the simplistic way of XML signing that the .NET framework provides Im looking at you, System.Security.Cryptography.Xml library. So, unable to use the mentioned library i tried to sign the document by hand.

The canonicalization part doesnt worry me since, like I say, the document will be created by be, and such i will take precautions to not introduce elements that could potentially ruin the hashing calculation part.

So, I have a unsigned and a correctly signed document obtained from two sources  C and XMLSEC, from there i know the correct SHA1 Hash value of the document called DigestValue and the correct signature called SignatureValue. I have something to compare to. Like i said, i tried to do the canonicalization in Java, but could get the hash correctly so, instead of banging my head to the head hoping to find some sort of illumination as to how im messing this up, i simply decide to assume the input document strongwill be canonnicalizedstrong. And if someone says thats impossible because the line breaks will change with canonicalization i simply would reply strongmy input file wont have any line breaksstrong. Once again, the document will be created by me. Following that approach, i can get the correct digest value of the unsigned document with the following codeemp  pJAVAp  precode   Generates SHA1 digest of the provided data.     param data the data

And thats where i cant find a solution. By the way, the signature is valid if I validate it as a string with the corresponding public key or certificate... the error arises when i attach the signature node to the original document and validate it as an XMLDSIG. The signature takes basically three inputs Bytes to be signed Private Key Algorith The key and the algorith are ok i think, the problem then needs to be in the bytes being signed, however i cant find what Im doing wrong.

Negative 543 pI have a codeUIScrollViewcode and I would like it to only zoom bounce codeUIScrollView.bouncesZoomcode when zooming stronginstrong. If the user tries to zoom strongoutstrong past the emminimumZoomScaleem there is no bouncing animation, however when zooming stronginstrong there is. The codeUIScrollView.bouncesZoomcode property only allows for emtruefalseem, which applies to both zooming in and out. In an ideal scenario, I would like to have something resembling br codeUIScrollView.bouncesZoom.forMinimumZoomScale  falsecode br codeUIScrollView.bouncesZoom.forMaximumZoomScale  truecode br The reason for this is so a user cannot zoom out to the point where they can see white space around the view, as this degrades from the aesthetics of my application. br Please let me know if you have any further questions.

Negative 543 pI had an interview for a Jr. developer position a few days ago, and they asked p  pIf you had an array of letters a and b how would you write a method to count how many instances of those letters are in the arrayp  pI said that you would have a codefor loopcode with an codeif elsecode statement that would increment 1 of 2 counter variables. After that, though, they asked how I would solve that same problem, if the array could contain any letter of the alphabet. I said that I would go about it the same way, with a long codeIFcode statement, or a codeswitchcode statement. In hindsight, that doesnt seem so efficient is there an easier way to go about doing thisp

Negative 543 pI have a custom view class derived from MKMapView which is overlapped at the top from an UINavigationBar to get this translucent style. I found out i must implement inside the UIViewController the TopLayoutGuide to move the top compass subview from the MKMapView in its right position to be visible. This works perfect, but i also have a custom subview inside my view and i cant figure out how i get the new top offset from the UIViewController from inside the View to position my subview correctly. How did Apple this magic for their subviews inside MKMapViewp

Each of these items has what we call a empem value aces a strength of 4, kings a strength of 3, queens 2, jacks 1, and all other cards 0. We want to choose a subset of C, the bridge hand with 13 cards, such that the sum of the empem values of the items in the hand exceeds 12. Moreover, we want to do this efficiently.  p  pWe hope to do this in On time, but any polynomial time algorithm is good enough.  We certainly do not want to just try every possible subset of C of size 13 and then check whether it satisfies the pvalue constraint.p  hr  pThe problem goes on to say that we want the subsets chosen to be a uniformly random distribution over all the possible such subsets, but the solution says that this is NPcomplete. However what if I dont need the distribution of selected subsets of cards to be perfectly uniform It would be good enough for me to have an approximate solution that feels random. Is there an algorithm to do thisp

Negative 543 pHas Anyone else experienced this issue with ZBar My app stopped detecting bar codes when I migrated my project to XCode 6  iOS8 and I am using ZBar 1.3 code.  No error message is thrown.  App just stopped detecting bar codes.  I recompiled my ZBar project for arm64, armv7 amp armv7s and merged the simulator and iphone libzbar.a file into one and reinserted into my project.  Still not able to scan using ZBar in my app and I noticed there are about 245 warnings in the ZBar code that arise from deprecation of functions in iOS6 and iOS7 amongst other things.  I also noticed another developers app that uses ZBar has stopped working when I upgraded my phone to iOS8 as well.  BTW It looks like the ZBar code hasnt been updated since 2012 in Mercurial so, I may just write my own bar code scanning routine using the AVFoundation framework.p

As I do some actions like searching, paging, filter, sorting etc on each of these actions 100 rows are returned from server, the memory usage of browser grows steadily and during my testing it reached up to 950MB of memory usage. I am not using any codecomputedcode observables or using a codemanual subscriptioncode with both codeResumeListingDatacode and codeListingDatacode observable arrays. Just clearing them both using code[]code and assigning values in the above mentioned way when any action is performed.p  pWhere can be the issue I have faced this problem for the first time so are there any tools to monitor browser memoryp  pI am using codesetIntervalcode to bind 100 rows with a delay so that the browser doesnt hang when binding the codetablecode. Is there any alternate better way to do this Any other performance optimized way to codepushcode items into an codeobservable arraycodep
Negative 543 pI have the following html and jquery  I am trying to replace the initial video loaded with the video in the hidden span tag. The src of the IFrame is replaced but the video disappears and nothing is displayed. I believe it might have something to do with the way the file is hosted and rendered by the hosting company. I have tried the JQuery reload and the clone but no joy.

Negative 543 pIm trying to pass a partial function to the union of all the RDDs captured in a DStream batch over a sliding window.

I want to use codecollectf PartialFunction[T, U]code on the union of all K of these RDDs. I could call the union operator codecode using codeforeachRDDcode, but I want to return an codeRDDcode not a codeUnitcode and avoid side effects. p  pWhat Im looking for is a reducer like p  precodedef reducef RDD[T], RDD[T]  RDD[T] RDD[T] codepre  pon a codeDStreamcode that I can use like sop  precodewindow.reduce  .transform.collectmyPartialFunc codepre  pBut this is not available in the Spark Streaming API. p  pDoes anyone have any good ideas for combining RDDs captured in a stream into a single RDD so I can pass in a partial function Or for implementing my own RDD reducer Perhaps this feature is coming in a subsequent Spark releasep
Negative 543 pI have a a hrefhttpsquare.github.iodagger relnofollowDaggera object graph that is able to produce instances of codeMyClasscode implicitly, as the constructor of codeMyClasscode is annotated with codeInjectcode.p  pI also have a module that I codepluscode onto my existing graph. My goal is for the plused graph, and only for the plused graph, to treat codeMyClasscode as a singleton and to always return the same instance.p  pHow can I best achieve that with minimal boilerplate code, i.e. withoutp  pa Constructing the instances myself in the plusedon module by writing a codeProvides Singletoncode method, declaring all the dependencies of codeMyClasscodep  precodeModule public class Submodule    Provides Singleton MyClass provideMyClassDepA depA, DepB depB      return new MyClassdepA, depB     codepre  pb Extracting an interface from codeMyClasscode and again writing provider methodsp  precodeModule public class Submodule    Provides Singleton IMyClass provideMyClassMyClassImpl myClass      return myClass     codepre  pMy concrete use case is that of an Android app, where an codeActivitycode instance depends on a presenter that should also be injected in fragments of the activity.

Negative 543 pI have implemented a jQuery clientside validation on my contact form after receiving multiple spam emails. After ensuring the validation works correctly, I am still receiving the spam emails. Somehow the fields do not meet the validation rules I set, yet are still going through. For example, I am testing for a valid email address, but the form allows a number 1 to be used in the email field. I investigated the Google Analytics and it doesnt appear a user was even on the Contact Page at the time the emails are being sent. Can anyone offer any explanation I would like to avoid backend validation, if possible.p

Negative 543 pI have the problem where I want to use Picasso for my ListView, as it has great bitmap caching, but currently have to simply use codeimageView.setImageBitmapbitmapcode.p  pI have a list of bitmaps strongwhich are not downloaded or stored as files, I simply have the Bitmap objects as they were originally from the users camera or phone storage but at this point the app has placed image effects on each of the bitmaps so that they are unique from the originalsstrong, for examplep  precodeArrayListltBitmapgt bitmapList  new ArrayListltgt codepre  pEach list item is simply an ImageView that displays one of these bitmaps. When trying to use Picasso for this, I realized I cant simply set an ImageView to a bitmap like the freedom of codeImageView.setImageBitmapcode allows me to do, but instead I need the image URI. From what Ive seen, the only way to get the URIs from these bitmaps is to store the images on the device first, then extract the URIs from these stored images. The issue with this is it takes a while in the app to save all of these images, then extracting the correct one for each list item is an issue in its own.p  pIs there any way to use Picasso for ImageViews with just having a bitmap, without saving the image to the device first, similarly to how codeImageView.setImageBitmapcode worksp
Negative 543 pstrongWhat is the point in using PHPSpec if I cant access or use any Eloquent methodsstrongp  pFor example this reffers to an Eloquent codeProductcode modelp  precodefunction itremovespropertyPropertyValueInterface property              thisgtaddPropertyproperty     thisgtpropertiesgtshouldHaveCount1      thisgtremovePropertyproperty     thisgtpropertiesgtshouldHaveCount0   codepre  pThis will not work as within the methods codeaddPropertycode and coderemovePropertycode there are calls to various Eloquent Collection and Model functions, it seems PHPSpec cant handle this, even when all these classes are included with codeusecode statements.p  pI noticed in Jeffery Ways screen casts on Laracasts he never uses a real Eloquent model. He only uses vanilla PHP objects.

Negative 543 pI am currently a junior engineer and keen on learning best practices and expanding my experience. My question concerns any static programming language such as Java, C, C etc.p  pWhen I am writing code, I like making it easy to read. In my opinion, reading code should be like reading a book. It should be fluent and elegant. Then, even if I do not need to use them, I like prepending codethiscode, codesupercodecodebasecode keywords whenever I can. Ditto for current class name when I want to use constants or static variablesmethods.p  pConsequently, another developer can quickly have a long shot. He knows this method or var is in the current class or in mother class without needed to move to declaration. You may say to me it is really easy to do that with recent IDE. However, I know a bunch of guys who are still working with Vim, Emacs or other editors without these fancy features.p  pWhen explaining it, I like comparing my practices to a drama book. We have all read at least one of them, such as Macbeth from Shakespeare. Who has never felt frustrated to go back at the beginning of the book to know who is that character and what part he has in the plot You did that so many times, rightp  pMy question can be associated to literate programming practices. However, I assumed Donald Knuths recommandations are more about commenting and adding macros to your code.p  pSo I would like to know your opinions and feedbacks about these practices. Am I doing too much Should I keep it simpler Am I breaking OOP rulesp  pHere is a code samplep  precodeclass Bar      protected int motherVar      public aBarMethod     class Foo extends Bar      private static ListltStringgt strings      private int myPrivateVar      public void aMethod          super.aBarMethod          this.myPrivateVar         super.motherVar  2           public static String anotherMethod          String outcome            for String s  Foo.strings              outcome  s                   return outcome       codepre

Negative 543 pThe problem was, that I had a C vector and needed to convert it to a numpy array. The vector was from an external library. All I could sanely do, was to add an extra function into the source and recompile it again to the original DLL. The idea was, that I import the function with ctypes, then call it with a void pointer pointer and let the C function insert the vector pointer.  Here started the first problems. I was only able to send a pointer back to Python by explicitly allocating memory. Not only needed I to usep  precodemyVec  new vectorltTgt codepre  peven for an int pointer I needed to usep  precodemyIntP  new int codepre  pSimply doingp  precodex  10 int myIntP  ampx pythonIntPP  myIntP codepre  pwill not work. Back in Python, I will still have the original pointer.p  precodepythonIntPP  x codepre  pwill work, though.p  pWhy do I have to allocate memory for a pointerp  pAnyway, lets get to the solution I found First, you will have a C function in a DLL that accepts a void. In Python dop  precodefrom ctypes import  lib  cdll.LoadLibraryrCpathto.dll gvp  lib.GetVectorPointer gvp.restype  cint gvp.argtypes  [POINTERcvoidp, POINTERcint]  we need the vector pointer and size voidPP  pointercvoidp sizeP  pointercint gvpvoidPP, sizeP codepre  pNow we have the vector pointer and size in a Python object, but we cant unpack the pointer in Cython. So, we need create a cdef function, export it in a DLL pyd file and again import it within Python.p  pIn Cython we dop  precodeimport numpy as np cimport numpy as np  from libcpp.vector cimport vector  ctypedef vector[T] Vec ctypedef myVec VecP ctypedef VecP VecPP  arr  np.empty1, dtypenp.uint8  def allocatearrsize     arr.resizesize, refcheckFalse  cdef public int vectonumpyvoid voidPP     cdef VecP vecp ltVecPgtppVoid[0]     cdef int size  vecp[0].size     cdef np.ndarray[T, ndim1] data  arr  arr needs to be allocated      cdef int i     for i in rangesize         data[i]  vecp[0][i]      return 0 codepre  pIn Python we can now call this function and get the arrayp  precodelib  windll.LoadLibraryrCpathtomodule.pyd v2n  lib.vectonumpy v2n.restype  cint v2n.argtypes  [POINTERcvoidp] import module module.allocatearrsizeP  allocate first v2nvoidPP  send the vector pointer to the Cython function  module.arr  this is the numpy array with the vector data codepre  pTIP You can tell the linker to export your Cython function with one of two hacks. Write this line for every function to export at the beginning of your code change names accordingly.p  precodecdef void emitpragma foo npragma commentlinker, exportvectonumpyvectonumpynstatic void unused pass codepre  por use this hack in your function definition use stdcall to avoid name mangling.p  precodecdef int vectonumpy unusednextern C declspecdllexport  public int stdcall vectonumpy void voidPP codepre  pDo you know of better ways to have full flexibility between those three languagesp  pIs there a simpler way to export symbols, so that they can be imported into Python that doesnt involve hacking Being able to use cdef function directly in Python is very handy to me.p

Negative 543 pI have a WPFMVVMLight application. My main viewviewmodel has a data grid with code behind in the viewmodel. I recently decided Id like this datagrid in a 2nd view, one view is live data, one view is showing history of same data. I dont want to duplicate this code in two places so I decided to create a usercontrol with a viewmodel and move the appropriate datagridcode to the usercontrol. p  pHere is the issuequestion I would like to set the usercontroldatagriditemsource to a property in my main viewmodel. Ive seen some examples where people create dependencyproperties but Im not sure how to handle this because I cant inherit DependencyObject in my viewmodel because it already inherits ViewModelBase from mvvm light, so I cant use GetValueSetValue as seen below. Im very new to this so I may be missing something very obvious.

My user control has a VM with code behind with properties for the bindings you see below and some additional code related to the context menu. p  pThe issue im trying to resolve is how to set the usercontrol datagrid itemsource now that it is in a usercontrol that is nested in my main view, and eventually will be nested in one more view. My mainview has a ObservableCollection with the data I want the usercontroldatagriditemsource set to.

Negative 543 pSo, this is a web app specifically targeted for mobile phones.p  pTheres a tall, scrolling page. In that page, theres a codedivcode that contains a small chart.p  pMy goal is to allow users to click that codedivcode when they do, that codedivcode expands to fill the viewport, so they can see a much larger version of that chart. When theyre done, they can click a close button, and the codedivcode should shrink back to its original small size. Essentially, I want the codedivcode to go fullscreen.p  pNote that I dont actually need the strongemoriginalemstrong div to grow and shrink I can create a strongemnew codedivcodeemstrong that emlooks likeem a bigger version of the original codedivcode.p  pOne requirement... once the codedivcode is fullscreen  I need to allow users to strongemhorizontally scrollemstrong the content within that codedivcode i.e., the codedivcodes content is wider than the viewport.p  pHeres what Ive tried so far...p  pWhen the user clicks the original codedivcode, I create a new codedivcode and append it to the document.body.p  pThe new codedivcode has the following cssp  precodenewdiv      position absolute     top 0     left 0     height 100     width 100  codepre  pThis has the desired effect  the new codedivcode overlays the content, fills the entire screen. The problem is that, if the user strongemscrolls verticallyemstrong, the new codedivcode scrolls offscreen since the underlying content is much taller than the viewport.p  pMy second attempt was to use codeposition fixedcode on the new codedivcode that worked better, since the new codedivcode didnt scroll offscreen, but the underlying content was still scrolling you could see the bounce effect, and iOSs vertical scrollbar. Plus, the URL bar and backnext chrome at the bottom go a little crazy, and the overall effect is buggy.p  pI thought about trying to prevent scrolling altogether, but I cant, because the content in the new codedivcode must be horizontally scrollable.p  pSo my third attempt was to to temporarily set codedisplaynonecode on strongemall the other elementsemstrong in codedocument.bodycode. This works, but seems like a very inelegant way to do something that probably has a very clean, simple solution.p  pThe HTML5 Fullscreen API seems like the perfect solution, but its not available for iOS Safari.p

Negative 543 pIn my main activity, Im filling a recyclerview with an array of strings however, Im getting those strings from my parse database. p  pI now know that when you query for information the method is asynchronous meaning it runs in the background waiting to receive a response from the database while your code continues to run. I ran into the problem that it took too long to fill an array with the strings and the recycerview was already filled with null values because the array hadnt been filled yetp  pSo I decided save to the data locally with parse and use the database to back up the information.

It was the same story.p  pDoes anyone know an optimized way to retrieve data so its fast enough to fill the recyclerview because right now it takes like a full 3 seconds to get the strings.

Negative 543 pSometimes when writing python software I end up in a situation in which I am not sure whether to use a function with sub functions, or just a class. In these cases, I have a series of distinct inputs, I want to apply some transform to them and then produce a distinct output. And I dont much care about any of the variables that are created in the process of going from inputs to outputs. So it feels like it should be a simple function in this sense rather than a Class. But for these cases, its also quite a complex series of operations that are involved, often with a need for sub functions that are only useful in the process of transforming the inputs to outputs and not in any more general sense.p  pAnd at the end of the day, I usually just want to call it usingp  precodeoutput  myfunctioninput codepre  pSo I can do something likep  precodedef myfunctioninput     def subfunc1blah         return blah1output     def subfunc2blah         return blah2output     lots of complex code here that calls subfunc1 and subfunc2     return output codepre  pBut then coworker X might come along and say, wow that looks like a pretty complex function, you should use a class OR I could do this p  precodeclass myfunctionobject    def newself, input       lots of complex code here that calls subfunc1 and subfunc2       return output      staticmethod      def subfunc1blah         return blah1output     staticmethod      def subfunc2blah         return blah2output codepre  pBut, this seems to be like an odd use for a class because I dont really care about creating and maintaining instances of the class. p  pA major advantage of using classes here though is that you can more easily test subfunc1 and codesubfunc2code and this alone might be sufficient reason to use one.p  pHowever, as Im still new to programming can someone suggest the best possible solution for a production environment andor the solution that is generally most pythonic p

Negative 543 pI have a secure websocket server using a selfsigned certificate that Im not able to connect to from a chrome v44.0.2403.107 client. Its my test server, and its created using pretty near identical code to my app server  which I emcanem connect to. p  pIve tried restarting chrome. Ive tried restarting my VM and all my putty instances. I know the port is correct because I can debug to the point in my server where the port is used, and I see that its 8090. I can do the same in my client 8090. When i set a breakpoint at the callback in my server thats supposed to receive a websocket connection request, it never gets hit. The exact same breakpoint in my app server emdoesem get hit, so Ive ruled out debugging issues.p  pThe error Im receiving in the console when it fails to connect is codeWebSocket connection to wsslocalhost8090 failed WebSocket opening handshake was canceledcode. Im also seeing only one frame in the network tab for that connection codeOpcode 1 Length 40 170608.360code and then of course I get a websocket error event that contains no additional useful info. What does Opcode 1 mean p  pHere is the output I get from tcpdump on the VMside, verifying that I am in fact getting network traffic from my browser to my VM I set a breakpoint right before creating the WebSocket handle, and only when I press go does all this stuff happenp  precode[vagrantlocalhost temp] sudo tcpdump nnXSs 0 port 8090 tcpdump verbose output suppressed, use v or vv for full

before, the problem still exists. So seems like I can rule out an issue with my code  is this a problem with my machine, network interfacesp  pstrongUpdate2strong Its emstillem happening even after I restarted my entire machine. Now im getting a little pissed off because this is actually going to block me from working. I really thought the problem would probably disappear at least for a while after restarting..p  pstrongUpdate3strong I created a node client that can successfully connect to the websocket server. So it seems to be a chrome issue. It certainly looks similar to what you see when it rejects the selfsigned cert  but Im using the same cert for my test server and app server. One works, the other doesnt, so it cant be the cert, rightp

Negative 543 pSo I have a codeSpycode which performs a new object creation, related to the refactoring pattern of  Method to Object however, that newly created instance does not have its dependent services injected in.p  pThe code is obviously not my property to post up on this forum, but in pseudo logic, Ill try to get the message across belowp  precodeMock private SpecialistService specialistServiceMock InjectMocks private TestObject testObj  new TestObject codepre  palthough codeTestObjectcode inherits this service from its Abstract parent class, and any usage directly in codetestObjcode the codespecialistServiceMockcode is not null and works fine.p  pNow, when codetestObjcode hits the new codeRefactoredMethodToObjectcode class, and calls its codeinvokecode method, it needs to have codespecialistServiceMockcode to do a few things, but codespecialistServiceMockcode is null.p  pI appreciate this looks to be beyond Mockitos capability, I do have PowerMock at hand too.p  pSo in a nutshell, I need to have the codespecialistServiceMockcode mocked for actions needed to be performed in the dynamically created instance of codeRefactoredMethodToObjectcode.p  pAny ideas would be welcome, and if you need more information, let me know. Thanksp

Negative 543 pI have application which has successfully integrated apple push notifications, when user logs in to the application app registers with the push notification and token is saved on our backend, when user sign out from the app, we remove the push notification tokens from our backend. but if user uninstall app from the device WITHOUT SIGNOUT from app, and then reinstall,in that case we can still send push notifications to the device, since app is newly installed and not logged in any user we have to remove tokens from the backend. since iOS app does not have any API for uninstallation events how can I remove device token from backend. I can use push notification feedback service to get uninstalled device tokens but how can I resolve the issue when user removes the application and then reinstall.p  pI tested this scenario with skype, it also have this issue. install Skype  Log In  now you can send app to Background and send some chats from any other device, you will get push notifications  then Remove app from Device without SignOut from Skype  ReInstall Skype  now if we send skype chat we receives push notifications but skype app is newly installed and no one is logged inp

Negative 543 pI have several objects  of Class A that are imported using Json.  Each have 2 fields.p  precodeSeveral Objects of Class A    field1    field2 codepre  pIn the program  the values of the fields are changed.  These objects are then returned with the updated fields.p  pWithin the program  we need to create and keep track of few Temporary fields for each of these objects  examplep  precodeSeveral Objects of Class A    field1    field2    Tempfield3    Tempfield4 codepre  pAfter the run.  The Objects are sent back with the original field i.e. field1 and field2.p  pClass A  is being used by several programs, thus we cannot add the Temp fields to the Class definition itself.p  pRight now  I map the Objects of ClassA 2 fields, to Objects of ClassB which has the 4 fields  including temp fields local to the program. At the end of the run  the Objects of ClassA are updated with the field values from corresponding Objects from ClassB.p  pIs there a better way to do thisp
