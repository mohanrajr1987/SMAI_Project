Positive 982 pI am trying to understand how to store an a hrefhttpsen.m.wikipedia.orgwikiUnixtime relnofollowUnix timestampa that is, a number of seconds since 1970 expressed in the a hrefhttpsen.wikipedia.orgwikiCoordinatedUniversalTime relnofollowUTCaGMT timezone inside an a hrefhttpsen.m.wikipedia.orgwikiHSQLDB relnofollowHSQLDBa embedded file database. However, I have yet to understand how TZ handling works with HSQL. p  pMy program will be used from different zones, so using UTC is a must. Moreover, I cannot change the default time zone as with codejava.util.TimeZone.setDefaultcode as it will be embedded in other programs and therefore should not change the environment.p  pstrongMy attemptstrong  the doc statesp  blockquote   pWhen datetime values are sent to the database using the PreparedStatement or CallableStatement interfaces, the Java object is converted to the type of the prepared or callable statement parameter. This type may be DATE, TIME, or TIMESTAMP with or without time zone. The time zone displacement is the time zone of the JDBC session.p blockquote  pSo I use a TIMESTAMP column inside the database without time zone  the default, and issue codeSET TIME ZONE INTERVAL 000 HOUR TO MINUTEcode to put the session in UTC TZ and then codeINSERT INTO TEST VALUEScode with  being a Java Timestamp object containing the correct Unix value GMT related, tested  OK.p  pSadly, in this case, the SQL log of the database shows the timestamp has been reverted back to my local time zone 2. For a timestamp of 1442132237635 8H17 in UTC, 10H17 in 2, we get codeTIMESTAMP20150913 101717.602000code in the log. Wrong result... it seems changing the session time zone has absolutely no impact whatsoever Ive tried 14, 14... no changes. The SET order is however correctly executed  it appears in the SQL log, and the value of TIMEZONE changes afterwards.p  pstrongOther attemptsstrongp  pIve also tried to use a TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE column, without setting the session TZ. In that case, the database stores local time 2, and I can extract the correct timestamp from it. This is borderline ridiculous  it means the HSQLDB driver takes the Java timestamp UTC, interprets it correctly as UTC, casts it to the JVM default TZ then sends that to the DB. I dont want the TZ info in the DB  dont need it. of note changing the session TZ has no impact  the SQL order issued is always with my local TZ... makes you wonder what is the point of the SET TZ orderp  pAnd changing the default JVM TZ to UTC works but as stated above I cannot do that.p  pAlso of note a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comq15712832252642this questiona seems related but the provided answer is basically to hack every SQL order which i would like to avoid...p  pstrongMy questionstrongp  pHow can I simply store my UTC Java timestamp inside HSQLDB And what is the purpose of the SET TIME ZONE orderp  pThanks for reading.p

Positive 982 pI am developing a library to store complex data in an Object. One of the field in this object is a date.

In my codegetcode method, I am doing the following p  precodereturn new DatestoredDateinMilliseconds codepre  pThe problem is that if anyone is calling codetoStringcode on the returned object, it uses the default timezone to return the date.

Negative 982 pI have read many questions and answers around here that had similar sounding terms in them as this question, but all of them ended up being about building against different major versions of .Net. I am in much deeper trouble, unfortunately.p  pHere is the story. Our customers use version 2.0 of the .Net framework. Just 2.0, no service packs at all. Our developers used to use .Net 2.0 SP1, which worked fine. Now, due to other projects we are working on, the developers myself included updated to .Net 2.0 SP2. And this is where the trouble began. Apparently, in its infinite wisdom, MS decided to changeadd API to the framework strongwithout incrementing the major versionstrong to, say, 2.1. So when you build against 2.0, it builds against 2.0 SP2 if you have it installed and there doesnt seem to be a way to configure it. So the developer can now write code thinking he is targeting 2.0, but it wont work on the customer machinesp  pWe have noticed that certain builds done using msbuild started failing on our test boxes, but work fine on the developers machines. Obviously, because the testbox is setup the way client machines are, and their older framework is missing some of the APIs. Now the build farm is going to install the newer version of the CLR including spervice packs and higher major revisons to test all our projects, so the builds that use the API that are not in original 2.0 will no longer fail... this is terrible news for compatibility testing.p  pSo my question is this. How to build using msbuild against a specific CLR revision of the same major version. Failing that, how to make sure VS2005 throws an error when a particular project uses features incompatible with particular revsion of the CLR to throw a wrench into the cogs, no FxCop or similar integration, basic VS2005 features onlyp  pIf the above questions do not have a positive answer, I am all for seeking alternatives.p  pThank you.p

Your own functionstrongp  precodefunction   .fn.newPlugin  function       return this.eachfunction            jQuery codepre  pIMHO the second way is a bit cleaner and easier to work with, but seems like there could be some advantage to writing it with code.extendcode Or am I overthinking this, there is no discernible difference and its just a matter of personal preferencep  pI would have thought this would have been asked before, but I cant find it  if its out there, please direct me to itp
Negative 982 pI have frequently encounter the following debugging scenariop  pTester provide some reproduce steps for a bug. And to find out where the problem is, I try to play with these reproduce steps to get the minimum necessary reproduce steps. Sometimes, luckily I found that when do a minor change to the steps, the problem is gone.p  pThen the job turns to find the difference in code workflow between these two reproduce steps. This job is tedious and painful especially when you are working on a large code base and it go through a lot code and involve lots of state changes which you are not familiar with.p  pSo I was wondering is there any tools available to compare code workflow. As Ive learned the wt command in WinDbg, I thought it might be possible to do it. For example, I can run the wt command on some out most functions with 2 different reproduce steps and then compare the difference between outputs. Then it should be easy to found where the code flow starts to diverge.p  pBut the problem with WinDBG is wt is quite slow maybe I should use a log file instead of output to screen and not very userfriendly compared with visual studio debugger ... So I  want to ask you guys is there any existing tools available . or is it possible and difficult to develop a plugin for visual studio debugger to support this functionality p  pThanks p

Im aware that this is possible, but Im not sure that WF is the best approach for this type of code, as the user interaction may be required at many different points through the entire workflow, and the workflow will drive what data entry screens are needed.  We are using a WinFormsASP.NET web forms package for UI, which is homegrown and difficult to push deployments on, so something like SharePoint integration is out of the question.  Our backend is DB2, and the workflow code whether its in WF or otherwise will need to interact with that as well.  p  pI guess the bottom line is, should we look into using WF for this, or would we be better served just coding it ourselves  Can WF easily integrate data entry screens to capture information that can be used further on in the workflowp

But what Im now going to do is just to protect it in a reasonable manner that a commonadvanced user cannot screw it up.p  pOK, in order to proof that I have googled and searched a lot at StackOverflow.com, Im listing all the possible strategies I gotp  h11. Registry Entryh1  pFirst, some users might not have the access to even read the Registry table.p  pSecond, if we put the Protection Trial Info in a Registry Entry, the user can always find it out where it is by comparing the differences before and after the software installation.  They can just simply change it.p  pOK, you might say that we should encrypt the Protection Trial Info, yes we can do that.  But what if the user just change their system date before installingp  pOK, you might say that we should also put a lastused date, if something is wrong, the lastused date could work as a protection guide.  But what if the user just uninstall the software and delete all Registry Entries related to this software, and then reinstall the softwarep  pI have no idea on how to deal with this.  Please help.p  h1A Plain Fileh1  pFirst, there are some places to put the plain filep  ul li2.a a simple XML file under software installation pathli li2.b configuration fileli ul  pAgain, the user can just uninstall the software and remove these plain files, and reinstall the software.p  h1  The Software Itselfh1  pIf we put the protection trial info Expiration Date, we cannot put Number of Used Times in the software itself, it is still susceptible to the cases I mentioned above.  Furthermore, its not even cool to do so.p  h1  A Trial ProductKeyh1  pIt works like a licensing process, that is, we put the Trial info into an RSAsigned string.  However, it requires too many steps for a user to have a try of using the software they might lose patiencep  ul li4.a The user downloads the softwareli li4.b The user sends an email to request a Trial ProductKey by providing user name or email or hardware infoli li4.c The server receives the request, RSAsigns it and send back to  the userli li4.d The user can now use it under the condition of Expiration Date amp Number of Used Times.li ul  pNow, the server has a record of the users username or hardware info, so the user will be rejected to request a second trial.  Is it legal to collection hardware infop  pIn a word, the user has to do one more extra step request a Trial Product Key just for having a try of using the software, which is not cool thinking myself as a user.p  pNOTE This question is not about the Licensing, instead, its about where to store the TRIAL info. After the trial expires, the user should ask for a license CDKeyProductKey.  Im going to use RSA signature bound to User Hardwarep  pP.S. My software will be targetting the China market, whose software market is different from US. Most people in China, they only buy hardware, they usually dont buy software like Micosoft WindowsOffice they just use pirated copies. However, some professional software aiming to a specific field, research people are still willing to buy it IF there is no crack version or the crack version is very difficult to install.p
Negative 982 pI have been looking at using JOGL to create some things and have been looking through what documentation I can find.p  pBrief tutorials they all mention how using the JOGL version of canvas can have performance issues and instead you should use NEWT.

Negative 982 pIm new to genetic algorithms and Ive been assigned to implement a genetic algorithm to optimize the order of requests per weekday of a pharmacy. First of all, let me explain the problemp  pThere are 9 families which issue requests to be attended at any day of a work week monday to friday. The pharmacy can only attend 1 to 3 families per day, no more no less and they cant repeat any family in the same week. The main goal is to optimize the best day for each family to be attended, in that way, the pharmacy attends the maximum requests per week with the constraints imposed on the problem. The input to the optimization algorithm is the annual mean of each number of requests issued by each family.

Negative 982 pCurrently, Im building a game with pure UIKit. Its a game where some character is catching  falling items. All the objects are moving along the three points trajectory each object appear at point A, then move to point B and then fall to point C. For me, it is important only one moment  item in point B. I need to check, does the character is catching the item in point B. Currently, I have a timer in the main game controller that is constantly posting notifications. Game items are observers, they listen to that notification and reposition themselves they move themselves. Now, with that timer, each item is moving by the small steps from point A to point B. When it is at point B, an item method checks, does the character is catching him. If no then Im performing UIView animation with duration from point B to point C.  p  pIm thinking that the whole movement could be animated, maybe with Core Animation CAKeyframeAnimation class or smth. The only problem is, Im not sure about how to fire a callback for checking the catch in the middle of animation  in the point B. Some say that it is impossible a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions3493992howcanicallbackasacabasicanimationisanimatingherea and if I have the whole animation and I need to get current item position then I need to have a timer that is regularly pullingreading the model data from presentationLayer. But Im not sure about this approach because, now, I do not store a pointer to screen items from my main game controller  the game controller only creates an item and game timer posts notifications to those objects. But I would need to have such one in order to implement proposed solution. Also, I should read the presentationLayer from the whole bunch of screen items.     p  pThe another alternative would be to split one animation into two animations first, animate from A to B and then to fire a completion callback for checking a catch. Then, perform another animation from B to C.p  pGuys, what are your opinions on that, maybe you have another proposalsp

Negative 982 pWe have a web application that saves survey data in XML format, rather than to a standard database. It uses a thirdparty survey component actually, a hrefhttpwww.4guysfromrolla.comarticles0616041.aspx relnofollowthis componenta, but modified to add some functionalityp  pRight now were using a very restrictive whitelist validation approach to prevent potentially malicious input from making it into the survey results XML file.  However, the whitelist rules are turning into a support problem for our customers.  Theyre simply too restrictive, and Im wondering if Im simply being emtooem restrictive.  I dont know what the effects are on an XML document if someone were to use angled brackets htmlxml tags unclosed or closed, etc.  p  pIf Im storing these in CDATA sections, and then sanitizing the output will that prevent corruption to the XML document in these cases  We do use the Microsoft.AntiXss and Web Protection libraries to sanitize all untrusted output.p  pBetter yet, is there a guide to preventing XML injection, or XSS specific to XML data  or am I just overthinking thisp  pThe core question is, do I need to filter the input as long as Im sanitizing the output properly  My paranoid nature says yes, but Im not sure and thought Id ask for some expert opinions.p
Negative 982 pJust a few minutes back I answered a question asking about the emMaximum possible size of HashMap in Javaem. As I have always read, strongemHashMap is a growable datastructure. Its size is only limited by the JVM memory size.emstrong Hence I thought that there is no hard limit to its size and answered accordingly. The same is applicable to HashSet as well.p  pBut someone corrected me saying that since the strongsizestrong method of HashMap returns an strongintstrong, there emisem a limit on its size. A perfectly correct point. I just tried to test it on my local but failed, I need more than 8GB memory to insert more than 2,147,483,647 integers in the HashMap, which I dont have.p  pMy questions werep  ul liWhat happens when we try to insert 2,147,483,647  1 element in the HashMapHashSetli liIs there an error thrownli liIf yes, which error If not what happens to the HashMapHashSet, its already existing elements and the new element li ul  pIf someone is blessed with access to a machine with say 16GB memory, you can try it out practically. p

Negative 982 pThe W3C spec for IndexedDB defines a hrefhttpwww.w3.orgTRIndexedDBdfnkeygenerator relnofollowa key generatora asp  blockquote   pA key generator generates a monotonically increasing numbers [sic] every time a key is needed.p blockquote  pNow, it seems to me that a common use case for IndexedDB or, for that matter, any of the HTML5 clientside storage options WebSQL, localStorage etc. would be apps designed to work offline in conjunction with HTML5 ApplicationCache.p  pIn this scenario, a emdisconnectedem web application might generate new objectsrecords in its local data store that are later synced to a centralised database when a connection to the server becomes available.p  pFurther, any application where multiple clients sync to the emsameem centralised database typically requires a mechanism to prevent ID collisions.p  pUUID or GUID is a good choice, as it enables unique key generation without any central coordination. By contrast, emmonotonically incrementing numbersem is a poor solution unless each client is seeded with a starting value that is unlikely to collide with other users.p  pI find it surprising that the IndexedDB spec does not specify or even allow for future support of alternate key generators, such as a UUID generator. Some may suggest that the answer is simply not to use IndexedDBs builtin key generator at all, instead have your application generate its own keys.p  pHowever, while there are plenty of Javascriptbased UUID generators available, many of them seem to be based on Math.random which has known limitations in terms of its emrandomnessem, so might not be a good choice if absolute unique keys must be guaranteed.p  pA native UUID generator provided by the IndexedDB implementors would presumably be more robust and perform better than a script implementedimported by the application one would think.p  pSo am I missing something here, or is this a missed opportunity by the W3C IndexedDB working groupp

Negative 982 pIm using JAXRS to provide an HTTPbased interface to manage a data model. The data model is stored in a database and interacted with via JPA.p  pThis allows me to modify the interface to the data model to suit REST clients and mostly seems to work quite well. However, Im not sure how to handle the scenario where a method provided by a JAXRS resource requires a transaction, which affects the JPA get, update, commitontxend pattern, because there is only a transaction wrapping the get operation, so the update is never committed. I can see the same problem occurring if a single REST operation requires multiple JPA operations.p  pAs Im using Springs transaction support, the obvious thing to do is to apply codeTransactionalcode to these methods in the JAXRS resources. However, in order for this to work, Spring needs to manage the lifecycle of the JAXRS resources, and the useage examples Im aware of have resources being created via new when needed, which makes me a little nervous anyway.p  pI can think of the following solutionsp  ol liupdate my JPA methods to provide a transactionmanaged version of everything I want to do from my REST interface atomically. Should work, keeps transactions out of the JAXRS layer, but prevents the get, update, commitontxend pattern and means I need to create a very granular JPA interface.li liInject Resource objects but they are typically stateful holding at least the ID of the object being interacted withli liDitch the hierarchy of resources and inject big, stateless super resources at the root that manage the entire hierarchy from that root not cohesive, big servicesli liHave a hierarchy of injected, stateless, transactionsupporting helper objects that shadow the actual resources the resources are instantiated and hold ths state but delegate method invocations to the helper objectsli ol  pAnyone got any suggestions Its quite possible Ive missed some key point somewhere.p  hr  pUpdate  to work around the lack of a transaction around the get, update, commitontxclose flow, I can expose the EntityManager mergeobject method and call it manually.

Negative 982 pEDIT clarifying the goal of my question I lose a lot of time diagnosing problems that I expect the linker to report, caused by an admittedly bad programming style, which pops up when e.g. copypasting a block of code from one compilation unit to another, and altering it.p  pIm looking for a way to detect this problem at compilelink time.p  pIn this setupp  pstrongA.hstrongp  precodevoid foo codepre  pstrongA.cppstrongp  precodestruct A     int values[100]   A      stdcout ltlt FILE ltlt  AAn  void foo     A a  codepre  pstrongmain.cppstrongp  precodeinclude A.h struct A     double values[100]   A    stdcout ltlt FILE ltlt  AAn  int main foo   void foo gt this would cause a linker error codepre  pI would love the linker to report that the structure codeAcode, or at least the constructor codeAAcode, is defined twice.p  pHowever, g 4.4 links just fine.  Running the code shows that in this case, the linker chose to use the codeAcode from A.cpp.p  precode g Wall A.cpp main.cpp ampamp .a.out A.cpp3 A.cpp7 A.cpp3 codepre  pWhen a emfunctionem codefoocode is present in two object files, the linker reports a multiple definition allright, but for the structures, it doesnt.p  pEDIT just found by using codenm C .ocode that both A.o and main.o have codeAAcode defined as a emweak symbolem.  This causes it to be selectable from a pool of symbols with the same name.  Maybe the question can be rephrased to how can I cause the compiler to generate emstrongem symbols...p  precode00000000 W AA codepre  pHow can I detect this problemp

Negative 982 pI understand that in Java, if an object doesnt have any references to it any more, the garbage collector will reclaim it back some time later.p  pBut how does the garbage collector know that an object has or has not references associated to itp  pIs garbage collector using some kind of hashmap or tablep  hr  pstrongEditstrongp  pPlease note that I am not asking how generally gc works. really, I am not asking that. p  pI am asking strongspecificallystrong that How gc knows which objects are live and which are dead, with efficiencies. p  pThats why I say in my question that is gc maintain some kind of hashmap or set, and consistently update the number of references an object hasp

Negative 982 pwe have afew label printer A4 and we use them to print a huge amount of label for our warehouse, beacause we want to print lables which each of them is diffrent from another we decide to make a DBF file for each print job, so each time the DBF file contain number of diffrent  record then our web service make a ftp request to A4 printer and ftp the DBF file to the printer , then the print command send to printer and the DBF file will print. most of the time all of the steps take happen successfully but sometimes the DBF file on the printer is little diffrent from the dbf file was made on the web service and the diffrence is on the header of file , this diiffrence cause to the problem so the printer prints the labels but not to the end of DBF file, for example if the DBF file contain 500 records, printer print just 300 record or diffrent number and then it continue to print but the label contain no data, it means after 300 printer dont read the dbf file and the label is quite raw, but beacause the print command is  500 DBF file also contain 500 records it continue to feed the label until 500.p  pwe compare both of DBF file on the server which hosts the web servicethis is where we create dbf file and the file that ftp on the printer, they are the same, just a bit on the header of file is diiffrent and it makes this problem.p  pi include the code we make DBF file and also the code we use to ftp this file to printer and also i attach both DBF file for a sample.p  pour team works on the project and we study the helps on your web site, but at this point

So is there a way to do it through codeCursorLoadercode I know how to do it with codequerycode. Are the steps very similar Even just a link that explains exactly this would be helpful.p  pPlease note, do not link me to the Google doc as they do not have an example that ever uses the codeinsertcode method from ContentProvider using a codeCursorLoadercode.p  pThanks in advancep  pEdit I should probably mention the reason I am confused with this is because calling a new codeCursorLoadercode automatically calls codeContentProviderscode codequerycode method. But how can I do the same for insertp

Negative 982 pI would like to populate some tables with a large amount of data in order to empirically test the performance of an SQL query in the worst case scenario well, as close to it as possible.p  pI considered using random values. But this would require manual adjustment to get even close to the worst case. Unconstrained random values are no good for a worst case because they tend mostly to be unique  in which case an index on a single column should perform about as well as a compound index. On the other hand, random values chosen from too small a set will result in a large fraction of the rows being returned, which is uninteresting because it reflects not so much emsearchem performance as emlistingem performance.p  pI also considered just looking at EXPLAIN PLAN, but this is not empirical, and also the explanation varies, partly depending on the data that you already have, rather than the worst case.p  pstrongIs there a tool that analyzes a given SQL query and the db schema and ideally indexes, then generates a large data set of a given size that will cause the query to perform as close to worstcase as possiblestrongp  pAny RDBMS is fine.p  pI would also be interested in alternative approaches for gaining this level of insight into worstcase behaviour.p

Negative 982 pFrom a client application I am sending a requesttransaction containing an operation to perform and parameters  transactionID to a remote queue. The remote server dequeue the request at some point and takes some time to process it.p  pOnce it is done processing it, it sends a reponse on the client queue containing the applicative response  the transactionID ... so this is a totally disconnected communication mode, the only way that the client can map the response to the request is via the transactionID.p  pMessage response is dequeued on client side, and matched with the original request based on the transactionID.p  pWhat I am doing right now is that when the client post the request to the server queue, it adds a callback to a dictionnary keeping transactionId and callback delegate. This is a codeDictionaryltint, objectgtcode mapping a transactionId back to a callback to call with the result of the operation.p  pThe callbacksdelegates are stored as object due to the fact that depending of the request, the callback delegate signature is different for example a response may return a codeListltstringgtcode whereas another response may return an codeintcode.p  pWhen the client queue dequeues a response, it knows the type of the response and therefore the corresponding signature of the callback, therefore it gets the callback from the dictionary, based on the transactionID. It then casts the object back to the corresponding delegate type and invoke the callback.p  pI find this approach not very sexy but I do not really see another way of performing such a task.p  pIs there any better way of performing this p  pIf the problem is not clear enough, please let me know and will clarify with some edits.p

Negative 982 pHaving developed various nontrivial applications in Actionscript which, as a dialect of ECMAScript shares a lot with JS Im now used to paying extra attention to obsessing over event listeners. At some point, after profiling various apps and reading related literature, it became obvious that the Flash players garbage collector would have a hard time releasing unused resources when event listeners were present i.e. added but never removed. p  pThis led to a standard practice of defining and systematically calling destructorlike methods for all types that acted as event listeners. The latter were responsible for removing all listeners that were added at initializationtime. As a side effect, this required forgoing the use of unnamed functions as event listeners as all addEventListenersomeMethod calls had to be matched by a symmetrical removeEventListenersomeMethod. Another alternative would be using weak references.p  pNow, moving on to Javascript, judging from how integral unnamed functions and closures are to the language, their widespread use as event listeners, as well as the general lack of listenerrelated cleanup code to be found on the internet, it seems that the aforementioned shortcomings of Actionscripts runtime are not shared by the browser. p  pSpecifically, in the case of plain Javascript and DOM events, I have come to understand that when some part of the document is destroyed, the GC will release all related resources regardless of whether any listeners are attached something that is not true for AS and its document, the displaylist. p  pI suppose that the same holds for jQuery which primarily deals with the DOM factoring in the possibility that jQuery internally performs its own cleanup in some cases.p  pIs this correctp  pAnd what about dealing with custom events and their listeners which dont originate from the document but are defined and triggered using some library, such as Backbones Event module or the Node.js EventEmitter Should one expect a similar cleanup functionality for free or is this clearly a different case where one should take care to remove any added event listeners from dead objects in order to avoid memory leaksp  pIf this feels too generic, Id be happy to provide concrete examples as a basis for further discussionp  pThanks.p

Negative 982 pFirst let me say that I have been working on this issue for about 2 weeks and I have looked all over the place for an answer. Ive gone to various forums, blogs, the WordPress Codex and just about any and all places I could find. I still cannot get this to work properly. As a last resort I am coming here to see if maybe someone can assist me with it.p  pMy issue is this. I am building a free Wordpress theme, a hrefhttpwpawesome.themeawesome.com relnofollowhttpwpawesome.themeawesome.coma. I will be submitting it to the WordPress Theme Repository and hopefully get it hosted so people can download it. One of the requirements is that a theme cannot generate any errors. Everything is working perfectly and there are no errors except one. I get the following error message when I go to a second pagep  pstrongNotice Undefined variable donotduplicate in wpawesomeindex.php on line 68strongp  pAs you can see on the front page there is a featured post slider. This slider is will display posts that are tagged featured. I am using the following code for this specific queryp  precode    ltphp              mytag  mythemeoption featuredtag              thecount  mythemeoption featuredcount              myquery  new WPQuerytagmytagampshowpoststhecount             while myquerygthaveposts  myquerygtthepost             donotduplicate[]  postgtID         gt   post stuff here  ltphp endwhile gt codepre  pNow obviously on the home page I do not want the posts that are displaying in the slider to display on the front page in the regular loop below it. So i found the following code that seems to work greatp  precode    ltphp  if ishome       paged  getqueryvarpaged  getqueryvarpaged  1     querypostsarray         postnotin gt donotduplicate,         paged gt paged       if haveposts  while haveposts  thepost gt   post stuff  ltphp endwhile gt codepre  pthe only problem is when you click on another page at the bottom the error shows upp  pstrongNotice Undefined variable donotduplicate in wpawesomeindex.php on line 68strongp  pI know the error is appearing because when you go to a second or third page, there is nothing defining the donotduplicate param. Any ideas how to fix thisp  pAny help is greatly appreciated and I thank you in advance.p

Negative 982 pI have a library written with C that uses standard streams to read and write objects. I also have a Python interface generated with Swig that Im using to access the library. Everything works fine on Linux, but on Windows on MinGW it seems impossible to use C standard streams in binary mode through the Python interface. If the streams are used in text mode, the extra CR characters break the library. The standard streams are fully wrapped inside the C library, i.e. Im not passing them through the Python interface.p  pI have tried a solution that works in C programs that use the library, i.e. adding the linesp  precodeinclude ltfcntl.hgt int CRTfmode  OBINARY codepre  pinside the blockp  precode define SWIGFILEWITHINIT ...  codepre  pin the Swig libfoo.i file, but it has no effect.

Negative 982 pWhat is the best practice for cross platform apps animation I have an app that has many animation, all of them in big resolutions and lots of frames. I looked into most of the cross platform engines like Unity and Corona and non of them really suits my requirements  were talking about 2D animation and when I tried using simply png frames and sprite sheets, the apps size went rediculesly huge. I also tried exporting flash animations to html5 and although it worked very well weighs almost nothing, it showed very poor performances.p  pEDIT to elaboratep  pVideo is of course an option, but I suppose theres a better solution, isnt there Keep in mind that my animation has to happen on top of other things, like a background layer. Even if I did create a semitransparent video, it would still be very not trivial to play it in an app without a platformnative player with controls etc. It is kind of a 2d game. Lets say I have background image and Im showing an animation clip on top of it whenever the user touches some button. Hoping to have a crossplatform app that supports multiple and high resolutions, sprite sheets might be huge. Lets say I have an animation with half screen size and transparency, just this one sprite sheet can be huge in dimensions and weigh few MBsp  pWhat do you sayp

Negative 982 pHi I need to use ACL in a situation where user can only login through third party service like facebook google etc and their are only two roles guest and user. Right now I am using ZendAuthenticationStorageSession to store user object in session after authentication, but I dont want to apply checks on my every action to know the status of user. I want to keep it simple by using a simple access control list. I have checked many modules like zfcUser etc but they are far more complex than what I actually need. I tried to build my own ACL plugin but the documentation is not good enough and the tutorials on zf2 ACL are focusing on different cases. p  pThanks in Advance for your helpp

Negative 982 pI am attempting to rotate a gauge based on data that I am acquiring from a Serial Port. The Serial communications are working well and now I am having issues making the gauge rotate. I am now trying to make the image rotate with a slider bar and I am still having no luck. I currently have a timer implemented to trigger every 100 ms and run this code. However when I move the sliderBar nothing happens to the image on the screen. The reason I am using a timer is because that is what I will be using for my final implementation. Using a timer to trigger the UI update instead of the Serial event makes the application run much more smooth.p  pAs always any help is greatly appreciatedp  pin the constructor...p  precode public Form1              InitializeComponent         System.ComponentModel.ComponentResourceManager resources  new System.ComponentModel.ComponentResourceManagertypeofForm1         imgpic  ImagepictureBoxBase.Image.Clone  This is storing an image in a picture box...         foreach int rate in baudRates                      brbox.Items.Addrate                  timer.Tick  new EventHandlertimerTick         timer.Interval  100         timer.Enabled  true         timer.Start          com.DataReceived  new SerialDataReceivedEventHandlerOnReceived      codepre  pThen in the timer event...p  precode   void timerTickobject sender, EventArgs e  Again it is initially drawing the picture, but it does not rotate with the statusBar               Point test  new Point0, 0         Image img  new Bitmap400, 400          pictureBox1.Image  img         Graphics g  Graphics.FromImagepictureBox1.Image         Matrix mm1  new Matrix         mm1.RotateAttrackBar1.Value,new Point 0,0,MatrixOrder.Append         GraphicsPath gp  new GraphicsPath         gp.Transformmm1         gp.AddPolygonnew Point[]  new Point0, 0, new Pointimgpic.Width, 0, new Point0, imgpic.Height          PointF[] pts  gp.PathPoints         g.DrawImageimgpic, test         pictureBox1.Refresh       codepre

Negative 982 pI am attempting to write a process that will move a file from a directory on a server, to a network share, that will not be on that computer.  The methodology worked just fine when moving from my local machine to the network share.  However, it is not working when I put the process on my server this process is basically a dll, that gets picked up by a running service, the service spins up a thread, gives it to my process, and away it goes.  The process is running using an identity that has access to the shared directory, but it just wont move it.  I cant detect an exception occuring either.  I have pretty good logging in there and no exceptions seem to be thrown.  I will look closer, but has anyone tried to do anything like this before  I call either this...p  precodeFile.MoveCOutput  FileTitle, ShareDirectory    FileTitle codepre  pOr this...p  precode File.CopyCOutput  FileTitle, ShareDirectory    FileTitle, true codepre  pdepending on whether or not the file exists or not...

I get this exception...p  precodeException Publishing Document to Share System.UnauthorizedAccessException Access to the path is denied.      codepre  pOnce I saw that exception I decided to impersonate a valid user... And I am still getting that exception... Would mapping that directory on the server help at all I am guessing no, but I am running out of ideas.p  pstrongUPDATE when I impersonate myself vs other usersstrongp  pWhen I impersonate my self in the process I am able to successfully move the file to the share.  But If I impersonate another username that should have the same rights, I still get the above exception.  I am not certain why this is occurring.  Maybe this user doesnt have the permissions that I suspect it has.  But just looking in windows and looking at the LDAP server it appears as though it does.  Very curious indeed.p

Either that, or the msbuild exec sets its own console attributes.  Ive tried getting the parent console, but havent had any luck.p  pAny ideasp

Negative 982 pI just got stuck with the following problem. Im trying to construct a class but it isnt working. When Im constructing the class it uses namespaces and variables, because the variable has to be put behind a backslash for the namespace it gives an error. Heres an example code of defining the classp  precodeclassName  Help controller  new controllerclassName codepre  pThe class name is defined in a variable, in the example code above Ive just set it to Help. When constructing the class it has codecontrollercode in front of it, thats cause its in that namespace. If I remove the namespace thing away so it just hasp  precodecontroller  new className codepre  pit does work. The problem is probably caused because theres a backslash in front of the variable which contains the class name to construct. I am not able to add codeuse controllercode in the beginning of the code because the file containing the class is loaded inside the constructor, and the class is immediately constructed after the file has been loaded. The codeusecode function could only be used in the beginning of your file, not inside a method, I think.p  pI hope someone could help me out,.p  pThanks in advance, Tim Visep

Negative 982 pI am using  icarousel  to show coverflow in my project.. i am using uiview as an carousel item which contains labels and image view. The data for the carousel is coming from call to web service and i bind that data to the labels and image view of uiview which i used as an carousel item. Now issue is that as data from web service is large so it takes much time to load the data and bind it to icarousel, it almost freezes my app..  Now what i want is something like asynchronous downloading data and binding it to the icarousel so that it gets displayed immediately and user would not have to wait until all the data from the server is being downloaded..p  pAny help would be appreciated.. thanksp

Negative 982 pIm trying to calculate the days to the fourth available appointment as a measure in a cube.  Its an easy SQL query, however the users of this report have requested the ability to do dynamic adhoc analysis in a cube.   p  pDays to Fourth Available Appointment is defined as Order the available appointments in ascending order.  Pick the fourth row.  Take fourth available appointment  sysdate to arrive at the days to the fourth available appointment.   p  pThe grain of the fact table is at the appointment level.  The dimensions are for person, organization, date, and time.p  pWhere I keep getting stumped well, admittedly theres more than one thing stumping me is that depending on where you are in the hierarchy and what constraints youve applied, the fourth available appointment will be constantly changing.  You cant calculate at an atomic level and aggregate from there since the days to fourth appointment changes depending on the appointments being included in the ordered list. p  pCan anyone suggest to me how I would do something like this in a SSAS cube  I really dont even know where to begin, so any suggestions would be appreciated.p

Negative 982 pIs using codevacations.findli.lastcode is a better practice than codevacations lilastcodep  pBackground and my thoughtsp  pI was playing with a nice interactive a hrefhttptry.jquery.comlevels2sections11try jQuery tutoriala and one of the tasks saysp  blockquote   pAs you are looking through your code, you notice that someone else is selecting the last vacation with vacations lilast. You look at this and you think, Traversal would make this way faster You should act on those thoughts, refactor this code to find the last li within vacations using traversal instead.p blockquote  pWhy would I think so For me usage of selectors looks a bit higher level than traversing. In my mind when I am specifying a selector it is up to jQuery how to better get the single result I need without need in returning interim results.p  pWhat is that extra overhead of using composite selectors Is it because current implementation of selectors logic just parses the string and uses the traversal API Is parsing a string that slow Is there a chance that a future implementation will use that fact that it does not need to return interim results and will be faster than traversalp

Negative 982 pIn our company, we work together with several database systems MySQL, MSSQL, PLSQL, SQlite and SQLCe for various projects. Because of this, we developed a library that puts everything into a nice interface where we can connect to each database without worrying about which database is now behind. But this library always required to install every database on a clients computer because .Net insisted that because of the references. So we used MEF to create database plugins where the application only loads the appropriate plugin at startup and we dont need any other database systems installed on the host system.p  pAnyway, we still struggle because of the differences of each database. Lets say we want to have procedures that automatically generate required tables and data in the destination database if they arent available. Or if the different databases uses different datatypes. Things are getting very complicated and as for now, were interested in also using LINQ2SQL which doesnt seem to be able to handle MySQL, SQlite and PLSQL.p  pMy questionp  pIs there any freeoss C library that takes over this tasks Where we can have full control over our databases without thinking about which database is now behindp

Negative 982 pI have another issue with Universal Image loader. Trying to use it in a listview and gridview for displaying large amount of images. The urls passed to UIL contain high res images.

Negative 982 pIs there a simple way to use ASP.NET Web APIs default serializerp  pMine is configured in that fashion in WebApiConfig.csp  precodeconfig.Formatters.JsonFormatter.SerializerSettings.Converters.Addnew StringEnumConverter config.Formatters.JsonFormatter.SerializerSettings.ContractResolver  new CamelCasePropertyNamesContractResolver codepre  pIt works perfectly. What I would like to do is use the very same serializer manually in a specific situation. If for some reason that config changes, the manual serialization must reflect those changes without having to care about it.p  pTo be more precise about my intentions, I want to send new resources to a SignalR Hub just after theyve been saved to the database. They need to be serialized in the same exact way that ASP.NET Web API does when using a GET request.p
Negative 982 pI have 2 activities, normally I open activity A which then opens activity B. p  pIn the case that a user clicks on a notification and the application is not running at all then B opens first. However when the users clicks the upactionbackHome button the user should be taken back to A. I have done this by overwritting the upactionbarHome button and starting activity A and calling finish on B. This works fine as if the user clicks back they exit the app as normal.p  pThe problem is after that, when the user selects this task from the task manager, activity B opens. How can I ensure activity A opens in this casep  pstrongEditstrongp  pSo I think the problem is that when I exist the app after I opened it via a notification, the app is still in the task manager. So if I enter the app via the task manager it starts it up in the same way it did from the notification. How do I stop this behaviourp

Negative 982 pIm developing a .net client application which uses Entity Framework to access the database. It is a multiuser application where sometimes there are no changes for hours possibly days and sometimes there are hundreds of changes at once.p  pI need to cache pretty much data because of some checks which need to be done and displayed to the user. I solved the problem of one cache updating the others when something changes within one application instance. However Im not sure what is the best way to go when the change happens in an other instance of the application.p  pI tried to use codeSqlDependencycode to invalidate my caches but that can force me to reload very much data when only one bit has changed. Not very good for performance. Also it fires when the application which uses the codeSqlDependecycode changes something at the data so one change gets a cache updated twice.p  pSince I never developed something with that amount of caching Im at a loss of how Id best proceed.

In reality, i add a partially colored background on a risk period only on years where toxicity of th shelfish is observed so that i can compare parameters on toxic years precisely on risk period and non toxic years on the entire year. so my code is testing if the year is toxic, and if so, it add a color background on the risk periode. I did not put it before because my error occurs even without this test, and i mention it now because it explains why i cant use facets grid  or can i is there a way i can add partially colored background only on some facetsp

Negative 982 pI was reading on the different transaction isolation levels, and came up across the codeSERIALIZABLEcode isolation level. I also know that databases such as Postgres, Oracle and MySQL support the codeSELECT .. FOR UPDATEcode syntax.p  pI am however confused how these should be used when I would like to lock a row or a range of rows which I wish to perform updates on. p  pWhen using JPA in the past, I always used codeTransactionalcode coupled with a codeLockModeType.PESSIMISTICWRITEcode on the query. This translates to using a codeREADCOMMITTEDcode isolation level with a codeSELECT .. FOR UPDATEcode in SQL.p  pBut now, having read about codeSERIALIZABLEcode, Im wondering what would be different if I used codeTransactionalisolationSERIALIZABLEcode with a normal codeSELECTcode e.g. emem.findByIdem to fetch a detached entity, followed by an codeUPDATEcode merge of the entity.p  pWould the behavior be the samep  pSay for example, I have a Bank system, and I wish to transfer money between two accounts. I require these accounts not to be meddled with, while the transfer is in progress. So, suppose I debit one account with 100 and credit it into the other account. What would be the best way to ensure that these accounts are available only to the transaction performing the updatep  pAssume that Im manipulating JPA detached entities, so prior to updating, I will have to read them from the DB, e.g. emfindByIdem.p  ul liUse codeTransactionalisolationREADCOMMITTEDcode, emem.findByIdem with codeLockModeType.PESSIMISTICWRITEcode i.e. codeSELECT ..

Negative 982 pSuppose I am testing a method which has a dependency on a imported singleton instance called WS Web Service, which has a method, emurlurl Stringem, which takes a URL and returns a request.    p  precodedef doRequesturl String Future[Response]     val request  WS.urlurl   for      response lt request.postparams    yield      val res JsResult[MyResult]  response.json.validate[MyResult]     res.getOrElsethrow new NotSupportedException     codepre  pI would like to be able to inject the WS dependency such that my unit tests do not require an actual outbound http request, but can instead depend on a mock WS instance. p  pThis has been a challenge for me because, while a singleton technically emdoesem have a type Class[WS.type], the WSs properties and methods are lost when binding the singleton to a val which expects a Class[WS.type]. This means that I cannot simply use a simple cake pattern, like sop  precodetrait WSComponent    val ws Class[ lt WS.type]   object ApplicationContext extends WSComponent    val ws  WS   object TestContext extends WSComponent    val ws  mock[WS]  codepre  pIf I do this, and then make calls to WSs methods in either context, I get a compilation error, which is that Class[ lt WS.type] has no method called for example url.p  pFor what seems like a similar reason basically, singleton objects dont have typeseven though they do, I cannot provide an implicit parameter which takes a WS.type, because, again, I will lose the methods and properties that were declared on the singleton object.p  pWhat approaches are there for injecting dependencies on singleton objects I enjoy using the cake pattern for DI, but it introduces quite a bit of boilerplate to my code, so the ideal solution would not compound the code with too much more boilerplate.p  pThank you in advance for any suggestions.p

Negative 982 pA single swipe gesture is intended by Apple to move the VoiceOver cursor through screen items in order but mine dont because the user can move them aroundp  pMy main view has a set of buttons and labels, however it also has two collections of custom subviews, lets call the instances SVA1 to SVA9 amp SVB1 to SVB9 in ascending order from left to right. That is, SVA is one custom UIView class and SVB is the 2nd. When I drag, say, SVA3 to the current position of SVA6 then I end up with an order of SVA1, SVA2, SVA4, SVA5, SVA3, SVA6, SVA7, SVA8 amp SVA9. The collections are linked so that that same order would now also be mirrored in the SVB subview collection via my code.p  pMy problem is that swiping to the right, expecting VoiceOver to read out my items as I see them on screen results in a different order. It gets quite a lot of them right but then will suddenly move the VoiceOver cursor from the first collection to the 2nd or change its direction. After a move my code is aware of the new order of all the subviews but Id like to be able to get that information to VoiceOver.p  pEach custom subview is an accessibilityElement. Is there a way that I can tell VoiceOver to read back my items in the order Id expect Ive come across the accessibilityElementAtIndex method but dont see whether or how that fits with my situation.p  pThank you.p

I am trying to figure out if there is a good algorithm or maybe an existing package.p  pI wrote a function, which runs a Monte Carlo simulation, gets called 1,000,000,000 times, and returns a 64 bit floating number at the end of each run. Below is the said functionp  precodedef MonteCarlodf,head,span      Pick initial truck     rndtruck  np.random.randint0,lendf     fulllength  df[length][rndtruck]     fullweight  df[gvw][rndtruck]       Loop using other random trucks until the bridge is full     while True         rndtruck  np.random.randint0,lendf         fulllength  head  df[length][rndtruck]         if fulllength gt span             break         else             fullweight  df[gvw][rndtruck]       Return average weight per feet on the bridge     returnfullweightspan codepre  pcodedfcode is a Pandas dataframe object having columns labeled as codelengthcode and codegvwcode, which are truck lengths and weights, respectively. codeheadcode is the distance between two consecutive trucks, codespancode is the bridge length. The function randomly places trucks on the bridge as long as the total length of the truck train is less than the bridge length. Finally, calculates the average weight of the trucks existing on the bridge per foot total weight existing on the bridge divided by the bridge length.p  pAs a result I would like to build a tabular histogram showing the distribution of the returned values, which can be plotted later. I had some ideas in mindp  ol lipKeep collecting the returned values in a numpy vector, then use existing histogram functions once the MonteCarlo analysis is completed. This would not be feasable, since if my calculation is correct, I would need 7.5 GB of memory for that vector only 1,000,000,000 64 bit floats  7.5 GBpli lipInitialize a numpy array with a given range and number of bins. Increase the number of items in the matching bin by one at the end of each run. The problem is, I do not know the range of values I would get. Setting up a histogram with a range and an appropriate bin size is an unknown. I also have to figure out how to assign values to the correct bins, but I think it is doable.pli lipDo it somehow on the fly. Modify ranges and bin sizes each time the function returns a number. This would be too tricky to write from scratch I think.pli ol  pWell, I bet there may be a better way to handle this problem. Any ideas would be welcomep  pOn a second note, I tested running the above function for 1,000,000,000 times only to get the largest value that is computed the code snippet is below. And this takes around an hour when codespan  200code. The computation time would increase if I run it for longer spans the while loop runs longer to fill the bridge with trucks. Is there a way to optimize this you thinkp  precodemaxw  0 i  1     while i lt 1000000000         if maxw lt MonteCarlodfbasic, 15., 200.             maxw  MonteCarlodfbasic, 15., 200.     i  1 print maxw codepre  pThanksp

The field originally produces a calendar, from which a user can select an appropriate date, but that seems like a more complicated endeavour to emulate than inserting the appropriate date value directly.p  pThe pages source code looks like thisp  precodeltdiv classdijitReset dijitInputFieldgt ltinput idformdateDateTextBox0 classdijitReset typetext autocompleteoff dojoattachpointtextbox,focusNode tabindex0 ariarequiredtruegt ltinput typehidden value20131126 sliceindex0gt codepre  pwhere codevalue20131126code is the field Im trying to inject a value its originally empty, ie codevaluecode.p  pI understand that WebDriver is not able to insert a value into a hidden input, because regular users would not be able to do that in a browser, but a workaround is to use Javascript.

Negative 982 pI am reading the book  Artificial Intelligence a modern approach. I came across this sentence describing the time complexity of uniform cost search p  blockquote   pUniformcost search is guided by path costs rather than depths, so its   complexity is not easily characterized in terms of b and d. Instead,   let C be the cost of the optimal solution,7 and assume that every   action costs at least . Then the algorithms worstcase time and   space complexity is Ob1C, which can be much greater than bd.p blockquote  pAs to my understanding, C is the cost of the optimal solution, and every action costs at least , so that C would be the number of steps take to the destination. But I dont know how this complexity is resulted, thanks.p

Negative 982 pI have a curious problem ...p  pI created a new project with xcode 5 , I deleted storyboards , since im working with xibs , and I removed the base localization because , from what Ive read, its useless with the xibs .

After some tests I realized that the problem stems from the language settings , in fact if I set the language of the simulator in Italian , everything works properly. Analyzing the situation better , I realized that some variables set in the file  Localizable.strings  and crucial for the application are not read correctly  it sets the key and not the value  and for this reason the app crashes .p  pIm pretty confident i can solve the problem by simply creating a new project and copying in the code, but I would like to know if it is possible to recover the original.p  pAny help will be appreciated thanksp  pstrongEDITstrongp  pstrong1st Trystrong Checked the button base localization in projectinfo is opening an empty popup window no files to localizep  pstrong2nd Trystrong In projectinfo, under localization press  to add base localization i have only italian now seems nothing changed ... it still open an empty windowp  pFollow some screenshotsp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.com8nq2L.png altThe Italian Localizationp  pAs u can see there is 1 file localized, wich is the Localizable.strings, and the check button Use base Internationalization unchecked.p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comRIY7X.png altBase Localization Windowp  pHere u can see what happen either when i check Use base Internationalization or i add the Base language by pressing the  button under Localizations.p  pstrongEDIT 2strongp  pTryed same things with iOS Deployment Target 7.0 instead of 4.3.

The Dialog should be up for the whole 20 seconds instead of only 3 seconds. Also when the dialog closes, it already goes to the next intent. While it actually should go to the next intent in 20 seconds instead of 3 seconds.p

Negative 982 pWe just updated our project to use Glass.Mapper V3. We LOVE it. But weve encountered an issue. It doesnt seem to respect language fallback. p  pWe have our site set up so that if a user picks a nondefault language, they will see the item of that language if it exists. If not, they will see the default fallback language version. We have also set this up at the field level, so that if there is a nondefault version of an item but not all the fields are changed, any unchanged fields will fall back to the default language versions value for that field.p  pIs there anything we can do to enable Glass to use language fallbackp

Negative 982 pI am currently developing a android game with AndEngine. It really works great so far, except for one problem i cannot seem to figure out how to solve.  Every time i upload the game to my phone to debug and let it start, the gameplay movement freezes or goes extremely slow for a couple of seconds and a threadid4 reacting to signal 3 message appears in the LogCat.  If i then close the game and start it up again from the phone itself not with eclipse it seems to be completely fine. Reading about that message i pulled the log from the device but i am unable to find out how to tackle this problem.

This is confusing and annoying.emp  pstrongMy first attempt at a fix was to set the body to overflowhidden and positionfixed whenever the navigation is open. Example herestrong emHad to remove link because maximum 2 links in postemp  pemThis, however, causes the body to snap back to the top and forget its scroll position. This means you are taken back to the top of the page whenever you open the navigation. Not good.emp  pstrongLastly, my best solution so far is one where i put all the page content inside a scrollareadiv with a fixed position taking up most of the screen, and body scroll set to hidden. Example herestrong a hrefhttpaudunaas.nomenu relnofollowhttpaudunaas.nomenuap  pThis solves most of the problems in the page itself, but breaks the memory of the back button. This means whenever you click back in your browser you are taken to the top of the page instead of back to where you were before you decided to click a link. Mobile safari seems to be the only browser that remembers scroll position on divs aswell as bodyp  pI cant really think of any more solutions to this, except for maybe some sort of javascript. strongDoes anyone have some experience with similar cases, or any ideas on how to accomplish thisstrongp  pstrongThe solution muststrongp  ul liPrevent scrolling on page content when navigation is openli liPreserve scroll position on page content when navigation is openli liRemember scroll position on previous page when backbutton is usedli ul

Negative 982 pThe project Im working on is a set of tools for users to manage their own accounts. For example, generic users will be able to access and update their Drive or calendars, and for administrators they can additionally get lists of their users and groups and manage those.p  pMy concern is the API limits. At this point in time the projects client ID and secret are hardcoded because I want users to just be able to download and run the tools which is working great until someone queries all users and uses up half of the daily limit for one of the APIs. I realize I can request more API calls, but Im not sure thats the best solution.p  pIn order to have each user on their own API limits, will I need to have each person using it set up a new Google Code project with its own set of limits Or is there a way to allow the same project to have limits based on domain Im not sure what best practice is.p  pEdit I should mention Im authenticating via OAuth2.0 using 2legged authentication, as my understanding was that was the best way to do it for administrators and users... should I be using 3legged insteadp

Negative 982 pI have some functionality that traverses the filesystem recursively using codeFindFirstFilecode and codeFindNextFilecode.  This works fine, but the problem is that on occasion it comes across some kind of recursive link.  For example, codeCfoobarcode links to codeCfoocode.  Most of these links are implemented with reparse points, so it is enough to avoid traversing into a folder with the codeFILEFLAGREPARSEPOINTcode attribute set.  However, on rare occasions one of these links will NOT have that flag set and thus the code gets stuck in an endless loop until the stack is exhausted.p  pMy question is how can I detect these links in order to avoid endlessly traversing into themp  pUnfortunately I do not have access to an environment that reproduces the problem so I cant gather any more information all I have to go on are some crash dumps from Windows Error Reporting.  I have seen these nonreparse links on local NTFS filesystems, and possibly also on remote SMB file systems but Im not 100 on that.p  pstrongEDITstrong More details from one of the dumps.p  pIn one case the problem folder is codeCusersAdministratorAppDataLocalApplication Datacode.  Here the codeApplication Datacode part repeats over 700 times, and the total length of the path is 12K characters 24k bytes.  Due to local variables the stack is exhausted well before the 32K limit is reached.  This is a Windows 7 machine and the filesystem is NTFS, so normally codeApplication Datacode is a junction to codeAppDataLocalcode.  However, my code is not detecting this particular folder as a junction.  In the logs I can see it is detecting other junctions, so this leads me to believe it is an environmental issue.p

Negative 982 pIn an existing SSRS 2008 r2 report, I have the following IIFRowNumberNothing Mod 2  0, Gainsboro, White for the background color for every other detail line row.

Negative 982 pIm attempting to create a customized JProgressBar that utilizes the JLayer class so that it can be colored differently depending on the situation, a la a hrefhttpstackoverflow.coma17208900742504this solutiona.  The thing is that I want to wrap it up as a JComponent of some sort since it makes it more manageable.  I would expose it as a customized JLayer, but that class is sealed, so nothing doing.p  pIve tried just making it a JComponent, but nothing is drawn on the screen probably because I have no idea how to make a custom JComponent that contains other components inside of it.  Ive tried a JFrame, which works, but the sizing is all wrong, likely because the progress bar is using the layout manager of the JFrame I made instead of the layout manager containing the JFrame.

Negative 982 pWhile coding you could use Java as a referenceexample, as I am most familiar with it how do you manage to have several actions happen at the same time, continually I understand with enough loopsbooleans, you can set simple code to continually happen with different outputs based on various inputs but that isnt quite what I mean. As far as Ive learned, code has been quite sequential which is good, but I mean purely, concretely sequential. For example, for some kind of conversion calculator ask for input, receive input deal with incorrect input, convert, display, ask for another conversion finish.p  pHowever, for more complex codes, I would like to know how to allow for various actions events to happen at the same time, or the possibility of such. For example, mobile apps. allow for settings to be changed at nearly any given time, not waiting for a specific time in the programs run to ask for a change of settings. Likewise, video games allow for input at any given time, while other actions are still happening such as moving while jumping and allowing for AIenemies to interact. Yes, the code still has to follow sequences, but how do I simultaneously have various inputsoutputs or actions occur while running other processesprocedures all in the same programp  pIn short, the best way I can think of to describe what I am asking is  how do I have multiple programs code to run in one project at the same timep

Negative 982 pI am not sure if this is the right place to ask for such concept information advice, so I apologise if its unrelated or offtopic to ask in Stack Overflow.p  pI want to develop an application in WPF which has the ability to draw polygons with the functionality of a regular control, they may change shape by adding, removing or moving vertices, change brushes all by runtime, from databinding or perhaps direct manipulating from C code still not sure about that. p  pWhat I am trying to achieve is an application which draws a map and the shapes on it are the entities with the dynamic borders over the map for instance say political borders. The polygons also have to be clickable controls with collision test not just a bounding box, but exactly by the shape of the entity on the map. I can expect the shapes to be very detailed because of borders which found by rivers and mountains or other natural objects which not just a straight line of two vertices, so its performance should be an important factor here because one polygon may contain hundreds of vertices.p  pWhat Ive concluded that it is possible to achieve via WPF such an application. But my uncertainty is on the most efficient way to implement the map drawing, perhaps I should implement D3D hosting like SharpDX but I dont want it, it would make things even more complicated and difficult.p  pI prefer everything in this map to be functional as a regular WPF control with its databinding and stylising abilities. Ive developed with WPF some several small test projects for months to learn the basics and its main concept. But now comes the main interest of mine to develop with WPF. I need some advice please, because drawing complicated and dynamic shapes is still not really clear to me to just go on and start develop it.p

Negative 982 pTried to search through in stackoverflow but doesnt find any solution to my problem. So here it goes.I am a beginner to RoR and ajaxp  pI wanted my Forum posts to auto submit in an interval of 30 seconds when the user is actually typing the post. Well apparently this can be achieved using ajax. The main intention of inventing this is to let other users able to read the incomplete post even while the author is typing it. So i figured out that I can do this,p  pIF the user is typing, I will submit the post every 30 seconds. IF the user is done typing and submitted the post, well, he will be redirected to the topic with his post shown.p  pThere is a problem here as we can see, auto submitting at here leads to duplicated post. So I came up with an idea to redirect the user to a edit page, at the first time when the ajax is run.The problem is that the redirect does not work.After the first ajax submits, the page is not redirected, while the log shows that edit.html.erb is rendered.What is the problem here Or maybe I can have a better solution to my approachp  pCodes for the redirectto partp  precodedef create topic  Topic.findparams[topicid] post  topic.posts.buildparams[post] post.forum  topic.forum post.user  currentuser  if post.save   if request.xhr     flash[notice]  Post was saved     redirectto editpostpathpost   else     flash[notice]  Post was successfully created.     redirectto topicpathpost.topic   end else   render action gt new end end codepre  pCodes for the auto savingp  precodefunction  if newpost.length gt 0      setTimeoutautoSavePost, 30000            function autoSavePost      for instance in CKEDITOR.instances         CKEDITOR.instances[instance].updateElement  .ajax type POST, url ..posts, data newpost.serialize, dataType script, success functiondata  console.logdata   setTimeoutautoSavePost, 30000  codepre  pCodes in applicationcontroller.rbp  precodedef redirecttooptions  , responsestatus   if request.xhr    renderedit page page.redirecttooptions else    superoptions, responsestatus end end codepre  pAny help is appreciated.

However, the minute you use the socalled Custom User Model flavor of authentication as outlined in the above link...emandem then pair that with a custom backend in order to use emails for usernames...you run into trouble due to the absence of access to the typical authenticate function.  p  pFor example, like so...p  h3accounts.models.pyh3  pbrp  pre  ...with postgres, Id subclass AbstractBaseUser...but with Mongo...  from django.conf import settings from mongoengine.fields import EmailField, BooleanField br from mongoengine.django.auth import User  class MyUserUser      email  EmailFieldmaxlength254, uniqueTrue     isactive  BooleanFielddefaultTrue     isadmin  BooleanFielddefaultFalse      USERNAMEFIELD  email     REQUIREDFIELDS        ...  pre  pbrp  h3mycustombackend.pyh3  pre  ...is a custom backend even necessary to use email for authentication instead of username  from django.conf import settings from django.contrib.auth.models import checkpassword from mongoengine.django.auth import checkpassword from django.contrib.auth.hashers import checkpassword from models import MyUser      class EmailAuthBackendobject          def authenticateself, emailNone, passwordNone   ...uh oh, since Im NOT using one of the usual backends with a preexisting authenticate  method, there aint a native checkpassword function available. Means I have to hash the  password, etc. pre  pSo, emseeminglyem, Im obliged to write my own checkpassword function. To get all of the  goodness inherent with the emAbstractBaseUserem class typically found with a PostgreSQL authentication, Id have to totally inflate my custom User model, which seems hacky and cant be very DRY. p  pAm I getting totally confused here ...i.e., is it actually totally unnecessary to use a custom backend if I want to use emails instead of usernames for authentication when using MongoEngine p  pI feel like I may have a fundamental misunderstanding of how Django works with MongoEngine in regard to authentication, and with regard to how Ive modeled and called upon custom user object  my particular subclassing of MongoEngines user object during that process...p  pBecauseas it is right nowIm getting an strongAnonymousUser object has no attribute backendstrong error message in the browser. I also noted that this problem sometimes exists for unexpected reasonsnamely perhaps, the authenticate method expects a hashed password, or because the login email is too long...

Negative 982 pWe are using System.Reflection.Emit to generate code at runtime from source code yes  as in a compiler. We provide correct symbol information to the ILGenerator with MarkSequencePoint etc, and enable all debug flags on the AssemblyBuilder. The assembly is kept in memory in the same process that compiled it and is executed directly.p  pWhen using the Visual Studio debugger to step through the source for the dynamically generated code it actually works perfectly, and Visual Studio seems to be fully aware of where code comes from in terms of files and line numbers.p  pHOWEVER  When emexceptionsem are thrown by the emgenerated codeem, the System.Exception objects contain stack traces that are completely wrong. They point to other valid, but wrong files and line numbers. It gets the class and method name right, but the file and line number pointed to has nothing to do with the code path the exception actually came from. p  pThe files pointed to are so unrelated it seems it cant be linked to inlining or optimizations. The only pattern I can spot is that it seems to be offset by some files in an imaginary alphabetically sorted list of source files the assembly was built from. However, this pattern is not 100 consistent, and it seems irrational that this is linked to the source of the problem.p  pIf i construct a System.Diagnostics.Debug object from the Exception, it contains the same faulty information.p  pI am assuming that the .NET runtime uses the same metadata to construct Exception stack traces as the debugger uses for stepping through the code, in which case this behavior is really weird.p  pIm trying to find out if this is a known bug in .NET when dealing with dynamic inmemory assemblies, or if anyone has seen similar problems in other areas.p

Negative 982 pIm Writing a windows store app using C and XAML. One of my pages is a split page with a listview where the user can select an item and then the details for that item will be displayed in a details card next to the list.p  pThe problem is that the listview doesnt maintain scroll position when I do a suspend and shutdown from Visual studio and then resume the app. The item that was selected is gets selected and its details are shown but the scroll position is not updated. It works fine with just a suspend and resume.p  pWhen I save the state of the page upon suspend I save the selected items index in the list. When the app is resumed I let LoadState do a MoveCurrentToPositionselectedIndex where selectedIndex is the saved index. This makes the correct item selected. Ive tried using ScrollIntoView to update the scroll position with no effect. I had the same problem with the search functionality but in that case ScrollIntoView solved my problem.p  pHave anyone else encountered this problem Is it a known problem and what can you do about it when ScrollIntoView doesnt workp

Negative 982 pI am having this problem when doing a simple orientation test.p  pSuppose I am using a design resolution of 480320 for landscape and 320480 for portrait mode.

Negative 982 pIm attempting to clean up an existing application by writing unit tests for some legacy code and updating it along the way. Ive rewritten a number of libraries and Ive really been loving the TDD approach. However, now its time to move on to testing some controllers, and Ive run into a problem on the very first set of tests. Im following the explanations in Jeffery Ways emLaravel Testing Decodedem.p  pThe goal here is to test my login route codehttpmydevelopmentserverlogincode. The code should work like this first, check to see if someone is already logged in  if they are, redirect them to the dashboard the main page in the app. Otherwise, render the login page. Pretty straight forward.p  pHere are the routes involvedp  precodeRoutegetlogin, array         as        gt login,         uses      gt MyAppControllersAccountControllergetLogin,       Routeget, array         as        gt dashboard,         uses      gt MyAppControllersDashboardControllershowDashboard,         before    gt acldashboard.view,      codepre  pHeres the codeAccountControllergetLogincode methodp  precodepublic function getLogin       Are we logged in     if Sentrycheck         return Redirectroutedashboard       Show the page.     return Viewmakeaccount.login  codepre  pIm using the codeSentrycode library for user authentication.p  pAnd heres my first testp  precodeclass AccountControllerTest extends TestCase       public function tearDown              Mockeryclose           public function testloginalreadyLoggedIn               arrange                  SentryshouldReceivecheck             gtonce             gtandReturntrue           act                  response  thisgtcallGET, login           assert                  thisgtassertRedirectedToRoutedashboard       codepre  pThis test emulates the user attempts to log in when theyre already logged in case. codecheckcode returns true already logged in and the user is redirected to the route named codedashboardcode. It works perfectly, test passes.p  pNext, I add a new test, to test the user attempts to log in when nobodys logged in case. Heres the code for that testp  precodepublic function testloginnotLoggedIn       arrange          SentryshouldReceivegetUser         gttwice         gtandReturnnull      SentryshouldReceivecheck         gtonce         gtandReturnfalse       act          response  thisgtclientgtrequestGET, login       assert          h2  responsegtfilterh2      thisgtassertEqualsPlease sign in, h2gttext  codepre  pWhen I run this test, the first test passes but I get a codeNotFoundHttpExceptioncode in the second test method.p  pThere are a couple of strange things about this problemp  ol lipif I comment out the first test method codetestloginalreadyLoggedIncode, the second test passes.pli lipif I reverse the order of the two test methods, codetestloginnotLoggedIncode passes and codetestloginalreadyLoggedIncode fails ie. the first method in the class passes and the second fails.pli ol  pThis looks to me like some sort of configuration issue  after the first test which passes, something is messed up and it cannot make the request in the second test  but Im at a loss. Ive gone over the book several times and google but cant find any reference to any configuration that Im missing.p  pAny suggestionsp

Negative 982 pWhen I read the document I found the following notesp  blockquote   pWhen a sort immediately precedes a limit in the pipeline, the sort operation only maintains the top n results as it progresses, where n is the specified limit, and MongoDB only needs to store n items in memory.

Negative 982 pAfter I changed from ObjectContext to DbContext database first in a very big app, my server was going crazy about Garbage Collector, performance was a mess and lots of not reachable, timeout, and all flavors of nasty errors appeared.p  pAfter reading a lots, and profiled the server, found out that 50 of processor time was on Find method, so I removed the use of Find for a GetById which actually calls find but turns AutoDetectChanges to false then true. This was the first tweak that actually improves substantially the performance.p  pAfter that I profiled and see two methods being heavy used. both are Get of large collections imagine a GetProduct with lots of relationsp  pWent down to those methods and did the same, AutoDetectChanges to false while getting the data.p  pThose method are read only, so I guess its safe to turn off AutoDetectChanges.p  pBefore, with ObjectContext the application run smoothly. Thing is, our code is very like p  precodevar someEntityDTO  service.GetSomeEntityDTO...  Get a DTO service.SomeLogicsomeEntityDTO  Perform some logic, update, whatever. someEntityDTO.CreateUpdate codepre  pCreateUpdate method on DTO does map all properties from DTO to Entity, save changes and return Entity.p  psignature would be similar to this p  precodepublic SomeEntity CreateUpdate     var someEntity  context.FindByIdId     if someEntity  null        var someEntity  context.SomeEntities.Create     someEntity.Name  Name     someEntity.OtherProperty  OtherProperty     someEntity.OtherEntityCollection  OtherEntityCollectionDTO.CreateUpdate      .... BIG ETC including relations and lot of nasty stuff D     context.SaveChanges  codepre  pWhen loading collections, its like this p  precodevar entitiesDTOs  service.GetSomeEntityList codepre  pthe code inside the pseudo GetSomeEntityList is like this p  precodevar ret  context.SomeEntities.Where ....  return ret.Selectx gt new SomeEntityDTOx codepre  pand the constructor of the DTO is like p  precodepublic SomeEntityDTOSomeEntity entity       Id  entity.Id      Name  entity.Name      OtherEntityDTO  new OtherEntityDTOentity.OtherEntity      AnotherEntitiesDTO  entity.AnotherEntities.Selectxgt new AnotherEntityDTOx        ... ETC with more properties and Navigation.  codepre  pAs I understand, those mapping are BAD for EF 6 DbContext when tracking lots of objects.p  pAnother point of interest is that DbContext is created for each web request and passed along all methods called.p  pSo instead of the above code of geting a collection of DTOs, the real code is more like p  precodeentity.AnotherEntities.Selectxgt new AnotherEntityDTOcontext, x  codepre  pWhile I could improve the performance a lot with the tweaks, Im looking for some suggestion, considerations, help or comments about why my application went from smooth to chaotic and how can I improve the code practices to reach the smooth point again.p  pI tryied to simplify most of the code its not real code just for brevityclarity.

Negative 982 pI would like to normalize device motion so that a user holding the device in landscape at a 45 degree incline is treated as the neutral position 0,0,0. p  pThe idea here is to get smoother and more natural feeling motion for moving a sprite on screen.p  pWithout normalization what happens is that the relative motion accumulates in a way that after short time the user has to movehold the device in an odd way to place the sprite back in the center of the screen. Successfully getting the sprite back in the middle of the screen sort of resets it again for a time, so I am fairly certain all gyro rotations are relative to how the device is currently oriented the docs emseemem to be saying this as well. p  pI played with gravity a bit to see if there might be a way to use it to make a guess on how the device is oriented and using it as a correction. Not really sure that is going to lead anywhere.p  pSo, in summary I would like a defined orientation to always represent the middle and all rotations to be applied relative to this attitudeorientation. p  pHopefully that is clear enough. p  pHere is my classp  precodeimport CoreMotion import SpriteKit  let MotionManagerSharedInstance  MotionManager  class MotionManagerCMMotionManager      class var sharedInstanceMotionManager          return MotionManagerSharedInstance          func startMotionManager        if self.deviceMotionActive               self.startDeviceMotionUpdatesUsingReferenceFrameCMAttitudeReferenceFrameXArbitraryCorrectedZVertical, toQueue NSOperationQueue.currentQueue, withHandler                  deviceManager, error in                   func stopMotionManager      if self.deviceMotionActive          self.stopDeviceMotionUpdates        func radiansToDegreesradiansCGFloat, correctionCGFloat gt CGFloat      return CGFloatradians  CGFloat180.0  MPI  correction   func updatePositionnode SKNode      if let data  self.deviceMotion           let rollCorrectionCGFloat  8.0         let pitchCorrectionCGFloat  8.0          let forceX  self.radiansToDegreesradians CGFloatdata.rotationRate.x, correction rollCorrection         let forceY  self.radiansToDegreesradians CGFloatdata.rotationRate.y, correction pitchCorrection          node.physicsBody.applyImpulseCGVectorMakeforceX, forceY          codepre

See     lta hrefhttpintrocs.cs.princeton.edu15inoutgtSection 1.5ltagt of    ltigtIntroduction to Programming in Java An Interdisciplinary Approachltigt    by Robert Sedgewick and Kevin Wayne.    ltpgt    For uniformity across platforms, this class uses ltttgtLocale.USltttgt    for the locale and ltttgtUTF8ltttgt for the characterset encoding.    The English language locale is consistent with the formatting conventions    for Java floatingpoint literals, commandline arguments    via link DoubleparseDoubleString and standard output.    ltpgt    Like link Scanner, reading a ltemgttokenltemgt also consumes preceding Java    whitespace reading a line consumes the following endofline    delimeter reading a character consumes nothing extra.     ltpgt    Whitespace is defined in link CharacterisWhitespacechar. Newlines    consist of n, r, rn, and Unicode hex code points 0x2028, 0x2029, 0x0085    see ltttgtlta hrefhttpwww.docjar.comhtmlapijavautilScanner.java.htmlgt    Scanner.javaltagtltttgt NB Java 6u23 and earlier uses only r, r, rn.    ltpgt    See link In for a version that handles input from files, URLs,    and sockets.    ltpgt    Note that Javas UTF8 encoding does not recognize the optional byteorder    mask. If the input begins with the optional byteorder mask, ltttgtStdInltttgt    will have an extra character ltttgtuFEFFltttgt at the beginning.

Negative 982 pI am hosting my own server on my private Windows 8 machine.p  pI am looking to develop an online chat application as a part of a larger website i am developing. A simple Google search suggested using AJAX requests and a serverside chat HTML page, with the browser sending requests to fetch the page every so often via a Javascript loop.

Maybe something like this would workp  ul liServerside programscript listens on a port for incoming requests.li liBrowser sends an AJAX request to the server on the specified port whenever a user types in a message.li liServerside programscript records the message in a MySQL database or file.li liServer sends a ... something ... to the browser window.li liClient web page receives the something from the server via JS and formatsdisplays the message appropriately.li ul  pI have only had experience with static pages HTMLCSSJS in the past, and have just recently dabbled in PHP. So ... i naturally have some questions.p  ul liWhat port should i use Do i just pick a number and stick with it, or are there specific numbers that are meant for specific thingsli liCan i write the serverside program in CC I am pretty sure i could download and learn to use libraries that would interact with MySQL databases and send requests.

Negative 982 pIm getting weird results I cant explain from a codeBufferedReadercode when I vary the size of the buffer.p  pI had strongly expected that performance would gradually increase as I increased the size of the buffer, with diminishing returns setting in fairly quickly, and that thereafter performance would be more or less flat.

Negative 982 pSo a hrefhttpstackoverflow.coma4914635056Ive read many times beforea that technically .Net emdoesem support tail call optimization because it has the opcode for it, and just c doesnt generate it.p  pIm not exactly sure why TCO needs an opcode or what it would do. As far as I know, the requirement for being able to do TCO is that the results of a recursive call are not combined with any variables in the current function scope. If you dont have that, then I dont see how an opcode prevents you from having to keep a stackframe open. If you do have that, then cant the compiler always easily compile it to something iterativep  pSo what is the point of an opcode Obviously theres something Im missing. In cases where TCO is possible at all, cant it always be handled at the compiler level than at the opcode level Whats an example of where it cantp

Negative 982 piAd and AdMobs banner sizes only perfectly fit iPhone 4s and 5s.

On Admob site for banner sizes, there is no supported width size 375 or 415. Even if I add Admobs Smartbanner code, it still doesnt have the 375, 415 sizes for the iPhone6, 6 width. Same thing goes for iAd. What do i do then Can I just make the custom size I tested with test ads with these custom sizes and simulator and device work fine with them.

However, if I try  10.60.88.1088080nameofthemap.html I made up a name for the local IP the CORS parts of the map do not work properly, but everything else is fine.

Negative 982 pWhen I start the program with Windows XP style being on, then right click on desktop and on Display Properties window I click on Appearance tab, then switch from Windows XP style to Windows Classic style the background of the tabs has different color from rest of tab control.

Negative 982 pYesterday I was in class, and at some point the instructor was talking about C code. He said p  blockquote   pWhat is the purpose of making a pointer cast in C The only purpose   is to make the compiler interpret correctly the pointer operations   for example, adding an int pointer will result in a different offset   than adding a char pointer. Apart from that, there is no difference all pointers are represented the same way in memory, regardless if the pointer is pointing to an int value, a char value, a short value, or whatever. So, casting a pointer will not modify anything in the memory, it will just help the programmer with operations more related with the pointertype he is dealing with.p blockquote  pHowever, I have read, specially here in Stack Overflow, that this is not 100 true. I have read that in some weird machines, pointers for different types can be stored in different ways in memory. In this case, not changing the pointer to the correct type could cause problems if the code is compiled to this kind of machine.p  pBasically, this is the kind of code Im talking about. Consider the code belowp  precodeint intpointer char charpointer intpointer  mallocsizeofint intpointer  4 codepre  pAnd now two optionsp  p1.p  precodecharpointer  char intpointer codepre  p2.p  precodecharpointer  intpointer codepre  pThe code on case 2 could became a problem Making the cast case 1 would eventually change the pointer format in memory if yes, could you give an example of machinep  pThanksp

I turned to MISRA 2012 Dir 4.6. It is concerned mostly about the width of primitive types like short, int, and long, their width, and how they are signed.p  pThe standard does not give any amplification, rational, exception, or example for bool.p  pbool is explicitly defined as Bool in stdbool.h in C99. So does this criteria really apply boolp  pI thought Bool was explicitly always the smallest standard unsigned integer type large enough to store the values 0 and 1 according to section 6.2.5 of C99. So we know bool is unsigned. Is it then just a matter of the fact that Bool is not fixed width and subject being promoted somehow thats the issue Because the rational would seem to contradict that notion.p  blockquote   pAdherence to this guideline does not guarantee portability because the size of the int type may determine whether or not an expression is subject to integer promotion.p blockquote  pHow does just putting codetypedef bool booltcode change anything  because I do nothing to indicate the width or the signdedness in doing so The width of boolt will just be platform dependent too. Is there a better way to redefine boolp  blockquote   pA type must not be defined with a specific length unless the implemented type is actually of that lengthp blockquote  pso codetypedef bool bool8tcode should be totally illegal.p  pIs Gimpel wrong in their interpretation of Directive 4.6 or are they spot onp

Negative 982 pDoes anyone have a tested function that implements the a hrefhttpen.wikipedia.orgwikiScryptAlgorithm relnofollowscrypt algorithma in TSQL  Ive searched here and the interwebs at large and to my amazement have not found a CREATE FUNCTION statement I can copy and paste.  p  pOthers doing this search, be warned, that Google will help you by thinking you are a moron and replacing scrypt with script on your first search, until you promise you are indeed looking for scrypt.  p  pI half expect the answer to this question to be a link to an existing article, but Ill be damned if I can find it.  The alternative would be writing code from scratch myself, and nobody does that anymore, rightp  pThanks in advance for assistance.  p

Negative 982 pAs a .net developer, new to android, Im trying to consume images from my codeasmx webservicecode. Images are saved in the db as codenvarcharcode bytearray, so my webservice returns a string that can be converted into bitmap.  This all works fine but I run into problems trying to get png images with transparent parts in it.  No matter what I try, the transparent parts are always white.  The problem is, there could be a couple of things Im doing wrong here... p  pThis is the way I write my png to db c it could be Im losing transparancy here alreadyp  precode    Image toAdd  Image.FromFileIAndoidh1graph.png      string imagestring   System.Convert.ToBase64StringimageToByteArraytoAdd codepre  pAnd this is the way I consume it on my android app p  precode    Bitmap bmp      androidHttpTransport.callSOAPACTION, envelope      SoapPrimitive resultsRequestSOAP  SoapPrimitive envelope.getResponse      String result  resultsRequestSOAP.toString      if result.equals                    byte[] bloc  Base64.decoderesult, Base64.DEFAULT                   bmp  BitmapFactory.decodeByteArraybloc, 0, bloc.length                   bmp.setHasAlphatrue                   ByteArrayOutputStream os  new ByteArrayOutputStream                   bmp.compressBitmap.CompressFormat.PNG,  100,  os                   byte[] bloc2  os.toByteArray                   Bitmap bPNGCompress   BitmapFactory.decodeByteArraybloc2, 0, bloc2.length                   viewModel.setThreeDbPNGCompress        codepre  pIve stripped the code so only the essential code is there. So, this works but it doesnt keep transparency. p  pIm guessing, its because the codeBitmapFactory.DecodeByteArraycode creates a bitmap without transparency, and so the rest of the conversion code wont create transparency. p  pIm struggling for days now, trying to find solutions but I dont seem to find it.  There must be a best practice for consuming png images from a webservice, serialized as string . p  pUsing png from the resources, works ok with transparency, so I know my png is transparent and my UI controls are ok. I know the coding is not state of the art but to avoid having to copy paste all kinds of methods, I replaced some code, that is normally in methods, to make it more readablep  pIm at the start of a project, experimenting with android, so If anyone has a completely different idea on how te get images into my app, be free to post ideas.p
Negative 982 pWe are getting through the long slog of updating our embercli application to its latest iteration. We fell very much behind.

Doing this however I would not have access to the registry within the instance initializer to register the returned object from my promise which I would then inject into my controller. I assume I am thinking about this all wrong, but I have not been able to wrap my head around it. Any suggestions how I should by updating thisp

This logon type has the additional expense of caching logon information for disconnected operations     therefore, it is inappropriate for some clientserver applications,     such as a mail server.

Negative 982 pwhile making the exe with pyc.py, it is just referencing the images as static folder reference.brActually i have designed gui using the iron python in visual studio. i have an image which has to be displayed in the first frame.

For problem 2 I only need to know how can I measure the length of each separate column in my 2D array. From what Ive been reading for the past hours, maybe I have to use jagged array, instead of 2D. Would it be easier to get each columns length then Defining every next jagged array array of each columnin the forloop would be trickier, but I think I can do it using string to hold my numbers and then using .Split to assign value to the array.p  pI hope I expressed myself clearly enough. If that is not the case, please inform me, so I can specify. Any suggestions and information for both problems are very welcome.p  pThanksp

Negative 982 pI have a codeUITableViewcode that scrolls vertically. In each cell, there is a codeUICollectionViewcode which scrolls horizontally. I would like to make it so that the user can scroll the table view vertically, even while a horizontal collection view is being scrolled horizontally.p  pHowever, when I drag horizontally in the collection views, vertical motion is not passed on to the scrollview. How can I get the touch events in the collection views to the scroll view superviewp  pIve seen a bunch similar questions, but none that seem to address this specific issue  most of them are concerned with getting scrolls from the superview to the subviews, and handle it in ways that arent applicable here, like setting properties such as codedelaysContentTouchescode. p

Negative 982 pI have a Foo resource that codehasmanycode Bars. Im using nested resources for a limited number of actions, but otherwise prefer to keep my routing for bars shallow. There are two ways to navigate to the edit view for the Bar object  either from the nested path that includes codefoocode, or from the shallower codebarcode path that isnt nested inside codefoocode. For example, a user might click the edit button from the page at codefoos[fooid]bar[barid]code or from codebars[barid]code. p  pIn the first case, I want the controller to redirect the user back to the parent foo page codefoos[fooid]code after the record is updated. In the second case, I want it to redirect to the index view for codebarscode codebarscode. I believe I need some sort of conditional in the codeeditcode action in the codebarscode controller that will tell Rails where to go after codeupdatecode executes.p  precode configroutes.rb resources foos do   resources bars, only [new, edit] end  resources bars   binrake routes foobars     POST   foosfooidbars.format          barscreate newfoobar  GET    foosfooidbarsnew.format      barsnew editfoobar GET    foosfooidbarsidedit.format barsedit         bars GET    bars.format                       barsindex              POST   bars.format                       barscreate      newbar GET    barsnew.format                   barsnew     editbar GET    barsidedit.format              barsedit          bar GET    barsid.format                   barsshow              PATCH  barsid.format                   barsupdate              PUT    barsid.format                   barsupdate              DELETE barsid.format                   barsdestroy codepre  pThe controller for codebarscodep  precode appcontrollersbarcontroller.rb def edit   bar  bar.findparams[id]   foo  bar.foo end  def update   bar  bar.findparams[id]   foo  bar.foo    respondto do format     if bar.updateattributesbarparams       format.html  redirectto foo, notice bar successfully updated      else       format.html  render action edit      end   end end codepre  pIm trying to change the coderedirectto foocode line in the codeupdatecode action so there is conditional logic that switches out codefoocode for codebarscode depending on where the codeeditcode action was initiated. Ive tried something like the following to test whether codeparams[foo]code is present when the codeeditcode action is called, setting an instance variable for the redirect.p  precodedef edit   if params[foo]     redirectpage  foo   else     redirectpage  bars   end   bar  bar.findparams[id]   foo  bar.foo end  def update    code omitted...       format.html  redirectto redirectpage, notice bar successfully updated     code omitted... end codepre  pThis doesnt work. Rails states codecannot redirect to nilcode. Ive also tried something using a test based on codeURIrequest.referer.pathcode in the codeeditcode action, without success.p  pIm still not entirely clear how the Rails magic happens in the controller. I believe the codeeditcode action is the proper place to define the conditional for the redirect or through a method called in the codeeditcode action, as thats where the controller will see the incoming request and know where it came from. But I cant quite figure out to capture that information, and pass it along to codeupdatecode. Appreciate any guidance.p

Negative 982 pI am a newbie to Xamarin, and I have searched SO and Google for this but I have not found the right query to get my answer.  In flex, I can create a module and it can have assets, code, etc, and in that module I can implement a class based on an interface in the main app, and load it after the main app is loaded.p  pIn a game that I have written I load my levels this way.  It works great because the core app is totally independent and rarely requires updates.p  pBasically imagine that the main app has an IGameEngine interface for any interaction with it, and each level that is loaded from the cloud and cached locally like Angry Birds Seasons does with levels, will have an implementation of that IGameEngine which may or may not be the same or different from other levels, depending on the features needed in that level.p  pI will be using xamarin because I am comfortable with C and have a need to target all platforms, and thus need to minimize the code to do so.  I will most likely also be using CocosSharp as it seems to be an active community.p  pIn Xamarin can I do something similar  How  When I search for Xamarin modules, I get a million results for how to include a module in the compiler, obviously Im searching for the wrong keywords.p  pSorry for a question that an experienced user could probably locate in 5 seconds on Google, but I dont know where to start.

Negative 982 pWhile I used to be really an agile guy, after several years I can see that most agile projects failed because the upfront technicalarchitecture design and regression testing just cannot be skipped.br Many companies use the approach that could be described as mixing waterfall and agile  they do initial requirement analysis, create an outline of the technical solutiondesign and then develop the product iteratively, continously refining the backlog and all required components. Before each release, they do the hardening sprint e.g. in IBM. In other words, they add two phases from the waterfall while still using the best of agile.br I can honestly say I have never seen a large, complex project developed in agile that succeeded without upfront technical analysis and several hardening sprints. Yet there are many who claim that agile beats waterfall in everything. So I wonder, why agile is so often supplemented by waterfalllike modificationsp

Negative 982 pIm hoping this is the correct place to ask this, but after recently experiencing some strange behaviour I realised after doing a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions13934710howcanidetachtheobjectreferenceonmemorycachesome researcha that when using .NET memory cache and you retrieve an object from cache you retrieve a reference to that object in cache, rather than a copy of the object, so any updates to the object will persist in cache. p  pIn the example below the student is updated in the codeStudentControllercode, and retrieved again the codeCourseControllercode, with the student containing the updated value without having to refresh the cache.p  pMy initial approach was to clear the cached students collection after updating the DB because I thought the cached version wouldnt have included the update, but given that this persistence exists is there a need to repopulate the cache again once the database has been updated p  precode     Student controller     public class StudentController  Controller               omitted for brevity.          public ActionResult UpdateStudentint id                                                     var student  CollegeCache.Students[id]              student.FirstName  SpongeBob              studentRepository.updatestudent                  CollegeCache.clearStudents                             Course controller     public class CourseController  Controller               omitted for brevity.          public ActionResult GetCoursesDetailsint id                                                     var student  CollegeCache.Students[id]               here student.FirstName will be SpongeBob, and not its original value.

Negative 982 pEverything Ive found so far regarding timers is that its, at best, available at a 1ms resolution. QTimers docs claim thats the best it can provide.p  pI understand that OSes like Windows are not realtime OSes, but I still want to ask this question in hopes that someone knows something that could help.p  pSo, Im writing an app that requires a function to be called at a fairly precise but arbitrary interval, say 60 timessec full range 5961Hz. That means I need it to be called, on average, every 16.67ms. This part of the design cant change.p  pThe best timing source I currently have is vsync. When I go off of that, its pretty good. Its not ideal, because the monitors frequency is not exactly what I need to call this function at, but it can be somewhat compensated for.p  pThe kicker is that the level of accuracy given the range Im after is more or less available with timers, but not the level of precision I want. I can get a 16ms timer to hit exactly 16ms 97 of the time. I can get a 17ms timer to hit exactly 17ms 97 of the time. But no API exists to get me 16.67p  pIs what Im looking for simply not possiblep  pBackground The project is called a hrefhttpphoenix.vg relnofollowPhoenixa. Essentially, its a a hrefhttpwww.libretro.com relnofollowlibretroa frontend. Libretro cores are game console emulators encapsulated in individual shared libraries. The API function being called at a specific rate is coderetroruncode. Each call emulates a game frame and calls callbacks for audio, video and so on. In order to emulate at a consoles native framerate, we must call retrorun at exactly or as close to this rate, hence the timer.p

Whats throwing me off is that I was of the impression that rlen should now contain the length of the string Im using, but when I type the followingp  precodemov     byte[esi  rlen], 92             add a zero codepre  pI get a segfault. Same, also, if I use [buf  rlen]. Neither buf nor ESI on their own cause a segfault, so it seems to me that rlen isnt doing what I think it is.p  pAnyone able to help me figure out whats going onp
