So I used following code. p  precodepublic static void decodeFileString inputFileName,         String outputFileName         throws FileNotFoundException, IOException       Base64.Decoder decoder  Base64.getDecoder     InputStream in  new FileInputStreaminputFileName     OutputStream out  new FileOutputStreamoutputFileName      byte[] inBuff  new byte[BUFFSIZE]  final int BUFFSIZE  1024     byte[] outBuff  null     while in.readinBuff gt 0          outBuff  decoder.decodeinBuff         out.writeoutBuff          out.flush     out.close     in.close  codepre  pHowever, it always throws p  precodeException in thread AWTEventQueue0 java.lang.IllegalArgumentException Input byte array has wrong 4byte ending unit     at java.util.Base64Decoder.decode0Base64.java704     at java.util.Base64Decoder.decodeBase64.java526     at Base64Coder.JavaBase64FileCoder.decodeFileJavaBase64FileCoder.java69     ... codepre  pAfter I changed codefinal int BUFFSIZE  1024code into codefinal int BUFFSIZE  31024code, the code worked. Since BUFFSIZE is also used to encode file, I believe there were something wrong with the file encoded 1024  3  1, which means paddings are added in the middle of the file. p  pAlso, as Jon Skeet and Tagir Valeev mentioned, I should not ignore the return value from codeInputStream.readcode. So, I modified the code as below.p  pHowever, I have to mention that the code does run much faster than using codewrapcode. I noticed the speed difference because I had coded and intensively used Base64.encodeFiledecodeFile long before jdk8 was released. Now, my buffed jdk8 code runs as fast as my original code. So, I do not know what is going on with codewrapcode... p  precodepublic static void decodeFileString inputFileName,         String outputFileName         throws FileNotFoundException, IOException       Base64.Decoder decoder  Base64.getDecoder     InputStream in  new FileInputStreaminputFileName     OutputStream out  new FileOutputStreamoutputFileName      byte[] inBuff  new byte[BUFFSIZE]     byte[] outBuff  null     int bytesRead  0     while true              bytesRead  in.readinBuff         if bytesRead  BUFFSIZE                      outBuff  decoder.decodeinBuff                  else if bytesRead gt 0                      byte[] tempBuff  new byte[bytesRead]             System.arraycopyinBuff, 0, tempBuff, 0, bytesRead             outBuff  decoder.decodetempBuff                  else                      out.flush             out.close             in.close             return                  out.writeoutBuff       codepre  pSpecial thanks to Jon Skeet and Tagir Valeev.p

Numerically the data is identical and consistent regardless of what I put in at least when I write at least these three data types. The only significant difference is the lack of an unsigned type in Java and perhaps there is a binary representation difference which is where I was initially trying to resolve but I do not seem to be able to figure it out. p  pAs I have said. Using another format is not an option. I need the binary data written from java and then base 64 encoded to result in the same results as .NET. Serialization choices are not an option. This has to be it. I need a resource that will aid in bringing this together whether that means binary manipulation of byte data or not. I need some explanation in the datatypes and as I have searched significantly and not found a resource explaining how to do this or what the real differences are so I can implement a solution I decided to ask here.p

Positive 1011 pI need help converting a VERY LARGE binary file ZIP file to a Base64String and back again. The files are too large to be loaded into memory all at once they throw OutOfMemoryExceptions otherwise this would be a simple task. I do not want to process the contents of the ZIP file individually, I want to process the entire ZIP file.p  pThe problemp  pI can convert the entire ZIP file test sizes vary from 1 MB to 800 MB at present to Base64String, but when I convert it back, it is corrupted. The new ZIP file is the correct size, it is recognized as a ZIP file by Windows and WinRAR7Zip, etc., and I can even look inside the ZIP file and see the contents with the correct sizesproperties, but when I attempt to extract from the ZIP file, I get Error 0x80004005 which is a general error code. p  pI am not sure where or why the corruption is happening. I have done some investigating, and I have noticed the following p  pIf you have a large text file, you can convert it to Base64String incrementally without issue. If calling codeConvert.ToBase64Stringcode on the entire file yielded strongabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxstrong, then calling it on the file in two pieces would yield strongabcdefghijklstrong and strongmnopqrstuvwxstrong.p  pUnfortunately, if the file is a binary then the result is different. While the entire file might yield strongabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxstrong, trying to process this in two pieces would yield something like strongoiweh87yakgbstrong and strongkyckshfguywpstrong.p  pIs there a way to incrementally base 64 encode a binary file while avoiding this corruption p  pMy codep  precode        private void ConvertLargeFile                     FileStream inputStream   new FileStreamCUserstestDesktopmy.zip, FileMode.Open, FileAccess.Read            byte[] buffer  new byte[MultipleOfThree]            int bytesRead  inputStream.Readbuffer, 0, buffer.Length            whilebytesRead gt 0                           byte[] secondaryBuffer  new byte[buffer.Length]               int secondaryBufferBytesRead  bytesRead               Array.Copybuffer, secondaryBuffer, buffer.Length               bool isFinalChunk  false               Array.Clearbuffer, 0, buffer.Length               bytesRead  inputStream.Readbuffer, 0, buffer.Length               ifbytesRead  0                                 isFinalChunk  true                  buffer  new byte[secondaryBufferBytesRead]                  Array.CopysecondaryBuffer, buffer, buffer.length                               String base64String  Convert.ToBase64StringisFinalChunk  buffer  secondaryBuffer               File.AppendAllTextCUserstestDesktopBase64Zip, base64String                           inputStream.Dispose          codepre  pThe decoding is more of the same. I use the size of the codebase64Stringcode variable above which varies depending on the original buffer size that I test with, as the buffer size for decoding. Then, instead of codeConvert.ToBase64Stringcode, I call codeConvert.FromBase64Stringcode and write to a different file namepath.  p  pEDITp  pIn my haste to reduce the code I refactored it into a new project, separate from other processing to eliminate code that isnt central to the issue I introduced a bug. The base 64 conversion should be performed on the codesecondaryBuffercode for all iterations save the last Identified by codeisFinalChunkcode, when codebuffercode should be used. I have corrected the code above. p  pEDIT 2p  pThank you all for your commentsfeedback. After correcting the bug see the above edit, I retested my code, and it is actually working now. I intend to test and implement renes solution as it appears to be the best, but I thought that I should let everyone know of my discovery as well.p

Positive 1011 pOk, so Im out of my depths with this one. p  pI am building a website for my mother who is starting up a very smallscale business offering child meditation lessons. Once parents apply their children via the online form I want them to receive a nice looking email, that has some basic imagery e.g. company logo. p  pI got the websites HTMLformPHP combo to work properly. This means I am able to get the PHP to send a plain text email message upon people submitting the form. p  pWhen I changed the body in the PHP file from plain text into a free HTMLemailtemplate I found online the email stopped from popping up in my Gmail. First, the PHPsyntax was wrong, but I managed to fix that. I then tried to send a simple HTML email via PHP and it was indeed received successfully by Gmail. However when I tried the entire template again, it stopped working.. After a lot of trialanderror I discovered that Gmail stopped receiving the email as soon as I included an lt IMG tag into the HTML code in the PHP file.p  pOver a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions6706891embeddingimageinhtmlemailherea I learned that a picture can also be embedded inline via base64 coding. So, I adapted my HTML code so that the all the lt IMG tags had a markup similar to this onep  pdiv classsnippet datalangjs datahidefalse div classsnippetcode pre classsnippetcodehtml langhtml prettyprintoverridecodeltimg srcdataimagejpgbase64,base64datastring here gtcodepre div div p  pNow, the email does indeed show up in Gmail again. However, all my images are shown as plaintext base64 codestrings. p  pI have also read at multiple places that this problem might be tackled by adding your images as attachments and by using a contentID. Ive found numerous ways of doing this, and I have tried many of them, but all examples Ive found so far seem incomplete and I am apparently lacking the knowledge to see the bigger picture funny metaphor. So I havent got any of them to work.p  pWhat I have not yet managed to find as well is a simple PHPmailtemplate of an HTML email, containing an image, and that is proven to work with Gmail as well.

Positive 1011 pI am using Grgoires PHP a hrefhttpsgithub.comGregwarCaptcha relnofollowCaptcha librarya, on local host, it is working fine, as of creating images, and sending to browser. But when same code is on remote server, Captcha Image is not being displayed client side. Since in both cases each image request is responded with around 20kB of data, I am sure the image is being downloaded. And from the looks of it, it seems a valid base64 of an image. the only difference I have noticed is that when logging the base64 string, it is usually shorter, around 8kB, while the base64 from localhost is just as much as the real image, 20kB. But with my knowledge, I dont know how to use this information.

So maybe this method does not work on remote config, because of the connection delay and what I did is that I replaced the src tag with an ajax request that WAITS for the success and then loads the base64data. If anybody could give a confident comment on this suspicion, hopefully we get to the answer..p

Negative 1011 pTen years ago when I first encountered the a hrefhttpen.wikipedia.orgwikiCapabilityMaturityModel relnofollowCMM for softwarea I was, I suppose like many, struck by how accurately it seemed to describe the chaotic level one state of software development in many businesses, particularly with its reference to reliance on heroes.  It also seemed to provide realistic guidance for an organisation to progress up the levels improving their processes.p  pBut while it seemed to provide a good model and realistic guidance for improvement, I  never really witnessed an adherence to CMM having a significant positive impact on any organisation I have worked for, or with.  I know of one large software consultancy that claims CMM level 5  the highest level  when I can see first hand that their processes are as chaotic, and the quality of their software products as varied, as other, nonCMM businesses.p  pSo Im wondering, has anyone seen a real, tangible benefit from adherence to process improvement according to CMMp  pAnd if you have seen improvement, do you think that the improvement was specifically attributable to CMM, or would an alternative approach such as a hrefhttpen.wikipedia.orgwikiSixSigma relnofollowsixsigmaa have been equally or more beneficialp  pDoes anyone still believep  pAs an aside, for those who havent yet seen it, check out this funnybecauseitstrue a hrefhttpen.wikipedia.orgwikiCapabilityImmaturityModel relnofollowparodyap
Negative 1011 pIve kind of backed myself into a corner here.p  pI have a series of UserControls that inherit from a parent, which contains a couple of methods and events to simplify things so I dont have to write lines and lines of nearidentical code. As you do. The parent contains no other controls.p  pWhat I want to do is just have one event handler, in the parent UserControl, which goes and does stuff that only the parent control can do that is, conditionally calling an event, as the events defined in the parent. Id then hook up this event handler to all my input boxes in my child controls, and the child controls would sort out the task of parsing the input and telling the parent control whether to throw that event. Nice and clean, no repetitive, copypaste code which for me emalwaysem results in a bug.p  pHeres my question. Visual Studio thinks Im being too clever by half, and warns me that the method CheckReadiness [the event handler in the parent] cannot be the method for an event because a class this class derives from already defines the method. Yes, Visual Studio, emthats the pointem. I emwantem to have an event handler that only handles events thrown by child classes, and its only job is to enable me to hook up the children without having to write a single line of code. I dont need those extra handlers  all the functionality I need is naturally called as the children process the user input.p  pIm not sure why Visual Studio has started complaining about this now as it let me do it before, and Im not sure how to make it go away. Preferably, Id like to do it without having to define a method that just calls CheckReadiness. Whats causing this warning, whats causing it to come up now when it didnt an hour ago, and how can I make it go away without resorting to making little handlers in all the child classesp

Negative 1011 pI am making extensive use of codeboostsharedptrcode in my code. In fact, most of the objects that are allocated on the heap are held by a codesharedptrcode.

Consider this codep  precodevoid barboostsharedptrltFoogt pFoo      ...   void FoosomeFunction      barthis  codepre  pThere are two problems here.  First, this wont compile because the T constructor for codesharedptrcode is explicit.

Negative 1011 pOur company recently began creating CVS branches to mark each release.  Formerly we had been using tags, and if we fixed something during the testing period that needed to go out with the release, we simply moved the tag forward.  This works well until two changes are made to the same file one that should be released and the other that shouldnt.  Now we need to apply the same change to both the head and the release branch.p  pIm using Eclipses CVS plugin to interact with CVS.  When I look at a files history, I see a i20090529Release tag in the Tags section in this case on revision 1.30 of the file, and when I Show Tag Viewer within the History view, the icon indicates that this is a Branch tag, as opposed to a Version tag.  When I look at revisions that have been committed since the Branch occurs I see that the next revision made to the head becomes version 1.31, and the next revision made to the branch becomes version 1.30.2.1.  My question is, why does the i20090529Release tag stay with version 1.30 of the file, which is not the most recent revision on the i20090529 branch  Is this really even a bonafide tag, or is it more of a conceptual idea that the branch began branching off at this point  I notice I cant apply this tag to any other revision of the file.  Why does it appear in the Tags column at allp  pThanks in advance for any clarification you can provide.p

Negative 1011 pWe have a weekly maintenance plan to shrink all user databases and rebuild their indexes.  This has working fine until we created a readonly database, now each time the plan runs it fails when it starts processing this database due to its read only state.p  pAs far as I can see we have two options remove the read only flag from the database, this is possible but as the database is only updated once a quarter it makes sense from a performance point of view to make use of the readonly feature.  Or manually select the database that the plan should run for i.e. all the users databases apart from the read only one, this then requires people to remember to add any new databases into the plan.p  pDoes anyone have any suggestions of a better way of doing thisp  pThanksp  pNeilp
Negative 1011 pIs it possible to use the CONTAINSTABLE and NOT keywords with SQL Server fulltext searching and exclude rows where a single column contains the value to be excludedp  pFor example, lets take the following indexed view simplified for the purposes of illustrating this problemp  precodeItemId INT FirstName VARCHAR200 MiddleName VARCHAR200 LastName VARCHAR200 Address VARCHAR1000 ChildrenNames TEXT SearchData TEXT codepre  pSearchData is a concatenated field generated from the other textvarchar fields.p  pThis view can then be searched using the following query to find rows that contain emfirstnameem but not emlastnameemp  precodeSELECT   FROM    [vMyView] V         LEFT OUTER JOIN CONTAINSTABLE                    [vMyView],                       [FirstName],            [MiddleName],            [LastName],            [Address],            [ChildrenName],            [SearchData]          , name AND NOT lastname FTS ON [FTS].[Key]  [V].[ItemId]  WHERE   ISNULLRANK,0 gt 0 codepre  pThis query doesnt seem to return the correct results, as it will only exclude rows if strongALLstrong of the fields being searched meet the criteria, whereas it should exclude strongANYstrong rows that meet the criteria.p  pie. Rows that contain emnameem AND emlastnameem in stronganystrong single column should be excluded from the result set, rather than only rows that contain emnameem and emlastnameem in strongeverystrong column which is going to be unlikely.p  pThe only option available seems to be to check if the user query contains any exclude values eg. name lastname, and if so, restrict the query to searching the SearchData column only as this is a concatenated column and will contain all data.  However, this will affect the relevancy ranking and doesnt seem like a good solution.p

Negative 1011 pIm working on an application that needs to accept posted data from a form and process it. One step of this process is to unescape the data that comes in.

Negative 1011 pI am calculating a large number of possible resulting combinations of an algortihm. To sort this combinations I rate them with a double value und store them in PriorityQueue. Currently, there are about 200k items in that  queue which is pretty much memory intesive. Acutally, I only need lets say the best 1000 or 100 of all items in the list. So I just started to ask myself if there is a way to have a priority queue with a fixed size in Java. I should behave like this Is the item better than one of the allready stored If yes, insert it to the according position and throw the element with the least rating away.p  pDoes anyone have an idea Thanks very much againp  pMarcop

Negative 1011 pI have a file open on the iPhone that I am sending the data of across the network Opened using open.  However I have the ability to delete files from the iphones interface.  This is done using NSFileManagers removeItemAtPath.p  pThe odd thing is that removeItemAtPath is succeeding even though the file is currently open.  p  pThe file transfers perfectly across the network and removeItemAtPath succeeds before the transfer is complete.  So does removeItemAtPath do a lazy delete ie does it queue it for later if the file is in use  If so then no problems.p  pIf not ... does anyone know how I can get NSFileManager to actually report the fact that it didnt do the deletep  pThanksp

Negative 1011 pOkay, I am stumped on this one and need some quick help.p  pI have an ASP.NET application using Forms authentication.  In my Login.aspx page, I use several images in the background for visual affect.  The urls are being set using CSS styles that are defined in the file not in a theme et al.  All of the images are located in an Images folder under the root level of the website.  There is a separate web.config in the Images folder allowing all users access.p  pThe issue Im running into is getting the images to resolve consistently in the development environment and production environment.  What I learned and have no control over is that the site is deployed to a subsite in production while we are using the Cassini web server in Visual Studio for development.  As a result, starting each path with a backslash  doesnt work in production although it works fine in development. Removing the backslash breaks the dev environment.p  pCurrently, I have the CSS defined similar top  precodebanner      background transparent urlImagesplainBlueHeader2.png norepeat 20 0     height 70px     top 21px     left 3px  codepre  pThis doesnt work in Development but it works in our QA and Production environments.p  pTo make matters worse, this was apparently working fine and less knowledgable coworkers are blaming some recent additions to the application where we added several new pages in a subfolder.

Negative 1011 pIm writing a ruby app that stores ancestry type data. I.e. Family tree.p  pFor the rest of the application Im using MongoDB for storage as it lends itself to a hierarchical structure, however ancestry data doesnt quite fit that model, even though it is hierarchical in a sense. Im curious if anyone has a suggestion on whether I should be swapping in a more appropriate database layer to handle thesep  pI.e. A is paired with B bidirectional and has parents C and D. B has parents E and F. A and B have children G, H, I. G is paired with H, and so on.p  pSo its not quite recursive since one node has 2 parent nodes. Therefore embedding doesnt make sense in MongoDB since both parents would embed the same tree in duplicate. Its closer to a social graph only more rigid theres only 2 types of relationships. Im thinking Redis sets would work very well, but before I go complicating the stack with Polyglot persistence, I was hoping I could get some feedback from others who may have designed similar structures. The other concern I have with Redis is storing all of these trees in memory might not be a great idea, although if I was only storing the relationships in Redis with the object data in MongoDB documents it would probably be ok.p

Negative 1011 pNot that it matters, but this is a followup to a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comq4773694445210this questiona. p  pI want to keep a count of how many times each object in my database has been viewed. Lets say we have a codePersoncode model, with several instances. We want to keep a counter of how many times each instance has been viewed in the codePersoncode model, using Django Celery to avoid waiting for the database writes.p  pAt the moment Im doing thisp  precodefrom celery.decorators import task  class Personmodels.Model     name  models.CharFieldmaxlength50   class Statsmodels.Model     person  models.ForeignKeyPerson, uniqueTrue     task     def addViewself         se  StatEvent         se.save         self.views.addse  class StatEventmodels.Model     date  models.DateTimeFieldautonowaddTrue codepre  pThen, every time the view is called which lists a page of persons, I get all persons, update the statistics like thisp  precodeperson.getstats.addView.delayperson.getstats codepre  pwhere after I then return the list of persons to be displayed in the browser. I thought that the updating of the statistics would happen asynchronously, but theres a clear and long delay before the page is displayed, which is confirmed by having a codeprintcode statement shown for each addition in the Celery command window. The page is only rendered once the last statistic has been updated.p  pHow do I ensure that the user doesnt wait for the database update to finishp  pstrongUpdatestrongp  pI thought it might have something to do with there not being enough worker processes to process each person separately, so I instead made a function that accepts a list of persons as parameter, and used this as the task to be executed. So, only one task in the queuep  precodetaskignoreresultTrue def addViewspersons     for person in persons         stats  listing.getstats         se  StatEvent         se.save         stats.views.addse codepre  pHowever, when print to the console, like thisp  precode    print adding     print tasks.addClickspersons     print done codepre  pThen theres a clear delay between the adding and done step, and the returned value of the function is codeNonecode. p

Negative 1011 pA user can perform an action, which may trigger dependent actions which themselves may have dependent actions and I want to be able to cancel the whole thing if the user cancels a dependent action.p  pThe typical way Ive seen this done is some variant of an undo stack and each action will need to know how to undo itself, and then if a child action is cancelled the undos cascade their way up.  Sometimes writing undo methods are tricky and there isnt always enough information in context to properly know how to undo an action in an isolated manner.p  pI just thought of a potentially easier way which is to just codepicklecode the state of the relevant parts of program, and then the cancel would just restore to its former state, without needing to create separate undo logic for each action.p  pHas anyone tried this  Any gotchas to watch out for  Any reason not to do thisp  pEdit The dependent actions must happen after the parent action and even whether there are dependent actions may depend on the result of the parent action, so just checking all the dependencies before doing anything isnt an option.  I guess you could say an action triggers other actions, but if one of the triggered actions cannot be performed, then none of it happened.p

Negative 1011 pI have a model that gets treated differently by a parameter it holds, for example its like a character table, which also is used for non player characters, since they share all the same attributes. So it would have a Boolean or integer that would indicate if it was a player character or a nonplayer character. And nonplayer characters will be generated automatically with random status parameters and names.p  pSince the methods used for the two are radically different, I though it would be logical to have a different controller class for them, but that would make a single model have two different controllers, and feels somewhat odd.p  pIs this bad practice Should I do all the coding in one controllerp

Negative 1011 pThis situation is pretty difficult to explain, but Ill do my best.p  pFor school, we have to create a web application written in PHP which allows teachers to manage their students projects and allow these to make peerevaluation.

So this table contains a userid and a groupid to link these.p  pAt last, admins can decide when users need to do their peerevaluation and how much time they have for it. So there is a last table strongevaluationsstrong containing an evaluationid, a start and end date and a projectid the actual evaluations are stored in a sixth table, which is not relevant for now.p  pI think this is a good design, but it gets harder when I actually have to use this data. I would like to show a list of evaluations you still have to fill in. The only thing you know is your userid as this is stored in the session.p  pSo this would have to be donebr 1 Run a query on groupmembers to see in which groups the user is.br 2 With this result, run a query on groups to see to which projects these groups are related.br 3 Now that we know what projects the user is in, the evaluations table should be queried to see if there are ongoing evaluations for this projects.br 4 We now know which evaluations are available, but now we also need to check the sixth table to see if the user has already completed this evaluation.p  pAll these steps are dependent on the result of each other, so they should all contain their own error handling. Once the user has chosen the evaluation they wish to fill in a evaluationID will be send via GET, a lot of new queries will have to be run to check which users this member has in his group and will have to evaluate and another check to see which other groupmembers are already evaluated.p  pAs you see, this is quite complex. With all the errorhandling included, my script will be a real mess. Someone told me a view might help in this situation, but I dont really understand why this would help me here.p  pIs there a good way to do thisp  pThank you very muchp

Negative 1011 pIs it possible to use multithreading in a .NET COM callable wrapper DLL assemblyp  pFor example, I have a .NET assembly dll that exposes a .NET FTP library to COM. Upload functions are currently programmed as best effort functions. Im not using events or return values to show whether an upload or download completed successfully, which is something I may consider implementing later if necessary. Could the .NET assembly in my really limited understanding simply farm out these upload and download processes to another thread Assuming this is possible, what would be the result of this if the hosting application was closed before the uploads or downloads were all completedp
Negative 1011 pIm trying to develop a scrollable tile map in strongCocos2Dstrong which uses an codeUIPanGestureRecognizercode to do the dirty work, but while developing it, stumbled upon some problems for which I would like to ask for an advice.p  pThe basic scrolling management works fine, its precise and accurate and works by adding the translation recognized by the pan gesture manager to the tiles of the map. The problem is that the map is large and I just draw a small viewport of it, while I want to manage it like its scrollable without any problem.p  pWhat I was thinking about is that, as soon as a whole row or column get out of the visible screen, it is moved to the opposite side, the corresponding texture rects are updated Im working entirely with a codeCCSpriteBatchNodecode, so that it will continuously update the viewport to make the whole thing work. This seems fine but Ive found many problems in dealing with when to move the rowcolumn, how to keep track of this issue eg when pan changes direction from forth to back and many little details which make me think that I should find a better approach.p  pIs there a common solution to my problem That is managing a scrollable viewport of a tilemap which should move over the whole map so the to the end user it seems like as if the map is infinite.p  pThanks in advancep

However, the usual pastebins are not allowing things like tagging inputs, keeping track of history, authorization and so on. The more complex ones are not open source, and I cant host them myself thats quite the necessity, because sometimes Id like to cover some more sensitive data.

Negative 1011 pIm planning on building a Java server that will handle real time game communications between clients. What is the best type of Java implementation out there that could efficiently and, hopefully, accurately communicate between a client and server at high speeds say 515 packets per second I know there are many types of Java networking APIs ie. ObjectInputStream and ObjectOutputStream, DatagramPacket, KyroNet, etc., but Im not sure what is the most effective andor commonly used implementation for such a scenario. I would assume that most real time games use UDP communication methods, but I understand the reliability issues that come with it. Are there UDP implementations that have some form of flow control Anyway, thanks in advancep

Negative 1011 pI know that when you call codefwritecode or codefprintfcode or rather any other function that writes to a file, the contents arent immediately flushed to the disk, but buffered in the memory. p  pFirstly, where do the OS manage these buffers and how. Secondly, if you do the write to a file and later read in the content you wrote and assuming that the OS didnt flushed the contents between the time you wrote and read, how it knows that it has to return the read from the buffer How does it handle this situation.  p  pThe reason I want to know this is that Im interested in implementing my own buffering scheme in userspace, rather than kernel space as done by OS. That is, write to a file would be buffered in userspace and the actual write will only occur at a certain point. Consquently I also need to handle situations where read is called for the content that is still in the buffer. Is it possible to do all this in userspace.  p

Negative 1011 pI have a set of edges from a graph, and would like to expand it with all edges that share a vertex with any edge. How could I do this efficiently with codeboostgraphcodes p  pThe only way Ive been able to come up with is the naive solution of extracting all the source and target vertices, using codeboostadjacentverticescode to get all adjacencies and then creating all the new edges with codeboostedgecode. Is there a better way of doing this p  pstrongContextstrong The graph vertices are centroids of a terrain triangulation, the edges connect vertices whose corresponding triangles are adjacent so sort of a dual graph. The set of edges Im looking to expand corresponds to intertriangle paths which are blocked, and the blocked area is expanding. The area is sortof circular, so most of the edges Ill see using my naive approach above will already be part of the set.p

Negative 1011 pIm trying to implement a naive Bayes classifier to classify documents that are essentially emsetsem as opposed to bags of features, i.e. each feature contains a set of unique features, each of which can appear at most once in the document. For example, you can think of the features as unique keywords for documents.p  pIve closely followed the Rennie, et. al. paper at a hrefhttpwww.aaai.orgPapersICML2003ICML03081.pdf relnofollowhttpwww.aaai.orgPapersICML2003ICML03081.pdfa, but I am running into a problem that doesnt seem to be addressed. Namely, classifying short documents are resulting in much higher posterior probabilities due to the documents having a smaller number of features vice versa for long documents.p  pThis is because the posterior probabilities are defined as ignoring the denominatorp  precodePclassdocument  Pclass  Pdocumentclass codepre  pwhich expands top  precodePclassdocument  Pclass  Pfeature1class  ...  PfeatureKclass codepre  pFrom that, its clear that short documents with fewer features will have higher posterior probabilities simply because there are fewer terms to multiply together.p  pFor example, suppose the features foo, bar, and baz all show up in positive training observations. Then, a document with single feature foo will have a higher posterior probability of being classified in the positive class than a document with features foo, bar, baz. This seems counterintuitive, but Im not quite sure how to solve this.p  pIs there some sort of length normalization that can be done One idea is to add the size of the document as a feature, but that doesnt seem quite right since results would then be skewed by the size of documents in the training data.p

For some reason no matter how i send this data to magento, magento will create the invoice with the amount as seen on the order but it dosent add any of the products to the invoice page. Its like its completely ignoring the itemQtys array.

Negative 1011 pIm trying to use the LuaXml module in my world of warcraft addon.  Every time I test the addon I get an error that I am calling a nil value with require.  I suspect that this is because the thing I am requiring has not loaded correctly.  From looking at the LuaXml.lua file it seems that it requires LuaXMLlib.dll.  However, I am unsure how to get this to load into the addon.  I have all of the files in the proper addon folder and in my .toc file and I believe they are in the correct order.  p  pI suspect that I need to do something with LuaBinaries.  I put the folder Microsoft.VC80.CRT in the addon folder and put msvcr80.dll in that folder.  I feel like I need a .lib file to link this to my lua files but Im not sure.p  pAfter doing all this I feel lost.  Any advicenext stepscorrections would be appreciatedp

Negative 1011 pSuppose you have a .Net solution with a main project that uses various components. Now, two of these components reference a certain common library CommLib.

Negative 1011 pThank you for taking the time to read this. I am attempting to write some code to connect to a Lantronix UDS10 SerialNetwork interface. My applet runs, but it wont repaint. If you could give me any pointers, Id appreciate it. Believe it or not, I actually went to school for this Bachelors Degree in Computer Science. However, that was two years ago, and I pretty much havent touched it since. Im pretty good when it comes to the basics classes, methods, variables, etc., but Im afraid Im a bit lacking on the graphics and threading  multithreading. A lot of the code came from the Lantronix manual available here a hrefhttpwww.endurancerc.commediaCreatingCustomWebPages.pdf relnofollowhttpwww.endurancerc.commediaCreatingCustomWebPages.pdfa.p  pThe code requires a string of 5 chunks of characters, each separated by a space, sent by a ServerSocket over port 10001.p  pEDIT The server updates the string regularly. If a window is moved over my applet, the part of the applet underneath the window will repaint. However, I cant seem to find the way to trigger it whenever the characters change.

Negative 1011 pI have an app that uses core data. The app is free for download and offers some options to buy. The inapp purchase options are based in the number of uses of a given function. The idea is to sell something like 1 for 10 uses, 10 for 100 uses, etc.p  pBut, I want to give the user one or two uses for free. My question is this when the user first uses that function, I would mark it as used on core data, so, the next time, the user will have to buy more uses from the store, but suppose the user removes the app from the device after using it for the first time and reinstalls it from the cloud. Now the database is done, so, the flag I have saved after the first use. Now the user can use it again for free and will never pay anything.p  pIs there an option to prevent the user from doing this I mean, saving the information on iCloud, for example yes, I know I can create my own server and force the users to register, but this is boring for the user... I am thinking about something inside iCloud or something.p  pAny thoughts thanks.p

Negative 1011 pOur unit tests extend something like ApplicationContextAwareBaseTest which during the past several years has bloated with lots and lots of mocks and an Spring ApplicationContext which is filled with these mocked DAOs and Services.p  pI understand that this has been a convenient way to do tests and not care about what exactly is always needed for the plumbing to get a new test running. But this also feels like a death march as most tests only use a small part of the provided stuff and tests are getting slower. Id like to refactor this to something healthier.p  pHow would you go about thisp  pBasically Im thinking about stripping the base class to a lot smaller version and then new base classes that extend this that have more specific stuff for certain area of tests.p  pBut is there some way to help this process. The code base is considerably large and Im left wondering if theres a suitable dependency analyzer for this task or if some scripting would help me in finding suitable subsets.p  pIm also thinking if the current baseclass could somehow make the mocking lazy. Like writing an aspect that fires when a mock is touched and only then initializes it. But this is problematic as the mocks get added to the ApplicationContext so the aspect would always be fired.p  pHow would you go about partitioning a big test set with the above described scenario Im guessing this is somewhat typical problem with big codebases. p

Negative 1011 pI have been having problem with the new update to subversion 1.7 vs the use of Jenkins. p  pHere is the deal, a few people in our company switch to the new subversion 1.7, therefore they cannot revert to the old 1.6 subversion folder structure unless they commit everything erase their folder, uninstall the new 1.7 subversion with all their cool new feature, install the old and boring 1.6 and reexport everything, I know. p  pSo considering the fact that want to move forward and use the new feature of subversion 1.7 such as having externals that can easily use revision number..., I now have a problem with jenkins. p  pThe option I have for Jenkins is to use the pluggins for SVNKIT 1.3.7 or can be update to 1.3.9. If we look at the download page for SVNKIT  a hrefhttpsvnkit.comdownload.php relnofollowhttpsvnkit.comdownload.phpa  they say that the version 1.3.7 and 1.3.9 is incompatible with Subversion 1.7. This should be fix around march 2012. My server have to be up and running asap so I cannot wait 1 whole month.p  pSo what would be your suggestion for me to try to have my user use Subversion 1.7 and that I could still be using Jenkins.p  pFYI I tried the following  p  ul liChanging the protocol used on the server, using protocol SSLv3 make Subversion work but fail jenkins, and using TLSv1 and SSLv3 make jenkins work but fail some subversion operation, so no positive result.li liChanging the protocol option in jenkins to use SSLv3, this was mention in a few faq that by default jenkins use protocol TLSv1, still no positive result. Always give me the error Unable to access codehttpssvn.myrepos.comsvnteamlibpackageThePackagestrunkcode  svn OPTIONS svnteamlibpackageThePackagestrunk failed show details Maybe you need to enter credentialli liMaking a new repository on another server that use TLSv1 and SSLv3, this repository would only contain an external link to the real basic repository  example the new repository codehttpssvn2.myrepos.comsvnteamlibtestpackagetrunkcode this only contain an external to the svn on the other server using only SSLv3 codehttpssvn.myrepos.comsvnteamlibpackageThePackagestrunkcode .li ul  pThe latest is the closest I have been to a success since Jenkins work fine to build everything but seem to be unable to export externals. I am able though to do the export manually but I would need that to be done by jenkins.p  pSo any thoughtp

Negative 1011 pI have built a website in django framework. It has a lot of features such as blog, discussion forum, basically there are lots of ways users can interact. I have built a basic notification framework where a user gets notified when somebody comments on their blog, or answers their question in the forum.p  pSince the notifications are stored in db, new notifications are displayed only when a page refresh is done. I would like to make it real time using some push server using something like long polling technique. p  pI have come across codeNowJScode which seems to be pretty handy for this, but in all the examples that are given I could not see any example where there was any interaction with the database. In all the cases there was some information sent by one client and it was displayed to one or more clients.p  pWhat I actually want to do is to call a function using NowJS, and make it go to sleep until a new notification is added in the database. When a new notifications comes in the server responds back with the notification and a new request is done immediately.p  pI can figure out all other parts except how to access the database from Node server that is used by NowJS. Any help or guidance is appreciated.p

The parameters rows, page, sidx and sord added by jqGrid in the url when asking for data are somehow stripped off by joomla and the values that i get in my script are always null.

Negative 1011 pAn often seen recommendation on best practices regarding codeMoosecode is the followingp  blockquote   pThe use codenamespaceautocleancode bit is simply good code hygiene, as it removes imported symbols from your classs namespace at the end of your packages compile cycle, including codeMoosecode keywords. Once the class has been built, these keywords are not needed. strongThis is preferred to placing codeno Moosecode at the end of your packagestrong.p blockquote  pTaken for a hrefhttpsearch.cpan.orgperldocMoose3a3aManual3a3aBestPracticesnamespace3a3aautocleanandimmutabilizeMooseManualBestPracticesa emphasis mine.p  pI understand everything regarding the quote above, except for one thing emwhyem is the use of codenamespaceautocleancode preferred to the use of codeno Moosecode at the end of the lexical scopep  pIs it just because codenamespaceautocleancode is more versatile, allowing for more options in its use, or is there something intrinsic to the way it was implemented specially tailored for codeMoosecode classes, perhaps that makes it more reliablep  pI found no documentation clarifying this, and I would much like to know the right answer.p

Negative 1011 pSpecifically, Im trying to find the image path. This would be a super useful thing to be able to get, and as far as Ive found nobody knows how. Ive looked at the generated nib file for keys, and Im able to see the image URL in there test.jpg but cant find the key to get it. The key UIImage returns the actual already constructed image constructed via codeinitWithCGImageStoredCGImageRefcgImage scaleCGFloatscale orientationUIImageOrientationorientationcode and a mysterious UIKit function call codeGetImageAtPathcode which calls the mentioned init call, so thats not helpful.p  pIve also tried writing the UIImageView to disk with a NSKeyedArchiver and none of those values seem correct either, nor does the test.jpg value exist there.p  pIf nobody can figure this out  anyone know how to read in a binary file as text I could just read through the nib and parse out URLs, which is better than nothing, but NSStrings constructors fail regardless of what format I try.p

Negative 1011 pI am having an issue with sockets where the data Im sending is getting truncated on the client side FlashFlex.  The data that is sent by my server is full and in tact, but flash does not wait the appropriate amount of time before firing an event saying to read the data.  This results in the data not getting fully read and as such I cant parse the object out of it after that.  We are exploring the possibility of stripping the object into smaller chunks, but the idea is for it to be as lightweight as possible so we would much rather get it to work the way its supposed to than patch in a temporary solution.p  pIm not entirely sure if referring to it as the receive buffer is correct, as some computers are able to receive all of the data and others are having it truncated which means the buffer is adequate but flash isnt waiting the appropriate amount of time to dispatch the event for whatever the reason...If anyone has any ideas I would greatly appreciate themp

Negative 1011 pLet me start off by giving you all a brief run down of our application Please dont be instantly turned off by my large post, its quite simple scenario, I was just descriptive  We have an ASP.NET web site, mostly C, which acts as a store front for all of the stores within our franchise.p  pEach store could be in a different timezone, but we need to indicate on our site if the store is open or closed.p  pThe server has a DB which hold rows that indicate different time schedule for different stores which could be presented with on our asp.net website.p  pIn my database, I have columns and rows which hold the Location offset, and store hours in UTC. Examplep  ul liLocationID 21 li liTimeZoneOffSet 500li liSundayOpen 1545li liSundayClose 1620li ul  pI have come up with a way to determine on the server if the location is open or not.  I am having a tough time determining if it will work with Daylight Savings Time.  My question is, does this account for Daylight Savings Time, and have I gone about this scenario correctly, as I have not dealth with Time like thisp  pHeres what I do in my server side codep  pHere is the important parts of my class that I use to hold store schedule from the DBp  precodepublic class TimeSchedule      public TimeSpan locationOffset  get set      public TimeSpan sundayOpen  get set      public TimeSpan sundayClose  get set       public TimeSchedule              locationOffset  new TimeSpan         sundayOpen  new TimeSpan         sundayClose  new TimeSpan         I have loaded a TimeSchedule object by id TimeSchedule schedule  location.getTimeScheduleByLocationID21   Get the UTC time DateTime utcNow  new DateTime utcNow  DateTime.UtcNow  Get the offset value that we stored in our schedule object TimeSpan locationOffSetHour  schedule.locationOffset  I then apply the location offset hour to the server utc time. DateTime locationTime  new DateTime locationTime  utcNow.AddlocationOffSetHour    Get the day of the week from our locationTime that we off setted from UTC  string LocationWeekDay  locationTime.DayOfWeek.ToString   Now for each case of week day, I check to see if the difference in time is gt 0  If so I assume the store is open     TimeSpan zeroDifference  new TimeSpan0, 0, 0       This switch case just gets the difference in time according to LocationTime that we offsetd from UTC and stored time for the location on the server.     Then verifies that the location is open for that day      switch LocationWeekDay                  case Sunday                Verify that location is open, turn on open sign               TimeSpan differenceOpenTimeSun  new TimeSpan               differenceOpenTimeSun  locationTime.TimeOfDay  schedule.sundayOpen            TimeSpan differenceCloseTimeSun  new TimeSpan           differenceCloseTimeSun  schedule.sundayClose  locationTime.TimeOfDay            if differenceOpenTimeSun gt zeroDifference ampamp differenceCloseTimeSun gt zeroDifference                             imgSign.ImageUrl  SiteImagesopen.jpg                          else                             imgSign.ImageUrl  SiteImagesclosed.jpg                          break  codepre  pThank you for taking the time to look at my solution Any Headsup or nonos would be greatly appreciated as well p

Negative 1011 pIm working on a Haskell project that involves tying a big knot Im parsing a serialized representation of a graph, where each node is at some offset into the file, and may reference another node by its offset. So I need to build up a map from offsets to nodes while parsing, which I can feed back to myself in a codedo reccode block.p  pI have this working, and kindasortareasonably abstracted into a codeStateTcodeesque monad transformerp  precode LANGUAGE DoRec, GeneralizedNewtypeDeriving   import qualified Control.Monad.State as S  data Knot s  Knot  past  s, future  s   newtype RecStateT s m a  RecStateT S.StateT Knot s m a deriving    Alternative   , Applicative   , Functor   , Monad   , MonadCont   , MonadError e   , MonadFix   , MonadIO   , MonadPlus   , MonadReader r   , MonadTrans   , MonadWriter w   runRecStateT  RecStateT s m a gt Knot s gt m a, Knot s runRecStateT RecStateT st  S.runStateT st  tie  MonadFix m gt RecStateT s m a gt s gt m a, s tie m s  do   rec a, Knot s  lt runRecStateT m Knot s s   return a, s  get  Monad m gt RecStateT s m Knot s get  RecStateT S.get  put  Monad m gt s gt RecStateT s m  put s  RecStateT  S.modify   Knot  s gt Knot s s codepre  pThe codetiecode function is where the magic happens the call to coderunRecStateTcode produces a value and a state, which I feed it as its own future. Note that codegetcode allows you to read from both the past and future states, but codeputcode only allows you to modify the present.p  pstrongQuestion 1strong Does this seem like a decent way to implement this knottying pattern in general Or better still, has somebody implemented a general solution to this, that I overlooked when snooping through Hackage I beat my head against the codeContcode monad for a while, since it seemed possibly more elegant see a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions10560124usingconttoacquirevaluesfromthefutureandthepastsimilar posta from Dan Burton, but I just couldnt work it out.p  pstrongTotally subjective Question 2strong Im not totally thrilled with the way my calling code ends up lookingp  precodedo   Knot past future lt get   let  ...   past        ...   future       node   ...    put   ...    return node codepre  pImplementation details here omitted, obviously, the important point being that I have to get the codepastcode and codefuturecode state, patternmatch them eminside a let bindingem or explicitly make the previous pattern lazy to extract whatever I care about, then build my node, update my state and finally return the node.

Negative 1011 pI am new to entity framework and MVC, and trying to understand what constitutes a good design approach for a new application.p  pThere are several ways of using Entity Framework. However, for my project, the best looking option is DB First. Ive played around with an EDMX file, and I have got as far as using the DbContext code generator to create my wrapper classes.p  pI plan on using the repository and unitofwork patterns, and using ninject for DI.p  pHowever, it does not seem proper, from a SoC point of view, that whilst my respository will hide the implementation of the data store EF from my code, the model classes themselves are very much EF flavoured.p  pIt seems that using EDMXbased approaches to EF blur the separation of concerns. Only POCO support seems to allow a true separation, but POCO has some other limitations that I dont like.p  pAm I missing something, or does using EDMX have this drawbackp  pAre people using an auto mapper to convert between the entity model and another, clean, SoCced modelp  pthanksp  pTianp

Negative 1011 pI have a tricky shipping issue that Im trying to work out. I have a custom extension that calculates the table rates for all of the domestic shipping. But for international, one type of productcategory A is a flat 35product shipping fee and the rest of the products categories B and C are calculated by UPS and USPS. The only way Ive been able to figure out how to properly calculate shipping if a customer purchases both types of products is to create a table rate for Category A, then pass it along to UPSUSPS as a handling fee.

Negative 1011 pI am working on a LAN based solution with a server that has to control a number of players My protocol of choice is UDP because its easy, I do not need connections, my traffic consists only of short commands from time to time and I want to use a mix of broadcast messages for syncing and single target messages for player individual commands.p  pMulticast TCP would be an alternative, but its more complicated, not exactly suited for the task and often not well supported by hardware.p  pUnfortunately I am running into a strange problemp  pstrongThe first datagram which is sent to a specific ip using sendto is lost.strong Any datagram sent short time afterwards to the same ip is received. But if i wait some time a few minutes the first sendto is lost again.p  pBroadcast datagrams always work. Local sends to the same computer always work.p  pI presume the operating system or the routerswitch has some translation table from IP to MAC addresses which gets forgotten when not being used for some minutes and that unfortunately causes datagrams to be lost. I could observe that behaviour with different routerswitch hardware, so my suspect is the windows networking layer.p  pI know that UDP is by definition unreliable but I cannot believe that this goes so far that even if the physical connection is working and everything is well defined packets can get lost. Then it would be literally worthless.p  pTechnically I am opening an UDP Socket, bind it to a port and INADRRANY. Then I am using sendto and recvfrom. I never do a connect  I dont want to because I have several players. As far as I know UDP should work without connect.p  pMy current workaround is that I regularly send dummy datagrams to all specific player ips  that solves the problem but its somehow unsatisfyingp  pstrongQuestionstrong Does anybody know that problem Where does it come from How can I solve itp  pEditp  pI boiled it down to the following test programp  precodeint tmainint argc, TCHAR argv[]      WSADATA wsaData     WSAStartupMAKEWORD2, 2, ampwsaData     SOCKET Sock  socketAFINET, SOCKDGRAM, IPPROTOUDP     SOCKADDRIN Local  0     Local.sinfamily  AFINET     Local.sinaddr.Sun.Saddr  htonlINADDRANY     Local.sinport  htons1234     bindSock, SOCKADDRampLocal, sizeofLocal     printfPress any key to send...n     int Ret, i  0     char Buf[4096]      SOCKADDRIN Remote  0     Remote.sinfamily  AFINET     Remote.sinaddr.Sun.Saddr  inetaddr192.168.1.12   Replace this with a valid LAN IP which is not the hosts one     Remote.sinport  htons1235      whiletrue          getch         sprintfBuf, ping d, i         printfMultiple sending sn, Buf           Ret  connectSock, SOCKADDRampRemote, sizeofRemote          if Ret  SOCKETERROR printfConnect Errorn, Buf         Ret  sendtoSock, Buf, strlenBuf, 0, SOCKADDRampRemote, sizeofRemote         if Ret  strlenBuf printfSend Errorn, Buf         Ret  sendtoSock, Buf, strlenBuf, 0, SOCKADDRampRemote, sizeofRemote         if Ret  strlenBuf printfSend Errorn, Buf         Ret  sendtoSock, Buf, strlenBuf, 0, SOCKADDRampRemote, sizeofRemote         if Ret  strlenBuf printfSend Errorn, Buf              return 0 codepre  pThe Program opens an UDP Socket, and sends 3 datagrams in a row on every keystroke to a specific IP. Run that whith wireshark observing your UDP traffic, press a key, wait a while and press a key again. You do not need a receiver on the remote IP, makes no difference, except you wont get the black marked not reachable packets. This is what you getp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.com4kdzf.png altWireshark Snapshotp  pAs you can see the first sending initiated a ARP search for the IP. While that search was pending the first 2 of the 3 successive sends were lost. The second keystroke after the IP search was complete properly sent 3 messages. You may now repeat sending messages and it will work until you wait about a minute until the adress translation gets lost again then you will see dropouts again.p  pstrongThat means There is no send buffer when sending UDP messages and there are ARP requests pending All messages get lost except the last one. Also sendto does not block until it successfully delivered, and there is no error returnstrongp  pWell, that surprises me and makes me a little bit sad, because it means that I have to live with my current workaround or implement an ACK system that only sends one message at a time and then waits for reply  which would not be easy any more and imply many difficulties.p

Negative 1011 pIm having a bit of problem with marshaling and I just cant figure it out by myself.

Also a WCHAR pointer is passed along, where the function writes back a corresponding GUID which is associated with the passed UPN. The guidSize pointer supplies the size of the pointer, if its too small the written GUID is not fully written. If everything goes fine the function should return 0 it never happened yet, when called from cp  pNow my efforts to invoke and call this function look like thisp  precode[DllImportMyDll.dll, EntryPoint  MyFunction, CallingConvention  CallingConvention.Cdecl, CharSet  CharSet.Unicode] public static extern long MyFunctionIntPtr upnPtr, long upnSize, [Out, MarshalAsAttributeUnmanagedType.LPWStr ] StringBuilder guidPtr, IntPtr guidSizePtr   my attempt to call the Dlls exposed function string upn  foobar.com long upnSize  upn.Length IntPtr upnPtr  Marshal.StringToHGlobalUniupn  IntPtr guidSizePtr  Marshal.AllocHGlobalsizeoflong Marshal.WriteInt32GuidSizePtr, 128 var guidSB  new StringBuilder128  result  MyFunctionupnPtr, upnSize, guidSB, guidSizePtr codepre  pas a result I receive an AccessViolationException.

Negative 1011 pIs there any R package or C that has sieve bootstrap The bootstrap is a method for estimating the distribution of an estimator or test statistic  by resampling ones data or a model estimated from the data. This is  more complicated when the data are a time series because bootstrap  sampling must be carried out in a way that suitably captures the dependence structure of the data generation process.

Negative 1011 pI have a project upgraded from Visual Studio 2010 to 2012 and the .testrunconfig file was included in the upgrade process. p  pI noticed that it was possible to click Analyze code coverage on any of the unit tests that I had run and it would correctly display the result. However, my test run configuration originally from VS 2010 had code coverage disabled.p  pAfter doing a bit of research I learned that the VS 2010 configuration files have been deprecated and replaced by .runsettings files.  It would appear that VS 2012 enforces assembly instrumentation by default which has a massive overhead associated with it.p  pTherefore, I would like to know how I can disable code coverage in VS 2012. Based upon my current findings it does not seem to be a trival task. One recent article I read had me creating an XML file manually and naming it MYCONFIGURATION.runsettings and manually manipulating XML attribute values.p  pDoes anyone know how this should be donep

And I am also hesitant of simply changing the generated code in case we need to update the service reference, so some sort of data type mapping via a config would be ideal.p  pThanks allp  pExample snippet of the WSDL we consumep  precodeltxselement minOccurs0 nameblub typexsnonNegativeInteger gt codepre  pExample snippet of the generated WCF client codep  precodeltSystem.Xml.Serialization.XmlElementAttributeDataTypenonNegativeInteger, Order0gt    Property blub As String codepre

I think I was about to figure out how to successfully do a deep copy. Ive updated my code to show what I have completed so far. Now that I have compiled the code, Ive gotten a new error. unhandled exception 0xc0000005 every time I run it. I googled it and believe it to be an error caused by attempting to dereference a null pointer. The debugger shows it is thrown in my releaseNodes method.p  precodevoid TextAnalyzerreleaseNodes  Node del  tail  whiletail  NULL      tail  tailgtprevious error on this line     tailgtnext  del     delete del     del  tail    delete [] head delete [] tail  head  tail  del  NULL  codepre  pAbove is just my releaseNodes method, with a comment showing where the debugger says the error originates. Id like to see if the rest of my code works since I am new to C and it is very likely my logic is flawed elsewhere as well, unfortunately until this error is resolved I cant test anything.

Negative 1011 pHello im working on a project using SDL library, im quite new to it and trying to get a hang of it... Im not sure if its possible but im trying to make a background map that is independent to the camera. Lets say that background would be parent function to the camera and it would have its own coordinates, like lets say example League of Legends the map is loaded at the start of the game and every player, monster, etc. is updated its position and everything else and you move the camera freely on the map. Right now I believe that your camera the screen is the parent and it has the coordinates of its own and it is actually background moving on the screen and not the camera moving on the map. I would be really thankful for any help or the info on how to make that if its even possible.p

Negative 1011 pI am developing an application for Linux RHEL, Gnome, Compiz in Qt 4.8 using a QGraphicsScene with QGraphicsViews for each monitor. Each QGraphicsView has the QtX11Bypasswindowmanagerhint window hint. In order to restore keyboard focus, I have an event handler that calls activateWindow on exactly one of the QGraphicsViews for every event which I realize is likely overkill and incredibly inefficient. The application is one where the user may request to hide and show it often when I call show on that same particular QGraphicsView that is being activated in the event handler, an X11 error event occurs. In particular, the error has an error code of 8, which corresponds to a BadMatch error, and major operation code of 42, which I believe corresponds to XSetInputFocus.p  pFirst, is this an error that can be simply ignored via a custom x11 event handler because the application in fact works  Second, is there a better way to call activateWindow when using this particular window hint with a QGraphicsView And if not, is there at least a way to avoid this errorp

Negative 1011 pIve written a correctly working multithreaded code in vs2012. What Im surprised about, is that I detach nearly 10000 threads, and it works with no issues. Obviously that quantity of threads cannot be handled simultaneously, so some of them are suspended until the others work. p  pI would like to know if there exists some option in vs2012 to set the maximal quantity of threads allowed to work simultaneously.

Negative 1011 pSo the scenario is that Im using an SB queue to throttle outgoing callbacks to other services. One of the standard problems with calling back to other services is that they may be down for uncontrollable amounts of time. Assuming I detect that the target is downnot responding, what is the best pattern for abandoning that message so that it doesnt reappear on the queue immediatelyp  pHeres are some approaches Im either aware of, have tried or am consideringp  ul lipObviously if I just use codeBrokeredMessageAbandoncode the message will be unlocked and put back on the queue. This is obviously undesirable for this scenario and what Im trying to avoid.pli lipIf I just ignore the fact that I ran into an error and never call Abandon this will keep it from showing up immediately, but I dont really have fine grained control over how long until it shows up again and I would like to implement a decaying retry strategy.pli lipI thought maybe I could call codeBrokeredMessageAbandonIDictionaryltstring, objectgtcode and somehow update the codeScheduledEnqueueTimeUTCcode property, but I have tried this and there doesnt seem to be a way to affect that property beyond the initial sending of the message. Makes sense, but thought worth a try.pli lipI have considered just using codeBrokeredMessageCompletecode in this situation and actually just enqueueing a new emcopyem of the message with the codeScheduledEqueueTimeUTCcode property set.pli ul  pThe final bullet almost seems too heavy handed, but Im coming to the conclusion its probably the right answer given the inherent nature of queues. I just figured there might be a nicer way to do this within Azure SB queues that Im missing.p

Negative 1011 pI am having a problem getting querybased parameters to refresh in SSRS when the View Report or Refresh button is clicked.  To illustrate the problem, I created a report with 2 parameters.  1 parameter is set to get the timestamp Now using the SSRS function.  The other parameter is set to get the value GETDATE from a SQL Server database query.  When I view the report, both parameters accurately get the timestamp.  When I hit the View Report button or Refresh, neither parameter refreshes.  The only way I can get the timestamps to refresh is to reopen the page up in a new browser.  Is there anyway to get these timestamps to update without having to open a new pagesession  Thanksp

For example, if I want to create a program to manage web accounts, with each account having a variety of arbitrary keysvalues, can I save all these individual accounts to one archive as separate dictionariesp  pThanks in advance, and a noob would appreciate example code andor any suggestions.p

Negative 1011 pIm using the jQuery jTable plugin for a CRUD table within my ASP.Net MVC 3 application. Running the code on my development machine works fine. However when I move the code to the production server, I cannot add new eventsrows to jTable as I keep getting an error Form is not valid... which is being triggered in the controller by codeifModelState.IsValidcode. p  pSo next I grabbed the errors from the ModelState with codeModelState.Values.SelectManyv gt v.Errorscode and put them into a JSON response, and this is why my ModelState is invalid codeErrorMessageThe value 15082013 110000 is not valid for Timestamp.codep  pSo my question is, why is the that datestring okay for my development server but invalid for productionp  pAlso, the model which is invalid was created by EF Database First, so I havent set any DataAnnotations on my own. It seems that the default modelbinder doesnt work properly on my production system.p  pCould it possibly be due to the fact Im using DDMMYY instead of MMDDYY Its the Canadian way..p  pEDIT Ah ha It WAS because of the culture specific format, I first tried fixing it by switching the culture settings on the production environment from US to CA, but this still didnt fix it. So the next thing I did was added in a line into my codeWeb.configcode within the codesystem.webcode portion codeltglobalization requestEncodingutf8 responseEncodingutf8 cultureenCA uiCultureenCAgtcode and now things are working smoothly.

Negative 1011 pIm creating a form for which Im using tables to create the layout. All table cells have their content aligned to the top.

Though, sometimes cell 3 has more content  so much that it requires more height than 1 and 2, so the other cells get stretched out. That means there will be a large empty area in the bottom of cell 1.p  pSo, I want cell 1 to have always the minimum weight, so if cell 3 stretches out the table, the extra space will place itself in the bottom of cell 3. To achieve this I gave cell 1 a height of 1px in the css. Then itll always try to have a height of 1px, meaning itll have the least possible height at all times.p  pstrongIs this bad practice Does it work in all browsersstrongp  pEDIT Cell 3 has a 1px left border that I always want to follow the page until the bottom.

So my thought is that at the different sizes, I would have to pull all of the boxes out of the columns, delete the columns, and reappend the columns in different numbers based on the window width. This has proved to be a failed attempt, so if anyone can explain to me what Im doing wrong I would be very appreciativep  pThanksp
Negative 1011 pI want have a Producer Consumer Problem where only the newest Item shall be consumed. This problem may have a different name, but I couldnt figure it outp  pThe producer threads produce elements in a nonblocking fashion by overriting any old items. The single consumer thread should wait for an element to be created and consume it. p  pI thought about using a blocking queue but the java implementation does not allow for overriding old elements. A circular buffer like from the commons libary doesnt work either because its not blocking for the consumer. p  pIs there a datastructure that serves this purpose or do I need to find a better way p  pIt might also be possible to solve this with low level synchronization tools like locks but I couldnt figure out how to do it.p

The dll will write to a file when linked to a console application so I know the file IO code works.  It wont write to a file when linked to the web application.

Negative 1011 pExcuse me again, Im not any genius in Programming.p  pFirst of all, a summary array input. Two 3D vectors...ha ha, lets use vectors to calculate MORE vectors. Anyway dot product is just and plain ridiculous nine numerals before decimals I mean, seriously, I didnt ever thought that 1x87x54x2 could have NINE numerals. Cross product is...even worse.p  pI made the...uhm...how could I call it Well, we call it traza. Ill translate a definition ir order to get understood ema codes traza tell us the sequence of instructions of its execution, and how do the variables change after every line of codeem. You know, the table with variables and number marks referred to code lines where we look if the code is doing something unexpected. Getting to the point its everything fine as far as I could see.p  pThen, I made an unexpectedly pseudotraza with a print command and every value from the vectors. Just after input and just before te dot product in a function. Guess what 1 its not my input, in either of them 2 they are not even the same values 3 first values are far away from my input, but the following ones at least were more logic less difference to the input.p  pI learned this morning, 12 hours ago, to use arraysvectorswhatever. I didnt ever have any need to set as 0 as default any value before its input. But its the only thing I have known to do when things like this happened to me before.

Negative 1011 pThe general idea starts from creating a control, which would work with any database object. The database is accessed via LINQ to SQL, and database objects are autogenerated from the existing database.p  pTo make the control work with any of these objects, I use a base interface, which all the autogenerated objects inherit from. So the control actually works with that interface.p  pThis interface at first should providep  ol lian ability to get the identifier primary key of an objectli lian expression which would return this identifier, if compiled and called via an instance of an objectli ol  pSo this looks likep  precodepublic interface IEntityltTEntity, TEntityIdgt     where TEntity  IEntityltTEntity, TEntityIdgt     where TEntityId  IEquatableltTEntityIdgt      ExpressionltFuncltTEntity, TEntityIdgtgt GetIdExpression     TEntityId EntityId  get   codepre  pThen a database objects class definition would look likep  precodelet it be the autogenerated part public partial class Entity1      public Guid UId  get set   and the manual part public partial class Entity1  IEntityltEntity1, Guidgt      public ExpressionltFuncltEntity1, Guidgtgt GetIdExpression              return ExpressionltFuncltEntity1, Guidgtgtse gt se.UId          public Guid EntityId              get  return this.UId        codepre  pAnd we can test itp  precodevar e1  new Entity1 e1.UId  Guid.NewGuid Console.WriteLinee1.UId  Console.WriteLinee1.GetIdExpression.Compilee1 codepre  pThe output of these two lines is equal. Its OK.p  pThe next idea was, that the lion share of all database objects have codeintcode identifier with the name codeIdcode. And it would be much better to avoid editing every of them, i.e. not to write one and the same code implementing codeIEntityltTEntity, TEntityIdgtcode.p  pAs far as I need to specify the implementation of this interface, I need a class. For now I ended up with p  precodepublic class IntEntityltTEntitygt  IEntityltTEntity, intgt        where TEntity  IntEntityltTEntitygt      public int Id  get set       public ExpressionltFuncltTEntity, intgtgt GetIdExpression              return ExpressionltFuncltTEntity, intgtgte gt e.Id           public int EntityId              get  return this.Id        codepre  pThen the database object class would derive from itp  precodelet it be the autogenerated part public partial class Entity2      public int Id  get set   and the manual part public partial class Entity2  IntEntityltEntity2gt   codepre  pAlready now its obvious, that codeIdcode in codeEntity2code does hide the codeIdcode in codeIntEntityltTEntitygtcode. This is also proved by the same testp  precodevar re  new Entity2 re.Id  5 Console.WriteLinere.Id 5 Console.WriteLinere.GetIdExpression.Compilere 0 codepre  pSo this solution is wrong... I also tryed to make codeIntEntityltTEntitygtcode abstract, but obviously failed, as in codeEntity2code codeIdcode is defined in the autogenerated part, and I could not make it codeoverridecode the codeabstractcode codeIdcode of the base class.p  pIs there anything I can do to make all database objects with codeint Idcode use the codeIdcode from the base codeIntEntityltTEntitygtcode class. Or, probably, vice versa...p  pThe main point here is that the expression returned by codeGetIdExpressioncode should have the form codee gt e.Idcode, as this expresion would later be used in LINQ to SQL queries, so LINQ should be able to translate it to a correct SQL query.p
Negative 1011 pI notice some interesting behavior when it comes to building lists in different ways. code.appendcode takes longer than listcomprehensions, which take longer than codemapcode, as shown in the experiments belowp  precodedef squarex return x2  def appendtimetimes106   answer  []   start  time.clock   for i in rangetimes     answer.appendsquarei   end  time.clock   return endstart  def comptimetimes106   start  time.clock   answer  [squarei for i in rangetimes]   end  time.clock   return endstart  def maptimetimes106   start  time.clock   answer  mapsquare, rangetimes   end  time.clock   return endstart  for func in [appendtime, comptime, maptime]   prints s func.name, func codepre  pPython 2.7p  precodeappendtime 0.42632 comptime 0.312877 maptime 0.232474 codepre  pPython 3.3.3p  precodeappendtime 0.614167 comptime 0.5506650000000001 maptime 0.57115 codepre  pNow, I am very aware that coderangecode in python 2.7 builds a list, so I get why there is a disparity between the times of the corresponding functions in python 2.7 and 3.3. What I am more concerned about is the relative time differences between codeappendcode, listcomprehension and codemapcode.p  pAt first, I considered that this might be because codemapcode and list comprehensions may afford the interpreter knowledge of the eventual size of the resultant list, which would allow the interpreter to malloc a sufficiently large C array under the hood to store the list. By that logic, listcomprehensions and codemapcode should take pretty much the same amount of time.br However, the timing data shows that in python 2.7, listcomps are 1.36x as fast as codeappendcode, and codemapcode is 1.34x as fast as listcomps.br More curious is that in python 3.3, listcomps are 1.12x as fast as codeappendcode, and codemapcode is actually slower than listcomps.p  pClearly, codemapcode and listcomps dont play by the same rules clearly, map takes advantage of something that listcomps dont.br Could anybody shed some light on the reason behind the difference in these timing valuesp

Singleton session beans are designed for circumstances in which a single enterprise bean instance is shared across and concurrently accessed by clients.p  pI do understand perfectly what it is saying. However come to think of it, the word session is very misleading here. Since it exists at application level, the term session doesnt seem to apply here.p  pWhen i think of the word session, i think in terms of each individual user as a session.

Negative 1011 pI have been trying to write a program that counts rationals on the Cantor set with certain denominators.

It doesnt crash from 10 to 11p  pEDIT2 I implemented most of the suggestionscouldnt figure out how to remove the ifcoprimep,q and now it runs a little bit fasterless than a second difference at n10. Is there much else I can do to speed it up its only running 33 faster than my processor on the same task.p  pEDIT3 managed to implement it with bit twiddling. Not sure if there are any other conditionals I can do that to though. Still not seeing a very big performance boostany suggestionsp

Negative 1011 h2Questionh2  pI have a method to wrap functions by replacing them with a macro so that I can log the call and the return code.  Heres an example which worksp  precodeint rc int fooint a, int b int barint a, char b, int c  void    LogRetchar fn, char file, char from, int ln, int ret      printfs.s.d s  ret08xn, file, from, ln, fn, ret      define fooargs, ...  rc  fooargs, VAARGS, LogRetfoo, FILE, FUNCTION, LINE, rc, rc  define barargs, ...  rc  barargs, VAARGS, LogRetbar, FILE, FUNCTION, LINE, rc, rc codepre  pThe macro for the function it substitutes calls the function and logs the function name and where it was called from as well as the return code.  Wrapping any function uses the same syntax and just needs the function name replaced in the macro 3 times.  What I would like to do is create wrapper macro where the macro redefine for foo would be something similar top  precodedefine fooargs, ... WRAPPPERfoo codepre  pI understand the basics of stringify and double stringify but I cant even get the WRAPPER macro to do the real function call.  Ideally, Id like to get it down to single WRAPfoo statement.  The reason is, I have around 100 or more functions Id like to wrap and it would like to do it simple from one simple force include file. Im coming to the conclusion that its not possible but I thought Id ask here before abandoning the idea.  Im using clang and vc if that makes any difference but it would be nice to have this on any compiler as I debug a lot of different systems.p  hr  h2Adaptation of Jonathan Lefflers answerh2  pAs Im new here I wasnt sure if this should be a separate answer or and edit update.  This is essentially Jonathan Lefflers answer. Its in a functional example. While the 2 functions it calls are pointless, the goal was to have a macro that could wrap any function with any arg list. My main use is in logging the use flow in a large code library that has a problem.  Also, my original sample has one glaring weakness.  By storing the return code in a global it is not thread safe without cumbersome preparation in TLS. The global is now removed and the macro no longer uses the sequence operator to return the value, it is preserved and returned by the logging function. Also, as Augurar pointed out and shown in Jonathans example. If the macro is declared in the same file as the function declaration, it requires parentheses.p  precodeinclude ltstdio.hgt include ltstring.hgt  int fooint a, int b int barint a, char b, int c   if defined DEBUG   defined DEBUG  Short version of FILE without path requires runtime parsing define SFILE strrchrFILE,   strrchrFILE,   1  FILE ifdef WIN32   define WRAPPERfunc, ...

WRAPPERbar, VAARGS  endif   int mainvoid      int x  foo1, 2     bar2, doubled, ampx      return 0      ifdef foo   undef foo   undef bar endif   If and only if the function definition is in the same file with the macros, you must either undefine the macros or  parenthesize the function  e.g.   int fooint a, int b  ...   int fooint a, int b         printfd  d  dn, a, b, a  b     return a  b      int barint a, char b, int c      printfd  s  dn, c, b, a  c     return c  a  codepre  pRelease build outputp  precode1  2  3 3  doubled  6 codepre  pDebug build outputp  precode1  2  3 test.cpp.main.35 foo  ret00000003 3  doubled  6 test.cpp.main.36 bar  ret00000006 codepre  pThe main benefit is not having to find every occurrence of foo or bar in the code to insert a debug print to log the call and result or whatever debug code you want to insert.p

Negative 1011 pFrom looking at a lot of  Go code on GitHub, I have noticed that Go coders love the short variable declaration codecodeand use it very often. Heres an example a hrefhttpmattn.github.iogogtk relnofollowstrongCoding Stylestronga. But this usage seems far too often to create poorly structured code Very long functions that bundle lots of functionality together, because  a hrefhttpgolang.orgrefspecShortvariabledeclarations relnofollowstrongShort variable declarations may appear only inside functions.stronga   If you want to set up a package that encapsulates something akin to a class with members that several short, modularized functions operate on, as good structured programming and OOP practices mandate, you cant really use  short variable declarations effectively for member variables. I tend to get uneasy whenever I see any function thats more than 10 or 15 lines long  I know somethings probably not right with that design.p  pPersonally, Im not a big fan of  short variable declarations except for local initializion of loop counters, etc. Aside from the above mentioned issue, I like to see clearly the type Im working with. Particularly when looking over new code, short variable declarations assume that the reader knows what the function initializing the variable is returning, or obliges them to go and find out, or deduce it from the context. So, that code becomes less readable and requires the reader to stop, and perhaps search somewhere for its meaning, whereas acodevarcodedeclaration might make things immediately clear. p  pI suppose one way write better code and still use short variable declarations would be to avoid the use of package global members entirely and parameterize all your functions  not necessarily a bad thing  but this probably creates more work than you will save using short variable declarations.p  pAs a result I have been opting to use this sort of design for my packages, similar to the way declaration and initialization work in traditional OOP languages such as Delphi and Cp  precodepackage myPackage  import      importA     importB   var mmember1 importA.T var mmember2 importB.T  func init       mmember1  newimportA.T     mmember2  newimportB.T   codepre  pThen I have clearly typed, initialized and encapsulated package members that are available for use in the package. Yes, this does violate the good practice of initializing only when necessary, but I dont have to do this in init either  can do it on an as needed basis, when the member is used for the first time, although that has other potential complications.  Be that as it may, since initialization of class members in a codeconstructorcode has been common practice for a long time, I dont have much of problem with this, regardless.p  pIs this nonidiomatic, bad code in Go Is the abundant use of short variable declarations, with their IMO negative consequences, considered a good thing Frankly I fail to see how it could be. I tend to think that perhaps short variable declarations are being used too much by programmers who just love the short syntax, and the result is a lot of bloated looking spaghetti style code.

The best that can be done using the short form is nested, parameterized functions, which are generally not a very good design choice either.p  pSome complained that this amounts to globals, but in a well designed, encapsulated package with a minimal public interface, that is no more of an issue than declaring variables local to a function. Packages should be atomic. Member variables have been an accepted component of OOP design forever and when used properly, following the rules of OOP and structured programming, they are not globals, but locals to the package or module or class which encapsulates them. p  pGranted, there is no feature of any language that cannot be used, or abused. My question is simply that short variable declarations seem to be ripe for abuse and force certain design decisions that are less than desirable, unless used very discreetly. Im asking if there is a way to use the form that will circumvent the issues I have with them and afford me their ease of use without the drawbacks.p  pstrongEdit 2strongp  hr  pstrongPerhaps this is something of a compromisestrongp  precodepackage main  import         packageA  packageB       func dostuffa PackageA.T      a.Write     func doMorestuff    b PackageB.T       b.Write       func  doEvenMorestuffa a PackageA.T, b PackageB.T     a.Readb       func doLotsofstuffa a PackageA.T, b PackageB.T    a.ReadWritea,b  b.WriteReadb,a     func doStackofStuff      aPackageA.T     bPackageB.T      dostuffa     doMorestuffb     doEvenMorestuffa,b     doLotsofstuffa,b         func main       doStackofStuff codepre  pp  pStill bundled up in codemaincode but thats not really a complaint  codedoStackofStuffcode is my interface call.

Negative 1011 pIve created a Web API project in ASP.Net, and am having some trouble getting the authentication working.p  pThe API is expecting a token to be submitted in the Authorization header in each request.  The code that checks to see if the header is set checks if the p  blockquote   pHttpRequestMessage.Headers.Authorizationp blockquote  pproperty is null.  The first few times I tested this, I discovered that this property was always null, but the strange part is that if you checked the HttpRequestMessage.Headers enumerable, the Authorization header WAS set correctly also if you did HttpRequestMessage.Headers.ToString, it would appear there too.p  pStranger still, I found that if I removed some of the attributes that are sent in the token, I could get it to work as expected.  So it was as though the Authorization property wasnt being set if the header values character length was too long.  Unfortunately, even when manually removing some of the text from the token, it would then proceed to fail on a digest check, as it shouldp  pI cant find any documentation that mentions this, so I was wondering if anyone else has come across it  I dont think the header is too long for IIS, because the header value appears in HttpRequestMessage.Headers.ToString, so it IS being received, but for some reason its not being assigned to the Authorization property.p  pUnfortunately I cant rewrite the code that checks this property this seems the easy solution because its apart of the Thinktecture library ie not written by ourselves.p

Negative 1011 pIve been reading up on dependency injection and factories and all that as I am undertaking transforming a legacy code base to be more testable.  One statement that I have seen repeated multiple times is that You group all of the objects with the same lifetime into a single factory.  For example, that is a direct quote from this article a hrefhttpmisko.hevery.com20080821wherehaveallthesingletonsgone relnofollowhttpmisko.hevery.com20080821wherehaveallthesingletonsgoneap  pBut, nobody ever seems to say why, and Im not sure what the answer is.  Maybe its obvious and Im just missing it, but why couldnt a factory create objects of different lifetimes  If I have a factory that hands out new objects perhaps with a boostsharedptr, what does it matter if some of them live longer than othersp  pIt could be that Im missing something about the factory pattern or how it is supposed to be implemented.  So, please feel free to be thorough in your answer.  Thanks very much, I look forward to learning from you all.p  pP.S. I guess I should say what Im assuming a factory pattern is supposed to look likep  precodefor some set of class interfaces that I want to be able to create class Foo class Bar  I declare abstract interfaces for the factory of such an interface class FooFactory  public     virtual boostsharedptrltFoogt getFoo  0   class BarFactory  public     virtual boostsharedptrltBargt getBar  0   at this point I could have two different concrete factories, or I could just have one concrete factory class MyFactoryImpl  public FooFactory, public BarFactory  public     boostsharedptrltFoogt getFoo     boostsharedptrltBargt getBar  codepre  pThen, somewhere of course I have to instantiate my concrete factory class.  Is that the right idea  BTW the current code base just has static factory methods, no factory interface, no concrete factory instance, just global static methods that create the classes. So, any comments on the proper implementation of factories are welcome as well as my main question what does object lifetime have to do with which objects are made by the same factory  I would think to just group objects to factories by what link dependencies it is going to introduce.p

I also sample the normal from the depth buffer.p  pstrongEDITstrong At first I thought I was getting the depth position incorrectly so I added a new function called positionFromDepth, but it still doesnt seem to work...p  pMy fragment shaderp  precodeuniform sampler2D uDepthBuffer uniform sampler2D uNoiseTexture  uniform mat4 uProjection  cameras projection matrix uniform mat4 uInverseMatrix  inverse of projection matrix uniform vec2 uNoiseScale  vec21024.0  4.0, 768.0  4.0  const int MAXKERNELSIZE  128  uniform int uSampleKernelSize uniform vec3 uSampleKernel[MAXKERNELSIZE]  uniform float uRadius  const float zNear  0.1 const float zFar  2579.5671  float linearizeDepthfloat near, float far, float depth      return 2.0  near  far  near  depth  far  near   vec3 positionFromDepthvec2 texcoords      float d  linearizeDepthzNear, zFar, texture2DuDepthBuffer, texcoords.r     vec4 pos  uInverseMatrix  vec4texcoords.x  2.0  1.0,                                      texcoords.y  2.0  1.0,                                      d  2.0  1.0, 1.0      pos.xyz  pos.w      return pos.xyz   vec3 normalfromdepthfloat depth, vec2 texcoords    const vec2 offset1  vec20.0, 0.001   const vec2 offset2  vec20.001, 0.0    float depth1  linearizeDepthzNear, zFar, texture2DuDepthBuffer, texcoords  offset1.r   float depth2  linearizeDepthzNear, zFar, texture2DuDepthBuffer, texcoords  offset2.r    vec3 p1  vec3offset1, depth1  depth   vec3 p2  vec3offset2, depth2  depth    vec3 normal  crossp1, p2   normal.z  normal.z    return normalizenormal   void main      vec2 texcoord  glTexCoord[0].st      vec3 origin  positionFromDepthtexcoord      float d  texture2DuDepthBuffer, texcoord.r     vec3 normal  normalfromdepthlinearizeDepthzNear, zFar, d, texcoord  2.0  1.0     normal  normalizenormal      vec3 rvec  texture2DuNoiseTexture, texcoord  uNoiseScale.rgb  2.0  1.0     vec3 tangent  normalizervec  normal  dotrvec, normal     vec3 bitangent  crossnormal, tangent     mat3 tbn  mat3tangent, bitangent, normal      float occlusion  0.0      forint i  0 i lt uSampleKernelSize i          vec3 sample  tbn  uSampleKernel[i]         sample  sample  uRadius  origin.xyz          vec4 offset  vec4sample, 1.0         offset  uProjection  offset         offset.xy  offset.w         offset.xy  offset.xy  0.5  0.5          float sampleDepth  positionFromDepthoffset.xy.z         occlusion  sampleDepth lt sample.z  1.0  0.0           occlusion  1.0  occlusion  floatuSampleKernelSize     glFragColor  vec4powocclusion, 4.0  codepre  pThe occluded samples changes when I move my camera around.

Negative 1011 pI wrote the below test using mstest, Ive got an Excel sheet with about 20 lines on it, test runs once for each line and the TestContexts DataRow property is populated with the data for that line.  The TestContext object is passed to the PopulateCustomerViaDataSource method for the customer object to be populated with the customer details from the Excel sheet, and the customer object is then passed to a web method for the details to be imported into another application.  So basically all the data for the specific test run is accessible using one object, i.e. TestContext, which doesnt even have to be passed to the test, so populating Customer objects for example are easy as pie.p  precode[DataSourceSystem.Data.Odbc, DsnExcel FilesDriverMicrosoft Excel Driver .xlsdbqDataDirectoryData.xlsdefaultdir.driverid790maxbuffersize2048pagetimeout5readonlytrue, ApVendorImportCreate, DataAccessMethod.Sequential, TestMethod] public void CustomerImportCreateVendor      Customer customer  CustomerImportHelpers.PopulateCustomerViaDataSourceTestContext     Result result      using SomeWebService client  new SomeWebService              result  client.CustomerImportcustomer           Assert.IsTrueresult.Success, Customer import was unsuccessful.  Returned error message was   result.Message       AssertCustomerInfoSavedCorrectlycustomer  codepre  pNow my question is how do I achieve a result similar to this using xUnit.  Ive been trying for a while now but not getting it right and Ive been googling but not able to find an article  post that demonstrates this specifically.

Negative 1011 pI have objects with lots of boolean properties, so I am using bitfields to pack the properties more compact. I also want to be able to serialize and deserializa those properties in a compact way, e.g. not field by field but by serializing and deserializing the 64 bit uint that holds the fields. This way is not only much faster e.g. avoid all the shifting and stuff but 8 times more memory efficient.p  pHowever, I read that the standard provides no guarantee that bitfield implementation will be uniform across different platforms. Can I expect that bulk binary serialization of the bitfield container will produce uniform results across platforms Or perhaps it will be safer to go for manual shifting and masking when working with the properties so that bulk serialization and deserialization is possiblep

Negative 1011 pI am experiencing an issue  does not belong to table in the WCF web service. This is because of the overwritten datatable by another thread with other schema. I have debugged by implementing the logs and found that the whole schema and data was changed with another database call which was called after the first one in sequence. This is really surprised for me that how the memory instance of the first datatable object is overwritten with the second one when this is not declared as static. I used thread locking but unfortunately it doesnt work. I am quit sure this is MS bug, but there might be a solution which I dont know so far.p  pHere is the sequence of method calls First I fill the datatable with user credentials for user authentication, this datatable has only three columns and one row. Second I fill another datatable with some other data which is required to process the request, then I fill one more table which is also required to process the request.p  pSometimes, the error pops up on the first datatable that  does not belong to the table and sometimes it is appeared on the second datatable. When I logged the table schema it was totally changed with the second one.p  pHere is the code of first datatablep  precodepublic UserCredentials GetUserCredentialsstring userName                  try                      UserCredentials userCredentials  null              using SqlCommand cmd  new SqlCommand                                  DataTable dt  new DataTableUser                     cmd.CommandText  dbo.[stored procedure]                     cmd.Connection  this.connection                     cmd.CommandType  CommandType.StoredProcedure                     cmd.Parameters.AddWithValueUserName, userName                      using SqlDataAdapter sda  new SqlDataAdapter                                              sda.SelectCommand  cmd                         sda.Filldt                                           if dt  null ampamp dt.Rows.Count gt 0                                              userCredentials  new UserCredentials                         userCredentials.UserName  userName                         userCredentials.SiteID  dt.Rows[0][SiteID].ToString                         userCredentials.Password  dt.Rows[0][Passphrase].ToString                                                    return userCredentials                  catch Exception ex                      throw ex                codepre  pSecond datatablep  precodepublic GatewayProfile GetGatewayProfilestring siteID                      Int64 gatewayID  0             string submitterID               GatewayProfile gatewayProfile  null              try                              this.OpenConnection                  DataTable dtGateway  new DataTableGTDetails                 using SqlCommand cmd  new SqlCommand                                      cmd.CommandText  dbo.[stored procedure]                     cmd.Connection  this.connection                     cmd.CommandType  CommandType.StoredProcedure                     cmd.Parameters.AddWithValueSiteID, siteID                      using SqlDataAdapter sda  new SqlDataAdapter                                              sda.SelectCommand  cmd                         sda.FilldtGateway                                                        if dtGateway  null ampamp dtGateway.Rows.Count gt 0                                      gatewayProfile  new GatewayProfile                      if Convert.ToBooleandtGateway.Rows[0][IsDefault]  false                                              gatewayID  Convert.ToInt64dtGateway.Rows[0][GatewayID]                         submitterID  dtGateway.Rows[0][SubmitterID].ToString                                           DataTable dtRoute  new DataTableRTDetails                     using SqlCommand cmd  new SqlCommand                                              cmd.CommandText  dbo.[stored procedure]                         cmd.Connection  this.connection                         cmd.CommandType  CommandType.StoredProcedure                         cmd.Parameters.AddWithValueGatewayID, gatewayID                         cmd.Parameters.AddWithValueSubmitterID, submitterID                          using SqlDataAdapter sda  new SqlDataAdapter                                                      sda.SelectCommand  cmd                             sda.FilldtRoute                                                                    if dtRoute  null ampamp dtRoute.Rows.Count gt 0                                              gatewayProfile.GatewayID  Convert.ToInt64dtRoute.Rows[0][GatewayID]                         gatewayProfile.SubmitterID  dtRoute.Rows[0][SubmitterID].ToString.Trim                         gatewayProfile.ReceiverID  dtRoute.Rows[0][ReceiverID].ToString.Trim                         gatewayProfile.AuthInfo  ReplaceDBNulldtRoute.Rows[0][AuthInfo], .Trim                         gatewayProfile.SecurityInfo  ReplaceDBNulldtRoute.Rows[0][SecurityInfo], .Trim                                                        return gatewayProfile                          catch Exception ex                              throw ex                          finally                               this.CloseConnection                       codepre  pThird datatablep  precodeusing SqlCommand cmd  new SqlCommand      cmd.CommandText  dbo.[stored procedure]     cmd.Connection  this.connection     cmd.CommandType  CommandType.StoredProcedure     cmd.Parameters.AddWithValueparam1, param1     cmd.Parameters.AddWithValueparam2, param2     cmd.Parameters.AddWithValueparam3, param3     cmd.Parameters.AddWithValueparam4, param4      using SqlDataAdapter sda  new SqlDataAdapter              sda.SelectCommand  cmd         sda.Filldt       codepre  pThank you in advance if someone help me out to get this issue resolved.p

Negative 1011 pI am running a project that has the option of using either .json files or java RESTful service getting the data from a database.  I have the about 6 RESTful specific files in my trunk and 6 specific .json files in my branches folder. However other than those 6 files, both the trunk and branch folders have hundreds of other files that are identical to each other. p  pMy question is, is there a way for me to keep those 6 files separate, but have both the trunk and the branch run off of the same hundred files that are identical Maybe through SVN somehowp  pI know its confusing. But since those 6 files are the same I cant ever merge them back together, and dont plan to.p  pThanksp

Negative 1011 pSo I was asked to write a program that tests whether a sequence of integers input by the user is a palindrome or not reads same backwards as forwards. I cant figure out how to dynamically allocate memory so that the input can be of variable length. In the code you can see that the user enters the number of elements in their sequence, n.

Negative 1011 pI have a problem with Internet Explorer and Firefox Chrome is able to handle it well. I have a html index file, that displays a datatablejquery plugin via onclickajaxrequest to a php file, that interacts with the db and gets the data. I then added some sort of messageboardfeatures One column in the table features an icon you can click on. Clicking on it opens a little form field, where you can write something about the specific entryrow. Clicking on a second icon will display all comments made to that specific tableentry. Inserting and displaying to and from the db works great  however i have a problem with the display of the form in IEFFp  pThe table is quite long and features a lot of entries. When im in the middle of the table, click on the formwritingicon and the form opens up, IE and FF will just jump to a different location in the table. Same happens, if i close the form again via clicking on the reset or submit button. It just jumps to wherever in the table and its very inconvenient to use it this way, because you have to seek out the entry again. Chrome somehow handles it well  opening and closing the form doesnt affect the focus of your browser. So, is there a way to force IE to stay in focus Id be really glad if someone could help p  pThe html index insert form part of my code looks as follows i dont know if its relevant to problem solving, i guess it kind of looks like an impertinence  i used a lot of questionable workarounds to do things, so just disregard i guessp  precodefunction to insert textarea                     function insertTextarea                              if  this .parentstr.findtdeq0.text  1                              var boardInfo    ltform idboardCommentgtlttextarea placeholderNotizen Fragen Kommentare rows2 cols27gtlttextareagtPrivatltinput typecheckbox nameprivatecheckbox idprivatecheckboxgtReminderltinput typecheckbox nameremindercheckbox idremindercheckbox checkedgtltinput typesubmit valueSubmitgtltinput typereset valueCancelgtltformgt                                                            else                              var boardInfo   ltform idboardCommentgtlttextarea placeholderNotizen Fragen Kommentare rows2 cols27gtlttextareagtPrivatltinput typecheckbox nameprivatecheckbox idprivatecheckboxgtReminderltinput typecheckbox nameremindercheckbox idremindercheckboxgtltinput typesubmit valueSubmitgtltinput typereset valueCancelgtltformgt                                                          console.logthis, this .parentstr.findtdeq0.text                              this .parent.appendboardInfo                             tbody img.hide                             textarea.focus                             boardComment.on submit, function event                                   event.preventDefault                                  var changeid                                   changeid[id]  this.parent.attrid                                  console.logthis.parent.attrid                                 changeid[comment]  this.findtextarea.val                                 changeid[privatecheckbox]  input[nameprivatecheckbox], this.ischecked  1  0                                  get remindercheckbox                                 changeid[remindercheckbox]  input[nameremindercheckbox], this.ischecked  1  0                                    console.logval, this.findtextarea.val                                 console.logtext, this.findtextarea.text                                 if this.findtextarea.val                                       .ajax                                         type POST,                                         url boardinfo2private.php,                                         cache false,                                         data changeid,                                         success function response2                                               alertYour comment has been saved                                             tbody img.show                                               changeid[id].findform.remove                                             console.logresponse2                                             console.logthis                                             console.log  changeid[id]                                             console.logchangeid[remindercheckbox]                                             console.log  changeid[id].parent                                             console.log  changeid[id].parent.findtd                                             if changeid[remindercheckbox]  1                                                  console.logrem checkbox 1                                                   changeid[id].parent.addClassReminds                                                   changeid[id].parent.findtdeq0.html1                                                 input[nameremindercheckbox], this.propchecked, true                                                                                          else if   changeid[id].parent.hasClassReminds                                                    changeid[id].parent.removeClassReminds                                                   changeid[id].parent.findtdeq0.html0                                                 input[nameremindercheckbox], this.propchecked, false                                                                                                                                                                                                                        boardComment.on reset, function event                                   event.preventDefault                                 tbody img.show                                  this .parent.findform.remove                                  this .parent.focus                                                                                .boardinfo img .on click, insertTextarea  codepre

Negative 1011 pI managed to fix the previous linking problem I had with NDK which was caused by android api 21, and managed to get SDLTTF built and working easily, but with SDLMixer I bumped into another runtime Unsatisfiedlinkererror where the app somehow cant link smpeg2 lib with SDL2Mixer. This time I dont see how it could have anything to do with apilevel and have tried everything I could come up with, gone through every makefile and triplechecked every version.p  pI am using SDLMixer 2.0.0 and smpeg22.0.0 as its only dependecy. Smpeg2 is located in jni folder and the whole thing is built without compiler coughing.p  pI downloaded SDLMixer 2.0.0 source and put it in jni folder, copied smpeg22.0.0 from its external folder to jni and set from mixer makefile to build only smpeg2. I edited srcAndroid.mk to see the mixer source and get the shared lib and then edited SDLActivity to pull SDL2mixer library. SDLTTF worked this way.p  plibsmpeg2.so DOES exist in libs folder so I dont see how it cant find it.p  pI am using android19 as build target for NDK, no warnings or errors are given by the compiler.p  precode0122 181743.760 Ddalvikvm22101 Trying to load lib datadatacom.kebabkeisari.peliliblibSDL2.so 0x41d88e78 0122 181743.760 Ddalvikvm22101 Added shared lib datadatacom.kebabkeisari.peliliblibSDL2.so 0x41d88e78 0122 181743.760 Ddalvikvm22101 Trying to load lib datadatacom.kebabkeisari.peliliblibSDL2mixer.so 0x41d88e78 0122 181743.765 Wdalvikvm22101 Exception LjavalangUnsatisfiedLinkError thrown while initializing LorglibsdlappSDLActivity 0122 181743.765 Wdalvikvm22101 Class init failed in newInstance call LcomkebabkeisaripeliRibale 0122 181743.765 DAndroidRuntime22101 Shutting down VM 0122 181743.765 Wdalvikvm22101 threadid1 thread exiting with uncaught exception group0x410c52a0 0122 181743.765 EAndroidRuntime22101 FATAL EXCEPTION main 0122 181743.765 EAndroidRuntime22101 java.lang.ExceptionInInitializerError 0122 181743.765 EAndroidRuntime22101    at java.lang.Class.newInstanceImplNative Method 0122 181743.765 EAndroidRuntime22101    at java.lang.Class.newInstanceClass.java1319 0122 181743.765 EAndroidRuntime22101    at android.app.Instrumentation.newActivityInstrumentation.java1057 0122 181743.765 EAndroidRuntime22101    at android.app.ActivityThread.performLaunchActivityActivityThread.java2015 0122 181743.765 EAndroidRuntime22101    at android.app.ActivityThread.handleLaunchActivityActivityThread.java2125 0122 181743.765 EAndroidRuntime22101    at android.app.ActivityThread.access600ActivityThread.java140 0122 181743.765 EAndroidRuntime22101    at android.app.ActivityThreadH.handleMessageActivityThread.java1227 0122 181743.765 EAndroidRuntime22101    at android.os.Handler.dispatchMessageHandler.java99 0122 181743.765 EAndroidRuntime22101    at android.os.Looper.loopLooper.java137 0122 181743.765 EAndroidRuntime22101    at android.app.ActivityThread.mainActivityThread.java4898 0122 181743.765 EAndroidRuntime22101    at java.lang.reflect.Method.invokeNativeNative Method 0122 181743.765 EAndroidRuntime22101    at java.lang.reflect.Method.invokeMethod.java511 0122 181743.765 EAndroidRuntime22101    at com.android.internal.os.ZygoteInitMethodAndArgsCaller.runZygoteInit.java1006 0122 181743.765 EAndroidRuntime22101    at com.android.internal.os.ZygoteInit.mainZygoteInit.java773 0122 181743.765 EAndroidRuntime22101    at dalvik.system.NativeStart.mainNative Method 0122 181743.765 EAndroidRuntime22101 Caused by java.lang.UnsatisfiedLinkError Cannot load library linkimage[1892]  1952 could not load needed library libsmpeg2.so for libSDL2mixer.so loadlibrary[1094] Library libsmpeg2.so not found 0122 181743.765 EAndroidRuntime22101    at java.lang.Runtime.loadLibraryRuntime.java370 0122 181743.765 EAndroidRuntime22101    at java.lang.System.loadLibrarySystem.java535 0122 181743.765 EAndroidRuntime22101    at org.libsdl.app.SDLActivity.ltclinitgtSDLActivity.java51 0122 181743.765 EAndroidRuntime22101    ... 15 more codepre

Negative 1011 pI have a Bluetooth server socket that accepts incoming connections. When I call accept, a BluetoothSocket is returned which I use to get information about the device that is connecting with the server by calling getRemoteDevice. This all works OK, however, when I get the name of the remote device, it displays a cached name. Lets say have a client connecting to the server and the client has Bluetooth device name A. It connects to the server, and the server will output that device A has been connected. However, I decide to change the name of the clients Bluetooth device name to B. When I connect to the server again, the server still thinks that the clients Bluetooth device name is A. p  pIs there anyway for me to prevent this caching Or, at least, is there a way for me to get the latest, updated device namep  pIve seen that some people use fetchUuidsWithSdp.

Anyone have any ideas on how to get the most uptodate name from the client Bluetooth device My project is at a standstill because of this ONE issue.p

Negative 1011 pA short description of my problem is as followsp  pI developed a function that calls a CUDA kernel. My function receives a pointer to the host data buffers input and output of kernel, and has no control over the allocation of these buffers. p  p It is possible that the host data was allocated with either of malloc or cudaHostAlloc. My function is not specifically told which allocation method was used.p  pThe question is what is a feasible way for my function to figure out whether the host buffers are pinnedpagelocked cudaHostAlloc or not regular mallocp  pThe reason I am asking is that if they are not pagelocked, I would like to use cudaHostRegister to make them the buffers so, to make them amenable for streams.p  pI have tried three ways which have failed 1 Always apply cudaHostRegister this way is not good if the host buffers are already pinned 2 Run cudaPointerGetAttributes, and if the return error is cudaSuccess, then the buffers are already pinned, nothing to do else if cudaErrorInvalidValue, apply cudaHostRegister  for some reason this way results in the kernel execution returning an error 3 Run cudaHostGetFlags, and if return is not a success, then apply cudaHostRegister  same behavior as 2.p  pIn the case of 2 and 3, the error is invalid argumentnp  pNote that my code currently is not using streams, rather always calls cudaMemcpy for the entire host buffers. If I do not use any of the three above ways, my code runs to completion, regardless of whether the host buffer is pinned or not.p  pAny advice Many thanks in advance.p

Negative 1011 pIm using Caliburn.Micro CM in a WPF application with ViewModelfirst approach. Im composing the main view with a command bar and an active item. Main viewModel sets the property for the command bar viewModel, and navigates to active item correctly. p  pEverything looks fine at runtime, the issue is strongonlystrong related to designtime the main view shows empty in designer and I cannot find how to set it correctly. I managed to having this working in other scenarios, e.g. when setting the datacontext at design time for a whole Window or UserControl, i.e. when thats the root UI element in XAML.

Negative 1011 pI want to create some unittests with testdata. We use codeActiveRecordcode for our database.p  pThe idea is, that we have a script, which create an XML file with testdata. In our Unittest we can create an article from this XML and make some tests. The structure of the database can change, so we have the recreate our testdata in an easyshort way.p  pNow I have different problems.p  pFirst off all, here is a simple Example of the tablesp  precode[Serializable] [ActiveRecordTable  Order, Lazy  true] public class Order  Entity      [HasManytypeof Article, Lazy  true, Inverse  true, OrderBy  Id]     public virtual IListltArticlegt Articles  get set    [Serializable] [ActiveRecordTable  Article, Lazy  true] public class Article  Entity      [PropertyNotNull  true, Update  false]     public virtual string Name  get set   codepre  pI dont want the change my entity classes. Maybe some little changes. I tried a XML SerializerBinaryFormatter but I got different problemsp  ul liXML Serializer doesnt work with Interfaces IList. And I dont want the make a DTO for every entity class and use a mapper to saveload it. The mainenance of the unittest would be too big.li lipI use lazy loading, so I cant save it easy in the XMLBinary. I have the use eager loading and joinfetch every table. Also something like thisp  pcodeSimpleQueryltArtikelgt art  new SimpleQueryltArtikelgtfrom Order inner join fetch a.Article where a.Id  Idcodepli ul  pHere I have the problem, that I have to join every related table manually. The maintenance would be also too long.p  pNow Im looking for a easy way to createsaveload testdata for my unittests. At the moment der are over 600 Unittest, which load data from a testdatabase and change some rows. So we have the restore the testdatabase every time. I dont want the remove every unittest. I want that this unittests work with my testdata. I also want to create new unittests with new testdata.p  pDoes anyone has an idea how I can saveload my data in a xml file Or is there another better way the solve my problemp  pEdit I use Microsoft FakesShim, so the unittests dont access to the db. Now I want to get testdata from my FakesShim. I really want to remove the testdatabase from my unittests. There are different benefits for me. Im trying the resolve my problem with JSON, but it still doesnt work.p  pEdit2 Ok I probably have a workaround. First I use a JSON serializer and not a xml serializer. In this case I dont have a problem with my interfaces. I use the following solution for serialize my proxy objects  a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions286721jsonnetandnhibernatelazyloadingofcollectionsJSON.NET and nHibernate Lazy Loading of Collectionsa Now I only have the problem with lazy loading. At the moment I temporary change every lazy  true to lazy  false in this way I can serialize most objects and create my JSON files. It works in the most scenarios, but It loads too much data. Im looking for a property like Query.MaxDepth  5p

Negative 1011 pI am trying to make a reverse 4x3 tic tac toe game in c using a depth first search and minimax. I keep getting a segmentation fault whenever the tree is trying to get the minimax value and Im not sure why. Ive looked at my logic a bunch of times and I just cant seem to see the problem. I dont think it is creating the tree correctly somehow. p  pMy idea for depth first was that it would look at the parent node, if it didnt have all its children it would create the next child node, copy the parent board to the child board, then for each child in childNum array it would skip as many blank spaces as the number child it is, then put an X or an O accordingly on the board. Then if it was not an end state it would send that childnode to getMove Once it got to an end state, it would store that value in the parent node and send the parent node to getMove and work its way back up the tree.p  pCan anyone see what is causing this segmentation fault or any other errors I have in my code Here it isp  precodeinclude ltiostreamgt include ltfstreamgt include ltiomanipgt

Negative 1011 pChef wrote some text on a piece of paper and now he wants to know how many holes are in the text. What is a hole If you think of the paper as the plane and a letter as a curve on the plane, then each letter divides the plane into regions. For example letters A, D, O, P, R divide the plane into two regions so we say these letters each have one hole. Similarly, letter B has two holes and letters such as C, E, F, K have no holes. We say that the number of holes in the text is equal to the total number of holes in the letters of the text. Help Chef to determine how many holes are in the text. Inputp  pThe first line contains a single integer T lt 40, the number of test cases. T test cases follow. The only line of each test case contains a nonempty text composed only of uppercase letters of English alphabet. The length of the text is less then 100. There are no any spaces in the input. Outputp  pFor each test case, output a single line containing the number of holes in the corresponding text.

Using cbind in R works as expected for the data, but the column labels seem to get lost after the cbind operation the column labels become V1, V2, etc....  This would be part of a function and each matrix would be an input to the function so one or both of the matrices being appended would usually contain a different number of columns but always the same number of rows.p  pIs there a way to retain the column names when binding the two matrices using cbind, or is there an alternative way to append one matrix to the other that will retain the column labelsp  pThanks in advancep

Negative 1011 pBasically Im working on this beat detection algorithm, the strange thing i am encountering right now is that when i split the work load on to another thread. So now i have one main thread and another worker thread. My worker thread somehow is always working faster than the main thread. It seems strange because what i have learned is that the main thread should theoretically always be faster because it is not taking time to initialise the thread. However what i get is even i pass a extra 1024 samples to the worker thread they are both working with around 30 million samples currently it is still faster than the main thread.

After some debugging and trialanderror I figured out that the problem is caused for some reason by the initialization of codePyObject outarraycode in codengnetworks.hcode. Indeed when I create the codePyObjectcode in C code in codeweavecode it works perfectly that is I modify the codengnratebifsystemcode class member function so that it returns a codedoublecode and then I build the codePyObjectcode from the latter within the weave interfacep  precodeclass ngnrate    Model Class      ...     public         ...         double bifsystem   double ngnratebifsystem     long int NUMEL  NEQ  PyArray creation function requires long int      Does some operations on y,dy     ...      return dy  codepre  pAnd then in the codeweavecode interfacep  precodedef ngnratepy     supportcode                      include ltPython.hgt                    include ngnetworks.h                          code              Initialize Model             ngnrate network             Create temporary dy              double dy  network.bifsystem             Create PyObject            PyObject outarray  PyArraySimpleNew1, ampNUMEL, NPYDOUBLE            double dyaux  double PyArrayObject outarraygtdata             Assign dy to PyObject                        forint i0iltNUMELi dyaux[i]dy[i]             returnval  outarray codepre  pI cannot figure out why the above works whereas I get a segmentation fault if I make codePyObjectcode be returned by my class. Noteworthy is that in some other code I had just a staticnonmember Cfunction that returned a codePyObjectcode that when called from codeweavecode worked just fine. So my guess is that there are some issues with codePyObjectcode used within C class object. But I cannot figure out what. And although I can work with the above code creating the codePyObjectcode within the codeweavecode interface, for portability Id rather have it directly provided by my class codengnratecode.p  pThanks in advance for your feedback.p  pMp

Negative 1011 pI feel like I would benefit greatly from understanding the differences in how these functions work so that I could better understand when to use each one. p  pIm having a very difficult time working with two different interops Excel, and EPDM which have both made extensive use of weak typed parameters.  I keep running into problems using returned objects and casting them to the proper type per the documentation.  After wasting a ton of time, Ive found that using a hrefhttpsmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibrary5422sfdfvvs.90.aspx relnofollowTypeNamea, a hrefhttpsmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibrarys2wzt390.aspx relnofollowGetTypea, and a a hrefhttpsmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibrary0ec5kw18.aspx relnofollowTypeOf operatora with COM objects can yield different results, and in different circumstances each one can be more or less reliable than the next.  p  pNow, in most cases codeTypeNamecode seems to be the most reliable for determining type with COM objects.  However, avoiding the other two functions entirely seems quite cargo cultish to me, and besides that today I ran into an a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comq315185564106771interesting problema where I cant seem to cast an object to the type reported by codeTypeNamecode.   An interesting notion was brought up in the comments on that problem that objects which implement codeIDispatchcode may actually return the emdispatchedem interface typename, which could partially explain the differences.  p  pId really like to better understand how these functions actually work, but I get kind of lost running through the a hrefhttpreferencesource.microsoft.com relnofollow.NET ReferenceSourcea, so Im offering a bounty on this question in hopes someone can explain how these different functions work and in what context each should be used.  p  pHere is a code excerpt from working with the Excel interop. p  precodeDim DocProps As Object  DocProps  WeeklyReports.CustomDocumentProperties WeeklyReports is a Workbook object Debug.PrintDocProps Is Nothing Debug.PrintTypeNameDocProps Debug.PrintTypeOf DocProps Is DocumentProperties Debug.PrintDocProps.GetType.ToString codepre  pThe output is p  blockquote   pFalsebr   DocumentPropertiesbr   Falsebr   System.ComObjectp blockquote

Negative 1011 pIm building a web app tool that allows a user to do some actions using their GitHub account view their private repos, etc. Its built on ASP .NET MVC5 using the Octokit library for GitHub access. In version 0.0 of the tool the learnhowOAuthworks stage, the website follows the OAuth flow as detailed in a hrefhttphaacked.comarchive20140424octokitoauth relnofollowthis blog posta which has the user sign in to GitHub which then provides me with a token. I store the token in Session[OAuthToken], load all the data that it needs from GitHub, and then provide all the data to my view using a model.p  pNow that the data that needs to be loaded is growing in size and could start becoming more dynamic, Id like to switch this design to load the data after the page is provided to the user. The workflow would look a little bit likep  ol liUser is not logged into GitHub. App gives the user link to GitHub authentication pageli liAfter logging in, OAuthToken is saved and user gets redirected back to first pageli liNow that user is logged in, webpage provided to user is barebones HTML with JavaScript but no datali liJavaScript likely Angular makes asynchronous calls to the server WebApi requesting various pieces of datali liServer calls GitHub API for the requested data using the users OAuthToken and provides it back to the webpageli liJavaScript renders the datali ol  pWhat I dont understand about this workflow is how I can safely authenticate that the user is making valid calls to WebApi for the data. The server has a OAuthToken to use, but my understanding is that its unsafe to provide that to the user to use in its calls. However, without it, how can the WebApi endpoint tell that the request that its receiving should use this particular OAuthToken. p  pThe website doesnt have any other form of login, and Id love to keep it that way. But even if it did have its own login, I think I would still have the same problem. A logged in user accesses a page and subsequent JavaScript calls from the page need to be authenticated with some piece of information included in the request.p  pWhat are my options Can the JavaScript calls to WebApi be connected to whatever MVC uses to determine Session[OAuthToken] as that value seems to be persistent in subsequent page views Can I set the OAuthToken in a cookie and access it that way If it helps, the web app uses HTTPS everywhere, but Id also like to know if theres a solution that works without HTTPS.p  pThanks for your help.p

Negative 1011 pI am struggling to understand the different types of binding exchanges in RabbitMQ. Actually I want to implement a certain pattern, and also to understand which exchangebindingroutingkey combination fits this pattern. p  pI have the followings a producer which generates 3 types of messages, 3 consumers, one for each kind of message. Producer P generates A, B and C messages. Consumers receive the following messages ConsumerA only receives A messages, Consumer B only receives B messages, ConsumerC only receives C messages. This worked fine. p  pThen I added a 4th consumer, D, which is supposed to receive both B and C messages. When a B message is generated, both consumers B and D should receive it. Similarly, when a C message is produced, both C and D consumers should be notified. Instead of that, what actually happens is this  1. Message A always goes to consumer A only which is OK. 2. Message B goes alternatively to consumer B and D once only to B, once only to D, once only to B, once only to D and so on wrong 3. Message C goes alternatively to consumer C and D once only to C, once only to D, once only to C, once only to D and so on wrongp  pI did some reading and I understand this is the socalled roundrobin style dispatching, but this seems useless to me. I want to be able to propagate the same message to all the consumers that are interested in it. If there are 10 consumers interested in a messages, I dont want only one of them the receive a message and the others 9 of them know nothing about it, I want every time all 10 consumers to receive the same message.

Negative 1011 pIm trying to make a 360video player app for Android. So far Ive managed to create a sphere and project the video on to it. I also have an Arcball camera that follows the sphere in order to handle user touchevents and object rotations.p  pIve extended the codeArcballCameracode class from Rajawali to make some changes on it as I dont like some weird movements the video does when rotating the sphere. Ive managed to change vertical and horizontal rotating directions.br The problem is, if the user scrolls up and up, there is a moment when you pass the spheres pole where the video gets upside down. Also, depending on how the sphere rotates Im not sure of what is the reason exactly the video also is sloping.  I want to let the user to look up and down, behind and forward, but I always want the northern video pole to point up,  I dont know if Im explaining myself well.p  pI can only post two links, so here is a screenshot of the app  This happens either when the user continues scrolling up or down passing the spheres polesp  pa hrefhttpi.imgur.comy4ks6hY.png relnofollowupside down captureap  pI am using quaternions for the rotations and, since theyre made with a rotation axis and a rotation angle, I first tried to keep the xaxis or zaxis at 0, but that didnt work.

Negative 1011 pOpenGL says that if depth function is GLLESS and layout qualifier is depthless, then OpenGL will perform the early depth test.p  pNow if the original value in buffer is 0.5 and if the depth for particular pixel is 0.8, it will fail the early depth test.

Negative 1011 pI have succeeded to communicate a map contained in .svg file with the html file that contains it and these two entities can interchange, say, a string. The problem arises when I try to embed the map within the items of a menu in a navigation bar. Then, there is a run time error and the communication no longer takes place.p  pIll enclose first the html code that works and secondly the html code that doesnt work.

Negative 1011 pIs there a way when documentation popup on AS to not hide immediately after it is showed by moving mouse on some class. What I mean. I move mouse cursor above Activity class and documentation is popup is showed, but when I try to move mouse above this popup because I have to scroll it it dissapeares. I can hold ctrl and then is will not hide, but if I press on it while holdint ctrl down it will disappear so I should move cursor above it, release ctrl and after that to start scrolling. So is there an option to change this behaviour to be like in eclipse  documentation pop up is showed and if you move mouse above it you can scroll, otherwise it is closed.  Thanks in advance.p

Negative 1011 pGood day, everyone. We are using GraniteDS as a client development framework. With help of GraniteDS we are subscribing to JMS Topics, so our client will receive push notifications from server side. Currently, we are facing that GraniteDS causes High CPU Usage on our Production environment. Using JMC we see such a picturep  pa hrefhttpi.stack.imgur.comIL4nK.jpg relnofollowimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comIL4nK.jpg altenter image description hereap  pSo there are 5 threads which is default number and they are using more than 30 of CPU, sometimes this value might be increased up to 50. Also Allocated Bytes value is really high. Monitoring threads we see picture like this a hrefhttpi.stack.imgur.comqIoph.jpg relnofollowimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comqIoph.jpg altenter image description hereap  pAfter rebooting our servers problem will be reproduced after couple days. There are some JMS Connection leaks, but those unnecessary connections will be closed after 30 minutes channelidletimeoutmillis30 minutes.  1. There are not any high amount of JMS connections. 2. There is no high amount of JMS Messages.p  pSo have anyone faced similar issue with GraniteDS causing high CPU usage p

Negative 1011 pI am new using Orange using version 2.7  and I was wondering if someone can answer the following question How to relate not merge, not concatenate 2 datasets in Orange Thank you.
