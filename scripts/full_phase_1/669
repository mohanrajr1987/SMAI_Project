Positive 669 pIm completely new to Sharepoint so keep that in mind when answering or assuming things.p  pAnyways, we have a CRM 2015 Online Update 1 and Sharepoint Online and those are integrated not by me. Now when an enduser goes to Account  Documents the CRM will automatically ask if the user wants to create a folder to Sharepoint. Thats fine, but naming convention seems to be AccountNameAccountGuid. We would like to change that to AccountNameOurOwnID where OurOwnID is a custom field in CRM that is unique for every account.p  pSo my question is how would one do thisp  pEDIT All I can think of now is to create a plugin thatll be launched when ever a sharepointdocumentlocation entity is created and basically create a new folder with wanted name and then delete the original folder in Sharepoint and then connect the new folder with sharepointdocumentlocation.p  pSubquestion Is there a way to tell CRM to stop asking if the user wants to create a new folder In my case its unwanted feature but since it is there at least we should make sure that names of the folders will be ok.p
Positive 669 pI would first of all like to find out if anyone has successfully implemented this Code sample  SharePointtoLinkedIn connector on this a hrefhttpsmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibraryofficeff512786voffice.14.aspx relnofollowlinka. Kindly help out with details on how to get it to work. I am currently stuck with a file not found error message when I launch the URL after deploying the solution successfully from Visual Studio 2010 which refers to the DotNetOpenAuth library and therefore I am unable to see the LinkedIn optin page. I downloaded the code sample from the link and just edited the SharePoint server URL to my own.p  pPlease help. My client really wants this feature as part of their social media collaboration phase using SharePoint.p  pThanks.p

These are designed to be more standalone documents like an MS Word doc which happen to be written in HTML, rather than typical public webpages.p  pThe question I am grappling with is whether and how common cloud storage  collaboration  document management services Dropbox, Sharepoint  OneDrive, Google Drive etc. can and should be used to store these HTML files, particularly so that access control and sharing  collaboration features can be applied. p  hr  pMore infop  pIdeally, I want to understand to what extent each service can be used top  ul liStore the HTML, CSS and JS files they can all do this as youd expectli liBrowse and navigate the HTML pages in a browser as if they were any other websiteli liProvide access control i.e. using their sharing featuresli liProvide other document management features versioning, commenting etc.li liBasic editing without downloading, editing and reuploadingli ul  pWhat Ive found so far not being an expert in any of these servicesp  ol lipstrongDropboxstrongp  ul liThe Dropbox client on my Mac opens and renders the HTML in a browser as expected  li liBut on the web, Dropbox displays a preview of the unstyled HTML in an iFrameli liIt will render the HTML directly if it has a share link by manually editing the url to dl.dropboxusercontent.comemdocidememfile.htmlemli li... but it will not find the external files JS, CSS, images, etc. unless they have absolute URLs.li ulli lipstrongMS OneDrive  SharePointstrongp  ul liI have an Office 365 subscription, so have been playing around with it.li liAlthough I can upload all the files to various places document libraries, sites, folders, etc., the HTML downloads when clicked on instead of being rendered in a browser.li liSimilar question here a hrefhttpsharepoint.stackexchange.comquestions123213newpagewithcustomhtmlcontenthttpsharepoint.stackexchange.comquestions123213newpagewithcustomhtmlcontenta.li liIt might be possible, but I might need to learn SharePoint.li ulli lipstrongGoogle Drivestrongp  ul liPeople with access rights to the HTML can render it in a browser via a URL like www.googledrive.comhostemdocidemli liThis hosting service is being deprecated from 2016. a hrefhttpgoogleappsupdates.blogspot.co.uk201508deprecatingwebhostingsupportin.html relnofollowLinkali ulli ol  pSo, to summarise, my questionp  ul liAre there any cloud services that can be used with standalone HTMLCSSJS documents just as they can with other documents .docx, .pptx, etc., and give a good user experienceli ul  pAt the moment, my research suggests not  the user experience is too clunky, and so I may need to host the HTML documents on web servers somewhere, and implement my own access control amp doc management solution.p  pIf anyone has any other suggestions  solutions for implementing access control  doc management for HTML pages, please let me know.p

These work fine to set the property values when using simple term sets, but not as well if the term set has a hierarchical structure.p  pIn my specific example were setting a users location, and the term set has a hierarchical structure of p  blockquote   pCountry  Cityp blockquote  pSo every City is a child of a Country. Assuming the terms already exist in the term set you can simply pass in the name of a City and it will find that nested term and use it, no problem. But consider the case when we have both Paris, France and Paris, USA in the term set. Passing in the string Paris will set the property to the first Paris it finds Paris, France, but how can I set the value to be Paris, USA insteadp  pI tried passing in iUSAParisi, which resulted in a new term named that. I also tried passing in iParisGUIDOFTERMi but that fails saying  is an illegal character.p  pDoes anyone have a way to specify a specific nested term when setting a profile property using CSOMp

Negative 669 pI am having a similar issue to a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions28387sqlserver2k5memoryconsumptionthis persona.  The primary difference being the application is NOT meant for a developer environment, and therefore I need to know how to optimize the space used by Sql Server possibly per machine based on specs.p  pI was intrigued by a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comusers10795ricardocRicardo Csa answer, particularly the followingp  blockquote   pExtracted fromt he SQL Server   documentationp      pMaximum server memory in MBp      pSpecifies the maximum amount of memory SQL Server can allocate when it   starts and while it runs. This   configuration option can be set to a   specific value if you know there are   multiple applications running at the   same time as SQL Server and you want   to guarantee that these applications   have sufficient memory to run. If   these other applications, such as Web   or email servers, request memory only   as needed, then do not set the option,   because SQL Server will release memory   to them as needed. strongHowever,   applications often use whatever memory   is available when they start and do   not request more if neededstrong. If an   application that behaves in this   manner runs on the same computer at   the same time as SQL Server, set the   option to a value that guarantees that   the memory required by the application   is not allocated by SQL Server.p blockquote  pMy question is how does an application request memory from the OS when it needs it  Is this something built into compilation or something managed by the developer  The two primary apps running on this machine are Sql Server and the fairly heavyweight C application Im developing, and Im almost certain we didnt specifically do anything in the realm of asking the OS for memory.

Negative 669 pIm having trouble understanding conceptually what I should do while trying to make my first large javascript web application.p  pDepending on which tab a user has selected, I show different content inside a container.  The content is more than just text and uses different javascript functions and events.  I am using the Yahoo UI Librarys TabView implementation, but the way that this issue should be handled would probably apply to other Tab approaches.p  pWhat I was thinking of doing was basically the followingp  pCreate separate modules for each tab e.g. MYAPP.modules.tabCalendar and MYAPP.modules.tabJournal.  When the user clicks on a different tab or navigates with browser buttons to a previous tab state, I could call MYAPP.modules[oldModule].disable and MYAPP.modules[newModules].enable.  These functions would subscribe or unsubscribe their custom events for example, a general click handler attached to the container.p  pAn alternate approach to dealing with events might be to have a single global click handler.  If the click is inside the container, then determine which tab is currently selected and send the click event to MYAPP.modules[currentTab].onClick.  p  pOr, the global click handler could fire a Custom Event to which the modules have subscribed since page load, and each modules onClick events will run and determine whether or not they should do anything.p  pThere seem to be a lot of options, but Ive been having trouble finding resources that talk about the best ways to do things like this.  Am I on the right path  How should I handle thisp

Negative 669 pIm in the process of porting a large C application from Linux gcc to Windows Visual C 2008 and am having linker issues with plugins. On Linux this wasnt an issue, as .so supports runtime symbol lookup, but dll does not seem to support this.p  pSome background information The application the host, which hosts a scripting environment, provides interfaces to plugins shared libraries that are loaded at runtime by script API calls, allowing the host and the scripting API to be extended without recompiling the host application. On Linux this is just a matter of including the host applications headers in the plugin source, but on Windows Im receiving linker errors. Im not sure exactly what I need to link with for Visual C to resolve these symbols.p  pOne of our dependencies open source, LGPL has preprocessor declarations that it uses to insert declspecdllexport and declspecdllimport into its headers. Some prior research indicates that I may have to do this as well, but Id like to be sure before I go modifying a whole bunch of core headers. I was previously able to get this working on MinGW, but weve decided that supporting Visual Studio is a requirement for this sort of commercial project.p  pMy question, in a nutshell strongHow do I link runtimeloaded dlls against a host exe in Visual Cstrongp  pEdit To clarify the problem with an example, I have a class in my host application, strongObjectstrong, which represents the base type of an object that may be accessed by a script. In my plugins I have a number of classes which extend strongObjectstrong to perform other functions, such as integrating networking support or new visual elements. This means that my dll must link with symbols in the host exe, and I am not sure how to do that.p

Negative 669 pI am in need of an application that can periodically transmit select rows from a PostgreSQL database across a network to a second PostgreSQL server.  Typically these will be the most recent row added, pulled and transmitted every 1030 seconds.p  pThe primary servers run in a MS Windows environment with a highlatency, and occasionally intermittent, network connection.  Therefore, any application would have to be tolerant of this and ideally automatically reconnect  resend data that could not be transmitted.  Due to the environment and the requirements, a fullblown replication package would be unnecessary.p  pI appreciate any help anyone has with this problem.p
Negative 669 pSo I want to be able to just log all unhandled exceptions to the event log without having to catch all the exceptions manually and write them out.p  pI wanted to use the health monitoring functionality within a WCF service, the problem is that this only catches errors generated by asp.net and I specifically want to also catch SPException errors thrown from calling into SharePoint. p  pIt seems that exceptions are only handled if they call the raise method on the WebBaseErrorEvent in the System.Management namespace, I assume ASP.Net exceptions do this inherently but SPExceptions do not. So my only option is the manually catch SPException errors and write them out to the event log or create a new WebBaseErrorEvent object and call raise on it which defeats what I want to achieve.p  pAm I missing something is there an easier way p

Negative 669 pI have a .Net service that uses SENS to detect when a user logs on or off. Im having two problems, thoughp  ol liEven though the service seems to be starting automatically, if there is only one user on the computer and that user doesnt have a password meaning windows will start right away, the login doesnt seem to be getting detected. Is it possible that the service is getting started too late If so, what are my optionsli liI dont seem to have a way to detect windows switches users. In other words, if I log in with person A, I can detect that. If I then switch users meaning person A doesnt log out to person B, person B logs in and I detect that. But if I switch back to person A, no logon has taken place, and I dont know that the switch took place. Is there a way, via SENS, to catch these events. I seem to only be able to catch Display locksunlocks, logging onoff, when the screensaver startsstops, and when the shell starts. Is it possible to do more with SENS, or perhaps to detect when the user is switched using these operations Or perhaps by some other techniqueli ol

Negative 669 pGdayp  pI think I have a misunderstanding of serializable.

Negative 669 pI am developing an asp.net mvc 2 web application. My clients will most likely want a copy of my application to be hosted on their servers instead of me hosting it on my server for all clients.p  pHowever I see a problem with this because I was planning to use the .net 2.0 encryptor to encrypt my web.config to make it safer.  I got to thinking well I am only going to give them my .dll and views and etc their not going to get the soultion of my file so they can load it up and have a look at what is going on.p  pSo what happens if I encrypt the web.config and all of a sudden the database connect string changes Let it be the address changes or the username password changes.p  pHow would they change it if it is encrypted Would that mean I would have to rebuild my site and send them a new copy with the changes Or is their a different wayp  pIf there is no other way it got me thinking should I What happens if some thing happens and for whatever reason I cant get the new changes to them until 48 hours later. That means they cant use the service for 48 hours.  p  pI have no problem providing support but when it starts coming to little things that they probably should have control to change in the first place they probably should.p  pI would prefer to have it encrypted but at the same time if I have to make all changes to the web.config that is not good either. Since it could open up different security concerns as they have to get the changes to me some how.p

Negative 669 pI am a little perplexed by the mysqli interface in PHP.

Negative 669 pWhats the use of the binding information field when adding a new net.pipe binding in IIS Ive been told to enter a  in it, but I want to know what its used for.p
Negative 669 pI want to bind the scale of a codeCAConstraintcode so that a codeCALayercodes width with respect to its superlayer can indicate progress of a codeQTMoviecode based on a variable that I am updating in a scheduled timer method that fires every second. The width of the codeCALayercode should be 0.0f when progress is zero and 100 the width of the superlayer when progress is complete i.e. codecurrentProgress  1.0fcode. The way that I have created the layer with the constraint is as follows p  precodeself.progressLayer  [[[CALayer alloc] init] autorelease]  progressLayer.name  progressLayer progressLayer.backgroundColor  [Utilities blackColour]  [progressLayer addConstraint[CAConstraint constraintWithAttributekCAConstraintMinX relativeTosuperlayer attributekCAConstraintMinX]] [progressLayer addConstraint[CAConstraint constraintWithAttributekCAConstraintHeight relativeTosuperlayer attributekCAConstraintHeight]] [progressLayer addConstraint[CAConstraint constraintWithAttributekCAConstraintMidY relativeTosuperlayer attributekCAConstraintMidY]] CAConstraint constraint  [CAConstraint constraintWithAttributekCAConstraintWidth relativeTosuperlayer attributekCAConstraintWidth scale0.0f offset0.0f] [constraint bindscale toObject[MediaPlayer sharedMediaPlayer] withKeyPathcurrentProgress optionsnil] [progressLayer addConstraintconstraint] codepre  pThe problem that I have is that when I update the codecurrentProgresscode variable in my method that is fired every second, the codeCALayercode doesnt update its width at all. To start with testing my code I am just incrementing the progress value by code0.01fcode and I am logging the amount and it is definitely updating. However, when I update the amount based on a button click, the layer updates correctly. p  pJust for good measure this is how I am updating the variable in my codeNSTimercode method within my codeMediaPlayercode classp  precode void checkProgressNSTimertimer      self.currentProgress  0.01f     NSLogcheckProgress f, currentProgress  codepre  pAnd on a button press I update it like so p  precodeself.currentProgress  0.1f codepre  pWhy isnt the width of the layer updating based on the changes in my method but updates on the button press Does anyone have any ideas for me to follow to try and figure this outp  pThanksp

Negative 669 pLeopard 10.5.8, XCode 3.1.1 using runModalForWindow to implement what is intended to be a high performance mouse tracking mechanism where I have to do realtime complex bitmap modifications.p  pThe modal loop runs, the timer fires, the mouse tracks... but the performance is abysmal, and it gets worse and worse the longer the runloop goes on. Instead of catching mouse messages every pixel or so, I get them every 5... 10.... 20 seconds.p  pInstruments shows that the majority of the time during this growing response bottleneck is being spent in machmsgtrap and yes, I have the perspective set to the running app, so the impression I am under is that it thinks it doesnt have any work to do, despite the fact that Im dragging the mouse around with the button held down like a crazy person. There are no memory leaks showing up, and in my 8core 2.8 GHZ machine, theres almost no CPU activity going on.p  pAgain, the app is not spending much time in my code... so its not a performance problem of mine. Ive probably configured something wrong, or failed to configure it at all, or am simply approaching the whole idea wrong  but I sure would appreciate some insight here. As it stands now, the dispatch of mouse messages and timer messages is absolutely unacceptable. You couldnt implement a crayon drawing program for someone immersed in cold molasses with the response times Im getting.p  pEDIT Some additional info doesnt happen on my 10.5.8 macbook pro. Just the 8core, 6display Mac Pro. I tried taking the display code for the croprect in drawrect out, replaced it with an NSLog... still drags on issuing mouse updates. Also tried rebooting and running without the usual complement of apps running. And with mirrored displays. No difference.p  pImagine dragging a brush across the screen at first, is paints smoothly, then gaps appear between brush placements, then they get larger, and this goes on until youre only getting one brush placement every 10 seconds. Thats how this acts. Using NSlog and various other tracking methods, Ive determined that it is at least at the highest level occurring because the mouseDragged events slow down to a trickle. The question in a nutshell is, why would that happenp  pAnyonep

I have been googling around for a while and I believe that this slow down has something to do with the memory bandwidth, memory allocation or caching, given the large datasets, but I am not very sure about what is really happening behind and how could I improve the performance.  I have run the code on both a small intel atom , 2GB ram and a 4 core intel xeon, with 8GB of course with a correspondingly scaled dataset and the slow down behavior is the same.  p  pI just need to understand why is it that this slow down happens  would it do any good if i implement the function in C  or try to implement it to run on a GPU   Any other ideas how to improve it   Thanks in advancep

Negative 669 pTo make a long story short I have developed an application for a company and I was about to update when I discovered that in the member center area on the Apple website the Development Certificate was gone, as well as the devices and other stuff, so I made a new one and uploaded the device ID again. p  pSo everything okay...I thought. I opened iTunes and downloaded the new provisioning profile and dragged it over to the organizer window. But it did not work. I got several different warning and errors saying the the keys, certificates etc did not match, so I Googled. I saw some posts that said try making a new distrubution certificate...so I did, then xcode told me that I had to many certificates for that app so I exported the certificates by right clicking the selected certificates in the keychain and tapped export. I ended up with a Certificates.cer file. Then I deleted those certificates to make room for the new ones i downloaded from the member center portal.p  pSO now I do not know what I have done...I am afraid that I screwed something really up.p  pMy question is I really hope it is still possible to update the application already in appstore even though I have to recreate the certficates, provisioning profiles etc.p  pBest regardsp

Negative 669 h1Questionh1  pIn Haskell, the codebasecode libraries and Hackage packages provide several means of converting binary IEEE754 floating point data to and from the lifted codeFloatcode and codeDoublecode types. However, the accuracy, performance, and portability of these methods are unclear.p  pFor a GHCtargeted library intended to deserialize a binary format across platforms, what is the best approach for handling IEEE754 floating point datap  h1Approachesh1  pThese are the methods Ive encountered in existing libraries and online resources.p  h2FFI Marshalingh2  pThis is the approach used by the a hrefhttphackage.haskell.orgpackagedatabinaryieee754codedatabinaryieee754codea package. Since codeFloatcode, codeDoublecode, codeWord32code and codeWord64code are each instances of codeStorablecode, one can codepokecode a value of the source type into an external buffer, and then codepeekcode a value of the target typep  precodetoFloat  F.Storable word, F.Storable float gt word gt float toFloat word  F.unsafePerformIO  F.alloca  buf gt do     F.poke F.castPtr buf word     F.peek buf codepre  pOn my machine this works, but I cringe to see allocation being performed just to accomplish the coercion. Also, although not unique to this solution, theres an implicit assumption here that IEEE754 is actually the inmemory representation. The tests accompanying the package give it the works on my machine seal of approval, but this is not ideal.p  h2codeunsafeCoercecodeh2  pWith the same implicit assumption of inmemory IEEE754 representation, the following code gets the works on my machine seal as wellp  precodetoFloat  Word32 gt Float toFloat  unsafeCoerce codepre  pThis has the benefit of not performing explicit allocation like the approach above, but the a hrefhttpwww.haskell.orgghcdocslatesthtmllibrariesbaseUnsafeCoerce.htmldocumentationa says it is your responsibility to ensure that the old and new types have identical internal representations.

Its nice to bypass the lifted types, but thats about all that can be said.p  h2codeencodeFloatcode and codedecodeFloatcodeh2  pThis approach has the nice property of bypassing anything with codeunsafecode in the name, but doesnt seem to get IEEE754 quite right.

Negative 669 pThe following scenario is, I would say quite common and although I know one way of resolving it but it lack elegance. p  pThe example Im giving is based upon a hrefhttpsgithub.comsharparchitectureSharpArchitectureCookbook relnofollowhttpsgithub.comsharparchitectureSharpArchitectureCookbooka. p  pThe application Im coding is an ASP.NET MVC application and has to support multiple users working on the same object. p  pThe following scenario is an edge case but nevertheless a valid one. p  pSay you have two users working on the same object and whether the dB row can be updated depends upon the value of a particular field. To make it more concrete, lets say you have a Product and to keep things simple, this Product has Name and QuantityInStock fields. p  pSay that initially, there are 10 items of the Product and User1 and User2 want to buy this product. When both users are presented the initial form they are told that there are 10 of these items in stock. Now User1 buys all 10 items while User2 goes to have a coffee. So User1s transaction goes through no problem. p  pThen User2 comes back after his coffee in the belief that there are still 10 items in stock. So he tries to buy 1 but he must be prevented from doing so since there are no items in stock. p  pSo this problem can be solved by using ASP.NET DataAnnotations validation and this will catch the majority of cases. However, in our edge case, say that User1 and User2 perform the same operation but within a fraction of a second such that when User2 submits the form, it passes the ASP.NET Validation but by the time it gets to the persistence layer, the QuantityInStock is 0. p  pThe solution to this is to perform the validation at the latest moment as possible i.e. just before calling the Update method. p  pNow for some code. p  precodepublic ProductModel CreateOrUpdateProductModel productModel      var currentProductModel  GetproductModel.Id      var currentQuantityInStock  currentProductModel.QuantityInStock       ifcurrentProductModel.QuantityInStock 0 ampamp productModel.QuantityInStock gt currentQuantityInStock               currentProductModel.QuantityInStock productModel.QuantityInStock         currentProductModel.Name  productModel.Name          this.productModelRepository.SaveOrUpdate currentProductModel          return productModel          else              Raise an exception       codepre  pNow, the fact that Im callingp  precode var currentProductModel  GetproductModel.Id codepre  pmeans that if I were to just do thisp  precode this.productModelRepository.SaveOrUpdate productModel  codepre  pwould cause an exceptionp  blockquote   pa different object with the same identifier value was already associated with the session 1p blockquote  pHence, I have to copy all of the values from productModel to currentProductModel. Its fine when using something like Automapper but still kind of feels wrong to me in the sense that I feel I should just be able to save productModel as is without having to transfer the data from one object to another. p  pMoreover, having to do the same validation twice, once using DataAnnotation and another time just before updating violates the DRY principle. p  pThe point is that I feel like Im missing a trick but dont quite know where to start and what to investigate. p  pThis to me is a simple problem but coming up with a nice elegant solution is something else. So the question is how have you dealt with this simple case in the past Am I overthinking thisp

This means that there are bugs, improvements, and new features as issue types by default, apart from the tasks.  p  pFurthermore, I am adding a continous integration tool in this configuration, and assume that it is bamboobtw, I never used bamboo before, I used Hudson, and I am using Eclipse IDE with mylyn plugin and plus the project is a maven projectweb.  p  pNow, I want to elucidate what I want to do by illustrating following scenario. AnalystA opens a issueI, which is a new feature, related to maven projectP. As a developerD, I receive an email about the issue, and I open the task via Mylyn interface in Eclipse. I understand and develop the new feature related to issueI. Consider, I am a Test Driven Development oriented developer, thus I wrote the Unit, DBUnit and UserAcceptancefor example using selenium tests correspondingly. Finally, I commit the changes to the source control. I think the rest should be cycled automatically but I dont know how can I achive this The autocycled part is the following  p  pThe Source Control System should have a posthook script that triggers the Continous integration tool to build the projectP. While building, in the proper phase the test code should be run, and their reports generated. The useracceptance test should be performed in a dedicated serverFor example, jboss, or tomcat. The order of this acceptance test should be, up the server, run the UA test, then generate the UA test reports and down the server. If all these steps have been successfuly completed, the versioning shold be performed. In versioning part, the maven plugin or what so ever, should take the number of issues solved from the Issue Tracking System, and increment the related version fragmentsminor and revision, at last appends the build number. The fragments of the version may be saved in manifest file in order to show it in User Interface. Last but not the least, the CI tool should deploy it in Test environment. Thats all autocycled processes I want. p  pemOne more minor questionem the deployment of the artifact to the production environment should be done automatically or manually, what is the best practicep  pAny help  recommendation will be greatly appreaciated. Thank you very much.p
Negative 669 pI was hoping to make an app which dimmed the soft buttons to dots on the Galaxy Nexus, using the code from a hrefhttpstackoverflow.coma8602997183929this answera. For completeness, this is the codep  precodegetWindow.getDecorView.setSystemUiVisibilityView.SYSTEMUIFLAGLOWPROFILE codepre  pHeres the question, is it possible for the app to make this setting systemwide rather than just while the app has focus So ideally the app would run in the background and would keep View.SYSTEMUIFLAGLOWPROFILE as the default as long as its running, for any and every app that you open unless that app specifically overrides it, I suppose. Is this possible or does this fall outside the realm of what an Android app has permission to dop  pA sample use case is this I use the Screen Filter app to reduce brightness a lot for nighttime ebook reading or misc app usage, but the soft buttons are still very bright and distracting, so I wanted to make an app that would dim the soft buttons systemwide while running like how Screen Brightness reduces screen brightness systemwide while running so this wouldnt be a problem.p

Negative 669 pWe have a very complex Oracle package here over 4,100 lines of code thats giving us issues.  Ive been tasked to track down the problem.  The issue is, when we call the codeexecutefiltercode procedure, we expect to get back 6 tables.  However, around 1015 times a day our code crashes because table index 1 is out of range.  When this repros, it seems to repro several times then a minute later, it works great again.  Ive still yet to be able to repro this under a debugger to see exactly what the data set is  but I have a theory the dataset is just a single empty table.p  pDigging through the Oracle package is almost impossible, as its all one big runon query with no formatting, no indention, and pages and pages of code that builds other queries by concatenating strings and what not.  However, I have a theory about whats going on.p  pThe codeexecutefiltercode method calls one or more of dozens of other methods, for example codefilterbyareasnamecode.  Each of these methods queries some data and inserts this data into a table called codetpmtempfilterprojectcode.  An example of this isp  precodeFOR I IN 1..areaState.COUNT LOOP    INSERT INTO tpmtempfilterproject           projectid,       versionid        SELECT .. Grabs the data it needs from other tables codepre  pAt the end of each of these filter calls, we call a procedure called codepopulateresulttablecode which copies stuff in codetpmtempfilterprojectcode into another table and then doesp  precodeEXECUTE IMMEDIATE truncate table tpmtempfilterproject codepre  pSo, my theory is that if two people run this query at the same time, the rows from these holder tables are getting truncated prematurely while another query still needs them.p  pWhats the best way to prevent this sort of thing from happening  One idea I had would be to putp  precodeLOCK TABLE tpmtempfilterproject IN EXCLUSIVE MODE codepre  pAt the very beginning of codeexecutefiltercode, and a codeCOMMITcode as the very last line.  In theory, this should only allow one person to run the command at the same time, and pending requests will block until the first filter is done.  I havent tried this yet, but I have a few questions.p  ol liIs this a good theory as to whats going onli liIs this a good fix, or is there a better solution to this issueli ol  pI appreciate any insight into this problem.p  pstrongUPDATEstrongp  pHeres the schema for the temp tablep  precodeCREATE GLOBAL TEMPORARY TABLE TPMDBO.TPMTEMPFILTERPROJECT        PROJECTID   NUMBER NULL,     VERSIONID   NUMBER NULL       ON COMMIT DELETE ROWS codepre  pstrongANOTHER UPDATEstrongp  pThis does NOT appear to be a conflict between two sessions.  If I changep  precodeEXECUTE IMMEDIATE truncate table tpmtempfilterproject codepre  ptop  precodeDELETE tpmtempfilterproject codepre  pthen the error still occurs.  Even if I comment out that line completely, the error still eventually occurs.  There is nothing else in that package body that deletes, truncates, or modifies any other data what so ever.p  pSecond piece of evidence  I finally did repro the error under the Visual Studio debugger.  The DataSet in .NET is completely empty.  Theres one table called emtableem that has zero columns.  If this was an issue with one session deleting data in these temp tables, then I would expect a valid schema with zero rows or perhaps rows from the wrong session.p

Negative 669 pIf I were writing a Python function which received an argument with the correct type, but a value out of bounds, then I might throw a ValueError or one of its subclasses.p  pFor example, suppose I had a function which added up the prices on an invoice. If one of the prices had a negative value or one of the itemcounts was not positive and nonzero I might raise VE.p  pMy current project is in Java, but the situation is the samep  pA pricing function accepts only numbers within a specific range  whats the most sensible kind of exception object to throw that tells another Java developer their input is out of that sensible rangep

Negative 669 pI am creating an android game where enemies are generated randomly and there can be multiple at once.p  pIs it better to create the enemies at a random time from a timer so 5s, then 4s, then 6s... etc, or through the game loop count to 50, create enemy, count to 64, create enemy.p  pIf the phone the person used was slow at rendering the game loop, the timer could create too many enemies, but if it used the game loop, they would not get enemies very quickly. There appear to be pros and cons for each.p  pAlso, which is better for saving processing power so it can render images fasterp  pThanks in advancep  pTomp  pALSO, if I used a timer for each group of enemies, there would be 3 timers running.p

Negative 669 pIm working on a storyboardbased project for ios5, and it is working well so far, but I want to save the users state when they exit so that when they return to the app, I can jump them back to the place in the storyboard where they were when they left.p  pMy understanding is that as you navigate through a storyboard, it creates a stack of UIViewControllers, so that when you dismiss the current controller, it knows which one to display.  But if I jump to one of the UIViewControllers in a storyboard programmatically when the app starts up, it would not have that history, that stack of controllers, to backtrack along.  If nothing else, if two controllers segue into the same controller at some point in the storyboard, it wouldnt know which to go back to.p  pWhat is the proper way of dealing with this  Do I just go through the storyboard to the point where the user left off, presenting each UIViewController with animations set to NO until I get to the one that the user was on  And if so, whats the best way to store that information  Are there any methodsclasses that can assist with this, or am I rolling my own way of storing their through the storyboardp

Negative 669 pIm refactoring an application thats already in the app store. p  pIn this app, I have a UITabBar with two tabs. Each tab contains a tableview with a list of Customers and Inventory respectively. The tableview is backed by core data and I have methods in place to swipe the table view to change the sorting of the data.p  pThese two controllers are just the same bar the names of the entities I pass into the NSFetchedResultsController. My aim was to create a super class that would be a template of these two views as we reuse these views in other apps so we can rapidly prototype future projects.p  pHowever, my attempts have failed. I know the problem lies in the NSFetchedResultsController, but I just dont know why. When I try to run the app it fires the error p  precodeTerminating app due to uncaught exception NSInvalidArgumentException, reason  [NSArrayM insertObjectatIndex] object cannot be nil codepre  pHeres my code for the super class and one of the view controllers.

Negative 669 pWe have a large number of websites 50 which we wish to track using analytics software. We also wish to track the total number of visits across all sites from one console.p  pI have done some research, and the supported way to do this by google is to install one msater tracking profile, and use filters to create child profiles on each domain. However, this does not allow more than 49 different sites to be created due to the 50 site maximum, which means that having about 300 sites would result in 6 master profiles, which then need to be manually combined.p  pI have also tried multiple profiles per site using custom variables, e.g.p  precodevar gaq  gaq  [] gaq.push[t1.setAccount, UAxxx01] gaq.push[t1.setAllowLinker, true] gaq.push[t1.trackPageview]  var gaq  gaq  [] gaq.push[t2.setAccount, UAxxx02] gaq.push[t2.setAllowLinker, true] gaq.push[t2.trackPageview] codepre  pHowever I read that this may result in the data not properly being recorded, and seems to be strongly disproved of by Google. p  pIs there a simple way to combine multiple profiles If possible, id rather stick with Google, and were under a tight budget so cant afford the google analytics tools available.p

Negative 669 pi am trying to figure the best way to go about getting the number of retweets for a given tweet and likewise the number of comments for a specific facebook post. p  pI know there are api calls to retrieve these things individually using their respective apis however my question is how to achieve this on different platforms. p  pFor example lets say i have both a web app and iOS app that i would like my users to be able to share images from to either facebook or twitter. I have used something like ShareKit on iOS to share the images and i could probably tweak it to capture the id for the tweetpost which i could then send back to the web app to store in  a db. p  pQuestion is then how do i go about getting the number of retweetslikes for these tweets and posts Issue being that is that as far as i understand these are authenticated calls and i wouldnt have the proper authentication to get that info from facebooktwitter as the user would only have authorized my iOS app and not the web app Is there a way for me to pass on the user authentication to my server from the iOS and then use that when making the calls to get the number of retweetslikes p  pAny ideasp  pThxp

Negative 669 pWhen I make codeMenuItemcode in WPF that has a list of codeMenuItemcodes nested inside it throws the alignment off of the parent.

Negative 669 pstrongThe Projectstrongp  pI am working on a texture tracking project for mobile.  It exclusively tracks planar surfaces so I have been using openCVs cvFindHomography to calculate the homography between two frames.  That function runs very very slow however and is the primary bottleneck in my pipeline.  I decided that an algorithm that can take an initial estimate of the homography would run much faster because my change in homography between frames is very small.  Also, my outlier percentage is very small so robust methods are optional.  Unfortunately, to my knowledge open CV does not include a homography finder that takes an initial estimate.  It does however include solvePnP which takes the original 3d world coordinates of the scene, the current 2d image coordinates, a camera matrix, distortion parameters, and most importantly an initial estimate.  I am trying to replace FindHomography with solvePnP.  Since I use only 2d coordinates throughout the pipeline and solvePnP asks for 3d coordinates I am trying to move from 2d3d3dtransform2dtransform.  Right now that process runs 6x faster than FindHomography if it is given a good initial guess but it has issues.p  pstrongThe Problemstrongp  pSomething is wrong with how I am converting.  My theory was that since a camera matrix is not required to find a homography it should not be required for this process since I only want the information contained in a homography in the end.  I also assumed that since I throw out all z information in the end how I initialize z should not matter.  My process is as followsp  pFirst I convert all my initial 2d coordinates to 3d by giving them a z pos of 1.  I can assume that my original coordinates lie flat in the xy plane.  Thenp  precodecvMat rotmat 3x3 rotation matrix cvMat pnprot 3x1 rotation vector cvMat pnptran 3x1 translation vector cvMatx33f cameramatrix1,0,0,                           0,1,0,                           0,0,1 cvMatx41f dist0,0,0,0 cvsolvePnPoriginalcord, currentcord, cameramatrix, dist, pnprot, pnptran,true  Rodrigues converts from a rotation vector to a rotation matrix cvRodriguespnprot, rotmat cvMatx33f homographyrotmat0,0,rotmat0,1,pnptran0,                        rotmat1,0,rotmat1,1,pnptran1,                        rotmat2,0,rotmat2,1,pnptran21 codepre  pThe conversion to a homography here is simple.  The first two columns of the homography are from the 3x3 rotation matrix, the last column is the translation vector.  The one trick is that homography2,2 corresponds to scale while pnptran2 corresponds to movement in the z axis.  Given that I initialize my z coordinates to 1, scale is ztranslation  1.  This process works perfectly for 4 of 6 degrees of freedom.  Translationx, translationx, scale, and rotation about z all work.  Rotation about x and y however display significant error.  I believe that this is due to initializing my points at z  1 but I dont know how to fix it.p  pstrongThe Questionstrongp  pWas my assumption that I can get good results from solvePnP by using a faked camera matrix and initial z coord correct  If so, how should I set up my camera matrix and z coordinates to make x and y rotation work  Also if anyone knows where I could get a homography finding algorithm that takes an initial guess and works only in 2d, or information on techniques for writing my own it would be very helpful.  I will most likely be moving in that direction once I get this working.p  pstrongUpdatestrongp  pI built myself a test program which takes a homography, generates a set of coplanar points from that homography, and then runs the points through solvePnP to recover the specified homography. In the process of doing this I realized that I am fundamentally misunderstanding some part of how homographies are constructed.  I have been assuming that a homography is constructed as follows.p  precodehom0,2  x translation hom1,2  y translation hom2,2  scale, I can divide the entire matrix by this to normalize codepre  pthe first two columns I assumed were the first two columns of a 3x3 rotation matrix.  This essentially amounts to taking a 3x4 transform and throwing away column2.  I have discovered however that this is not true.  The test case showing me the error of my ways was trying to make a homography which rotates points some small angle around the y axis.p  precoderotate by .0175 rad about y axis rotmat  1,0,.0174,            0,1,0,       .0174,0,1 my conversion method to make this a homography gives  homography  1,0,0,               0,1,0,          .0174,0,1 codepre  pThe above homography does not work at all.  Take for example a point x,y,1 where x  58.  The result will be x,y,somenegativenumber.  When I convert from homogeneous coordinates back to cartesian my x and y values will both flip signs.  p  pAll that is to say, I now have a much simpler question that I think would let me solve everything.  How do I construct a homography that rotates points by some angle around the x and y axisp

Negative 669 pI am trying to reclass a raster file representing vegetation and land cover types using values stored in a SQL Server Express table. I have a set of 400 species records in the table, with each row representing a different species, and a column for each vegetation type.

The vegetation raster will then be reclassified to two values, 1 or 0, based on the values associated with the species record this will be slightly different for each species.p  pIn PythonWin, Im using pyodbc to connect to the SQL Server Express database table, then executing a select query statement to collect the values for a species record row into the pyodbc cursor.

Negative 669 pIm not positive, but I think this is an MVC routing problem. I still dont fully understand how routing works in MVC.p  pLets say I have several action methods that Ive applied a custom filter attribute top  precode[MyAttribute] public ActionResult Method1      ...       [MyAttribute] public ActionResult Method2      ...  codepre  pThese methods normally dont accept any parameters. Unfortunately the requirements have changed and now all of these methods might be receiving an optional parameter called MyParameter. If the parameter is passed in then a property in the ViewBag will be set.p  pIn the actual project, there are 70 of these methods. I was hoping to do it via the MyAttribute filter, because it already exists. So I would add something like this to the MyAttribute filterp  precodepublic class MyAttribute  ActionFilterAttribute      public override void OnActionExecutingActionExecutingContext filterContext              base.OnActionExecutingfilterContext              ...  other existing code           If a certain parameter was passed, I want to set a ViewBag property.         if filterContext.ActionParamenters.ContainsKeyMyParameter              filterContext.Controller.ViewBag.MyProperty  filterContext.ActionParamenters[MyParameter]       codepre  pBut unless the methods definition has MyParameter in it as a parameter, it doesnt see it in the ActionParameters collection. This is what makes me think it is a routing issue.p  pI would really prefer to not need to add the argument to all of the methods, but if theres no other way to then I can. Any suggestions or ideas would be appreciated.p

I have two specific questions.p  pQuestion 1 is how can I specify the coordinates of the positions inside the box, can I use JavaScript or image maps to do thisp  pQuestion 2 is how do I define the positions, for example where should Superior begin and where should it end This may be a maths question, I knew I should have paid more attention in Maths classes For example what should the position be if they click somewhere between Medial and Inferior more towards the lower right portion of the div or the lower left portion of the divp  pMany thanks   p

Negative 669 pIve been looking for a solution for this for a while now and the only fixes I found only affect the way the text is displayed in the editor itself and not how the generated text will look when sentsaved somewhere else. Im talking CSS fixes and stuff like that.p  pIm using CKEditor to compose and send emails trough our web application and while the css fixes change the font shown in the editor itself, the recieved emails are still displayed in TNR or whatever is inherited from the email client. Unless, of course, I change the font and size from the plugin for each paragraph. p  pFrom what Ive noticed whenever you set the font and size from within the plugin, CKEditor creates a span well, actually two, one with the font and one with the size with the newly changed style for example codeltspan stylefont Arialgtltspan stylefontsize 12gtltspangtltspangtcode and I figure I could just wrap the whole result in a span or div with my desired font and size styling, but that might interfere the users templates and styles.p  pIs there any way to set the default text styles as seen by the recipient of the emails from the plugin itself or will I have to come up with a hack to it.p

I moved my code to applicationDidBecomeActive. I also added a BOOL property to the appDelegate called fastAppSwitching probably the wrong name for it. I set this to YES in applicationhandleOpenURL and applicationopenURLsourceApplicationannotation. Then I added the following code to applicationdidFinishLaunchingWithOptionsp  precode        if launchOptions              self.fastAppSwitching  YES                  else              self.fastAppSwitching  NO          codepre  pIn applicationDidBecomeActive, I used the following codep  precode    if fastAppSwitching  YES          self.fastAppSwitching  NO stop, dont go any further          else         ...      codepre  pEDIT2 MaxGabriel makes a good point below Just a warning to others taking the solution described here, applicationDidBecomeActive is called when the user e.g. ignores a phone call or text message, unlike applicationWillEnterForeground. This is actually also true for inapp purchases and Facebook inapp authorization new in iOS 6. So, with some further testing, this is the current solutionp  pAdd a new Bool called passedThroughWillEnterForeground.p  pIn applicationWillResignActivep  precodeself.passedThroughWillEnterForeground  NO codepre  pIn applicationDidEnterBackgroundp  precodeself.passedThroughWillEnterForeground  NO codepre  pIn applicationWillEnterForegroundp  precodeself.passedThroughWillEnterForeground  YES codepre  pIn applicationDidBecomeActivep  precode    if passedThroughWillEnterForeground          we are NOT returning from 6.0 inapp authorization dialog or inapp purchase dialog, etc         do nothing with this BOOL  just reset it         self.passedThroughWillEnterForeground  NO          else          we ARE returning from 6.0 inapp authorization dialog or inapp purchase dialog  IE         This is the same as fastapp switching in our book, so lets keep it simple and use this to set that         self.fastAppSwitching  YES           if fastAppSwitching  YES           self.fastAppSwitching  NO          else          ...      codepre  pEDIT3 I think we also need a bool to tell if app was launched from terminated.p

Negative 669 pSo Im not sure what to call it, but its that bar on the left in Storyboard Editor in Xcode that displays all of the different scenes.  I love using storyboards, but my biggest pet peeve with them is that the scenes are organized in that list in an utterly random fashion.  Every time I add a new view controller to the storyboard it gets inserted into a seemingly random place on the list.  Two nearby views are not at all nearby in the scene listing.p  pSo my question is this Is it possible to reorder the scenes in that view, or to force some kind of sorting p

Negative 669 pId like configure a centralized logging into WebLogic 12C. According to the business requirements I have to use Syslog in the production environment and I have to provide custom eg. file, console log in the developer and test environment. And Id like to handle only 1 centralized log configuration for each applications in the domain. The applications use SLF4J API. In Glassfish 3.1 and WebLogic 10.3.5 works well when I put the Logback or Log4J bridge and their implementation into the domain lib and I configure them. But in WebLogic 12C Ive ran into much proplem. The main problem is WL already contains SLF4J binding among the modules and I dont want to modify the WL, or shall I. So when I put a second binding the SLF4J cant initialize itthem and uses the default JUL logger. Ive also tried to configure the Log4J logger via the WL Admin console but only the server messages goes to the Log4J logger the messages of the applications still goes to JUL. a hrefhttpdocs.oracle.comcdE2432901web.1211e24428configlogs.htmi1011558 relnofollowhttpdocs.oracle.comcdE2432901web.1211e24428configlogs.htmi1011558a, a hrefhttpsforums.oracle.comforumsthread.jspathreadID1037672 relnofollowhttpsforums.oracle.comforumsthread.jspathreadID1037672ap  pSo how can I maintain only 1 Log4J or Logback or any other solution that satisfies the reqs above configuration in a WebLogic12C domainp  pThx for the helpp

I am on this part of the tutorialp  pa hrefhttpwww.playframework.comdocumentation2.1.0JavaGuide6 relnofollowhttpwww.playframework.comdocumentation2.1.0JavaGuide6ap  pIt worked fine last night but when I woke up this morning I got an error in firefoxfirebug jsRoutes is not defined.  I could scroll up in the code and click on the assetsjavascriptsroutes in my head and there it was, the javascript had jsRoutes in it.  I had not changed anything but just in case, I had a copy of the zentasks application from the sample folder that comes with play.  I ran it and got the same error.  I was worried that I had changed something and just forgot in both my written version and the copied version of the zentasks application.  So I again copied the zentasks application from the sample folder and ran it.  It worked, no error and no issues clicking buttons in the application.  So I figured I had changed something and forgot and I was ready to start tracking down the problem.p  pThen something strange happened.  I ran the application that I was writing my self and IT WORKED The error was gone.  I tried the first copy I made and it worked also.  I then tried the web browser built into eclipse with my version of the application and it didnt work.  Then I tried to run it in chrome and I received the same error jsRoutes is not defined yet I could navigate up and click on the javascript source assetsjavascriptsroutes and I could see the jsRoutes in the script.  I continued on down the tutorial because it was working in firefox.  At the end of the tutorial you test the webpages with jUnit.  The tests failed with the same error jsRoutes is not defined.

Negative 669 pOn my website people can post images on a board and drag them around.p  pAt the moment I use the followingp  precodewidth60  height 40 codepre  pThey can save their work.p  pThe position is saved with margins so a image can be codetop50pxcode and codeleft150pxcodep  pSo its 50px to the right of the left border of the div and 50px down from the top of the div.p  pIf they load their work it has to look exactly the same.p  pSo if a image was on the lower right corner it has to be on the lower right corner when they load the file.p  pMy problem is that if a user loads it on a different resolution it takes the margins and if the screen resolution is bigger on the next screen the image wont be on the lower right corner because there is more room cause 50 of 1200 is less than 50 of 1900.p  pSo I have to use codewidthcode and codeheightcode in px but if i set 600px on the 1200 px it will look good but 600px on the 1900px wont look good.p  pIs there a way to use px but make it look good on every pagep  pstrongSo basicly i want to use px but it must look the same like when i use  so the margins will be the same and the page looks the same no big open spaces on big resolutions.strongp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comDTKik.png altExamplep  pon the example i made a board in 1366 and reopened it in 1024 the images take the margin from the left so it is out of the original board.p  pBut the board yellow background is the same  of the screen.p  pSo i want a board thats the same  of the screen but loads the images the same on every resolution so bottom right corner on 1025 screen must be bottom right corner of 1366 screen. p  pif i use px only the site looks diffrent on all resolutions and thats what i want t prevent.p

Negative 669 pAssume there is a book which has various chapters say 5 in it. Complete book is present in a single html page with all 5 chapters in it.  Each Chapter is some html content and is present inside a div with a class name called chapter. You can take any dummy HTML content for each of the five pages with  tags in it as Chapter 1, Chapter 2 ..... and Chapter 5. p  pNow when the page opens the first chapter is shown to the user. Which has Chapter 1 in the heading. The single chapter is bigger than the height of the window so user can scroll to read this chapter. But once the user reaches the end of the chapter the user can not see or scroll to the next chapter. p  pWhen the user is at the end of the chapter he sees a button at the bottom right saying go to the next chapter.  Imp This button can not be the part of chapter HTML it has to be generated programmatically at the end of the chapter via js. p  pWhen the person clicks on this button the next chapter chapter 2 in this case should scroll up from the bottom automatically till the top pushing the first page out of the window. So the whole screen then should be covered by chapter 2 shown with the animation by pushing chapter 1 above. p  pSo at a given time user can only see one chapter by scrolling up or down. He will have to click the buttons to access the next or the previous chapter.p  pSimilarly for Chapter 2 there will be a button at the top of the page to go to chapter 1 in which the Chapter 1 will come from the top pushing Chapter2 down completely out of the window. And for chapter 2 there will also be a button at the bottom of the page clicking on which user will be taken to chapter 3 in the similar animation format. p  pThis is a sort of interaction that the user will have while reading the book.  Please help me. I need it very urgently.  Thanksp

Negative 669 pIm developing a Laravel 4 app that will make the same CRUD operations on my dataset available through a JSON REST API and a Web UI.

Or should I be looking at a different approach altogetherp  pThanks.p

Negative 669 pI have a program that outputs lines of CSV data that I want to load into a data frame. I currently load the data like sop  precodetmpFilename lt tmpfile systempasteprocName, gt, tmpFilename, waitTRUE myData lt read.csvtmpFilename  I also pass in colClasses and nrows for efficiency codepre  pHowever, I thought redirecting the output to a file just to read from it was inefficient the program spits out about 30MB, so I want to handle it with optimal performance. I thought codetextConnectioncode would solve this, so I triedp  precodecon lt textConnectionsystemprocName, internTRUE myData lt read.csvcon codepre  pThis runs a lot slower, though, and whereas the first solution degrades linearly with input size, the codetextConnectioncode solutions performance degrades exponentially it seems. The slowest part is creating the codetextConnectioncode. coderead.csvcode here actually completes quicker than in the first solution since its reading from memory.p  pMy question is then, is creating a file just to run coderead.csvcode on it my best option with respect to speed Is there a way to speed up the creation of a textConnection bonus why is creating a textConnection so slowp

Negative 669 pIm using pygtk to make a questionnaire type application and in particular Im struggling with one aspect.p  pIve tried to design it so that you can ask one or two people at a time. So I have radio buttons that the user can select between either person one or person two. The reason Ive done it this way is so that I only need to use one set of codegtk.Entrycode widgets, codegtk.ComboBoxcode widgets,...etc.p  pSo what I currently have set up is an assign data method where, depending on which person youve asked, it saves the codegettextcode information to a specific variable. p  pI was wondering if there was some cleverer way of having the specific persons information for the fields theyve already entered appear in the widgets when you select them with the radio buttons other than just a long list of codewidget.settext  specificvariablecodep  pThanks  p

Negative 669 pI have a form with lots of nested splitcontainers and listviews and a picturebox and stuff. When certain things happen in my program I want an overlay to appear over everything in a little box in the middle of my form with a short message. Then if possible have it fade away. I thought about just using a panel or something but Im not sure how best to make it appear over the entire form regardless of other controls. I can only get it to sit inside one splitcontainer at a time rather than floating over all of them. It would also be really handy if it did not interfere with the focus or clicking on my form but that is less important if it is a whole lot more complicated.p  pWhat is the best way to approach thisp

Negative 669 pThis is my first project, Im trying to teach myself so please bear with me and dont assume anything about my knowledge of programming.p  pWhat I want to do is create a console program that will take file, Text.txt, in this instance, read it, turn the ASCII it into hexadecimal and then overwrite the Text.txt file with the hex code, and if run again, will reverse the process.p  pIs there a way to do this on a command basis so that I have to type something, lets say Start into the console before it will actually initialize this process And on top of that, keep the console open so I could type Start or another word, if this is impossible and have it undo the processp  pI currently have this tacked onto the end to keep the program open, but how would I use it when doing what I wish to do as mentioned above Or is there a better method [code]             stdstring inp  precodewhile stdcin gtgt in ampamp in  exit   return 0  codepre  pI know I need to use fstream in order to import and export but Im not sure how to do it without closing everything immediately after it has finished or how to tie it in to make it convert the hexadecimalASCII first.p  pThanks for any help or tips you can give.p  pEdit Sorry, my question isp  pWhat is the basic process for turning the ASCII in the Text.txt file into hex and then exporting it I have a basic understanding of the fstream concept on its own but Im not really sure how to implement it along with the conversion of the text, and I dont really know where to start on exactly how to convert the text into hex.p

Negative 669 pI am trying to build a tool which allows the designers to import 3d models created in 3ds max and converted to three.js json of parts of furniture and assemble the furniture using these parts by moving them around. After they are done with the assembeling, I need to export the final furniture model geometry, materials etc as svg image for display on my website in a 2d home designer tool. How can I convert three.js models one or more to svg. I need to do the same in the 3d home designer tool also as the user can reassemble the furniture himself and the svg needs to be updated on the fly after reassembeling is done. Is there a three.js plugin, example, sample code or external javascript library which allows me to convert one or more three.js models to svg in the browser. Any help is appreciated.p
Negative 669 pIt seems like all of the static site generators I have found completely regenerate the entire site every time a change is made to some file in the site.p  pFor example, one of the more popular site generators in use is Jekyll, which powers Github Pages. Every time an author makes a change say a grammar correction in a post file, or a change to the about.html layout and needs to regenerate that content, Jekyll gives no choice other that to regenerate the entire site, even if there are hundreds of files whose output is unchanged by the recent edits.p  pThe time it takes to regenerate large sites seems to be a common complaint against most static site generators.p  pIs there any technical reason from the POV of development or engineering of static site generators that prevents someone from writing a static site generator that is intelligent about its contents and could be selfaware to the point that it could understand which files were changed and which files depend on it or viceversa and would only regenerate the necessary filesp  pSince most people especially JekyllGH Pages users are storing their sites in git repository, it even seems like a site generator could make use of the commit information and track changes and rely on that information to know which files need to be regenerated and which can be left alone.

Negative 669 pBACKGROUND  Im making use of Azure Local Storage.  This is supposed to be treated as volatile storage.  First of all, how long do the files amp directories that I create persist on the Web Role Instances there are 2, in my case  Do I need to worry about running out of storage if I dont do cleanup on those filesdirectories after each user is done with it  What Im doing is Im pulling multiple files from a separate service, storing them in Azure Local Storage, compressing them into a zip file and storing that zip file, and then finally file streaming that zip file to the browser.p  pTHE PROBLEM  This all works beautifully except for one minor hiccup.  The file seems to stream to the browser asynchronously.  So what happens is that an exception gets thrown when I try to delete the zipped file from azure local storage afterward since it is still in the process of streaming to the browser.

Negative 669 pCould anyone explain if additional synchronization, e.g., locking, is needed in the following two situations in a Linux network driver I am interested in the kernel 2.6.32 and newer.p  h21. .probe VS .ndoopenh2  pIn a driver for a PCI network card, the codenetdevicecode instance is usually registered in code.probecode callback. Suppose a driver specifies code.ndoopencode callback in the codenetdeviceopscode, performs other necessary operations and then calls coderegisternetdevcode. p  pIs it possible for that code.ndoopencode callback to be called by the kernel after coderegisternetdevcode but before the end of code.probecode callback I suppose it is, but may be, there is a stronger guarantee, something that ensures that the device can be opened no earlier than code.probecode endsp  pIn other words, if code.probecode callback accesses, say, the private part of the netdevice struct after coderegisternetdevcode and codendoopencode callback accesses that part too, do I need to use locks or other means to synchronize these accessesp  h22. .ndostartxmit VS NAPI pollh2  pIs there any guarantee that, for a given network device, code.ndostartxmitcode callback and NAPI codepollcode callback provided by a driver never execute concurrentlyp  pI know that code.ndostartxmitcode is executed with BH disabled at least and codepollcode runs in the softirq, and hence, BH context. But this serializes execution of these callbacks on the local CPU only. Is it possible for code.ndostartxmitcode and codepollcode for the same network device to execute simultaneously on different CPUsp  pAs above, if these callbacks access the same data, is it needed to protect the data with a lock or somethingp  pReferences to the kernel code andor the docs are appreciated.p  pstrongEDITstrong p  pTo check the first situation, I conducted an experiment and added a 1minute delay right before the end of the call to coderegisternetdevcode in e1000 driver kernel 3.11rc1. I also added debug prints there in code.probecode and code.ndoopencode callbacks. Then I loaded e1000.ko, and tried to access the network device it services before the delay ended in fact, NetworkManager did that before me, then checked the system log. p  pstrongResultstrong yes, it is possible for code.ndoopencode to be called even before the end of code.probecode although the race window is usually rather small.p  pThe second situation code.ndostartxmitcode VS NAPI codepollcode is still unclear to me and any help is appreciated.p

Negative 669 pIm trying to do the same thing asked in this question, a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions9319597cartogramchoroplethmapinrCartogram  choropleth map in Ra, but starting from a SpatialPolygonsDataFrame and hoping to end up with the same type of object.p  pI could save the object as a shapefile, use a hrefhttpscapetoad.choros.ch relnofollowscapetoada, reopen it and convert back, but Id rather have it all within R so that the procedure is fully reproducible, and so that I can code dozens of variations automatically.p  pIve forked the Rcartogram code on github and added my efforts so far a hrefhttpsgithub.comduncandooRcartogramblobmasterdemoSpPolyCart.R relnofollowherea.p  pEssentially what this demo does is create a SpatialGrid over the map, look up the population density at each point of the grid and convert this to a density matrix in the format required for codecartogramcode to work on. So far so good.p  pBut, how to interpolate the original map points based on the output of codecartogramcode p  pThere are two problems here. The first is to get the map and grid into the same units to allow interpolation. The second is to access every point of every polygon, interpolate it, and keep them all in right order.p  pThe grid is in grid units and the map is in projected units in the case of the example longlat. Either the grid must be projected into longlat, or the map into grid units. My thought is to make a fake CRS and use this along with the codespTransformcode function in codepackagergdalcode, since this handles every point in the object with minimal fuss.p  pAccessing every point is difficult because they are several layers down into the SpPDF object objectpolygonsPolygonslinescoords I think. Any ideas how to access these while keeping the structure of the overall map intactp

Negative 669 pIm building a mobile app that needs a backend that Ive chosen to host using Amazon Web Services.br Their mobile SDKs provide APIs to work directly with the DynamoDB making my app a thick client, including user authenticationauthorization with their IAM service which is what Im going to use to track users. This makes it easy to say user X wants their information. Heres their temporary access key. Oh, heres the information you requested.  p  pHowever, if I used RDS as a backend database, Id have to create web services in PHP or Javaetc that my app can talk to. Then Id also have to implement the authenticationauthorization myself within my web service which I feel could get very messy. Id also have to host the web service on an EC2 instance, as well as having the RDS instance. So my costs would increase.  p  pThe latter seems like it would be a lot of work, something which I could avoid by using DynamoDB and its API as my backend.p  pAm I correct in my reasoning here Or is there an easy way to authenticateauthorize a PHP web service with an AWS RDS databasebr I ask because Ive only ever worked with relational databases before, so there would be a learning curve to get the NoSQL db running.

Negative 669 pI have a button. I want to change the image on initial touch. If the touch is less then 1 seconds, I want it to do X. If the touch is longer then 1 second, I want it to do Y.p  pIm having trouble figuring out how to handle this. A UIButton has proved troublesome so I thought I could do it with codeUIGestureRecognizerscode or codetouchesBegincodep  pInitial thought was have a codeUITapGestureRecognizercode to detected just a quick tap to do X, and use a codeUILongTapGestureRecognizercode to handle a longer press to do Y. p  pThe issue is a codeUITapGestureRecognizercode does not flag codeUIGestureRecognizerStateBegancode, it only ever sends a notice for codeUIGestureRecognizerStateEndcode.p  pSo I decided trying a combination of overridding the codetouchesBegincode and codetouchesEndcode methods and using a codeUILongPressGestureRecognizercodep  precodevoidtouchesBeganNSSet touches withEventUIEvent event       change image   voidtouchesEndedNSSet touches withEventUIEvent event       do X      change image to original image   IBActionlongPressDetectedUILongPressGestureRecognizer recognizer      DLogfired      if recognizer.state  UIGestureRecognizerStateBegan           Do y          change image to original image          else if recognizer.state  UIGestureRecognizerStateCancelled            else if recognizer.state  UIGestureRecognizerStateEnded         codepre  pIf the codeUILongPressGestureRecognziercode fires, it cancels the inital codetouchesBegancode does not fire codetouchesEndedcode method.p  pBut I have run into the issue where the codetouchesBegincode method is slow to fire. There is a .5 second delay in the method being fired. What baffles me, if I use codeUILongPressGestureRecognizercode with a codelongTap.minimumPressDuration  0code, it fires instantly.p  pThis is with in the program where I need it to be. Playing around with it in a dummy area, the codetouchesBeginscode fires instantly as well.p  pWhat could cause it to lag within the programp  pIs there a different way I can obtain the desired effectp

Negative 669 pIve been trying to develop a cross platform mobile app, very simple one DB driven, so I had to chose between PhoneGap, Appcelerator and Rhomobile. p  pIm a big fan of Ruby and ROR, so using the same MVC structure and Ruby syntax is a big advantage for me. p  pAnyways I would like to ask few questions here if any of you guys used it already as its a very risky decision specially that it is the least known framework among the mentioned above. p  ul lipDo you know any solid smartphone App that used Rhomobile this could give it more credibility. I dont wanna invest much time developing the solution then to get refused from apple appstore for some reason or to face any major problem in the production. pli lipDid you notice any performance issues specially with the UI as it is not a purely native application unlike RubyMotion or ObjectiveC  pli lipDo you have any idea of the pricing for commercial uses is there any fees or is it totally free app pli ul  pThanks in advancep
Negative 669 pHi I am building an internal distribution app and from within the app I would like it to hide incoming notifications, even if the iPhone is asleep.  Basically my app will be active and if the screen sleeps I would like to hide incoming notifications from being displayed.  I dont want to block them entirely, just hide them while my app is active.  Are there any private APIs someone can point me to to being able to accomplish this  Or does my app not have any control over them when the iPhone is asleep Even with private APIs.  Thank youp

Negative 669 pIn the three bitwise left shift code fragments below, its interesting that examples 2 and 3 are treated differently by Java.

Negative 669 pI have been working with the sample code to allow a user to submit a photo in a google form for update to Google spreadsheet. I am working with the original code by Serge Insas that I was able to get to work exactly how he intended it to work. Now Im trying to work with it to allow for my needs which is simply to have more than one drop down list, I need to capture more information than what the original code allowed for. I am very new to this and doing most by trial and error. I can get the form to display with two list boxes but the drop down list of both of them is the same List1p  pHere is the code Ive modified, it will post what is selected in the second list box but I need the items from list2 to show up instead.

Negative 669 pI have heard templates can be used to replicate dynamic polymorphism through static polymorphism. If this is the case I am puzzled how it works. p  pI thought the purpose of templates was to replicate the exact same behaviour, but across different classes. In contract dynamic polymorphism allows you to call the exact same API which can have strongdifferent behaviourstrong in the functions for different classes If there is different behaviour across the objects, how can templates achieve thisp

Negative 669 pI have a base object in a game that is used for stats. I copy the object each time I start a battle for the 40 sum units on the battle map.p  pI then modify the stats object for each unit. I of course do not want to pass by reference.

Negative 669 pIm working on a server backend component for an app, and one goal is to log all the messages transmitted through the app using MQTT.  To do this, I wanted to use the app as a library of sorts so that I could use the objects defined within to parse the messages coming through, since none of the messages will be transmitted as standard types.  Im using IntelliJ for the Java development, and Android Studio for the Android development.  Is this possible  I was previously able to import the code as a module, which let me use the types defined within, but when I went to build the project it tried to build the Android code as well and failed because IntelliJ hadnt set up Android dependencies.  Should I try and set the Android SDK as a dependency in the app module, and then build  Or am I approaching this the wrong way  if its even possible  I understand that there are also Library projects which looks like a possible solution, it would just require refactoring all the applicable code out to a different project and I was hoping that wouldnt be necessary.p

Negative 669 pI have been trying different error handling techniques with Express. First I was just using codeprocess.onuncaughtExceptioncode. I quickly learned that it was bad practice. After that, I tried using the new Domain feature in node js. I wrapped each request in a domain, however, if I would send a response and then do some more work on the server dealing with the same request it would not catch the errors from those functions after the response was sent. I then tried moving to the builtin error handling with Express using codenexterrcode. However, I am running into the same situation. If I send a response and then a function has an error after the response has been sent, my error handler is not called. Here is some code as an example.p  precodeasync.waterfall[         functionafter                      hashPasswordpassword, after         ,         functionhash, after                      makeTokenhash, after         ,         functionhash, token, after                      insertUserInfoemail, username, hash, ip, token, after         ,         functiontoken, id, after                      req.session.attempts  0             res.json err 0, attempts 0  Response is sent             afternull, token, id         ,         functiontoken, id, after                      sendEmailtoken, email, renderEmail Errors not caught             makeFolderid, after Errors not caught              ], functionerr           iferr             nexterr        codepre  pAs you can see from the code, I am registering a new user. Now, I could wait until I have completed all of my logic to send back the response but I thought that it would make the request appear much faster for the user if I did some of the less important things after the response has been sent. I am willing to change my code to perform everything THEN send the response, but I want to make sure that there is no solution out there that I have not tried yet. p

Negative 669 pI know there are several answers reagarding this problem with Qt like this one a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions20495620qt511applicationfailedtostartbecauseplatformpluginwindowsismissiQt 5.1.1 Application failed to start because platform plugin quotwindowsquot is missinga. Im using Qt 5, but it seems this problem is also in other versions.p  pThe accepted answer was not my problem, but following the links the solution to copy the platforms directory to the executable works fine. However I find this solution quite unsatisfactory, because it means that I have to distribute this same directory all over the place. In the project I have to copy it into the DebugRelease branches for EACH AND EVERY project that I create. Running codedesigner.execode I also have this problem, so I have to copy it there as well, and so on.p  pPutting the plugin directory from my QT installation directory into the PATH didnt solve the problem, though I dont really understand why. Apparently there is some custom code loading the required plugin DLLs.p  pSo I wonder if there is not some acceptable way of doing this properly, like setting a QTHOME variable or similar, so I dont have to copy the DLLs all over the place.p

Negative 669 pIm doing a small academic assignment, in which Im supposed to implement an eclipse plugin for the NuSMV language a model checking language using Xtext. The xtext grammar was provided with some minor bugs. Ive created an Xtext project and called it smv.project with language name of NuSMV and extension of .smv. Ive coppied the provided Xtext grammar into smv.projectsrcNuSMV.xtext, generated artifacts, and created runtime eclipse. Seems to work fine except those minor bugs which are originated in the grammar in my opinion.p  pNow, my next step is to change the default colors in my DSL. Obviously, every user can do that for himself in the eclipse menus when using my plugin, but I wand the DEFAULT color to change. Ive read the Xtext documentation for syntax coloring. It was short and had many terms I didnt understand. What I did understand is that there are 2 kinds of syntax coloring in Xtext, Lexical and Semantic. I didnt understand the meaning of each but it seemed to me that Lexical coloring is simpler, so I went for it. The documentation said that I should implement the interface IHighlightingConfiguration. It showed an example of implementation called DefaultHighlightingConfiguration full source can be seen here a hrefhttpsgithub.comeclipsextextblobmasterpluginsorg.eclipse.xtext.uisrcorgeclipsextextuieditorsyntaxcoloringDefaultHighlightingConfiguration.java relnofollowhttpsgithub.comeclipsextextblobmasterpluginsorg.eclipse.xtext.uisrcorgeclipsextextuieditorsyntaxcoloringDefaultHighlightingConfiguration.javaa. Ive coppied this implementation into my project, to smv.project.uisrcsmv.project.ui.editor.syntaxcoloring. Of course, I changed the package line in the beginning of the file. Ive changed all red values to 255 to see difference. Ive generated the artifacts again, created runtime eclipse, created a .smv file but the colors were the same.p  pMy guess was that I need to set my new class in some variable or configuration class... I tried searching for DefaultHighlightingConfiguration in the examples repository and found out that its used in the file XtextProposalProvider.java full source a hrefhttpsgithub.comeclipsextextblob87a6c7dc25074ca4ff28429c059e728ef420b926pluginsorg.eclipse.xtext.xtext.uisrcorgeclipsextextuicontentassistXtextProposalProvider.java relnofollowhttpsgithub.comeclipsextextblob87a6c7dc25074ca4ff28429c059e728ef420b926pluginsorg.eclipse.xtext.xtext.uisrcorgeclipsextextuicontentassistXtextProposalProvider.javaa in line 235  Were overriding getKeywordDisplayString.

Negative 669 pThere is an ajax loaded content into a codeltdivgtcode in the page I use. All the pages in the project are secured under login. And by the logic, if the user keeps the window idle for 300 seconds or more the PHP will redirect to login page. This works good when the page is refreshed and navigated. But the problem I face is, when I load a codeltdivgtcode or any element with an AJAX output, sometimes the login page is loaded within the element. This is because the window is idle and the PHP server redirects to login page. I need to redirect the main page to the login page instead of loading the redirected login page via AJAX.

Negative 669 pMy title is a bit complex, but I will break down really simply what I am doing here. p  pI have an existing database with about 20 tables. I have a project that my partner has decided that we should use the old Simple Membership over Identity. This is no longer an option on the table, we have finalized that decision. WE will be creating the project in Web Forms using Visual Studio 2012 because that is what we have licenses for.p  pstrongStep 1strong I started a new project in VS 2012 using Web Forms and I pointed the Default Connection String at my current database and registered a few users. This created the tables I needed for membership in my SQL Server 2012 database.p  pstrongStep 2strong I did some relational mapping in my database connecting existing tables to the new membership UserIDs where needed so that my existing tables are now related to the membership stuff. p  pstrongStep 3strong Here is where I am a bit lost because normally I have used SqlDataSources with Web Forms in the past. I have some experience with MVC so I would like to do things differently in this web forms project and start from Database First and import my database tables into a Data Access Layer, Im thinking of using a Class Library for this.p  pMY QUESTION strongWhen importing my EDMX for database first. Should Ibr A Bring in all of the tables Existing Tables  New Membership Tablesbr B Just bring in the Tables that are NOT part of Membershipbr C Bring in my Existing Tables and only the User and Membership table or D Do you have any other ideastrong    p  pMy reasoning for this question is that I know that I can access the Membership stuff in the Web Forms Project but will it possibly be needed in the Class Library since my application will eventually be very User centric. Lots of tracking of user time and logins, assigning tasks and projects, permissions to that user etc.. I was leaning toward strongAstrongp  pI know this is a very complex question or maybe I should say it may have many answers all due to things that I may not know yet or I have not explained fully. But Im looking for some direction as I have never used a Class Library or Database first in this way or in a Web Forms Application.p  pstrongSnapshot of Databasestrongp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comon8ot.png altep
Negative 669 pId like to implement a listbox widget using the current web components specs. Moreover, the resulting listbox should conform to the ARIA standard. Instantiating the listbox widget should be as simple asp  precodeltxlistboxgt     ltxoptiongtOption 1ltxoptiongt     ltxoptiongtOption 2ltxoptiongt ltxlistboxgt codepre  pFor purposes of cleanliness and encapsulation, everything else should be rendered in shadow dom. To implement this widget, two custom elements, codeltxlistboxgtcode and codeltxoptiongtcode are registered. The toplevel element of the shadow dom of codeltxlistboxgtcode is a codeltdivgtcode that carries the coderolelistboxcode and the codeariaactivedescendentcode attributes for accessibility I dont want these attributes on the codeltxlistboxgtcode element because they are implementation details.p  pIn order for codeariaactivedescendentcode to work, one needs ids on the option elements. Putting ids directly on the codeltxoptiongtcode elements wont work out of two reasons Firstly, it would pollute the id namespace of the document that uses the listbox widget. Secondly and even more importantly, ids do not work across shadow boundaries which is one purpose of the shadow dom, so the ids of the options have to live in the same shadow dom as the codeltdivgtcode with the codeariaactivedescendentcode attribute.p  pA solution for this would be to surround each codeltxoptiongtcode that is rendered as content inside the shadow dom of codeltxlistboxgtcode with another codeltdivgtcode belonging to that shadow dom, on which an id can be put.p  pstrongMy question is Is this the right way to go and how to implement this using the custom element and shadow dom web apisstrongp
Negative 669 pI have an activity that displays a users favorited cars in a car dealership app. Cars can be of different types so I am using an ExpandableListView to categorize the cars in groups that

childrencars there are in that particular groupcategory.p  pI cant seem to find any existing methods to do this Tried with the groupIndicator but I do not want to mess with that, rather keep it and

And I would need to output only the top most term between the two duplicatesp  precodeID  Name    Term 1   Suzy    A 1   Suzy    B 2   John    A 2   John    B 3   Pete    A 4   Carl    A 5   Sally   B codepre  pAny Suggestions would be helpful Thanks,p  pJustinp

However, it is red, then blue, then blue, then blue.p  precodelthtmlgt   ltheadgt   ltstyle typetextcssgt     .v1 span        color red          .v2 span        color blue        ltstylegt   ltheadgt   ltbody classv1gt     ltspangtOutsideltspangt     ltdiv classv2gt       ltspangtDiv 1ltspangt       ltdiv classv1gt         ltspangtDiv 2ltspangt         ltdiv classv2gt           ltspangtDiv 3ltspangt         ltdivgt       ltdivgt     ltdivgt   ltbodygt lthtmlgt codepre  pWhat is a good way to do thisp

Negative 669 pI was creating an Office addin using Visual Studio tools for Office, and part of deployinginstalling the addin is creating Windows registry entries for it.

Negative 669 pI have an interesting issue occurring frequently in my Spring web app.  Basically, a user logs into the site successfully, navigates around to protected pages for a while and then for some reason, the server starts to return 403 responses.

Negative 669 pIm trying to achieve maximum performance in a library that needs to convert C strings to byte[] before sending them off somewhere.p  pSince a char in UTF8 takes maximum 4 bytes, my current approach is to preallocate a large byte[]. When a string arrives for encoding, I can use a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibrarysystem.text.encodervvs.110.aspx relnofollowSystem.Text.Encodera to populate the byte array with it. If the strings char length  4 is bigger than my buffer, I allocate a new one optimizing via a buffer pool, but this is supposed to become relatively rare quite quickly.p  pMy only issue with this solution, is that System.Text.Encoder doesnt appear to accept a string  only a char[]. Retrieving a char[] from the string involves another seemingly needless copy. Theres an unsafe version with char pointers, but Im prohibited from using that in my library at the moment.p  pAs a side note, StringWriter, which also does UTF8 conversion, maintains an internal buffer. This is again unsuitable  I need my own buffer since I encode other data types as well e.g. ints.p  pSo does anyone have any idea where Encoder doesnt provide a method that works directly on Stringp

Negative 669 pIve been trying to get to grips with git add, particularly in relation to how it behaves for new vs modified vs deleted files.p  pIve looked at various guides and tutorials out on the web, but a lot of whats out there seems to be outdated now, particularly in relation to whether emdeletedem files are staged removed from the index, since it seems that the default behaviour of git has changed recently or at least more recently that the article concerned.p  pEven the documentation at a hrefhttpgitscm.comdocsgitadd relnofollowhttpgitscm.comdocsgitadda has me slightly confused, or uncertain about what is and isnt staged with git add.p  pSo let us consider the basic commandp  precode git add ltpathspecgt codepre  pMy understanding from the official documentation is that, where the pathspec is directory name e.g. dir or dirsubdir or even ., this causes all new files emandem modified files emandem deleted files in that directory to be staged i.e. local files deleted will also be deleted in remote repo.p  pBut where pathspec is a file or set of files e.g. doc.txt or .txt or dir.js, staging is only for emnewem and emmodifiedem files, not deleted files.p  pIs that correct  Is that how git chooses between the two regimes, assuming no other flags are usedp  pAnd then the explicit flags are A to stage new, modified and deleted. Or u to stage modified and deleted but not new. Or noall to stage new and modified but not deleted.p  pIs that a fair summary, or have I misunderstood  The docs do refer to a emleadingem directory name, so maybe the rule is that dir.txt emwouldem stage deleted filesp  pWould be useful if someone knowledgable could state explain the behaviour for each of the following examples, just by stating something like new yes, modified yes, deleted nop  precode git add .  git add dir  git add dirsubdir  git add dir.txt  git add .txt  git add file.txt  git add .file.txt  git add dirfile.txt codepre  pFor example p  precode git add .    new yes, modified yes, deleted yes codepre  pMany thanks.p

Each codeFormViewcode has its own codeEditItemTemplatecode and codePagerTemplatecode with codeDefaultModeEditcode. I am not using a codeSqlDataSourcecode, but instead databinding programatically on the codePageLoadcode when codeifPage.IsPostBackcode and also calling the databinding method when the codePageIndexChangingcode method is called. The pager template contains a Back and a Next button set with codeCommandArgumentPrevcode and codeCommandArgumentNextcode, respectively, and both set with codeCommandNamePagecode. p  pThe paging works great on the first codeFormViewcode. When I hit the back or next button, it pages i.e. rebinds appropriately. During the 1st codeFormViewcodes paging event, I also successfully call the binding methods for the 2nd and 3rd codeFormViewcode since I want them to bind data that is specific to the page selected in the 1st codeFormViewcode. p  pBut, when I page back to the first page of the 1st codeFormViewcode i.e. codePageIndex  0code, and then try to page forward in the 2nd codeFormViewcode, the datakey for the 1st codeFormViewcode is null. In fact, the codeformview1.DataSourcecode is null for the 1st codeFormViewcode when I try to click a navigation button on the 2nd codeFormViewcode. p  pThen, heres where I thought it was weird, ... if I click back a second time on the 1st codeFormViewcode, THEN the codeformview1.DataSourcecode is fine, and I can then navigate in the 2nd codeFormViewcode. p  pAll viewstates for the formviews and the buttons are set to true.  I have tried calling codeformview1.DataBindcode inside codeformview2codes paging event before any paging occurs but no success there. I have also tried setting properties codeUseSubmitBehaviorFalsecode and codeCausesValidationFalsecode on the paging buttons. Admittedly, I did this without really understanding the behavior but rather implemented after seeing it suggested in solutions for other somewhat related problems. p  pThe templates are rather long since there are many fields in each. But the codeFormViewcode tags look like this            p  precodeltaspFormView IDfvHeader runatserver DataKeyNamesObjectID DefaultModeEdit AllowPagingTrue OnModeChangingfvHeaderModeChanging OnPageIndexChanging fvHeaderPageIndexChanginggt  ltEditItemTemplategt ..... ltEditItemTemplategt ltaspFormViewgt codepre  pPagerTemplatesp  precode       ltPagerSettings ModeNextPrevious gt        ltPagerTemplategt            ltspan classlabelsgtPage ltfvHeader.PageIndex1gt of ltfvHeader.PageCount gtltspangtampnbsp            ltaspButton IDbtnBack runatserver CommandArgumentPrev CommandNamePage CssClassbtnHdr Textampltamplt Back gtampnbsp            ltaspButton IDbtnNext runatserver CommandArgumentNext CommandNamePage CssClassbtnHdr TextNext ampgtampgt gtampnbspltPagerTemplategt codepre  pNote that codefvHeadercode is what Im calling codeformview1code for simplicity in my question. p  pBackNext buttons C code and databinding the 1st formviewp  precode    protected void fvHeaderPageIndexChangingobject sender, FormViewPageEventArgs e                                  fvHeader.PageIndex  e.NewPageIndex                     bindFVInitial                       rebind fvSub1 2nd formview to get the 1st obs of the newly selected header record                     fvSub1.ChangeModeFormViewMode.Edit                     fvSub1.PageIndex  0                     bindSub1Initial  rebind 2nd subform                     fvSub2.ChangeModeFormViewMode.Edit                     fvSub2.PageIndex  0                     bindSub2Initial                     private void bindFVInitial                                  if conn.State  ConnectionState.Open                                              conn.Close                                           conn.Open                      if dtEOS  null  dtEOS.Rows.Count  0                                              sqlda  new SqlDataAdapterUSE dbWEF SELECT  FROM tblHeader WHERE [UserID]    Session[User]   AND [ProjectName]    Session[Project]  , conn                          sqlda.FilldtEOS                                           fvHeader.DataSource  dtEOS                     fvHeader.DataBind                      conn.Close                      if dtEOS.Rows.Count gt 0                                              fillDDfvHeader Fill dropdowns and databind ddls                                                     codepre  pBelow is the error message I receive when I attempt to navigate the 2nd formview. p  precode    Error in bindSub1Initial.

But clicking formviews back button one more time, refills and KEEPS the datasource, thereby allowing formview2 to fill and navigate perfectly. So strange... p

Negative 669 pWe are displaying the latest posts from our Wordpress site in a news box on our home page. Because we want the first image from each post to show in the news box, we are outputting the full post content in the feed. The problem is that since the posts use the full sized image, the feed contains links to these and although they show as thumbnail sized in the news box, each image could be up to 300k in size, which is impacting on the time it takes to load our home page.p  pSince we only display a snippet of each post in the news box, ideally we would like a feed that just shows the post extract and the first image, but thumbnail sized, not the full sized image.p  pOur server IBM iSeries also runs Wordpress slowly, so anything that we can do to reduce the volume of data and the sizes of images helps to make a difference.p  pI would prefer not to make complex changes to Wordpress, since although I know PHP, I struggle with changing code in Wordpress.p  pIs there a plugin or a simple code change that would do thisp  pAlternatively, I thought to create a PHP script that would run as a Cron job, Curling the output from the Wordpress feed, and building its own new feed, a appending the size attributes for the thumbnail to the full size post image and stripping the extract back to a desired length.  The news box could then use that feed rather than the Wordpress one.p  pSince we rarely post more than once a day, updating this feed every couple of hours ought to be adequate, or indeed it could check the datetime of the latest post against the time that the feed burner last ran.p

Negative 669 pIm developing a RESTful API to access a database of mathematical objects known as finite groups. These groups are typically described in the literature by a pair of positive integers, the one known as the size or order, the other as the index. For each order, the valid indices are the numbers 1 through N, for some N. For example, there are 10494213 groups of order 512, which have indices from 1 to 10494213, and 15 groups of order 513, which have indices from 1 to 15.p  pI have a good grip on how to make the groups accessible by their MongoDB ID, such as codegroup54e392723e7c302e2cc65e94code, but Id like to add the ability to access them through their order and index, such as codegroup512398742code.

Negative 669 pI created a very quick cube in blender and added simple 16x16 textures in the UV. I then created a scene.scnassets folder with the cube and image. I loaded in the model into Scenekit and ran it on my iPhone 5. The fps got down to 44 when I use the camera controls. It should be at 60 like the demo project. It has no lights and way less faces than the default ship. Does anyone know why this is happening Here is the download to my project for testingp  pa hrefhttpwww.mediafire.comdownload6g0thad00sdvsdvSceneKitgame.zip relnofollowhttpwww.mediafire.comdownload6g0thad00sdvsdvSceneKitgame.zipap  pI am not running it in the simulator p  pWhy is my project lagging so muchp
Negative 669 pAccording to a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions6348924enuminheritingfromintthisa post codeintcode is the backing type for codeenumcode. p  pWhen I check the source code of .NET a hrefhttpreferencesource.microsoft.commscorlibsystemenum.cs,36729210e317a805System.Enuma abstract class inherits from a hrefhttpreferencesource.microsoft.commscorlibsystemvaluetype.cs,915ba3e46633f948System.ValueTypea abstract class.p  pBut when I check the a hrefhttpreferencesource.microsoft.commscorlibsystemint32.cs,225942ed7b7a3252System.Int32a struct it inherits from interfaces but not from a hrefhttpreferencesource.microsoft.commscorlibsystemvaluetype.cs,915ba3e46633f948System.ValueTypea.p  pOn the contrary, when I decompile strongmscorlib.dllstrong and check the codeInt32code struct it says that the struct has base type of codeSystem.ValueTypecode.p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comi2Qse.png altenter image description herep  pBut still checking the decompiled source code I can not see anything about codeSystem.ValueTypecode.p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comFzxHS.png altenter image description herep  pIt makes me think that the codestructcode keyword makes the decleration autoSytem.ValueType, which Microsoft also denotes in this a hrefhttpsmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibraryah19swz4.aspxreferencea.p  pBut I still got a question. As far as I know, inheritance of two different classes from the same parent does not imply that one also inherits from other. I mean if codeBAcode and codeCAcode this does not always mean that codeCBcode.p  pAlso, when I check the source codes codeSystem.Enumcode has quite different implementation from codeSystem.Int32code.p  pBack to origins, under these circumstances how does this come to the result that System.Int32 is the backing type for codeSystem.Enumcodep  pCan anyone explainp  pRegards.p

Negative 669 pIm not at my first express.js application, although I have still to figure out the most robust way to handle errors.p  pSince io.js is reality from a couple months Im using native Promises to help myself with asyncronicity, the following code reflects that.p  pMy errorhandling middleware is as followingp  precoderouter.usefunction err, req, res, next     in case err.custom is present, means is an handled Error, created by developers   if err.custom      return res.statuserr.code.jsonerr.message       if err instanceof Error      console.errorerr.stack     return res.status500.sendRuntime Error  should be reported       last but not least, validation error   res.status400.senderr  codepre  pAn example controller is written like thisp  precodefunction callService1 param1    return new Promisefunction resolve, reject      service.callparam1, function err, data        if err return rejecterr  this is an Error object not sure        if data.handledError   this is an handled Error to the user, not 500         return reject custom true, status 403, message service1 tells you that myCoolParam is not valid               resolvedata           function callService2 dataFromParam1    return new Promisefunction resolve, reject       something here       this is the API controller module.exports  function req, res, next    callService1req.body.myCoolParam   .thencallService2   .thenfunction service2Output      res.status200.json message everything went smooth       .catchnext  here is the catchall errors  codepre  pAs you can see the express middleware looks quite tidy and elegant.br I usually handle all the interesting errors to the user in the coderejectscode, some of them are called with an object where I tell the errorhandling middleware.p  pThe problem is codeservicecode from the example is a 3rdparty library. Those libraries some times returns a string, sometime an object from an external API, sometimes a javascript Error.p  pCurrently I cannot handle custom javascript Objects, moreover if I want to throw an error 500 to the user I have to do coderejectnew Errorerrcode but sometimes this codeerrcode is an object, resulting inp  precodeError [object Object]     at errorHandler awesomeapipostsomething.js12316     at IncomingMessage.ltanonymousgt nodemodulesmandrillapimandrill.js8324     at emitNone events.js7220     at IncomingMessage.emit events.js1637     at streamreadable.js89116     at process.tickCallback node.js33711 codepre  pThis is not cool at all, and I would really like to figure out a way to handle gracefully those errors, without adding code if possible, since I find this syntax quite elegant and concise.p

Negative 669 pI have an android app in which i execute some task every 24 hours a day. For that I have registered a service and it runs first time and I have also used codeTimercode class in it to execute my method after a fix interval.

Negative 669 pThe question is simple in a typical emdynamic programmingem solution, how can one print the actual states that were traversed during computation of the final solutionp  pLet me try to explain with the help of an example what exactly I needp  pSuppose, we have a codeDPcode solution to a problem where each state will have twodimensions i.e. a state in the solution will look like codei,jcode. Now, we have a emstarting stateem code0,0code and some emfinal statesem codei,ncode, where codeicode varies from 0 to n. p  pSo, a typical solution will work like thisp  precodeStart from a starting state in this case gt 0,0 Move to the next state based on some computation suppose from 0,0, we could go to 1,0, 1,1 or 1,2. . . Keep on traversing until we reach one of the end states in this case i,n, for any i. codepre  pNow, I need to print the path traversed in this solution. Basically, if I can find out from which state I reached the emfinal stateem, I can use that logic to go back upto the emstarting stateem and consequently print the path.p  pP.S. Apologies if the question seems too obvious.p

Negative 669 pPlease forgive my lousy terminologyp  pIve been struggling with a problem for some time now.p  pIm making a gameengine in java where I constantly encounter the same problem. Ive got this class hierarchyp  pPARENT  CHILD  GRANDCHILDp  pwhere PARENT owns and constructs CHILD and so forth.p  pNow, the parent has the ability to do stuff that both CHILD and GRANDCHILD needs to do during execution. Lets say that GRANDCHILD is a button in the GUI and PARENT is the CORE of the game. If the button is pushed I want to pause the game. The buttonGRANDCHILD has no means of doing this itself, but needs to do it through the PARENTCORE.p  pPARENT             CHILD           GRANDCHILD  pause game         do somethingp  pIve got three solutions to this problem, none which satisfies me.p  ol liReturn values. PARENTGAMECORE feels that the mouse has been pressed, calls CHILD, which calls GRANDCHILD. GRANDCHILD acknowledges that its been pressed and returns an int, or enum to the PARENTCORE. The PARENTCORE uses and caseifelse to determine what needs to be done.li ol  pPARENT intclick CHILD intclick  GRANCHILD intclickp  pPARENTS functionp  precodeswitchCHILD.click case 1 do this case 2 do that etc.  codepre  pThis is the solution that I hate the most. Not only do I need to keep track of ints enums, but I also need to use switchifelse when I could use polymorphism to get cleaner code.p  ol start2 lipI think this method is called callback. Upon construction PARENT sends an inner classa bundle of functions, which is passed down to the constructor of the GRANDCHILD. The GRANDCHILD saves this inner class instance and invokes its methods when it needs to.p  pclass PARENT p  pCHILD childp  pPARENT child  new CHILDnew Controller p  pclass Controllerp  ppublic void click do stuff... p  pp  ppli ol  pThis is ok, but doesnt feel right. The gamecore might have hundreds of CHILDREN and that means hundred of inner classes, which functions might do more or less the same thing. Classes will become huge when as the game grows. This also creates cycles in the hierarchy, and I have a feeling thats bad.p  ol start3 liI think this is called services. PARENTGAMECORE is public. Any class can invoke its methods. Well, in the case PARENTCHILDGRANDCHILD, both PARENT and CHILD needs to be public, since GRANDCHILD needs both CHILDs methods and PARENTS. This doesnt feel too good.li ol  pI could live with this if there only was a handful of classes that needed to be accessible. Problem is that I need intercommunication all the time, by everyone, almostp  pSo what can I do Have I missed something, and if not, what of the above is the best practise and will save me from future headachesp

Negative 669 pHi I hope the master of Stack overflow can assist me on this one.p  pSo heres the thing. For some reason our dev deployment is done by copying an updated dll file to the assembly by dragging and dropping it to the CWindowsAssembly folder.p  pI tried to create a batch script that contains the following code xcopy dsourcesample.dll cWindowsAssemblyp  pbut this seems to not work. I was told it is because dragging dll in the assembly folder does not copy it but installs it.p  pIs there a way to do this using a batch we do this like 20 times per day so its really time consuming to do this evertime. Hope someone helps.p

That becomes complicated for complex plotting functions. It would be nice to have an approach that allows to store a file code.RDatacode or code.pdfcode, ... which contains an image against you could compare in future tests. The codemd5sumcode approach isnt working because the md5sums differ on different platforms. Via coderecordPlotcode you could create an code.RDatacode file but you could not rely on its format from the coderecordPlotcode manual pagep  blockquote   pThe format of recorded plots may change between R versions.        Recorded plots can emnotem be used as a permanent storage format for        R plots. p blockquote  pMaybe it would be possible to store an image file code.pngcode, code.bmpcode, etc, import it and compare it pixel by pixel ...p  pemEDIT2em The following code illustrate the desired reference file approach using svg as output.

Negative 669 pIm working on a project that requires a very complex maven build. p  pOne swc we use is just for native Flash assets. All our assets are versioned separately in another git repo so I just want maven to include it as a local lib. p  pUntil now we have been continuously uploading the swc to artifactory with each change and versioning it there. As all assets are versioned separately anyway this is a superphlues and arbitrary system.p  pI would just like to have it in a local lib folder and not be versioned through maven.

Im trying to invalidate cache objects through PURGE requests initiated from NodeJS.p  pMy testing consists of requesting the object, letting it cache, then do a purge request, then request it again resulting in a fetch, and then request it again resulting in a hit of the refreshed cache object.p  pWhen I test this through the Firefox debug console, it works fine. All steps seem to work as expected. When I test the entire process in NodeJS, it works as expected, just fine. However, when I let the object cache through Firefox, and then try to invalidate it through NodeJS, it reports a 404 Not in cache.p  pIm a 100 sure Im using the same URI, and I have no idea why it acts this way. Has anyone else experienced this problem And if yes, what is the solution to this problemp  pThis is my VCLp  precodebackend default    .host  127.0.0.1   .port  80   acl purge          localhost         loadbalancerip   sub vclrecv       if req.request  PURGE              ifclient.ip  purge                      error 405 Not allowed.                          return lookup      else if req.url  i.jpegjpgpnggificojscssxml              unset req.http.Cookie             return lookup      else              return pass        sub vclhit      if req.request  PURGE              set obj.ttl  0s             error 200 Purged        sub vclmiss      if req.request  PURGE              error 404 Not in cache.         sub vclfetch      if req.url  i.jpegjpgpnggificojscssxml              unset beresp.http.setcookie             return deliver        sub vcldeliver      if obj.hits gt 0              set resp.http.XCache  HIT      else              set resp.http.XCache  MISS       codepre  pAs you can see, my configuration is pretty straight forward.

Negative 669 pIm developing a basic application to load and modify molecules and my main goal is to implement Kinect to do it. So far Ive been able to do it with a mouse and I would like to do it with my right hand. After searching for a while I tried to define my cursor in a screen environment like if it would be done with a mouse Input.mousePosition.x substituting this for the hands coordinates normalized for the screen dimensions. I cant make the cursor follow my hand, but I can make a game object follow any part of my body so my coordinates are being imported and when I debug my control variables they return a value contained in the screen dimensions.

Actually, strictly speaking, its not a register at all since it does not record sales. It just assists with the calculations. The device supports customer transactions in the following way  Ready to ring up a customers purchases, the running total is initially zero.  As the operative enters the price of each item the running total is updated.  Once the final item has been added, requesting payment, the operator may enter the amount tendered. This causes the cash drawer to open along with the calculation of the change that is due.  Having received payment and obtained change as required, closing the cash drawer serves to complete the transaction, setting the running total, amount tendered and change due back to zero.  The running total may be examined at any point.  A transaction can be cancelled at any point. All values stored by the register revert to zero. An Acme cash register simulator is required. Here is sample IO for the program Cash Register Running total R0.00 1. Ring up item. 2. Enter amount tendered. 3. New transaction. 4. Quit 1 Enter amount 34.50 Running total R34.50 1. Ring up item. 2. Enter amount tendered. 3. New transaction. 4. Quit 2 CONTINUED Enter amount 50 Running total R34.50 Amount tendered R50.00 Change due R15.50 1. Ring up item. 2. Enter amount tendered. 3. New transaction. 4. Quit 3 Running total R0.00 1. Ring up item. 2. Enter amount tendered. 3. New transaction. 4. Quit 4 Design and implement a CashRegister class that models Acme cash register function, and then write a program called RegisterUI that uses a CashRegister object, providing IO. Use the design of the meterology program of question 3 to guide you The CashRegister class should contain methods for each register function. The RegisterUI class should be responsible for creating a CashRegister object, obtaining user input, calling the CashRegister objects methods, and printing results. The CashRegister class should NOT contain any print statements. codepre

Negative 669 pI usually use codeConsole.ReadLinecode to capture a single keystroke. But this function blocks execution and keeps waiting for it to happen.p  pIs it possible, inside a loop, to capture it if its pressed and continue execution if its notp  pThe best would be something similar to GUI apps, that keep running and anytime a shortcut is executed its intercepted and an event throws to be captured. But I doubt console apps are able to do that.p  pThe second best solution would be a codeConsole.ReadLinecode that waits for 1 second and then returns. If user is holding a keyboard button while the function is called, the function identifies the keystroke and returns with its char, otherwise the function returns with null.p

Negative 669 pI know this might be a silly question but I have really gone through so many materiel and links but still not quite understand it. In the Supporting Multiple Screens section of Android Develop Doc, it introduces dp like thisp  blockquote   h2Densityindependent pixel dph2      pA virtual pixel unit that you should use when defining UI layout, to express layout dimensions or position in a densityindependent way. The densityindependent pixel is equivalent to one physical pixel on a 160 dpi screen, which is the baseline density assumed by the system for a medium density screen. At runtime, the system transparently handles any scaling of the dp units, as necessary, based on the actual density of the screen in use. strongThe conversion of dp units to screen pixels is simple px  dp  dpi  160. For example, on a 240 dpi screen, 1 dp equals 1.5 physical pixels.strong You should always use dp units when defining your applications UI, to ensure proper display of your UI on screens with different densities. p blockquote  pBasically I understand the fact that screen with higher dpi would have more pixels in a single physical inch, which means stronga dp in such a screen would equal more physical pixelspxstrong. p  pBut according to the above conversion equation in bold font, in a screen with higher dpi e.g. 240 dpi screen , a strongpx  240  160  dp  1.5dpstrong. This seems to mean that in higher dpi screen stronga px would equal more dpstrong. This looks in conflict with my previous understanding.p  pSo, please, could anyone help me to figure this tricky issue out. Thank you a lot, really.p

Negative 669 pI am using codeWindows Workflow Foundation 4codeand as part of more complicated scenario I have those two statesp  pa hrefhttpi.stack.imgur.comm271C.png relnofollowimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comm271C.png altStatesap  pThe idea is that the users are allowed to upload files which is part of the whole workflow. There may be several reason which my lead to the fact that an uploaded file can not be processed immediately. One of the reasons may be that currently there is a file uploaded from a certain user which is being processed so every other file uploaded during the processing should be in state codeWaitingProcessingcode. However when I enter the codeWaitingProcessingcode state I need to check this. In order to do that I have to implement something like thisp  pa hrefhttpi.stack.imgur.comJpfdi.png relnofollowimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comJpfdi.png altDetailed stateap  pwhere generally the codeHasFileToProcesscode is a function which will call a stored procedure from the database to check if currently there is a file for this user which is in state codeProcessingcode.p  pAlmost all parts of the tasks are clear, one thing that I dont know how to do is how to call e function inside the condition field. In fact I have almost zero experience with codeWindows Workflowcode at all so Im not even sure that this is the way to go so as a subquestion I would appreciate if someone knows and show me if there is better way to implement this kind of logic.p

Negative 669 pUsing codeopenpyxlcode Ive been able to get all the code in place to read .xlsx tables to generate .xml needed for a specific technical document tool. Im trying to make the code general to work for just about any table someone on my team may generate and one issue that has bitten me is that some columns in the XML have formatting applied to save some typing. p  pFor example, I have a table with a column for the line ID and the text, in Excel, reads as Test001, Test002, Test003, etc. To save typing, Ive set up a custom number format in Excel as Test000, allowing someone to type  any of the columns cells and have it convert to the Test. The value returned when reading the cell value with codeopenpyxlcode returning .p  pShort of checking the numberformat on every column and using a regular expression to extract the string and add it to the read value, is there a trivial way with codeopenpyxlcode 2.2.6 to have the the value return what is seen by the Excel user  p  pThat would greatly generalize my code, as some tables might not have the ID column.p  pHere is a minimum working example of the pythonp  precodeimport openpyxl import logging logging.basicConfiglevellogging.DEBUG, format asctimes  levelnames  messages  if name  main     logging.infoReading from ExampleWrkBook.xlsx     wb  openpyxl.loadworkbookExampleWrkBook.xlsx     wrkSheet  wb.getsheetbynameSheet1     logging.infoThe first ID value in the sheet is TestID001, but openpyxl returns 0s.formatstrwrkSheet[B3].value codepre  pAnd an example spreadsheet can be found on DropBox a hrefhttpsdl.dropboxusercontent.comu10370671ExampleWrkBook.xlsx relnofollowherea.p

Negative 669 pI am thinking of using the new strongjava 8 Date Time APIstrong. I googled a bit and found jodaTime as good choice for java but still kind of interested to see how this new API works. p  pI am storing all time in UTC values in my datastore and will be converting them to Local Time Zone specific value based on users timezone. I can find many articles showing how to use new Java Date Time API. However I am not sure if the API will take care of DST changes   Or do we have any better way of handling Date p  pI am just learning the new Date API , so thought of hearing your thoughts on handling the DateTime and displaying it on the basis of Users TimeZone.p
Negative 669 pI have a SQL Server 2012 stored procedure that returns a table. I have to modify that SP to add an additional value to the returned table. Unfortunately, that added value comes from a call to a webservice. From my research, I gather the main ways to do this are using the OLE Automation procedures spOA... in SQL, or a SQLCLR stored procedure. Given the security context in which the spOA... procedures run, the single return value is a VARCHAR10 registration key, and calls to the service are few ten to twenty per hour, Im guessing the SQLCLR method is the way to go. Also, the webservice is hosted on our intranet, and not accessible to the outside world. p  pIs there a better way to accomplish what I need Better meaning more performant, better security, easier to code and maintainp
