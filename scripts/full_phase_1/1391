Positive 1391 pI found a clever bit of code in the site Im working on that uses hex values to store an array of toggleable variables. p  pFor example, D in hex being 1101 in binary, means the first toggle is one, the second is off, and the third and fourth are on. p  pI looked at unpack, but either I didnt understand it or its not the right function for me. I also considered splitting the whole thing character by character and then sending each character through a switch that then drops values into an array, but that seems way too cumbersome and inelegant. p  pSo, how do I turn a string of hexbased characters into an ordered array of Boolean valuesp

Negative 1391 pThe .net framework 4 is apparently going to include a BigInteger class. However, I cant seem to find out whether or not it will be immutable. I also cant seem to decide whether or not that would be a good thing.p  pImmutability has a ton of benefits, especially for something as valuelike as a bigint. On the other hand, the basic operations have to be efficient in order to make highcost operations like PowerMod as speedy as possible.

Negative 1391 pI am really new to Haskell Actually I saw Real World Haskell from OReilly and thought hmm, I think Ill learn functional programming yesterday and I am wondering I can use the construct operator to add an item to the beginning of a listp  precode1  [2,3] [1,2,3] codepre  pI tried making an example data type I found in the book and then playing with itp  precodein a file data BillingInfo  CreditCard Int String String  CashOnDelivery  Invoice Int deriving Show  in ghci   let orderlist  [Invoice 2345]   orderlist [Invoice 2345]   let orderlist  CashOnDelivery  orderlist   orderlist [CashOnDelivery, CashOnDelivery, CashOnDelivery, CashOnDelivery, CashOnDelivery, CashOnDelivery, CashOnDelivery, CashOnDelivery, CashOnDelivery, CashOnDelivery, CashOnDelivery, CashOnDelivery, CashOnDelivery, CashOnDelivery, ... codepre  petc... it just repeats forever, is this because it uses ilazyi evaluationp  pb EDIT bp  pokay, so it is being pounded into my head that let orderlist  CashOnDeliveryorderlist doesnt add CashOnDelivery to the original orderlist and then set the result to orderlist, but instead is recursive and creates an infinite list, forever adding CashOnDelivery to the beginning of itself. Of course now I remember that Haskell is a functional language and I cant change the value of the original orderlist, so what should I do for a simple tack this on to the end or beginning, whatever of this list Make a function which takes a list and BillingInfo as arguments, and then return a listp  pb EDIT 2 bp  pwell, based on all the answers Im getting and the lack of being able to pass an object by reference and mutate variables such as Im used to... I think that I have just asked this question prematurely and that I really need to delve further into the functional paradigm before I can expect to really understand the answers to my questions... I guess what i was looking for was how to write a function or something, taking a list and an item, and returning a list under the same name so the function could be called more than once, without changing the name every time as if it was actually a program which would add actual orders to an order list, and the user wouldnt have to think of a new name for the list each time, but rather append an item to the same list. p
Negative 1391 pI have just started at a new job. Here we are new to using JNI  for bridging C  Java . I am new to JNI so please forgive my noobness p  pIn our win32 Java app we are loading a C DLL. On the Java side we have several instances of SomeJClass each of these instances needs access to corresponding instance of SomeCClass on the DLL side.  The DLL exposes entrypoints such as GlobalDoSomethingInC. Here I must call the instance method of DoerDoSomethingInC.  So I need a smooth way to map the respective thispointers. I also need to do the same mapping when a DLL thread discovers something interesting that it needs to notify the corresponding Javainstance of. p  pI can think of several solutions, but I do not like them too much. My question is, is there a better way than this p  p1 Java calls CGetNewInstance. This returns an int that is actually a pointer to the new C instance. Java stores it in mmyCInstance. Then Java calls GlobalDoSomethingInC, and 1a p  precode DLL global void GlobalDoSomethingInC       retrive this pointer     calling back to Java       jobj tmpJ  NewGlobalRef env, obj      Doer myDoer  ltreinterpretcastgt Doer tmpJgtGetMyCInstance     myDoergtDoSomething     DeleteGlobalRef env, tmpJ       Arrrrgh  codepre  p1b orp  precode     for every call that Java adds a parameter,      which is the stored intmmyCInstance, and     Doer myDoer  ltreinterpretcastgt Doer instanceParamgtDoSomethingInC      Can we do better that this codepre  p2 For calling from C to Java, things look, maybe, betterp  precodeIn the constructor C calls back into Java and stores the Java instance reference      in a member variable. mmyJInstance.

Negative 1391 pIs there a way to make the selectionchanged event fire every time a selection in the listview is clicked, instead of only when it changesp  pFor example, lets say i have a listview with only one object in it. The user clicks that object, and that object contains information that populates some textboxes below. The user starts changing some of the values in these textboxes which are not bound to the object. They then decide that they dont want what is in those text boxes so theyd like to reset everything to what is in the object in the listview. But when they click the one object in the listview, nothing happens, because the selection has not changed.p  pHope that makes sense. Anyone know how I can get around thisp

Negative 1391 pCommonly, a website has a menu bar with links to different pages of the site Home, Page A, Page B, etc..p  pLets say you have a site with address ema hrefhttpwww.example.com relnofollowhttpwww.example.comaem. 99 when someone types that URL into their browser, they are directed to the page represented by Home. It usually has the optional extension of index[.html.php] e.g., ema hrefhttpwww.example.comindex.html relnofollowhttpwww.example.comindex.htmlaem. However, there are use cases where, depending from where a user is going to hit your website, that you want to redirect them to a different page. For example, if you have an ad on a site promoting your page, you might want to redirect them to ema hrefhttpwww.example.comcamefromad.html relnofollowhttpwww.example.comcamefromad.htmlaem which will look pretty much the same as your normal Home page, but maybe with a little added text specifying that they came from the page where the ad was on.p  pMy question isp  pIs there a way, after a user has landed on the site from a referred page, to use PHP to ensure that clicking the Home link will always go to ema hrefhttpwww.example.comcamefromad.html relnofollowhttpwww.example.comcamefromad.htmlaem emIFem the user landed there to begin with What I am trying to avoid is for a user to have come to ema hrefhttpwww.example.comcamefromad.html relnofollowhttpwww.example.comcamefromad.htmlaem and then click Home in the menu bar and end up at the default home page never to be able to return to the ema hrefhttpwww.example.comcamefromad.html relnofollowhttpwww.example.comcamefromad.htmlaem page I dont have that landing page enabled in the public menu since I dont want the general user to be able to go there.p  pThis is my first time using PHP and I am trying to piece it together using session state, etc., but I just havent quite completed the puzzle yet. Here is what I have in emindex.phpem which is the file that represents the Home linkp  precodelt sessionstart  SESSION[amSet] 0 gt  lt if SESSION[amSet]  0    if emptySERVER[HTTPREFERER]      referrer  SERVER[HTTPREFERER]     SESSION[amSet]  1     if pregmatchother.example.net,referrer     headerLocation httpexample.comcamefromad.html  gt codepre  pBasically, my thinking is to set a variable when the user comes to the site so that the referrer variable is set to that referring site. But if the user clicks around links in the site itself, I dont want the referrer reset. I want it to stay what it was when the user first came to the site, so if the user clicks on the Home link it will always refer the user to the appropriate page. Obviously, the code I have above is not working.p

Negative 1391 pI run into design choices like this often and struggle a bit Im looking for some other perspectives.p  pI often want to keep lists of, or pass around chunks of state that are basically just sets of values. The values tend to be primitive types floats, NSTimeIntervals, CGPoints, etc.p  pMy first inclination is often to create C structures for these sets of properties, e.g.p  precodetypedef struct STATE      float foo     NSTimeInterval elapsed     CGPoint point  STATE codepre  petc.p  pBut C structures dont play nicely with the native Cocoa collection classes codeNSArraycode, codeNSSetcode, codeNSDictionarycode, and using overmany of them to track lots of state feels like it runs against the grain of rest of my Cocoafriendly code I end up having and directly managing arrays of structs, and passing struct pointers around in messages, etc.p  pOn the other hand, since raw performance isnt necessarily critical, I could encode these values into a NSDictionary, wrapping them all in codeNSValuecode or codeNSNumbercode, but the resulting syntax is hardly terse, and a little fragile, requiring type and name correctness at runtime for both the insert and the lookupp  precode[stateDict setObject[NSNumber numberWithFloatfoo] forKeybar] ...  float something  [[stateDict objectForKeybar] floatValue] codepre  pand some types, like NSTimeInterval, are only able to be used with some arguable hackery typecast to double in that case.p  pFinally, I could create dataonly container objects, with private member data and only getterssetters. These would be called beans in Java. These are more terse to access than dictionaries, more Cocoa than structs, but feel like overkill to me, especially if I only need them as inner classes that are used for state management internal to a single object type.p  pHow do you, great Cocoa programming public, do thisp

Negative 1391 pI am trying to change the selected option in a select dropdown box with jQuery. I have it set so that it finds the hash tag at the end of the URL and based on that hash tag it changes the selected option in the select box.p  pMost of my code is functional, it successfully finds the hash tag and executes the if statement that corresponds with it. However, when it goes to execute the then section of the statement when it goes to the selector for the option which uses an attribute selector based on the value attribute of the option tag it returns null.

Negative 1391 pFirst of all thanks for taking the time to read my question. Here is what I am trying to accomplish followed by what I have so far on this.p  pWhat I want to do is create a Windows application or server of sorts that would listen for requests from an ASP.NET application. The windows application would be installed and would listen for messages from ASP.NET application and then do some processing. The flow is like thisp  pA user downloads the desktop application and registers their IP address on my web site. After downloading the desktop app, the ASP.NET application can then send requests to that particular desktop client for further processing. I think further processing is independent of the resolution in this case thats why i have skipped over details on what processing would be done. But if you think it is important, please let me know and I will add those details as well.p  pI have looked into creating a TCP server that would listen for requests. Because the user has already registered their IP address on my web site, my web site assigns them a unique identifier and stores the ID alongwith IP address in database. Now, the ASP.NET site can send requests to that desktop application.p  pI have looked into creating a TCP server for this purpose. While researching I also came across PNRP and it seems something like what I am trying to do. p  pCan you guys recommend some solutions or where I should be looking at for this scenario Should I create a simple TCPLISTENER or may be go with PNRP approach Or something elsep  pThe basic requirement is for a web application to be able to communicate with a desktop application. The web application would be servicing numerous users and each user would have a desktop application installed. Which user for which desktop client question would be addressed by the web application that would maintain a database of unique user ids and their corresponding IP Address.p  pThanks in advance for your help.p
Negative 1391 pI knew how to do this but forgot again... Quite irritating, because Im working on a class that contains a list of XML files, and now I just want to use a forin loop to walk through all files in this list.

Basically, the TXmlFileList class allows me to simply refer to XmlFileList[I] to get the file at position I. Works nicely. p  pBut now I want to loop through the TXmlFileList.TItem elements, so I have to expose the TXmlFileList.TItem class. Its not enough, though. It needs an enumerator too in the TXmlFileList classbr How to create that enumeratorbr br br br Youre probably wondering why I use this complex construction. Well, it might be complex but it will be used by some other developers and I dont want to provide more methods than they need. This way, I only give them the methods Add, Clear and Count to loop through the list, and any property defined on the TItem itself. They dont need more than this, although I might add a few more features later on...p
Negative 1391 pI am using multiple ui themes in one page. I create a custom theme with a codecsscode scope, lets say codescopecode.

Negative 1391 pIve been having a real issue trying to make Rpy2 play nice with my R install. I first tried installing the rpy2 MSI package, and this didnt appear to work. When I ran the recommended tests, it was giving me an error saying that it couldnt find the R.dll, because the new R installs post 2.11 install the DLLs into an i386 folder, where rpy2 cant find them because its looking in the bin folder instead of the bini386 folder.p  pThen I tried to build the install from scratch myself using the command line tools distutils included with python. This didnt work, because setup.py claimed to be unable to find the Rhome location. But I did work out that editing an environment variable PATH might show the rpy2 setup where to find the R installation. I then made a couple of edits to the environment, adding the Rhome variable pointing to the bini386 directory, and made a new entry under the PATH variable, pointing to the same spot.p  pUnfortunately, when it found the R path, I got this issue insteadp  precoderunning build running buildpy running buildext Traceback most recent call last   File setup.py, line 372, in ltmodulegt     [os.path.joindoc, source, rpy2logo.png]]   File CPython26libdistutilscore.py, line 152, in setup     dist.runcommands   File CPython26libdistutilsdist.py, line 975, in runcommands     self.runcommandcmd   File CPython26libdistutilsdist.py, line 995, in runcommand     cmdobj.run   File CPython26libdistutilscommandbuild.py, line 134, in run     self.runcommandcmdname   File CPython26libdistutilscmd.py, line 333, in runcommand     self.distribution.runcommandcommand   File CPython26libdistutilsdist.py, line 994, in runcommand     cmdobj.ensurefinalized   File CPython26libdistutilscmd.py, line 117, in ensurefinalized     self.finalizeoptions   File setup.py, line 111, in finalizeoptions     config  getrconfigrhome, about   File setup.py, line 264, in getrconfig     rc  RConfig.fromstringrconfig   File setup.py, line 252, in fromstring      nin stringn  string ValueError Invalid substring in string codepre  pSo I went back to trying to use the premade install, thinking that maybe the new edits to the environment might work but got this issue here p  precode Traceback most recent call last       File ltstringgt, line 245, in runnodebug       File CDocuments and SettingsUserDesktoprpy22.1.9rpytests.py, line 3, in ltmodulegt         import rpy2.robjects.tests       File CPython26libsitepackagesrpy2robjectsinit.py, line 12, in ltmodulegt         import rpy2.rinterface as rinterface       File CPython26libsitepackagesrpy2rinterfaceinit.py, line 56, in ltmodulegt         raise RuntimeErrorUnable to locate R.dll within s  RHOME     RuntimeError Unable to locate R.dll within CProgram FilesRR2.12.1bini386 codepre  pThis is REALLY weird, because as anyone can check on their own install R installs R.dll into CProgram FilesRR2.12.1bini386 and Ive checked and verified that its in there, and Ive pointed rpy2 to this directory in the windows default PATH I know for a fact that rpy2 is looking in the right place, but cant understand why its not seeing R.dll.p  pSo why cant rpy2 find it And does anyone know a way to get rpy2 working with R 2.12 Perhaps I should try the newer rpy2 2.2.0 version Its still in development though, and 1.9 is supposed to be able to handle R 2.12 according to this a hrefhttprpy.sourceforge.netrpy2doc2.2htmloverview.htmlrequirementswebsitea so I dont know what to do...p  pThanks to anyone who can help out...p  p[EDIT] Ive also tried these instructions over a hrefhttpwww.mailarchive.comrpylistlists.sourceforge.netmsg02817.htmlherea but they return the same cant find DLL error...

Negative 1391 pIm trying to write a small function to have GDB asses what a ASM command does, given 2 variables initial value and end value. Essentially im trying to get gdb to do sis until it hits a command that does what im looking for. So say for example, I am looking for the next command that adds 1 to 34. I know that I could manually go through and print out the instructions and go si, but I would rather, if its possible, create a function that looks at the ASM instruction, and then stops if it finds a command that is doing that. So assuming my command that matches is ADD R1, R2, R3 and im looking for inital value of 24 and final value of 55, if R224 and R331 and I know the command is add, that would be my que to stop. Im thinking that if I could get gdb to break apart the xi command I could easily get it to do it, since it could separate the ADD, R1, R2, and R3 I could asses it in my own function by a  ifR2R3 Problem is, I cant get GDB to break that xi string apart.. and im thinking maybe it has to pass it out of GDB somehow to a external program. If anyone has any ideas im all ears.p

Negative 1391 pIve been making some objects using the pimpl idiom, but Im not sure whether to used a hrefhttpen.cppreference.comwcppmemorysharedptrcodestdsharedptrcodea or a hrefhttpen.cppreference.comwcppmemoryuniqueptrcodestduniqueptrcodea. p  pI understand uniqueptr is more efficient, but this isnt so much of an issue for me, as these objects are relatively heavyweight anyway so the cost of codestdsharedptrcode over codestduniqueptrcode is relatively minor.p  pIm currently going with codestdsharedptrcode just because of the extra flexibility. For example, using a codestdsharedptrcode allows me to store these objects in say a hashmap for quick access whilst still being able to return copies of these objects to callers as I believe any iterators or references may quickly become invalid.p  pHowever, these objects in a way really arent being copied, as changes affect all copies, so I was wondering that perhaps using codestdsharedptrcode and allowing copies is some sort of antipattern or bad thing.p  pAny thoughtsp

Negative 1391 pIn mi application im using ServiceLoader to load modulesclasses from .jar file with diferents ClassLoaders in order to completely unload them when not needed from the context of the application and from the JVM itself. I know maybe is not a common topic unload classes from JVM, there are some conditions for that to happen, so i am making the necesary effort. To make sure if all is working like expected im tracing the load and unload of classes with XXTraceClassLoading and XXTraceClassUnloading, the info from this parameters shows me that i can do a complete unload of any module from mi app and from the JVM itself unload from the JVM happens during a complete GC. All this seems to work fine... but mi question is why the .jar files from where the module classes was loaded are keep open by the JVM, that .jars cant be removed but the JVM says to have unloaded the classes from them. Obiusly this is during JVM execution, but why keep open that .jar files if the JVM has no class loaded from them, there is any thing i can do to force the JVM to free that .jar filesp

Negative 1391 pIm designing a UI manager class that will manage all my UI elements this is for an XNA game, so there is no existing UI framework but Im wondering how to deal with situations where I want the UI manager to have special access to data in the UI elements that other classes cant access.p  pFor example, I want to have a SetFocus method to focus a specific element and this method needs to ensure that the previously focused element loses focus.  The individual UI elements themselves cant handle this because they dont have access to the list of UI elements, which means the manager has to handle it, but how can I allow the manager and emonlyem the manager to set the variable on a UI elementp  pThe thought occurs to me to just store the currently focused element on the manager, however I dont particularly like that solution and, given a single UI element, I would like to query it to find out if it has focus.  Even if it makes sense to store the currently focused element on the manager since its just a single variable, there are other things I need to deal with that would require arrays to associate the data with the elements if its stored on the manager, and that just seems to defeat the purpose of OOP.p  pI know I dont emneedem to have it so that the manager is the only one with access to this data, I could just make all the data public, but thats not good design...p
Negative 1391 pI wrote a simple file transfer program that runs on Windows 7. I run this program as a server on one computer and client on the other. Client sends out a request for a file transfer and then server sends out the name of the file first. Then, client acknowledges that it got the file name and to send the content of the file. p  pThis program worked flawlessly on XP. Now we are trying to run it on Windows 7 computers and it has problem. The problem is whenever the server replies back with the filename to the client. p  pServer sends text by calling ServerSocket1.SendTextFile1.dat.p  pWhat the client gets looks like either Chinese or Vietnamese characters. So, my program fails. My client program has to know the name of the file. So, it knows where to save it in specific location in hardrive.p  pI think, SendText function takes AnsiString and What I am sending is string data.

Negative 1391 pI am using emPHPem, emZend Frameworkem and ZendTranslate gettext adapter. To edit translations I use emPOEditem which utilizes emxgettextem to fetch strings to be translated.p  pPOEdit xgettext will search for keywords to find strings to translate. So, if searching for the keyword codetranslatecode, POEdit will have no problem finding the codeText to translatecode string when the text is passed to the translate function directly likep  precodeecho translateText to translate codepre  pBut, in ofther cases strings will be passed to Zend functions that will do the translation for me, calling the translate function with a variable as a parameterp  precodefunction SomeZendFunction array       return translate array[string]    ...  echo SomeZendFunction arraystringgtAnother text to translate   translateAnother text to translate codepre  pThis will cause POEdit xgettext to fail finding the string to translate. In the above example the string I wanted POEdit to find is codeAnother text to translatecode, but since it is not passed directly to the codetranslatecode function, it will not be found.p  pSo, how to solve the problemp  pMy current solution is to create a dummy file containing a long list of all the strings that was not found by POEditp  precodeltphp  Dummy file, only accessed by POEdit when scanning for strings to translate translateText to translate translateAnother text to translate translateA third text to translate .... codepre  pBut the downside of this solution is that when updating a string, I both need to change the dummy file and find the original string. This will make it more hard to maintain.p  pAnother solution I thought of was adding the translation string to a comment after calling codeSomeZendFunctioncode See the above example, but I fail to make xgettext accept it as it ignores comments.p  pSo, anyone knows how to make xgettext to accept strings within comments Or anyone has any other solution that might be betterp  pThanks for any helpp  pstrongEditstrongp  pI dont know for what reason I was down voted.

Sometimes i want a form to be called via ajax and then obviously process it via ajax, too.

Basically what i want to achieve is the followingp  ol liCall the form via ajax that i can do, ajaxContext and such, no problemli liProcess the form via ajax, too working, too, jQuery, but the processing result is not what i wantli liThe result should be a json from the object stored to the databaseli ol  pAnd the connection from point 23 is exactly where i have my problems finding resources for on the internet.p  pstrongGuessed Solutionstrong My guess is, that i need to rearrange my Controllers and Formhandling in a way that i dont handle everything inside codeaddActioncode but to have this and codeprocessaddActioncode where addActions only task is to display the form and processadd does the validation and insertion to the database. But even with this model i dont really see how i can do the json output.p  pIm simply stuck a little in my thought. Some Zendwords i should look up would probably be enough for me to find out what i want to achieve, but if someone wants to give me a working example, i wouldnt say no p  pThanks in advancep

Negative 1391 pI see no difference in sub classing the codemodels.managercode object and overriding the codegetquerysetcode method or simply creating a new method in the sub class and using the method.

Negative 1391 pIm stuck inbetween a rock and a hard place with an application I was making.  Basically the program generates a very large datasetits over 10 gigs and exceeds memory on the server and its hard to transfer this dataset from a dictionary to other servers later on.

Any suggestions of how I can troubleshoot or even if this problem is possible to solve One idea I had was although my memory cannot store the entire database I plan to write, I would love for the server to use some memory to process some requests and then maybe write them as memory gets fullright now mysql is using less than 1 of server memory.p  pAs you know my goal, I have no allegiance to any specific type of system so if mysql is not a good solution, I am happy to try another toolI was going to use hbase, but went down the mysql road first.

While the component is running Id like this thread to periodically call codeTestCooperativeLevelcode and reset D3D device if needed.p  pIm doing this since the client application can create several instances of my player, but it is strongly recommended to have only one instance of D3D9 object and device.p  pIve declared a class with static methods and members, whose constructor calls codebeginthreadexcode and starts the thread. p  pHere are the code excerpts WITH ERRORS.p  precode .h class D3DManager      static mutex d3   mutex is my own class, just a wrapper around CriticalSection     static LPDIRECT3D9 gd3d     static LPDIRECT3DDEVICE9 gd3ddev     static D3DPRESENTPARAMETERS gd3dpp     static int gd3dcounter     static HANDLE hthread     static HANDLE exitev     static bool  exitflag     static mutex exitmutex   public     D3DManager     D3DManager      static unsigned int stdcall threadvoid      static void stopvoid                           exitmutex.lock                         exitflag  true                         SetEventexitev                         exitmutex.unlock       static bool exitsignalvoid                          exitmutex.lock                         bool result  exitflag                        exitmutex.unlock                        return exitflag       static void CreateD3DDeviceLPDIRECT3D9amp d3dobj, LPDIRECT3DDEVICE9amp d3ddev     static void DestroyD3DDevicevoid     static void GetSwapChainHWND hwnd, LPDIRECT3DSWAPCHAIN9amp chain     static void released3dvoid     static void LockDevicevoid  d3.lock      static void UnlockDevicevoid  d3.unlock      .cpp                       mutex D3DManagerd3               LPDIRECT3D9 D3DManagergd3d  NULL         LPDIRECT3DDEVICE9 D3DManagergd3ddev  NULL     D3DPRESENTPARAMETERS D3DManagergd3dpp                       int D3DManagergd3dcounter  0                    HANDLE D3DManagerhthread                    HANDLE D3DManagerexitev                     bool  D3DManagerexitflag  false                     mutex D3DManagerexitmutex             this variable will be single and shared by all activeX instances           static D3DManager d3dm       D3DManagerD3DManager               exitev  CreateEventNULL, true, false, NULL         hthread  HANDLEbeginthreadexNULL, 0, thread, NULL, 0, NULL         OutputDebugStringD3DManager thread created handle xn, hthread   my wrapper around OutputDebugString            D3DManagerD3DManager              stop         HRESULT hr  WaitForSingleObjecththread, 1000         if hr  WAITABANDONED              TerminateThreadhthread, 0             released3d                  CloseHandleexitev           unsigned int stdcall D3DManagerthreadvoid                created3d9         whileexitsignal               WaitForSignleObjectexitev, 500              d3.lock              HRESULT hr  gd3ddevgtTestCooperativeLevel              switchhr                   case SOK                       break                  case D3DERRDEVICENOTRESET                          Fill DISPLAYPARAMETERS                       gd3ddevgtReset                       break                  default                       break                            d3.unlock                This text is never seen          OutputDebugStringD3dManagert exit from while loopn               released3d         endthreadex0         return 0      codepre  pMy component is embedded in the WindowsForms form, writtent in C. p  pThe problem is when I close the form, the thread is terminated inside while loop and never gets to the code after it.

Negative 1391 pI have a list populated from a sqlite database with data values ranging from 1 to 1. Is there any way to set the background color for the negative items to red and the positive items to green A similar effect could be had by adding a green up arrow to the item view for positive and a red down arrow image for negative values. Another example might be a todo list with items color coded by a priority value. In ios this would occur in cellforrowat indexpath and on windows phonesilverlight it would be done by binding a dependency property to the data. Can this be achieved with Android p
Negative 1391 pBeen doing quite a bit of research but cant find the answer to this. I have an application which is built up by creating instances derived from QObject that I move to different threads. In these threads I have a QNetworkAccessManager where I do rest request to azure. My issue now is that I have some retry logic that is happening way to quickly. For example, if a container doesnt exists, it needs to be created for the request to be retried put blob. The issue is if the put blob request happens way too quickly after the container was created, it will fail to upload anything. Also, I would like to increase the time between the reties so that they dont happen to quickly after eachother. What is the best way to force a thread to sleep from within itself p

The shadow is barely visible for both of them.p  pI have been using the parameters, shadowDy, shadowDx, etc. I know the shadowRadius is the parameter that actually defines the border size, but I have been experimenting both with values above 1 and below 1, and I cant seem to get any good results. There are minimal changes in size and shadow density, but nothing useful.p  pI have considered another option, which is a last resort, which is drawing the text twice, a bigger black font in the BG and align the character spacing so that the black text becomes the shadow of the white text on the front.p  pThank you in advance p

I was wondering how possible and easy this task will be and which direction I should turn to.  p  pIm not completely clear on the details Ill update when I completely find out, but from my understanding the computer is going to act like its printing the file and the php code is going to grab the message and just display it on a regular web page.  Any help would be much appreciated.   p

Negative 1391 pIm following these tutorials thoroughly and must say theyre great tutorialsp  pa hrefhttpwww.techchorus.netcreaterestfulapplicationsusingzendframework relnofollowhttpwww.techchorus.netcreaterestfulapplicationsusingzendframeworkap  pIm just confused about the whole concept of ZendRest abstract methods. In the examples, you only seep  pindex POST GET PUT DELETEp  pWhile these functions make sense, Im trying to figure out if the whole architecture is only limited to those abstract methods. Im thinking about a use case where a consumer wants to use the API to update specific fields in lets say the user table, or another case where the consumer wants to update activity table. The business logic of these two tables are covered in one RESTful api controller. I would tackle this problem by creating specific updatepost method for each table, and have function parameters to define which fields are being updated. Would this kind of implementation conform with REST and if so how do you go beyond POST,GET, PUT, DELETE methods p

Negative 1391 pIm building a complex application in JavaScript which needs to make several requests to the server.

I would like the ability to have the server inform the application in the requests response that more information is needed and to describe how to retrieve that information. p  pFor example, say a user tries to perform an operation that his current permissions level does not allow. The server needs to ask the application for an override authorization code, basically meaning the application needs to pop up with a dialog asking for an admin passcode. p  pId like to have some kind of framework that abstracts all this.

Negative 1391 pI obviously dont know what Im doing when it comes to parallel programming with .NET 4.0. I have a simple Windows app that starts a task to do some mindless work outputting numbers 11000. I put a substantial pause in half way through to simulate a long running process. While this long pause is taking place, if I hit the Stop button, its event handler calls the Cancel method of CancellationTokenSource. I dont want to do any further processing in this case, outputting a message in the Stop buttons event handler until the canceled task is done with its current iteration. How do I do this I tried using Task.WaitAll, etc in the Stop buttons event handler, but that just throws an unhandled AggregateException. Heres the code which will help explain my problem if run as described abovep  precode  private Task t   private CancellationTokenSource cts    public Form1         InitializeComponent       private void startButtonClickobject sender, EventArgs e         statusTextBox.Text  Output started.

Negative 1391 pI have just started trying to learn how to write apps for iPad. I have experience with C, C and Java, but am very new to Objective C ios in general.p  pI have a custom UIView that draws a number line to the screen and I have some working buttons that trigger methods in this view.p  pWhat I would like to do is have touching the drawn number line call a method in my UIView. More generally, any tap on the background should call this method with it screen coordinates so I can then decide if they touched he right place and what to do.p  pIve been searching for many hours now for info and am going in circles a bit. As far as I can see it is normal to add gesture recognition code to the ViewController instead of the UIView I am having Xcode do as much as possible for me automatically, so only have a very basic understanding of these different parts.p  pThe problem is that all the brains of the program are in the UIView I want to move a drawn arrow to a new tapped location on the number line. But if I have a method in the ViewController responding to a touch event, I cant figure out how to call my UIView methods from within my controller.p  pEasiest would be a method directly in my UIView subclass that was called from the touch event. p  pAll I have done so far is used Xcode to set up a single view application and created one UIView subclass Called FracLine which then draws the number line and an arrow.p  pThanks.p

Negative 1391 pMy simplistic understanding of the Rails stack is that it does the following in generalp  ol liThe input is a HTTP message GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, HEAD, a URL, some optional cookies, a optional session token, and possibly some data packed up in JSON or XML format. li liThis HTTP message is handled by Rack which may run it through a set of middleware functions which add or remove data from the message, and may use the data to add, alter,  or remove data from the programs data store. li liThe HTTP message at the output of Rack is sent to the Rails router, which maps it to a controller, an action, and a params hash with the session information, cookies, and other parameters in it. The data is dispatched to the appropriate controller. li liThe controller method parses the params, and algorithmically combines it with data from the database via models, optionally changes data and then dispatches a set of variables starting with  to a view template. li liThe view template takes the data and merges it with the view template to form a view with the appropriate format eg. HTML, JS, JSON, XML, etc, or it tells the caller via a HTTP return code to redirect to another URL.  li ol  pWhat I would like to do with my Rails web application, using the Rails console is p  ol liCompose a valid HTTP message with URL, session ids, cookies, and encoded data JSON or XML. li liInject this data into the Rack interface, and inspect what comes out before it is sent to the Rails router. li liI would then like to then send that data to the Rails router and see what comes out before it goes to the controller. li liI would then like to send that data to the controller and see what comes out before it is sent to the view template. li liAnd I would then like to take that that data and run it through the view template and have display on STDOUT, or have it automatically open a web browser and see it render. li ol  pAre there any existing Rails tools which can do this If not, can anybody point me to the Rails code where these interfaces occurp

Negative 1391 pAndroid seems be to be increasing the clickable area of a submit button on an HTML form Im working on. Its as if theres about 25 pixels to the right of the submit button that are also tapable. This is problematic because, in my design, to the right of the submit button is an codeltAgtcode element with an event handler bound to it. Tapping the codeltAgtcode often submits the form instead of firing the event handler. Im doing most of my testing in Browerstack and some on real hardware. The problem exhibits in virtual devices with lower screen widths e.g. 320px, and seems to be there in Android 2.3 and 4. The same pages in iPhone 4s, iOS6 and Blackberry v7 dont exhibit the problem.p  pa hrefhttpcodepen.iosimondellpenwltGA relnofollowHeres a CodePen examplea, and a a hrefhttpdemo.expressionworks.co.ukandroidextratargetareaindex.html relnofollowsingle file versiona of the same code for easier viewing on mobilep  pHas anyone else seen this Is it a feature A bug  either in Android or in my codep
Negative 1391 pIm using the latest Facebook iOS SDK, 3.1.1. I want to give users the option to disconnect our app from Facebook. Im callingp  precode[[FBSession activeSession] closeAndClearTokenInformation] codepre  pThat seems to work fine, but the next time I callp  precode[FBSession openActiveSessionWithReadPermissionsallowLoginUIcompletionHandlerhandler] codepre  pit immediately gives me a token, without asking the user to login again. I would expect it to ask the user again to authenticate. If theres no Facebook account set up on the device, it works fine, because it opens the web browser where it tells the user theyve already authenticated the app and shows the Okay button. But if it is set up, it just silently gets the token again and so the users disconnecting the app has no effect.p  pIs anyone else having this issue, and how are you handling itp

Negative 1391 pI would like to know if it is possible to rather have a strongMasonry FadeIn animation, rather than the bricks flying instrong.

Negative 1391 pFrom my understanding, once a form is being submitted, you cannot add parameters to it by adding extra inputs at least this a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions7376205urlparametersnotgettingpassedduringjavascriptsubmit[link]a is what gave me that assumptionp  pFor examplep  precodevar form  form form.submitfunctione    searchForm.append    ltinput namea typehidden value  a  gt     ltinput nameb typehidden value  b  gt   codepre  pSo my next guess would be to dynamically add parameters via location. I followed a hrefhttpstackoverflow.coma487049525576thisa code but that refreshes the page and only works with adding one parameter, and gets ride of my original input on the form. This doesnt work.p  pMaybe what I am trying to do isnt possible with a get but only with a post. Which I dont want to use a post. but to clear things up, as a user I search for a location, when the person submits the search, jquery interferes with codesubmitcode and does look on the address to find a latlng. If a lat and lng exists I want to pass the lat and lng along with the searched address to the next page via get.p  pExamplep  precodewebsite.compathsearchNCampa35.38905ampb78.486328 codepre

Negative 1391 pThere are some ios sip applications who are able to communicate with a UDP only SIP Server. p  pAs I know iOS allows only TCP connection to remain open in the background but most of the SIP providers are supporting only UDP.p  pI have noticed that iOS application 3CXPhone has a NAT helper mode and it is able to keep the communication in background with a 3CX Phone system who is UDP only. Dose anyone know what trick do they use I am developing an SIP app and I have to make it work for the UDP only SIP providers.p  pI know there are multiple questions regarding UDP socket in background on SO but none of them has a useful answer or the solution proposed there dose not work anymore starting from iOS 6.p  pUntil now I am aware of 2 possible solutions 1. Use some GPS events and during that events maintain the socket communication too. After that try to trick apple and get your app in the store. 2. Use a SIP proxy in the middle B2BUA. But in the 3CXPhone NAT helper mode I am not seeing any sip proxy configuration. p

Negative 1391 pIm running into a strange issue or intended where codecombinefirstcode or codeupdatecode are causing values stored as codeboolcode to be upcasted into codefloat64codes if the argument supplied is not supplying the boolean columns.p  pExample workflow in ipythonp  precodeIn [144] test  pd.DataFrame[[1,2,False,True],[4,5,True,False]], columns[a,b,isBool, isBool2]  In [145] test Out[145]    a  b isBool isBool2 0  1  2  False    True 1  4  5   True   False   In [147] b  pd.DataFrame[[45,45]], index[0], columns[a,b]  In [148] b Out[148]     a   b 0  45  45  In [149] test.updateb  In [150] test Out[150]     a   b  isBool  isBool2 0  45  45       0        1 1   4   5       1        0 codepre  pWas this meant to be the behavior of the codeupdatecode function I would think that if nothing was specified that codeupdatecode wouldnt mess with the other columns.p  hr  pstrongEDITstrong I started tinkering around a little more. The plot thickens. If I insert one more command codetest.update[]code before running codetest.updatebcode, boolean behavior works at the cost of numbers upcasted as codeobjectscode. This also applies to DSMs simplified example.p  pBased on a hrefhttpsgithub.compydatapandasblobmasterpandascoreframe.pyL3830 relnofollowpandas source codea, it looks like the reindexlike method is creating a DataFrame of dtype codeobjectcode, while reindexlike codebcode creates a DataFrame of dtype codefloat64code. Since codeobjectcode is more general, subsequent operations work with bools. Unfortunately running codenp.logcode on the numerical columns will fail with an codeAttributeErrorcode. p

Negative 1391 pA typical setup we have a main thread with a codemainMOCcode and a background thread with its own codebackgroundMOCcode. The background thread performs readonly operations on the codebackgroundMOCcode by dispatching blocks to a codebackgroundQueuecode. p  pThe codebackgroundMOCcode needs to merge the changes from the codemainMOCcode so we register for codeNSManagedObjectContextDidSaveNotificationcode and then do something likep  precode voidmainMocDidSaveNSNotification notification      dispatchasyncbackgroundQueue,          [backgroundMoc mergeChangesFromContextDidSaveNotificationnotification]       codepre  pLets say the user deletes an object in the codemainMOCcode. The code above does not seem safe to me, since the merge will be done at some point in the future. Until the merge is done, there might still be blocks on the codebackgroundQueuecode that are trying to use the deleted object.p  pThe obvious solution would be to use codedispatchsynccode instead or codeperformBlockAndWaitcode, codeperformSelectorOnThread...code instead. From the code snippets I see on the interwebs, this seems to be what everybody is doing. But Im not comfortable with this solution either.p  pThe name codeNSManagedObjectContextDidSaveNotificationcode implies that the save has already happened when the notification is delivered. So the corresponding row has already been deleted from the underlying database assuming an sqlite store. codedispatchsynccode will have to wait for other blocks on the queue to finish before it can merge the changes, and these other blocks could still try to work with the deleted object, leading to an codeNSObjectInaccessibleExceptioncode.p  pIt seems to me that the correct way to merge changes from one threadqueue to another would be top  ol liSubscribe to codeNSManagedObjectContextWillSaveNotificationcode and codeNSManagedObjectContextDidSaveNotificationcode on the background thread. li liOn codeNSManagedObjectContextWillSaveNotificationcode empty the codebackgroundQueuecode and suspend any operations that dispatch new blocks to the queue.li liOn codeNSManagedObjectContextDidSaveNotificationcode merge the changes synchronously.li liResume normal operation on the background queue.li ol  pIs this the correct approach or am I missing somethingp

Negative 1391 pThe discussion started under a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions16322465findingtheclosestfloatingpointvaluelessthanaspecificintegervalueinc1632280016322800my answer to another questiona. The following code determines stronga hrefhttpen.wikipedia.orgwikiMachineepsilon relnofollowmachine epsilonastrongp  precodefloat computeeps    float eps  1.0f    while 1.0f  eps  1.0f     eps  2.0f    return eps  codepre  pIn the comments it was proposed that the code1.0f  eps  1.0fcode test might fail because C standard permits the use of extra precision. Although Im aware that floatingpoint operations are actually performed in higher precision than specified by the actual types used, I happen to disagree with this proposal.p  pI doubt that during the comparison operations, such as codecode or codecode, the operands are not truncated to the precision of their type. In other words, code1.0f  epscode can of course be evaluated with the precision higher than codefloatcode for example, codelong doublecode, and the result will be stored in the register that can accommodate codelong doublecode. However, I think that before performing the codecode operation left operand will be truncated from codelong doublecode to codefloatcode, hence the code can never fail to determine codeepscode precisely i.e. it can never do more iterations than intended.p  pI havent found any clue on this particular case in C standard. Furthermore, the code works fine and Im sure that the extra precision technique is used during its execution because I have no doubt that any modern desktop implementation in fact uses extra precision during calculations.p  pWhat do you think about itp

Negative 1391 pDespite finding minimal consistent documentation on this topic, it is my understanding that when you push a git commit from a local repository to a remote repository on a server my remote repository is on a bluehost server that the files are compressed therefore, they will not be immediately visible on the server in their normal form.  p  pOne method that I successfully used to see these files uncompressed is to clone the repository.  I am however trying to use the local repo and remote repo in a workflow system to maintain a wordpress website.  When I push a commit from the local repo to the remote repo, I am not able to access the site through the browser.  Is there an additional step that I need to take that I am missing in order to access the uncompressed version of the files through a browserp  pDo I have to clone the repository to the same folder after each pushp

So I have thisp  precode Select record.id, record.title      select count from complexquerythatreturnsnewerrecords as agePlace,                select count from complexquerythatreturnsrecordswithbetterROI as ROIPlace...  From record... codepre  pNow the issue is that the query is slow  as I had expected give the amount of crunching required. But I realized that there are there are situations where results of 2 subqueries will be the same, and there is no need for me to run the subquery twice.. or have it in my code twice. So I would like to wrap one of the subqueries in an if statement and if the criteria are met, use the value from another column that already calculated that data, else, run the subquery as normal .p  pI have tried just putting the other subquerys alias, but it says unknown column totalSales because the field is in the query, not one of the tables.p  pIs there any way around thisp  pstrongUPDATEstrong I have reposted this as a query refortoring question  thanks for the suggestions.. a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions16878631howtorefactorselectsubqueriesintojoinsHow to refactor select subqueries into joinsap

Negative 1391 pSo Im trying to scan US drivers licenses into a javascript browser app In GWT. The licenses contain LineFeed characters, and the scanner sends this to the host by sending ctrlJ.p  pThis however doesnt work for most browsers because ctrlJ is a browser shortcut and thus my javascript never receives the event.p  pApparently you can use ADF Advanced data formatting to do character replacement, however you cant do that with control characters because in their configuration tool the UI element you use to specify the string to be replaced is a text field, and you cant put control characters into a text field.p  pIve also tried to use the embedded driver license scanning programming, however my scanner always gives the wrong beeps when I attempt to program it and so Im stuck there too.p  pDoes anyone know how I can resolve this Can I tell the browser to turn off shortcuts Can I get the scanner to do control character replacementp  pAny help would be appreciated.p

Negative 1391 pShort of it  Im experimenting with ExecutorService to run multiple threads and the computing time is strongmuchstrong worse with multiple threads than with a single thread, so Im trying to figure out where I went wrong.  If details arent important, skip the long of it below to get to the code.p  pLong of it  I setup a monte carlo method of calculating the area of a circle with radius of 1 to approximate the value of PI.  I modeled it as simulating tossing darts at the circle with randomized x and y coordinates.  Over a large number of tosses, the area of the circle can be approximated by how many darts hit it.p  pI created a DartTosser class implementing runnable to toss an increment of the total number of darts that need to be tossed.  I created an object with an instance field and a synchronized method to aggregate the dart hits from multiple DartTossers.  Once all darts have been tossed, pi is estimated and returned.p  pThe number of threads and number of tosses are read in from user input.  Then a button press triggers the following methodp  precodeprivate double estimatePiint numThreads, long numTosses, TossBin bin     long tossIncrement  numTossesnumThreads     ExecutorService executor  Executors.newFixedThreadPoolnumThreads      for int i  0 i lt numThreads i         executor.submitnew DartTosseri, tossIncrement, bin           executor.shutdown      System.out.printlnAll dart tossers have begun tossing darts.      try          executor.awaitTermination1, TimeUnit.DAYS      catch InterruptedException e          e.printStackTrace           System.out.printlnAll darts have been tossed.      return 4bin.getTotalInCircledoublenumTosses  codepre  pThe DartTosser class triggers the following method in its run method and then adds the total tosses that hit the circle to the instance of the TossBin objectp  precodeprivate long startTossing      for int i  0 i lt localTosses i          get two random doubles between 1 and 1         x  generateRandomNumber         y  generateRandomNumber         distanceSquared  xx  yy         if distanceSquared lt 1.0             tossesInCircle                    return tossesInCircle  codepre  pJust for completeness, this is what my TossBin class looks likep  precodepublic class TossBin      private long totalTossesInCircle  0      public TossBin            public synchronized void addToTotalTosseslong n         this.totalTossesInCircle  n           public void resetTossValues         this.totalTossesInCircle  0           public long getTotalInCircle         return totalTossesInCircle       codepre  pThe PI approximation is close, so I think my actual calculations are good.  Running a single thread, itll process 1 million tosses in around 1600 milliseconds or so.  Running two threads, itll process 1 million tosses in around 5600 milliseconds or so.  The more threads, the more inefficient.

Negative 1391 pIve been used to simply importing jar files into my netbeans projects and then being able to import them in my projects. For example, I included the guava.jar. I saw it under libraries and when I expanded it, I saw things like com.google.common.em. So, I just said import com.google.common.em in my own classes and I was able to use their methods. Similarly for commonsmath33.0.jar. But now I similarly included joptimizer3.2.0sources.jar a hrefhttpwww.joptimizer.comusage.html relnofollowhttpwww.joptimizer.comusage.htmla. When I expand it, I see folders like src.main.com.joptimizer.functions However, this time when I go to my projects and try to say import src.main..., it doesnt work they are not recognized. Why did simply importing the jars work before, but not in this case And what do I need to do in this case to be able to use the methods in the joptimizer jarp

It displays the original image always 940px width, with variable height and overlays the jCrop selector on top, with a fixed width and height 940 x 600. The use can then move the selector up and down not left amp right, because the selector is the same width as the original image and select a portion. The cropping works fine, except for one thing the original, precropped image over which the jCrop selector is shown is missing a few pixels from the left hand side  its more like 935px wide. So that when jCrop crops it, the result is a thin black border down the leftedge.

Negative 1391 pI have 3 activities, each with map fragments. Now I was wondering how I could use hide and show to allow them to stay loaded in the background once the activity is triggered.p  pEssentially the user starts on Homescreen, loads up strongrssstrong feed and strongmapstrong fragment then goes to next activity by clicking button. Then he loads up that activity with map fragment.  If the user then clicks the back button the Homescreen has to be reloaded and the same if he goes back to the second activity.p  pHow can I have it so when an activity is loaded if the the user travels to different activity the old activity stays active but hidden in the background so the data is already downloaded when he travels back.p

Negative 1391 pWe are using SSAS in MS SQL Server 2008 R2 to store a cube with company data. We use this cube as a data source for a pivot grid in a web app and to generate a market penetration report.p  pUsers are able to upload lists of company IDs. The IDs are stored in a database.p  pWhen the user wants to generate a market penetration report, he or she has to specify a list that acts as selection and a list that acts as a market.p  pAfter submitting, the IDs of both lists end up as calculated members in the cube, using MDX statements like thisp  precodeCREATE MEMBER [Prospects].[Measures].[selectids] AS COALESCEEMPTYSUM    [Dim Bedrijf].[BronId].amp[1234], [Dim Bedrijf].[BronId].amp[1235],   ...., [Dim Bedrijf].[BronId].amp[3456], [Measures].[Fact Bedrijven Count] ,0 codepre  pAfter creating these members, more are created for calculating the indicators in the report using members and dimensions already defined in the cube. Finally, there is a select statement that returns the necessary data.p  pThis works fine when the number of IDs in either list is smaller than 100k. If the number gets bigger we start getting timeout errors.

Negative 1391 pI require dygraphs to always lock on to the nearest xaxis point given the mouse position, even when highlightSeries is enabled, but no series is selected. p  pCurrently, when highlightSeries is enabled dygraphs will select the closest point in Euclidean space by Euclidean distance, but this is usually not the correct functionality for my usecase. Instead, I require it to select the closest point where one of the dimensions is fixed i.e. xaxis, so it can only rely on the yaxis when determining which is the closest point. I require this to function with any number of plotted curves.p  pNote that similar functionality is exemplified when the user selects a curve by clicking on it, as demonstrated in the Highlight Closest Series example a hrefhttpdygraphs.comgalleryghighlightedseries relnofollowhttpdygraphs.comgalleryghighlightedseriesa. Similarly, correct functionality is offered when the dygraph plots curves without any highlightSeries enabled.p  pHowever, I require this type of functionality even when there are multiple curves, highlightSeries is enabled, and the user has not selected one in particular. In this case, it should select the nearest curve based on a fixed xaxis, but whichever is nearest on the yaxis.p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comhNS1c.png altClosest point selection in dygraphp  pPlease note that the intersection of the crosshair is also where the mouse was located when the screenshot was taken the mouse itself is not displayed. Dygraph has selected the closest point in Euclidean space, which is highlighted on the curve itself. p  pTo reiterate, instead of this behavior, dygraphs should select the point on the curve at the xaxis point where the mouse is located. In this case, it would be where the gray vertical crosshair component cuts the orange timeseries curve.p  pHow should I achieve this type of behavior p  pstrong EDIT strongp  pOne bad workaround I have created is as followp  precodedyGraphs.mousemovefunction e    var parentOffset  this.parent.offset     var relX  e.pageX  parentOffset.left    g.setSelectiong.findClosestRowrelX   codepre  pUnfortunately, due to the nature of mousemove this interferes with the clickanddrag for zooming highlight interaction native to dygraphs, and also requires more logic to stop the circles on the curve from rounding up too soon and jumping to the next datapoint. Surely there has to be a better solutionp  pstrong EDIT 2 strongp  pBelow is a workaround that selects lockson to the nearest curveseries given a fixed row xaxis point, by working out which series is closest to the current Y position minus a 10px offset, unique to my situation. Also, it will not interfere with the clickanddrag for zooming highlight interaction native to dygraphs and it provides basic logic to stop the circles on the curve from rounding up too soon and jumping to the next datapoint n.b. using fixed value or 90px offset unique to my use case.p  precodedyGraphs.mousemovefunction e var parentOffset  this.parent.offset var relX  e.pageX  parentOffset.left var relY  e.pageY  parentOffset.top var relX2  relX   dyGraphs.width  90   g.numRows  2 var yOffsets  [] var closestDistance  999  Arbitrary large number var closestIdx  1  for var i  0 i lt g.numColumns  2 i      yOffsets.push g.toDomYCoordg.getValueg.findClosestRowrelX2, i1    .eachyOffsets, function i,e      var difference  Math.abse  parseFloatrelY10     if difference  lt closestDistance          closestDistance  difference         closestIdx  i        if e.which  1 ampamp closestIdx  1       g.setSelectiong.findClosestRowrelX2, g.getLabels[closestIdx1]  codepre  pIs there a better solutionp

Negative 1391 pI have a program called BlueCoat Proxy installed on my school issued laptop that basically blocks every second website on the Internet, including stack exchange, YouTube and yahoo answers. I do not have administrator rights, nor can I delete anything in program files, I tried every possible method of obtaining admin rights.p  pIt is not accessible in task manager it doesnt even appear there. I tried to close it with Windows command prompt through commands like taskkill but every it returns Access is Denied Im only denied access with that program.p  pDoes anyone know a method of crashing a program with a batch file or VB program I was thinking something like the ping command, though for a program. Maybe automating 100 meaningless requests to the programp  pYour input is appreciated, thank you.p
Negative 1391 pThe below code I have on an Excel sheet. I am using VBA to alter the contents of certain cells in order to format them correctly for my job. We keep a list of damages, bay locations, and VINs. Each one of these columns has their own certain formats, and for 2 of them I have working fine. Some of you may recognize some of this code from another post I had about getting the damage codes formatted correctly. The columns are ordered as suchp  precodeBay Location  VIN  Damage Codes codepre  pFor VIN, all we do is uppercase the letters. Simple, got that done. The damage codes function works perfectly after Ive altered it a bit to better suit my needs. Could not have done that without the original help I received here. Heres where things get weird, my boss, seeing that I had gotten this to work for the damage codes, asked me to get it to AutoFormat the bays. The bay locations at my job have a few possibilities, but there is always at least 1 letter in front such asp  ol liH5li liH125li liHH50li li7A70li liFNCE13li ol  pIn English, what I want done is this  Input unformatted bay, such as 7a12, uppercase the letters, split it by the numbers, and add a dash in between the two groups, and voila. p  pI had this working, even showed it to my boss. But then I added in the code to uppercase the VIN column and I started getting an error, highlighting the line p  precodeSet allMatches  RE1.ExecutestrSource codepre  pThe RE1.teststrSource runs fine, but trying to grab the matchessubmatches now mysteriously throws an error. I originally used the text from a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions8146485returningaregexmatchinvbaexcelThis StackOverflow questiona to get it working. The error I get is something akin to it telling me that the object isnt set.

Negative 1391 pIn hist recent a hrefhttpwww.infoq.compresentationsdatatypesissuestalka at Strange Loop Martin Odersky shed the light on his vision of Scalas future version called Dotty.

Negative 1391 pIm working on a project in C which deals with comma separated data CSV.  What I do is reading the data from a .csv file into a vector of CsvRow objects.br So, today I encountered a really weird stdbadalloc exceptions being thrown in much more weird situations. Namely, the first test case in which I managed to get a little more time until I get the exception thrown was reading a whole csv file into a vector. The file consists of 500,000 rows and its size is about 70MB.  The file was read into memory like a charm, but then after a few seconds into the sorting procedure, the stdbadalloc gets thrown. It used roughly 67MB of RAM Note Im using boosts flyweights in order to reduce memory consumption.p  pBUT, this test case was even stranger Im reading a 146KB file with a few hundreds of lines, and this time I got the exception while reading the data into a vector, which is totally ridiculous having a 70MB successfully read previously.p  pIm suspecting a memoryleak, but my machine has 8GB of RAM, using 64bit Windows 8. Im using CodeBlocks, and a MinGW 64bit boost distro. Any help would be appreciated.

Negative 1391 pI have a legacy application that has a unit test module thats separate from the application modules. Im converting the project to use Gradle and the structure looks like thisp  precoderoot   module1   module2   ...   moduleN   test codepre  pwhere the test module executes tests for module1 through moduleN and depends on them. I know this isnt a very good practice as it kinda defeats the purpose of unit tests but as all know, legacy code is always a headache to work with. p  pSo before I start refactoring the code so that each module has its own unit tests which means disassembling the test module in a sensible way, i.e., a lot of work I wanted to find a temporary solution to get the correct code coverage, i.e., have JaCoCo instrument all the classes from module1, ..., moduleN instead of just module test.p  pIs there a way to tell JaCoCo to instrument classes from other modulesp

Negative 1391 pIm using Jersey 2 and Spring, and Im trying to initialize my Jersey application i.e. the class derived from ResourceConfig with parameters from the Spring context.p  pBackground I have a single Jersey application that I build i.e. a single WAR and I deploy it across a server cluster with different Spring configurations on different servers to enable or disable different parts of the server, e.g. some of the servers have codesearchcode resources turned on, etc. This was really easy in Jersey 1.0 I just put,p  precodeltcontextcomponentscan basepackagecom.mycompany.resources.searchgt codepre  pin a Spring config to have Jersey scan that particular package and enable the JAXRS resource providers in it.p  pNow in Jersey 2.0 the Spring codeltcontextcomponentscan ... gtcode doesnt work, so resources have to be programmatically registered in a startup class derived from codeResourceConfigcodep  precodepublic class MyApplication extends ResourceConfig       public MyApplication          packagescom.mycompany.resources.search       codepre  pSo far so good, but I need to strongconditionallystrong scan that package, and I cant figure out how to get any Spring configuration into the codeMyApplicationcode class.

JohnRs answer was to have the object initialized twice first by Spring and then by JerseyHK2. When Spring initializes the object you cache the dependencies in a static member, and then when JerseyHK2 initializes it later you can retrieve the dependencies.p  pI ended up doing thisp  precodepublic class MyApplication extends ResourceConfig       public MyApplication          ApplicationContext rootCtx  ContextLoader.getCurrentWebApplicationContext         MyConfiguration myConfiguration  rootCtx.getBeanMyConfiguration.class          if myConfiguration.isEnabled              packagescom.mycompany.resources.whatever                codepre  pRather than having the object initialized twice, we let JerseyHK2 initialize it but then we retrieve the dependencies from Spring.p  pBoth solutions are vulnerable to timing they both assume that Spring is initialized before JerseyHK2.p

Its not working.p  pI made a page with five  boxes that you can click. When you click one, it will run a function stored in one js file and look through cases to find the one that matches, then change the text in the text box as well as the choices in the five  boxes below.

Negative 1391 pMy issue may be the structure of the tables that Im working with and Im open for any suggestions.  I have the following four tables that are set up to allow a company to have a set of Questions and each Question has multiple answers.

So depending on how an individual answers a question, heshe can be directed to a different question based on each answer.  p  pMy current issue is that I need to be able to get the first question in the hierarchy.  I attempted to achieve this with a recursive CTE, but dont believe Ive set it up properly or even possible due to the table structure as I receive a maximum recursion error and suppressing the maximum with optionmaxrecursion 0 doesnt help as it doesnt seem to complete.  Im assuming that this is because the portion of the CTE where it joins back on itself is returning multiple rows.

Negative 1391 pSo I have a monthly report that exists in excel with a connection to an SSAS cube.p  pRecently we have had to make a change to the Cube, specifically with regard to a date dimension and rolling over to 2014. p  pHere is the issue  If I connect to the cube from a fresh excel file, the data gets pulled in just fine, however if i simply refresh the existing excel file that already has the pivot tables connected to the cube and the connection already established, I can view updated data for the months that existed previously, but I am missing the most recent month of data.p  pBoth of the connections in the excel files are pointing to the same saved connection string in my my documents  my data sources folder.p  pInterestingly, if i copy the pivot table from the file that isnt displaying the data correctly, and paste it into a new file, the connection gets re established and the data gets pulled in. Furthermore, if I create a new pivot table from that same connection in the SAME FILE it pulls in the correct data. p  pI am at a loss, is there something about the way the pivot table interacts with the connection that I am missingp  pHere is an image, I have redacted any company  personal information but it shouldnt affect anything.p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comPIoPJ.png althttpimgur.comFYboIPip

Negative 1391 pFirst of all, apologies if that has been asked before its a rather hard thing to search for. p  pIm wondering how I can add all files that match a certain pattern to to the index while still excluding any patterns in the code.gitignorecode. p  pFor example, I have a repo that holds some tex code. I keep the code.texcode file and also the compiled code.pdfcode under version control, while ignoring the auxiliary files p  precode cat .gitignore  LaTeX auxiliary files .aux .log .out codepre  pI often commit both the code.texcode file and code.pdfcode file at the same time, and so given that I have the following files in the repo p  precodemytexdoc.aux mytexdoc.log mytexdoc.out mytexdoc.pdf mytexdoc.tex codepre  pWhat I would emlikeem to do is to be able to run codegit add mytexdoc.code to add the files that match this pattern, but are not ignored under code.gitignorecode, i.e. codemytexdoc.texcode and codemytexdoc.pdfcode. However when I do run this command, I get a message like this p  precode git add mytexdoc. The following paths are ignored by one of your .gitignore files mytexdoc.aux mytexdoc.log mytexdoc.out Use f if you really want to add them. fatal no files added codepre  pIs it even possible to do this If not, does anyone know the rationale behind it Because it seems counterintuitive to me. p

Negative 1391 pWe have a web application through which customers access information. It has been reported by many customers that they are logged out within 5 minutes of no activity. I believe this should only occur after the default 20 minute idle timeout, and this is the case when accessing the web app from inside our domain.p  pI also spent a few days troubleshooting an error in which some of the users session data was lost between post backs about 60 of the time, causing an application error since the next page needed the data. The only resolution was a workaround in which I use an additional mechanism for caching the data between postbacks and pull the data from that cache if the session data is gone.p  pI have also noted that some websites that emIem visit which require logon credentials will also kick emmeem out between postbacks. For example, a website for a school I take classes at requires logon credentials to their portal. At home I never have any issue, but if I access it from my work domain I often get random errors indicating that my credentials have been lost i.e. Unauthorized access is not permitted after logging in and browsing to a page.p  pCombing the web for ideas has led me down a few paths, but most address the IIS worker process and ASP.NET and have not helped me.p  pDoes anyone have any ideas or suggestions about how to resolve thisp

Negative 1391 pMy work inbox has a very small size limit, so managing attachments is a major pain. I think a simple macro would help address this, but I dont know much VB.p  pstrongWhat I want to dostrong Every time a user attaches a file to an email, the path to the location that the user pulls the file from will be automatically added to the bottom of the body of the email and linked. That way, attachments can be deleted from the email saving space, but the link to the file will remain intact, so when youre looking through emails you can still find the related attachment.p  pIf more than one file is added, more than one link will be added. If files are added then deleted, the links will follow suit. p  pThis macro would be distributed to everyone we work with and it would constantly be running so every email would have links to every attachment.p  pDoes anyone know how to do thisp  pThanks a lotp

Negative 1391 pIve implemented a C solution for testing various strategies in reaction to the series of random events. Im aggregating results from multithreaded simulations running on a couple of computers. p  pA single simulation yields one integer outcome and typically requires generating around 100 uniform random integers and is repeated 1,000,000 times before a chunk of aggregated data mean, standard deviation, minimum, maximum is saved. Although, the results of such chunks are consistent up to 6 significant digits on a given architecture, the discrepancies between two computers running exactly the same program are orders of magnitude larger.p  pSo far, I ran the program the same executable on two personal Windows notebooks with Intel processors and one AWS c3.8xlarge Windows Server instance. On each computer the ongoing simulation quickly approaches a different value. The relative discrepancies between means are of the order of 103. On a single computer, the relative difference of means between 1million chunks rarely exceeds 106.p  pThe program uses the codemt19937code random number generator from codeltrandomgtcode. I use codetimeNULLcode for seeding.p  pI cant come up with a reason for such an inconsistency. The Mersenne Twister is considered a sound generator for Monte Carlo simulations and I used it many times, often being able to analytically verify the results. I can understand slight differences and diversions from uniformity due to generator imperfections and underlying architecture but with such order of magnitude, its hard to comprehend.p

Negative 1391 pI am writing a function that accepts a numeric string as argument, then does some calculations with it and returns it.p  pAs you probably noted, I am doing calculations with a string. Although it works without problems in PHP, I know that other language would throw an error. That leads to my questionp  pShould I cast the string to an integer before my calculations, then calculate with the int and cast the result back again to a string Would that be a cleaner style somehow Or is it really ok to be type unspecific in PHPp

Negative 1391 pI am currently having some problems with a GUI calculator that I am working on. The calculator compiles and does do calculations. To do a calculation you must first input a number, select a functions , , , or , select another number, then press equals. After a equation has been performed the program must be cleared before continuing. I am having trouble figuring out how to make it so that the program does not need to press clear before continuing with the calculations. I want to be able to click a number, click , click a number, click equals to get the answer then press  again to add another number to the equation. Any help with this would be greatly appreciated.p  precodeimport java.awt.BorderLayout import java.awt.Color import java.awt.Dimension import java.awt.Font import java.awt.GridBagConstraints import

So the problem seems to be due to conversion within excel after download, most probably due to a unsopported charset.p  pI tried to convert the result string in JSP to different charsets, but the problem still persists.p  pDoes anyone know a solutionp  pThank You very much in advancep

I need to perform a 2D Kohonen map fitting to the underlying distribution.p  pThe simplest way of doing it in Python I found so far would be to use the codenewccode module from a hrefhttpspythonhosted.orgneurolabexnewc.html relnofollowneurolaba.p  pHowever, this module requires a cloud or points and I would need to sample the Ndimensional array to recover the points that would correspond to my original density distribution.p  pWhat would be the most efficient way to perform such sampling Alternatively, are there any Kohonen map modules that would work directly with the density arraysp

Negative 1391 pFor our ASP.NET Web Application using MVC 5, we are using the builtin ASP.NET Identities system.  By default this generates a bunch of useful tables for us, including AspNetUsers.  Our Entity Framework model which weve created includes entities which need to use the AspNetUsers.Id column as a foreign key constraint.p  pIt doesnt appear to be possible to create a foreign key to a table not included in our Entity Framework Data Model, but never the less I need to do emsomethingem to make this foreign key constraint possible, without screwing up the default Identities API.p  pOne idea I had was to create like a UserProxies entity in our data model.  Then whenever a new User is created and added to AspNetUsers, heshe is also added to our UserProxies table.  That way we have a copy of the AspNetUsers data in our data model, and can confidently make reference to the UserProxies.Id column and know that it matches up to an AspNetUsers.Id.p  pThis kind of sucks though because its just duplicating data.p  pThe other idea I had was, just ignore the foreign key constraint and always trust that the relationship is valid.  This also sucks but may be acceptable for what were doing if there is no solution that doesnt involve reinventing the wheel.p

Negative 1391 pI have a complex web app, which is working fine in desktop browsers, as well as in the Android native browser which is part of why I got so long into this project before noticing this problem. The server setup is using the Typesafe Stack PlayAkkaScala, but I suspect thats not relevant to the question. Suffice it to say, it uses bogstandard transient session cookies to keep your login.p  pThe problem is, in Chrome and Safari, that transient session appears to be emtooem fragile, and very unpredictably so. In both cases, so long as I am working actively in the browser, everything is fine. But if I switch away from the browser for a while and return to it, it often loses the session cookie, forcing a relogin. Sometimes it takes an hour or two, sometimes just a few minutes  I havent yet been able to figure out a pattern.p  pNote that this doesnt involve closing the tab with my app in it, or manually closing the browser process. I would emexpectem to be able to switch away from Chrome and come back to it using the app switcher and still have my session there for some reason, though, it seems to be frequently and quickly losing the session cookie. This is a killer problem users shouldnt be forced to relogin too often.p  pAny ideas or pointers to why these browsers might be losing their session cookies so easily Ive done lots of web development, but this is my first time seriously targeting mobile browsers, and Im clearly missing something...p

The one thing that is causing problems is the jquerys codedocument.readycode function.p  pSince in an angular project the page is just loaded once, most of the codedocument.readycode parts in any of the pages are not working. Every time a page changes, there is some code to inside this function that doesnt work.p  pSo whichever controller in my project is supposed to have any code that works on codedocument.readycode I am throwing it in the controller like this p  precodesetTimeoutfunction scope.applyfunction     var whtwindow.height    var wwtwindow.width    whtwindow.height    wwtwindow.width    ifwht gt 450        var mcht  wht  header.height footer.height50        .loginpage.cssheight,mchtpx        .loginpage.csspaddingtop,mcht  1582 px                codepre  pThis works very well.p  pBut I think this counters angularJS philosophy of separation of concerns . The controller is where you have only your business logic. p  pWhere is the best place to throw this piece of code p
Negative 1391 pIs it possible to pass a function written from scratch to another function or class instantiationp  pThis is what I have right nowp  precodeclass FooObject     def initself, name, somefunction         self.name  name         self.somefunction  somefunction  def afunctionparam1, param2     return param1  param2  Bar  FooSomething, afunction  Bar.somefunction2, 3 returns 5 codepre  pIm wondering whether its possible to not have to declare codeafunctioncode beforehand, but just write the code directly as a parameter to codesomefunctioncode during instantiation. Something like thisp  precodeclass FooObject     def initself, name, somefunction         self.name  name         self.somefunction  somefunction  Bar  FooSomething, def afunctionparam1, param2 return param1  param2  OR  Bar  FooSomething, Anonymousfunctiontechnique return param1  param2  Bar.somefunction2, 3 returns 5 codepre  pAnd also, this is not a job for lambda The functions may be pretty complex, which function calls inside of them and with multiple parameters. Also, I shouldnt be able to access it anywhere else so a declaration outside wont work it seems.p  pIs something like this possible If so, how And if not, what would be the best way to do what Im trying to dop  pThanksp

Ive use p because I wanted to print the correct address the pointer was pointing at, I was assuming that after I use p I need to use p so the pointer will point at the address of the value of 30, but if I added the p and printed it Ive noticed that it prints another value. So something here doesnt click for me whats going on with it  Also if I removed the  and then printed, it printed 30 and then 40 as I expected BUT the address remained the same, Ive expected it to be the previous address4 which it wasnt yet the value changed, whats going on p  pa hrefhttpimgur.comGRRInBL relnofollowhttpimgur.comGRRInBLap

As you may have noticed this array represents a matrix. before allocating it in this way I tried to allocate it with a pointer to pointers. this required more space in memory 8billions of bytes more in order to save the address of each pointer. In this way I got my program killed, while now I dont, but when I try to access some addresses I get segmentation fault.p  pstrongeditstrong if i allocate 10 blocks of 160 millions or even more i dont get any error and the memory is allocated. the problem is in allocating one big block. my question now becomes is there a way to overcome this limitp  pstrongedit2strong Sanhadrin your hypothesis are all correct, except for the fact that I use gcc.

Negative 1391 pI have a LINQ query that filters and orders a list of records from a database by dynamic properties and skipstakes according to current paginationsettings the appropriate amount of records.p  pThis all works fine. Now I want to group the records by dynamic keys again and be able to expand the groups each individually on users choice. Additionally I need this to work with the pagination.p  pSo for example I have a list of say 100 records codenew  Name  ..., Category  ..., Prop1  ..., Prop2  ..., code which are already filtered and ordered from the total set of whatever records. Lets assume we got 10 different categories ranging from 1 to 10 and the current pagination is set to 10 items starting at 0.p  pNow I want these records grouped by their codeCategorycode and lets say the groups where codeCategory  5code items matching this 3 and codeCategory  8code items matching this 10 expanded, the rest collapsed.p  pWhat should be returned p  precodeGroup Category  1 Group Category  2 Group Category  3 Group Category  4 Group Category  5               Name, Category, Prop1, Prop2, ...           Name, Category, Prop1, Prop2, ...           Name, Category, Prop1, Prop2, ...       Group Category  6 Group Category  7 Group Category  8               Name, Category, Prop1, Prop2, ...       codepre  pSo the returned amount of entries is 10. Collapsed categories count for 1 entry each and expanded categories count for the items they hold. The last expanded category got cut down because the items would exceed the total requested amount of entries 10.p  pIdeally this is all based on codeIQueryablecode so that only the requested items get pulled from the database.p  pI did look into codeGroupBycode and codeGroupJoincode, but I am not sure on how to limit the items in those groupings by the requested recordcount.p

Negative 1391 pI can successfully debug the front end of a web application running on a mobile device using Googles Chrome DevTools chromeinspect strongwhenstrong my mobile device is using the Chromes browser using port forwarding.

Negative 1391 pI have a situation where Id like to use a UISearchController to allow searchingfiltering the contents of a UITableView. The behavior I want is IDENTICAL to what Apple does in the Contacts app where the search bar stays pinned to the top of the table view, content scrolling underneath. When the search bar is tapped, I want the default behavior of the bar animating to cover the navigation bar with results below, again just like Apple contacts. p  pIve made a sample app to isolate things and have paired it down to the following search controller init code. This VC is the root view controller of a UINavigationController with a translucent nav bar. p  precodeself.navigationItem.title  Title self.edgesForExtendedLayout  UIRectEdgeNone  self.searchController  [[UISearchController alloc] initWithSearchResultsControllernil] self.searchController.searchBar.frame  CGRectMake0.0f, 0.0f, 320.0f, 44.0f self.searchController.hidesNavigationBarDuringPresentation  YES self.searchController.dimsBackgroundDuringPresentation  NO [self.view addSubviewself.searchController.searchBar] self.definesPresentationContext  YES codepre  pThis results in two issues 1 The search bar does not expand height to 64px so you still see whats behind the status bar and 2 whenever you push an item onto the navigation stack and then go back, the content in the parent view table view jumps.p  pIve seen a ton of confusion around UISearchcontroller, so Im not terribly optimistic that someone has a good solution, but trying anyway. p

Negative 1391 pstrongVersionsstrongp  pPython 3.4 with Pygame 1.9.2p  pstrongQuestionstrongp  pHow can I pass the name of a functionmethod from one module, where this function does NOT exist, to the module containing it without having to resort to making it a string and evaluating it by evalp  pstrongBackgroundstrongp  pI have a simple MVC pattern for training purposes. For simplicitys sake lets just presume we pressed a button in the menu. Heres what happensp  pThe controller sends our event, the click as ClickEvent containing position, mouse button and if the button was pressed or released, to the currently running logic, the menu. The menu then evaluates the click depending on its position and if it happened on a button, it returns a ModelEvent containing the name of a method of the model. The model then receives said ModelEvent and evaluates it. If any visible changes happen, it creates a new ViewEvent this would go beyond my question.p  pstrongApproachesstrongp  pI approached the problem in three ways so far, once by lambda which doesnt seem to fit my needs at all or I horribly misunderstood it and twice by using strings with eval. The shortcomings of the latter approach are obvious The name of the function has to be passed between the instances as a string and then evaluated by eval which takes its time.p  pWhat would be an efficient way to pass the names of methods and functions from one module, where they dont exist, to another, where they are to be executed, without having to use strings and evalp  pOr, if you see any grave mistakes in my general approach, Id be glad to hear about it as Im still learning.p
Negative 1391 pSo Im webmastering this page full of ebulletins and ppl are asking options to sort different bulletins by their importance.

The button and similarly constructed buttons work fine in the way that they are showing or hiding the div elements and the bulletins inside them when the user is clicking different buttons. But the code wont store anything to localStorage according to Chrome. Im obviously doing something wrong here. What that might bep

Negative 1391 pIm fairly new to adding additional libraries to Visual Studio 2013 as well as the idea that floats and doubles are usually not accurate enough when dealing with certain things like money.  I originally thought that BOOSTMultiprecision cppdecfloat would solve this problem but as I tested it I noticed some unusually things and realized that I could be wrong.  for example,p  precodecppdecfloat50 decimal  0.45 double dbl  0.45 for comparison  cout ltlt fixed ltlt setprecision50 ltlt boost     ltlt decimal ltlt endl cout ltlt double   ltlt dbl ltlt endl codepre  pwould give results like thisp  precodeboost    0.45000000000000001110223024625156540423631668090820 double   0.45000000000000001000000000000000000000000000000000 codepre  pinstead of what I expected 0.45000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000.p  pis this not going to be much more accurate than just using floats or doubles  If not, Im assuming the boost library I just linked to my VS2013 has an arbitrary integer type, would this be acceptable the only thing I dont like about using integers for such a thing is that Id probably have to convert interest rates into integers before multiplying it with currency which would likely result in a very, very large number which may or may not cause performance issues.p  passuming BOOST isnt what I need what are your thoughts on Intels Decimal FloatingPoint Library I couldnt get it to work yet so Im wondering if it is worth the effort. Are there any other similar libraries worth checking outp

This way one could emsimulateem some additional content to get required results.p  pIf there were flex groups it would be much easier because one could change codeflexdirectioncode to codecolumncode and group several items together1amp2amp3, 4amp5 and 6amp7 and position them in coderowcode within flex group with proper widths.p

Negative 1391 pI am trying to write a TCP proxy using pythons twisted framework. I started with the twisteds port forward example and it seems to do the job in a standard secnario. The problem is that I have a rather peculiar scenario. What we need to so is to process each tcp data packet and look for a certain pattern. In case the pattern matches we need to do a certain process. This process takes anywhere between 3040 seconds I know its not a good design but currently thats how things stand. The trouble is that if this process starts all other packets get heldstuck up till the process completes. So if there are 100 live connections and even if 1 of them calls the process all the remaining 99 processes are stuck. Is there a standard twisted way wherein each connectionsession is handled in a separate thread so that the blocking process does not intervene with the other live connectionsp  pExample Code p  precodefrom twisted.internet import reactor from twisted.protocols import portforward from twisted.internet import threads   def processingOperationdata  doing the processing operation here         sleep30         return data  def serverdataReceivedself, data          if data.findpattern we need to testltgt 1                 data  processingOperationdata          portforward.Proxy.dataReceivedself, data portforward.ProxyServer.dataReceived  serverdataReceived  def clientdataReceivedself, data          portforward.Proxy.dataReceivedself, data portforward.ProxyClient.dataReceived  clientdataReceived reactor.listenTCP8383, portforward.ProxyFactoryxxx.yyy.uuu.iii, 80  reactor.run codepre  pMany Thanks Abhip

Negative 1391 pIve researched this question on here multiple times, but I havent exactly found a workaround that either works in my case, or one that I understand, so please bear with me. p  pBasically I have a hierarchical organization of functions, and that is preventing me from multiprocessing in the toplevel.

Negative 1391 pI have read the following sentence in a documents talk about the drawback of short time Fourier transform, and  he is said p  blockquote   pthe drawback is that once you choose a particular size for the time   window, that window is the same for all frequenciesp blockquote  pSo what is the relation between frequencies and the size of window. If we have a high frequency component in a part of a signal how will not be able to detect this frequency if the size of the window is not smallerbigger enoughp  pFurthermore, he is said about wavelet transform  p  blockquote   pWavelet analysis allows the use of long time intervals where we want   more precise lowfrequency information, and shorter regions where we   want highfrequency informationp blockquote  pI feel that the answer has a relation with nyquest rate somehowp
Negative 1391 pFirstly I am self teaching myself MVC so none of this may be best practice and the question may be considered MVC 101.  I have googled and tried various things for days so in frustration I am looking for help. p  pI am using MVC5, EF6, and Bootstrap 3p  pMy objective is simple  I want to display a view that lets the user input a time using a clockstyle timepicker for Bootstrap a hrefhttpsgithub.comweareoutmanclockpicker relnofollowThe actual Clockpicker found here on GitHuba.  The result of which is then populated back to my database when the user clicks create on the view.p  pI cant seem to get it working however.  Below I have included a simplified version of the Model, Controller and View.  In the view I can get the clockpicker to display using HTML that I found in examples but I am not sure how to bind to my model.  If I use html helper methods using the way I have been doing for other bootstrap elements, it wont display the clock picker.  If I code it up as per the example, it will display the clockpicker but I then dont know how to bind the result back to my model and therefore database.p  pIf you have any example code or can point me to somewhere that may explain how I should do this I would appreciate it.p  pI hope the question makes sense. p  pstrongMODELstrong p  precodeusing System using System.ComponentModel.DataAnnotations using System.ComponentModel.DataAnnotations.Schema  namespace ATAS.Models    public partial class Authorisation  IControllerHooks       public long AuthorisationId  get set       [Required, StringLength10]     public string AuthorisationNumber  get set       [Required]     [DataTypeDataType.Date]     public DateTime StartTime  get set       [Required]     [DataTypeDataType.Date]     public DateTime FinishTime  get set      codepre  pstrongCONTROLLERstrong I have just included Create Actionp  precodeusing System.Data.Entity using System.Linq using System.Net using System.Web.Mvc using ATAS.Data using ATAS.Models  namespace ATAS.Controllers      public class AuthorisationsController  Controller          private DataManager db  new DataManager            GET AuthorisationsCreate     public ActionResult Create              ViewBag.AuthorisedEmployeeId  new SelectListdb.Employees, EmployeeId, FullName         ViewBag.PaymentTypeId  new SelectListdb.OvertimeTypes, PaymentTypeId, Description         ViewBag.AuthorisingEmployeeId  new SelectListdb.Employees, EmployeeId, FullName         return View            POST AuthorisationsCreate      To protect from overposting attacks, please enable the specific properties you want to bind to, for       more details see httpgo.microsoft.comfwlinkLinkId317598.

I created an educational website, used by students and instructors, and they send messages sometimes between each others. I also send mail to confirm registers, recovery password, as a lot of others websites do. I only send messages to people who was agreed with my terms of service, that includes the information about my mail policy. It is a small service, I never sent more than 2,000 messages in a month I have 800 registered users so farp  p2 I do not believe I was blacklisted, mxtools verify several blacklists databases and my IP have passed in all verifications. Also, the server is not rejecting all messages from my IP, I can send messages with my personal email with the same domain, but I use different services to handle my personal inbox with my domain and the emails send by my website. So, I guess it may be a DNS record mistake.p  p3 I only use mailgun or others transactional email services like mandrill or sendgrid because it is highly recommended and easy. I use a small VPS and it is hard to configure my own email service I am a programmer, I am not an expert in that kind of configuration. If exists negative factors about the use of these systems, I really like to know and learn more.p

Negative 1391 pI have a java application and some native c code. The java application runs some threads. Each thread has an array of double which is passed as parameter to the native code. So far everything works well. Now in my native code, I want to write values in the array. Currently Im doing this byp  precode  JNIEXPORT void JNICALL JavaJNIPerformanceTestalterArray3I3D     JNIEnv env, jobject, jintArray intArray, jdoubleArray doubleArray           jint count  envgtGetArrayLengthdoubleArray          jdouble Snative  envgtGetDoubleArrayElementsdoubleArray, NULL           for int i0 i lt count i                  Snative[i]  i                     jint count2  envgtGetArrayLengthintArray          jint Snative2  envgtGetIntArrayElementsintArray, NULL            for int i0 i lt count2 i                  Snative2[i]  i                     envgtReleaseDoubleArrayElementsdoubleArray, Snative, 0          envgtReleaseIntArrayElementsintArray, Snative2, 0      codepre  pAs the GetArrayLength and GetDoubleArrayElements take some time and Im always passing the same java array instance to the native code, Im wondering if there is a solution without getting the elementpointer and releasing functioncalls.

Negative 1391 pI have an ASP.Net MVC Web App that has been configured to use Azure AD for authentication. I have configured Azure AD with 2 Reply URLs  one localhost for development and one for production hosting. The site works fine running on my machine on localhost, using IIS Express through Visual Studio. It also runs fine on my machine and other devs machines also when using full blown IIS and the full domain name mapped locally to my machine through the hosts file. However, if I try to deploy the exact same codebase to a host server Win 2012 R2  IIS 8.5  .Net 4.5 the authentication doesnt work. This is using the exact same URL as works on IIS on my machine.p  pDoes anyone have any ideas what might be preventing my app from running on the server I have no error messages to go on. After the Azure AD login page I get redirected back to my app where it cycles for a minute or so and just remains a white screen. I have now tried it on 2 separate host servers and got the same result. p  pHopefully someone can help, I really need to get this working. Should this just workp  pThanks.p

Negative 1391 pFirst of all, Im a beginner in mongoDB so please be patient with me. Im using windows and I created a simple database that contains 4 collections. When Im dealing with mongoDB, I first run codemongod.exe dbpath Path To Data Foldercode in a terminal and then I connect to the mongod using codemongo.execode. What Im supposed to do is to distribute the database along with its collections into shards and replica sets for supporting distributed queries. p  pI tried to use commands like codesh.enableShardingDATABASE NAMEcode but it didnt work. I then figured out that I need to run mongos instead of mongod, so I followed this a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions15813194shardinginmongodbSharding in MongoDBa but unfortunately I didnt succeeded. I also did some research but it seems there is a lack of tothepoint guides on sharding and replication. So if you point me to the right direction, I would really appreciate it. p

I understand why this is happening because setfigure is being called every time drawclock is called. Im new to MATLAB, so if theres a way to stop creating new figure with the code skeleton above.

Negative 1391 pAs far as I understand, Vagrant is used to serve web applications under different server configurations in order to mimic production environments during local development, but is it recommended to use Vagrant to be able to set up local development environments that do not actually run web applications themselves, but are used to write code, install npm packages, compile CSS, etcp  pI know that some  if not many  people write code on the host machine, but as I am a heavy terminal user, I would prefer to move my local development environment to a VM which could then be reinstalled in a different machine in a matter of minutes. Whether this is one of the intended use cases for Vagrant seems really confusing to me.p  pP.S. This Vagrant VM would not run any web applications, i.e. it would not act as a web server, but rather as an isolated environment for development tools like vim, gulp, bower and others. I would prefer to spin up separate Vagrant VMs to serve my web applications.p

Negative 1391 pI am writing Java code toward multiple Hadoop clusters, one of which is HDP 2.2 and another CDH4. I write code that needs to be runnable on both. This results in requiring different versions of multiple Hadoop dependencies, which are not backward compatible. For example, the HDP version requires use of Protobuf for Hbase for custom Filters, because its newer than 0.96, whereas CDH4 uses Hbase 0.94. I have reduced all Hadoop dependencies for my code down to a few packages in one API, and have used Maven Profiles for code that depends on that, but Id like to utilize the DRY principle if possible so that code that I write to develop toward that API doesnt have to be cherrypicked or copied from HDP to CDH4 each time I make a change.p  pI currently have this code in multiple git branches, but that has been hard to maintain.p  pI realize that Java is intended for write once, run anywhere, but this is one of those cases where it doesnt seem to work out easily.  I can think of a few potential options, some of which would potentially refactor only the code that cant be repeated into a separate locationp  ul liUse Maven submodules and select a submodule based on the Hadoop version Im building towards with Maven Profiles.  li liRefactor the code from multiple git branches into separate Java packages in the same project, and use Maven Profiles and the Maven compiler exclude option to select the package based on the Hadoop version.li liThere are probably better solutions that Im not aware of.li ul

Negative 1391 pIn my wpf app, I have a codeModelBasecode class that all my models inherit from, that inherits codeIDataErrorInfocode.

Negative 1391 pIm building an Atlassian Confluence plugin and Ive been running into a problem that I cant seem to resolve. In short, Im attempting to write a simple integration test for my plugin that utilizes the Autowiring that the Atlassian SDK provides as noted in their tutorial a hrefhttpsdeveloper.atlassian.comdocsgettingstartedwritingandrunningplugintestsrunwiredtestswiththeplugintestconsole relnofollowherea.p  pIve attempted to replicate the tutorial, with success. Im able to make a barebones confluence plugin with a basic unit and integration test and run them successfully with codeatlasintegrationtestcode and check the entire build with codeatlasdebugcode.p  pHowever, in my more complicated plugin with a few components etc. Im finding that when I run codeatlasintegrationtestcode, I am receiving a warningp  precodejava.lang.Exception No tests found in class [it.pathto.testclass] codepre  pNote that I build my more complicated plugin off of the barebones confluence plugin template. The main differences are that Im using an older version of confluence 5.3.4 vs the newer version 5.7.5 in the simple plugin. Otherwise, all other dependencies are the same. Additionally, Ive retained the old integration test that worked in the barebones template, so this problem isnt because of a new integration test that Ive written up incorrectly.p  pHere is a a hrefhttppastebin.combrbfXnx8 relnofollowpastebina of the pom file I have for my plugin.

Negative 1391 pIm trying to run a user defined aggregate query to periodically roll up some values in a large table.  Im only trying to aggregate one partition at a time, but each partition can have lots of rows.p  pOnce I get past a certain number of rows in a partition, the query starts to fail with a timeout error since it seems to be using a fixed timeout value.p  pBut Im in no hurry for the aggregate query to return results, and Id like the coordinator node to take its time and aggregate all the rows without timing out.  Id also like to throttle the rate at which it pages through the results so that it doesnt generate excessive load while doing the aggregation.p  pSo is there a way to set a timeout and throttling rate for queries that are emexpectedem to take a long time to executep  pRight now Im thinking the only workaround is to design my schema so that I keep my partitions artificially small to keep the aggregation under the fixed timeout limit.p  pIm running the Cassandra 3.0 alpha code base.p

Negative 1391 pI have a problem with my Test Plan. If I add User Defined Variable, lets say csrftoken and assign NOTINITIALIZED to it in User Defined Variables config element, it is passed to http request where it is referenced, but not set in prior http request sampler that has a regular expression extractor child element, that is supposed to set it, which means it is passed as NOTINITIALIZED. If I dont use User Defined Variables config element to declare it, I cannot reference it in later http request, that is, it stays like csrftoken, although it should be setcreated by previous http request and its post processing regexp Extractor, since it properly references the name. I think, there might be some problem with the scope, but I cant figure what. Everything is within the same Transaction Controller, nothing changes if I place everything directly at the Thread Group level. What am I missing Thanks in advance.p

Negative 1391 pI have a table called pages which I use for several things, including the navigation of the site. Within that table I have pagenames, parentid, navidset to 1 if it is in the nav, otherwise 0 and dont count it , and navorder which dictates the order. I am currently ripping through the table pulling all parents then doing a select statement to pull all children  if they exist  for that parent to make the dropdown for the nav. If there are 8 parents and each have children that could end up being a lot of select statements every time the page loads.

Negative 1391 pI have 2 small local arrays  p  precodeshort int xpLeft [4], xpRight [4] codepre  pThe moment I make them strongglobalstrong to access them in different method, but only within same C file e.g. not accessible to other modules, the performance on Motorola 68000 drops.  Instead of 224 vblanks for local, the whole benchmark renders 320 frames of a scene suddenly takes 249 vblanks global array p  pWhat I triedbr Since the data in the arrays were not used in that function, I though that compiler caught that and did not bother with writing the resulting value from register to the memory an extremely slow operation on 68000  accessing the memory. So, I added some small code to use those array values at the end of the function, and it raised the performance cost accordingly just 1 vblank.p  pWhat would helpbr I need to examine the final ASM code and compare both versions, but am unusure how to do that using strongvbcc compilerstrong from Dr. Volker. I tried few switches from the documentation, and while they did produce some intermediate output, I could not get it to provide a full ASM listing of each module with the function names from C.  p  pI just got the switch k to work. Apparently, the order of the switches matters, and I found a place in the command line where its recognized and I finally got the .ASM output with over 300 thousands lines no less, but I finally have something ASM with symbols to dig through.p  pWhat I think is happening  p  ol limaking arrays global puts them into different address in RAM, and the memory controller has to access different bank, and the bank switch is an extremely slow operation on the target platform  resulting in RAS charge cycles to access different row of addresses.li lipointer aliasing  its possible the compiler generates different code, and might actually access the actual memory for intermediate     results  but if I had the ASM output for each function, I could     figure that out easilyli ol  pAny tips on why this is happening or how to get the vbcc output full listing of each compiled module with corresponding ASM code   p  pWith the ASM output I created a small test repro case  p  precodeshort int tmpfn1       short int xpLeft [4], xpRight [4]     short int i, tmp      for i  0 i lt 4 i              xpLeft [i]  137  i         xpRight [i]  215  i           tmp  xpLeft [0]  xpRight [0]     return tmp  codepre  pHere is the resulting ASM.
