Positive 35275 pIm not at all familiar with VBA scripts, but Ive tried a few scripts found here and elsewhere online without a lot of luck.p  pCurrently I have a form where a user can press an Export Report command button, which opens a prompt asking for an [AgencyID] a 5 digit id number.

Positive 35275 pLets say I have a single access file or two files split into a file with data and a frontend file.

The most significant differences are in terms of p  ul liCost amp Time  li liNeed to rewrite the access database to be in SQL Serverli liNeed to rewrite the front end li liConcurrent use.li liScalability of solution and performance.li liUse SQL Server to store the data.li liSimplicityli ul  pHeres the options as I see it.  p  pstrong1. Create a desktop front end file linked to the sql server data.strong  p  pEach user has their own copy on the PC of the front end file.  You manage your own SQL Server database  instance yourself or use MS Azure or similar web service.  There is a free version of SQL Server that can be installed and used on a server, or you can us p  pPROS You dont need to rewrite you front end file.p  pCONS You need a SQL Server instance.  You need to migrate your data tables and you may need to do some work to replicate them in SQL Server, especially if you have data macros, or use special data types like YesNo, Multipel select combo boxes and a few others.  There are free tools that do most of the migration and paid for ones that do more.p  pstrong2. Store a file on dropbox or similar and facilitate sharingstrong p  pThis works if ONLY one user will ever need to UPDATE the database at a time.p  pStore the file on dropbox and use a vbscript like that described a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions19328371canishareanmsaccessdatabaseapplicationviadropboxherea to grab the file from dropbox to the local disk, allow the user to update it, then put it back to dropbox.  A mechanism is used to stop other users grabbing the file IF another user has grabbed it..  This approach could be adapted to allow users to grab the file for READ ONLY purposes if another user has grabbed it for updating.p  pNote that this method minimises the need to rewrite the database and can use free online file storage to facilitate sharingp  pNote that 2 could be modified to Auto update a front end file stored on a users PC as suggested in option 1.p  pPROS Cheap Minimal changes. p  pCONS Only one user updating at a time. You need to write fairly complex VB scripts.  You need to manually set up dropbox for each user and its sync to c drive.p  pstrong3. Use Access 2010 to create a Web app.strong  The data gets stored in Sharepoint lists, and the forms use macros to respond to the users actions.  Info a hrefhttpssupport.office.comeniearticleBuildanAccessdatabasetoshareontheWebcca08e358e5145ce92698942b0deab26toc262221095 relnofollowherea and video demo a hrefhttpswww.youtube.comwatchvAU4mH0jPntI relnofollowhereap  pCONS An old school way of doing it  Access 2013 is better.p  pstrong4. Use Access 2013 web apps.strong This stores the data in SQL Server and uses new Access features to provides a web GUI ie Views.  You can also access the same SQL Server data from a desktop access front end for reporting etc.p  pCONS for 3 amp 4 p  pThe forms that you create do not have as good functionality as a desktop front end as VBA cannot be used  macros are used instead.  But this can be ok in many cases.  p  pA sharepoint subscription is required and this may stop your database being widely available as most of the users will need sharepoint accounts.  p  pYou will probably need to rewrite your existing access forms. PROS More scalable as SQL Server is used.  Easy to create and manage using Access.p  pstrong5. Use a virtual hosted desktop server.strong  a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions32643313microsoftaccessdatabasecloudoptions3264853732648537mentioned herea  eg a hrefhttpsaws.amazon.com relnofollowAmazon Web servicesa.p  pI need help with this.  As I understand it this might be quite costly.  I have questions likep  p5a  Does each user need to subscribe to their own workspace Do these workspaces need MS Accessoffice licenses  eg If so Amazons would be 40usermonth, or can you just use an Access runtime so Amazon would only be 25usermonth. p  p5b. Can each users workspace link to the same access data file stored on a fileserver or can one workspace get to another workspaces files.  There are costs for having a fielserver.p  pstrong6. Use third party software.strongp  peg 50usermonth a hrefhttpeqldata.comonweb relnofollowEQL Data plugina claims to be able to Run unmodified Access applications, right inside a web browser.p  pCONS Expensive  PROS Might be easier than other methods above.p  pstrong7. STOP using MS Access and write or rewrite the whole database using another language.strongp  pThis is always an option.  My main question here is if you are proficient at Access and a VB or C, will creating the same app. in Access be quicker than in VB, java, C etc.  Mates of mine write apps in JAVA and it takes them ages to do things that I can do in Access in minutes.  Also, the great thing about Access is that its often end users that create the database for themselves and it gives them what they need.p  pstrong8. Upsize the data from Access to SharePointstrongp  pExcept from SO a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions28422670splitmsaccessdatabaseandstorebackendinsharepoint3266467432664674hereap  pYou can upsize the data from Access to SharePoint or low cost office 365. SharePoint tables now support relational data, so basic master to child tables and cascade delete is supported when you move Access tables up to SharePoint you are however limited to PR of auto number, and child records foreign keys must be a long number.p  pDepending on the size and number of rows of data, the above solution is OFTEN better then moving tables up to SQL server. A VERY nice feature of this setup is that your application can continue to run without any internet connection. The instant you find some WiFi etc., then your data syncs.p  pSo I would not write off the SharePoint tables option, as they can work VERY well with many kinds of Access applications, including ones with related tables. And the off line mode can be great for those laptops in the field without an internet connection.p  pstrong9. Use remote control softwarestrong like a hrefhttpwww.teamviewer.com relnofollowteamViewera to allow use of a remote PC and hence the the database.  Only allows one user at a timep

Positive 35275 pI am analyzing a series of reports in an Access database.  Currently, this project is nonfunctional as the data is in SQL Server and I dont have permissions to it at the moment. Some of the reports have recordsource and filter set programmatically and others are set using the properties  data tab. One of my colleagues offhandedly mentioned that he thinks report filters may not be applied when the reports are called programmatically if they are set using the properties  data tab. Of course, he said that and then wandered off and now Im not sure how to verify this. Is this the case Can anyone point me to documentation on thisp

Positive 35275 pI am converting an excel spreadsheet over to an Access database.  I am new to Access, though I have taken a couple of courses through a local training company.  In the spreadsheet that I am converting, we currently use a tracking number that identifies each main record which would be in my new main table that is in the format of YYXXXX where YY is the current 2digit year and XXXX is a sequence number that begins at 0001 and could go up to 9999 each year.  So, the last record of 2014 might have been 141025, and the first record of 2015 is 150001.p  pFor consistency sake with my old data, I would like to use the same numbering system.  I know I can generate a standard autonumber as the primary key and I may do that as well anyway, but I want to have this YYXXXX field automatically sequence when I create a new record in a form.  So, how might you recommend an approach to do this  p  pMy first thought is to create and merge two strings, one that converts the current date to a two digit text field and the other an autonumber for the sequence  I have played around with this and havent been able to get anything to work.  I am not too good at VBA code, so it has all been just trying to create tables, fields and expressions.  But maybe VBA is the only way to do it.p  pWhile I dont know how to do this, one acceptable option might include using an autonumber that is six digits long and is just formatted with a dash after the first two digits, along with a way to easily restart the numbering, i.e. on Jan 1 of next year, set the autonumber to 160001 formatted as 160001. p  pAny great ideas out there p

Positive 35275 pAs I saw many of the Login Systems Database got a field for a series of Constrained ID arranged, it rises me up the question for my Login System Database Design, is that necessary.p  pThe problem is, assume there is a register system, when the user registers an account, the codeaccount namecode is already unique, as the system will warn you for unavailable codeaccount namecode, because they are repeated in the database. So do we need a constrained ID arrangement for each successful register Even though it allows repeated codeaccount namecode, cant we just use the users codeID card no.code as the unique field p  pOr assume there is no register system, the admin allocate the account, we can still use their codeID card no.code as the unique field.p  pIt is not like there will be search efficiency or wellorganized data structure. We do not identity record by the arrangement, but the unique field. There will also be redundancy if there is already another Unique field.p  pSo far my Login System requires the codeMemberIDcode and codePasswordcode to login, codeMemberIDcode is the constrained ID arrangement allocated by the system, which makes me think should I let the user create their whole codeaccount namecode or codeID card no.code and remove the codeMemberIDcode.p  pDid I misunderstand the usage of them Or is there a reason for it Did a good data design need such constrained unique ID p

Starting it as release build from a console application in 32 bit mode it needs more than 12 minutes. Im just instantiating a codenew DbEnginecode and later call codeOpenTablenamecode per table to fill and table.Update per row to insert no updates, inserts only. The assembly references codeMicrosoft.Office.interop.access.dao.dllcode version 15.0.4420.1017 Access 2010.p  pIm looking for a clue where to start digging for the reason for these massive discrepancy. p  pstrongEDITstrong Basically, its a copy job from SQLServer to an access db, thus it first reads the data via ADO from SQLServer and than inserts this into the accdb. Like this not the exact codep  precodeforeachvar tableName in tables    readSqlIntoArraytablename, tableData   var daoTable  daoDb.OpenTabletableName   foreachvar row in tableData         ... add new record and copy data      daoTable.Update   this is the expensive call in console app     codepre  pThe unit test just creates the parameters for the copy job, creates the relevant object and starts the job. The console app does right the same. Profiling, timing and debugging always lead to codetable.Updatecode being the call with most cost. The SQL read shows no differences and ist therefor ruled out as cause of the problem.p  pThe reason for asking here was actually, that I need an idea, where I can further investigate, since the code itself shows no obvious differences.p  pThere is no reflection, generics, unsafe code or hidden artifacts in the calling methods runner vs console app, that could explain such behavior, since both of them only build the runtime parameters and call the job. I even compared these parameters by char. So I wondered, if there is some environmental difference between console app and VS test runner, since Im dealing with a COM object here.p

Negative 35275 pIn a web application like wiki or forums or blogging software, it is often useful to store your data in a relational database.

Negative 35275 pWe recently had a security audit and it exposed several weaknesses in the systems that are in place here.  One of the tasks that resulted from it is that we need to update our partner credentials system make it more secure.  p  pThe old way of doing things was to generate a bad password, give it to the partner with an ID and then they would send that ID and a Base 64 encoded copy of that password in with all of their XML requests over https.  We then decode them and validate them.p  pThese passwords wont change because then our partners would have to make codingconfig changes to change them and coordinating password expirations with hundreds of partners for multiple environments would be a nightmare and they dont have to be entered by a human or human readable.  I am open to changing this if there is a better but still relatively simple implementation for our partners.p  pBasically it comes down to two things I need a more secure Java password generation system and to ensure that they are transmitted in a secure way.p  pIve found a few handrolled password generators but nothing that really stood out as a standard way to do this maybe for good reason.  There may also be a more secure way to transmit them than simple Base 64 encoding over https.  p  pWhat would you do for the password generator and do you think that the transmission method in place is secure enough for itp  pEdit The XML comes in a SOAP message and the credentials are in the header not in the XML itself.  Also, since the passwords are a oneoff operation for each partner when we set them up were not too worried about efficiency of the generator.p

The NSString name member is set fine everytime, however if I use an NSInteger, then whenever I try to set number I get an EXCBADACCESS. So I tried using an int instead. But now I cant use keyvalue programming and need to look for the node manuallyp  precodeif[elementName isEqualToStringnumber]      aChild.number  [currentElementValue intValue]  codepre  pThis is okay, I can deal with that because I know what nodes Ill be getting, but it gets worse.

For instancep  precode    NSLogNSMutableString Value , and intValue dn, currentElementValue, [currentElementValue intValue]   Value will be 123 but intValue will be 0 codepre  pSo I made currentElementValue an NSString instead of an NSMutableString and I can get the proper intValue. But I read online that the reason it is an NSMutableString is because thep  precode voidparserNSXMLParser parser foundCharactersNSString string codepre  pDelegate used to set the value emcanem occur more than once, but typically does not.

Negative 35275 pBefore I begin I have spent a long time on many forums including Stack Overflow  and yes there are a lot of SO questions on organizing svn, searching Google, and reading documents I own a few Subversion books.  I still have not found a good way to organize our code base in Subversion.  We currently use RCS as our revision control system, and emeverythingem is stored in 1 RCS directory  Ugly, I know  thats why I am working towards something better.  I have also used Subversion a lot, so I know its capabilities and how it works.  I have hesitated asking this question for months, since it is not completely programming related, but since I havent been able to come to a solution, what better place to ask my questionp  pWhat complicates things in my head is the subversion term Project.  If I want to manage a java project in subversion, this makes perfect sense to me all of the java files that get combined into a jar file could be considered a Project  they all belong together.  However, in our environment, I do not see an easy way to define what a project is.  We have over 4,000 programs, and all of them are pretty much independant of each other.  Many of them are shell scripts or perl scripts.  Some of our scripts use generic utility or library scripts, but for the most part, all code objects are indepenant.p  pOne Project in our environment could involve program A,B, and C, and config file AA.  Another project could use programs C,D, and E, and config file BB.  Yet another project could just be changing config file AA, or maybe program B.  There is not a way to classify which programs or files belong in a group.  Because of this  I have no idea how to organize our code into subversion.  I could put everything into a master project trunk, but then checking out a working copy means checking out all 4,000 elements.p  pTo give some context, this is for a Data Warehouse.  All 4,000 code elements are needed to make the warehouse function.  Maybe a certain business requirement comes in that requires changes of a column that is accessed in a few of the elements, and another business requirement requires changes to a few other elements maybe some of the same from the other project.p  pMaybe Subversion isnt the best fit for us, although I have to believe it can work.  We already have a Subversion server for our web code and our Java programs, and it works great, because there are easily defined projects.  I just cant figure out how to organize our main code library.p  pHopefully some of that made sense...  Thanks in advance for your wisdomp
Negative 35275 pI see a lot of J2EE developers put labels in property files but dont use different Locales.  So, you get a lot of missing property exceptions.  And the main thing is that it makes it hard to debug and read a JSP page.

Negative 35275 pI am attempting to create the the business and data layers for my big ASP.NET MVC application.  As this is the first time for me attempting a project of this scale I am reading some books and trying to take good care at separating things out properly.  Usually my applications mix the business logic and data access layers, and multiple business entities are intertwined in the single class which has confused me a few times when I was trying to figure out where to add things.p  pMost of what I have been reading is to separate out the business and data layers.   This seems all fine and dandy, but I am having trouble visualizing exactly how to do this in some scenarios. For example, lets say I am creating a system that allows admins to add a new product to the systemp  precodepublic class Product      public int Id  get private set     public string Name  get set     public decimal Price  get set   codepre  pThen I separate out the data access by creating a repositoryp  precodepublic class ProductRepository     public bool AddProduct product  codepre  pLets say I want to require a products name to have at least 4 characters.  I cant see how to do this cleanly.  p  pOne idea I had was to expand the Names set property and only set it if its 4 characters long.  However, there is no way for a method that is creating the product to know the name didnt get set except that Product.Name  whatever they passed in.p  pAnother idea I had is to put it in the Add method in the repository, but then I have my business logic right there with the data logic, which also means if the Add call fails I dont know if it failed for the business logic or because the DAL failed and it also means I cant test it using mock frameworks.  p  pThe only thing I can think of is to put my DAL stuff in a 3rd layer that gets called from the Add method in the repository, but I dont see this in any of the domain modelling examples in my book or on the web that Ive seen at least.  It also adds to the complexity of the domain models when I am not sure it is needed.p  pAnother example is wanting to make sure that a Name is only used by one product.  Would this go in the Product class, ProductRepository Add method, or wherep  pAs a side note, I plan to use NHibernate as my ORM however, to accomplish what I want it theoretically shouldnt matter what ORM I am using since TDD should be able to isolate it all.p  pThanks in advancep

Negative 35275 pHi  stackoverflow family.p  pIt is doubtless that unit testing is of great importance in software development. But i think it is practice and philosophy which is test first. And majority of developers  want to  use  this philosophy, but they cant perform it on their project because  they arent  used to Test Driven Development. Now my  question is for those who follow this philosophy. What are the properties of the good test according to your experiences And  how you enable it to be a part of your lives.p  pGood days.p

Negative 35275 pThe application Im writing performs a length algorithm which usually takes a few minutes to finish. During this time Id like to show the user a progress bar which indicates how much of the algorithm is done as precisely as possible.p  pThe algorithm is divided into several steps, each with its own typical timing. For instance  p  ul liinitialization 500 millisecli lireading inputs 5 secli listep 1 30 secli listep 2 3 minutesli liwriting outputs 7 secli lishutting down 10 millisecli ul  pEach step can report its progress quite easily by setting the range its working on, say [0 to 150] and then reporting the value it completed in its main loop.p  pWhat I currently have set up is a scheme of nested progress monitors which form a sort of implicit tree of progress reporting.p  pAll progress monitors inherit from an interface codeIProgressMonitorcodep  precodeclass IProgressMonitor  public   void setRangeint from, int to  0   void setValueint v  0  codepre  pThe root of the tree is the ProgressMonitor which is connected to the actual GUI interfacep  precodeclass GUIBarProgressMonitor  public IProgressMonitor     GUIBarProgressMonitorProgressBarWidget   codepre  pAny other node in the tree are monitors which take control of a piece of the parent progressp  precodeclass SubProgressMonitor  public IProgressMonitor    SubProgressMonitorIProgressMonitor parent, int parentFrom, int parentLength   ...  codepre  pA codeSubProgressMonitorcode takes control of the range code[parentFrom, parentFromparentLength]code of its parent.p  pWith this scheme I am able to statically divide the top level progress according to the expected relative portion of each step in the global timing. Each step can then be further subdivided into pieces etcp  pThe main disadvantage of this is that the division is static and it gets painful to make changes according to variables which are discovered at run time.p  pSo the question are there any known design patterns for progress monitoring which solve this issuep

Negative 35275 pI have this Windows Forms application where it sits in the notification area. Clicking on the icon brings it up front, clicking it again or clicking on the app X icon sends it back. This is the type of app that having the window always on top is important when its displayed by clicking the icon its optional though.p  pRightclicking the icon brings up a context menu where one can select to enable the always on top option or not. When the application first starts up, the app settings are read from an XML file and Im 99 that this is working as it should, the codeTopMostcode property is properly read and written.p  pAfter some time minutes, hours, days, whatever I normally hibernate and rarely shutdown the codeTopMostcode emstops workingem. I dont change the option, I dont think anything is changing the option value but I click the notification area icon and app is not brought up front. It shows up but its on the background it displays on AltTab, its not always on top as it should. I bring up the context menu, disable the option cause its enabled and enable it back and it starts to work after that. The app is now always on top. However, it can lose this ability anytime after a while.p  pI cant understand why this happens and how this happens. Does anyone have any idea why If not, any idea how could I try to debug such behaviorp  pstrongEDITstrongbr I added a piece of code to show a MessageBox when the codeTopMostcode property was changed to see if I could notice any strange behavior but it was no good.

Negative 35275 h3Problem descriptionh3  pIm working on a project to take an existing JavaScript script and modify it to support being loaded asynchronously. If you dont know about asynchronous or lazy loading scripts but want to learn more a hrefhttpfriendlybit.comjslazyloadingasyncronousjavascript relnofollowread thisa. p  pOne of the first things our main.js script does is call our webserver 3rd party to our clients to get some dynamic data. Which is the problem because that data is return via a dynamically added JS file data.js, which contains variables that are needed in other parts of main.js. The problem is similar to the issue described in chapter 5 of the book a hrefhttpbooks.google.combooksidE7p07kNfXYCampprintsecfrontcoverampdqEvenFasterWebSitesampsourceblampotsULipSGfeQrampsigGjCWGok0n2CDAmcumPtAUIx2xkamphlenampei5I5ITMatHIOosQPWo9FIampsaXampoibookresultampctresultampresnum7ampved0CDwQ6AEwBgvonepageampqampffalse relnofollowEven Faster web sitesa.  Which deals with coupling inline scripts with async scripts.  Anyway...  The problem being that main.js doesnt know when data.js has finished loading...p  pCurrently main.loadDataJs uses the emDocument.write Script Tagem technique to dynamically load our JS file, but this doesnt work for async scripts for anyone who hasnt tried it it results in a blank page after loading.  So, we have to use the emScript Dom Elementem technique of loading data.js dynamically.  The problem here is figuring out when the browser has downloaded and executed the added script node.  So Im looking for a method of coupling data.js with the async script main.js.p  pMy priority is to build something that is reliable on both PC browsers and mobile browsers. It has to have a very small and light weight footprint, because the amount of data being returned by data.js is pretty small about 510 keyvalue pairs. It has to support 3rd party communication. p  pbrhr p  h3Solutions Im investigatingh3  ul liFrom my own research, Im leaning towards modifying the server code that serves up data.js to support JSONP.  That is when we set the src attribute of the script object the call would have a callback parameter codesrcdata.jscallbackfooCallbackcode that causes the data to be wrapped in a function call, like so codefooCallback  geoC   US  code.  From my experimenting this seems to be the most reliable solution, since it isnt browser dependent.  Deploying serverside code means greatly increasing the scope of the project, but Cest la vie.li ul  pI also experimented withp  ul lipUsing a polling Timer.  Which checks for the data to exist and if so call the callback function, else calls setTimeout again. My problem with this solution is that it isnt event driven so it doesnt respond as quickly as I like, and it causes the browsers busy indicator to activate.  So if data.js takes a long time to download or fails, it could look busy for a long time.pli lipUsing the script blocks onload and onreadystatechange handlers.  This would have been a perfect solution except for two issues I hit. brstrongAstrong On a fast machine using IE8, I was able to get the onreadstatechange to fire the codes.readyState  loadedcode event before it had executed data.js, I assume it was downloaded but still being executed .  I was able to fix this by adding a codesetTimeoutfooCallBack, 1code call inside the onreadystatechange handler.  But Im not a 100 happy with that solution. brstrongBstrong I have read but havent tested yet that this technique doesnt work on IE6 minus. Any comments pli ul  pI looked into other nondynamicJavaScript solutions but they all seemed heavier handed than I was looking for.  Like the a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenusarchitecturebb735305.aspx relnofollowiframea or flash techniques used by Facebook and others.p  pbrhrp  h3My Questionsh3  pFrom anyone who has coupled async scripts together, Im curious what solutions you choose and how reliable you have found themp  pIs there some alternative solution I havent talked about p  pAny general comments on anything Ive talked aboutp  pbrhrp  h3Definitionsh3  pThe definitions of the techniques are borrowed from Steve Souderss book a hrefhttpbooks.google.combooksidE7p07kNfXYCampprintsecfrontcoverampdqEvenFasterWebSitesampsourceblampotsULipSGfeQrampsigGjCWGok0n2CDAmcumPtAUIx2xkamphlenampei5I5ITMatHIOosQPWo9FIampsaXampoibookresultampctresultampresnum7ampved0CDwQ6AEwBgvonepageampqampffalse relnofollowEven Faster web sitesa.

Negative 35275 pIm trying to build an Eclipse RCP application, and in the process, were trying to set the application to automatically update.  Were trying to have it automatically set the right preferences in the Preferences  InstallUpdate  Automatic Updates page.  p  pIve set all of the preferences I want in the plugincustomization.ini file for our .product such as org.eclipse.equinox.p2.ui.sdk.schedulerdownloadtrue, and almost all of them work.  However, one preference seems to not get set automatically this is the org.eclipse.equinox.p2.ui.sdk.schedulerenabled preference the one referred to by the Automatically find new updates and notify me checkbox on the AutomaticUpdatesPreferencePage.  Digging into the source code, I understand why it doesnt set it correctly, but Im not sure how to get around it.p  pHeres essentially why it doesnt work In the last line of the AutomaticUpdatePlugin.start method, it callsp  precodePreferenceInitializer.migratePreferences codepre  pAs its the start method for the plugin, this occurs before any of the preferences are read from the plugincustomization.ini.  migratePreferences tries to migrate this preference, which was in a different place in 3.4 and 3.3.  Inside AutomaticUpdatePlugin, theres a hidden migrated34Prefs preference which checks to see if its performed this migration this migration sets the value of the enabled preference to false, so if I could somehow stop it from performing this migration since I know theres going to be no migration from 3.3 or 3.4, as were just built on top of 3.5, everything would work fine.  The default value is set correctly via the plugincustomization.ini, but the actual value is still false i.e. if I hit restore defaults on that preference page after opening the RCP the first time, the box goes from unchecked to checked.  p  pBecause this all occurs in the start method, I cant simply set the value of migrated34Prefs to true in the plugincustomization, because that wont even be read in until after the migration has already occurred.  I know what the problem is, but I cant quite see the last step to make it so that this will be enabled by default.  Is there something else I can set, or some other workaround that I havent been able to findp

Negative 35275 pI am trying to remove an ImageButtons background in only the default state. Id like the pressed and selected states to behave as usual so that they look correct on different devices, which use different colors for the pressed and selected states.p  pIs there any way to set an ImageButtons background default states drawable without affecting the pressed and selected statesp  pIve tried to do this with a selector, but it does not appear to allow you to use the default drawables for some states  you have to set all the states yourself. Since theres no API to retrieve the devices default pressedselected drawables, I dont know what to set the pressedselected states to.p  pI also tried getting the StateListDrawable object for the button that the system creates when you are not using a selector and then modify it change the default state. That didnt work either.p  pI seems that on Android, if you want to change the drawable for one state of a button, then you must set all the states, and thus cannot preserve the default drawables for the other states. Is this correctp  pThanks Tom B.p

Negative 35275 pBR So basically we have an strongnames strongly signed assembly x.dll which is used by one of our components, App.exe. The signing key of the assembly is in our repository and it the assembly is signed by means of writing p  precode[assembly AssemblyDelaySignfalse] [assembly AssemblyKeyFileAttribute....xxx.snk] [assembly AssemblyKeyName] codepre  pThe assembly is supposed to be put in GAC by some installer which installs common packages, lets name it common.msi. But our component itself is installed by App.msi. When deployed together, everything works. But when changes are made to App.msi, ones that have ABSOLUTELY nothing to do with x.dll, and App.msi is redeployed, App.exe fails to find x.dll. Note that no changs are made to x.dll. When, however, common.msi is deployed as well, everything works. So I am guessing there must be an issue with build versions or something, or manifests which I know nothing about. Is there something obvious that I am doing wrong Isnt it possible to just deploy the assembly separately and not touch it unless it is changed and not redeploy it every time a component that uses it is changed Thanks.p  pstrongEdit It is a requirement one I cant do anything about that the ssembly be put in GACstrongp

Negative 35275 pWe have written an Outlook addin in C, that appends a custom header to outgoing messages.p  pThis addin has to use a library called Redemption to bypass Outlooks security to modify the headers, and this is all working great.p  pOur problem lies when sending outgoing mail through an exchange server.

My question is, is there a way to automatically generate new lists whenever one is in use For example in Solitaire, lets say Ive already put at least one card into each holder. The user interface would then know to create a new category next to the last used one. I hope this makes sensep  pMany thanks.p

Negative 35275 pI tried searching this on Google and didnt really learn anything as the search results usually pertain to other recursive subjects. What I would like to know is if a folder is in Path is it defined recursivelyOn Windows I want to create a CStandalonePrograms and add that to path. It will contain a bunch of programming languages and other programs that usually come from zip files. I want to know that if by adding the program directory to it I can call all of the programs. For example if I have CStandaloneProgramsSomeProgram can I open up a command prompt type codesomeCommandcode and expect it to run from the CStandaloneProgramsSomeProgrambin folder Or do I need to explicitly define CStandaloneProgramsSomeProgrambin in my Path If I cant is there any workarounds to achieve the situation I wantp
Negative 35275 pI am trying to learn Free Pascal using Lazarus and one of my pet projects involves reading the 64 byte headers of a particular set of untyped files that cannot be read and displayed using text or ASCII related procedures so cannot be outputted directly to Memo boxes etc. p  pSo far, I have devised the following code which does, I think, read in the 64 bytes of the header and I am using TStreams and a Select Directory dialog box to do this, based on advice received via the Lazarus IRC. My question though is how to actually USE the data that is read into the buffer from the header For example, in the headers, there are sequences of 8 bytes, then 16 bytes, then 2 bytes and so on that I want to work on to generate other output that will eventually be converted to a string to go into my string grid. p  pSome of what I have so far is based on what I found here written by Mason Wheeler near the end httpstackoverflow.comquestions455790fastreadwritefromfileindelphi but it only shows how to read it in, not how to use it. I also read this httpstackoverflow.comquestions4309739bestwaytoreadparseauntypedbinaryfileindelphi but again, it shows you how to READ the data too, but not subsequently USE the data. Any guidance wamrly received So far, the code below just outputs single value integer numbers to the edit box, as opposed to, say, a range of 8 hexadecimal values. p  pPS  I am new to programming so please be gentle Nothing too complex. p  precodeprocedure TForm1.ProbeFileFileIterator TFileIterator  type  TMyHeader  Array[1..64] of packed record  First8Bytes,  Next16Bytes,  Next2Bytes byte  end  var    FI  TFileIterator                      File Iterator class   SG  TStringGrid   NumRead  SmallInt   FileToProbe TStream   header TMyHeader  begin   FI  TFileIterator.Create   SG  TStringGrid.Createself      Open the file and read the header   FileToProbe  TFileStream.CreateFileIterator.FileName, fmOpenRead   try     FileToProbe.seek0, soFromBeginning     FileToProbe.ReadBufferheader, SizeOfheader     edit1.text  IntToStrheader[0].First8Bytes   Just outputs 0 to the field  If I try 10 it ooutputs 29 and so on   finally     FileToProbe.Free   end  codepre

Negative 35275 pHey guys, Im implementing a Table View into my project. First I populated my table, then I manage to successfully create 4 categories and give a number of rows in each of those categories, but heres my problem. The first category which has 7 objects is working fine when each data in that category opens their own nib files. But on the second category which has 3 objects, the 3 objects are actually opening nib files from the first category, which is not what I want. I created and assigned each objects in my Table View their own nib files to open, but like I said the objects from the second and also the third and fourth categories are opening the nib files from the first category. Heres my code how I separate the objects in my Table Viewp  precodepragma mark  pragma mark Table view data source   NSIntegernumberOfSectionsInTableViewUITableView tableView       Return the number of sections.     return 4    Category  NSString tableViewUITableView tableView titleForHeaderInSectionNSIntegersection      if section  0 return Category 1     if section  1 return Category 2     if section  2 return Category 3     if section  3 return Category 4     return Other    NSIntegertableViewUITableView tableView numberOfRowsInSectionNSIntegersection       Return the number of rows in the section.     if section  0 return 7     if section  1 return 3     if section  2 return 6     if section  3 return 5     return 0    Customize the appearance of table view cells.

Negative 35275 pFirst Ill admit Im very new at coding GUIs with Swing so please keep that in mind.p  pI have made a GUI consisting of a JPanel on top that is supposed to display images, and one of the bottom containing several GUI components making up a chat. I have the chat all taken care of though you are welcome to point out mistakes and improvements. My concern right now is the handling of the images in the upper JPanel.p  pMy understanding is that when dealing with images it is wise to extend JPanel into a new class that paints images to the GUI. Ive written such a class based on other answers Ive found on this sitep  precodeclass ImgPanel extends JPanel       private URL rUrl     private BufferedImage img        public ImgPanelString filename          super         try              rUrl  getClass.getResourcefilename             if rUrl  null                  img  ImageIO.readrUrl                       catch IOException ex              System.out.printlnCouldnt find image file   filename                    Override     protected void paintComponentGraphics g          this.setSize240, 320 If I do not set the size of the ImgPanel manually                                 it for some reason gets the dimension 10, 10 and                                 all the images are shrunk to fit it. Without this                                  line though, the images do not stack and are                                 displayed as would be expected from flowLayout.         g.drawImageimg, 0, 0, getWidth, getHeight, this        codepre  pAs can be seen above I have commented on the part that I suspect is the problem. My GUI class looks like thisp  precodepublic class ClientGUI extends JFrame      private JTextArea chatwindow     private JList users     private JTextField enterChat     private JPanel draftMonitor     private JPanel chatMonitor     private JPanel chatLeft     private DefaultListModel listModel      public ClientGUI         superClient         setLayoutnew BorderLayout          chatwindow  new JTextArea         chatwindow.setEditablefalse         chatwindow.setRows15         chatwindow.setWrapStyleWordtrue         DefaultCaret caret  DefaultCaretchatwindow.getCaret         caret.setUpdatePolicyDefaultCaret.ALWAYSUPDATE          listModel  new DefaultListModel         users  new JListlistModel         users.setVisibleRowCount15         users.setPrototypeCellValueAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA                      The above line is what I used to set the width of the JList,                     it has nothing to do with the question at hand, but I know                      there must be plenty of ways to improve this rather crude                      piece of coding.          enterChat  new JTextField          chatLeft  new JPanel         chatLeft.setLayoutnew BorderLayout         chatLeft.addenterChat,South         chatLeft.addnew JScrollPanechatwindow,Center          chatMonitor  new JPanel         chatMonitor.setLayoutnew BorderLayout         chatMonitor.addnew JScrollPaneusers,East         chatMonitor.addchatLeft,Center          draftMonitor  new JPanel         draftMonitor.setLayoutnew FlowLayout         draftMonitor.addnew ImgPanelexampleimage.jpg         draftMonitor.addnew ImgPanelexampleimage.jpg         draftMonitor.addnew ImgPanelexampleimage.jpg         draftMonitor.addnew ImgPanelexampleimage.jpg         draftMonitor.addnew ImgPanelexampleimage.jpg         draftMonitor.addnew ImgPanelexampleimage.jpg         draftMonitor.addnew ImgPanelexampleimage.jpg         draftMonitor.addnew ImgPanelexampleimage.jpg         draftMonitor.addnew ImgPanelexampleimage.jpg           getContentPane.addchatMonitor,South         getContentPane.adddraftMonitor,Center           public JTextArea getChatWindow         return chatwindow          public JTextField getEnterChat         return enterChat          public JList getUsers         return users          public DefaultListModel getListModel         return listModel        codepre  pThis produces nine copys of the example image, each slightly more to the right than the other ten pixels but stacked on top of eachother with the leftmost one on top. Theyre not centered, theyre slightly to the right visibly so.p  pWithout the suspect line in the ImgPanel class it produces what I would expect, nine images in a spaced out row, centered. However they are much smaller than the actual size of the source image.p  pIm thankful for all the help I can get, this GUI coding is tricky businessp

Negative 35275 pIm new to ios development and to stackoverflow. I did try searching both stackoverflow and google before posting.p  pI built a simple little app, originally just left it an iphone only app, but decided to make it universal in the end. I, stupidly, was messing around when i was getting to know xcode 4 and switched it to universal and then back again so i had to recopy the project and do it again. This time i started it with a universal app. Not when i created it but after i went to project and selected it there It created the ipad folder and mainwindowipad.xib file but was empty of course since i didnt do anything yet. I had it set up as a tabbed based app so my iphone version had firstview and secondview nib files also, but the ipad version didnt. I set it all up in iphone version first and it worked fine. I then went and laid down the ipad version i did eliminate the second tab from mainwindowipad because i didnt need itp  pi then went and created a new nib file and placed it in the ipad folder along with mainipad.h and mainipad.m. I copied my code and connected everything and it runs fine on ipad simulator but now when i try and run iphone simulator i get SIGABRT error. I took a screen shot of it. I dont fully understand objectivec so i was hoping someone can help me I can post any code or whatever you might need to help me with this error so just ask.p  pAppreciate any help and suggestions you may havep  pThanksp  p[Okay i would have posted image but I cant since Im a new user, instead i posted the line highlighted and the output from xcode]p  pCode for file with errorp  precodeint mainint argc, char argv[]      NSAutoreleasePool pool  [[NSAutoreleasePool alloc] init]     int retVal  UIApplicationMainargc, argv, nil, nil ERROR IS ON THIS LINE lt     [pool release]     return retVal  codepre  p[OUTPUT]  p  precode20110618 173243.980 Price Assist[445207]  Terminating app due to uncaught exception NSUnknownKeyException, reason [ltUIViewController 0x4e09cc0gt setValueforUndefinedKey] this class is not key value codingcompliant for the key finallabel.

Negative 35275 pIve been given the rather daunting task of introducing i18n to a J2EE web application using the 2.3 servlet specification. The application is very large and has been in active development for over 8 years.p  pAs such, I want to get things right the first time so I can limit the amount of time I need to scrawl through JSPs, JavaScript files, servlets and wherever else, replacing hardcoded strings with values from message bundles.p  pThere is no framework being used here. How can I approach supporting i18n. Note that I want to have a single JSP per view that loads text from a properties files and not a different JSP for each supported locale.p  pI guess my main question is whether I can set the locale somewhere in the backend i.e. read locale from user profile on login and store value in session and then expect that the JSP pages will be able to correctly load the specified string from the correct properties file i.e. from messagesfr.properties when the locale is to French as opposed to adding logic to find the correct locale in each JSP.p  pAny ideas how I can approach thisp
Negative 35275 pso yesterday I asked a question and I thought I had gotten my answer as everything seemed to work fine. I come back today to try and run my program and find nothing happens, and this time I am not getting any errors at all.p  pTo give you an idea of things, Ive been looking to incorporate a Python Script a friend made for me into a Java application that I am trying to develop. After some trial and error I finally found out about Jython and used the PythonInterpreter to try and run the script. p  pHowever, upon trying to run it, I was getting an error within the Python Script. This was resolved by a suggestion a member of SO provided to change the thisDir  getcwd, or so I thought. Now I have no clue what could be wrong, the script works fine and does exactly what I need it to extract all the images from the .docx files stored in its same directory when I run it directly from the command line, so I dont know.

That being the case, it still cycles through the do while loops once before calling that method.p  pI cannot for the life of me figure this out. Its probably something pretty simple I am missing.

System.out.printlnPlease enter a number greater than 0.              saleAmount  input.nextDouble          codepre  pIt still isnt working correctly. Changing the loops to while loops certainly worked, but now when I enter a number for the invoice number thats in the correct range and an incorrect number for the saleAmount, the program finished and does not execute the while loop for saleAmount I seem to be missing a concept here.p  pAlso, can anyone recommend a better IDE than JGrasp. That is what we were told to use, but its cumbersome. I have VisualStudio and Eclipse, but I feel that doing java homework in those two IDEs might be overkill. I will be taking more java courses and c courses, so maybe its worth learning the basics in VS or Eclipse. Any suggestions would be appreciated.p

Negative 35275 pIm setting up a new .NET 4.0 WCF service with a method operation that takes strongly typed XSD generated data types as parameters. This makes things clean and tidy for the client  the client can work with strong types and not have to think about XML.p  pHowever, in the implementation of the WCF service, I would prefer to deal with the parameter data as XML documents LINQ XDocument instead of the deserialized object types. Its nice that WCF will deserialize to explicit types, but for my generic algorithm its more convenient and more flexible to deal with the xml documents instead, primarily because the incoming data is polymorphic.p  pI know I can just take the parameter objects and serialize them back down to XML, but this seems wasteful. p  pI understand that I could probably replace the strongly typed params with XElement to get what I want for implementation convenience, but this will lose the benefits of strong typing compiler checks, intellisense, self documentation for the client.p  pIs there any way to tell WCF that in my service implementation I dont need the parameter objects deserialized, that I want them as XML instead  p  pOr, is there a way to access the raw XML of the params as they were prior to WCF deserializing them into objects If I cant prevent WCF from spending time deserializing the objects at least this would avoid the cost of reserializing them back to XML.p

Negative 35275 pI have a generic question about tableview Draw and reload data, and wanted some insight from this scenario. I have a tableView which gets lazily loaded getting the data parsed from a url. Now the concern is when i select a button and move to another view, I can deselect the object from there, which will remove it from the array. Thus, when I go back to the main view of the tableView, it downloads the data again and checks if the object of the further view array is there or not, therefore it set it selected the button.p  pMy concern is, when I go back, my previous selected button is highlighted, and then it does all the computation and deselects it when the data gets loaded. Is there anyway, I can have the tableView redrawn until the data loads everytime p  pThanks.p

Negative 35275 pWell, I thought I had this one solved.  I simply changed the TreeViewItems template to ignore whether a particular node was expanded or not.  Looks great  But thats just it... it emlooksem great  Keyboard navigation still responds as if the node was expanded or collapsed.p  pFor instance, if Im on the root node and hit the right arrow nothing moves, nor should it then hit down, I go to the first child of the root.  However, if Im on the root node and hit left again, nothing moves then hit down, I jump to the second root node, jumping over all the first nodes childrenp  pNeedless to say thats not the behavior we want.  We could simply swallow the left and right arrow keys, or simply abandon the treeview entirely and move to nested items presenters which is sort of what a TreeView does anyway but Im hoping I dont have to recreate an entire control just for this functionality.

Id like to provide the admin with the ability to swap the position of one video in a playlist with another video in that same playlist, through the changeupdate form of the model above from my admin.pyp  precodeclass WeeklyPlaylistAdminadmin.ModelAdmin     ...     readonlyfields  position,     form  WeeklyPlaylistAdminForm      def getchangelistformself, request, objNone, kwargs         return WeeklyPlaylistAdminForm codepre  pand Im defining my own form for this object still from admin.pyp  precodeclass WeeklyPlaylistAdminFormModelForm     class Meta         model  WeeklyPlaylist         fields  position,      swapwithposition  forms.IntegerFieldwidgetforms.SelectchoicesWeeklyPlaylist.getposchoices      def cleanswapwithpositionself         swapwithposition  self.cleaneddata[swapwithposition]         instance  getattrself, instance, None         if instance and instance.id and swapwithposition  self.instance.position             raise forms.ValidationErrorYou must specify a different position than the actual one.           select the database obj to swap position with         other  WeeklyPlaylist.objects.filterschedscreennameself.instance.sched.screen.name, schedyearexactself.instance.sched.year, weekself.instance.week, positionswapwithposition         if other.count  1             raise forms.ValidationErrorThe desired position does not correspond to any existing WeeklyPlaylist entry.          return swapwithposition codepre  pWhat I had in my mind basically was to provide an extra select html tag to the admin in the changeupdate form of the WeeklyPlaylist model where he could enter the new position in the playlist for the current video, with the necessary checks in the associated clean method to make sure the desired playlist position is valid. So far so good. Now, my problem is the following when the admin clicks on the save button, how can I simultaneously save the modified object, and the one it is exchanging its position with Ive tried doing this in the save method of the form, using the following codep  precodedef saveself, commitTrue, args, kwargs     m  superWeeklyPlaylistAdminForm, self.savecommitFalse, args, kwargs     cleaneddata  self.cleaneddata     swapwithposition  cleaneddata.getswapwithposition     if commit          select the database obj to swap position with         other  WeeklyPlaylist.objects.getschedscreennamem.sched.screen.name, schedyearexactm.sched.year, weekm.week, positionswapwithposition         m.position, other.position  other.position, m.position         m.save         other.save     return m codepre  pThat seems perfectly fine, except that for some reason, commit is always false, even though m is saved after the operation is finished, which is something I dont understand. But as a consequence, other.save is never called, and if I remove the if statement checking the value of commit, I wont be able to do a savecommitFalse on the WeeklyPlaylistAdminForm objects, which can be annoying... So, any suggestions to help me Many thanks in advance Cheers Adrienp

Negative 35275 pI am generating very large hex grids up to 120k total hexes at 32px wide hexes results in over 12k wide images and Im trying to find an efficient way to bind these to OpenGL textures in libgdx. I was thinking of using multiple FBOs and breaking the grid up as necessary into tiles, but Im not sure how to ensure continuity between the FBOs. I cant start with one massive FBO, because that is backed up by a texture so it would fail from trying to load it to video memory. I cant use a standard bitmap on the heap because I need the drawing functionality of an OpenGL surface.p  pSo what I was thinking was I would need to overdraw on the FBOs and somehow pick up on the next FBO emexactlyem where the previous left off. However Im not sure how to go about this. Im drawing the hex grid with a series of hexagonal meshes, FYI.p  pOf course, theres probably some other much simpler and more efficient way to do this that Im not even thinking of, which is why I pose this question to you fine peoplep

Negative 35275 pI have a main task to develop a library that I split up to get it more manageable. Basically I have a template class for vectors and matrices, several classes that use these two, the main library that uses all of these classes and a Demo application that uses the library to display the features and test them.p  pThe demo application is a Qtcdt project. The library is a pure cdt project. The vector and matrix class are one cdt project. Each of the other classes have an own cdt project.p  pNow I am mainly developing the library and want to see the results in the demo application. So the main development cycle is to change the source of the library and recompile the demo application.p  pMy problem is How to setup the projects builds to have only to rebuild the files necessary and link them accordingly.p  pMy first approach was to include all the source files of all projects including the library in the demo application. That worked but did not trigger on updated files in the library so I head to clean and build everything again each time. p  pAfter this I thought of building the library statically and then linking it into the source file, while referencing the projects. This triggered recompilation at the right place but it seems that the new binary files were not linked into the executable.p  pBasically the question is How should I arrange all those files to have a clear layout not everything in one project, build the right things and not everything if necessary and link them into the executable in case there were changes.p  pstrongSide notestrong Another problem with project referencing was, that the template classes were compiled in their project which led to distracting error messages.p  pstrongEditstrong To give a better understanding of the directory layoutp  precodeeclipseworkspace     demoapplication        .cproject        .project        main.cpp        somewidget.h        somewidget.cpp        demoapplication.pro        ...     mainlibrary        .cproject        .project        class1header.h        class1implementation.cpp        class2header.h        class2implementation.cpp        ...     ...     vectormatrix        .cproject        .project        vector.h        vector.cpp        matrix.h        matrix.cpp        ... codepre  pEach project depends on the projects beneath it.p

Negative 35275 pI have a semaphore that I tried to change the value of and it fails. After reading the codemancode page I learned that if the value is less than 0 and you use codeSETVALcode it will fail I wasnt initializing it.

I am not sure if it is referring to the codeSETALLcode or the union.p  pMy initialization looks like thisp  precodeunion semun argument  unsigned short values[1]  values[0]  1  argument.array  values  int retVal  INITIALIZE our semaphore ifretVal  semctlsemId, 0, SETALL, argument  1      perrorsemaphore INITIALIZATION failedn     exit1  codepre  pI have my union declared just like the man page and several other websites do and I have a check after codesemgetcode to make sure it returns a semaphore so I know that part is working correctly.

Negative 35275 pI think I understand OSPF  it is LinkState routing, with a domain split into different areas.p  pHaving one area as the backbone obviously creates a hierarchy, but I thought that the point of hierarchies was to decrease the amount of information that each individual node stored, and I dont understand how OSPF does that.p  pFrom what I understand from Computer Networks, A Systems Approach, is that routers on the border to the backbone area ABRs collect routing information about their outer area, then advertise this to the routers in the backbone with the simplified costs, and then this is forwarded out to all of the other areas.p  pSo from that, we still have the same amount of information in every router the next hop to get to every other router, its just that weve changed the costs, and forced all outer area communication to go through the backbone.p  pIs this true If so, what is the point of splitting it up into domains. If not, could you please point out where Ive gone wrong.p  pThanks alot.p

Negative 35275 pAm integrating APNS in my iPhone app. I have walked through on Apple Push Notification document provided from Apple. I have a doubt on server side. Please find my doubts below,p  precode  1. Apple said to create a server from below steps,      Installing the SSL Certificate and Key on the Server     You should install the SSL distribution certificate and private cryptographic key you obtained earlier on the server computer on which the provider code runs and from which it connects with the sandbox or production versions of APNs. To do so, complete the following steps     1.1.Open Keychain Access utility and click the My Certificates category in the left pane.     1.2.Find the certificate you want to install and disclose its contents.

Negative 35275 pIve noticed that in trying to get seemingly simple node packages to install with npm e.g. a hrefhttpsgithub.comgjritternerve relnofollownervea, a microframework I often run into some form of dependency pain. After some digging, I tracked down the problem with nerve to the a hrefhttpsgithub.comncb000gtnode.bcrypt.js relnofollowbcrypta module, which is apparently written in CC and has to be compiled after the package manager downloads it.p  pUnfortunately, it seems like if you want this to work on Windows, the answer is from one of the bcrypt issues threads install a Linux VM. So earlier today I did just that, and started running into other dependencies you need a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions3329355nodejscouldnotconfigureacxxcompilerubuntucertain unnamed apt packagesa installed before you can even think about building, despite GCC being installed, then eventually after seeing yet another C compiler error about some package or other not being able to find Arrays.c I think, I actually gave up, and switched from nerve to express instead. Ironically, the larger and more complicated express installs with npm on Linux and Windows without a single issue.p  pSo, my question is is there any filter  dependency tracking available that lets you see if a package has additional dependencies besides node core Because to me the allure of node is everything in Javascript, and this kind of stuff dispels the illusion quite unpleasantly. In fact, despite having done more than my time working with CC, whenever I see a requirement to make something these days I generally run in the other direction screaming. p

First, Ive dumped the output to a file to get a sense of the data Ill be working with and here is moreorless how they look likep  precodeFuncCall1    FuncCall2       FuncCall3       FuncRet3       FuncCall4       FuncRet4       FuncCall5         FuncCall6         FuncRet6       FuncRet5     FuncRet2 FuncRet1 codepre  pTo have a better visual understanding of how this data looks like, here is a graph of the first 10000 function calls xaxis time, yaxis depthnesting img srchttpimg444.imageshack.usimg4444710proflog.gif altFunction CallReturn graph httpimg444.imageshack.usimg4444710proflog.gifp  pWhen a function begins execution, I will log its nameidentifier and the current highprecision timestamp and when it returns I will need to lookup the entry where I stored the start time and add a new timestamp that marks it return.p  pTo sum things up, the operations that Im going to perform on these data arep  ol liInsert a new function call mark with current timestamp.li liLookup the most recent function call of a certain ID and store the return timestamp.li liSee which other functions were called from within a certain function and see where its spending its time  for example If Im looking at Function2 in the previous example, I want to know that it calls Function3, Function4, Function5 and Function5 calls Function6 then it returns with all callreturn timestamps marked.li ol  pNow, I have several ideas for datastructures that might be good for this scenariop  ol lipAn autobalanced tree i.e AVL where the key for each node will be the function identifier and the value in each node would be a stack of timestamp pairs. This approach will give me fast insertion and lookup when marking function timestamps and the fact that each node is a stack, it will also take care of matching the right return timestamp to the start timestamp  Always I assume the latest return timestamp of a certain function should match the most nestedrecent function call. In this approach, maintaining nested function calls with different identifiers would be a bit troublesome, because I will have to traverse the tree and match them basing on their timestamp to figure out their nesting  not ideal.pli lipMaintain a list of functions that did not return yet that will preserve the callstack info and use skiplist where each level would be equal to functioncallnesting level. This approach would make operation 3 easier, but lookups will be slower and I might have to maintain very long lists of not returned functions  such as main, that will have to be maintained throughout the lifetime of my application. Here I could also use a hashtable, to improve the lookup speed sacrificing some more memory usage. Memory usage is critical  this profiler easily generates about 20 MB  s.pli ol  pThe reason why Im not using a plainsimple stack to track these data, is because I will need to periodically sync partial results to a different machines and have at least, partialresults available before everything returns.p  pIve looked over intervaltrees, rangetrees and other kind of datastructures that Im aware of, but I cant find any that would meet all my 3 requirements efficiently.p  pMaybe there is a data structure that would meet them all that Im not aware of Any Ideasp  h2Updateh2  pWhat about thisp  pHaving a tree that would have function calls along with their nested calls and a separate stack for the functions that did not return. p  pNow every element on the stack will have a pointer to its copy in the tree and when a new function call arrives, I will look at the top element on the stack, trace its pointer to its representation in the tree, add the new function call as a child to that call and push its copy on the stack with a pointer to the newly created tree node.p  pFor function returns, its similar, for every function return, the latest entry on the stack will always be its call  trace the call pointer, save the return time in the tree and pop the call.p  pDo you see any major flaws in my thinkingp  h2Update 2h2  pMy Approach worked perfectly. I will wait 2 days and answer my question.p

Negative 35275 pI am fairly new to Python programming and Threads isnt my area of expertise. I have a problem for which i would hope that people here can help me out with.p  pstrongTaskstrong as a part of my master thesis, i need to make a mixed reality game which involves multiplayer capability. in my game design, each player can set a bunch of traps, each of which is active for a specific time period e.g. 30 secs. In order to maintain a consistent game state across all the players, all the time check needs to be done on the server side, which is implemented in Python. p  pI decided to start a python thread, everytime a new trap is laid by a player and run a timer on the thread. All this part is fine, but the real problem arises when i need to notify the main thread that the time is up for this particular trap, so that i can communicate the same to the client android device. p  pi tried creating a queue and inserting information into the queue when the task is done, but i cant do a queue.join since it will put the main thread on hold till the task is done and this is not what i need nor is it ideal in my case, since the main thread is constantly communicating with the client and if it is halted, then all the communication with the players will come to a standstill.p  pI need the secondary thread, which is running a timer, to tell the main thread, as soon as the time runs out that the time has run out and send the ID of the trap, so that i can pass this information to the android client to remove it. How can i achieve this p  pAny other suggestions on how this task can be achieved without starting a gazillion threads, are also welcome..  p  pThanks in advance for the help..p  pCheersp

In the console, a message is displayed saying codeLinked script not loadedcode.p  pI believe that this message and the lack of a request is triggered by Operas CrossNetwork Security, which is described in a hrefhttpmy.opera.comsecuritygroupblog20120703operascrossnetworkprotection relnofollowthis blog posta. On Stackexchange, a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions5464599operawontloadsomejavascriptfiles74429987442998this answera suggests a workaround, but it requires user interaction. For my use case, the browsers are started, stopped, and run by a script, so user interaction isnt an option.p  pIs there a way to disable this crossnetwork security in Opera completely, or for pages loaded from a particular trusted host I need a change that I can make in the preferences or codeoperaconfigcode that will be sticky across sessions. All of these computers are running on an internal network on internally controlled pages, so Im not worried about crossnetwork attacks.p

Negative 35275 pIm trying to build an ATL program using the MS command line tools from the Windows SDK 7.1.

Negative 35275 pIm using a DataGrid in a form to show a list of userID, name, balances, etc.. There is a very strange issue with it, at the beginning of some rows one out of very twenty rows there is a small white space that is causing that row to be misaligned.

This happens only when I programmatically scroll my DataGrid, after the scroll is done the white spaces appear.p  pWhat makes things worse is that the white space is resizable and when I resize it with my mouse it screws up the grid.

Negative 35275 pIm writing an application that deals with very large usergenerated input files. The program will copy about 95 percent of the file, effectively duplicating it and switching a few words and values in the copy, and then appending the copy in chunks to the original file, such that each block consisting of between 10 and 50 lines in the original is followed by the copied and modified block, and then the next original block, and so on. The usergenerated input conforms to a certain format, and it is highly unlikely that any line in the original file is longer than 100 characters long.p  pWhich would be the better approachp  ol lipTo use one file pointer and use variables that hold the current position of how much has been read and where to write to, seeking the file pointer back and forth to read and write orpli lipTo use multiple file pointers, one for reading and one for writing.pli ol  pI am mostly concerned with the efficiency of the program, as the input files will reach up to 25,000 lines, each about 50 characters long.p

Negative 35275 pIve worked with various ORMs and database abstractions designed to make it easy to work with multiple databases, both relational and not. The more comprehensive solutions will usually give you access to some date functions that boil down to actual SQL or whatever, in the case of nonSQL dbs. On the other hand, many of these abstractions dont provide direct access to SQL functions and you lose the ability to deal with dates directly. Instead, youre expected to use the upperlevel language PHP, Python, whatever to do your datewrangling, and finally only insert, select, whathaveyou the formatted date.p  pSo my question is this if the SQL server never gets to do anything with the date itself, am I better off just using an int and putting epoch timestamps in it, or is there additional value to the database server knowing its a datep

Negative 35275 pI use a UIScrollView to display a PDF file. Scrolling horizontally changes the page. This works fine, but when the next page is a full sized image, the scrollview stucks before starting to animate the scrolling. This is normal behavior.p  pI want to display an activity indicator when the duration exceeds e.g. one second to improve the feedback to the user.p  pI have already tried the naive way of starting a timer that starts the indicator after one second. It does not show up, I assume that it is queued on the same thread as the UI activity changing the page that takes so long. I also tried to use performSelectorOnMainThread for starting the indicator but that was a weak guess and did not help.p  pMy understanding of the threading in iOS is the problem here. I can only guess, that I have to interrupt the page change, execute the start of the activity indicator, and then go on changing rendering the page. I have no idea how to do that. Id appreciate one.p

Negative 35275 pI im trying to authorize a user for some connections in SignalR, my issue is that using WebSockets as the transport i cannot set HttpContext.Current.User without getting an exception. The authorization object also needs to be accessible from the controller and there also the authentication is custom throughout the webapi portion with an IFilter implementaion.p  pI must be missing something here, before we upgraded to a 2012 server that supports websockets we simply used HttpContext.Current.User and everything worked fine, Looking at alternatives through SignalR, there is an implementation for [AuthorizeAttribute] but only for Hubs and im not sure that changing HttpContext.Current.User there will not throw an exception as well when working with websockets.p  pThanks in advance,   Totem.p

Negative 35275 pI am working on a project in which time precision for multiple users with different timezones is extremely important. p  pI know the most accurate representation of the timezone to store would be its identifier eg EuropeBudapestp  pbut using DateTimeZonelistAbbreviations AND DateTimeZonelistIdentifiers, I got 408 timezones cities, which is not very user friendly to be used in a select box.p  pIn order to make it more user friendly, I would need to put them in groups of timezones where they share the same offset and daylight saving.p  pI cant group them based on Offset because they change with daylight saving, or Timezone abbreviation eg AST which could contain elements of multiple offsets.p  pI see websites which are also very time sensitive, but they offer timezone selection in groups which are very user friendly and I wonder how do they group them or do they sacrifice accuracy for user friendliness.p  pis there a way to do this that I am not aware ofp

Negative 35275 pstrongFIXstrong  Just putting cursor pointer in the keyframe selection fixed the problem.

The image has a css codecursorpointercode style and an codeonclickdocument.locationa urlreturn falsecode functionality.

Negative 35275 pI have been reading the a hrefhttpdiveintohtml5.infooffline.html relnofollowchapter on offlinea in Dive Into HTML5, and it has left me with some questions.p  pIt saysp  blockquote   pEvery time you make a change to one of the resources in your offline web application, youll need to change the cache manifest file itself. This can be as simple as changing a single character. The easiest way Ive found to accomplish this is to include a comment line with a revision number. Change the revision number in the comment, then the web server will return the newly changed cache manifest file, your browser will notice that the contents of the file have changed, and it will kick off the process to redownload all the resources listed in the manifest.p blockquote  pBut lets take the Wikipedia example that is discussed in the same article. Whenever an article is edited, the manifest file must be changed to reflect the edit, and any user that has stored pages offline will lose them because they are not explicitly mentioned in the manifest. Is this really desirable behaviour If yes, why not do the followingp  ol liStore files in the offline cache until they are deleted explicitly, even when the manifest changesli liUpdate files in the cache when they are changed e.g., when the server does not return a 304 Not modifiedli ol  pIf one were to get the behaviour described in the above two points, what would be his options Use local storage or somethingp

Negative 35275 pI am working on an iOS application where I have two separate buttons that call, and display a UIViewController from an .xib file.  When this viewController is displayed for the user, the user enters data, and then dismisses the viewController, and is taken back to the main application where heshe originally came from.  My problem right now is that this viewController that is called, and then dismissed by the user is activated by two different buttons, and the data that is entered by the user has to be kept track based on which button calls it.  However, in creating and calling the viewController, I honestly dont know how to pass the tag value from the buttons which would distinguish which button is calling it.  p  pHere is my code which creates and calls the viewController from the .xib file and is called by both buttonsp  precode IBActionbuttonClickedidsender       nextView  [[NextViewController alloc] initWithNibNameNextViewController bundlenil]     [nextView setDelegateidself]     NextNavigationController navigationController  [[NextNavigationController alloc] initWithRootViewControllernextView]     [self presentViewControllernavigationController animatedYES completionnil]   codepre  pThis code works fine in calling the viewController, but I also need to pass with it the tag value from the button which calls this method.

Negative 35275 pIm building a responsive website from the ground up for use as a SharePoint 2013 masterpage, using a hrefhttpskeljs.org relnofollowskel.jsa to control the grid and breakpoints. Once published, the js files codeskel.min.jscode, codeskelpanels.min.jscode, codejquery.min.jscode, codehtml5shiv.jscode, and a simple codeconfig.jscode written by me to configure skel and skelpanels do not reliably run every time a user hits the site, leaving the CSS frozen at whatever breakpoint the browser matched at the time. A refresh emusuallyem fixes the issue, but thats not an acceptable solution. So far this happens in IE, Chrome and FF all versions that dont trigger codehtml5shivcode.p  pDoes anyone have experience troubleshooting skeljs, or know of a higherlevel cause for this behavior Im not proficient enough with JavaScript to figure this one out for myself, but even a push in the right direction would be appreciated.p  pstrongUpdatestrong Caught one of the errors in IE Developer Tools IE10. The console reports codeSCRIPT5007 Unable to get property match of undefined or null referencecode and points to codeskelpanels.min.jscode at line 25 character 484.

Im continuing to try catching all of them in all browsers.p  pstrongUpdate 2strong As requested, here are the calls to the js files in the head.

When it works, both instances of codebcode come out to be 6u which is a class from skel.min.js that defines the width of a section within a row. When the script fails, only the first instance of codebcode is recorded and it is undefined.p  pstrongUpdate 3strong Per the suggestions of multiple people I tried loading the js at the end of the page, but this broke all of the scripts. After doing some more reading I decided to rearrange the order of the css and script links so that the css loaded first. What Ive come to find out though is that modern browsers use speculative parsing, so the order shouldnt matter. I confirmed this by seeing no noticeable change in behavior when loading the page. For reference though, the scripts come first about halfway down right after the default scripts that SharePoint calls, then the css is linked at the bottom of the codeheadcode. I still have not found a resolution to this issue, so any suggestions are welcomep

Negative 35275 pI have two problems that are related to each other. p  pThe first is that I want to have a folder named backbone, and that collides with having backbone as a short name for the library in the path. It seems that RequireJS thinks that backbonemodelUser is a child of the backbone library or something. Solution, name the library Backbone with capital B.p  pThe second problem is that Im using ModelBinder, which has backbone as a dependency. Solution, change the minified file.p  pBoth solutions seems like a bad hack for not doing something right in RequireJS configuration, but I cant figure out what Im doing wrong.p  pMy public folder structure is something likep  precodepublic   js     backbone       model         ...       view         ...     vendor       backbone.min.js       Backbone.ModelBinder.js       ...   common.js codepre  pMy common.js has something like thisp  precoderequire.config     baseUrl js,     shim          underscore              exports          ,         Backbone               deps [underscore, jquery],             exports Backbone               ,     paths          underscore vendorunderscore.min,         jquery vendorjquery,         modelbinder vendorBackbone.ModelBinder,         Backbone vendorbackbone.min     codepre  pSo my two questions are How can I keep Backbone.ModelBinder as it is, and tell requirejs that when that library ask for backbone, its asking for jsvendorbackbone.min.js without polluting my global paths.p  pAnd why cant I use both backbone lowercase b in the path and have the directory p

Negative 35275 pI would like to find a Linux based tool that allows me to test a private 3rd party http based application. That is use a strongGETstrong or a strongPOSTstrong request and check how long it takes to get a response. I could also increase the txn per second and see the outcomes of failures and whether processing time on their end increase. I could write code to do this but Im pretty sure there is a tool to do this already I just cant find it. p  pJMeter seems overly complicated for the simple task Im trying to achieve. Selenium seems more for testing web borwser based applications. p  pAny assistance will be greatly appreciated.p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comkzGqt.png altenter image description herep

Negative 35275 pThis problem has me puzzled. I tried using a loop like this Basically I tried to get the first digit from the input and do the formula but it doesnt seem to work.

The International Standard   Book Number ISBN is a 10 digit code that uniquely specifies a book.   The rightmost digit is a checksum digit which can be uniquely   determined  from the other 9 digits from the condition that d1  2d2    3d3  ...  10d10 must be a multiple of 11 here di denotes the ith   digit from the right. The checksum digit d1 can be any value from 0   to 10 the ISBN convention  is to use the value X to denote 10.   Example the checksum digit corresponding to 020131452 is 5 since is   the only value of d1 between 0 and and 10 for which d1  22  35    44  51  63  71  80  92  100 is a multiple of 11. Create a   Java method ISBN that takes a 9digit integer as input, computes the   checksum, and returns the 10digit ISBN number. Create 3 JUnit test   cases to test your method.p blockquote  pI got it, thanks a lot everyonep

Negative 35275 pI have several JPA entities that have onetomany relationships to other entities and therefore contain Collection fields. Obviously, as per the standard bean pattern I have getter and setter methods for these Collections but it would also be useful to have methods to add and remove objectsentities from these collections. Would I be breaking bean conventions to add these methods to the entity class themselves If this is the case, what would be the best way of implementing these methods I do have Facade EJBs for each entity which I could use for this purpose but these are primarily concerned with DB access logic persist, remove, etc and obtaining data structures lists, etc rather than manipulating the entity itself.p
Negative 35275 pIm trying to understand the inner workings of the NativeAudio example that comes with the NDK. To do this Id like to step through the C code in a debug mode, but Ive been having several issues attempting to do this. Here are the steps I am takingp  p1 In Eclipse, File  New  Android Project from Existing Code. I select the NativeAudio directory and select the option to copy it to my workspace. No issues here, and if I select the project and Run, it runs on my connected Android device no problem.p  p2 I select the project and do Convert to a CC Project. Next I go into the Project Properties and use codendkbuild.cmdcode instead of codemakecode as the Build command. Again, no issues here, and if I buildrun the project it works fine.p  p3 I open the nativeaudiojni.c file in the CC Perspective. Here is where the problems start. Immediately I get a ton of errors referring to unresolved types. Now with these errors which did not exist before opening the file for editing I cannot buildrun the project. The only workaround I have found for this is to disable everything under Project Properties  CC General  Code Analysis. When I do this I am able to buildrun the project again.p  p4 Next, I set a breakpoint in the nativeaudiojni.c file, specifically in the codeselectClipcode function. I then follow the instructions found here a hrefhttptools.android.comrecentusingthendkplugin relnofollowhttptools.android.comrecentusingthendkplugina and add codeNDKBUILD1code to my Build command. Now when I try and build, I get this errorp  precodendkbuild.cmd NDKDEBUG1 all  [armeabi] Gdbserver       [armlinuxandroideabi4.6] libsarmeabigdbserver [armeabi] Gdbsetup        libsarmeabigdb.setup [armeabi] Compile thumb   nativeaudiojni lt nativeaudiojni.c jninativeaudiojni.c In function bqRecorderCallback jninativeaudiojni.c1365 error bqRecorderBufferQueue undeclared first use in this function jninativeaudiojni.c1365 note each undeclared identifier is reported only once for each function it appears in make.exe  [objlocalarmeabiobjsdebugnativeaudiojninativeaudiojni.o] Error 1 codepre  pIf I remove codeNDKDEBUG1code from the Build command this doesnt appear during build and the app runs fine.

However, when I include codeandroiddebuggabletruecode to my manifest file and click Debug, the same error as above occurs.p  pIm quite unfamiliar with JNINDK, and cant figure out the issues here.

Negative 35275 pIm currently working on some code that someone else has written and Im unsure of the efficiency of their method.

But Im trying to load a preexisting module into a new script and run this script from the command line. p  h2Codeh2  pI have a file called main.lua module that looks something like thisp  precodemodule ..., package.seeall  Load libraries requireluasql.postgres requireluasql.sqlite3  local connecttodb  function    if not globalcon then       env  assert luasql.postgres       globalcon  assert envconnectdatabasename, databaseUser, databasepassword, databaseserver          return true    else       return false     end end  updatewidget  function parm1, parm2, parm3   local connected  connecttodb            if connected then       do something else      return true   end end  end function. codepre  pIm now trying to create a test script for this module.  I have the following logic in a separate lua file p  precodepackage.path  usrsharemyappmain.lua local myobject  requiremain  print myobject.updatewidget codepre  h2Problemh2  pIm getting the following error when I try to run my test script p  precodeattempt to call field postgres a table value codepre  pThe line its failing on is in the connecttodb method where I try to create an environment variablep  precodeenv  assert luasql.postgres codepre  h2What Ive Tried so farh2  ol lipIve modified the codepackage.pathcode in my test script to match what is being used by main.lua.  I did so by executing main.lua the regular way  driven by a web app  and dumping out the contents of codepackage.pathcode to a log file.  Ive copied the path from the log file and used it as the codepackage.pathcode value in my test script... of course, I had to modify it by adding an additional entry  a path leading to main.lua.br But other than that, the package paths are the same. pli lipIve added print statements inside main.lua to prove that it is getting into the updatewidget method... and that its just failing trying to create the postgres.pli lipIve added the luasql.postgres library in the test script to see if that would help... like sop  precodepackage.path  varxappnamemain.lua  local pgdb  requireluasql.posgres  printpgdb myenv  assertlua.postgres  fails codepreli ol  pThe test script also dies trying to create this object... Im going to keep hunting around.  It must be a problem with the paths... but I cant see the difference between the path thats created when loaded by the web app, vs. what I have in the test script.  Im going to use a DIFF tool to compare for now. p  pAny suggestions would be appreciated. p  pThanks. p  pstrongEDIT 1strongp  pI definitely think its the path, although I cant see just yet whats wrong with here.  I created yet another test script lets call it test3.. but this time, I didnt explicitly  set the path by assigning values to package.path.  I just tried to include the luasql.postgres pacakge and use it the way the original test script does... and it works So heres code that works p  precodeluasql  require luasql.postgres local myenv  assert luasql.postgres printmyenv codepre  pBut this fails p  precodepackage.path  package.path .. usrsharemyappmain.lua  luasql  require luasql.postgres myenv  assert luasql.postgres printmyenv codepre  pAlso to greatwolfs point, I tried from interactive mode in lua... and my code works just fine. p  precodeLua 5.1.5  Copyright C 19942012 Lua.org, PUCRio gt pgdb  requireluasql.postgres gt printpgdb table 0x176cb228 gt myenvassertluasql.postgres gt printmyenv PostgreSQL environment 0x176c9d5c gt  codepre  pSo... heres the package.path variable from interactive modep  precodegt printpackage.path ..luausrlocalsharelua5.1.luausrlocalsharelua5.1init.luausrlocalliblua5.1.luausrlocalliblua5.1init.luausrsharelua5.1.luausrsharelua5.1init.lua gt  codepre  pAnd heres the path from my original test script where it fails.  p  blockquote   pusrsharemyappmain.lua..luausrlocalsharelua5.1.luausrlocalsharelua5.1init.luausrlocalliblua5.1.luausrlocalliblua5.1init.luausrsharelua5.1.luausrsharelua5.1init.luap blockquote

Negative 35275 pI need to create an executable that works with as many distributions as possible. I read a lot of information about this and I discovered that there are two ways static linking and dynamic linking. The first solution avoids bringing with the executable the libraries, but it has some problems with the licenses. The second solution appears the more suitable. With dynamic linking the linker adds to the executable ELF header all the references of the libraries which it needs and the operating system loads these libraries before executing the binary.p  pThe command codereadelf d ltbinarygtcode shows the needed librariesp  precodeDynamic section at offset 0x149d80 contains 33 entries Tag        Type                         NameValue 0x0000000000000001 NEEDED             Shared library [libopencvhighgui.so.2.4] 0x0000000000000001 NEEDED             Shared library [libopencvimgproc.so.2.4] 0x0000000000000001 NEEDED             Shared library [libopencvcore.so.2.4] 0x0000000000000001 NEEDED             Shared library [libstdc.so.6] 0x0000000000000001 NEEDED             Shared library [libm.so.6] 0x0000000000000001 NEEDED             Shared library [libgccs.so.1] 0x0000000000000001 NEEDED             Shared library [libpthread.so.0] 0x0000000000000001 NEEDED             Shared library [libc.so.6] 0x000000000000000f RPATH              Library rpath [ORIGINlib] codepre  pwhile the command codeldd ltbinarygtcode shows all the libraries called from my executablep  precodelinuxvdso.so.1 gt  0x00007fffbb14c000 libopencvhighgui.so.2.4 gt homeuser.liblibopencvhighgui.so.2.4 0x00007f19398d0000 libopencvimgproc.so.2.4 gt homeuser.liblibopencvimgproc.so.2.4 0x00007f1939410000 libopencvcore.so.2.4 gt homeuser.liblibopencvcore.so.2.4 0x00007f1938fb7000 libstdc.so.6 gt homeuser.liblibstdc.so.6 0x00007f1938cb3000 libm.so.6 gt homeuser.liblibm.so.6 0x00007f19389b7000 libgccs.so.1 gt homeuser.liblibgccs.so.1 0x00007f19387a0000 libpthread.so.0 gt homeuser.liblibpthread.so.0 0x00007f1938583000 libc.so.6 gt homeuser.liblibc.so.6 0x00007f19381c3000 libtiff.so.4 gt usrlibx8664linuxgnulibtiff.so.4 0x00007f1937f49000 libgstreamer0.10.so.0 gt usrlibx8664linuxgnulibgstreamer0.10.so.0 0x00007f1937c62000 libgobject2.0.so.0 gt usrlibx8664linuxgnulibgobject2.0.so.0 0x00007f1937a13000 libglib2.0.so.0 gt libx8664linuxgnulibglib2.0.so.0 0x00007f193771d000 libgstapp0.10.so.0 gt usrlibx8664linuxgnulibgstapp0.10.so.0 0x00007f1937511000 libgstvideo0.10.so.0 gt usrlibx8664linuxgnulibgstvideo0.10.so.0 0x00007f19372f5000 libdc1394.so.22 gt usrlibx8664linuxgnulibdc1394.so.22 0x00007f1937081000 libv4l1.so.0 gt usrlibx8664linuxgnulibv4l1.so.0 0x00007f1936e7b000 libavcodec.so.53 gt usrlibx8664linuxgnulibavcodec.so.53 0x00007f193606b000 libavformat.so.53 gt usrlibx8664linuxgnulibavformat.so.53 0x00007f1935d6a000 libavutil.so.51 gt usrlibx8664linuxgnulibavutil.so.51 0x00007f1935b4a000 libswscale.so.2 gt usrlibx8664linuxgnulibswscale.so.2 0x00007f1935904000 librt.so.1 gt libx8664linuxgnulibrt.so.1 0x00007f19356fb000 libgomp.so.1 gt usrlibx8664linuxgnulibgomp.so.1 0x00007f19354ec000 lib64ldlinuxx8664.so.2 0x00007f1939bca000 libjpeg.so.8 gt usrlibx8664linuxgnulibjpeg.so.8 0x00007f193529b000 libz.so.1 gt libx8664linuxgnulibz.so.1 0x00007f1935084000 libgmodule2.0.so.0 gt usrlibx8664linuxgnulibgmodule2.0.so.0 0x00007f1934e80000 libxml2.so.2 gt usrlibx8664linuxgnulibxml2.so.2 0x00007f1934b23000 libdl.so.2 gt libx8664linuxgnulibdl.so.2 0x00007f193491f000 libffi.so.6 gt usrlibx8664linuxgnulibffi.so.6 0x00007f1934717000 libpcre.so.3 gt libx8664linuxgnulibpcre.so.3 0x00007f19344d9000 libgstbase0.10.so.0 gt usrlibx8664linuxgnulibgstbase0.10.so.0 0x00007f1934286000 liborc0.4.so.0 gt usrlibx8664linuxgnuliborc0.4.so.0 0x00007f193400b000 libraw1394.so.11 gt usrlibx8664linuxgnulibraw1394.so.11 0x00007f1933dfb000 libusb1.0.so.0 gt libx8664linuxgnulibusb1.0.so.0 0x00007f1933bec000 libv4l2.so.0 gt usrlibx8664linuxgnulibv4l2.so.0 0x00007f19339e0000 libvpx.so.1 gt usrliblibvpx.so.1 0x00007f193373a000 libvorbisenc.so.2 gt usrlibx8664linuxgnulibvorbisenc.so.2 0x00007f193326b000 libvorbis.so.0 gt usrlibx8664linuxgnulibvorbis.so.0 0x00007f193303f000 libtheoraenc.so.1 gt usrlibx8664linuxgnulibtheoraenc.so.1 0x00007f1932e01000 libtheoradec.so.1 gt usrlibx8664linuxgnulibtheoradec.so.1 0x00007f1932be6000 libspeex.so.1 gt usrlibx8664linuxgnulibspeex.so.1 0x00007f19329cd000 libschroedinger1.0.so.0 gt usrliblibschroedinger1.0.so.0 0x00007f1932719000 libgsm.so.1 gt usrliblibgsm.so.1 0x00007f193250b000 libva.so.1 gt usrlibx8664linuxgnulibva.so.1 0x00007f19322f5000 libbz2.so.1.0 gt libx8664linuxgnulibbz2.so.1.0 0x00007f19320e4000 libv4lconvert.so.0 gt usrlibx8664linuxgnulibv4lconvert.so.0 0x00007f1931e6f000 libogg.so.0 gt usrlibx8664linuxgnulibogg.so.0 0x00007f1931c67000 codepre  pNow I have used the option of the linker to set RPATH Wl,rpath,ORIGINlib a hrefhttpen.wikipedia.orgwikiRpath relnofollowhttpen.wikipedia.orgwikiRpatha and so before the execution the linker looks as the first path the RPATH.

Negative 35275 pMy objective is to convert a 32bit bitmapBGRA buffer into png image in realtime using CC. To achieve it, i used  libpng library to convert bitmap buffer and then write into a png file. However it seemed to take huge time 5 secs to execute on target arm board quad core processor in single thread. On profiling, i found that libpng compression process deflate algorithm is taking more than 90 of time. So i tried to reduce it by using parallelization in some way. The end goal here is to get it done in less than 0.5 secs at least.p  pNow since a png can have multiple IDAT chunks, i thought of writing png with multiple IDATs in parallel. To write custom png file with multiple IDATs following methodology is adoptedp  precode   1. Write PNG IHDR chunk    2. Write IDAT chunks in parallel       i.   Split input buffer in 4 parts.       ii.  compress each part in parallel using zlib compress function.       iii. compute CRC of chunk  IDATzlib compressed data .       iv.  create IDAT chunk i.e.  IDATzlib compressed data CRC.       v.   Write length of IDAT chunk created.       vi.  Write complete chunk in sequence.    3. write IEND chunk codepre  pNow the problem is the png file created by this method is not valid or corrupted. Can somebody point outp  ol liWhat am I doing wrong li liIs there any fast implementation of zlib compress or multithreaded png creation, preferably in CCli liAny other alternate way to achieve target goal li ol  pNote The a hrefhttpwww.w3.orgTRPNG5Chunklayout relnofollowPNG specificationa is followed in creating chunksp  pUpdate     This method works for creating IDAT in parallelp  precode    1. add one filter byte before each row of input image.      2. split image in four equal parts. lt may not be required passing pointer to buffer and their offsets     3. Compress Image Parts in parallel             Afor first image part                 deflateinitzstrm,ZBESTSPEED                 deflatezstrm, ZFULLFLUSH                 deflateendzstrm                 store compressed buffer and its length                 store adler32 for current chunk, a1zstrmgtadler ltadler is of uncompressed data             Bfor second and third image part                 deflateinitzstrm,ZBESTSPEED                 deflatezstrm, ZFULLFLUSH                 deflateendzstrm                 store compressed buffer and its length                 strip first 2bytes, reduce length by 2                 store adler32 for current chunk zstrmgtadler,a2,a3 similar to A ltadler is of uncompressed data             C for last image part                 deflateinitzstrm,ZBESTSPEED                 deflatezstrm, ZFINISH                 deflateendzstrm                 store compressed buffer and its length                 strip first 2bytes and last 4bytes of buffer, reduce length by 6                 here last 4 bytes should be equal to ztrmgtadler,a4zstrmgtadler ltadler is of uncompressed data      4. adler32combine all four parts i.e. a1,a2,a3 amp a4 ltlast arg is length of uncompressed data used to calculate adler32 of 2nd arg     5. store total length of compressed buffers ltto be used in calculating CRC of complete IDAT amp to be written before IDaT in file     6.

The Arduino can then be recognized as a HDI  Midi device but is no longer programmable.pli lipWhen programming the ATmega328, the chip is being reset and on restart the bootloader will load and write the new program via its serial connection and the ATmega16u2bridge. The ISPinterface of the chip is not used for uploading the new program. Who is initiating the reset in the first placepli lipThe Arduino can be used as a ISPProgrammer to program other external chips. For that some firmware is loaded onto the AATmega328 an the ISPpins of the chip to be programmed are connected to the one on the Arduino board. Then the ArduinoIDE is configured to use the Atmega328 as a programmer rather than reprogram it.pli ol  pI hope, at least most of what I have written is correct. My questions then arep  pIf I put a newblank AVR onto my board, how does the bootloader get onto that chip How does the Burn Bootloader command workp  pIs it possible to upload a hex file to the ATmega328 WITHOUT uploading a bootloader first Can this be done by using speciaf firmware on the ATmega16u2p  pThanksp  pJohannesp

Negative 35275 pI apologize if this is an absolutely dunce question. I typically use Intellij Idea, and Im not quite so familiar with Eclipse, so maybe this is part of my problem. Im trying to compile a jar, Ive done the export, as jar file, and checked create .class files in the output options, I click finish, and it compiles the jar file for me in the output.p  pI go to check the .jar file open in Winrar and the .jar file contains a folder named src, with all the .java source code, and there are no .class files in the .jar file. I figured maybe I could just change the file extension, because I thought maybe it just didnt change the extension, but when I got to view the file, it is clear that it hasnt even been parsed, as it is still in source format.p  pI receive no compile errors when I try to export it in Eclipse. I do have build errors for the entire project, but Im not so worried about the entire project, I just wanted to compile one .jar file. And the build errors are not relating to the .jar file Im trying to build, they are related to other files. Is it necessary to fix every build error to compile one .jar file Im just not quite sure why it would compile with no build errors, and then not actually compile.p  pThank you in advance for any helpp

Negative 35275 pI am currently building a recognition program with cmu sphinx. I would like to take the speech query that is converted to text by sphinx and store it as a data file I was thinking either .txt file or .php [due to webserver using .php].  after the file is stored on the server, I already have the server taking the file, and giving me back the results I asked for works perfectly.   Just wanted some food for thought on how someone else would go about storing the text generated by sphinx, and what would be the most efficient file type like I said I think .php would be the best filetype due to webserver, but if someone else has an opinion feel free to share. when the data is received .xml format I will have a synthesizer output the data from the webserver.  I want the webserver to store past queries, and create a small offline server database.  I also want the webserver to have multiple users queries stored.p  pthank you for your time.  Look forward to any answers, or any food for thought.  Cheers  p

Negative 35275 pI want to test my C code in Visual Studio with unit tests. The code interacts with a MySQL database.p  pstrongAn example of what I want to teststrongbr A user opens my application and will be saved in the database via a webservice. Now I want to know if the table codeUserscode has one more row before the new user came.

Negative 35275 pIm not familiar with PostgreSQL functions and stored procedures, but Ive done my best to learn during the past few days. I tried hard before asking here.p  pBasically, I have a situation in which strongI cannot use simple SQLstrong and in which a function would be most helpful. That is because I am sending the query via AJAX to a Postgresbased webservice that returns JSONP, and, because the query is built in JavaScript based on a nonpredetermined number of variables, it can grow past the 2000 or so URL character limit allowed in MSIE.p  pSay, I have a table called strongclientsstrongp  precode    CLIENT     MONTHLYPURCHASES  SALESVALUE  RETURNSVALUE    Mercury Ltd  3                  400000       30000           Saturn Plc   11                 150000       30000           Uranus Ltd   4                  80000        1000            codepre  pThe query is supposed to return clients ranked by various criteria contained in the columns. The number of columns may grow in the future.p  pFor instance, if I want to get the top 10 best clients, ranked from 100 best to 0 worst, the SQL query would bep  precodeWITH var AS      we need the min and max values for each criteria, to calculate the rank later     SELECT        MINmonthlypurchases AS minpur,       MAXmonthlypurchases AS maxpur,       MINsalesvalue AS minsales,       MAXsalesvalue AS maxsales,       MINreturnsvalue AS minreturns,       MAXreturnsvalue AS maxreturns     FROM clients , standardise values to a 0 to 100 range, so we can compare apples with oranges, and assign weights to each criteria from 0 to 1 weights AS              SELECT client,       the higher the number of purchases the better. Weight 0.2 out of 1.       0.2  clients.monthlypurchases  var.minpur  var.maxpur  var.minpur  100 AS rnkpur,       the higher the value of sales, the better. Weight 0.4 out of 1.       0.4  clients.salesvalue  var.minsales  var.maxsales  var.minsales  100 AS rnksales,       the lower the value of returns the better. Weight 0.4 out of 1.       0.4  1  clients.returnsvalue  var.minreturns  var.maxreturns  var.minreturns  100 AS rnkreturns     FROM clients, var  SELECT weights.client, weights.rnkpur  weights.rnksales  weights.rnkreturns as overallrank FROM weights ORDER BY overallrank DESC LIMIT 10 codepre  pAll good, but in reality the number of columns is larger about 40, and the user could use at once anything between 1 and 15 for ranking.p  pAs such, the SQL route is not feasible. I tried creating a function which would at least do the standardisation of valuesp  precodeFirstly, a function to find the highest value in an array DROP FUNCTION IF EXISTS arraymaxfloat[]  CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION arraymaxfloat[] RETURNS float AS    select maxx from unnest1x order by 1  LANGUAGE sql  Secondly, a function to find the lowest value in an array DROP FUNCTION IF EXISTS arrayminfloat[]  CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION arrayminfloat[] RETURNS float AS    select minx from unnest1x order by 1  LANGUAGE sql  Finally, our function DROP FUNCTION IF EXISTS standardisefloat[], float  CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION standardisemyarray float[], val float RETURNS float AS   DECLARE   minimum float   maximum float   calcresult float BEGIN   minimum  arrayminmyarray   maximum  arraymaxmyarray    calcresult  val  minimum  maximum  minimum  100    RETURN calcresult END  LANGUAGE plpgsql IMMUTABLE codepre  pNot surprisingly, the function is pretty slow. If used like thisp  pre SELECT 0.5  standardiseSELECT arraySELECT salesvalue FROM clients, clients.salesvalue AS rnksales FROM clients pre  p... its acceptable. Anything that involves ordering slows it down to a crawl. I.ep  pre SELECT 0.5  standardiseSELECT arraySELECT salesvalue FROM clients, clients.salesvalue AS rnksales FROM clients ORDER BY rnksales LIMIT 10 pre  pIs there any way in which I can improve the speed of above function. Or, perhaps a totally different approach Any help would be much appreciated. Thanksp  pstrongUPDATEstrongp  pI ran EXPLAIN ANALYZE with the last query.

Negative 35275 pcomtypes are imported in pythonp  pWhen a cell is selected in excel file, selection property returns the correct range object and properties are accessible. But when a chart is activated or user selected then selection property does not return the correct object i.e. none of the chartObject, chart, chartArea objects, or for that matter when navigating inside the chart using arrow keys, selection doesnt provide the expected object I checked them trying to access their relevant properties. In fact I am not sure it is providing anything usefulp  pBut if I use ActiveChart property, it gives me the correct chart object and properties are accessible.p  pWhat could be the reason behind this and what is the solution.

Negative 35275 pWe have a rails 3.2 app that has quite a few database tables and we are hitting the database quite often.

Negative 35275 pI am looking for a weekend project to do and I was wondering if this was possible.  I have these radios that are programmed using Telnet to set the frequencies, output power, etc. and I normally do this with my computer in the terminal.  The radios have an RS232 connector on them and I use a USB converter to connect to my computer.  Having a small, portable device to program them with instead of a big, clunky laptop would be great, so what I am hoping is possible is to be able to create a telnet connection with my iPhone.  Is it possible to create a Telnet application for my iPhones that can connect to these radios through the USBlightning port on the iPhone  I know normally when people write Telnet applications for the iPhone, they are using over the air connections like WiFi3G4G to connect to the internet, but this radio is not connected to the internet but its own private network of other radios.  If it is possible to connect the iPhone to the RS232 port and accomplish the Telnet connection also without frying my iPhone with too much current that would be fantastic.  Also, if it is possible, how would I access the lightning port  Thanksp  pEDIT  Another possible connection is the iPhones lightning port to an RJ45 connection.  That would work as well.  Is this possible  Thanksp

Negative 35275 pCould you, please, look at the code below and give me your comments My major concern is that normally await is forbidden to be used inside the lock, so what I did instead I repeatedly used Monitor.Enter and Monitor.Exit. To me it looks fine. If an exception happens in the first Monitor.EnterExit block finally will release the object on the first thread. If it happens on the second block it should be normally released on the second thread. await is used in between Monitor.EnterExit or in other words locks.

Negative 35275 pSo my question revolves around the use of Spring AOP with XML based schema versus using it with AspectJ. From looking around online Ive been trying to figure out which approach to take for AOP. One particular scenario has me slightly confusedp  pSuppose I have a number of classes with n number of methods, and I want to apply advice from my aspect class to certain methodsjoin points but not all, I can see when using AspectJ that this would be fairly straightforward  I just apply my aspect annotation to the methods that should use the advice. However, from what Ive seen of the xml based approach, I would have to create a pointcut for each of these methods assuming they cant be covered by one expression i.e. each method has a distinct name and if I was using the proxy based approach a proxy class for each targetclass. The AspectJ approach seems much tidier in this sense.p  pSo is my understanding of the two methods correct or have I missed out on some part of Spring AOP that can achieve a neater solution for the xml approach p  pSorry for the longwinded explanation, but I wanted to make the scenario as clear as possible...p

This editor will basically loadsave a serialized file, which is then used by the game to do whatever it desires.p  pI see this serialized file pretty much as a database, as it contains data thats constantly used by multiple views, possibly at the same time. As a result of that thought I figured to have all this data lists of objects, strings, integers, whatever in a centralized location which all views can read, update, add to, etcetera.p  pMy first thought would go to a singleton class which has a reference to the deserialized data, then databind that accordingly so all open views recieve a notification when something changes at any time.p  pBut I was wondering, is there a way WPF would like you to solve this rather than directly binding to a singleton, static data, or a proxy property property in a datacontext which just returns the data from the singleton Or is this just the way to gop

Negative 35275 pI have a jQuery plugin named codeshowLoadingcode which shows AJAX loading indicators on top of desired Elements.  It can be ran multiple times at once on different parts of the screen.  It also allows you to pass in a codebeforeShowcode Callback Function and a codeafterShowcode Callback Function.p  pBelow is an example of how I am trying to plugin to it and show an addition Fixed DIV across the top of the screen to show when my AJAX scripts are processing as sometimes these targeted elements that show the loading indicators are hidden out of view on the screen.p  pMy callback function works and inserts a new DIV at the top of the screen when this other script triggers it, however the problem seems to be since it can be called multiple times within less than a second and with different ones ending at different times, it seems that the codeafterShowcode callback function ends up getting called before you can even see the loading DIV I am adding to the top of the screenp  pMy question, is there anyway to somehow make my DIV get inserted into the page the first time the codebeforeShowcode is fired and then somehow prevent it from being removed as soon as codeafterShowcode is called...the catch is, it does need to eventually be removed from screen.  Im not sure there is a 100 good way to achieve this even.  p  pOne method in mind is to use some sort of timer but that would almost seem useless as it would then be so inaccurate on a fast processing vs long processing action.p  pI can try to set up a demo but I am curious if this is even really possible and what the options arep  precode 3rd party jQuery script that shows AJAX loading indicators all over the screen and is called multiple times on some pages for different areas of the screen.

Negative 35275 pIn my test I cannot get the Galleria of PrimeFaces running properly, even if I copy exactly the example mentioned on the a hrefhttpwww.primefaces.orgshowcaseuimultimediagalleria.xhtml relnofollowPrimeFaces Showcase Sitea. In my example I have 4 JPG images each of size 500x313. When I load the page through the browser, the Galleria appears and shows all the pictures as mini icons on the bottom part of the Galleria. But the picture shown in big is only the first one. By default it is set to automatically run through the pictures using an effect. In my case it has to run through all pictures once. After that it restarts at the beginning and then all the pictures are shown as expected. But the first walkthrough all pictures only shows the first picture.

Address BusinessAdd  codepre  pnow this 2 models are sharing one common model,p  precodeClass Address          String Street         String zip         ...  codepre  pNow when I save business or person, it still shows that Address.list.size  0 in unittesting. When I explicitly save the object as,p  precodeaddress.saveflush true new Business... ... ..., address address.saveflushtrue codepre  pit works fine,  but then when I delete it doesnt get deleted either. I tried cascade alldeleteorphan and delete, didnt work, I also tried,p  precodeClass Business         ....       def beforeDelete             Address.withNewSession              Address.loadaddress.id.delete                      .....  codepre  pBut still no expected output What should i do to solve this problemp

Negative 35275 pI want to implement a clientside file decryption in the browser. It takes decrypted files from a server and should decrypt it in the browser, presenting a emSave Asem dialog to save the decrypted file. It should also work for large files 1 GB or more.p  pI have the following strategy in mindp  ul liDownload the file using codeXMLHttpRequestcode with coderesponseType  blobcode.li liDecrypt by transforming the Blob given by codeXMLHttpRequestcode.li liProvide the decrypted Blob as a codeobjectURLcode to the user.li ul  pThe decryption could work like a stream transformation, it reads chunks from the downloaded Blob, decrypts the data and writes into the output Blob.p  pHowever as far as I can tell this will only work with current browsers if you can load the whole file into memory you need to store the complete decrypted blob in memory before you can create an codeobjectURLcode. It seems that no kind of chunked readingwriting is supported by the current codeBlobcode, codeXMLHttpRequestcode and codecreateObjectURLcode interface as described on the a hrefhttpsdeveloper.mozilla.orgenUSdocsWebAPIBlob relnofollowMozilla Developer Networka. A Blob is immutable and there doesnt seem to be an streaming support for binary data in browsers.p  pIs there any way to implement this with current browsersp

Negative 35275 pThis is my first post on SO. I havent already developed much code for embedded systems, but I have few problems and need help from more advanced programmers. I use following devices  LandTiger board with LPC1768 Cortex M3 MCU,  Digilent pmodACL with ADXL345 accelerometer 3 axis,  Digilent  pmodGYRO with L3G4200D gyroscope 3 axis.p  pI would like to get some information about device orientation, i.e. rotation angles over X, Y and Z axes. Ive read that in order to achieve this I need to combine data from both accelerometer and gyroscope using Kallman filter or its simpler form i.e. complementary filter. I would like to know if its possible to count roll, pitch and yaw from full range 0360 degrees using measurment data only from gyroscope and accelerometer without magnetometer. Ive also found some mathematical formulas a hrefhttpwww.ewerksinc.comrefdocsTilt20Sensing20with20LA.pdf relnofollowhttpwww.ewerksinc.comrefdocsTilt20Sensing20with20LA.pdfa and a hrefhttpwww.freescale.comfilessensorsdocappnoteAN3461.pdf relnofollowhttpwww.freescale.comfilessensorsdocappnoteAN3461.pdfa but they contain root squares in numeratorsdenominators so the information about proper quadrant of coordinate system is lost.p

Negative 35275 pI got this homework where I have to extract a licence plate from pictures of cars. I dont have to identify the plate numbers and lettersthat is a colleagues job.

Negative 35275 pIm required to deliver thousands of emailed reports each day to support business operations. Currently I use SQL Server Reporting Services to implement this. Though SSRS is very stable and reliable, it also seems to be slow for my particular use case, taking 30 minutes to complete some of the data driven subscriptions. p  pData driven subscriptions offers us the opportunity to store a TSQL query within the report server that selects the email addresses we want to send to along with the parameters we want to feed into the report and set that to run on a schedule. This is useful because it allows us to select the division, currency, and other parameters that personalize the report in the best way for the recipient. However, even a report with a few parameters, there are a finite, small number of permutations. For example, for one report that we use to send 10k emails each day, there are only 12 permutations sent daily. What I would really like is to preload a cache with those 12 permutations. p  pSSRS allows you to cache a report. I turned this on and left the default 30 minutes in and it seemed to have zero effect when run with a data driven subscription. In other words, I ran the subscription, which send about 950 emails with caching off and then with caching on and the run time for the subscription was identical  it had no impact. p  pIve also attempted to use snapshots, which sounds like it would be perfect. Unfortunately, snapshots only work with default parameter values. It seems like there is no way to store snapshots with each permutation of possible parameter values  THIS IS WHAT I THINK I WANT. Emailing thousands of reports from the already assembled snapshots should speed things up quite a lot. p  pHas anyone found any workaround for this p
Negative 35275 pI have a table for inputting data and running calculations. This table has a lot of columns, so I create a second table for a printable output. The first column  in both tables is a unique value that is common to both tables, so the output table is basically a table that uses lookup functions to pull the required data or results out of the input table for each row. p  pWhat is the best way to make the first column in both tables always be identical as the end user adds and deletes rows from the input table Ive been trying to work out a macro so that every time a value is added to the first column of the input the value is copied to the last row of the first column of the output table, but then I dont know how it would work if a row was deleted, or if a duplicate value was added. Or I could use a macro that would copy and paste the entire column every time the input column was changed. Are there any obvious solutions I am missing that I should also be considering I am pretty new to VBA, but once I figure out which direction would make things easiest for the end user I think I will be able to figure it out.p  pUpdate For anyone else with a similar problem this is the code I ended up writing, it works great so far.

I have it like this right nowp  precodeclass Item1   include MongoidDocument    embedsone detail1, classname gt Detail    field n end  class Item2   include MongoidDocument    embedsone detail2, classname gt Detail    field n end codepre  pBut, in order to retrieve the detail subdocument, I would like to have something likep  precodeclass Item1   include MongoidDocument    embedsone detail, as detail1, classname gt Detail    field n end  class Item2   include MongoidDocument    embedsone detail, as detail2, classname gt Detail    field n end codepre  pThis doesnt do what I expect. Is there a way to achieve what I want or changing Detail documents to have different names in each collection is the only solution               p  pThanks.p
Negative 35275 pI have a hard time finding information on how I would go about developing a keyboard layout that uses IME without it just being information on how I can simply add a new keyboard layout that uses the microsoft IME or how I can use the Microsoft IME in my applications.p  pWhat I want to do is making the whole thing from scratch. Its not supposed to be for an existing language so its not like any of the existing IMEs would be an alternative but, obviously, having information on how Id go about developing an IME for Japanese, Chinese or Korean is also a nice thing.p  pGoogle has their own IME that is cross platform so I assume that it is possible to do it but I just cant find any information on it.p  pThanksp  pThe OS is Windows 8.1, by the way.p

Negative 35275 pI wrote a PHP program that performs a rawlist function on a remote server with many about 1000 directories.

On the other hand, the plain old FTP rawlist function ftprawlist returns the same results in about 30 seconds.p  pI understand that an SSH connection adds overhead because of encryption, but this seems excessive.

Negative 35275 pthis is the first time Ive posted to Stackflow and am relatively new to HTMLCSS so please keep that in mind when answering. Here is my issue, I have created a 3 div column 100 width with the first column being split in two , the middle column being one, and the last column also being split into two. I have gotten it to a point where they all line up when my browser screen is about 6070 of the screen but when I make it the full screen the 3 divs start to overlap the area below it.p  pIve been banging my head against this and have ready countless blogs and forums about making divs equal height but none seem to be working assuming user error.

Negative 35275 pSaludos.p  pI want to sums even index of a list, and i do it works normally with every list, BUT when if the passed list like argument have a duplicated item, the code dont work like it should.p  pexample, I have this codep  precodedef sumarindicesparesarray              sums evenindexes elements           suma  []     while array  []         return 0     for i in array         if array.indexi  2  0              suma.appendi     return sumsuma codepre  pif i pass like argument the nextp  precode   sumarindicespares[1,2,3,4,5]     give 9 and this is ok codepre  pBut, when i put like argument a list with duplicated items, the loop for iterate and when its over index [1] like is not even Par in spanish obviously dont sums that index but when the loop reach a even index but with the same value of previous index the code dont sums the even index, examplep  precodesumarindicespares[1,2,3,4,2]    it gives 4 and should be 6 because 132  6  codepre  pso, the first index with value of 2 is not even so  dont sums that index, but should sums the next index with value of 2 because is a even index.p  pNote argument list empty will return 0, that part is ok .p  pAny Solution Thanks.p

Negative 35275 pIm looking to build an Android application that makes use of a mapping API to display satellite maps offline.brbr Obviously I cant store the whole map of the world because its too much data to store, so my idea is to be able to put satellite maps of different countries onto different SD cards and then the users selects the SD card with the map of the country they would like and puts it in the phone where the map will then be displayed in my app.brPreferably Id like to avoid using Google maps.br br So my question is what APIs for Android are out there that would allow me to build an application that can show satellite view maps that can be stored on an SD card for offline usebr brthanksp
Negative 35275 pI have written a small Java Program that uses BouncyCastle to create public and private RSA keys which it then uses to encryptdecrypt files. I am able to encrypt and decrypt files using the Java program. I am also able to decrypt an encrypted file using OpenSSL with the keys generated by the program. p  pThe problem is that OpenSSL cannot load the public key to generated by my Java program to encrypt data.p  pI am going to share the public and private keys I created as a test.

The problem is I want the submit button to check if the entry has already been made by checking 2 textboxes Textbox1 amp Textbox2 with the columns in sheet Column A amp D. If both the textboxes enry matches with the existing data then it should replace the row after giving a message else add it to next empty row. I used one code I got from some forum but it didnot work for me nor does it gives an option of replacing existing row with same data and I dont know how to modify it..p  pThere is one more thing I want the xperts help with that is I want to check the date entered in textbox2 if its previous then give error message Basically it should not allow entry in previous date.

Negative 35275 pIm converting a series of csh scripts to bash as they need to work on two different systems. Currently the scripts work on one system but not the other properly. The conversion to bash is required so they will work on both. In addition, there are some specific coding required for the scripts to work on one system this doesnt affect how it runs on the other.p  pSo far all the converted scripts work fine, but Ive now got a script which has a goto function in it. Since bash doesnt have a goto equivalent, Ive been trying to find a solution that works.p  pThe script has a number of start and end options which are pulled from a separate config file. These then allow the script to start and stop at different points. For examplep  pstart POINTAPOINTBbr end POINTBPOINTCp  pThis means that the script could start at POINTA or B, but POINT A can end at B or C, or POINTB can only end at C. The script has more points than this, but this should explain what the script needs to do.p  pI found a function that appears to work, but has eval in it and apparently this is a bad code and shouldnt be used. It also appears to conflict with some  if statements ie. the coding is ignored and an error occurs.

Negative 35275 pMy questions is mostly about testing methodology.  I am working for an organization which practices TDD Test Driven Development. We are using AngularJS and hence its full testing stack  Jasmine for unit tests and Protractor for e2e testing.p  pWhen developing a feature our process begins by first writing a failing e2e tests and then writing the feature our using TDD. The tests are only written for public methods be it for controllerdirectivesservices. The product it self does not contain any complex logic besides couple of exceptions. Recently we began  discussing the fact that there is no point in writing unit tests for controllers, as they are exposing functionality, 100 of it is exposed to the view and it tested using e2e tests anyway. Basically  unit tests and e2e tests are overlapping. At first we all agreed, but then this decision opened a Pandora box. After all, the same thing could be said about directives. So why test them aswell  Then the question of services came up. Most of them 98 simply make a backend call and return the response. So why not simply mock httpBackend and test the services while testing the controllers, which are tested through e2e.p  pYou get the drift....p  pI do see benefit in doing both unit tests and e2e tests, despite them practically overlapping. Mainly  instant feedback and executable documentation. What are you practicing Do you see other benefits and is juice worth the squeeze  is it worth writing overlapping tests for the simplest of implementations just to get those two benefits abovep

Negative 35275 pIm pushing myself to make use of functions more often and have hit a wall with what is going on with my function return.p  pThis code used here is pulled out of a much larger area of code to make it easier to work with here, so treat it more like test code then something that is going to do anything that makes sense.  All this test code performs the same as my full code and replicates my problem.p  pAt the end of the code I have sample information being used for this illustration.  The code is building a dynamic form.p  pfunction formInputTypeSelector uses the variable built with doorFinish . finish[series] to identify the array to pass as part of the variables when the function is called.  So in this case, that is doorFinishTrack[140].p  pThat function then calls the appropriate input type function identified function radioInputs in this test code and returns the form for that input type.p  pThe functions are all working fine.  The problem I am having is that if I echo my function return echo inputForm, my form ends up out of the document flow and not inside the divs I want it in.  I know that I should use strongreturnstrong return inputForm to fix this, but when I do my form no longer contains the function output. p  pIve tried everything I can think of and searched online for several hours now. I understand I probably have an issue here with serverside scripting versus the local HTML and the timing of this and what is called first.p  pMy question is, how can I properly return the output from function radioInputs into the dynamically built form and keep it in the document flowp  precodeltphp      category         4.0  Track     doorFinishTrack  array         140 gt arrayAluminum gt 1, Dark Bronze gt 1, Clear gt 0, Gold gt 0, Curvable gt 0, Recessed Track Channel gt 1         ,         220 gt arrayAluminum gt 1, Dark Bronze gt 1, Clear gt 1, Gold gt 0, Curvable gt 0, Recessed Track Channel gt 1         ,         240 gt arrayAluminum gt 1, Dark Bronze gt 1, Clear gt 1, Gold gt 0, Curvable gt 1, Recessed Track Channel gt 1         ,         440 gt arrayAluminum gt 1, Dark Bronze gt 1, Clear gt 1, Gold gt 0, Curvable gt 1, Recessed Track Channel gt 1         ,         540 gt arrayAluminum gt 1, Dark Bronze gt 1, Clear gt 1, Gold gt 0, Curvable gt 1, Recessed Track Channel gt 1         ,         640 gt arrayAluminum gt 1, Dark Bronze gt 0, Clear gt 1, Gold gt 0, Curvable gt 1, Recessed Track Channel gt 1         ,         740 gt arrayAluminum gt 1, Dark Bronze gt 0, Clear gt 1, Gold gt 0, Curvable gt 1, Recessed Track Channel gt 1         ,         2100 gt arrayAluminum gt 1, Dark Bronze gt 1, Clear gt 1, Gold gt 0, Curvable gt 0, Recessed Track Channel gt 0         ,         3300 gt arrayAluminum gt 1, Dark Bronze gt 0, Clear gt 1, Gold gt 0, Curvable gt 0, Recessed Track Channel gt 0, Heavy Duty Aluminum Ceiling Guard with Seperate Track gt 1                    parse the call and pas on the specific input type function     function formInputTypeSelector inputArray, series, finish, inputType, arg1, arg2               Call input type function             foreach inputArray as key gt value                  inputName  finish . key                 inputLabel  key                 inputFunction  inputType .

Negative 35275 pI have been quickly coding a simple QDialog with a QVBoxLayout with the functionality to enable an Arduino project of mine and I really want to update a QPushButton I have placed to make it go from start to stop and back every time.

Unfortunately, I was not able to provide a minimal example that showcases the problem.p  pIn this question, I am making an attempt to redefine the problem and provide a minimal example. The code presented in the example below executes and does what it is supposed to do. However, in a slightly more complex case presented in the previous a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions30406711cinitializinguniqueptrwithnullornullptrquestiona, sometimes, it results in the runtime error p  precodedynamiclinks3941,0x7fff749a2310 malloc  error for object 0x61636f6c65720054 pointer being freed was not allocated  set a breakpoint in mallocerrorbreak to debug codepre  pUnfortunately, I was only able to produce the error when the optimisation is set to codeO3code and, possibly, codeO2code. This creates a problem when using debugging tools. Unfortunately, I was not able to reproduce the problem with nominimal code optimisation. For a reference, I am using codegcc 4.9.1code.p  pIn the present question, I would like to understand if the structural design of the class inheritance mechanism that I am using could, potentially, be dangerous from the perspective of the dynamic memory allocation.

Negative 35275 pI am trying to run a binary logistic regression in R on a very large set of data. I keep running into memory problems. I have tried many different packages to try to circumvent this issue, but am still stuck. I thought packages such as caret and biglm would help. But they gave me the same memory error. Why is it that when I start with a dataset with 300,000 rows and 300 columns and proceed to subset it to 50,000 rows and 120 columns, it still requires the same amount of memory It makes no sense. I have no way of replicating the data since it is sensitive information, but most of the variables are factors. Below are some examples I have triedp  blockquote   pmodel  bigglmf, data  reg, na.action  na.pass, family  binomiallinklogit, chunksize  5000br   Error cannot allocate vector of size 128.7 Gbp      pMyControl lt trainControlmethod  repeatedCV, index  MyFolds, summaryFunction  twoClassSummary, classProbs  TRUEbr   fit  trainf, data  reg, family  binomial, trControl  MyControlp blockquote
Negative 35275 pI am looking to pass an array of object from activity to activity in Android. I understand that the optimal way to do this is having your passed objects implement codeParcelablecode or codeSerializablecode, as explained a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions2736389howtopassobjectfromoneactivitytoanotherinandroidherea. p  pHowever, if I am passing an emarrayem of these objects, will this still work, considering you are now passing an array of objects that implement those interfaces, rather than the object itself If not, would I instead need to extend a class such as codeArrayListcode and implement these interfaces, and pass that array object insteadp

Negative 35275 pSay we have a form with a lot of elements.p  pId like a way through generic code, to be able to add listeners to these elements so that for example, all the elements with a builtin codefocuscode event, like text inputs or dropdowns, will have this codeonFocuscode listener.

Negative 35275 pWhen a function takes a series of values as a parameter, is it considered good style to accept an codeIteratorltTgtcode instead of codeVecltTgtcode  p  pThis way, the caller can decide on their own how the series is stored inside a codeVeccode, a code[T N]code or anything else, actually an codeOptionltTgtcode should be possible. Also, this eliminates the need to convert the whatever you have into a codeVeccode, and also, after applying some Iterator modifiers, no code.collectcode is needed So it should also be fasterp  pAm I missing something or is this the way it should be donep

Negative 35275 pI have a set of CSV files with duplicate data, i.e. the same row might and does appear in multiple files.

Negative 35275 pSo I have created a UITableView with two sections. The first section has one row and no header. The row is an image, and when selected, a photo browser view is pushed to the navigation stack. p  pThe second section has a custom header view with rows containing details on the image. p  pThe problem I have is that when I scroll the tableview to the bottom, the image in section 0, row 0 is not selectable, didSelectRowAtIndexPath doesnt get called. If I first load the view, the image is selectable. Any ideas p  precodepragma UITableViewDelegate  CGFloattableViewUITableView tableView heightForRowAtIndexPathNSIndexPath indexPath     CGFloat returnValue     float height

Negative 35275 pPlease consider the following situation.  As you know before Main executes CLR allocates an inner data structure for every referenced type inside Main, which contains an entry for each method defined in the referenced type. Subsequently each entry holds reference stub to the block of memory where respective native code is stored. Lets suppose while executing code inside Main JITter encounters a method strongSomeClass1.M1strong. SomeClass1 is referenced to find related IL code.br So herere the questions br what happens when CLR bumps into another method call inside M1, lets say strongSomeClass2.M2strong. Does it mean the second data structure containing methods of SomeClass2 is created and the address of the native code will then be bound to the corresponding method If yes, then br  what will be stored inside the first data structurebr  what will be stored inside the first data structure if M1s description immediately starts with calling M2 and theres also some code inside M1 that follows M2.p  pUnfortunately all Ive found on the web was a description saying that methods IL code is just compiled into native code and then gets executed.p  pSo if my assumptions are not correct, please offer your opinion.  brThank youp

If adding table headers does not make sense, then maybe the table should not be used to show these data and it should just be codetextcode.
