For example, if you spend 50, you will get a coupon worth eight percent of that amount. The following table shows the percent used to calculate the coupon awarded for different amounts spent.

Positive 555 pSince I am relatively new to R and I would like to use it for formatting large amount of data that are in one file 30,000 unique IDs and rewriting them in different format in another file. I have a big problem in solving some sort of Rbehaviour. Due to the complexity of the case I share a dropbox folder with the example files included. This is what I am trying to achievep  pI would like to have the file formatted like the Final Product.dat which is space delimited but it has to keep rigorously the same spacing as here, otherwise the things I am running will not run.  So, on the first line of the file there is an ID called HUXXX...1 which will go from 1 to 30,000, then the next 5 lines will be always the same and then there are the data. So, the lines from 2 to 4 are written in a separate file SHead and for the whole the line 5 I wrote in header.txt  For the first line, I created another file called IDs100 which will contain the HUXXXX plus the ID column. I was hopin to use some sort of sprintf in that case see code attached in dropbox.  the data are in the S100.txt note that I have created an ID as first column.p  pMy code kind of work but within each ID will repeat the same values for the whole ID. For example, for ID 1 instead of creating one HU0000001 and one profile as in Final Product.dat it will create 12 times HU00001 and the same data, then do the same for ID 2.

Because that is not possible read from javascript. But google docs dont use contenteditable or input and still they can do it.

Positive 555 pIm receiving a file that is exported to Excel via SQL Server. The cells in the file have the green error checking notification and all cells on the sheet appear to be formatted as GENERAL. However the error checking notification says that the cells are formatted as TEXT or have a leading apostrophe but when you actually click inside the cell to edit there is no leading apostrophe and technically the sheet is formatted as GENERAL. p  pIf I manually highlight my range and click on the error checking dropdown options to fix the problem and select convert to number, my code runs perfectly. I tried recording a macro to see the code that would be written for the error checking conversion to number format but it didnt record anything while it converted to number. p  pIs there VBA code that uses the error checking convert to number function instead of doing it manually by selecting that option through the dropdown p

Positive 555 pstrongPreamblestrongp  pRecently Ive been struggling with big excel spreadsheets that have a lot of text and comments multiple people work on single document. It is tremendously hard to  edit it again and again considering new notes, since document navigating becomes pretty complicated at some point. So, I decided that I need some tool to getset only the data I actually need at one moment single cell content, corresponsive comment content, additional data for the cells row on demand.p  pstrongWhat is done so farstrongp  pFortunatelly the start was pretty easy. I filled UserForm with 4 textboxes 2 readonly, 2 for editing, that are filled with data of the selected comment by index, and some buttons that allow to acceptdiscard changes and navigate between commented cells.p  pstrongQuestions itselfstrongp  pFirst of all, I need to keep text formatting when I take the text from cell. Currently I am not taking any formatting, just text. All I found by googling is that I can set formatting character by character, sort of like in the following pseudocodep  precodeFor i  0 to CellsRow, Col.Text.Length     MyTextBox.Texti.FormatOption1  CellsRow, Col.Texti.FormatOption1     ...     MyTextBox.Texti.FormatOptionN  CellsRow, Col.Texti.FormatOptionN Next codepre  pBut this approach feels to be stupid. So, question one isp  pemIs there a way to copy full text formatting Font, BIU, color, Size for each letter in the cell alongside with text, from cell to TextBox and backwards, with one line of codeemp  pSecond of all I actually need some formatting tools in the UserForm to do aforesaid text formatting in my form, so question two isp  pemIs there a way to add formatting tools the ones that are located in HomeFont menu, or popup menu when you select some text in a cell into UserForm to edit text in TextBox objectemp  pP.S. using Excel 2013p  pA bit of addition I somehow assume that if there is no direct way to do what Ive described in questions  there has to be some custommade toolbox object sort of EvenRicherTextBox that was created by someone before. I just cannot believe that issue never came up, but I have no idea what keywords I need to use in order to find that object.p

Anyone who has a mac may see the behavior I want if they change their wallpaper every X minutes.  p  pMy current thoughts on how I would approach this is to take both images and lay one over the other and vary the opacity.  Start the old image at 90 and the new image at 10.  I would then decrease the old image by 10 until it is 0, while increasing the new image by 10 until 90.

Negative 555 pSorry if the title is a little cryptic. Basically Im creating a zoom control in a c forms app, the idea is that I can zoom an image by factors, ie. 1x, 2x, 4x, 8x. I need the image to remain pixelated, ie. nearest neighbors. The zooming works wonderfully except that when I select Interp mode to be nearest neighbors when working with the boundary pixels it defaults to the inner color. This is to say that the outer pixels appear to have half the width as the inner pixels, where the issue really comes in is when I add a tooltip to display the x,y coordinates of the current mousedover pixel it is thrown off. To be clear, the reason it is thrown off is because I calculate the current pixel asp  precodevoid mpictureBoxMouseMoveobject sender, MouseEventArgs e      int x  e.Location.X  mzoomFactor     int y  e.Location.Y  mzoomFactor  codepre  pand since the outer pixel are half the width... well you get the picture.p  pThe drawing code is simplyp  precodevoid mpictureBoxPaintobject sender, PaintEventArgs e      if mpictureBox.Imagenull              e.Graphics.InterpolationMode  System.Drawing.Drawing2D.InterpolationMode.NearestNeighbor         e.Graphics.ScaleTransformfloatmzoomFactor, floatmzoomFactor         e.Graphics.DrawImagempictureBox.Image, 0, 0                   codepre  pThe picture control is hosted within my custom ZoomControl which is itself inherited from the Panel control. p  pMy question is basically, can any body help me resolve the boundary pixel issue and is there a better way to get zoom functionalityp

Negative 555 pSQL Server 2008 database design problem. p  pIm defining the architecture for a service where site users would manage a large volume of data on multiple websites that they own 100MB average, 1GB maximum per site. I am considering whether to split the databases up such that the core site management tables users, payments, contact details, login details, products etc are held in one database, and the database relating to the customers own websites is held in a separate database.p  pI am seeing a possible gain in that I can distribute the hardware architecture to provide more meat to the heavy lifting done in the websites database leaving the site management database in a more appropriate area. But Im also conscious of losing the ability to directly relate the sites to the customers through a Foreign key as far as I know this cant be done cross database. p  pSo, the question is two fold  in general terms should data in this sort of scenario be split out into multiple databases, or should it all be held in a single databasep  pIf it is split into multiple, is there a recommended way to protect the integrity and security of the system at the database layer to ensure that there is a strong relationship between the twop  pThanks for your help.p

Negative 555 pthis is my first time posting so please excuse any lapses in stackoverflow etiquette.p  pI havent found any example code or any questions that address the problem Im having, so hopefully someone can shed some light on this.  p  pIm using Quartz and I have a CATiledLayer on which I have drawn several boxes you can click on.  When you click one, I want to redraw that box with a blue outline, but not redraw the rest of the view.  From the comments I have read it seems like I should be using setNeedsDisplayInRect instead of setNeedsDisplay once I have clicked inside the bounds of one of the boxes, and set the dirty rect to the size of that box.  However, whenever my voiddrawRectCGRectrect function is called, the rect in voiddrawRectCGRectrect is always the size of my view, no matter what rect I tried to invalidate in setNeedsDisplayInRect.  I dont think I am calling setNeedsDisplay or setNeedsDisplayInRect anywhere else, but for some reason the entire view is invalidated.  If I dont use a CATiledLayer, this problem doesnt appear and DrawRect receives the correct rect when setNeedsDisplayInRect is called.p  pHere is a simplified version of my codep  precodeimport ltQuartzCoreQuartzCore.hgt import ltOpenGLESEAGLDrawable.hgt  import EAGLView.h import MapViewController.h    A class extension to declare private methods interface EAGLView   property nonatomic, retain EAGLContext context  end  implementation EAGLView  ClasslayerClass      return [CATiledLayer class]    idinitWithFrameCGRectframe      self.frame.size.width is 920     self.frame.size.height is 790     if self  [super initWithFrameframe]          self.backgroundColor  [UIColor whiteColor]          CGColorSpaceRef colorSpace  CGColorSpaceCreateDeviceRGB         myContext  CGBitmapContextCreateNULL, self.frame.size.width, self.frame.size.height, 8, 4self.frame.size.width, colorSpace, kCGImageAlphaPremultipliedFirst         CGColorSpaceReleasecolorSpace          myLayer  CGLayerCreateWithContextmyContext, self.frame.size, NULL          CATiledLayer animLayer  CATiledLayer  self.layer         animLayer.levelsOfDetailBias  2         animLayer.tileSize  CGSizeMake1000,1000            return self         voiddrawRectCGRectrect       Drawing code, rect is always equal to the size of the view 920,720     voidtouchesBeganNSSet touches withEventUIEvent event       testRect  CGRectMake0, 0, 100.0, 100.0     [self setNeedsDisplayInRecttestRect]    voiddealloc       [super dealloc]   end codepre  pHas anyone else run into a problem like this  Is this a limitation of CATiledLayer or am I just using it incorrectly  By the way, the reason I am using the CATiledLayer is solely so that I can maintain sharp graphics as I zoom in and out on a UIScrollView.  The CATiledLayer is embedded in a UIScrollView, but removing the CATiledLayer from the UIScrollView does not fix this problem.  If anyone can suggest a better alternative to get the vectorized graphics effect on zoom, please let me know.

Negative 555 pfollowing the discussion at a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions1825621howdoyouuseaioandepolltogetherinasingleeventloophttpstackoverflow.comquestions1825621howdoyouuseaioandepolltogetherinasingleeventloopa.p  pThere are in fact 2 aio APIs in linux. Theres POSIX aio the aio family of functions, included in glibc  and libaio developed I believe by RedHat , the io family.p  pThe first one allows registration of notification requests via aiosigevent aiocb member. That can be easily integrated with ppollpselect event loops. If you want to integrate POSIX aio with epoll then you need to translate the signal into an event on a dummy fd a pipe maybe and listen for it with epoll, while catching the signal either in a classic manner or with ppollselect. How safe is the first choice normal sighandlers, depends on application. And maybe on epoll but im not fully aware of its internals. May I safely assume that if I have an epoll based app and I want to add POSIX aio support then Im screwed This was my question.p  pThe second AIO implementation, libaio  can be used indeed with eventfd struct iocb having an aioresfd member that is expected to be zero or an eventfd to deliver AIO results to. But its not by the book. POSIXspecified, that is.p  pI dream of myself being a BSD user where everything is clear. You have the POSIX AIO and kqueue support for AIO events. Crystal clear. Like many other things.p

Negative 555 pI am upgrading my Rails plugin to be an engine that works with the latest 3.0RC1 release and Im having a bit of trouble figuring out the best and most correct way to extend codeActionControllercode.

I have tried naming my controller something other than codeApplicationControllercode and having the real codeApplicationControllercode extend it, but that doesnt seem to work either. Im really up for any solution that makes the life of the engine user as easy as possible. Ideally, they wouldnt have to extend my class, but theyd have all of the functionality built into their own codeApplicationControllercode.p

Negative 555 pIs there a good algorithm for this after an amount of searching around I havent been able to find any conclusive answers.p  pBasically in a system which collects various bits of data about its users, each user is identified by a 64 bit unique Id. this Id is used as a primary key to a data set which may include any amount of data collected from this user. as is, this works fine as the Ids are already unique, but for legal reasons I need to hash the Ids in a way that I cannot link them back to the actual person. but at the same time needing to guarantee the uniqueness of the ID.p  pObviously with the values being unique it would be possible to reverse engineer the algorithm used. but Im not so sure that it being 100 unbreakable is so much of an issue here rather than making it so there isnt an easy way of reversing itp  pthanksp

The simplified concept is that each player build can several different units and buildings to improve their base and fight other players for points. p  pMy question involves the designing of the Django models, it seems to me that the buildings and units, which will have different attack power, life and such, should be their own models like so p  precodeclass Unitdb.Model     name  db.StringProperty     type  db.ReferencePropertyUnitType     targets  KeyListPropertyUnitType     attack  db.IntegerProperty     life  db.IntegerProperty     price  db.IntegerProperty codepre  pMy problem then comes to how to easiest be able to set the players amount of a specific unitbuilding. As an example a player should be able to purchase, say 15 airplanes. p  pI then could just set airplane as an IntegerProperty in the player model and use the unit name as an identifier when getting the attack power and life of the airplane. That would however not be a very dynamic design, since the player model does not know if the unit airplane is actually present yet. I would like the player model to mirror the existing UnitBuildingmodels in someway.p  pThis is my first try on a webbased game so I might be totally off track, does anyone have input on this Is there a better way to do itp

Negative 555 pI have a class that proccesses n number of http requests  repsonses asynchronously and recursively. I was pretty happy with my class until I realised that I may have coded myself into a bit of a hole. Essentially I would like to raise an event after each response is read to comfirm if the application has proceeded to the next or finished early for whatever reason. I will admit I am really new to asynchronous programming so I am using the Async Enumerator class to help me out.

I am doing this recursively as each new request depends on the response gotten from the previous request. This functionality works currently.p  pThe issue I am having is, as the responses are coming back asynchronously I have no way of getting back to the UI thread to let the UI know how far along I am. If any of the response fails the collection of requests fails as a whole so it would be nice to know which request failed as well as why.p  pI would also like to have another async operation working that can take in this data and display it with an indeterminate progress bar. That way the user is getting real time data from the UI as to how far along the operation is and if it failed why. I tried a backround worker here but because the first request is asyncrhonous and DOWORK is a synchronous method the WORKCompleted event of a backround worker is called before the work is actually finished.p  pAs for the AsyncEnumerator. It essentially uses an enumerator to specify what to do after yield It calls move next when HttpEndGetResponse is ready. This eleviates some of the issues in that I can marshal an event back to the UI thread to talk to the progress worker but it is still messy so I have not yet implemented it.p  pWhat I would like to do is fire off a SEND method on a SENDER object, then fire off a SHOWPROGRESS method on a different async call using a PROGRESSDISPLAY object. As each iteration of the Send method yields send data back to the UI which sends it off the PROGRESSDISPLAY object and allow it to update until the final call which would tell PROGRESSDISPLAY to close.p

Negative 555 pI am using the android emulator ddms to simulate movement using a gpx file.  There are about 1000 entries in the gpx file.

My code is as follows...p  precodeLocationManager locationManager  LocationManager    this.getSystemServiceContext.LOCATIONSERVICE           locationManager.requestLocationUpdatesLocationManager.GPSPROVIDER, 1000, 1, myListener  myListener  new LocationListener public void onLocationChangedLocation location     double mylat  location.getLatitude     double mylon  location.getLongitude       ...      ...  codepre  pMy understanding of the requestLocationUpdates being set to 1000 is that it should request a location update every 1 second provided the location is more than 1m away from the previous.  Is this correct  If so, why would I only be retrieving a few of the latlon pairs from the gpx file  Wouldnt I be retrieving nearly a thousand  The GPS data is from someone running so there is constant motion.p

Negative 555 pI have recently upgraded my .Net 3.5 solution containing some C code projects and a ASP.net web site project to VS2010 from VS2008. It is building and running fine inside VS, but I get some problems when trying to build it on my server with MSBuild 4.0 via TeamCity. It seems like the projects that are referenced from the web site are not built. This was all working fine before I upgraded to VS2010, MSbuild 4.0 and Windows SDK 7.1.p  pInside the msbuild script that I use to build from teamcity I have defined project references for the web site like thisp  precode  ltProjectReference Include..srctrunkDataAccessDataAccess.csprojgt      ltProjectgtC43242F472864BEC9A27001D6FC14860ltProjectgt      ltNamegtDataAccessltNamegt   ltProjectReferencegt codepre  pWhen I try to run the build script I get an error message saying that it could not find the dll file when trying to copy it from the bin folder of the referenced project into the bin folder of the web site. This is happening because the referenced projects are in fact never built at all No bin folder exists in the project dir.p  pDoes anyone have a clue what may cause this I am not very experienced with MSbuild, so I may have overlooked some important stuff. Is it not so that MSbuild will automatically try to build the referenced projects if no project output is existingp  pWill be thankful for any helpp

Negative 555 pedit Ok, to put this in a question, Im asking for possible ways I should be organizing this into classes and which data structures I should use to store the information from transactions. Currently, I have this httpdl.dropbox.comu9210234classes.jpg  not even close to what I want, its just what Im working on. And its currently storing the report data in dictionary objects as strings. I need to be able to easily extract this information, find transactions by searching on fields and things like that, and Im pretty sure the way Im currently going at it isnt going to make that easy.p  pI want to make an easy to use c library for using the Payflow reporting API. There is a full guide available a hrefhttpscms.paypal.comcmscontentUSenUSfilesdeveloperPPReportingGuide.pdf relnofollow titlehereherea. Its extremely nice and makes it easy to get information about past credit card transactions that my company has processed. Ive already worked with it already, so actually using it isnt the issue. Im at the point where I can hack together an app that does what is needed at the moment, or I can design something that is actually good and will be useful in a variety of programs that I could possibly make. Currently, Ive been writing down ideas as they come to me, then making classes with appropriate methods to simplify calls to the API, then feeling out all of the possible features this will require. Once I get a prototype working, I plan to go back and design this entirely and then go ahead and create it. p  pThe problem I have no senior programmer to rely on and am still going through college learning design patterns, data structures and programming in general. I know a little bit about a lot of concepts, but I dont have more than a basic understanding of a few design patterns. I dont know how I should even attempt to organize this or what to do first. The best way I can ask for help here is to give you an idea of what Im working on and then listening to suggestions of what to look into, which data structures to use, etc. Really, what Im looking for is any suggestion on how I should design this better, as I dont know what I should be using at this point. The rest of this post is an explanation of what Ive done so far, to give you an idea of what Ive been doing and what Im looking for this app to do.p  pIve created a test app to work on and test classes. Heres a picture of the classes so far httpdl.dropbox.comu9210234classes.jpg. Yes, its a mess. All of the code is in the form document, no interfaces or anything. The ReportWrapper class generates an XML request based on parameters such as the date range, report type, etc.. Another class called BaseCall takes the request XML and actually sends it to the API and returns the response. ReportMetaData parses a response from a report metaData request and fills the properties with useful information like the number of data pages. XmlUtility is just a helper class that does things like find out single node values or convert rows of data with unique attributes into keyvalue dictionaries. This is what gets stored in ReportStorage right now  a dictionary with the actual data of the report. The metaData is then used to determine what the fields in the report data are automatically. Page 36 of the Payflow guide I linked above shows what a data response looks like.p  pAfter requesting a data page, the rows are stored in reportStore as XML strings. XmlToAssoc then takes an xml string, tag name, attribute name of that tag which is used as a unique ID by the API, and optionally a child node name. It returns a dictionary with the attribute value as the key and the innerXml as the value. I can then get information on a single transaction by cross referencing the metadata with the field data to get a complete picture of the transaction. Additionally, there is a dataType returned with the field name, which Im going to use later. p  pSo with each report data row I need to store the field name, field type, and value. It would look something like thisp  precodereportData  reportDataRow 1   fieldData 1    Transaction ID, string, VLFA6D1CE4A6   fieldData 2    Time,date,20101219 002141   [...]  reportDataRow 2   fieldData 1    Transaction ID, string, VLFA6D33554C   fieldData 2     Time,date,20101219 080257   fieldData 3     [...]  reportDataRow 3   [...] codepre  pOnce I have the storage figured out, I can move on to other operations, such as sorting, outputting the data to excel with field headers, etc.p

Negative 555 pI have been following some examples of RIA services and although a great concept, i am locked into using a WCF Service not RIA as it is also used by other clients like WPF, and asp.net.p  pTHe good thing about RIA was that the ASYNC calling of the service was hidden but with WCF i presume this is not the case so how is it possible to call a WCF Service from silverlight. Add service Reference and then i presume i have to call and wait for a callbackp  pAny tutorials on thisp  pThis is a real shame for me as i would have liked to use RIA services.p  pThe other doubt i have that comes to mind is the use of Entity models and data annotations. In ria this was really easy, but if i am using standard wcf services then i presume that the entity classes actually i am using ENtity framework will arrive on the client silverlight because i do Add Service Reference Am i correct herep  pWIth Data annotations, ria automatically sent the entity classes with the data annotations from the server ria to the client silverlight  but what is the case with standard WCF services.p  pSo currently i believe that i need a silverlight clietn app and NO ria services but i basically would call to wcf services. p  pThe question that arrises now is should i use a mix of RIA and WCF services silverlight calls RIA and then RIA calls WCF Service...p  pI would really apprecaite any feedback as i am a little lost of the right direction to take...

Negative 555 pI wrote a deployment tool for my own programs based on SQL and Subversion.p  pIm able to create different versions of applications and store them with Subversion while the information for those is stored in SQL.  p  pUntil my deployment tool worked quite fine but now I found a problem.p  pWhen creating a version of an application I checkout the head revision and visualize this in my program.  The latest version can then be edited by deleting, renaming, adding or overwriting files and folders.p  pSay, if I have the following tree structure in my working copyp  precode ProgramFiles    Assemblies    Data       Type 1           ...       Type 2            ...       Type 3           ... codepre  pI want to replace one directory Data. This calls svn delete and after that Directory.Delete, because svn delete just marks the folders for delete when you do a commit. Now I want to add a folder named Data again with new subfolders and files but then I get an exception working copy admin area is missing. As far as I can tell the problem is that the directory .svn under ProgramFiles stores information that the folder Data shall be deleted an if I read this folder it crashes.br I also know that I can commit before adding the folder but that would increase my revision number with a non stable version.p  pHow can I solve this problemp

Negative 555 pThere is a system call known as codesocketcode it creates a socket on the listening server. What I want to understand is a server creates an IPport combination. Let us say telnet uses port 23. Now when the client machines do connections then the port on which the server is listening then the connection there is not on port 23 in fact it is on a different port.My confusion is  on the server side also does the same thing happen. For example I write a server to listen to port 23 then the connections which will be done on server side with different clients how are they differentiated because all of them will be on same port.So how can you make so many connections on the same server port.If some one uses  telnet 23 or ftp 21 or ssh 22 then many people can still login to the same service port on the server i.e. more than one connection for ssh by different users where as ssh is listening only at port 22.So what exactly does the socket do or how is a socket createdp  pstrongUPDATEstrong  p  pI got what is  explained.Depending upon the IPport combination from the client machine where the connection originated rest of the things by the server side can be handled and I think this information probably is used by socket file descriptors. What I see is in codeconnectcode system call which we use as followsp  precodeconnectsockfd,struct sockaddr ampclientaddress,sizet codepre  pwe do pass on  codestruct sockaddr code at the client end which has unique IPport combination I think when server gets this in accept then things proceed. What I want to know further  is the argument at server side p  precodeacceptserversockfd,struct sockaddr ampclientaddress,sizet sizeof struct sockaddr  codepre  pDoes it get that same clientaddress which from client side was passed on using connect system call If yes then the socketdescriptors for the same server listening to many clients are different.What I want to know is how does the data structure at the server side is maintained when it accepts a request from the client.p
Negative 555 pI work with Spring Framework 3.0.5 and Id like to understand the basic principals of Spring.

Here is my codep  precodeimplementation OutlineViewDataSource   idinit      self  [super init]     if self           header  [[NSString alloc] initWithString Header]         child1  [[NSString alloc] initWithString Child 1]         child2  [[NSString alloc] initWithString Child 2]         child3  [[NSString alloc] initWithString Child 3]           return self    idoutlineViewNSOutlineView outlineView childNSIntegerindex ofItemiditem      if item  nil              return header          else              if index  0                      return child1                   if index  1                      return child2                   if index  2                      return child3                    return nil    BOOLoutlineViewNSOutlineView outlineView isItemExpandableiditem      if item  nil              return YES           if item  header              return YES           return NO    NSIntegeroutlineViewNSOutlineView outlineView numberOfChildrenOfItemiditem      if item  nil              return 1           if item  header              return 3           return 0    idoutlineViewNSOutlineView outlineView objectValueForTableColumnNSTableColumn tableColumn byItemiditem       if item  nil              return            return item   end codepre  pMy xib file is basic. Its just a Source List Which is an NSOutlineView configured to look like a Source list. It also comes with two NSTableCellViews preconfigured. I connected the Data Source and Delegate. p  pIf I run this code with the Source List configured as Cell Based it works as expected.... but obvious only text is shown and not the NSTableCellViews. If I configure the Source List to be view based, I get strange behavior. The NSTableCellViews do not show up. But the expand buttons do, and I can select the correct number of items as if they are there. No text shows up either. Furthermore, the objectValueForTableColumn function doesnt execute. If I add another NSTableCellView to the Source List in the xib, the NSTableCellView shows up, but I cannot change the icon or text in it, objectValueForTableColumn still doesnt execute. I attempted to implement viewForTableColumn, but that function also in never called. p  pWhat am I doing wrong. I feel like I am close, but I am missing something basic. Thanks in advance. p

Negative 555 pI understand the principles behind the split tone effect, and would love to use either a color map or tone curves for individual rgb channels. Unfortunately thats not an option for iOS at the moment, as the SDK does not include those filters. p  pThe only hack Ive come up with other than doing a render through opengl is duplicating an image, adjusting hue in the highlights in one, shadows in the other, and combining them.

However, one need to sort each of the k bins, if using quick sort for each bin this is an Onklognk operation, so this step would take Onlognkk. Finally one need to assemble this array, this takes Onk, see a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions7311415howisthecomplexityofbucketsortisonkifweimplementbucketsusinglinthis posta, so the total operation would be Onnlognkk.

Negative 555 pWhen reading document about stateful and stateless bean in Java, I kind of understand but there is this general case making me confusingp  ul liI have a web service, it needs inmemory data to process request, and this data is added up to the memory through web service requests, not by loading from database. To make this simple, please think of the web service provides methods to process students data, but at first, the data of all students in a class need to be put into the memory, assuming that the data is just temporarily so we dont put and load them from any database.li liAssuming at the first step we have 3 clients call to web service to add many students data into the web service.li liAt the second step, each client calls to a web service method, says int getRankstudent, this method implementation is just looping through all students data and check the rank of the inputted student based on his mark on particular subject. And thats all, an integer number will be returned and we do not need to store any clientservice related thing so I guess we dont need a stateful bean. However, since after each call to put student data to the service, that data need to be remained in the memory, it seems we have some kind of stateful thing here but I dont know what it is called and is this make the service called stateful web service.li ul  pThank you for any idea.p

Negative 555 pI have a bit of a dilemma, which to be honest is a fringe case but still poses an issue.p  pCurrently I am using Ninject MVC and bind all my controllers like sop  precodeKernel.BindltSomeControllergt.ToSelf codepre  pWhich works a treat for 99 of things that I have needed to do, however at the moment I am doing some wacky stuff around dynamic routing and dynamic controllers which require me to manually write a method to get the type of a controller from ninject. Now initially I thought it would be easy, but its not... I was expecting that I could get the controller based on its name, but that didnt work.p  precodeKernel.GetltIControllergtSomeController codepre  pThat got me thinking that its probably because it only knows about a binding to SomeController, not IController. So I thought, I can just write all my bindings like sop  precodeKernel.BindltIControllergt.ToltSomeControllergt.NamedSomeController codepre  pThis way it should be easy to get the type of the controller from the name doing the previous code, however if I were to bind this way, I would have a problem when I come to unbind the controllers as plugins can be loaded and unloaded at runtime. So the normalp  precodeKernel.UnbindltSomeControllergt codepre  pWhich was great, will no longer work, and I would have to dop  precodeKernel.UnbindltIControllergt codepre  pHowever then I realised that I need to give it some constraint to tell it which binding for this type I want to unbind, and there seems to be no overloads or DSL available to do this...p  pSo I am trapped between a rock and a hard place, as I need to satisfy the ControllerLookup method, but also need to keep it so I can add and remove bindings easily at runtime.p  precodeprotected override Type GetControllerTypeRequestContext requestContext, string controllerName   ... find and return type from ninject  codepre  pAnyone have any ideasp  pJust incase anyone questions why I am doing this, its because of the way I am loading plugins, Ninject knows about the types and the namespaces, but within the context of creating a controller it doesnt know the namespace just the controller name, so I do this to satisfy the isolation of the plugin, and the location of the dynamic controller, it is a roundabout way of doing it, but it is what people have done with AutoFac before a hrefhttpwww.aaronpowell.comcontrollerpluginswithmvc3 relnofollowExample of similar thing with AutoFacap

Negative 555 pI have worked with struts 1,2 for around an year. Now i need to work on DWR wchich is nothing but an easy way of using ajax. so this question is about how ajax make the data retriveal from server very fast as compared to struts. I did surf thru many articles on net. So i came up with this understanding that in case of struts complete formsform data get submitted and after data retrieaval complete page gets loaded which is not the case with ajax. What happens in ajax is we hit the required java class on server with the minimal data we need to send and after returning from server that particular ui element is refreshed which is main reason why it is faster. Is it correctp

I do not want to convert this project to a plugin project because the same project is used in a legacy application that does not use OSGi.p  pThis is particularly annoying since when I update the JAR eclipse does not pickup the modified class files and all my breakpoints in there go crazy a separate issue.p  pI thought I would be able to edit the project properties for B so that A was a Required project Proeprties  Java Build Path  Projects, and since that essentially includes the source at least I guess that is what the entry in .classpath is doing  I figured I could then export package P from project B. However when I do this, eclipse just complains that plugin project B does not contain package P.p  pI figured I could just link the source folders from A into B but thats not really what I want to do.p  pIf a referenced project A is on the classpath then surely the plugin project A should be able to export those packages, or am I wrong in this assumptionp  pWhat is the best way to achieve what I wantp  pCheers, Jason.p

Negative 555 pI am building a dependency injection framework and part of that process includes looping through all class files in the classpath and storing classes annotated with a specific annotation in an enumeration object. In terms of dependency injection, when a class is loaded, it finds all inject notations and then searches through all the classes that contain an injectResource notation, then returns the method values that I need to perform the DI portion.p  pMy question is, it seems a lot more reasonable to build the enumeration class list at compile time, so that when my inject fields need to search those classes I dont have to search every class in the project every single time.p  pI figure I will build the class list at compile time through the servlet config, but where can I store this global list so that I can access it repeatedly throughout the projectp  pOff the top of my head, I am thinking that at compile time I will create a static class that contains the enumeration list, but I dont prefer to use static classes and im not sure if this is the most optimal approach.p
Negative 555 pWe have a set of 6 backends that serve our website.  Because we use multiple datacenters we have found the best performance occurs for us when we have varnish send the request to the localhost httpd server running on port 81.  This of course is a very basic configuration well supported by varnish and can be accomplished using the fallback directorp  precodedirector default fallback       .backend  localbackend       .backend  web1       .backend  web2       .backend  web3  etc...  codepre  pHowever the fallback director tries the other backends in order till it finds a healthy one.  The BIG problem is that in the above config web1 will take all the traffic if localbackend fails   This will overload web1 and it will become sick.  Then all requests go to web3...  and now it will get 3x the normal traffic...  cause a cascading failure.  p  pThus we need instead a config that will allow all requests to sent to the localhost httpd server if it is health, but if not, send the requests to the other healthy servers in a round robin type fashion.p  pThank you in advance for any suggestions and solutions you might think of...  Your help is GREATLY appreciated.p

Negative 555 pIm currently interning at a fashion company whose business revolves around selling online reports to customers. They handle orders manually by phone, email, and allow customers to read certain reports or categories of reports by adding users and setting flags in their backend OMS to grant access. Theyre looking to launch a new, separate site right now that removes the burden from them and decouples the reports from each other. Essentially, they want to sell oneoff reports individually through an online shopping cart.p  pIve been looking for solutions I could integrate with their site, but nothing has offered the tight integration they need as far as I could tell. Reports their content, images, prices, etc. are defined within the OMS, and the site which runs on ASP.NET pulls all the relevant information to display from there. Now, normally, this doesnt sound like much of a problem, except these reports are not downloadable PDFs. Theyre supposed to be generated HTML viewable only online, when the user is logged in. Instead of selling products, the company needs the shopping cart to modify their user database to add purchased reports to users.p  pRight now, the only solution I can see is building a custom shopping cart system, which is the last thing I want to do both in terms of work, and in terms of security for the company. Its time consuming, and tough to get right, so really, I want to avoid it if at all possible. I might have overlooked a system that fits their needs a shopping cart that pulls information from an already built database of product descriptions and is customizable to allow for accessing the OMS database to flag reports for users, which is why Im asking. Is there a system like this Or is a custom solution really necessaryp

Negative 555 pMagento is acting a bit weird and not quite sure why.p  pIt was working before but now when I add an attribute to an attribute set and then create a configuration product when I get to the select configurable products stage the attributes I check dont show up on the actual product creation page.p  pBut heres the strange thing. Its as if the system inverts the options. E.g if I have 3 attributes on there and I select all three, on the product creation I cannot see any of my chosen attributes.p  pIf I select the first and third attributes when I click continue the second attribute shows up etcbut not the actual ones I selected.p  pSo in essence it seems to show the attributes I dont actually select. The opposite of what it should do.p  pHope someone can shed some light and help fix. No idea whats going on.p  pThanks for readingp
Negative 555 pI have a simple codeJFramecode and a codeJTablecode on the frame. Users can supply data into the rows of the table. One of the requirements is that the new data either can be saved or discarded after closing the frame. I thought that the easiest way to accomplish this behaviour is the followingp  ol lipoverride the codesetVisiblecode method of the frame and clone the codeDefaultTableModelcodes data vector.pli lipadd a codeWindowListenercode to the frame and react for the codeWindowClosingcode events. This way, the window listener can decide whether the model should be reset to the model that was saved before.pli ol  pHere is the relevant code snippet p  precodeOverride public void setVisibleboolean b    save the original models only if setVisible invoked with true do not save the model when hiding the frame   if b      Vector cloned  Vector userTableModel.getDataVector.clone     Vector headerNames  new Vector     originalModel  new CustomTableModelcloned, headerNames      super.setVisibleb  codepre  pActually, something weird is happening. After I clone the data vector, the table cant be rendered and this leads to the following exception p  pre Exception in thread AWTEventQueue0 java.lang.ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException 0  0     at java.util.Vector.elementAtVector.java470     at javax.swing.table.DefaultTableModel.getValueAtDefaultTableModel.java650     at asc.model.CustomTableModel.getValueAtCustomTableModel.java74     at javax.swing.JTable.getValueAtJTable.java2720 pre  pThe table is not in connection to the codeoriginalModelcode in any way. It is a surprise for me because, in theory, the cloning shouldnt affect the tables model. The intention of originalModel is to hold a reference to the newly created copy of the table model. After I commented out the creation of the codeoriginalModelcode, everything worked fine.p  pAnother interesting thing is when I added an empty codeStringcode to the codeheaderNamescode vector, the table renderer throws almost the same codeArrayIndexOutOfBoundscode exception, but with this endingp  pre Exception in thread AWTEventQueue0 java.lang.ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException 1  1 pre  pIn that case, the first column of the first row rendered perfectly.p  pMy codeCustomTableModelcode is extended from codeDefaultTableModelcode, and it does not use any special method. The constructor simply passes the data vector and the header vector to the superclass.p  pI hope someone could help to resolve the problem. Thanks in advance.p

Negative 555 pIm a moderate to good PHP programer and have experience with terminalshell scripts but what Im trying to wrap my head around is the logics behind background processes and is most certainly not Cron or Cron Jobs but a continual flow of data.p  pI recently talked to someone who made a little web app that worked with the twitter streaming API and a hrefhttpsgithub.comfennbphirehose relnofollowPhirehosea to gather tweets and save them to a DB. Now sounds simple but all this happens in the background as a process. What Im ineptly used to isp  pcall process  process finishes  handle data from process.p  pWhat is so different about this is that it happens all the time non stop. I remember there was also so talk of socket connection as well.p  pSo my questions are p  ol liWhen executing a background process, is it a continual loop of specific function Thats all that I can logically conclude, or does it some how stay open and happenli liWhat does a socket connection do in this equation li liIs the any form of latency inherit from running this type of processli ol  pI know this is not a code specific type of question but I cant find much information regarding this type of question. p

So basically, for each row the value in the new column should be the value from the budget column  1 if the symbol in the currency column is a euro sign, and the value in the new column should be the value of the budget column  0.78125 if the symbol in the currency column is a dollar sign.p  pI know how to add a column, fill it with values, copy values from another column etc. but not how to fill the new column conditionally based on the value of another column. p  pAny suggestionsp

Negative 555 pIm making a parental controlaccountability app for android.  It consists of a monitoring service that runs in the background and starts when the phone is booted.p  pUnfortunately, I have found that when android is started in Safe Mode, services are not started automatically, and because of this my app has a serious flaw.p  pWhile in safe mode, the web and other apps can be started without my monitoring service running.p  pI thought that if it isnt possible to monitor app activity while in safe mode, maybe I could at least have my app detect if the phone was previously in safe mode.

Negative 555 pI am using JQuery and JavaScript for an input form for time values, and I cant make JavaScript to provide the intended reaction to incorrect input format.  p  pWhat do I do wrong...p  pI have a set of 3 text inputs with class azeit and under these a number of others of class projekt. All are used to input time values. As soon as the user exits the field I validate the format, do a calculation with it and display the result of this in a field with id summe1. This works. If the format is incorrect, I display an alert and what I emwantem to do is return the focus to the field after emptying it. However, the focus never gets returned although it will get emptied all right.

I hope someone can emseeem whats wrong.p  pOne point Id like to mention is that I tried binding the handler to onblur and onfocus as well. When I bind it to onfocus the focus does get reset to the field, but the last field the user enters will not update the field summe1 correctly because this would need focusing another field of the same class.p

Negative 555 pI am looking for a method to pass property itself to a function. Not value of property. Function doesnt know in advance which property will be used for sorting.

Is this possible  Are there code examplesp  pIf possible, can this also be applied for zoomingp  pI have a performance issue when running on a lower end system windows tablet, where panning just uses up too much cpu and ends up unusable.  The scope is 2000 graphic objects.p
Negative 555 pI copied a simple code snippet from a site and adjusted it to a game I was trying to hack. An old game with no multiplayer, basically just to practice all this memory editing stuff. Every time my program successfully returns a window handle, but then fails to return the process handle. Here is my code p  precodeinclude stdafx.h include ltiostreamgt include ltWindows.hgt  using namespace std  int tmainint argc, TCHAR argv[]      long address  0x47C0F04     int newvalue  200      DWORD newvaluesize  sizeofnewvalue      HWND hWnd  FindWindow0, LNo One Lives Forever     HANDLE pHandle      DWORD pid       ifhWnd  0           cout ltlt Found windowx.n          GetWindowThreadProcessIdhWnd, amppid         pHandle  OpenProcessPROCESSALLACCESS, FALSE, pid            else          cout ltlt Cant find windown           ifpHandle 0           WriteProcessMemorypHandle, LPVOIDaddress, LPVOIDnewvalue, newvaluesize, 0             cout ltlt Written to memory successfullyn           else           cout ltlt Couldnt get handle.n           CloseHandlepHandle     return 0  codepre  pThe game is from 2000 if I recall correctly really awesome game by the way so Im assuming it doesnt have any advanced antihack shield, since I can also pretty much edit the value of that address in cheat engine and it works with no hassle. p  pEDIT Ill just explain what exactly happens. It always prints Found window but then it directly prints Couldnt get handle. I dont get any compiler errors Im compiling in Microsoft Visual C 2010 Express p

Negative 555 pI had an idea to create a report printing dialog that could be configurable, e.g. i made a listbox on it, read available reports that are registered in a database. Then, an user could just click on one item in the listbox, click print lets omit any report parameters for the sake of this question. Adding any new report could be as simple as registering a new dll in the database. All report dlls shoud have a commonly named PrintReport function. p  pAlso, printing should be easy for a programmer writing these dlls. He is given a pointer to an object that he could use for gdiplus drawing.p  pHeres what i didp  ul licreated said dialogli licreated a namespace PRINTOUT and some classes in it one of them is Print, which contains fully initialized GdiplusGraphics object and a vector of pointers to metafiles used for print previewli lipcreated this universal function in the dll which is declared asp  precodeextern C declspecdllexport int PrintReportPRINTOUTPrint prn, LONGPTR ReportData codepreli lipi then created an object and called the dll library in the following wayp  precodetypedef BOOL tFUNCPRINTOUTPrint , LONGPTR tFUNC fFUNCreinterpretcastlttFUNCgtGetProcAddressLibInst, PrintReport as a pointer, because i will delete it before unloading a dll.

Negative 555 pUsing Groovy 2.0 beta....p  pGot a bean that has both simple i.e. primitive and complex i.e. other beans as children properties.  Want to recursively copy properties from a bean instance into a new bean and apply function calls per property.  For example, a property might contain an expression i.e. something representing a value that hasnt been evaluated and during the clonecopy phase I want to apply an evaluation so the new bean gets a concrete value.p  pNew to Groovy and my stomach tells there is a simple way to handle this.  Beans are written in Groovy.p  pFor examplep  precodeSource.name xpathapplicationServername Source.type Server Source.create.name com.beaNamedomain.name,TypeDomain .... codepre  pthe strongnamestrong, strongtypestrong fields are simple part of the Source class while strongcreatestrong is complex nested property.

The problem is that on one box the USB thumb drive does not become ready after the format in a consistent way.

The methods are spread across various classes this makes life difficult when an enum is extended for example, when you add a new codePaintercode. To make maintenance a little bit easier, I have written some unit tests of the following formp  precode If this test fails please check that the following methods are still OK   MyClass.GetYearOfBirth, MyOtherClass.IsModernAllCases .   There is no guarantee that the above list is uptodate or complete. [Test] public void PainterCountTest      int numberOfMembers  Enum.GetValuestypeofNotificationID.Length     Assert.AreEqual5, numberOfMembers  codepre  pIn this example, codeIsModernAllCasescode is just a variation of codeIsModerncode which refers explicitly to all 5 possible values of the codePaintercode enum.p  pThis test is better than nothing, but its clumsy. It would be a little less clumsy if you could write something like thisp  precode[Test] public void PainterCountTest      int numberOfMembers  Enum.GetValuestypeofNotificationID.Length      int numberOfCasesgetYearOfBirth  CaseCounterMyClass.GetYearOfBirth     Assert.AreEqualnumberOfCasesgetYearOfBirth, numberOfMembers      int numberOfCasesmodern  CaseCounterMyOtherClass.IsModernAllCases     Assert.AreEqualnumberOfCasesmodern, numberOfMembers  codepre  pIn this scenario, at least you dont have to modify the unit test when you extend the enum. p

So a fake Email is not accepted.p  pIs there any type of plugin out there that have these featuresp
Negative 555 pIm trying to implement a logic where Im trying to subtract each element of an array from every other element of the array and then find the minimum difference of the result.p  peg  a[10,7,3,6]p  pso I subtract 10 from every other element of the array to begin with result will be 3,7,4 then move over to the next element which is 7 and then subtract it from the rest of the elements of the array result will be 4,1, take the next element i.e 3 and subtract it with the remaining element 6 result  3.  Note Im need to take absolute values of the result for my actual problem. Now as you can see, the minimum difference of the result of this subtraction process is 1.p  pI have managed to write a code till this point.

Negative 555 pI have a Sencha Touch app which works fine in Chrome. However, when packaged as an Android app using eclipse and the Applaud bundle, it develops a rather odd behaviour, which may be related to SoftKeyboardDetect.p  pThe user may tap a checkbox to enter a comment about information displayed. That unhides a text area where they can write their comment. They then tap a button to continue. The information which was displayed is replaced by new information and again they can check a checkbox to enter a comment. Tapping the continue button causes the checkbox to be unchecked and the textarea to be hidden. p  pI find that if the user enters a comment on the first information and then taps the continue button, the continue button remains depressed and has to be tapped a second time in order to continue.p  pI note that hitting the continue button causes the SoftKeyboardDetect event to be fired and wonder if this is what is causing the problemp  pIf I change the code so that, when the user presses continue, the textarea remains displayed I.e. Is not hidden, the problem goes away, which leads me to suppose that the phonegap class LinearLayoutSoftKeyboardDetect, which responds to changes in height, is behind the problem. Does anyone know how I can disable that phonegap behaviourp

Negative 555 pThere is a TextBlock element in my WPF view and it is databound to a string property in the view model.

Negative 555 pIve been browsing all over the web in search of enlightenment about continuations, and its mind boggling how the simplest of explanations can so utterly confound a JavaScript programmer like myself. This is especially true when most articles explain continuations with code in Scheme or use monads.p  pNow that I finally think Ive understood the essence of continuations I wanted to know whether what I do know is actually the truth. If what I think is true is not actually true, then its ignorance and not enlightenment.p  pSo, heres what I knowp  pIn almost all languages functions explicitly return values and control to their caller. For examplep  precodevar sum  add2, 3  alertsum  function addx, y      return x  y  codepre  pNow in a language with first class functions we may pass the control and return value to a callback instead of explicitly returning to the callerp  precodeadd2, 3, function sum      alertsum   function addx, y, cont      contx  y  codepre  pThus instead of returning a value from a function we are continuing with another function.

Negative 555 phere is the challengep  pThe servicebusiness layer has a REST JSON interface. There are two kinds of clients which can call the API The webapp, which is running in a browser and a mobileapp Android. Both of them are public. Everyone who uses the authorized  webapp or the authorized  mobileapp should have access to the resources. All unauthorized clients scripts, for instance should be prohibited.p  pNote There are no limitations how many or which users have access to the service layer  client public key certificates probably cant be used. Only the the client software has to be authorized.p  pIn my opinion the only one solution is by obscurity.p  h2Ideash2  ul liLoad a random JSfunction lets call it the challenge from the server, which is executed in the browser or app, fingerprints the browser in a specific way browser flaws, computes a result and send the result back with every RESTAPI call.li ul  pDo you have any further ideas or suggestionsp  pThank you in advance amp sorry for my bad englishp  h2Edith2  pMy question has nothing to do with user authentification andor authorization but strongclientsoftwarestrong authentification  authorization.p  pThe background of my question is, that there is a RESTful backend for my own applications android  web and I dont want that someone creates his own clientsoftware on top of it.

The result would be that after my program runs the completion of Go the result would be that the archive folder cbackup would contain folders One, Two, and Three with the txt files inside of them, in addition, cbackupOnemytest.txt, etc.p  pI want to incorporate this in my current code, and feel I am really close but think I need to come up with some recurrision to get the right directory structure.

Negative 555 pI am currently exploring different networking interfaces  and came across tuntap. I got confused about one part which was creating sockets. p  pCan we create regular sockets with well know ports on the ip address assigned to tuntap interface p  pIs it possible to create sockets for both tun and tap interfaces p  pI apologies if it is too basic to ask it here. I could not find enough online doc on this subject.p  pP.S. I think as it is a networking interface, it should be possible. p
Negative 555 pin discreet time, I have 2 balls whose positions are determined by numerical method.p  ptesting for collision is just d lt r1  r2, thats the 1st step. the 2nd step is to strongdetermine the time of collision impact so I can obtain the normal vector when the collision happened and apply the proper collision responsestrong lt the process is very consuming, is there a simpler way to solver this like some sort of approximation to simplify the calculationsp  pit would be easy if its just 2 dots, but the balls have radius.

Negative 555 pI am trying to build a decorator that can inspect the wrapped functions arguments, the context for the need is to allow easier validation of certain arguments before they hit the function, avoiding the boiler plate of checking in every place I need said checkvalidation.p  pThis is not a difficult decorator to write though, and this gets the job done to make sure a value is not None for examplep  precodedef checkargfunc     def wrappedvalue         assert value is not None         funcvalue     return wrapped codepre  pThe above example is not production code, it is merely an example of something that will work, but the problem becomes apparent when the function to decorate can have other decorators being used.p  pIn that case, the above decorator example will not work, because codevaluecode can now be another decorator. I could add another nested function here but it looks like there should be a better way of dealing with it programmatically, plus, it would break whenever the number of decorators change.p  pHow could I get to the arguments of the wrapped function regardless of the number of decorators used by itp  pEDIT I shouldve noted than I am not simply stacking decorators, I am using one decorator that decorates reusable decorators. In the example above I would reuse that in this contextp  precodecheckarg def someotherdecoratorfunc     def wrappedargs, kw         ...  some interaction here     return wrapped codepre  pAs I was writing this edit, I realized that the codecheckargcode decorator was in the wrong place, it shouldve been in the codewrappedcode function call within the codesomeotherdecoratorcode.p
Negative 555 pIm struggling with managing dynamically built event handlers in javascript.p  pIn several places, I build forms, or controls in which specific events mainly mouseovers, mouseouts, clicks need to be handled.p  pThe trick is that in a significant number of cases, the event handler itself needs to incorporate data that is either generated by, or is passedinto the function that is building the form or control.p  pAs such, Ive been using eval to construct the events and incorporate the appropriate data, and this has worked somewhat well.p  pThe problem is I keep seeinghearing things like You should never use eval as well as a couple of increasingly ugly implementations where my dynamicallybuilt event handler needs to dynamically build other event handlers and the nested evals are pretty obtuse to put it mildly.p  pSo Im here, asking if someone can please show me the better way native javascript only please, Im not implementing any thirdparty libraries.p  pHeres a crude example to illustrate what Im talking aboutp  precodefunction CreateInputcontrolName,type,activeStyle,dormantStyle,whenClicked      var inp  document.createElementinput     inp.id  controlName     inp.type  type     inp.style.cssText  dormantStyle     evalinp.onfocus  function  this.style.cssText    activeStyle        evalinp.onblur  function  this.style.cssText    dormantStyle        evalinp.onclick  function    whenClicked        return inp  codepre  pThis function obviously would let me easily create lots of different INPUT tags and specify a number of unique attributes and event actions, with just a single function call for each. Again, this is  an extremely simplified example, just to demonstrate what Im talking about, in some cases with the project Im on currently, the events can incorporate dozens of lines, they might even make dynamic ajax calls based on a passed parameter or other dynamically generated data. In more extreme cases I construct tables, whose individual rowscolumnscells may need to process events based on the dynamically generated contents of the handler, or the handlers handler.p  pInitially, I had built functions like the above as sop  precodefunction CreateInputcontrolName,type,activeStyle,dormantStyle,whenClicked      var inp  document.createElementinput     inp.id  controlName     inp.type  type     inp.style.cssText  dormantStyle     inp.onfocus  function  this.style.cssText  activeStyle      inp.onblur  function  this.style.cssText  dormantStyle      evalinp.onclick  function    whenClicked        return inp  codepre  p...but I found that whatever the last assigned value had been for activeStyle, and dormantStyle became the value used by all of the handlers thusly created instead of each retaining its own unique set of styles, for example. That is what lead me to using eval to lockin the values of the variables when the function was created, but this has lead me into nightmares such as the following p  pThis is a sample of one dynamicallybuilt eventhandler that Im currently working on and which uses a nested eval functionp  precode    evalinput.onkeyup  function                InputParsethis,ucwords               var tId    myName  This.nodeName  SearchTable  uidNo                 var table  document.getElementByIdtId               if this.value.lengthgt2                    var val  this.value.indexOf, gt0   this.value.substr0,this.value.indexOf,  this.value                   var search  Global.LoadDatafncitySearchamplimit3ampvalue  encodeURIval                   if table                        while table.rows.lengthgt0  table.deleteRow0                        table.style.displayblock                    else                        table  document.createElementtable                       table.id  tId                       ApplyStyleString  baseStyle  positionabsolutetop20pxleft0pxdisplayblockborder1px solid blackbackgroundColorrgba224,224,224,0.90zIndex1000,table                       var div  document.getElementById  divName                         if div  div.appendChildtable                                       if search.rowCountgt0                        for var i0 iltsearch.rowCount i                            var tr  document.createElementtr                           tr.id  SearchRow  i    uidNo                             tr.onmouseover  function  ApplyStyleStringcursorpointercoloryellowbackgroundColorrgba40,40,40,0.90,this                            tr.onmouseout  function  ApplyStyleStringcursordefaultcolorblackbackgroundColorrgba224,224,224,0.90,this                            evaltr.onclick  function                                function setid,value                                    var o  document.getElementByIdid                                   if o ampamp o.value  o.value  value  else  alertCould not find   id                                                               set  myName  This.nodeName  CityId  uidNo  ,  search.idi                                set  myName  This.nodeName  ProvId  uidNo  ,  search.provIdi                                set  myName  This.nodeName  CountryId  uidNo  ,  search.countryIdi                                 set  input.id  ,  search.namei                                                           var td  document.createElementtd                           var re  new RegExpval, gi                           td.innerHTML  search.namei.replacere,ltspan stylefontweightboldgt1ltspangt  ,   search.provinceNamei  ,   search.countryNamei                           tr.appendChildtd                           table.appendChildtr                                           else                        var tr  document.createElementtr                       var td  document.createElementtd                       td.innerHTML  No matches found...                      tr.appendChildtd                       table.appendChildtr                                   else                    if table table.style.display  none                            codepre  pCurrently, Im having problems getting the nested eval to bind the .onclick event to the tablerow, and, as you can see, figuring out the code is getting pretty hairy debugging too, for all the known reasons...

Negative 555 pIm struggling with getting references and not using Ext.getCmp...  I understand why it is best not to use Ext.getCmp in production apps, primarily because of potential confusion around duplicated DOM ids.  Ive create a basic sample below that Ive put some comments in that Im hoping, if I can find answers to will help me better understand how to get references.p  pIm also looking for some really good explanations, tutorials, etc on this topic.  I gather that learning how to do ComponentQuerys would be best but Im not even sure if that is the case.  So without further words, here the code.

Negative 555 pIm receiving a base64encoded zip file in the form of a string from a SOAP request.br I can decode the string successfully using a standalone program, b64dec.exe, but I need to do it in a java routine.  Im trying to decode it emtheZipStringem with Apache commonscodec1.7.jar routinesp  precodeimport org.apache.commons.codec.binary.Base64   import org.apache.commons.codec.binary.StringUtils StringUtils.newStringBase64.decodeBase64theZipString, ISO88591         codepre  pZip file readers open the resulting file and show the list of content files but the content files have CRC errors.p  pI compared the result of my java routine with the result of the b64dec.exe program using UltraEdit and found that they are identical with the exception that eight different bytevalues, where ever they appear in the b64dec.exe result, are replaced by 3F  in mine.  The values and their ISO88591 character names are A4 currency, A6 broken bar, A8 diaeresis, B4 acute accent, B8 cedilla, BC vulgar fraction 14, BD vulgar fraction 12, and BE vulgar fraction 34. p  pIm guessing that the StringUtils.newString function is not translating those eight values to the string output, because I tried other 8bit character sets UTF8, and cp437.  Their results are similar but worse, with many more 3F,  substitutions.  p  pAny suggestions  What character set should I use for the newString function to convert a .zip string  Is the Apache function incapable of this translation  Is there a better way to do this decodep  pThanksp

Negative 555 pI am trying to serialize an object containing a list of very large composite object graphs 200000 nodes or more using Protobufnet. Basically what I want to achieve is to save the complete object into a single file as fast and as compact as possible. p  pMy problem is that I get an outofmemoryexception while trying to serialize the object. On my machine the exception is thrown when the file size is around 1.5GB. I am running a 64 bit process and using a StreamWriter as input to protobufnet.

Negative 555 pI have a question about how closures work in relation to garbage collection. I have created a javascript application that seems to be continually adding objects that dont get cleaned up when I create a new project. In my code the application clears out all the references to the newly created objects and I make sure to unbind all events and dispose them. However when I look in the chrome heap profiler this is what I seep  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comAmFH9.png altenter image description herep  pWhen I click on the references of the objects I can see there are pointers to the objects in the jQuery proxy function. specifically the variable contextp  pFrom what I can see, the proxy function creates a closure and that closure has a reference to the viewport when its constructed. This is how Im using the proxies in Viewport3Dp  precodein constructor of Viewport3D this.keydownProxy  jQuery.proxy this.onKeyDown, this  jQuerydocument.on keydown, this.keydownProxy  codepre  p...p  precodeIn dispose method of viewport jQuerydocument.off keydown, this.keydownProxy  this.keydownProxy  null codepre  pSo as you can see I am removing the events as well as nullifying the proxy where the closure reference exists. p  pSo why does the viewport3d still exist in memory even after the events have been removed and the proxies nullified I know its that section of the code because when I comment out all those created proxies, the class is fully garbage collected.p  pIf its because there is a loose pointer somewhere else keeping this alive, is there any other way I can see where it is coming from in Chromep  pThanks for any guidance you can provide.p

Negative 555 pI have two intertwined problems to solve.p  pMy stock photography website is driven by a PERLscripted program called ImageFolio, purchased in 2005. The program allows for display of photos by categories, or by searching keywords, which then deliver pages of thumbnail images matching the contents of an entire category, or images with keywords or image titles matching the search terms. Clicking a thumbnail image displays a dynamically generated page showing a larger view of the image. p  pSince the same images can be displayed from multiple searches, its important to designate a emcanonicalem page in the HEAD section of the dynamically generated pages by using a strongRegExstrong expression to capture the relevant variable information from the dynamic URL, to create and specify a stronglink relcanonicalstrong tag in the HEAD section of each page.  Corresponding strongMODREWRITEstrong statements are required in the .htaccess file to translate those static canonical links back to properly structured dynamic links to deliver the proper content.p  pSome typical dynamically generated URLs and preferred static URL substitutes arep  pemDirect link to a category displaying a page of thumbnails from that categoryembr strongDYNAMICstrong www.artminds.comcgibinImageFolio4imageFolio.cgidirectAthleticsandSportsbr strongDESIRED STATIC CANONICALstrong www.artminds.comstockphotosAthleticsandSportsbr strongMODREWRITEstrong Same as dynamic above  p  pemSearch for images by clicking a clickable keyword on an image pageembr strongDYNAMICstrong www.artminds.comcgibinImageFolio4imageFolio.cgiimg0ampsearchsix20packampcatallampboolphrasebr strongDESIRED STATIC CANONICALstrong www.artminds.comphotosearchsixpack.htmlbr strongMODREWRITEstrong cgibinImageFolio4imageFolio.cgisearchsixpack  p  pemSearch for images by typing a keyword in the search boxembr strongDYNAMICstrong www.artminds.comcgibinImageFolio4imageFolio.cgisearchsixpackampboolandampcatampx0ampy0br strongDESIRED STATIC CANONICALstrong www.artminds.comsixpack.htmlbr strongMODREWRITEstrong cgibinImageFolio4imageFolio.cgisearchsixpack  p  pemDisplay single image page from clicking a thumbnailembr strongDYNAMICstrong www.artminds.comcgibinImageFolio4imageFolio.cgiactionviewamplinkOnLocationampimage1038310.jpgampimg0ampsearchsix20packampcatallampttampboolandbr strongDESIRED STATIC CANONICALstrong www.artminds.com1038310Muscularyoungmanposingshirtlesswithcowboyhatandbluejeans.htmlbr strongMODREWRITEstrong cgibinImageFolio4imageFolio.cgiactionviewamplinkOnLocationampimage1038310  p  pemstrongNotestrong The long file name in the DESIRED CANONICAL immediately above comes from the image caption which is displayed in the HTML Title Tag of the image display page, retrieved via variables in the script program that extract the embedded metadata in the image file.

Negative 555 pRight now, Im binding events to the strongparent elementstrong of my custom tags rendered content, then using classes to target the event onto the element which my custom tag actually renders. I feel this is likely to cause strange bugs. For instance, if anyone on my team places two custom tags using the same targetingclasses under the same immediate parent element, it would cause multiple events to fire, associated with the wrong elements.p  pHeres a sample of the code Im using nowp  precode.views.tags     toggleProp          template ltspan classtogglegtinclude tmplcontentltspangt,         onAfterLink function               var prop  this.tagCtx.view.data             this.parentElem.onclick, .toggle, function                   prop.valueprop.value                      ,         onDispose function               this.parentElem.offclick, .toggle                    ... other custom tags simply follow the same pattern ...  codepre  pBy the time we hit codeonAfterLinkcode, is there any reliable way to access the rendered DOM Element or DOM Elements corresponding to the custom tag itself With no risk of hitting the wrong element by mistake I understand that the custom tag may be text without an HTML Element, but it would still be a text node, right Could I even bind events to text nodesp  pIn other places, and using far older versions of JsViews, Ive bound events after the render using sometimes a lot of targeting logic built into the rendered elements as codedatacode attributes. Not only is this a far more fragile method than I like for accessing the rendered data, it would be incredibly risky and convoluted to try to apply this approach to some of our deeplynestedandcollectionridden templates.p  pI also dont like needing to insert a codespancode with my custom tag, just so I can apply classes to it, but if its still necessary for the event, Ill cope.p  pI ask, then, what is a safe, modular way to bind events to the DOM so that I also have access to the data rendered directly against those elementsp  pstrongEditstrong As an additional concern, using codeonAfterLinkcode wont let me bind events to nondatalinked rendered content. This may be part of the design intent of JsViews vs pure JsRender, but I dont yet understand why that would be the case.p

Negative 555 pIm so new to web development that Im not exactly sure how to ask this question, but heres the problem Im facing.p  pIm developing a website for a particular department in a university with its own stylesheets that are applied but that Im unable to edit. Im trying to make a collage of images for the purpose of site navigation  when you mousehover over an image, I want a different image to be swapped. The first method I used was javascriptp  precodeltdiv classboxgt lta targetblank hrefhttpbike.cofc.edugtltimg src..biking onmouseoverthis.src..bikinglabel onmouseoutthis.src..biking classicon altbiking gtltagt  ltdivgt codepre  pThis worked beautifully within the cms, but when I published the image swap didnt occur  onmouseover caused the first image to disappear but the second image was not called successfully, and onmouseout didnt reverse the broken swap.p  pI thought that perhaps the university wasnt allowing my javascript, so I tried using just css and htmlp  precodespan.imgswapbiking    backgroundimageurl   backgroundsize100px 100px    border 1px solid black   backgroundrepeat norepeat displayblock  span.imgswapbikinghover img    visibilityhidden   ltstylegt ltspan classimgswapbikinggt  ltimg src altbiking gt ltspangt codepre  pAgain, this accomplished the same effect within cms, but when I published, the swap occurred and was reversible, but the background image was not successfully called. Im afraid that background isnt recognized.p  pMy fundamental confusion is understanding how functionality is lost when publishing websites. I dont really understand what goes on between the time that my site looks good on cms and the time that it is stripped when it is published. General guidance on how to know what sorts of scripts and css changes will work would be helpful if possible. I should mention that I am including css at the top of the webpage because I dont have access to the stylesheet  will the university stylesheet always override mine Thanks in advance.p  pWaltp

Negative 555 pIm trying to use the GCS client library with my app engine app and I ran into this  p  pIn order to use the client library in your app, put the srccloudstorage directory in your sys.path so Python can find it.p  pFirst, does this mean I need to move the directory into my sys.path OR does it meed to add the srccloudstorage to my PATH environment variablep  pSecond, when I print sys.version and sys.path from the App Engine Interactive Console, I see a Python Version of 2.7.2, but when I print from my Terminal on a Mac, I get the Python I want to use and installed via Homebrew  2.7.5.

Negative 555 pI want to make a priority queue class that I can reuse again and again in different programs, which stores only one typeclass in it.p  pI can keep out any other typesclasses from entering the queue by using compareTo methods, but that means the queue class should require the compareTo method in all of typesclasses that enter the queue.p  pI know that in Java, you can make a class implement Comparable to ensure that that class implements a compareTo method.  So I was wondering if there was something similar in c.p  pAs well, I cant use templates, so, any alternatives would be appreciated.  The reason that templates are off limits arent known to me either, the one asking for this program wont shed some light on that.  It must be purely my own code for the priority queue as well.p

Negative 555 pWe have a wcf webservice that an external client will be using to provide requests.  This webservice the webservice calls another wcf service  the agent where the business logic is implemented.  p  pThe agent also monitors activity in the database and when the requested information is ready often days later the agent generates an object containing the requested data.

Can I get both visible I tried using the JPanel but its going to make paddingmargin around itself, and i dont want that. I tried removing it using createEmptyBorder0, 0, 0, 0 but nothing changed..p  pactually i like dont using jpanel, because when i resize my jpanel if there is not space enough for the title it becomes like My Tit.., instead if i put the button in the JPanel it doesnt, its like theres something above the text..p

Negative 555 pI have a codeTextViewcode.

On the other hand, if the desired contextual action menu is shown, the text is not highlighted. p  pI have been able to zero it down to the codereturncode statement in the codeonLongClickcode function in the codeonLongClickListenercode.

Negative 555 pWhen a user logs in and is redirected to members page then logs out wouldnt clicking the back button make the form data resubmit, check that its ok and redirect again When this happens the user is not able to view the members page again because it checks for a session variable but resending all the information with a page refresh or the back button would make them log in again so even though this system works perfectly, what is the reason below the hood that makes it workp  pI have created log in systems that redirect the user if the information is correct and this solves the problem of page refreshes and back button relog ins. I just dont understand how, and why this works.p  pAll answers are very appreciated. p  pFor all those who share this same question.

Negative 555 pI am currently working on a android game and wanted to add some variety to the gameplay by speeding up the overall movement just jumping. I find the acceleration that the gravity of box2d added nice, so want to keep it. Increasing the gravity should help me to speed up the jump. But how do i calculate the respective x and y velocities so i preserve the height and the distance of the jump, so it remains the same. I found two different formulas to calculate something like this, but there are still some problem.  The first would bep  precodeghm  v codepre  pThis could be used to preverse the height.p  precodev  sqrtd  sqrtg  sqrtsin2angle codepre  pWhere codedcode would be the distance, therefore this could be used the preserve the distance. The problem with both of them is, that because the gravity would be something like code0, 8code, the xvalue would never make sense. Is there some easy way to combine both methods, or just another formula i didnt find I am also in for completly new ideas. Thanks a lotp

Negative 555 pIm using Traits 4 to build a simple interactive GUI application. This application will display a timestamped log of events in a dedicated part of the GUI. This log is currently stored as a String trait.p  pThe default editor or View Not sure on the exact nomenclature for a String trait is a scrollable multiline display widget. When the internal string value is changed, the widget updates to display the new value. If the length of the content exceeds the viewable size of the widget, then a scrollbar appears to allow the user to scroll up and down, across the entire value.p  pIt appears that when the widget refreshes and a vertical scrollbar is then visible content exceeds widget size, the view resets to the start of the value top, and the scrollbar returns to the top also, obscuring the final part of the value.p  pIn my application I wish the latest event in the log at the bottom to always be displayed after a value refresh. But because the view resets to the top of the value, it doesnt follow the latest entry and the user must constantly scroll to the bottom after each refresh. This is unusable in this form.p  pIs there a simple way to configure this traits editorView to scroll from the bottomp  pIf not, how would one go about writing a custom editorView for this String trait Would it be necessary to write a new view from scratch using wxqt4 primitives, or is there some way to derive a new view from the existing one and override only the parts that are needed to implement the desired functionalityp  pHeres some example code that demonstrates the problemp  precode from httpssvn.enthought.comenthoughtticket1619  broken SSL cert from threading import Thread from time import sleep from enthought.traits.api import  from enthought.traits.ui.api import View, Item, ButtonEditor  class TextDisplayHasTraits     string   String      view View Itemstring,showlabelFalse, springyTrue, stylecustom    class CaptureThreadThread     def runself         self.display.string  Camera startedn  self.display.string         nimg  0         while not self.wantsabort             sleep.5             nimg  1             self.display.string  d image capturedn  nimg         self.display.string  Camera stoppedn  class CameraHasTraits     startstopcapture  Button     display  InstanceTextDisplay     capturethread  InstanceCaptureThread      view  View Itemstartstopcapture, showlabelFalse       def startstopcapturefiredself         if self.capturethread and self.capturethread.isAlive             self.capturethread.wantsabort  True         else             self.capturethread  CaptureThread             self.capturethread.wantsabort  False             self.capturethread.display  self.display             self.capturethread.start  class MainWindowHasTraits     display  InstanceTextDisplay,       camera  InstanceCamera      def cameradefaultself         return Cameradisplayself.display      view  Viewdisplay, camera, stylecustom, resizableTrue   if name  main     MainWindow.configuretraits codepre  pClick the Start stop capture button multiple times until the view has filled, and youll observe that subsequent refreshes reset the scrollbar position to the top of the view.p

Negative 555 pId like to get the behavior similar to Messages app also common in most texting apps in iOS7, where in a conversation view swiping right from the left edge of the screen would behave like the back button in a UINavigationController.p  pI have managed to implement this behavior, however, if the keyboard is open in the presenting view, when I start swiping back, the keyboard gets stuck and does not animate with the view to the right as I move my finger. Id like to animate keyboard and the presenting view as one unit, not as if keyboard is on top of the other views and they are animating behind it, which is what I get now see the second screenshotp  pstrongUPDATEstrong Note that the keyboard will eventually go away after the main view animation is finished what I am focused on is the position of keyboard strongduringstrong the swipe process, and when you keep touching the device half of the way, which is not in sync with the actual view. The second screenshot clarifies this desired behavior. I also wonder why it is not the default.p  pIt is easy to replicate the issue by simply creating a new masterdetail iPhone app in Xcode 5.0.2 and adding a Text Field to the detail view preferably somewhere in the upper half in the StoryBoard, running the app, adding an item, tapping on it to go to the detail view and clicking on the text field you added.

Negative 555 pIm wondering what the preferred architecture would be for the following situationp  pIm required to have a .NET application that will perform batch upload of multiple data files concurrently to a SQL Server. This will be invoked from a WPF application which will allow the user to select the files and the destination tables, as well as reporting on the individual progress for each upload including error messages. I have absolutely no problem writing the code for any of this. However, there is a requirement that the user is able to close the WPF application altogether and for the upload process to continue. Further, if the user restarts the WPF application from the same machine, it should be able to get a handle on the existing uploads and report on the status as if the program were never closed.p  pMy question is what are the ways of achieving this and which would seem the most standardsuitablep  pIve considered simply not actually closing the WPF application but hiding all the windows, but this seems a cheat. Would it be best to create a WCF service on the server where the upload is taking place and simply upload the file I dont think I can do that and report progress  etc though. What about a locallyrunning Windows Service, can I achieve a similar effect Should I be thinking of MemoryMappedFilesp  pAppreciate all your thoughts.p

Does anyone have an example how to get Nintex Workflow Tasks in a site collection I guess that CAML query would be used for this.p  pThank you,p  pJakub p

Once I get the Uri, I display that image in the respective tab. p  pBut, I want to make sure that the image is still there with when the user comes back to the app.  Now one option is that i save the uri and then when the app is loaded again, I display the image based on the Uri, as was done when the user initially selected the photo.  The issue with this approach is that I only have the Uri in the app for the image. So if the user deletes that photo from his gallery then i will have nothing to show.p  pSo is there a way to store that image in my appp  pThanks.p

Negative 555 pIve got a nested function inside another JavaScript function the nested function accepts a variable that is passed to the parent.

Originally I was trying to pass the entire text file of characters to MySQL and deal with it in there. However now I think it may be better to cut up the data and deal with it mostly in BaSH. p  pI am running everything from script files and am not the best with BaSH, I actually work mostly with MySQL or other languages like C or Java. p  pI know that you can embed other languages into BaSH scripts however in the end I will still need to pass strings to MySQL to insert and I need to preserve the original values of the text files. p  pSo, is there a way to get these strings to MySQL with the languages to just ignore the characters in the string so it will preserve it and not cause issuesp  precodebinbash cd srvmysqlPROJDBscripts echo  for dir in cat ..pathlist.txt do     for file in binls 1 dir.txt do echo Processing dirdir  filefile cat file  wc     mysql u rpm ppassword showwarnings maxallowedpacket16M call rpmdb.DataButcher utf8cat file      echo Data inserted for  cat dir     echo  done done echo Data parse and insert Done. codepre  pThis is the code I had before then I had a much more complex MySQL procedure that dealt with it. From what I could tell it would hit a character and pass only portions of the text to MySQL which then caused problems in MySQL, and the following lines in the text file tried to run as BaSH and obviously they werent BaSH commands. Hopefully this will help, this is a older project that I keep coming back to and last I looked at it I got hitched up. With a new and fresh mind I am trying to approach it differently. p  pNOTE the procedure in MySQL is called DataButcherp

Negative 555 pI am building a web service with GeoDjango which involves user submitted events including a location.  I created a model field for my location using codedjango.contrib.gis.dbcodep  precodelocation  models.PointFieldsrid900913 codepre  pI chose to specify code900913code as I read that this is the projection used by Google Maps and I am getting the location by placing a marker on a Google map.

I am storing this point in a PostGIS DB using GEOSp  precodelocation  geos.Pointdata[lng], data[lat], srid900913 codepre  pIf I want to view this point on a map, I get the lat and lng from my DB e.g. codelat  location.coords[1]code and use them to centre my map and this works fine.p  pWhen I want to browse a map and display events from DB which lie inside the map bounds I use GeoDjangos codewithincode query and the maps bounds in latlng formatp  precode    bounds  geos.Polygon.frombboxswLng, swLat, neLng, neLat     events  Event.objects.filterlocationwithinbounds codepre  pThis appears to work fine and I display pins on the map corresponding to the latlng of these events.p  pSo far nothing would suggest that anything is going wrong, however I am completely new to this stuff and I want to ensure that Im getting it right for when I inevitably want to use my location data in more complex ways.  The reason Im suspicious is that my Django admin pane does not display the location correctly on the OpenStreetMap.  It shows a point which appears to correspond to the 0,0 point shown a hrefhttpspatialreference.orgrefsrorg6627 relnofollowherea.  The displayed text version of the location field is codeSRID900913POINT1.277482509613037 50.874104373286066code, which is clearly still in latlng.  As I move my mouse around the admin map I can see the displayed coords in the bottom right corner are in 900913 format, and not in latlng.  p  pPlease can you explain how I can store my location points in the correct format, and what advantages this has over simply using latlng my guess is that if I want to specify say a distance in km for lookups, I cant use my latlng locations.p

Negative 555 pIm using UIDocumentInteractionController to share a picture in Instagram and other apps like Whatsapp, Google Drive, Dropbox... as many of you already know the Instagram pictures has the .ig or .igo file extensions.

If I try to open other apps like Whatsapp there isnt any problem and the delegate is called.p  pDo you know how could I take control of this before the system open the mail composer, message composer or social composerp  pThank you so much.p

Negative 555 pI am currently trying to merge three datasets for analysis purposes. I am using certain common fields to establish the connections between the datasets.

I have at least eight CPU cores to dedicate to Neo4j, as long as separate threads dont tie up by locking each others required resources.p  pThe issue is that I dont know how Neo4j builds its Cypher execution plans. For instance, lets say I run the following test queryp  precodeMATCH p1Person,p2Person namep1.name, emailp1.email WHERE p1 ltgt p2  RETURN p1, p2 LIMIT 100 codepre  pDespite the LIMIT clause, Neo4j still takes a considerable amount of time to turn in the results, what makes me wonder whether even for such a limited query Neo4j produces the whole cartesian product table before considering the LIMIT statement. p  pI appreciate any help, whether it addresses this specific issue or just gives me an understanding of how Neo4j generally builds Cypher execution plans and thus how to optimize queries in general. Can legacy Lucene indexes be of any help herep

Negative 555 pIn my project I need to implement an HLS HTTP live Streaming for an android device and it stream to an iOS device to play where android device will record the video and send it to server and iOS device will play the stream from the server using an m3u8 file.

Now I need some third party API or library like ffmpeg, Gstreamer, Xuggler, Jcodec to transcode recorded mp4 to ts files.p  pffmpeg, jffmpeg and Gstreamer have a learning curve and to setup time and also need NDK. So I need some help because I dont have enough time to try one of these please refer me if you know any library which is easy to use and does not have a complex learning and setup time. Like Jcodec which is pure java base and plug and play type library but I dont think it can do this for me as they have mention in there documentation they support h262 codec support yet but i need h264 and ACC for audio.p

Negative 555 pApologies, since this question is somewhat vague and general, and is certainly not reproducible since the code is too complex.

Negative 555 pI have a web application with a video player. When the user presses a button, the video starts playing. Now, I added an animation that starts when the button is clicked, en when it finishes, the video should start playing. The animation is based on setInterval to be more precise, the HTML5 variant, requestInterval.p  pThis works perfectly, but only on a MacPC, because there are restrictions for video playback on Android. When you want a video to actually start playing programmatically, the function that calls the play function of the video element needs to be directly triggered by a user action e.g. click on a button.p  pBefore the animation, this was indeed the case, and everything worked as intended. I need the video to play only after the animation is finished, because there is considerable lag on the animation if the video starts playing when the animation starts.p  pAny ideas or workaroundsp

Negative 555 pIve just upgraded to Django 1.7 and Ive found that a couple of the modules we rely on which are installed by pip have small issues.p  pIve played on a test box and found that each of these modules only needs a couple of lines to be changed to support Django 1.7. Both have import errors which are easily fixed.p  pWhat would be the best way to make a temporary patch to these files p  pIdeally I would like the fix to live with my project until updated modules appear and I can remove it. Were running puppet on the production systems so I could just overwrite the two files with new versions but this seems too easy to lose track of. Monkey patching might work, but as they are import errors Im not sure how to cut this out before it fails.p

Negative 555 pIm a new programmer learning objectivec on my own. Im trying to make an iPad app that will use a countdown timer as the main view and then use an alert to segue into different views depending on different data I pull from a database. I have been working on it for a couple days and I cannot make this timer stop at 0 and fire the alert that will allow the user to segue into the next view. Its ARC enabled.p  pHeres the code for the .hp  precode    import ltUIKitUIKit.hgt  interface ViewController  UIViewController     int eventTime     NSDate eventDate       IBOutlet UILabel timerLabel      NSTimer timer    voidupdateCountDown voidexercisePopup    end codepre  pAnd for the .mp  precodeimport ViewController.h  interface ViewController   end  implementation ViewController   voidviewDidLoad      [super viewDidLoad]      Do any additional setup after loading the view, typically from a nib.  timer  [NSTimer scheduledTimerWithTimeInterval1.0 targetself selectorselectorupdateCountDown userInfonil repeatsYES]     if[timerLabel isEqual 0]          [timer invalidate]         [self exercisePopup]            voidupdateCountDown       eventTime  10     eventDate  [NSDate dateWithTimeIntervalSinceNoweventTime]      NSCalendar calendar  [[NSCalendar alloc] initWithCalendarIdentifierNSCalendarIdentifierGregorian]      int units  NSCalendarUnitHour  NSCalendarUnitMinute NSCalendarUnitSecond      NSDateComponents components  [calendar componentsunits fromDate[NSDate date] toDate eventDate options0]      [timerLabel setText[NSString stringWithFormatldcldcldc, long[components hour], h, long[components minute], m, long[components second], s]]     voidexercisePopup     UIAlertView alert  [[UIAlertView alloc] initWithTitleTime to Exercise messageIts Time to Exercise, Touch the Screen delegateself cancelButtonTitleTouch to Exercise otherButtonTitlesnil]      optional  add more buttons     [alert show]      voiddidReceiveMemoryWarning      [super didReceiveMemoryWarning]      Dispose of any resources that can be recreated.   end codepre  pThe issue Im having is getting this timer to stop at 0 so that the alert will fire. If I leave the  in the if statement then when the app opens the alert immediately fires, but the countdown never starts. If I take it out the countdown goes on forever into negative numbers and such. Im not sure what to have the if statement check for since it seems to think the timerLabel is starting at 0. Ive also tried moving the if statement around, even making it its own method and then trying to call that after the timer loads but nothing Ive tried is working.p  pIm totally lost, Ive been trying all of the solutions I could find on here for the last couple days and none of them work for what Im trying to do, Ive gotten all kinds of errors when Ive implemented them. If anyone has any advice Id really appreciate it.p

Negative 555 pGood evening. p  pI work for a company. I get an assignment to figure out why PDF files cant be downloaded using Android phones. I get an URL which has access to the pdf files. Once it used HTTP protocol and there was no problems. When they change to HTTPS protocol, then the problem comes out. p  pI can download it with my PC using Firefox, Chrome and IE. When I try to access the file using my Android phone Samsung Galaxy Note 2, Android 4.4.2, browser Chrome and one whose icon is a blue globe, the blue download bar appears with the file name saying lt Untitled  and then the download fails.

Negative 555 pI have two resources, codeArticlecode and codeCommentcode. An article can have many comments. A nonAJAX, HTML request is made to load an articles codeshowcode page. The page contains a comments section with a pagination feature that works via AJAX. My question is, where should I put the logic that handles the pagination requests In codearticlescontrollercode or codecommentscontrollercode Even though the primary resource is an instance of codeArticlecode and the AJAX request is being made from the codeArticlecode codeshowcode page, the codeArticlecode resource isnt really involved with paginating comments. Thus, it makes more sense to me that the logic should be processed in codecommentscontrollercode, but I can see how the other side would work as well.p

But now we implement an installer for them and faced a problem Wix installs our services incorrectly.

Negative 555 pas a Linux system programming exercise Ive written my own version of the tree command, which is to read from stdin and write to stdout using only the basic read and write C library functions. Ive done it so that when an asterisk  is entered, the program is terminated. I have managed to get it to work properly, my problem is that I dont emreallyem understand why it works the way it does. What confuses me is the buffer. First of all, here is the code portion in questionp  precodechar buf[1] ... do      readSTDINFILENO, buf, 1     if buf[0]   break     writeSTDOUTFILENO, buf, 1  while buf[0]   ... codepre  pMy idea was to read from stdin char by char, thereby storing the char in buf, check if it was an asterisk, then write the char from buf to stdout.p  pThe behaviour is the following I type a string of any number of chars, press ENTER, that string gets output to stdout, at which point I can type a new char string. If the string ends with an asterisk, the string is output up until the asterisk, then the program is terminated.p  pMy problems arep  p1 buf is sopposed to contain only one char. How is it possible that I enter any number of chars und upon pressing ENTER all of them are output to stdout I would expect one char at a time to be output, or only the last one. How does a onechar buffer store all of those chars Or do many onechar buffers get created By whomp  p2 What is so special about the newline character that prompts the string to be output Why is it not just another char within the string Is it just a matter of definition within the function readp  pThank you for any help in understanding the working of the bufferp

Negative 555 pIm working on some lisp code that munges a CVS repository in order to get it into shape for a git conversion. As such, when something goes wrong it might not be a bug in my code but might instead be an inaccuracy in the input data which needs fixing.p  pDeep down in the bowels of my code, Ill have say some function that merges two date ranges by taking an intersection. If that intersection turns out to be empty, Ill raise an error. This is all good, but my merge dates function is missing lots of the information that the user me needs in order to figure out what went wrong. For example, which CVS master file foo,v was I working on What branch was I thinking about Etc. etc.p  pMy partial solution to this problem is to handle and reraise the error.

That makes sense its the code I wrote. But its not really what I want...p  pIs there a way in Common Lisp to annotate a condition as it hurtles past, without reraising it and, hence, partially unwinding the stack without reporting that in the back tracep  pI gave a reasonable amount of background info about what Im doing in the hope that, if this isnt possible, someone will say Ah, what you should do in this situation is... am I just going about this the wrong wayp

Is it correct to say then, that there is no problem with passing an object pointer through nested functions as below, i.e. there wont be layers of objects allocatedp  precodecase class Parametersname String, id String, values Array[Double] case class Contextid String, a Double, b Double, c Double codepre  pandp  precodedef myFuncpar Parameters, ctx Context Unit     ..do stuff   for ilt 1 to ITERATIONS       otherFunctions.resolvepar, ctx  object otherFunctions     def resolveparams Parameters, ctx Context Unit         do more ...       val x Int  ...       calculateparams.values, ctx.a, ctx.b, x        def calculatearray Array[Double], b Double, c Double, x Int  ...      codepre  pIn this case when codemyFunccode is called on instances of codeParameterscode and codeContextcode, since the default is callbyvalue, scala evaluates the parameters first. my confusion is whether evaluated in this sense is the copying of objects, or just the pointers. that would clearly effect whether or not I pull parameters out before the for expression.    p

Negative 555 pThis question follows from these two topicsp  pa hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions274763272dbinneddatawithcountsaslabelsinggplot22d binned data with counts as labels in ggplot2ap  pa hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions26177134howtoshowthenumericcellvaluesinheatmapcellsinrHow to show the numeric cell values in heat map cells in rap  pIn the first topic, a user wants to use statbin2d to generate a heatmap, and then wants the count of each bin written on top of the heat map. The method the user initially wants to use doesnt work, the best answer stating that  statbin2d is designed to work with geom  rect rather than text. No satisfactory response is given.p  pThe second question is almost identical to the first, with one crucial difference, that the variables in the second question question are text, not numeric. The answer produces the desired result, placing the count value for a bin over the bin in a stat2d heat map.p  pTo compare the two methods ive prepared the following codep  precode    libraryggplot2     data lt data.framex  rnorm1000, y  rnorm1000     ggplotdata, aesx  x, y  y       geombin2d         statbin2dgeomtext, aeslabel..count.. codepre  pWe know this first gives you the errorp  pError geomtext requires the following missing aesthetics x, y.p  pSame issue as in the first question. Interestingly, changing from statbin2d to statbinhex works finep  precode    libraryggplot2     data lt data.framex  rnorm1000, y  rnorm1000     ggplotdata, aesx  x, y  y       geombinhex         statbinhexgeomtext, aeslabel..count.. codepre  pWhich is great and all, but generally, I dont think hex binning is very clear, and for my purposes wont work for the data im trying to desribe. I really want to use stat2d.p  pTo get this to work, ive prepared the following work around based on the second answerp  precode    libraryggplot2     data lt data.framex  rnorm1000, y  rnorm1000     xtltas.characterrounddatax,.1     ytltas.characterrounddatay,.1     xxltas.characterseq3,3,1     yyltas.characterseq3,3,1     dataltcbinddata,xt,yt        ggplotdata, aesx  xt, y  yt        geombin2d         statbin2dgeomtext, aeslabel..count..       scalexdiscretelimits xx        scaleydiscretelimitsyy  codepre  pThis works around allows one to bin numerical data, but to do so, you have to determine bin width I did it via rounding before bringing it into ggplot. I actually figured it out while writing this question, so I may as well finish. This is the result turns out I cant post imagesp  pSo my real question here, is does any one have a better way to do this Im happy I at least got it to work, but so far I havent seen an answer for putting labels on stat2d bins when using a numerical variable.p  pDoes any one have a method for passing on x and y arguments to geomtext from stat2dbin without having to use a work around Can any one explain why it works with text variables but not with numbers p

Ive been unable to avoid it wo removing the splash.p  pWe cant revert to 1.6 because there are no redistributable 1.6 jres for OSX.

Negative 555 pIn chrome it works perfectly fine. But in firefox I have a text field that is editable when the user clicks on the field it always puts the cursor to the front of the text. Also does not allow a user to use the arrow keys to move around the text area or even use the delete key to delete the placeholder text. Does anyone know of this issue in firefox and a  way to fix itp  pThanksp
Negative 555 pI have hurriedly written this class which takes for initialization the textual representation of graph as a string and constructs a graph object.p  pThe first line header describes the type of the graph and the number of vertices. It has two or three parts. The first part is either the character D indicating a directed graph, or the character U indicating an undirected graph. p  pIf the graph is weighted, the second part of the header is the character W. p  pThe last part of the header is a natural number n indicating the number of vertices in the graph. All the vertices in the graph are numbered from 0 to n1.p  pIf the graph string has more than one line, each remaining line starting from the second line, describes an edge. The first two parts of an edge are two natural numbers between 0 and n1, describing an edge between the two vertices identified with these numbers. p  pIf the graph is directed, the two numbers must be interpreted as an ordered pair describing an edge from the first vertex to the second vertex. If the graph is undirected, the two numbers must be interpreted as an unordered pair describing an edge between the two vertices. p  pIf the graph is weighted there will be a third part which will be an integer indicating the weight of the edge.p  pThe graphs can be both directed or undirected, and weighted or nonweighted For example this graphp  precodegraphstring   D W 3 0 1 7 1 0 2 0 2 0  printGraphgraphstring.adjacencylist  codepre  pis directed and weighted, and the 3 next to these symbolize the number of edges in this case 3.

Negative 555 pIm having an incredibly difficult time styling Twitter Typeaheads search bar. Adding the Typeahead javascript seems to add three new classes to my search bar, code.twittertypeaheadcode, code.tthintcode, and code.ttinputcode, which each behave in different, bizarre ways.p  pFirst, the background of the search bar was set to transparent after I added Typeahead, even though I had set it to white with a different class, so I had to add a white background wrapper, which contains all three new classes. Giving code.typeaheadcode codewidth 100 height100 borderradius 20pxcodefits it to the borderradius and height of the wrapper, but its about 50px shorter than the wrapper. code.ttinputcode fits the height and width perfectly, but its apparently what is making the background transparent, because the about 50px of discrepancy between code.ttinputcode and code.twittertypeaheadcode is the color of the background, not the white wrapper. Finally, code.tthintcode obeys only the color. Its white, but it doesnt respond when I try to set the borderradius, height, or width.p  pIf explicitly setting the attributes of these classes doesnt appear to work to style them, I have to conclude that there are other classes in play that I cant find. That, or theres a bug in Typeaheads code.p  pHas anyone run into anything like this Does anyone know why the three classes might not be responding to the css Im at my wits end.p
Negative 555 pGood day everyone. Is it possible to change the build variant at run time in android studio some howp  pI have two server environments. One for debug build type and another for release. The code itself relies on some strings and server addresses that are set when I pick my build variant. So when I pick debug for instance, the string uses out debug server address. The same for release. But what if I want to be able to pick the environment during run time I wouldnt want to add both server urls to both build types just so I could be able to pick a different environment. This defeats the purpose of the build variant I believe. p  pSo I was wondering if there is a way to change the build variant at run time, letting the gradle system sort things outp  pThank youp

Negative 555 pI have two projects in my VS 2010 solution. One of them is a Windows service which has an installer class and the other one is a Windows application. Windows service just checks if Windows application is running or not. They dont have reference for each other.p  pI created an Installer Project and added outputs of both Project to all custom actions Install, Commit, Rollback and Uninstall.p  pAfter building all projects, I install the application via MSI. All files are located in CProgram FilesProductName folder after installation. Also there is a file with name ApplicationName.InstallState.p  pNo problem till here but if I want to uninstall the application via Add Remove Programs it gives the error which I stated in the title and rollbacks all files. But after Rolling back ApplicationName.InstallState disappears.p  pI searched a solution for that and tried various ways but no luck.p  pThe weird thing is that if I copy and paste the MSI package into the application folder, I can successfully uninstall the application. After uninstalling the application I find two files in the application folder MSI package and ApplicationName.InstallState file which has a complex xml information inside.p  pIs it something about Windows service It has an installer.cs so maybe it is a problemp  pThank youp

Negative 555 pWe have a network of four brokers, 2 frontend and 2 backend Ill refer to them as FB1 FB2 BB1 BB2. They are networked in a square like sop  precodeFB1 ....

Simple chat bot looklike IRCp  precodeimport asyncio   class ChatBot     def initself, loop         conn  asyncio.openconnectionHOST, PORT, looploop         self.reader, self.writer  yield from conn      def sendself, msg         self.writer.writemsg      def readself         msg  yield from self.reader.readline         return msg      def runself         while True             msg  self.read             self.parsemsg      def parseself, msg         if msg.startswithPING             self.someworkmsg         elif msg.startswithERROR             self.someerror         else             self.serverlogmsg      def someworkself, msg          some work. It can call asynchronous function like IO or long operation. It can use self.send.      def someerrorself, msg          some work. It can call asynchronous function like IO or long operation. It can use self.send.      def serverlogself, msg          some work. It can call asynchronous function like IO or long operation. It can use self.send.   loop  asyncio.geteventloop bot  ChatBotloop loop.rununtilcomplete loop.close codepre  pI think codecode is codebot.runcode and codeChatBot.runcode must be decorated with codeasyncio.coroutinecode. Then, how about other methods I cant understand when use codeasyncio.coroutinecode decorator and call method with codeyield fromcode or codeasyncio.asynccode. I already read PEP3156 for understanding asnycio. But I cant understand fully.p

Negative 555 pIm creating an app using Ember.js. This application allows to book an appointment at the doctor.p  pYou have a booking process with a few steps.p  pAfter step 1 bookingstart, you have a screen that shows up if the user isnt connected bookinguser. On this page, I have two links one to the login page, another one to the registration page.

When I log in, everything works fine, Im connected and redirected to bookingconfirmation.p  pBUT, I lose all the data from my booking controller. Its obvious, since login doesnt have any connection with my booking controller.p  pI believe this is not a pure Ember Simple Auth question, but more a general Ember.js question. Do you have any idea about how I should change the login behavior to keep the data or change the logic of the app to save the data before going to the login page, then retrieve it on bookingconfirmationp  pMy code is available here a hrefhttpsgithub.comlionelrudazwellnowfrontend relnofollowhttpsgithub.comlionelrudazwellnowfrontendap  pLet me know if you need more information.p

It is represented currently as a number110, but I need the description that goes with the number, which is in a different table in the database.br The number that was originally displayed before switching it to a combobox was noneligibilityreason.

Negative 555 pIt is pretty apparent that most of us PHP programmers dont want our published work to be hacked or exploited in ways we did not intend. I am therefore extra careful when asking about ways to counter session hijacking. I know there is the sessionregenerateid function to partly counter session hijacking but I was more curious about another method I came acrossp  pAs a user logs in to the website you take their userid or another even more secret, predefined encrypted string which is unknown for common users as a string and you salt it with random predefined symbols, md5 the string and set it as a SESSION[usercode]  thatstring and anytime this user goes to a page you salt repeat the procedure and match it with SESSION[usercode], if they do not match destroy the session.p  pSo in code it would look something like this for examplep  precode user credentials are correct, user data is fetched from db     SESSION[username]  row[3] username SESSION[password]  row[2] password SESSION[userid]  row[4] userid salt1  uNs819 salt2  J2i usercode  salt1 . row[4] . salt2 usercode  md5usercode SESSION[usercode]  usercode codepre  pAnd then you check if this is correct in the beginning of every available page withp  precodefetch user credentials from db again row4 is the userid ifSESSION[usercode]  md5salt1 . row[4] . salt2     sessiondestroy  codepre  pI do not think using the userid as part of the encryption is optimal but it is only an example. Preferably I will use an md5 string of the timestamp of when the user was created. But if I was being unclear my main question is that is this method solid against session hijacking, whywhy notp

This is because function declarations are not part of   the regular toptobottom flow of control. They are conceptually moved   to the top of their scope and can be used by all the code in that   scope. This is sometimes useful because it gives us the freedom to   order code in a way that seems meaningful, without worrying about   having to define all functions above their first use.p blockquote

I understand that I cannot do this as Steps are global. What I wanted to ask is whats the best way i.e. best practise to achieve this without duplicating the same steps in every step definition. p  pThanksp
