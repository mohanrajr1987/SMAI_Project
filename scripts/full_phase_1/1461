Positive 1461 pI am currently working on a iOS game using SpriteKit and ObjectiveC. Ive recently been trying to optimize my draw calls, but Ive run into an issue where I am either misunderstand the batch draw operation andor I am receiving some unexpected results. Additionally I have read the Apple documentation regarding batch drawing, Im just afraid I may have misinterpreted some of the guidelines. p  pSo here is the rundown assume that all atlases are preloaded and that self is a SKScenep  pThis works as you would expect. The first touch adds 1 to both the node and draw count. Subsequent touches add to the node count but not the draw count. p  precodeCode Block 1 voidtouchesBeganNSSet touches withEventUIEvent event   [super touchesBegantouches withEventevent]  UITouch touch  [touches anyObject] CGPoint location  [touch locationInNodeself] SKNode node  [self nodeAtPointlocation]  SKSpriteNode touch1  [SKSpriteNode spriteNodeWithTexture[[SKTextureAtlas atlasNamedTouchAtlas1] textureNamedtexture1]] [touch1 setPositionlocation] [self addChildenemyTouch]  codepre  pWhen I start adding two sprites from different atlases to the parent I start to get too many draw calls. What I expected on the first touch I would get 2 nodes and 2 draw calls and subsequent touches produce 2 nodes and 0 draw calls. What I got on the first touch I got 2 nodes and 2 draw calls and subsequent touches produced 2 nodes and 2 draw calls. p  precodeCode Block 2 voidtouchesBeganNSSet touches withEventUIEvent event   [super touchesBegantouches withEventevent]  UITouch touch  [touches anyObject] CGPoint location  [touch locationInNodeself] SKNode node  [self nodeAtPointlocation]  SKSpriteNode touch1  [SKSpriteNode spriteNodeWithTexture[[SKTextureAtlas atlasNamedTouchAtlas1] textureNamedtexture1]] [touch1 setPositionlocation] [self addChildtouch1]  SKSpriteNode touch2  [SKSpriteNode spriteNodeWithTexture[[SKTextureAtlas atlasNamedTouchAtlas2] textureNamedtexture2]] [touch2 setPositionlocation] [self addChildtouch2]  codepre  pI tried one additional step of adding a child SKNode extraLayer to the scene and adding one sprite to the scene and one sprite to the extraLayer. This produced the desired results of 2 nodes and 0 draw calls I wanted above. p  precodeCode Block 3 voidtouchesBeganNSSet touches withEventUIEvent event   [super touchesBegantouches withEventevent]  UITouch touch  [touches anyObject] CGPoint location  [touch locationInNodeself] SKNode node  [self nodeAtPointlocation]  SKSpriteNode touch1  [SKSpriteNode spriteNodeWithTexture[[SKTextureAtlas atlasNamedTouchAtlas1] textureNamedtexture1]] [touch1 setPositionlocation] [self addChildtouch1]  SKSpriteNode touch2  [SKSpriteNode spriteNodeWithTexture[[SKTextureAtlas atlasNamedTouchAtlas2] textureNamedtexture2]] [touch2 setPositionlocation] [self.extraLayer addChildtouch2]  codepre  pstrongThe questionstrong Is this in fact the way batching draw calls needs to be handled All sprites whose textures come from common atlases need to be children of the same parent, but additionally that parent has no children whos textures come from a different atlas Or is there a way of making the method of block 2 batch correctlyp

Positive 1461 pOur library a hrefhttpapinatomy.orghome relnofollowApiNATOMYa renders a treemap to navigate a hierarchical space like human anatomy, for instance. We used to use nested codeltdivgtcode elements for every tile, but the reflow process was a constant source of slowdown. Weve now switched to pure WebGL Three.js, and got a remarkable performance boost.p  pHowever, this did lose us the convenience of HTMLlike markup. It now requires 1020 lines of code to draw a box, and another 1020 to render some text. Having things stay centered when the box is resized is also a manual job, and I dont even dare dream of automatic linebreaks. Then theres the problem of codeTHREE.FontUtilscode being an incredibly slow way to render text. Ive found a way to do it with a a hrefhttpstemkoski.github.ioThree.jsTextureFromCanvas.html relnofollowseparate canvasa, but that also requires a lot of manual code, and is more inflexible w.r.t. sizing.p  pSo my question is Is there some library of utility classesfunctions to make these sorts of 2D jobs in Three.js easier and more robust Alternatively, any general tips or referencesp  pNote There will still be 3D aspects to ApiNATOMY, so a pure 2D renderer is not an option.p

Positive 1461 pI have a form that contains a picture box.  In the codebehind, I draw some things in this picture box.  The size of these drawings depend on the size of the picture box for example, a circle whose width is 90 of the boxs width.  When the form loads, it is in normal state, and it looks fine.  I can maximize the form, and when I do the controls size accordingly and the drawings in the picture box also size accordingly  so that all looks good.  The issue is when I then restore the form back to a normal state  the controls resize accordingly, but the drawings in the picture box do not therefore some of it is cut off because its too large.  I tried using the Me.Resize event to call the logic that makes the drawings, but for some reason when that is called it still thinks the width of the picture box is the width when in the maximized state.p  pSo why do the graphics in the picture box resize fine when you maximize the form, but not when you restore it to normalp  pAnd why would it still think the boxs width is that while maximized, not actually the width when normal which is the state its now inp  pIs there a way to get around this so I can make sure the graphics will resize correctlyp  pNote  I would try using the ResizeEnd event instead, but that is not raised when you maximize or restore the form.  I dont know why that is, either.p

This view contains 2 type of headers on top and on left side and I have items which can be different sizes. When I add all this items to view I add items first after that I add headers, in this case headers will be always drawn in front of items. And when user scroll lefttop, items will be go to lefttop side, but header will stay on their position and this item will be under the headers. When I had background for headers, it was ok, because user didnt see items under headers, but now I dont have background and user sees items under the headers.

Positive 1461 pIm trying to understand different drawing methods in Swift and why they perform as they do.p  pThe below code draws smooth lines using a codeUIBezierPathcode, project available from a hrefhttpsgithub.comlimhoweLimSignatureView relnofollowhttpsgithub.comlimhoweLimSignatureViewap  pInitially the performance of the code below is highly responsive when the user begins touching the screen. However, over time, the longer the duration of touching and moving on the screen, the performance begins to lag and the drawing displayed doesnt keep up and isnt accurate some points appear to be missed. The performance only returns to being highly responsive once touching the screen ends and touching the screen begins again for a new drawing.p  hr  pThings Ive noticedp  ul lipWhen codeself.setNeedsDisplaycode is commented out in codeoverride func touchesMovedcode, there is no drawing displayed during touching the screen, but once lifting the finger triggering codeoverride func touchesEndedcode, the final result is a perfect drawing, with no lagging or inaccurate drawing points no matter how long the duration. This is the result ideally wanted and displayed while drawing.pli lipWhen codebeizerPath.removeAllPointscode is commented out in codeoverride func touchesEndedcode lagging continues to occur even after the user lifts their finger and starts touching the screen again.pli lipIt seems that codebeizerPath.removeAllPointscode might reset the lagging, while codeself.setNeedsDisplaycode might be causing lagging over time.pli lipWhen increasing codebeizerPath.lineWidthcode to from 2 to a larger width e.g. 50 or 100, the drawing tends to lag slightly.pli ul  hr  pHmmm. Im confused as to why this is all is as it is.p  ul lipWhat exactly is going on here with the lagging over timepli lipWhat is the relationship between codebeizerPath.removeAllPointscode and codeself.setNeedsDisplaycode and the lagging pli lipWhy does increasing codebeizerPath.lineWidthcode cause some minor laggingpli lipWhat might else be causing laggingpli lipCould removing some of the points while drawing improve performance, and if so, how can that be acheivedpli lipWhat needs to be modified in the below code to ensure that perfect drawing continues overtime with no laggingpli ul  pAppreciate any enlightened feedback and improvements to the code.

Negative 1461 pOne of the biggest issues currently holding me back from diving full steam into unit testing is that a really large percentage of the code I write is heavily dependent on thirdparty COM objects from different sources that also tend to interact with each other Im writing addins for Microsoft Office using several helper libraries if you need to know.p  pI know I should probably use mock objects but how exactly would I go about that in this case I can see that its relatively easy when I just have to pass a reference to an already existing object but some of my routines instantiate external COM objects themselves and then sometimes pass them on to some other external COMobject from yet a  different library.p  pWhat is the bestpractice approach here Should I have my testing code temporarily change the COM registration information in the registry so the tested code will instantiate one of my mock objects instead Should I inject modified type library units What other approaches are therep  pI would be especially grateful for examples or tools for Delphi but would be just as happy with more general advice and higherlevel explanations just as well.p  pThanks,p  pOliverp

Negative 1461 pI have to solve the following problem in an optimal way.p  pInput data isp  ul liN points in a plane given as a x, y pair of integer coordinatesli liM points in the same plane given as a x, y pair of integer coordinates representing the center of a circle. All this circles have 0, 0 on their edge.li ul  pI need to find a way of isolating a number of circles that have the property than for any good circle no point from the first N points lays in the chosen circle or at the edge of the chosen circle.p  pThe number of points and circles is in the order of 100,000. The obvious solution of checking every circle with every point has the complexity ON  M and with 100,000 circles and 100,000 points it takes about 15 seconds on a Core 2 Duo with 64 bit SSE3 single precision code. The reference implementation I compete against takes only about 0.1 seconds with the same data. I know the reference implementation is ONlog N  Mlog M.p  pI have thought of optimizing my algorithm in the following way. Make 2 copies of the point data and sort the copies in respect to x coordinate, respectively the y coordinate. Then use only points that lay in the square defined by [xc  r, yc  r xc  r, yc  r], where xc, yc is the center of the current circle, with radius r. I can find points in that interval using binary search because now I work with sorted data. The complexity of this approach should be ONlog N  Mlog2 N, and indeed it is faster but still significantly slower than the reference.p  pI know more or less how the reference implementation works, but there are some steps that I dont understand. I will try to explain what I know so farp  pThe radius of a circle with coordinates Xc, Yc isp  ul liRc  sqrtXc  Xc  Yc  Yc 1li ul  pThats because 0, 0 is on the edge of a circle.p  pFor a point Px, y to be outside of a circle, the following inegality must be truep  ul lisqrtXc  x2  Yc  y2  Rc 2li ul  pNow if we substitute Rc from 1 into 2, then square the inegality after we make some simple calculations we getp  ul liYc lt 12y  x2  y2  Xc  xy 3.1 for y  0 li liYc  12y  x2  y2  Xc  xy 3.2 for y lt 0li ul  p3.1 and 3.2 must be true for a given circle CXc, Yc for any x, y chosen from the input data.p  pFor simplicity, lets make a few notationsp  ul liAx, y  12y  x2  y2 4.1li liBx, y  xy 4.2li liEXc  12y  x2  y2  Xc  xy  Ax, y  Xc  Bx, y 4.3li ul  pWe can see that for a given circle CXc, Yc, we can write 3 asp  ul liYc lt MINEXc 5.1 for all points with y  0li liYc  MAXEXc 5.2 for all points with y lt 0li ul  pWe can see that EXc is a linear function in respect to Xc with 2 paramaters  Ax, y and Bx, y. That means that basically EXc represents in the Euclidean space a family of lines with 2 parameters.p  pNow here comes the part I dont understand. They say that because of the property stated in the above paragraph we can calculate MIN and MAX in O1 amortized time instead of ON time using an Envelope algorithm. I dont know how the Envelope algorithm might work.p  pAny hints on how to implement the Envelope algorithmp  pThanks in advancep  phr p  pstrongEditstrongp  pThe question is not about what an envelope in the mathematical sense is  I already know that. The question is how to determine the envelope in better time then On, apparently it could be done in amortized O1.p  pI have the family of functions I need to calculate the envelope, and I have an array of all posible parameters.

Negative 1461 pIm in the design stage for an app which will utilize a REST web service and sort of have a dilemma in as far as using asynchronous vs synchronous vs threading. Heres the scenario.p  pSay you have three options to drill down into, each one having its own RESTbased resource. I can either lazily load each one with a synchronous request, but thatll block the UI and prevent the user from hitting a back navigation button while data is retrieved. This case applies almost anywhere emexceptem for when your application requires a login screen. I cant see any reason to use synchronous HTTP requests vs asynchronous because of that reason alone. The only time it makes sense is to have a worker thread make your synchronous request, and notify the main thread when the request is done. This will prevent the block. The question then is bench marking your code and seeing which has more overhead, a threaded synchronous request or an asynchronous request.p  pThe problem with asynchronous requests is you need to either setup a smart notification or delegate system as you can have multiple requests for multiple resources happening at any given time. The other problem with them is if I have a class, say a singleton which is handling all of my data, I cant use asynchronous requests in a getter method. Meaning the following wont gop  precode  NSArray users       ifusers  nil         users  doasyncrequest  NO GOOD       return users   codepre  pwhereas the followingp  precode  NSArray users      ifusers  nil       users  dosyncrequest  OK.      return users   codepre  pYou also might have priority. What I mean by priority is if you look at Apples Mail application on the iPhone, youll notice they first suck down your entire POPIMAP tree before making a second request to retrieve the first 2 lines the default of your message.p  pI suppose my question to you experts is this. When are you using asynchronous, synchronous, threads  and when are you using either asyncsync in a thread What kind of delegation system do you have setup to know what to do when a async request completes Are you prioritizing your async requestsp  pTheres a gamut of solutions to this all too common problem. Its simple to hack something out. The problem is, I dont want to hack and I want to have something thats simple and easy to maintain.p

Negative 1461 pSo I am in a situation where I have to decide whether or not to have a separate controller for a particular piece of code. We have a home page that acts like a hub for the rest of the site. The page is accessible to all users logged in as well as nonloggedin. I was thinking about having codehomecode as a separate controller and an action called codeindexcode. Thinking about this situation, I started wondering if there are any rules or guidelines on this front.p  pMy perception has been that if a code revolves around an entity, separation is needed. Similar to REST guidelines If the entity is a noun, it should be a controller. If the entity is a verb, it should probably be an action and should reside in the controller whose name is the same as that of the noun that the verb refers to. Some colleagues suggested that since this is one action, it should reside in the some existing controller and should be named codehomecode. I strongly disagreed, however, I could not find a trusted source that would back me up on this.p  pWould like to know your thoughts.p
Negative 1461 pI have a rather enormous project in which Im trying to retrofit inmemory data. Essentially, I have a big collection of objects which contain primitives and other objects which exist in hibernate. Large sections of nondao code rely on lazyloading through hibernate to hydrate objects on the fly. However, since everything exists in memory, my object are not loaded, and I get hibernate lazy loading exceptions.p  pI could just manually implement hibernate lazy loading by dipping to hibernate and hydrating the hibernate object manually, but the object graph for that object is huge, containing hundreds of types that would need to be initialized and set. This seems impractical, and Im looking for a viable solution to this problem.

Negative 1461 pSummarized Questionbr  In the WPF TreeView, how can I force the selected event on an item that is currently the selected itemp  pDetailed Infobr  I am trying to add functionality to my WPF TreeView by adding multiselect using shiftfor a range and controlfor toggling selection of an item. Ive implemented my own SelectedItems collection since the TreeView only has a selected item. I still use the SelectedItem of the TreeView so that it does not break keyboard functionality, however I do overwrite the existing ItemContainerStyle so that even though an item is selected, it does not give the appearance that it is selected. I wouldnt have needed to do this however, I needed to only highlight the background of the textblock of my selected treeview items, rather than the entire width of the item, so I handle the foreground and background color changes on my own.p

I emonlyem want the highest score and the evalue for the alignment to be output.  The idea is that once I have this working, I can wrap this in my own control program and automatically run it many times with different query sequences and log the scores and evalues.p  pI know this is a long shot, but does anybody have an idea on how I can go about doing this The two hurdles for me are using my own database file and customizing the output.p

Negative 1461 pI have two tables, strongusersstrong and stronggroupsstrong. A user can belong to many groups. A group can have many users.p  pSo I have created a stronghaveandbelongstomanystrong relationship between users and groups using a join table, groupsusers. This all works as expected.p  pWhat I would also like to do is specify an ACTIVE group for each user.

Is that the caseli liIf so, how would you implement these relationships Right now Im just manually using the groupid, but that feels messy. li liRegardless of whether I am using Active Record magic or manually setting the active group, it is possible for a users active group to be outside the groups they belong to using the first habtm relationship.

Negative 1461 pApples recommended method for multithreading core data is to use a managed object context per thread, and to send changes from one context to another by saving the changed threads context to a shared persistent store.p  pWhile I can imagine that being fine for, eg. an RSS reader, for some applications it seems far from ideal. In my case, Im writing a music sequencer that records amp plays data using a background thread. I need recorded data to be accessible to the main thread during recordplayback. Having to constantly save and load data while recordingplaying would be bad enough, but worse, itd seem to force the user to save whenever they record or play, which kinda screams terrible application.p  pHowever, it seems that there might be a way of sidestepping this. If other threads dont need access to the core data entities themselves just the data they contain, whats to stop me from running the managed object context in its own thread, and only allowing other threads indirect access, for example by binding UI objects to a property that calls codeperformSelectoronThreadwithObjectwaitUntilDonecode on the managed object contexts thread to getset valuesp  pIt doesnt give some of the benefits of multithreading i.e. scaling core data to multicore CPUs, but a lot of the time, we just want multithreading to avoid locking up the UI while something intensive is happening.p  pIve not seen this pattern advocated for core data. Given that it can be a strange and unpredictable beast when you dont do exactly what apple suggests, I thought itd be worth asking if this really does avoid the reasons were discouraged from letting multiple threads access a single managed object context.p

So, my questions arep  ol liDoes it happen in your case as well if not, its probably some bug in my CSSli liIf so, has the FF team decided to go against the W3C and change the default boxmodelli liIf so, do you happen to know why and where I can find some info about it Google refused to helpli ol

Negative 1461 pIm implementing the a hrefhttpdevelopers.facebook.comdocsreferencepluginslikeFacebook Like Buttona, but Im running into some trouble with the width. Im using the JavaScript SDK implementation, not the direct iframe.p  pAccording to the documentation, the default width is code450code. Thats fine, and I understand that the width can be changed by way of the codewidthcode attribute on the codeltfblikegtcode tag. However, my problem is that I really cannot specify a fixed width. Due to the nature of the button, the width is not constant in all states. For example, if no one has liked the page yet it displays Be the first of your friends to like this if someone has, it displays XXX people like this. Be the first of your friends and still if emyouem have liked it, it displays You like this emorem You and XXX people like this. In other words, there are many states of the button, none of which share a constant width.p  pThis wouldnt be much of a problem if it werent for the fact that I want to display the button floated on the righthand side of a codeltdivgtcode.

Negative 1461 pIve been working on this problem for two days now. Im working on an iPhone app that, at the moment, has  dual layer view see picture.  The semitransparent orange panel covering the left third of the screen was created by simply resizing the subview in IB to take up less than half the screen so that, when that view loads, the original view is still exposed on the right.  This would allow the left view to be a menu view allowing a user to select what he or she would like to appear in the main view window which is actually a codeUIWebViewcode...see screen shot.p  pa hrefhttplcdapps.comwpcontentuploads201102webview2.png relnofollow Click Here For Screen Shotap  pIf Im going to keep this setup assuming its not a structural sin, the leftview clearly needs a way to communicate with the main view.  Can I invoke methods in the mainwiew .m file WebViewController.m like codeviewDidLoadcode and others from the ETG button on the orange subview  Or is this just a really bad idea  And if this isnt a bad idea or a sin against iPhone structure, how would you implement it Ill thank you in advance for any helpful thoughts or suggestions you might have.

Negative 1461 pI have a web application which has the same banner on every page with links etc. What I want to know, when one of these links is clicked, should I simply use javascriptjquery as follows to render a partial view of the content into a div... or just do a regular Html.ActionLink where the target page contains the bannerp  ppage structurep  precodeltdiv id bannergt  banner content ltdivgt ltdiv idmainContentDivgt  changing content ltdivgt codepre  pSo when I select a link in my banner where the banner doesnt change, should I call some jquery function to change the content...p  precodemainContentDiv.loadControllerNameActionNameargs... codepre  p... which would call some controller action and return a partial view in my main content div. Is this good practice It means I am only loading content needed and not having to reload my banner. Ive played around with trying to return partial views using json also but it seems overcomplicated for what I am doing. So my question is... is this the right way to carry out this operation or are there any disadvantages doing thisp  pIts just at the minute I have everything as Html.ActionLink, so its probably more a question of, is it worth a refactor to keep the static content not requiring the refresh... it would mean the user cant see where each link is taking them as it would all be javascript onclick events, and I would have to change all my action methods to return partial views as well as removing the banner from my my current views and making them partial views...p

Negative 1461 pWere developing an accounting and ERP application something that lots of companies, big and small, use to run their businesses, and I was pondering about the possibility to interconnect two unrelated instances of the application. For example, if company A would write a bill company B, and they both happened to use our application, the bill would get sent automatically to the application instance that the company B is using. Saves time and errors of duplicate data entry.p  pOf course, bills are just one, the most obvious example. Im sure there are many more.p  pNaturally, such a brilliant idea cannot be mine alone so I was wondering what other applications are using for such purposes, and if there are any industry standards out there. Having our application able to connect to other vendors products with 0 additional work would be awesome.p  pI came across a hrefhttpwww.ofx.net relnofollowOFXa, but comments here on SO give me the impression that its more suited to banking industry, and not small scale applications, although it is supposed to be extensible.

It does not even attempt to query each of the model items in the root, so what I get is a row for each model object, but the ones that are meant to be expandable are not. p  pAs a point of interest, I implemented a delegate method which draws expandable rows differently, and that is working just fine. However, something in this implementation is causing the datasource to not ask each item if it has children, and thus I cannot expand those items that are meant to be expanded. I dont know why though I have followed the Apple docs and a bunch of online resources but keep coming to this same problem. Any advice would be well appreciated.

Negative 1461 pAfter downloading and using Xuggler, my initial impressions are very good it supports a whole host of codecs, it was relatively hassle free to get going and the getting started tutorial videos explained all the necessary concepts very clearly.p  pHowever, after playing around with it for a couple of days Im really tearing my hair out over getting all the audio and video to sync up nicely. Its fine when playing normally but when adding pausing, seeking and accounting for occasional 6 second pauses while my external hard drive spins up it becomes an absolute nightmare.p  pIve partly implemented something already but its nowhere near perfect  you can seek around a few times but after a while it still drifts off.p  pI cant help thinking this is a common use case of Xuggler and someone must have done this sort of thing already much better than I have. But alas, I cant find any examples beyond the ones on the website. Is there a higher level API around that manages all the audio  video sync issues and just provides some higher level controls play, pause, stop etc. Ive no problem going down the route of doing it myself if theres nothing out there already, but Ive never been a fan of reinventing the wheel especially if my new wheel is in all likelihood worse than the old onep

Negative 1461 pI have some java components that sometimes die and the only way I know is when a user compains theyve gotten an error.  p  pWhat Ive done on our monitoring systems is count the amount of java processes running on the server.

It works, but I think it could be refined to which component died and be able to start the java process remotely.p  pSo what I was thinking is writing a Powershell script that is executed from the monitoring system.  I think I have most of the one liner but need a little more help getting me to the finish line, as I think this script doesnt need to be elaborate.p  pWhat I have so far isp  precodetheProcess  GetWmiObject win32process Filter name like java  select commandLine codepre  pThe output of this command gives me all the parameters sent to the JVM, including the name of the component, lets call the component COMPNumber1, and usually there are 5 java component processes running, so the name of the components are COMPNumber2, COMPNumber3, and so on.  p  pMy question is  Given the output of theProcess, how do I check all the java processes to validate that all of the components are running And if not, which one is not runningp  pMuch Appreciatedp  pTTp

Negative 1461 pI have been thinkingresearching the best way to handle my entity dates in conjunction with an ORM tool.  Currently I am using Doctrine2php 5.3 with a MySQL driverif anyone needs to know. p  pSo my situation is as follows  I have a system that tracks WorkOrders and their Invoices from collaborating subcontractors.  So a WorkOrder may have numerous invoices submitted by samedifferent subcontractors which will aggregate for a given pay period. This amount, is paid to the subcontractor. My question is what is the best way to handle fetching invoices that fall into a specific pay period or any date range for that matter As an example I have a table which displays the totals for each subcontractor for each week in a year, but I also display totals for a month etc..  In addition I have a calendar view which displays the same invoices aggregated by day and week.p  pCurrently I pass a date rangefromDatethruDate along with a class which is configured to iterate the result set and compose collections based on different criteria such as unit of time to aggregate results and a calculator to handle the totaling of the invoices based on user role andor invoice type.  This way seems to be very flexible so far, however I am concerned with the performance impact of fetching say 10,000 invoices, having doctrine hydrate the objects, me iterating the result set, and then iterating again in my view to display.  I am thinking I could eliminate one step of me iterating the result step by looking into a custom hydrator.  p  pI have also been thinking about setting up a entity with each date from the date of origin of the system to a relevant currentfuture date with relationships to weeksmonthsquartersyears which would save me the hassle of forming my own collections from the result set.  This method seems like it would be nice especially since when I pass a date range to fetch invoices to display on a calendar, I have to find and pass fromDates and thruDate which more often than not extend into previous and future months because of how the weeks are totaled.  I am beginning to lean more toward this approach but I have a feeling when I begin to implement it that I will begin to run into problems.p  pSo enough rambling on for now, Ill just ask.  Can anyone give me any pointerstipslessons learned reading material etc... on this subject.p  pThanks for your time.p

Negative 1461 pBy my understanding, when an object is sent an codeautoreleasecode message, if no autorelease pools exist other than the one in codemain.mcode, the object gets placed in the one in codemain.mcode. Assuming this is correct, I have a couple of questionsp  p1 Do all autoreleased objects stay in that pool until the termination of the app p  p2 If 1 is true, does creating an autoreleased object without a local autorelease pool therefore placing that object in the codemain.mcode pool keep that object in memory until termination of the app or a memory warning is received p  p3 When is the codemain.mcode autorelease pool drained, other than when the app receives a memory warning or the application is terminatedp  pFor example, in a cellForRowAtIndexPath delegate method such as thisp  precodeUITableViewCell cell  [tableView dequeueReusableCellWithIdentifierFoobar] if cell  nil       No cell to reuse gt create a new one     cell  [[[UITableViewCell alloc] initWithStyleUITableViewCellStyleSubtitle reuseIdentifierFoobar] autorelease]       lots of custom stuff   return cell codepre  pwhen are the cells actually released They have to be autoreleased, because you cant release them before you return them, and you cant release them after, because they are out of scope. By my current understanding, the cells are placed in the topmost autorelease pool, and released when that pool is drainedreleased. In this case, that would be the only autorelease pool in the application the one in codemaincode. p  p4 The problem with this it that even when I am done with those cells and the view controller has been released, the cells stay in memory, yes If this is not the case, could someone provide an explanation of how the memory management in this situation really works Thanksp  pNote I have looked at Apples documentation, but it talks mostly about when to use your own local autorelease pools, but not much about how they actually function.p

Negative 1461 pIm building a custom control which is to have multiple focus points. For example, within 1 control, lets say theres 3 regions could be defined as a rect on the canvas which are to be able to have focus. Depending on which one has focus, I dont want the default Windows dotted line around it, but some special handling. I know nothing about how to even give 1 custom control its own focus.p  pThe original project was a single TPanel with a few VCL controls on it, each of course being its own window, thus having its own focus. But now Im putting it into a custom class of its own, which these 3 controls will no longer exist they were only there in version 1 as a prototype and I need to now somehow mimic the focus in these different regions.p  pI guess similar to something as simple as a TListBox, where certain items within that control get the focus instead of the entire control its self.p  pHeres a picture to help demonstrate what Im making...p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.coml4JWN.png altenter image description herep  pThe one on the top is the original with the buttons. But the one on the bottom is the new one Im building which is all custom drawn.p  pTo elaborate, Id like to see if Windows already has special handling for this type of scenario before I go and reinvent the wheel.p  pIm not looking for the Easiest way to accomplish this. And I also do not want recommendations to revert back to how I had it before, because theres many reasons I dont want 1 control with multiple other controls within. I just need a yes or no, with an explanation.p  pstrongMorestrongp  pI just realized the main concern is the use of the codetabcode key. The control has to first get the focus, start the focus on whichever subitem its supposed to, then respond to codetabcode on my command until it reaches the end, then pass the tabbing over to the next control. Then it also needs shifttab as well. How on earth would I implement this tabbing Thats where I got stuck, but it just struck me that this is the main reason Im asking.p

Negative 1461 pI know this is an ageold question with many an answer, but I havent found any good, robust answers.p  pThe requirement is a textbox that will always contain a string that Double.TryParse will return true on.p  pMost of the implementations I have seen do not guard against input such as 10.45.8. This is a problem.p  pThe preferable way of doing this is entirely with events, such as TextInput and KeyDown for spaces. The problem with these is that it is quite complicated to get a string representing the new Text before it is changed or the old Text after it is changed. The problem with TextChanged is that it doesnt provide a way to get the old Text.p  pIf you could somehow get the new Text before it changes, that would be the most helpful, since you could test it against Double.TryParse. There may be a better solution though.p  pWhat is the best way to do thisp  pThe best answer to this question is one that has several approaches and compares them.p

Negative 1461 pI work on a javascript library that customers include on their site to embed a UI widget.  I want a way to test dev versions of the library live on the customers site without requiring them to make any changes to their code.  This would make it easy to debug issues and test new versions.p  pTo do this I need to change the script include to point to my dev server, and then override the load method thats called in the page to add an extra parameter to tell it what server to point to when making remote calls.p  pIt looks like I can add JS to the page using a chrome extension, but I dont see any way to modify the page before its loaded.  Is there something Im missing, or are chrome extensions not allowed to do this kind of thingp
Negative 1461 pI have been assigned a task at my organization of taking a currently split Access database and publishing it to a Sharepoint server.The database is currently split with the backendTables, data, etc. residing on a network share and the frontendforms, queries, reports, etc. being distributed to endusers. p  pHowever, due to network issues this has become inefficient and we are now exploring Sharepoint and Access services. My original thought process was to convert the backend into webcompatible tables and publish the backend alone to a Sharepoint server. Since the clientobjects created for the frontend are not as easily convertableif at all, I thought I would link the frontend objects to the Sharepoint lists I created by publishing the backend. However, I have had trouble finding any kind of documentation on how to perform this link.p  pHas anyone ever dealt with this before or have any infomration on how I would perform this link, or am I going about this the wrong wayp  pI choose this path because I figured it would be the easiest considering the current databse set up but I have also considered other paths such as combining the frontend and backend or simply creating new web compatible objects.  I just feel like it would be wasteful to simply throw out the current frontend and begin creating all new webcompatible forms, queries and reports.p  pAny help or feedback will be greatly appreciatedp  pThank you.p

Negative 1461 pI have a basic CRUD web app where people can create articlesedit them. I now want to add the ability to keep revision histories of all edits. Currently, I have an Articles table that looks like thisp  precodeArticleid, title, content, authorid, categoryid, format codepre  pI have considered 2 options for changing my current schema to add support for revision history.

No duplicate data stored.p  precodeArticleid, title, categoryid Revisionid, content, authorid, format codepre  p2nd option denormalized Two tables like option 1 but with some duplicate columns.p  precodeArticleid, title, content, authorid, categoryid, format Revisionid, articleid, content, authorid, format codepre  pIm thinking of going with the 2nd option because it will make my coding much easier less complex, less lines of code.

Also, performance should be better since not as many joins will have to be done. p  pIs this a sound way to go about this task Possibly any unforeseen or longterm consequences I am overlookingp

It needs lower level access to system resources but not that low that .NET wouldnt be enough.li liId like to have the three platforms support, but Windows is the primary concern.li liId prefer C and .NET and something equivalent to WPF where the UI is declarative, separated from code in a clean way and allows for rich user interfaces.li ul  pIve heard Silverlight works in Mac already, and support for Linux is possible via Moonlight.p  pstrongShould I consider switching to Silverlight from WPF and what problems may arisestrongp

Negative 1461 pThis may be more of a theoretical question.  I have a scenario wherein there is a compressed file 2 GB that gets decompressed into a larger file 22GB.  This process takes roughly 20 minutes, which in turn means I am wasting about 19 minutes and 59 seconds every time this process gets run.  My question is the following  Is it possible to open up a stream from the file that is being decompressed and pass the information to a separate program that will manipulate the data  Essentially every line in the file is a record, but I have been unable to find a technique to discover when a line has been fully decoded during decompression.  General algorithms or Java libraries are of value.p

Negative 1461 pI have a fullscreen custom Gallery.  Elements of the gallery have buttons and other interactive areas.  Some user interface is done through dialog boxes that pop in front of the gallery when a dialog box is dismissed, the user is taken back to the gallery.p  pMost of the time, this works fine.  However, sometimes, after a dialog box is dismissed, the buttons stop taking user input.  The gallery, on the other hand, still scrolls.  Whats even more bizarre, as soon as I scroll the gallery, the system processes those clicks I thought failed pops up a dialog, etc..p  pIt is easy to say that the main UI thread is locked.  Why is it locked  How do I unlock it  Any help will be appreciated.  Below is the full code of the class.p  pstrongUPDATE.strong  One of the elements within the Gallery is a codeHorizontalScrollViewcode.  When I try scroll it, mouse messages come through I stepped through them and saw that the codescrollBycode and codeinvalidatecode are properly called.  Then I printed out the message queue.  The only event that passes through the main loop is 1006, which I assume is the Touch event.  The Draw event, the 1000, never makes it.  Once I scroll the Gallery back and forth  lo and behold  the message queue starts receiving the 1000s, so the codeHorizontalScrollViewcode scrolls finep  pSo the question becomes what stops the Draw events, and how do I make sure they are sent to the queuep  precodepublic class PlayerGallery extends Gallery     4 buttons to display   private final static int BUTBIRD  0   private final static int

Negative 1461 pPlease see a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions7755661embeddedecllisperrorhandling7755661a first. I am using ECL and basically want to execute some code, trap any kind of condition that may occur and then continue execution, without prompting or entering the debugger. This is easy to achieve with the following handlercase macrop  precodehandlercase   load code.lisp  this may raise a condition    error condition     print condition  this prints sth like lta UNBOUNDVARIABLEgt codepre  pMy only problem is that I cannot find a generic way to print a more meaningful error for the user. Indeed my application is an HTTP server and the output goes to a web page. code.lisp is written by the user and it can raise any kind of condition, I do now want to list them all in my code. I would just like to print the same error message I see on the REPL when I do not use handlercase, but in the HTML page, e.g. for an unbound variable error, a string like The variable VAR is unbound.p  pBy inspecting a condition object of type codeUNBOUNDVARIABLEcode I see it has two slots codeSIREPORTFUNCTIONcode, which is a compiled function and codeSINAMEcode, set to the name of the variable in this case. I guess codeSIREPORTFUNCTIONcode could be what I need to invoke but how can I call it If I tryp  precodehandlercase foo error condition SIREPORTFUNCTION condition codepre  pit tells me that SIREPORTFUNCTION is undefined. SI or SYS in ECL is a package for functions and variables internal to the implementation, but I dont worry if my code is not portable, as long as it works.p  pBTW in other kinds of condition objects there are also other apparently useful slots for my purpose, named codeSIFORMATCONTROLcode and codeSIFORMATARGUMENTcode, but I cannot access any of them from my code too.p  pI was looking for somethink alike to the codegetMessagecode method of Java exception objects in Lisp, but none of my sources ever mentions something like that.p  pMoreover, is there any hope to be able to get the line number in code.lisp where the error occurred too Without that it would be difficult for the user to locate the problem in his code.lisp source file. I would really want to provide this information and stopping at the first error is acceptable for me.p

Negative 1461 pIve written a synchronisation class for the app Im currently working on.p  pBecause of the large amount of data it first gets a data count and then batches up the downloads in an codeNSOperationQueuecode.  This all works fine and Ive got the sync algorithm working quickly.p  pThe way it works is as follows...p  precode voidsynchroniseWithCompletionHandlerblock for completion handler                             errorHandlerblock for error handler      [self.queue addOperationWithBlock                  Create an NSURLRequest for the first batch            Send the request synchronously            Process the result            If error then cancel all operations in the queue, run errorHandler and return.       ]      [self.queue addOperationWithBlock                  Create an NSURLRequest for the second batch            Send the request synchronously            Process the result            If error then cancel all operations in the queue, run errorHandler and return.       ]      Add all the remaining batches.      [self.queue addOperationWithBlock                  completionHandler       ]  codepre  pThis works and keeps the memory usage to a minimum and speed to a maximum.  The idea is that the download and process are both in the same block and both processed before moving on to the next operation in the queue.p  pExcept, we have now implemented OAuth2 on the server to authenticate the calls.p  pI have got this working by setting up an NXOAuth2Request through the NXOAuth2 library.  Then setting the account and pulling out the signed URL request.  Then I use this NSURLRequest as I was doing previously.p  pThe problem with this is that if the OAuth token expires half way through the sync then the sync fails.p  pThe NXOAuth2 library has a function...p  precode voidperformMethodNSString aMethod            onResourceNSURL aResource       usingParametersNSDictionary someParameters           withAccountNXOAuth2Account anAccount   sendProgressHandlerNXOAuth2ConnectionSendingProgressHandlerprogressHandler       responseHandlerNXOAuth2ConnectionResponseHandlerresponseHandler codepre  pThis handles the situation of an expired token by resending the request after doing a token refresh.p  pHowever, this function is asynchronous so Im not sure how best to fit it in to my sync program.p  pI could just add the operations using this and then put the processing into the completion block.  But doing this means that all the downloads will pretty much run all at the same time and then theres no way of guaranteeing the order in which the downloads get processed I need them to be processed in a strict order due to data dependencies.p  pThe only way I can think of doing this now is to daisychain them all together...p  precode[NXOAuth2Request performFirstRequest...              deal with the data.         [NXOauth2Request performSecondRequest...                              deal with the data.                 [NXOauth2Request performThirdRequest...                                              deal with the data.                         finish                      ]              ]       ] codepre  pAnd this is just messy and could get VERY messy.p  pIs there any other way I could process this at all  The only other thing I can think is to try and do the refreshing myself.p
Negative 1461 pI have some tags which I need to insert into the Tag database. The Tag database has only one column tag which is also the primary key.

Negative 1461 pIm having a very strange issue with running a python CGI script in IIS.p  pThe script is running in a custom application pool which uses a user account from the domain for identity. Impersonation is disabled for the site and Kerberos is used for authentication.p  ul liWhen the account is member of the codeDomain Adminscode group, everything works like a charmli liWhen the account is strongnotstrong member of codeDomain Adminscode, I get an error on the very first line in the script codeimport cgicode. It seems like that import eventually leads to a random number being generated and its the call to codeurandomcode which fails with a codeWindowsError [Error 5] Access is deniedcode.li liIf I run the same script from the command prompt, when logged in with the same user as the one from the application pool, everything works as a charm.li ul  pWhen searching the web I have found out that the codeurandomcode on windows is backed by the codeCryptGenRandomcode function in the operating system. Somehow it seems like my python CGI script does not have access to that function when running from the IIS, while it has access to that function when run from a command prompt.p  pTo complicate things further, when logging in as the account running the application pool and then invoking the CGIscript from the web browser it works. It turns out I have to be logged in with the same user as the application pool for it to work. As I previously stated, impersonation is disabled, but somehow it seems like the identity is somehow passed along to the security functions in windows.p  pIf I modify the coderandom.pycode file that calls the codeurandomcode function to just return a fixed number, everything works fine, but then I have probably broken a lot of the security functions in python.p  pSo have anyone experienced anything like this Any ideas of what is going onp

I am using the following code to measure the execution time of particular part of my programp  precodeclockt start,end printfDECODING DATAn startclock conv3decencoded, decoded,3length,0 endclock duration  doubleend  start  CLOCKSPERSEC printfDECODING TIME  fn,duration codepre  pwhere codeconv3deccode is a function defined in my program and I want to find the runtime of this function.p  pNow the thing is when my program runs, the codeconv3deccode functions runs for almost 2 hours but the output from the codeprintfDECODING TIME  fn,durationcode says that the execution of the function finished in just half a second codeDECODING TIME  0.455443code . This is very confusing for me.p  pI have used the codeclocktcode technique to measure the runtimes of programs previously but the difference has never been so huge. Is this being caused by the crosscompiler. Just as a side note, the simulator simulates a DSP processor running at just 500MHz, so is the difference in the clock speeds of the DSP processor and my CPU causing the error is measuring the CLOCKSPERSEC. p

Negative 1461 pI was having a similar problem as in a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions3797982howtoqueryabstractclassbasedobjectsindjangoHow to query abstractclassbased objects in Djangoa The thread suggests using multitableinheritance.

In this way, I can query StellarObjects through StellarType. So Id like to know whats the PRO and CON of using this approach against using multitableinheritance I think both create an additional table in the databse.

Negative 1461 pMy company sells videohosting services and we offer sharing to facebook of our customers videos. Videos are hosted on our platform and embedded on a customers page. When the end user clicks share we send a request to facebook to share the video. Facebook requires that the shared page contains meta tags with properties imagesrc and videosrc httpsupport.google.comwebmastersbinanswer.pyhlenampanswer162163 and we do this.p  pThe problem from the customers perspective is that they dont want to modify the  section of their page so we host this share page for them. For example customer owns website customer.com and embed videos from us so the videos are hosted on provider.com. When the end user clicks share we tell facebook that the correct meta tags for the video can be found on provider.com to make the sharing work. The problem becomes when facebook users click the link and end up on provider.com instead of customer.com website.p  pWe are thinking about introducing a js redirect from the landing page of provider.com to the appropriate page on customer.com. Technically this would be a good solution for us and for our customer but the question is if this is allowed by facebookp

This error may also be     caused by using internal types in the web service proxy without using the     InternalsVisibleToAttribute attribute. Please see the inner exception for more     details.

Some updates  more information br The web service uses windows authentication and impersonation. The only difference between test server and local machine is that the application pools run under different identities which in both cases is a technical domain user. The only difference Ive found is that the user on my local machine was not granted the Trusted for delegation flag in Active Directory. So I assumed it could be a Kerberos problem. However, when I run my restful WCF service and client, this never was a problem. Besides, using a windows forms client for the SOAP service, everything runs fine on my local machine and developingdebugging is just possible as intended. br So it has to be a Silverlight problem. br What I do not get is, assuming this dreaded security error results from a crossdomain policy problem as it does in most cases, where are those domains crossed Everything should be happining on the local machine, no other services are called. This shouldnt happen using IIS Express, should it br Anybody able to helpp
Negative 1461 pI am building an iPhone client with a Rails backend. The client communicates with the server through an Oauth2 API. Ive set this up using the oauth2 and doorkeeper gems.p  pEvery API request must be sent with a token. I currently support two token types p  ul liClient Using the Client Credentials grant type. This is for nonuserspecific requests, like accessing appwide assets, keys, etc.li liUser Using the Password Credentials grant type. To get this token, the client must request it by passing a valid usernamepassword combination. All user requests use this token.li ul  pThis is all working fine but Im hitting an issue now that Im allowing a user to also log into the app using Facebook.p  pUpon the user logging into FB, my client responds by passing the Facebook UID to my server using a Client token. I then do some checks on my server to match this UID to an existing user in my database.p  pHeres the issue I want to respond to this request with a User Token. This token is needed as the user will now be logged into the app, and any subsequent requests will need this token. However, currently I feel like the only way for me to do this isp  pRespond with the username and password. Then have the client make a request for a User Token following the Password Credentials flow. I dont like this because Im passing a password, and it requires multiple trips.p  pI feel like I may be missing something basic. Is there another way I should be handling this flowp

Negative 1461 pI am having rather a bother trying to bind setting a localstorage key to a modal close dialog.

Negative 1461 pI would like to build a nondeterministic monad transformer in haskell that, I believe, behaves differently from ListT and from the alternative ListT proposed at a hrefhttpwww.haskell.orghaskellwikiListTdoneright relnofollowhttpwww.haskell.orghaskellwikiListTdonerighta. The first of these associates a monad with a list of items the second associates a monad with individual items but has the property that monadic actions in given element influence monadic elements in subsequent slots of the list. The goal is to build a monad transformer of the formp  precodedata Amb m a  Cons m a Amb m a  Empty codepre  pso that every element of the list has its own monad associated with it and that successive elements have independent monads. At the end of this post I have a little demonstration of the kind of behavior this monad should give. If you know how to get some variant of ListT to give this behavior, that would be helpful too. p  pBelow is my attempt. It is incomplete because the codeunpackcode function is undefined.

Negative 1461 pI have an Inno Setup installer that needs to restart the explorer in order to install a shell extension. During installation, I can start explorer.exe with a hrefhttpwww.jrsoftware.orgishelpindex.phptopicisxfuncexecasoriginaluser relnofollowcodeShellExecAsOriginalUsercodea so that it doesnt start with admin privileges this is important on Windows 8, because running explorer with admin privileges prevents Metro apps from running.p  pThe trouble is that this function cant be called during uninstall, as stated in the documentation I tried to do it anyway, but of course it fails. I dont understand why its not possible. Any clue Is there a workaroundp
Negative 1461 pI have a base codeUINavigationControllercode, and 3 codeUIViewControllercode.p  pLets call them codeHome, VC2, and VC3code.p  pI have a storyboard segue from codeHomecode to codeVC2code, and from codeVC2code to codeVC3code.p  pNow...  if I call code[self.navigationController popToRootViewControllerAnimatedYES]code from within VC3, I get taken back to Home with the top codenavigationItemcode bar of VC2 Whatp  pIf I simply use the back button, the codenavigationItemcode top bar displays as expected for each of the views...p  pCan anyone suggest an alternative to codepopToRootViewControllerAnimatedBOOLcode, or codepopToViewControllerUIViewControllercode  Both cause the issue to occur..p  pEDIT Also, just to illustrate further what happens  Once I pop back to Home, the VC2s navigationItem is sitting there and it contains its own title and back button  if I hit the back button, the top bar slides off the right and now the top bar is empty. Again, this doesnt happen when using VC3back  VC2back buttons to get back to Home. Seems like a rather bad thing for UIKit to be doing, but maybe Im missing something.p

Negative 1461 pIm trying to add the hover selector to a class when hovering over a different div. Basically there are 2 divs forming a button. The top part is the part that changes color when hovered over and the bottom part is simply an image.

Negative 1461 pIm currently in the habit of using while loops with my queries to assign values to variables that I use later in code.

Im still pretty new to php and am starting to kind of get the hang of pdo, I think.  But, I dont know of a better way of assigning the needed values to my variables than this.

Negative 1461 pI have a node js script running Socket.io implementation in my web role.

Ive installed  codelibapache2modphp5code and upon running  codesudo a2enmod php5code I get codemodule php5 already enabledcode. So I think Ive pretty much narrowed the problem down to a php file authorizations issue.p  pNow I should point out that this only happened after I modified the config file to allow a codeUserDircode in my codehomepublichtmlcode.

Negative 1461 pI have recently been working on a pet project in python using flask. It is a simple pastebin with serverside syntax highlighting support with pygments. Because this is a costly task, I delegated the syntax highlighting to a celery task queue and in the request handler Im waiting for it to finish. Needless to say this does no more than alleviate CPU usage to another worker, because waiting for a result still locks the connection to the webserver. Despite my instincts telling me to avoid premature optimization like the plague, I still couldnt help myself from looking into async.p  pstrongAsyncstrongp  pIf have been following python web development lately, you surely have seen that async is everywhere. What async does is bringing back cooperativemultitasking, meaning each thread decides when and where to yield to another. This nonpreemptive process is more efficient than OSthreads, but still has its drawbacks.  At the moment there seem to be 2 major approachesp  ul lieventcallback style multitaskingli licoroutinesli ul  pThe first one provides concurrency through looselycoupled components executed in an event loop. Although this is safer with respect to race conditions and provides for more consistency, it is considerably less intuitive and harder to code than preemptive multitasking. p  pThe other one is a more traditional solution, closer to threaded programming style, the programmer only having to manually switch context. Although more prone to raceconditions and deadlocks, it provides an easy dropin solution.p  pMost async work at the moment is done on what is known as strongIOboundstrong tasks, tasks that block to wait for input or output. This is usually accomplished through the use of polling and timeout based functions that can be called and if they return negatively, context can be switched. p  pDespite the name, this could be applied to strongCPUboundstrong tasks too, which can be delegated to another workerthread, process, etc and then nonblockingly waited for to yield. Ideally, these tasks would be written in an asyncfriendly manner, but realistically this would imply separating code into small enough chunks not to block, preferably without scattering context switches after every line of code. This is especially inconvenient for existing synchronous libraries. p  hr  pDue to the convenience, I settled on using gevent for async work and was wondering how is to be dealt with CPUbound tasks in an async environmentusing futures, celery, etc. p  pHow to use async execution modelsgevent in this case with traditional web frameworks such as flask What are some commonly agreedupon solutions to these problems in pythonfutures, task queuesp  pstrongEDITstrong To be more specific  How to use gevent with flask and how to deal with CPUbound tasks in this contextp  pstrongEDIT2strong Considering how Python has the GIL which prevents optimal execution of threaded code, this leaves only the multiprocessing option, in my case at least. This means either using emconcurrent.futuresem or some other external service dealing with processingcan open the doors for even something language agnostic. What would, in this case, be some popular or oftenused solutions with geventstrongi.e.strong celery  best practicesp
Negative 1461 pI am currently writing functions using an educational assembly language called Y86, ATampT syntax and am trying to accomplishget around something this doesnt support.

Negative 1461 pI am trying to implement a saveui pipeline processor in Sitecore 6.  Basically I have created a custom processor that presents the user with a popup message depending on which fields they may have changed on the item and what the new data is.  If they made certain changes then they are presented with a popup asking them if they want to continue.  If they answer no then the pipeline is aborted.  That is all working.  However I noticed that when you abort the pipeline all Sitecore seems to do is not save.  All of the changes that the user made to the content item are still there in the UI.  If you navigate away from the item in Sitecore, it will prompt you if you want to save the changes.  Is there some way that I can get the Sitecore UI to cancel all of the changes and revert all of the fields back to their initial values  Aborting the pipeline is good because I dont want to save, but I also want to cancel the save in the UI too.  Does anyone know how to do thisp  pSample Codep  precodepublic class CustomSaveProcessor    public void ProcessSaveArgs args        Sitecore.Diagnostics.Assert.ArgumentNotNullargs, args     ifargs.Items  null      return       ifargs.IsPostback            ifargs.Parameters[runContext]  firstQuestion                ifargs.Result  null  args.Result  null  args.Result  no  args.Result  cancel                    args.AbortPipeline           Should there be something here to tell the Sitecore UI to reset the values           return                  else                    User has answered first question Yes           This means they want to save the changes to the item           We also want to ask a second question that effects other content items            SheerResponse.YesNoCancelDo you want to also modify other items, 300px, 200px           args.Parameters[runContext]  secondQuestion           args.WaitForPostBack                       else                ifargs.Result  yes                    This is the answer to second question           Custom code here to modify other content items                  We are completely done now.         return                 else            Ask the user the first question       SheerResponse.YesNoCancelAre you sure you want to proceed, 300px, 200px       args.Parameters[runContext]  firstQuestion       args.WaitForPostback          codepre

Negative 1461 pPython 2.7 does something very peculiar when you look at it under the hood for importing within a package.  Basically, it is storing relative imports of builtins among other things for reasons that I truly cannot understand.  Minimal use case is below.p  pAssume a directory structure in the formp  precodeBaseFolder     init.py     MainFile.py    TestFolder         init.py         TestModule.py codepre  pBoth init.py are empty.  The MainFile.py says onlyp  precodeimport TestFolder.TestModule import sys for x in sortedsys.modules.keys     print x codepre  pThe TestModule.py saysp  precodeimport os codepre  pRunning the MainFile.py with Python gives you the list of imported modules.  When you look through the keys for the modules, theres a bunch of junk, but you can find the following keysp  precodeTestFolder TestFolder.TestModule TestFolder.os ... os codepre  pIf you look at the values for those modules, TestFolder.os is None.  But why does it exist in the first place  Why would the modules list register a module that has been demonstrated to not exist when it looked for it  I assume that this occurs because the system checks for an os library in TestFolder first hence TestFolder.os, then looks in the builtins.  By why add an entry just because you checked  Does anyone have insight into why Python would do this  Maybe just so it never checks for libraries in those locations againp

Negative 1461 pIm using tinymce for a text editor on my web project handled by Jquery1.7.1. FYI, Its SPA, Single Page Application, so theres no refresh on every page move.p  pHeres the thing. for the very first try to open a page which has the editor, its toolbar doesnt appear. And for my second try, it does appear. interesting huhp  pIm going to give you more details on this. it seems that the toolbar appears for less than a sec, and then its gone immedieately. But I can sense that theres a moment it appears for very short time.p  pSo I pressed F12, took out the dev tool, and checked if the required HTML elements exist or not. Unfortunately they do, which drives me crazy.p  pUsing secondary monitor, I put two browser screens on each, and inspected it throughoutly, hoping that there would be a CSS discrepancy between the two  But, all to no avail.p  pI found nothing. what they have is identical. But one shows the toolbar, another doesnt. I cant get it. I think Im not able to. Theres no error or alert notification on the browser console window, not a single one. p  pIf there were a script error or something like that, I would be able to deal with this problem easily. But theres no clue what causes this stupid ui malfunction. Please help me out, or give me some clue.p

Negative 1461 pIve written a rather complicated set of classes to deal with iterating over a stream string, file or memory. These are NOT std streams nor are they related.

Negative 1461 pIm building a turnbased multiplayer game with Flash and PHP where each user polls the server every second for game updates.  Right now, each user is also responsible for checking when their opponents turn ends, when they get disconnected, and evaluating their moves.  I figure that this is too much responsibility for each user and it will be much safer if I had a constantly running PHP script on the server to check every game room every second.p  pIve experimented with a couple ways.  First I tried a cronjob to run a script every minute.  The script sleeps every second and checks every row on the game room table.  But I figured that I will run into problems when my table gets very large and cause long delays in responses.p  pMy next solution was to execute a separate instance of that looping script every time a user creates a game room.  The problem with this approach is that my server shuts down after 10 scripts are running at the same time.  Im not sure if this was due to a resource hog or a security measure. p  pIve also heard of using a daemon to run a service on the server, but have no idea how to implement this as I have been told it is quite difficult.p  pWhat would be my best solution to get my server to constantly check each game room and make processes sort of like acting as a card dealer  p

Negative 1461 pI have inherited a database which is an MS Access 97 frontend with a MySQL V5.2 backend. In MySQL I have a table with a Primary Key field set at VarChar 50.  This was setup because our reporting system uses an alpha numeric identification.  The same field in the linked Access table is set at text.  At present, I have a query which returns new sequential values over a set value eg S1234 to generate values which are then added to the above table.  The users then use these values to print a series sequentially numbered reports.  However, I have now come to value S9999 and users can no longer use the query to obtain values  S9999.  Any ideas of how to solve this problem would be appreciated. Thanks.p

Negative 1461 pI have a news steam being pulled from a MySQL table displaying things like headline, story and date. These news stories are generated from a PHP foreach loop and works fine. p  pI have two more MySQL tables, one for images and one for videos. These tables have a column called newsid that link with the news tables unique field. The idea is each news story will automatically display any videos or images attached too it.p  pThe code for this doesnt work correctly though  e.g. if a story has 3 matching images and one video it actually outputs that video 3 times, one next to each picture. Same if there were 5 videos and one picture, it would show that picture 5 times.p  pThe code worked ok when it was just pulling images next to the news but since I added the video table too the problem started. I think I need to rewrite the queries and foreach loop but have no idea how. My guess is that I need two foreach loops within the main foreach  one for images and one for videos.p  pHow I want it to work isp  pHeadline, Date and Story pulled for news tablep  pany photourls pulled from image tablep  pany videourls pulled from video tablep  pthen the next headline and so on.

Negative 1461 pGood afternoon everyone,p  pI am new here and only have reasonable knowledge about VBA, so please excuse if my terminology may not be right.p  pI have an excel file with several macros I have written. The main macro applies an autofilter to all my data based on a criteria I type in a cell on a separate sheet within the same workbook. The filter is working fine and if the criteria specified matches a record in my data then that data is copied and pasted into a separate sheet. Unfortunately, however, if I enter a criteria that is not present in the data, excelVBA copies all of my data each of the 7000 records and pastes the entire data into the separate sheet although no result was actually found. I was hoping you would be able to give me advice on how to overcoem this and what code to use to make the filter work properly.p  pBasically what I want is that if the filter cannot match any data, then no data is copiedpasted. My macro checks several criteria total 8 and then applies the autofilter. I dont know if I would need a code and add that to each of my code lines for each criteria, or only one at the end. p  pThank you for your helpp

Negative 1461 h2emEdited to be less opinionatedemh2  pWhich programming style of index iteration loop codeforcode vs. LINQs codewhereselectcode is preferred for strongreadability, performance, maintainability, and considered to be a modern stylestrongp  pThe example here uses a simple array of codeobjectcode called codeelementscode. Compare these 2 code samples below. Both produce the same result a list of codeTupleltstring, objectgtcode stored in a variable codeclassListcode. Every other element is a string, so the direct cast is fine.p  pstrongNonLINQ stylestrong provided by Cdric Bignonp  precodevar classList  new ListltTupleltstring, objectgtgt for var i  0 i lt elements.Length i  2   Only iterates for each class     classList.AddTuple.Createstringelements[i], elements[i  1] codepre  pstrongLINQ stylestrongp  precodevar classList  elements.Wheree, i gt i  2  0.Selecte, i gt Tuple.Createstringe, elements[i  2  1].ToList codepre  pIve gotten very accustomed to LINQ, so I can read either just fine, but my coworkers concern was if someone else needs to read the code that is not used to the LINQ coding style. I feel like both of these examples look ugly. For instance, you could make an extension method called codeEvencode to use instead of codeWheree, i gt i  2  0code, but that only adds to readability. p  pDo modern C developers use forloops I still want my code to remain fairly efficient, but I tend to like the functionalhorizontal style of LINQ better than topdown imperative style of forloops. Also, I understand that the answer may be a casebycase basis, but this is the example where I was questioning using a forloop.p

If example.dat also exists, do not overwrite it without explicit user constant.li ul  pHowever, having done a little research, I found that as well as OS caching which I may be able to override with the file flush methods, some disk drives still then cache internally and may even lie to the OS saying they are done, so 4. could complete, the write is not actually written, and if the system goes down I have lost my data...p  pI am not sure the disk problem is actually solvable by an application, but are the general rules above the correct thing to do Should I keep an old recovery copy of the file for longer to be sure, what are the guidelines regarding such things e.g. acceptable disk usage, should the user choose, where to put such files, etc..p  pAlso how should I avoid potential conflict the user and other programs for example.dat.tmp.

Negative 1461 pThis is a very simple code using the Windows API, where a child window is painted in the central part of the app window. By clicking with the mouse left button on the main window client area, the child window assumes a null height. By clicking with the mouse right button, the child window has its height increased by 10 pixels, at each mouse click. One can hear a beep every time a left, or right mouse click occurs in the windows app, due to the codeMessageBeep1code call made while painting the parent window.p  pThe curious thing is that when you drag one of the sides of the parent window, changing its width or height, very slowly, you can hear the beeps, at each move. But if you drag the windows side a little bit faster, youll hear just one beep, strongmany many secondsstrong after the mouse button was released.

Negative 1461 pI am updating some properties of my object in firebase using the update method. As part of the update call, can i also update the priority of my objectp  pI have a collection of objects stored in firebase. I am using the Javascript sdk to interact with my data. Whenever i update any property of an object, i set the priority of the object to Firebase.ServerValue.TIMESTAMP constant. p  pNow, i want to start storing the priority of each object in a property called UpdatedOnTimestampTs defined on the object. Whenever i update any property i will also update UpdatedOnTimestampTs with TIMESTAMP constant. p  pNow the problem is, I am unable to find a way to call the update function along with priority no updateWithPriority like setWithPriority. So if I update the UpdatedOnTimestampTs and priority in two different operations using the TIMESTAMP constant i may or will end up with a different values.p  pHow can i address thisp

Negative 1461 pI am interested in parsing tracklistings in a variety of formats, containing lines such as  p  precodeartist  title artisttitle artist  title artist  title 1. artist  title 000  artist  tit le 05 artist  title    1220 artist  title [record label] codepre  pThese are text files which generally contain one tracklist but which may also contain other stuff which I dont want to parse, so the regex ideally needs to be strict enough to not include lines which arent tracklistings, although really this is probably a question of balance.p  pI am having some success with the following regex  p  precodesimple  re.compiler  Plttimegtdddd  track time in 0000 or 000  Pltnumbergtd1,2    track number as 0 01 [w]                  not followed by word  [.]                 possibly followed by something  Pltartistgt[]    artist anything except   s[u2013]s                      dash surrounded by spaces, possibly unicode Plttitlegt[]    title, not greedy  Pltlabelgt[w]    label i.e. [something Records] amp13           remove some weird endings, i.e. ascii carriage return  , re.VERBOSE codepre  pHowever, its a bit horrible, I only started learning regex very recently. It has problems with lines like thisp  precodean artista title            couldnt find    2 Croozin  2 Pumpin       mistakes 2 as track number 05 artist  title  1220     doesnt work at all codepre  pIn the case of 2 Croozin  2 Pumpin, the only way of telling that 2 isnt a track number is to take into account the surrounding context, i.e. look at the other tracks. I forgot to mention this  these tracks are usually part of a tracklistp  pSo my question is, how can I improve this in general Some ideas Ive had arep  ul liUse several regex, starting with very specific ones and carry on using less specific ones until it has parsed properly.li lidump regex and use a proper parser such as pyparsing or parsley, which might be able to make better use of surrounding context, however I know absolutely nothing about parsingli liuse lookaheadlookbehind in a multiline regex to look at previousnext linesli liuse separate regex to get time, track number, artist, titleli ligive up and do something less pointlessli ul  pI can validate that it has parsed properly to some degree doing things such as making sure artists and titles are all different, tracks are in order, times are sensible, and possibly even check artiststitleslabels do actually exist.  p
Negative 1461 pI have an xml layout of about 3000 lines, which serves as the layout for a questionnaire type of app. Each page of the questionnaire is inside of a different linear layout and I set the visibility of the linear layouts in code using codeView.GONEcode or codeView.VISIBLEcode. This way the user can navigate through the pages without loading new codeintentscode each time.p  pHowever, when I navigate fast through the app just pressing the strongnextstrong codebuttoncode to go through the screens, some of the elements that are supposed to be codeView.GONEcode shows up and overlaps over the strongVISIBLEstrong items. This only happens with linear layouts that have list views inside of them. For all the other pages.p  pI can scroll fast through them, but just the ones with list views in the codeView.GONEcode elements sometimes shows up when I navigate too fast. How can I fix this  Let me know if you want code ... however the xml is very large.p  pT.I.A.p  pstrongEDITstrongp  pThis is a sample of my xml code, I have 3000 lines of this repeating in my xml...p

Negative 1461 pIm just starting with angularjs, and am working on converting a few old JQuery plugins to Angular directives. Id like to define a set of default options for my element directive, which can be overridden by specifying the option value in an attribute.p  pIve had a look around for the way others have done this, and in the a hrefhttpangularui.github.ioangularuia library the a hrefhttpsgithub.comangularuibootstrapblobmastersrcpaginationpagination.jsui.bootstrap.paginationa seems to do something similar.p  pFirst all default options are defined in a constant objectp  precode.constantpaginationConfig,    itemsPerPage 10,   boundaryLinks false,   ...  codepre  pThen a codegetAttributeValuecode utility function is attached to the directive controllerp  precodethis.getAttributeValue  functionattribute, defaultValue, interpolate      return angular.isDefinedattribute              interpolate  interpolateattributescope.parent                             scope.parent.evalattribute  defaultValue  codepre  pFinally, this is used in the linking function to read in attributes asp  precode.directivepagination, [parse, paginationConfig, functionparse, config      ...     controller PaginationController,     link functionscope, element, attrs, paginationCtrl          var boundaryLinks  paginationCtrl.getAttributeValueattrs.boundaryLinks,  config.boundaryLinks         var firstText  paginationCtrl.getAttributeValueattrs.firstText, config.firstText, true         ...       codepre  pThis seems like a rather complicated setup for something as standard as wanting to replace a set of default values. Are there any other ways to do this that are common Or is it normal to always define a utility function such as codegetAttributeValuecode and parse options in this way Im interested to find out what different strategies people have for this common task.p  pAlso, as a bonus, Im not clear why the codeinterpolatecode parameter is required.p

Negative 1461 pTrying to make my OOP fundamentals strong based of objective C. Sorry if my explanation is too long. I have 3 classes in my app as Class A, Class B and Class C objective C classes. I have a property of class A in my implementation of class B i.e. it makes private property of class B.p  precode implementation Class B interface ClassB    property nonatomic, strong ClassA classA end codepre  pI create an instance of class B in one of my class C methods and try to access class A property through class Bs instance in class C.p  precode implementation Class C interface ClassC    property nonatomic, strong ClassB classB end  implementation ClassC  voidsomeMethod    NSString string  [[NSString alloc] init]   classB  [[ClassB alloc] init]   string  classB.classA.displayString get an error here  ClassB doesnt have classA.  end codepre  pTo avoid the error I moved the classA property from implementation to header in ClassB.p  precode header Class B interface ClassB  NSObject   property nonatomic, strong ClassA classA end codepre  pBut I am worried that anybody class can create an instance of class B, access classA property and can then usemodify the properties which are part of class A.p  pemstrongQuestionemstrong Is it a good style to move the classA property to the header file of Class B so I can use it in Class C or should I create a method in Class B which returns me whatever I need from class A Something likep  precodeimplementation ClassB  NSStringdisplayStringOfClassA    classA  [[ClassA alloc] init]   return self.classA.displayString  end codepre

Negative 1461 pI am working on designing a bejeweled style game with a twist.  Rather than trying to match all the blocks of the same shape, you are trying to match a pair of letters.  The board will always have roughly 10 letters on the board and you are trying to get them together.  There are three different color blocks.  Each color has 1 blank block and then 5 blocks with different letters.  The goal is to get say a red T block next to a red A block.  This is where I am running into problems.p  pRight now, the code will clear from the board three or more of the same color and letter.  So, if I can get three red T blocks next to each other they will clear.  The code basically scans each line looking for a group of three or more.  I have tried to modify the code so it will clear even just the same color regardless of letter combo but I cant even get that working.  I think it has to do with how I load the images.  I have posted most of the code without any of my crazy modifications to try and get this working since it just broke it that deals with loading the images and finding matches.  Can anybody help me modify the code so it can at least find one correct match.  When a red T block is next to a red A block and a blank red block, it should be classified as a match and be removed from the board.  It doesnt need to be anything that complex as long as it works.

It has sound and background music, the groundwork for a new scoring system, a new timer system, and I can specify which rare shape I want to appear in a specific spot on the grid when the game first starts.  However, I am still having issues with the core gameplay.  I hate to drag up and older post, but I am at a loss as to how to get this to work.  I have messed around with the code dealing with matches with no luck.  p  pBasically, the rareshapes are assigned numbers.  So, a red A is 0, a red T is 3, all the way up to a yellow T which is 14.  For the gameplay to work the way we intend, the user will need to get a red A 0, a red T3, and 2 blank red squares next to each other for it to be a valid match and clear from the board.  This is the ONLY correct way you can clear squares from the board.  Getting 4 blank squares of the same color next to each other DOES NOT remove them.p  pHowever, the code needs to detect if they get an invalid pair as well.  For example, if they get a red A0, a red C1, and two blank red squares, it will disappear but count as a strike against them.  p  pThe goal of the game is to remove all the letter blocks before time runs out without getting three strikes.  Since we can specify how many and where letter blocks appear now, it just comes down to the matching.  Does anybody have any idea how to make this work  p

Negative 1461 pI am semiforking Redmine for my company and rarely pulling improvements from upstream. I prefer to use SLIM over ERB for views. My idea is that I want to keep erb files intact for the sake of easier diffing when I pull changes from upstream, still I want to only use SLIM versions of the templates. So where I havep  precodeindex.html.erb codepre  pandp  precodeindex.html.slim codepre  pI want Rails to only search for index.html.slim and take no notice about the existence of the erb variant. Is it possible to make the two variants coexist sidebyside in the same folder and only use SLIM herep
Negative 1461 pIm drawing up an interactive map in RaphaelJS and have it working pretty good, but Im stuck currently. Each region of the map has a label and on hover, the path needs to fill in and the label needs to change color. p  pIve got the animation triggering to fill the region, I can also animate the text in the same function, however, when you mouseover the text it treats it as a mouseout on the region. So I need them to be animating together. p  pIve trying using sets but im not exactly sure how it should all work, my attempts so far have been unsuccessful. Here is some code,p  pMy Paths and text are all repeated like thisp  precodevar text1808  rsr.set text1808.pushrsr.text0, 0, 1808 text1808.attr   fill 0A4E74,   fontfamily sourcesanspro,   fontsize 14.9932,   strokewidth 0,   strokeopacity 1,   parent text1808  text1808.transformm0.9587 0 0 1 194.3486 207.7305.dataid, text1808  var path1808  rsr.set path1808.pushrsr.pathM 204.229,244.362 204.229,227.229   182.418,227.229 182.418,170.131 196.231,170.131 196.231,159.05 190.202,159.05 190.202,146.476 223.082,146.476 223.082,153.354   222.255,153.354 222.255,175.604 246.281,175.604 246.281,244.362  z path1808.attr   fill ffffff,   stroke 0A4E74,   parent suite1808,   strokelinecap round,   strokelinejoin round,   strokewidth 1,   strokeopacity 1 .dataid, path1808 codepre  pThen I call the animations like sop  precodevar suites  [pathq, pathr, paths, patht, pathu, path1808, pathw] var labels  [text1808, textac, textad, textae, textaf, textag, textah]  for i  0 i lt suites.length i  el  suites[i]  ifel  undefined      el.mouseoverfunction           this.animate cursor pointer, fill 0A4E74 , 200             el.mouseoutfunction            this.animate fill ffffff , 200             el.clickfunction            this.animate fill EC008C , 200          codepre  pp  pso this code works in that it fills the region properly, but then triggers the mouse out when you mouse over the text.

Negative 1461 pIm building an iOS app using a Storyboard. The root view controller is a Tab Bar Controller. Im creating the loginlogout process, and its mostly working fine, but Ive got a few issues. I need to know the BEST way to set all this up.p  pI want to accomplish the followingp  ol liShow a login screen the first time the app is launched. When they login, go to the first tab of the Tab Bar Controller.li liAny time they launch the app after that, check if they are logged in, and skip straight to the first tab of the root Tab Bar Controller.li liWhen they manually click a logout button, show the login screen, and clear all the data from the view controllers.li ol  pWhat Ive done so far is set the root view controller to the Tab Bar Controller, and created a custom segue to my Login view controller. Inside my Tab Bar Controller class, I check whether they are logged in inside the codeviewDidAppearcode method, and a perform the segue code[self performSegueWithIdentifierpushLogin senderself]code p  pI also setup a notification for when the logout action needs to be performed code[[NSNotificationCenter defaultCenter] addObserverself selectorselectorlogoutAccount namelogoutAccount objectnil]codep  pUpon logout, I clear the credentials from the Keychain, run code[self setSelectedIndex0]code and perform the segue to show the login view controller again.p  pThis all works fine, but Im wondering strongshould this logic be in the AppDelegatestrong I also have two issuesp  ul listrongThe first time they launch the appstrong, the Tab Bar Controller shows briefly before the segue is performed. Ive tried moving the code to codeviewWillAppearcode but the segue will not work that early.li liWhen they logout, all the data is still inside all the view controllers. If they login to a new account, the old account data is still displayed until they refresh. strongI need a way to clear this easily on logout.strongli ul  pIm open to reworking this. Ive considered making the login screen the root view controller, or creating a navigation controller in the AppDelegate to handle everything...

Negative 1461 pI have an UPDATE statement in SQL Server that runs several UDFs encapsulating necessary business logic.  So a user can opt in or opt out of communications with our company and we have a bunch of permission codes corresponding to the various communications we send people.  We not only have a permission field but we have a Do Not Promote field as well.  If someone has opted out of a permission then we want to move it and its associated permissions to the DNP field.p  pSo Lets say a user has the following field valuesp  precodePermissionCodes                DoNotPromoteCode ABCD                       Z codepre  pNow the user opts out of A but when he opts out of A then our company wants to opt him out of codes C and G as well and add those values to the DoNotPromote field, but only add them to the DNP if they were in the Permissions field. i.e.p  precodePermissionCodes                DoNotPromoteCode BD                           ZAC codepre  pSo I have this queryp  precodeUPDATE Permissions SET PermissionCodes  dbo.RemovePermissionsA,     DoNotPromoteCodes  dbo.AddDoNotPromoteA, PermissionCodes WHERE Email  john.doeyahoo.com codepre  pThe UDF dbo.RemovePermissions will remove the Permission you pass in and all other Permissions that are related to it. The UDF dbo.AddDoNotPromote adds the permission to the DoNotPromote field and then searches PermissionCodes for relatives to that codes and adds them to the DoNotPromote Field.p  pSo, my question is, since I am updating the PermissionCodes field at the same time I am referencing it in the dbo.AddDoNotPromte UDF, when during the update statement is the PermissionCodes field being read within the dbo.AddDoNotPromote UDF  So far I am getting the results that I was hoping for, but is it always guaranteed that dbo.AddDoNotPromote will read the values in the PermissionCodes field before dbo.RemovePermissions removes those values p

The unresolved external symbols are for functions I have defined myself, not from external libraries.  I have a .h file for the function declaration, and a .c for its implementation. The module calling these functions is also a .c file. Both source files are explicitly compiled as C code I have c code in my project too.

What I dont understand is this sentence in bold, not in the picture p  blockquote   pIn the MIPS architecture, since words are aligned to multiples of four   bytes, strongthe least significant two bits are ignoredstrong when selecting a   word in the block.p blockquote  pSo lets say I have this two adresses p  precode    [1........0]10     [1........0]00                        same 30 bits for boths [3112] for the tag and [112] for the index see figure below codepre  pAs I understand the first one will result in a MISS I assume that the initial cache is empty. So one slot in the cache will be filled with the data located in this memory adress.p  pNow, we took the second one, since it has the same 30 bits, it will result in a HIT in the cache because we access the same slot because of the same 10 bits and the 20 bits of the adress are equals to the 20 bits stored in the Tag field.p  pSo in result, well have the data located at the memory code[1........0]10code and not code[1........0]00code which is wrong p  pSo I assume this has to do with the sentence I quote above.

Negative 1461 pi Am creating an app where one of my activities will be making use of fragments. In each fragment view, I am going to be pulling from a data base using three files, three adapters in each view. The first fragment works as expected. However, when I add my json parser code to the second swipe view, I see it tries to fire as soon as the activity is loaded  i make the second swipe view toast and The json parser will not load any data into my second view. Should I attach the JSON to the main activity and switch the adapters and URLs as i switch views or should i try to load the JSON from every fragment which is what I am doing now.

Negative 1461 pI wrote a performance test class marked as codeIgnorecode because it takes a very long time to run and I dont normally need to run it.  Id like to be able to right click one of the codeTestcodes and say run but when I do that in intellij it doesnt run the test because the class is marked as ignored.  p  pI dont want to comment out the codeIgnorecode because its too easy to accidentally commit the file with the codeIgnorecode removed.  But I feel that if I explicitly tell Intellij to run a test it should run it regardless of the codeIgnorecode.  Keep in mind, if I run a group of classes eg all in a package I still would want this test class to be ignored.  p  pIs it possible to get this functionality in Intellijp

Negative 1461 pIve recently migrated from using MySQL to PDO. Originally, I had a class which was a wrapper for the MySQLi object, providing some basic functions and settings I used a lot.p  pI want to do the same thing for PDO.

Negative 1461 pIs it possible that 1 job is being processed twice by 2 different sidekiq threads I am using sidekiq to insert some analytics events into a mongodb collection, asynchronously. I see around 15 duplicates in that collection. My guess is that 2 worker threads picked the same job, at the same time, and added to the collection.p  pDoes sidekiq ensure that the job is picked only by 1 thread. We can ignore the restart case, as the jobs are small and will complete in less than 8s.p  pIs firing analytics events asynchronously using sidekiq not a good practice What are my options I could add a unique key to the event and check it before insert to avoid insertion of duplicates, but thats adding data  an overheadquery that I am never going to use and it adds up for millions of events. Can I somehow ensure that a job is processed only once by sidekiqp  pThanks for your help.p

Negative 1461 pI have a GridView loaded by an SqlDataSource with the System.Data.OracleClient provider using a select command that returns 8 rows.p  pWhen the page loads, the time between the Selecting and Selected events is 35 seconds. Ive verified that the query is really taking this long by looking at the elapsed time in vsessionlongops on the Oracle server.p  pIf I cut and paste the exact same query into sql developer, it runs in 12 seconds and returns the same 8 rows.p  pIf I dump the query results into a table and use that table for my page load, it runs in less than 1 second.p  pDoes anyone have any suggestions for things I should be looking at Other queries on the website dont seem to be affected  the only thing I can think of that is different with this query is that it does take 12 seconds and most of the other queries start returning data faster than that.p  pETA The reason the query is slower is that it is using a different query plan. Presumably some session parameter is different with the two connections that causes a different query plan to be selected, but setting everything listed in vparameter2 including plscope, plsqldebug, and plsqloptimizelevel so they match does not replicate the problem in sql developer.p

Negative 1461 pIn the discussion below a hrefhttpcode.tutsplus.comtutorials3reasonstochooseangularjsforyournextprojectnet28457this articlea theres a comment by Renan Cakirerk to the effect that, according to an Angular developer, Angular UI performance might degrade beyond 2000 databound objects. p  pIt made me seriously consider whether pursuing my nontrivial app with Angular is a good idea. A good app is a fast app after all.  I dont want to invest months building something to be bitten at the end.p  pI am interested in hearing from Angular strongnontrivialstrong app builders about p  ul ligeneral strategies people have successfully used for dealing with performance degradation li lispecific strategies based on my requirements and design pattern belowli liwhether I should abandon Angular altogether at this early stage in the project to avoid a looming grind to haltli ul  pIts too much of a risk to wait for the possible ES6 power and perf boons like codeObject.observecode and future versions that will might developers more finegrained control on the codeapplycode  codedigestcode cycle so that codescopecodelimited dirtychecking can be triggered Brian Frichette mentions these in the same discussion. I want to know that complex apps can be fast today on v1.2.15.p  pMore details about my problemsolution...p  pIm building an app with very rich functionality, where each object eg user has many functions that can be done to it, eg linking them to other users, changing their properties, sending them messages, etc. p  pThe spec has upwards of 20 functions on this object droppable zones, context sensitive toolbar icons eg the way Word has minitoolbars that appear near the mouse when you select some text.p  pThese options need to hide and show based on certain mouse actions, like hovering and dragging, and depend on the state of the particular user object many icons and drop options will show in some circumstances and not othersp  pNow, the way Ive strongstartedstrong building this is to have each individual icon and drop area, drag handle, etc as a separate databound element with an ngshow or similar thats keyed into our custom business logic.p  pEgp  precodeltusergt   ltmenuicon1 ngshowbusinesslogic1gt   ltmenuicon2 ngshowbusinesslogic2gt   ltdropzone1 ngshowbusinesslogic3gt   ltdraghandle ngshowbusinesslogic4gt   ltchangessavedicon ngshowbusinesslogic5gt   ..... ltusergt codepre  pAssuming the 2000 theoretical limit above is to be feared, then 20 custom showable hideable bits means 100 users shown using the amazing ngrepeat is my limit Maybe showing 100 is silly and I can attack this with filtering etc, but it seems to me that dividing by 20 drastically reduces my object bandwidth. And what happens when the boss wishes to add 10 more functionsp  pIf I were doing this the jQuery way, Id probably construct and destroy many of the icons and menu items as needed. Slightly less responsive per hoverdrag, but at least the app can scale the number of objects that way.p

Negative 1461 pWebSockets a hrefhttpstools.ietf.orghtmlrfc6455section5.5.2have the optiona of sending pings to the other end, where the other end is supposed to respond with a pong.p  blockquote   pUpon receipt of a Ping frame, an endpoint MUST send a Pong frame in      response, unless it already received a Close frame.  It SHOULD      respond with Pong frame as soon as is practical.p blockquote  pTCP a hrefhttptldp.orgHOWTOTCPKeepaliveHOWTOoverview.htmloffers something similara in the form of keepalivep  blockquote   p[Y]ou send your peer a keepalive probe packet with no data in it and the ACK flag turned on. You can do this because of the TCPIP specifications, as a sort of duplicate ACK, and the remote endpoint will have no arguments, as TCP is a streamoriented protocol. On the other hand, you will receive a reply from the remote host which doesnt need to support keepalive at all, just TCPIP, with no data and the ACK set.p blockquote  pI would think that TCP keepalive is more efficient, because it can be handled within the kernel without the need to transfer data up to user space, parse a websocket frame, craft a response frame, and hand that back to the kernel for transmission. Its also less network traffic.p  pFurthermore, WebSockets a hrefhttpstools.ietf.orghtmlrfc6455section1.7are explicitly specifieda to always run over TCP theyre not transportlayer agnostic, so TCP keepalive is always availablep  blockquote   pThe WebSocket Protocol is an independent TCPbased protocol.p blockquote  pSo why would one ever want to use WebSocket pingpong instead of TCP keepalivep

Negative 1461 pGood day all. some times ago I asked about modifying an apk on the fly, the thing I would like to achieve is to track an ak from the download to the uninstall, via some track calls during its life.p  pthe first thing first, of course is to find some way to brand it before the user downloads it on the phone.p  pthings to take in advice are  I will not use the normal store to give the apk to people. I cant make the user wait for 30 seconds during the download to make the build on the fly. I cant ask users to register, or login Im not able to arrive to that part to the server, too bad.p  pso far I have only guessd about modify the apk code on the fly, to search for a pattern in its code, and change it accordingly to my needs and save it on the database.p  pfor example, lets say that in the values.xml there is a url like thisp  precode www.server.comtokenxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx codepre  pbefore servince the apk to the user, i search for the pattern codexxxxxxxxxxxxxxxcode and change it with an alphanumeric value that i save on db, later, when the user go to the url via the apk, he will bring the token value and I could continue to track him again and again... p  pok, this is the situation.. my question is simple... strongany ideasstrong am I mad... does someone already do this without any efforts and Im try to reinvent the wheelp

Negative 1461 pWhenever Ive had to create an AST in Scala, Ive used the abstract sealed trait case class pattern.  Its worked really well so far, having compiler checked pattern matching is a big win.p  pHowever now Ive hit a problem that I cant wrap my head around.  What if I have 2 languages where one is a subset of the other  As a simple example consider a lambda calculus where every variable is bound, and another related language where the variables could be bound or free.p  pFirst languagep  precode  abstract sealed class Expression    case class Variableval scope Lambda, val nameString extends Expression    case class Lambdaval v Variable, val inner Expression extends Expression    case class Applicationval function Expression, val input Expression extends Expression codepre  pSecond Languagep  precode  abstract sealed class Expression    case class Variableval nameString extends Expression    case class Lambdaval v Variable, val inner Expression extends Expression    case class Applicationval function Expression, val input Expression extends Expression codepre  pWhere the only change is the removal of scope from Variable.p  pAs you can see there is a lot of redundancy.  But because Im using sealed classes, its hard to think of a good way to extend it.  Another challenge to combining them would be that now every Lambda and Application needs to keep track of the language of its parameters, at the type level.p  pThis example is not so bad because it is very small, but imagine the same problem for strict HTMLweak HTML.p

Negative 1461 pThis is kind of a ridiculous thing to do, but for some backstory we develop a number of java packages that become part of a large, unwieldy system.  We have no control over the builds for this large system. We just check code into a subversion repo and jenkins takes over from there.  The problem weve had in the past is that we have no indication that the code we checked in is actually running in any of the test or production environments. The group doing these builds is incompetent at best and cant seem to provide any real information. This continuous build environment does not lend itself to us changing minor version numbers every time a code change is made.  And there are about a dozen packages so Id prefer not to have to update version numbers in all those places all the time. but I am prepared to accept that as the only viable solution if needed.p  pWhat Id like to do, and this is completely pieinthesky, is have maven do something as part of the building of our packages, where it generates a hash value based on all the .java files in a package and outputs that value to a resource file which also gets picked up when packaged. The classes within these .java files, when outputting log messages, will be able to append this hash value somewhere in the log string since the logging framework will read this hash value from this resources file.  So at runtime, we can tell which version of our packages is actually running.  This has its downsides for sure... p  pbut part of me just wants to see if this will work. Im fairly new to maven and Ive been unsuccessful at searching for just the right thing in this case. p  plet the flames begin...p
Negative 1461 pI have a Access database as front end to a SQL Server back end database. I created a simple form to get the name of the user and I set this form as a display form. Now the value typed in this form is stored into a table in sql server, but since it is the backend db, it requires logging in to the SQL Server. Now the problem is when I try to open access from a different PC, the security warning comes up and asks to enable content. Now the display form does not allow me to enable content and the vba code will not run unless I enable content. I need some help to find a solution to this problem. Can I somehow delay the display form from showing up until the enable content is clicked Thank You.p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comWlrLT.png altenter image description herep

Negative 1461 pIn AutoHotKey, I want to have something like InputBox except that the text input is multiline. i.e. like a textarea. p  pI want there to be two buttons, Ok and Cancel, and I want them both to have accelerators. I want this code to be in the form of a function that I can call from other hotkeys to get multiline user input whenever I want. I want to be able to set the default text shown when the dialog is shown. I want the function to return null or empty string if the cancel button was pressed. I want the Esc key to cause the dialog to be closed as if the cancel button was pressed and not exit the entire script. I want the dialog to show in the center of the screen, and to use the font that Windows usually uses for dialogs.p

These are files such as strong.OGG sound filesstrong, basically files used to load content into the game, that werent packed inside the emminecraft.jarem executable.p  pIm working with Eclipse to develop Java applications, and I wonder, since you can import any kind of file into an Eclipse project, which would then be packed into an executable .jar upon export, what are the cons by packing a majority of the items, such as content, text files etc. into the project To decrease the size of the .jarp  pId say, packing more things into a .jar would presume a bit more portability, embutem would result bit bigger size.p  pPerhaps my opinion wouldnt follow proper, and if so  why do Java developers want to, if they typically do, leave a lot of files beside the .JAR, for the .JAR to read Especially static files files that will not be modified or movedp  pThank youp

Negative 1461 pI have a number of identical SQL Azure databases for like clients that need to have their versions tracked. SQL Azure in November of 2014 does not support extended properties as far as I know, if it did I could do something with extended properties for tracking versioning changes as was done herep  pa hrefhttpwateroxconsulting.comarchivesversioninginyoursqldatabase relnofollowhttpwateroxconsulting.comarchivesversioninginyoursqldatabaseap  pI was thinking of adapting that  concept by making a DDL trigger that altered a stored procedure that held nothing but versioning comments. p  pSo my question is about strategy  is a stored procedure the best place to keep this kind of info, or is there a better place to store textual versioning info in a SQL Azure container I do not necessarily want to add a table to each database because that will dilute the purpose of the DB and leaves room for antics and it will need its own care and feeding of its table structure and etc. p  pAnd my followup question is about tactics  what is the best way to alter a procedure completely in TSQL doing string manipulation to append comment textp  pThanks. p

Heres the marshallerp  precodeclass AdultPlanningMarshaller implements ObjectMarshallerltJSONgt      boolean supportsObject theObject              return theObject instanceof AdultPlanning           void marshalObjectObject theObject, JSON theConverter              AdultPlanning adult  AdultPlanningtheObject          JSONWriter writer  theConverter.getWriter          writer.object          writer.keyid.valueadult.id         ...             writer.endObject       codepre  pIm registering it in bootstrap.groovy and when I run my integration tests, the supports method fires correctly and the marshalObject method is called with the right object and a JSON object.p  pWhen I hit thep  precodewriter.object codepre  pcall, an exception gets thrownp  precodeorg.codehaus.groovy.grails.web.json.JSONException Misplaced object expected mode of INIT, OBJECT or ARRAY but was DONE codepre  pSo it looks like the writer has already done something to completion, but I have no clue what.p  pTheres not a lot of documentation on JSON marshallers and examples are thin on the ground, but I think Ive done this right but it sure isnt working.  Any hints would be appreciated.p  pFurther work with the debugger seems to indicate that the object marshaller is being called twice, although breakpoints only happen on the 2nd call for some reason.  The first time through it seems to work just fine since the JSONWriter that I get via theConverter.getWriter when the breakpoint DOES work has the JSON of the object correctly marshalled.  Its the 2nd call that is blowing up since the object has ALREADY been marshalled and the JSONWriter is no longer in the init state.  Theres nothing obviously available to tell the difference between the two calls, but why it the marshaller being called twicep  pAs requested, heres the controller.

Negative 1461 pToday I struggled with an issue which I would like to share with you, and get your opinion on how to best solve this in my app.p  pstrongContextstrong  What I want is to have a layout with an ActionBar and Fragments. For the Fragments I use the default code by Android Studio using a ViewPager with SectionsPagerAdapter which fills with PlaceholderFragments. The different Fragments have one XML, and differ by some TextViews that I alter in the onViewCreated override of the PlaceholderFragments class based on the tab postition. Also, I want the Fragments to have a slightly different layout in landscape mode, so I added a fragmentactivity.xml to the reslayoutland directory. In this Activity I made a class, and in this class I have a method called updateControlButtonsp  precodepublic class SomeActivity extends ActionBarActivity implements ActionBar.TabListener ...   Override   protected void onCreateBundle savedInstanceState      super.onCreatesavedInstanceState     setContentViewR.layout.activityhangboard       Set up the action bar.     final ActionBar actionBar  getSupportActionBar     Log.ionCreate, actionBar.toString     ...         private class SomeClass         public void updateControlButtons         ...            runOnUiThreadnew Runnable                  public void run                      ActionBar actionBar  getSupportActionBar                     actionBar.hide                     Log.iupdateControlButtons, actionBar.toString                     getWindow.clearFlagsWindowManager.LayoutParams.FLAGKEEPSCREENON  KeepScreenOn off                     ...                                    ...             .....    codepre  pTo handle the orientation changes of the device, I have to reinitialize several TextViews to the current tab, and also to the current state of what was going on on the screen which is based on fields stored in SomeClass. For that I override the onViewCreated method as followsp  precode    Override     public void onViewCreatedView view, Nullable Bundle savedInstanceState          default code         super.onViewCreatedview, savedInstanceState this does not really do something          int position  getArguments.getIntARGSECTIONNUMBER          Log.iTEST onViewCreated position, Integer.toStringposition          switch position               no 0             case 1 BEGINNER                 someTextView.setText005                 break             ...

Then I could replace getSupportActionBar with that updated field. I would also have to do that for the Window, to have a correct call to p  precodegetWindow.addFlagsWindowManager.LayoutParams.FLAGKEEPSCREENON codepre  pBy the way, using the setRetainInstancetrue call does not work for me, as I actually want to change the layout in landscape mode.p  pstrongQuestionstrong I do not like this way, it feels as if I should update way too much upon a simple orientation change of the device. Something that in my opinion should and is not even stored in the SomeClass Could this not be solved in an easier or more elegant wayp

Negative 1461 pFirst of all let me just say that this is the first time i use python and i know nothing about parallel computing so my question might be a bit silly.p  pA friend runs some simulations on a cluster that runs on CentOS 5.5. For each run the program tripoli takes as input 3 files. First file contains data to be processed, second file is the output file store results in this file and the third file is the file that indicates how the workload will be distributed on the cluster graphe.save . p  pFrom one run to another the only thing that changes is a specific line in the input file. That is line 14.176. I stored all the possible values for that line on a different file. Ill call it isotopes file. p  pSo my logic so far is. Open isotopes file. Take all data. for isotopes[1] open input file. write isotopes[1] to inputfile[14175]. close input file. run the program for this input file. Once you finished repeat for isotopes[2]. Each run takes about 50 to 60 minutes.p  pI thought polling a qhost command to see when node load is below a threshold  0.5  for example  in order to figure whether computation is done or not but it just seems bad practice.p  pI was expecting subprocess.call to behave the same way it does for something like this codesubprocess.callCWindowsSystem32.calc.execodestarts calc and halts there until calc is closed. I mean i expected that tripoli would start running and python would halt to that point until tripoli would reach the end of computation. But it does not. Once i hit run, tripoli starts as many instances as there are lines in the data file.  p  pWhat am i missing herep  pThe code i have so farp  precodeimport os import os.path import re import datetime import subprocess  def getLinesfromFilefiletobeOp, mode     with open filetobeOp, mode as temp       data  temp.readlines       temp.close return data   isotope  getLinesfromFileisotopes,r  for i, element in enumerateisotope     runs1     data  getLinesfromFileinputfile,r     data[14175]telement     tempElement  element.replacen,      commandRunTripoli  .run.sh inputfile tempElement.rsplit , 1[0].out    graphe.save      with opentmt,w as f2         f2.writelinesdata         f2.close      subprocess.callcommandRunTripoli      printdatetime.datetime.now     printTripoli run , runs, with isotope, element codepre  pThe run.sh file contains the followingp  precodebinsh                                                                                                                                                                                                                         export LDLIBRARYPATHusrlocalTRIPOLI4.8CODEliblinuxintel      4LDLIBRARYPATH  rm f .update graphe graphe.port lastsimulation mpirun  homenefeli.tripoli48Execbinlinuxintel64statictripoli4 d   1 s NJOY c homenefeli.tripoli48ExecEnvt4path.ceav5 o  2 p 3 t bsd  amp rm f .update graphe graphe.port lastsimulation codepre  pAs kjp indicated the problem was that i was sending the process to the background amp in the .sh file. My friend uses ssh to connect to the server and run the simulations. A simulation takes time  about 60 minutes  and there are a lot of simulations to be done. So if the laptop powers off, the connection is lost and the process is killed. I thought that he could run the script using nohup and ampersand  nohup python3 script.py amp  so that the process would continue executing even after connection was lost, but isnt nohup doing the same as amp  I mean if i run the command using nohup wouldnt i be sending the process to the background therefore causing the script to malfunction p

Negative 1461 pHi I have created an Interceptor for Retry Support and I mark methods with a RetryAttribute.p  pI have implemented an IInterceptorSelector to only return the Interceptor if the type has a method with that custom attribute.p  pIn the RetryInterceptor class I look for that attribute on the method provided by the invocation and if it exists I run the retry logic.p  pI was hoping to have the IInterceptorSelector filter the set of interceptors on a method basis but the method passed in is other the interface type not the actual class implementing it. Is there a way to do this p  pThanks.p

Negative 1461 pIm currently building a compass app in HTML and CSS in a PhoneGap project with the a hrefhttpsgithub.comapachecordovaplugindeviceorientation relnofollowDeviceOrientation plugina to get the compass heading.p  pI created a hrefhttpjsbin.comweruzujizi21edit relnofollowa jsbin to emulate the heading changea.p  pThe problem Im having is that when the value changes frequently every 200 ms, the CSS transition stutters quite a bit.p  pYou can see this problem in action by going to the jsbin I linked above and slowly drag the slider to increase or decrease the rotation degree, especially when you drag the slider back and forth slowly.p  pThat leads me to believe that this is not just a performance or framerate issue its most likely caused by the quick value changes that interrupt the transition.p  pstrongPlease notestrong in the actual PhoneGap application, the compass value is refreshed every 200 milliseconds or some other arbitrary interval instead of the inconsistent update interval you see in the jsbin simulation.p  pI tried to play with the transition duration a bit and none of them worked. Heres what Ive triedp  ol liTried to make the transition duration 0.5ms short than the value change interval. E.g. get new value every 500ms, set transition duration to be 450ms. Not only gives me stutter, but also make the entire transition lack significantly. li liTried to make the transition duration longer than the update interval out of despair, surprised that it worked... For a little while then start giving me stutter again.li liTried to make the transition duration the same as the update interval, same stutters. li ol  pstrongNow my question is How should I go about making the CSS3 transition smooth without stutter when the rotation value changes frequentlystrong Also, would switching to JavaScript animation alleviate this problem, like pausing the transition when the value changesp  pstrongSolutionstrongp  pReplace CSS3 transition with Javascript animation. I used Velocity.js for the animation.

Negative 1461 pso far this is the most awkward thing Ive come about.

Negative 1461 pI am developing desktop application in visual studio 2008 using c for a machine which cuts the material in two parts using laser. At the electronics hand my friend uses a QT programming language to made a library for serial communication and axis handling. As we know QT programming uses a MinGW compiler while C uses a VC. There is many ways to use QT Library in C like using Qt MSVC addin you can compile library in Visual Studios compiler, I have tried and also got succeeded in this, but there are some limitations of QT library to execute functionality like threads,etc on MSVC compiler. So now I think, if my C application able to compile on MinGw compiler using Visual Studio IDE then it becomes very easy to execute all QT library functionality on windows platform through my code.p  pIn simple words, Is there is any way to change the compiler of Visual Studio to MinGW for compilation successfully code of both different platform p

Negative 1461 pOK, so I understand delegates.  I am perplexed in a language design sense that in some recent Swift work I have encountered delegates that can only be implemented with an override qualifier.  Specifically controlTextDidEndEditing as NSTextFieldDelegate of a NSTextField UI element.  Yes, this is OS X dev work, not IOS.p  pWhen implementing this delegate Xcode insists on an override qualifier for the func.  If it is a delegate function, then what codefunctionality up the hierarchy am I overriding and should I care  Inserting super.controlTextDidEndEditing in the implementation simply led to an infinite loop.  My comprehension perhaps faultyincomplete of a delegate has been that it defines a signature that the implementation matches.p  pThe context is test panel with an TextField and Label dropped into a ViewController, a trivial test exercise.  The only scenario that I can arrive at is that somewhere in the hierarchy above the ViewController some other class is already implementing controlTextDidEndEditing, which leads to the override requirement as soon as I try to implement it, which implies that I am destroying some existing level of functionality.  I did experiment with subclassing NSTextField with the same override required result.p  pCan anyone further my education by explaining the ins and outs of this p  pThanks,p  pAlan.p

Negative 1461 pBefore anyone says, I have searched through for a suitable answer for my issue but cannot find anything specific enough so I thought Id ask it.p  pBasically I am trying to select a bunch of data for a report of people who have made loan applications to a website, but there are two different types unsecured and guarantee. I need to place an IFNULL statement in the WHERE clause so that I ONLY use that clause if a certain other field isnt null.p  pHere is my statementp  precodeSELECT      la.lmsloanapplicationid,     la.created,     la.updated,     la.loanamount,     la.loanterm,     la.loandocumentfee,     la.brokerreference,     la.brokersubreference,     laa.firstname,     laa.surname,     laa.dob,     laa.email,     laa.mobilenumber,     laaAd.addresspostcode,     lag.firstname,     lag.surname,     lag.dob,     lag.email,     lag.mobilenumber,     lagAd.addresspostcode,     lagAd.housingstatus FROM     loanapplication AS la         JOIN     loanapplicationapplicant AS laa ON la.id  laa.loanapplication         LEFT JOIN     loanapplicationguarantor AS lag ON la.id  lag.loanapplication         JOIN     loanapplicationaddress AS laaAd ON laaAd.loanapplicationapplicant  laa.id         LEFT JOIN     loanapplicationaddress AS lagAd ON lagAd.loanapplicationguarantor  lag.id WHERE     la.status  signaturegiven         AND  IFNULLlag.firstname,             lag.status  signaturegiven         AND laa.status  signaturegiven         AND  IFNULLlag.firstname,             lagAd.currentaddress  1         AND laaAd.currentaddress  1 ORDER BY la.updated DESC LIMIT 10000 codepre  pAs you can see, I have attempted to use the IFNULLs although in a negated way, which I assume works but all I get is duplicate row results and not the result set I really want.p  pBasically, I need to use the where clause lag.status  signaturegiven and lagAd.currentaddress  1 ONLY if the lag.firstname field is NOT null i.e. there is a guarantor name otherwise the status wont exist, and therefore the results of unsecured loans will not show. Hope Im explaining this well enoughp  pIn summary, I need to show all loan information, unsecured and guaranteed, and use a negated IFNULL in order to determine when the WHERE clause is to be taken into consideration.p  pAny help appreciatedp  pThank you in advance Michaelp

Negative 1461 pI know there are some tools out there for using Pure DataPd within Python, so you can program and use Pd without using its GUI. I was wondering if anyone has tried the opposite. I want to send sequencing information into Python and process it with my Python script. Then I want to send the information to Pd. p  pSo far I have written sequences to text files using the [msgfile] object in Pd. These can be opened and manipulated with Python but this involves switching to IDLE and manually running the program, writing out to a text file again, and finally reading from the file in Pd. If Pd can execute Python scripts this would save me the effort of writing my own objects in C or C or switching between programs and manually running my scripts.p

Negative 1461 pThis is more of a sanity check than it is a question, but anyways...p  pI have an OAuth 2 provider that issues JSON Web Tokens as Access Tokens that are signed with certificates. I like the idea of a JSON web token in that they provided a sense of authentication by using a certificate to sign the token and then pass that to a client. For rich clients that can download and validate a public certificate against a CA, this is a nicety because it lets the client and service use a trusted third party.p  pIf Im in a browser I can still validate the token with an x.509 certificate, but there doesnt seem to be any way to validate the certificate with a CA, there doesnt seem to be any security value added by using JSON web Tokens for browser based applications. Anyone that could intercept the token could rewrite and resign it...p  pAm I missing something p

Negative 1461 pLet me explain my setup since it sounds a little absurd.p  pI have a third party application that contains native libraries I need to use in spark. So I set LDLIBRARYPATH to point to the lib directory. No problem.p  pI have a DataFrame implementation that was done in scala using some of the third party native libraries I mentioned above. The DataFrame was built using SBT and has some dependencies from the the same third party jars.p  pThe third party program is written in java but has native c calls within it.p  pNow, heres the error that I am gettingp  pjava.lang.UnsatisfiedLinkError with one of the native c calls.p  pI think the problem has to do something with the DataFrame jar that I created using third party dependencies and the fact that its written in scala and I am trying to use it in java. I know scala code gets compiled to bytecode and should work with the JVM but I dont know enough to diagnose this error. strongThe reason why I think this is because when I run spark just using the third party application, it works great. No linking errors, no complains, even though it makes the same native c library callsstrong. But when I add the DataFrame jar, it fails and gives me the error above. The error happens specifically in the DataFrame code.p  pSo what is happening when a jar, compiled from scala code, calls code that uses native librariesp

Negative 1461 pIm working on migrating a Java project from using log4j 1.2 for logging to using log4j 2. p  plog4j 1.x has a class a hrefhttpslogging.apache.orglog4j1.2apidocs relnofollowcodeorg.apache.log4j.DailyRollingFileAppendercodea which is mentioned in my projects log4j.properties configuration file.

Negative 1461 pIm having a lot of issues finding a solution to my problem, Ive found what is essentially this question  already on stackoverflow a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions23437524howtodynamicallyupdateamatplotlibtablecelltextHow to dynamically update a matplotlib table cell texta , but there arent any answers to that question. p  pIve written a program that takes temperature data and creates an animated heatmap using the plt.imshow and FuncAnimation commands and using .setarray to update the values for each timestep. This part works flawlessly for my application, I also put a data table using the plt.table command in a subplot and I would like to display the max and min temps for each timestep as the heatmap is being displayed. This is where my issues come in, I cant seem to find a method for updating the table thats in the subplot. Ive tried updating the tablevals list in the update function which didnt update the displayed table, Ive tried putting the plotting code into the update equation which works for a few timesteps before it slows to a crawl since its trying to draw 20 tables overtop each other, I tried using the plt.clf command and it wipes out the entire plot instead of just the table subplot. p  pIve also tried setting .setanimatedTrue after creating my table but that just results in a blank subplot, and I cant seem to find documentation on how to use this feature. p  pIn any case, my question is how should I code this if I want to update the subplot table each time step using FuncAnimation. Im not including a code snippet since I dont know how to approach this problem yet. p

Negative 1461 pI have seen some cautionary posts on using multivalue fields with many values a few thousand that are used for analysis. In my use case I have need of documents that would possess multivalued fields with many values that would NOT require any analysis, and is not the field thats searched on. It would just be dumb data so to speak. Would this pose any problem for Solr Looking around on the web most of the answers I have seen focus on very old versions of Solr so I hesitate to put too much stock in them. Any thoughts of the viability of this would be appreciated.p

Negative 1461 pI have an MVC app that authenticates users with their microsoft accounts using the default options set for Oauth 2.0 on an MVC 5 app. When logging in for the first time, lets say on firefox using my account credentials, it asks for associating a username to this email and it is working perfectly the user infos are stored in the database and so on. The problem is when I change browsers and use the same email to log in, I am then asked again to associate another username to the same email account and end up having two different usernames for the same Microsoft account.  I understand that Oauth2 is now supposed to provide identification and authorization and that it relies on grants. Thus, I think the problem could be caused by these lines since cookies are proper to each browserp  precodeapp.UseCookieAuthenticationnew CookieAuthenticationOptions                              AuthenticationType  DefaultAuthenticationTypes.ApplicationCookie,                 LoginPath  new PathStringAccountLogin,                 Provider  new CookieAuthenticationProvider                                       Enables the application to validate the security stamp when the user logs in.

Negative 1461 pIm trying to implement paging in my app on google app engine, using the python datastore api. My requirement is to display user data using infinite list. My current implementation is using cursor with something like thisp  precode    retrieve currentcursor     alldata  mydata.all.ordercreated     data  alldata.fetchlimit10, startcursorcurrentcursor     currentcursor  alldata.cursor     save currentcursor codepre  pFrom my understanding, cursor works on queried resultset, which saves the time of the subsequent queries but not the first one, am I correctp  pMy concern is that if we have large amount of data, the first time query will still be too slow. To make the first time query faster, my thought is that, instead of querying all data, Ill break the query into multiple smaller ones, such as setting a filter with codecreated gt, certaindatecode and using cursor to fetch results within each set.p  pHowever, the drawback is Ill have to maintain the codecertaindatecode on my own and if not choosing it wisely, it might cost me with lots of database read.p  pSo my question is, do I understand the cursor correctly Also, are there better ways to use google datastore to support this or any suggestions in general to implement this Thanksp
