Positive 23506 pI had been happily using djangotables2 but I decided I wanted to transpose the table so the header row was the first column and then the rows were columns. This is pretty well described all over the place, but not so much how.

The content of the model doesnt seem to be relevant to so Ill make that simple.p  precodeclass Productmodels.model     manufacturer  models.CharField     model  models.CharField     feature1  models.BooleanField  objects  DataFrameManager codepre  pThats over simpilfied, but you get the point.

I can also use codehtmltable  flipped.tohtmlcode and then pass codehtmltablecode to a view and get an HTML table in my view. p  pstrongemBUTemstrong, what do I need to do with that dataframe object I get codeflippedcode in order to get it back to a queryset or a Table so I can continue to use djangotables2 to display the data I had TemplateColumns and Meta class settings as well so Id like to see how that all fits together if possible, so Id prefer a path that still allows that.p  pThanks so much, I hope my question was clear enough.p

But when they enter matching passwords and resubmit the form a second time, the csrftoken contains the token value but requestcsrftoken is blank.  This was confirmed by the fact that request.POST[csrfmiddlewaretoken] is not in the request.POST dictionary when the user resubmits the form.  I dont understand why this is happening.p  pThis form worked perfectly well in Django 1.6 but its stopped working in 1.8 or possibly 1.7.  I looked through the 1.7 and 1.8 release notes and didnt see any changes to the CSRF functionality.  I also read the template docs that pertain to CSRF and didnt see anything new there.  Doing an online search on this error didnt turn up anything either.p  pI suspect that some of you will suggest that I use the djangoregistrationredux library.  I dont think I can use it due to my registration workflow.  You see, after the user registers on this form, theyre redirected first to a page when they enter their user profile, then to a page where they can upload a photo, and then to a page to review and approve their profile and photo.  After that, theyre forwarded to my payment processor.  Theyre only truly registered with a valid account if my payment processor tells me their payment method has been approved.p  pThanks.p

Negative 23506 pI have implemented a hrefhttpwww.semdesigns.comProductsPARLANSEindex.html relnofollowPARLANSEa, a language under MS Windows that uses cactus stacks to implement parallel programs.  The stack chunks are allocated on a perfunction basis and are emjustem the right size to handle local variables, expression temp pushespops, and calls to libraries including stack space for the library routines to work in.  Such stack frames can be as small as 32 bytes in practice and often are.p  pThis all works great unless the code does something stupid and  causes a hardware trap... at which point emWindowsem appears to insist on pushing the entire x86 machine context on the stack. This is some 500 bytes if you include the FPMMXetc. registers, which it does.   Naturally, a 500 byte push on a 32 byte stack smashes things it should not.  The hardware pushes a few words  on a trap, but not the entire context.p  p[EDIT 11272012 See a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comq9461559120163this for emmeasuredem details on the rediculous amount of stack Windows actually pushesa]p  pCan I get Windows to store the exception context block someplace else e.g., to a location specific to a thread Then the software could take the exception hit on the thread and process it without overflowing my small stack frames.p  pI dont think this is possible, but I thought Id ask a much larger audience.   Is there an OS standard callinterface that can cause this to happenp  pIt would be trivial to do in the OS, if I could con MS into letting my process optionally define a context storage location, contextp, which is initialized to enable the current legacy behavior by default.

If it has a chance of generating a trap e.g., divide by zero, or we are debugging possible bad pointer deref, etc., add enough space to the stack frame for the FP context.

So we have a workable solution, but it complicates debugging]p  pEDIT Aug 25 Ive managed to get this story to a Microsoft internal engineer who has the authority apparantly to find out who in MS might actually care.  There might be faint hope for a solution.p  pEDIT Sept 14 MS Kernal Group Architect has heard the story and is sympathetic. He said MS will consider a solution like the one proposed but unlikely to be in a service pack.  Might have to wait for next version of Windows.  Sigh...I might grow old...p  pEDIT Sept 13, 2010 1 year later.  No action on Microsofts part.  My latest nightmare does taking a trap running a 32 bit process on Windows X64, push the entire X64 context on the stack before the interrupt handler fakes pushing a 32 bit context  Thatd be even larger twice as many integer registers twice as wide, twice as many SSE registersp  pEDIT February 25, 2012 1.5 years have gone by...  No reaction on Microsofts part.  I guess they just dont care about my kind of parallelism.  I think this is a disservice to the community the big stack model used by MS under normal circumstance limits the amount of parallel computations one can have alive at any one instant by eating vast amounts of VM.  The PARLANSE model will let one have an application with a million live grains in various states of runningwaiting this really occurs in some of our applications where a 100 million node graph is processed in parallel.  The PARLANSE scheme can do this with about 1Gb of RAM, which is pretty manageable. If you tried that with MS 1Mb big stacks youd need 1012 bytes of VM just for the stack space and Im pretty sure Windows wont let you manage a million threads.p  pEDIT April 29, 2014  4 years have gone by.   emI guess MS just doesnt read SO.em  Ive done enough engineering on PARLANSE so we only pay the price of large stack frames during debugging or when there are FP operations going on, so weve managed to find very practical ways to live with this.  MS has continued to disappoint the amount of stuff pushed on the stack by various versions of Windows seems to vary considerably and egregiously above and beyond the need for just the hardware context.  Theres some hint that some of this variability is caused by nonMS products sticking e.g. antivirus sticking their nose in the exception handling chain why cant they do that from outside my address space  Any, we handle all this by simply adding a large slop factor for FPdebug traps, and waiting for the inevitable MS system in the field that exceeds that amount.p
Negative 23506 pIm working on a php script to take an existing csv file well call this one the template and open it in a page and populate editable text fields with its data between 1 and 50 timesuser decides how many, which once edited to the users wishes, can then all be saved into a single combined csv file, separate from the template.p  pI included a link to a diagram of how i need this to work.

Negative 23506 pI have a class that has a readonly collection property  Its a list of extender providers that have been applied to the control.p  pIve implemented a simple property descriptor for the collection so that the property can be expanded in the property grid to examine each entry.p  pWhen I select an extender provider and set it to false, I remove it from the collection. The GetProperties method of the type converter is requeried and the property grid refreshes.p  pHowever, when I set an extender provider to true, and thus add it to the collection, GetProperties is not requeried.p  pSomehow, the property grid is making a distinction between adding to and removing from the collection.

Negative 23506 pWith most Linux distributions dropping gzip and bzip2 in favor of LZMA2 for compressing their packages, and many open source implementations for many platforms, I wonder Shouldnt we lay DEFLATE and the code.zipcode format which unfortunately got bastardized over and over to rest, and move on to other, modern ways of distributing our source packagesp  pGNU tar supports the codeJcode switch, which uses codexzcode another LZMA2 compressor as filterp  precode tar cJf foo.tar.xz foo codepre  pHowever, I tend to use code7zcode p7zip implementation and its friend code7zacode under Linux for creating archives. I still use the avoid tarbombs paradigm, when creating archives, meaning theres a directory in that archives, so extracting from commandline does not result in spilling out files in the current directory this is standard emmodus operandiem on Linux with things like codetarcode, but it seems to be much less of a commen thing to do under Windows.p  pAnyways, it seems due to the use in packages Fedora RPMs and Ubuntu DEBs, for instance, as well as filters for tools like codetarcode, that LZMA2 is the next best thing coming to use after bzip2. It has a great compression rate beats bzip2 by far in standard settings and is very fast at it, too compression is slightly slower than gzip, p  pI did some benchmarking myself, but Id like to turn the spot on some more extensive Benchmarksp  ul liRating based benchmark at a hrefhttpcompressionratings.comsort.cgiratingsum.full13nrcompressionratings.comali liEfficiency based benchmark at a hrefhttpwww.maximumcompression.comdatasummarymf2.phpmaximumcompression.comali ul  pNow, youll notice, that a hrefhttp7zip.org7zipa, which is the reference implementation, does not appear on first place. However Freearc uses its own code.arccode format, which is not really cross platform capable and not compatible to the emoldem ARC from the 80s. nanozip isnt open source, which kind of a downturn, but its the algorithm that counts, not the archiverp  pAnyways, now that performance with 7zip and its derivative implementations a hrefhttptukaani.orgxzxza, is not an issue any more, and the compression ratio is speaking for itself, I feel like distributing my source packages as code.7zcode or code.tar.xzcode archives. However, I have two hurdles in front of me, which I dont seem able to takep  ol lipstrongAdvocates of WinRARstrong.  Dont get me wrong, I hold no grudge against WinRAR or its users, its just that I cant really make RARs on Linux, and theres no need to, since we have free LZMA2 tools. And as I said, since becoming an integral part of distribution packages, its available on any modern Distribution. Since it takes about the same time to make a code.7zcode than a code.rarcodeand LZMA2 files are generally smaller, I dont see why not use 7zip.pli lipstrongtar archives have to be zip or bzip2, no exceptionsstrong. This is a hard one. Why are so many people impressed with gzip Even bzip2 doesnt see much usage most of the time. Granted, gzip is fast, a good point when it comes to ondemand compression such as in web servers, or when creating large mirrorbackups. But what about distributing software LZMA2 is emveryem asymmetrical. While compression takes its time, decompression is blazingly fast.pli ol  pOK, now here comes my questionp  pSince LZMA2 is arguably the next better compression algorithm, why are people not jumping onto the train Why do people still use WinRAR, which is proprietary, has a worse compression ratio, and is not ported to Linux except codeunrarcode, but you obviously cant create archives with that. Why are Tarballs still mostly gzipedp  pIs there no way on how to convince people to move on to a newer, reliable archiving format, thats not only crossplatform, but also free When I give someone a file ending in code.7zcode, they tend not to know what to do with it, will this ever changep  pOh, and heres the little benchmark I did myself.

Negative 23506 pIm attempting to make a simple homebrew game engineframework in android. I have the engine as a library project that handles all of the graphics rendering, game activity, and whatnot. Essentially, the library project has a class GameMain which has a background image, an array of drawables, and a few functions the most important is a run function. The projects that use this library extend this class with their own unique run function. The idea is that games that use the engine start with their own activity, launch the GameActivity from the library, and pass their unique GameMain child object into the library, which should run the unique run method thanks to polymorphism.p  pGetting this to work, however, has been a struggle. I originally attempted to make the GameMain Serializable, which didnt appear to work. Im now attempting to make it a Parcelable, but it does not appear to run the child objects run function when called from the library. Im wondering, are Parcelable objects actually capable of sending Object methods across activities Am I going about this the wrong way, or am I just having some other weird bug I have not uncoveredp

Negative 23506 pAlthough I will be using Ruby on Rails, this is a general questions about the best way to model a database and design a custom access control system for a CMS. So it does not matter what languagedb. I would be happy to hear input from all experts.p  pMy problem I am in the early process of developing an online tutorial system for a local university. The idea is that students will be able to obtain extra help online alongside their main class material.p  pBasics    Planning to use an existing CMS to manage content basically web pages.p  ul lipContent is structured by course, topic, subtopic, etc.pli lipA registered student can login and see relevant content so only see course material that they signed up for.pli lipAs student follows content heshe is required to do some exercises.pli lipThere are tutors that check student progress and provide further assistance if needed.  So exercise results are stored alongside student records for tutors to review.pli lipStudent responses to exercises are not graded, but answers are provided upon submission.pli lipstrongMajor issuestrong some profs wish to coerce students to do the exercises before the rest of content becomes available. Other profs wish to set times when content chunks get released. Or it could be a combination of both.pli ul  pThe timed content release is easy to do. But I have no idea how to model and design the conditional content release. In this case conditions being the student progress completed exercises.p  pTo illustrate, I have this contentp  precode    1. Calculus      1.1 Limits       1.1.1 Basic principles        1.1.2 More basics with exercise       1.1.3 Answers to previous questions      1.2 Derivatives        1.2.1 Intro        1.2.2 Sample problemswith exercises        1.2.3 Answers        1.2.3 More content ....      1.9 More calculus         1.9.3 Some other content that is available when all previous exercises are completed     2. Physics     3. Chem  codepre  pExample Content for Calculus should only be available once student is enrolled in Calculus class. Content for 1.1.3, 1.2, etc should only become available once exercises on 1.1.2 are completed. So its kind of a chained reaction.p  pSo as you can see there is some structure, but mostly a lot of dependencies. So Im wondering what would be appropriate way to model this in the database, and how does one design access control for such a system.p  pHas any one encountered a similar problem Any ideas, insight, references would be most welcome.p  pA huge thank you.p

Negative 23506 pWe have a Rest API that requires client certificate authentication.  The API is used by this collection of python scripts that a user can run.  To make it so that the user doesnt have to enter their password for their client certificate every time they run one of the scripts, weve created this broker process in java that a user can startup and run in the background which holds the users certificate password in memory we just have the javax.net.ssl.keyStorePassword property set in the JVM. The scripts communicate with this process and the process just forwards the Rest API calls to the server adding the certificate credentials.  p  pTo do the IPC between the scripts and the broker process were just using a socket.  The problem is that the socket opens up a security risk in that someone could use the Rest API using another persons certificate by communicating through the broker process port on the other persons machine.  Weve mitigated the risk somewhat by using java security to only allow connections to the port from localhost.  I think though someone in theory could still do it by remotely connecting to the machine and then using the port.   Is there a way to further limit the use of the port to the current windows user  Or maybe is there another form of IPC I could use that can do authorization using the current windows userp  pstrikeWere using Java for the broker process just because everyone on our team is much more familiar with Java than python but it could be rewritten in python if that would help.strikep  pstrongEditstrong  Just remembered the other reason for using java for the broker process is that we are stuck with using python v2.6 and at this version https with client certificates doesnt appear to be supported at least not without using a 3rd party library. p

Negative 23506 pImmutable objects are great because they require no special care or feeding in multithreaded applications.  However many objects fall just short of being naturally immutable.  For example, an order which is submitted, processed, and is assigned a permanent ID once the order is filled.  The ID cannot be given at the time the order is created and submitted, but arrives later or perhaps never.p  pPossible solutionsp  ol liAssign an additional unique ID at the time of order creation.  Then, when the permanent order filled ID comes, store it in a Map.  So the order class would be immutable.  Then, if the Map key did not exist, wed know the order was not filled yet.  Should the Map be a static class fieldli liAnother solution is to make the permanent ID field mutable an apply the appropriate synchronization.  Additionally we could limit the ID to be set only once in the objects lifetime.li ol  pAre these solutions reasonable  Any other ideas  Thanks.p

Negative 23506 pWhat would be the advantages and disadvantages of implementing a web application with the following architecturep  pSimple server that simply serves JSON responses of data, and HTML with templates to be rendered in the client. The client side be a javascript MVC application that receives and caches HTML the templates and asks for data in JSON format as needed. The js is the heart and logic of the application, implementing all the behaviour and interaction.p  pIn this particular scenario, the server would ask as a repository of data and as a server of HTML templates. The client receives the templates and caches them for later using offline storage, why not rendering them with the JSON data in the browser itself.p  pI can see some upsides to thisp  ul liThe browser only requests just the necessary data and templates, making it work with a very low bandwidth. Caching the templates is a big plus.li liThe server is quite simple, and may even be implemented in javascript using Node.js to allow for a graceful fallback for browsers that have javascript disabled by rendering the templates in the server and sending the generated html in the response.li ul  pand some downsidesp  ul liMore requests are made as templates and data are requested separatelyli liIn a bare bones application of this idea, it doesnt work if the user has javascript disabled.li ul  pIve been thinking about this for a while, and I dont know how crazy this idea is, and if there are current implementations of this, or even if this has a name. Any extra advantages or disadvantages Any existing implementationsp  pFeel free to close it if this idea does indeed have a name and a question exists about it.p  pIf I had the rep, Id make this a community wiki, but I cant.p

Negative 23506 pI havent really used bitwise enums before, and I just want to make sure my testing is correct. I am most interested in testing for the values None and All. We receive data from a webservice that utilises this enum to categorise certain pieces of the data. Given that, I am assuming that nether None nor All would ever be combined with any other value. p  pGiven the following bitwise enum definitionp  precode[System.FlagsAttribute] public enum TrainingComponentTypes  int              None  0,         AccreditedCourse  1,         Qualification  2,         Unit  4,         SkillSet  8,         UnitContextualisation  16,         TrainingPackage  32,         AccreditedCourseModule  64,         All  127,      codepre  pI read the following quote on a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibrarysystem.flagsattribute.aspxthis MSDN sitea about FlagAttributesp  blockquote   pUse None as the name of the flag   enumerated constant whose value is   zero. You cannot use the None   enumerated constant in a bitwise AND   operation to test for a flag because   the result is always zero. However,   you can perform a logical, not a   bitwise, comparison between the   numeric value and the None enumerated   constant to determine whether any bits   in the numeric value are set.p blockquote  pDoes a stronglogical comparisonstrong in this instance refer to a normal equality test for enums  For examplep  precodeTrainingComponentTypes tct  TrainingComponentTypes.None  if tct  TrainingComponentTypes.None   ...  codepre  pFor a strongbitwise comparisonstrong, I am performing the followingp  precode TrainingComponentTypes tct  TrainingComponentTypes.AccreditedCourse  TrainingComponentTypes.Qualification  TrainingComponentTypes.TrainingPackage  Assert.IsTruetct amp TrainingComponentTypes.AccreditedCourse  TrainingComponentTypes.AccreditedCourse, Expected AccreditedCourse as part the enum   Assert.IsFalsetct amp TrainingComponentTypes.SkillSet  TrainingComponentTypes.SkillSet, Found unexpected SkillSet as part the enum codepre  pLastly, when testing for all, I have tried both a logical, and bitwise comparison, and they both return the same. Should I be using one over the other here For examplep  precodeTrainingComponentTypes tct  TrainingComponentTypes.All  Assert.IsTruetct amp TrainingComponentTypes.All  TrainingComponentTypes.All, Expected All as part the enum Assert.IsTruetct  TrainingComponentTypes.All, Expected All as part the enum  The follow also pass the assertion for a value of All Assert.IsTruetct amp TrainingComponentTypes.Qualification  TrainingComponentTypes.Qualification, Expected Qualification as part the enum Assert.IsTruetct amp TrainingComponentTypes.TrainingPackage  TrainingComponentTypes.TrainingPackage, Expected TrainingPackage as part the enum codepre  pSo in summary, Id like to know the following about Bitwise enumsp  ol liIs my understanding of a logical comparison correct given my example above   li liIs the way I am performing a bitwise comparison correct   li liWhat is the right way to handle the All value bitwise or logical. I am not sure if wed ever receive a value where All was combined with other TrainingComponentTypes. I cant see why we would, but then, you never know   li liAm I right in assuming that switch statements basically shouldnt be used for bitwise enums given none is appears to be a special case and requires a logical comparisonli ol  pThanks, Chrisp

Negative 23506 pI have an existing ActiveX  COM component that has been working well for some time now. This ActiveX component was initially designed to be used by one client application per machine. However, now there is a need to extend this ActiveX component to be used by more than 1 client application in the same PC.p  pI know that the very reason why COM is in place is reusability and that there are ways to manage this, such as reference count etc. However my issue is different. Please read on...p  pEvery client application of mine if different, and these client applications act as standalone applications  in the sense that they are installed and uninstalled as individual applications. They each carry a copy of this ActiveX component and install it in its own installation directory. Every client app has its own copy of this ActiveX component that it installs, uses and uninstalls.p  pGiven below are the steps of what basically happens. Step 4 below is the actual Issuep  ol lipThe first time I install a client application X, since it uses COM, the installer registers the COM component and this creates an entry a typelib entry in the registry with the UUID as defined in the IDL and .rgs. pli lipIf I install another client app Y, before uninstalling client app X, the installer of the Y updates the typelibs win32 value with the the path to the ActiveX component in Ys current directory. pli lipWhen I uninstall the client application X, it removes this typelib entry from registry.pli lipSo at this point if I try to uninstall app Y, it fails because the typelib entry is missing. Xs uninstaller has already removed this entry.pli ol  pTo resolve this issue, I am trying to bypass using type libraries or use alternate ways if possible to use an ActiveX component without the issue I am facing now.p  pThe issue has come down to this  To have different typelibrary entries for different client applications, but for the same ActiveX component.p  pCan someone guide me and suggest a good, elegant solutionp

Negative 23506 pYou see this in iPhone apps like Gilt. The user scrolls a view, and a subview apparently sticks to one edges as the rest of the scrollView slides underneath. That is, there is a text box or whatever in the scrollView, that as the scrollView hits the top of the view, then sticks there as the rest of the view continues to slide.p  pSo, there are several issues. First, one can determine via scrollViewDidScroll during normal scrolling when the view of interest is passing or reappearing. There is a fair amount of granularity here  the differences between delegate calls can be a hundred of points or more. That said, when you see the view approach the top of the scrollView, you turn on a second copy of the view statically displayed under the scrollView top. I have not coded this, but it seems like it will lack a real stick look  the view will first disappear then reappear.p  pSecond, if one does a setContentOffsetanimated, one does not get the delegate messages Gilt does not do this. So, how do you get the callbacks in this case Do you use KVO on scroll.layer.presentationLayer.bounds p

Negative 23506 pI am creating a form which allows the user to choose an email cover text template the text for which is contained in a div, who to send the email to an input box, and other options. When the user picks who to send the email to, the cover text which contains receiver information is updated with AJAX to reflect that choice. If the user puts in an invalid receiver, than the part of the cover text that displays the receiver is hidden. When the form is submitted, I want the cover text contained in a div to be sent to the server also.p  pI can think of 3 ways to do this while ensuring that the receiver part of the cover text will only be submitted if it is visible.p  ol liUse AJAX to set a server variable to the visible part of the cover textli liSet a hidden form value to the visible part of the cover textli liActually add and subtract the HTML of the receiver info, dont just hideshow itli ol  pWhich of these sounds like the best option Or is some other way a better way to do itp

Negative 23506 pI have a shared memory pool from which many different threads may request an allocation. Requesting an allocation from this will occur a LOT in every thread, however the amount of threads is likely to be small, often with only 1 thread running. I am not sure which of the following ways to handle this are better. p  pUltimately I may need to implement both and see which produces more favorable results... I also fear that even thinking of 2 may be premature optimization at this point as I dont actually have the code that uses this shared resource written yet. But the problem is so darn interesting that it continues to distract me from the other work.p  p1 Create a mutex and have a thread attempt to lock it before obtaining the allocation, then unlocking it.p  p2 Have each thread register a request slot, when it needs an allocation it puts the request in the slot, then blockswhile result  NULL  usleep  waiting for the request slot to have a result. A single thread continuously iterates request slots making the allocations and assigning them to the result in the request slot.p  pNumber 1 is the simple solution, but a single thread could potentially hog the lock if the timing is right. The second is more complex, but ensures fairness among threads when pulling from the resource. However it still blocks the requesting threads, and if there are many threads the iteration could burn cycles without doing any actual allocations until it finds a request to fulfill.p  pNOTE C on Linux using pthreadsp

Negative 23506 pIs it possible to pull a user object from any controller For me it seems to only work in my users controller.p  pIm trying to render a form that a user can use to update the details they signed up to the website with e.g. names, email, password etc. The problem is the page wont load it is called using .load jquery function.

Negative 23506 pI have a JSF page where users can enter their car into my database. The form has three input fieldsp  ul liManufacturerli liModelli liRegistrationli ul  pThe codeManufacturercode and codeModelcode field are both autocompletion fields. In order to complete the codeModelcode field, I need to know what value the user selected in the codeManufacturercode field prior to submitting the form. To that end, I set up an AJAX call to inform the managed bean of the selected valuep  precodeltpautoComplete idmanufacturer                 minQueryLength3                 completeMethodcarController.complete                 forceSelectiontruegt    ltpajax eventitemSelect            listenercarController.manufacturerSelected gt ltpautoCompletegt codepre  pAnd in the managed beanp  precodepublic void manufacturerSelectedSelectEvent se      manufacturer  se.getObject.toString  codepre  pThe autocomplete field and handler method for the model look about the same, with slighly different values.p  pTo retain the codemanufacturercode value across the multiple XHR requests, I have set the bean to codeConversationScopedcode and begin the conversation in a codePostConstructcode annotated methodp  precodeNamed ConversationScoped public class CarController implements Serializable   Inject private Conversation conversation  PostConstruct private void init      conversation.begin  codepre  pWhat I would expect is the bean getting only instantiated once for the page because the conversation has not been ended yet, and retaining the value in the codemanufacturercode field. This, however, does not hold true, and the bean is instantiated again for each XHR request, causing the codemanufacturercode field to be codenullcode as well. Setting a breakpoint in the codePostConstructcode method revealed that it is in fact getting called and so is the codemanufacturerSelectedcode method.p  pI suspect this has something to do with the fact that I am not manually propagating the conversation ID but the documentation says that this ID should automatically be propagated with any faces request. Is this in fact true, and, does that mean that XHR requests are not necessarily faces requestsp  pstrongEditstrong Setting breakpoints at various locations in the bean has revealed that each XHR request has a new bean codeconversation.getIdcode keeps changing so I am obviously not propagating the ID right. How would one propagate the ID with pajax and where can I get it with ELp
Negative 23506 pIf you look a hrefhttproseanneconner.tumblr.com relnofollowherea, you will see upon loading the page there is a DIV at the top. It is called content with contentcontainer wrapped around it and finally, page around that. If you click the bottom left or right arrows you will see other DIVs with the same tags but they are properly vertically aligned. The closest I got to maybe fixing it is when I inspected the first carousel element the one at the top and saw it was indeed height100 like it should. However, if you go to the right or left and inspect the other DIVs they also have height100 When you uncheck height100 the DIV moves to the top. The only idea I have is that perhaps another DIV around page isnt letting page become height100 when first loading the page. Other than that Im 100 lost.p  pYou CANNOT look in the source code because with Tumblr themes you are creating the code separate for each post, so if you look at the source code from your perspective the code is not what it looks like on my end. The entire themes code is below P.S Text and Quote posts are the only posts that are vertically aligned, so please look at those. Im posting the entire code incase I have made a mistake that prevents height100 from loading.p  precodeltDOCTYPE html PUBLIC W3CDTD XHTML 1.0 TransitionalEN

Negative 23506 pIm trying to optimise my query. Basically I have an Department table and a document table. Each document belongs to a department and each document can be a specific type.p  pCurrently mu query looks like thisp  precodeSELECT  DepartmentID,         [Description]  DepartmentNo     DepartmentName  ,         hasInvoice  CASE WHEN EXISTSSELECT DocID FROM Document WHERE DepartmentID  Department.DepartmentID AND TypeID  1 gt 0 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END,         hasCreditNote  CASE WHEN EXISTSSELECT DocID FROM Document WHERE DepartmentID  Department.DepartmentID AND TypeID  2 gt 0 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END,         hasQuote  CASE WHEN EXISTSSELECT DocID FROM Document WHERE DepartmentID  Department.DepartmentID AND TypeID  3 gt 0 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END FROM  Department ORDER BY DepartmentName codepre  pThe problem I have is that for each lookup of the documents relating to the department by their type causes the query to rescan through the document table which makes things really slow. Is there a more optimised way of doing this Ive tried using a CTE, Doing a left join for each type. but it seems to make no impact to making the query faster.p  pWe have roughly 200000 documents, so its quite an important thing to get this query optimised.p  pThanksp

Negative 23506 pMy iOS application uses codeCoreDatacode to store many things, and codeNSUserDefaultscode to store other things that codeCoreDatacode would be overkill for.p  pIm going to simplify this so bear with me Note for the sake of this example lets use credit cards. When my application loads it displays a list of saved credit cards. Now, when each card is added it is assigned a number 110 lets call it codecardNumcode that stays with the card for the life of it. p  pSo we add one card and assign it 1. We add another card and assign it 2. Another... 3. We can set a default card that will be highlighted on launch by tapping it. What it does is saves the codecardNumcode as the codecDefaultcode to codeNSUserDefaultscode to keep track of it effectively setting card X as the default card. p  pcrude drawing of a table viewp  precodecDefault is 2  1  Card1  2  Card2 cDefault  3  Card3  4  Card4  codepre  pSo lets say we assign codecDefaultcode to 2 and then next week we delete that card. On deletion, I need to automatically assign one of the other cards to be a default card. p  pcrude drawing of table view AFTER card 2 is deleted  note how codecDefaultcode is still set...p  precodecDefault is still 2  1  Card1  3  Card3  4  Card4  codepre  pSo my question is how, upon deletion, to set another card as codecDefaultcode i.e if it was an array I would probably set the new default to the codecDefaultcode value of whatever card is at  codeindexPath.row0code but Im not sure if I can do that using codeCoreDatacodep  pPlease ask as many questions as you need to. I tried to explain this to the best of my abilities but if I was unclear on anything please ask me. p  pThank you so much in advance. Jamesp

Negative 23506 pIm a long time listener, but first time caller here Hoping you can help me with a core data questionp  pI am creating a custom business app for iPad that allows a user to fill out contracts commonly used in their business. There are four contracts with between 20 and 40 data fields each and they are all quite different, but there are a few 34 fields that are common to all four, such as Date Created and Vendor Name etc. p  pI need to display all the contracts together in a UITableView grouped style to show there are different types, and I need to be able to select a cell and display a detail view so the user can view and modify data on a specific contract.p  pMy research to date tells me I should use a parent entity entity A that lists the attributes common to all, and then child entities entity B, C, D, amp E representing each of the four contracts that have the attributes unique to them, and inherit the rest from entity A.p  pIs this the best way to structure this data model Bearing in mind that when I create a new instance of a contract it needs to be a standalone object with all its attributes plus that of the parent. If so, when Im generating cells for my tableView, do I fetch entity A and hope the rest come along also, or do I do separate fetch requests for each contract type and add to the table that way Conversely, if I want to create a new instance of a contract say entity B in my data model how would I go about thatp  pI hope Ive explained that well enough.

Negative 23506 pWith the announcement of the Google App Engines new pricing model, Ive realized my application will not be able to sustain itself due to the extremely high price of Google Datastore interactions.  Because it is a social game that relies on consistent and quick user input, this application simply requires far too many datstore interactions on a peruser basis to be viable even with memcache mediating common queries and operations.p  pFrom the research Ive done, it seems like the best solution would be for my team to migrate to a Cassandrabased database solution.  Ive looked at the various popular APIs like Hector and Pelops, but from my initial inspection it seems these are a little too lowlevel for what Im looking for.  Is there a Cassandra client API in Java that emulates the App Engines lowlevel Datstore API and uses the same Entity Groupproperty model  At the very least I would like the API to have the same Ancestor Entity concepts and maintain crossgroup transactions in the same manner.p  pemEDITem  To clarify, what Im really looking for is a Cassandra API that supports Transactions.  As far as I can understand, transactions in a NoSQL environment are difficult, if not impossible to implement without some hierarchical groupings of objects call them what you will, entities, tables, etc.  This seems to be why Hector does not implement them.p  pSo, my question is, what is the most popular Cassandra API that implements some form of transactional systems, preferably one that uses an GAElike Entity structurep

Negative 23506 pI have a program which uses many hidden GUI components. For example, all the menu items, and the printer dialogscomponents which take up at least 50ms alone. In total, Im guessing around 300ms or 40 of the startup of the whole program is thanks to all the hidden stuff.p  pWhat I would love to do is create these after the main immediately visible GUI is drawn similar advice was mentioned in a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions6885041howtoloadawinformsappquicklythis threada. However, the Visual Studio editor will obviously revert it back to normal after I addchange elements in the GUI designer, and keep creation of all the GUI widgets back together again in the codeInitializeComponentcode function.p  pIs it possible to achieve what I want, perhaps by cordoning off particular GUI widgets which Visual Studio isnt allowed to touch, whilst leaving the rest for VS to play with This way, Id get full performance without sacrificing the convenience of the GUI designer. Or maybe theres a better wayp
Negative 23506 pSo Im doing Project Euler because dear gods do I need to practice writing code, and also my math skills are rusty as something very rusty. Thusly Project Euler. Im sure most here have already seen or heard of the problem, but Ill put it here just for completenessp  pThe prime factors of 13195 are 5, 7, 13 and 29. What is the largest prime factor of the number 600851475143 p  pFor this, Ive written two functionsp  precodefrom math import sqrt  def isprimen     if n  1         return False     elif n  2         return True     elif n  2  0         return False     for x in range3, roundsqrtn1, 2         if n  x  0             return False     else         return True codepre  pThis just checks any fed number for primality. Its working as intended as far as I know, but now that Ive said that I grow unsure. Anyway, it checks for special cases first 1 never prime, 2 prime or if its divisible by 2 not prime. If none of the special cases happen, it runs a general primality test. p  pThis is my factorization codep  precodedef factorizationn    factor  2    x  3    while True        if n  x  0            if isprimex                factor  x                n  n  x                if n  1                    return factor            else                return factor        x  2 codepre  pAnd this is definitely not working as intended. It is, sadly, working for the particular value of the Project Euler problem, but it doesnt work for, say, 100. Im unsure what I need to do to fix this what happens is that if its a number like 100, it will correctly find the first 5 225, but after that will loop around and set x  7, which will make the entire thing loop infinitely because the answer is 2255. Would recursion help here I tried it, but it didnt get any prettier it would still go into an endless loop for some numbers. Im unsure how to solve this now.p

In general case, when one object take another one by const reference, it suggest that temporary object can be given there.

Negative 23506 pDuring an interview I was requested among other things to implement the following functionp  precodeint StrPrintFchar psz, const char szFmt, ... codepre  psimilar to codesprintfcode, except instead of the alreadyallocated storage the function must allocate it itself, and return in the codepszcode variable. Moreover, codepszcode may point to an alreadyallocated string on the heap, which may potentially be used during the formatting.

Id never ask for help without trying things myself first. I saw no sings of problems, no stackheap corruption, etc. Also Ive run it in debug build, with the debug heap enabled which is intolerant to heap corruption.li liI assume that the function is called with valid parameters, i.e. codepszcode is a valid pointer not to confuse with codepszcode, codeszFmtcode is a valid format specifier, and all the variadic parameters are evaluated and correspond to the format string.li liCalling codefreecode with codeNULLcode pointer is ok according to the standard.li liCalling codevsnprintfcode is ok with codeNULLcode pointer and size0. It should return the resulting string length. MSversion, though not fully standardcompliant, does the same in this specific case.li licodevsnprintfcode wont exceed the specified buffer size, including the 0terminator.

Negative 23506 pWe have a Silverlight client which runs outofbrowser on a Mac. This client consumes a WCF service through a polling duplex binding.p  pIn the client I am listening to the Faulted event exposed by the InnerChannel property of the System.ServiceModel.DuplexClientBase derivative which represents the service in the client side.p  pAfter exactly one minute this Faulted event is triggered and after that the channel is not working anymore, i.e. when the server tries to send a message through the callback channel it gets a timeout exception.p  pHere is a theory I have I suspect that the underlying polling operation in the client has a timeout of 1 minute. In the server side the serverPollTimeout property of the pollingDuplexHttpBinding section is set to more than one minute. This means that the server holds a poll request for more than one minute if it has nothing to tell to the client during that time. I suspected that this revealed to the timeout in the client poll message. To test my theory, Ive reduced the serverPollTimeout setting to less than a minute and indeed  the problem is not shown.p  pIn the clientside, there is the a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibrarysystem.servicemodel.channels.pollingduplexbindingelement.clientpolltimeout28vvs.9529 relnofollowPollingDuplexBindingElement.ClientPollTimeouta property which is according to a hrefhttpblogs.msdn.combsilverlightwsarchive20100716pollingduplexmultiplemodetimeoutsdemystified.aspx relnofollowthisa blog exactly the setting which should tell the client to wait for more than a minute.

Negative 23506 pI have an application that interacts with third party COM objects. A method of the COM object that I call will sometimes stop responding. I created a Backgroundworker thread to call the function and I am trying to monitor it from my main thread to kill it if it hangs. I have additional code not supplied that tracks the processing time using system.timer from the main thread and I raise an event if it exceeds my threshold this part is fine. This is when I want to kill the thread and stop code execution. The problem is.. if I use the cancelasync method it will just pend since the code execution is stuck on the function call.p  pThe particular function call in the code snippet that hangs is objCOM.SendDataToServer. It typically takes 13 seconds to return, but if it gets no response it will just hang indefinitely and wont return at all no errors just hangs.. there is no timeout... and since I dont have access to the source function I cannot supply one.

Negative 23506 pOkay, so Im making a dynamic 2D array in Java that implements the java.util.Collection interface.  I made my array implement it because I wanted it to have the same functionality as a normal codeCollectioncode.

Negative 23506 pI have almost zero experience with random generators. I have used the standard rand functions in C and I have used perlin noise.p  pBut now, I need a cube of resolution NxNxN with N maybe 1e6 or bigger filled with white noise no perlin smoothness or whatever in which I can just pick one value and if I repick that same value, it should be the same result every time. It should be seeded, so that if I start the application again, the results need to be the same. It should not be secure or whatever, just random enough so that a human being should not be able to predict values by just thinking. If he really analyses it with a computer, its ok that its predictable.p  pIts like I would use the standard C rand function, setting the seed and doing a nested for loop for the 3 dimensions and generating a random number every time until I reach the coordinate.

Negative 23506 pI dont understand. I know it has to do with stacks not being vectors. Can someone explain this.p  pI would guess its not substitutable because stacks arent vectors. So if you have a situation that use vectors you wont be able to use a stack. The second part is a guess but since if you were to create a private class then you wouldnt know how the class is being used and might try to implement it as a vector.p

Ive reworded the title, and edited the post substantially, to make the distinction clearer.  I also explain why I the answer mentioned earlier falls short of what Im looking for.]subp  hr  pSuppose I have two codenumpycode arrays codexcode and codeycode, each consisting of emrem record aka structured arrays.  Let the shape of codexcode be emrem, emcsubxsubem and the shape of codeycode be emrem, emcsubysubem.  Lets also assume that theres no overlap between codex.dtype.namescode and codey.dtype.namescode.p  pFor example, for emrem  2, emcsubxsubem  2, and emcsubysubem  1p  precodeimport numpy as np x  np.arrayzip1, 2, 3., 4., dtype[i, i4, f, f4] y  np.arrayzipa, b, dtype[s, a10] codepre  pI would like to horizontally concatenate codexcode and codeycode to produce a emnewem array of records codezcode, having shape emrem, emcsubxsubem  emcsubysubem.  This operation should not modify codexcode or codeycode at all.p  pIn general, codez  np.hstackx, ycode wont do, because the codedtypecodes in codexcode and codeycode wont necessarily match.  E.g., continuing the example abovep  precodez  np.hstackx, y  TypeError                                 Traceback most recent call last ltipythoninput7def477e6c8bfgt in ltmodulegt gt 1 z  np.hstackx, y TypeError invalid type promotion codepre  pbrp  pNow, there is a function, codenumpy.lib.recfunctions.appendfieldscode, that emlooksem like it may do something close to what Im looking for, but I have not been able to get anything out of it  everything I have tried with it either fails with an error, or produces something other than what Im trying to get.p  pCan someone please show me emexplicitlyem the code using coden.l.r.appendfieldscode or otherwisesup1sup that would generate, from the codexcode and codeycode defined in the example above, a emnewem array of records, codezcode, equivalent to the horizontal concatenation of codexcode and codeycode, and do so without modifying either codexcode or codeycodep  pI assume that this will require only one or two lines of code.  Of course, I am looking for code that does not require building codezcode, record by record, by iterating over codexcode and codeycode.  Also, the code may assume that codexcode and codeycode have the same number of records, and that there is no overlap between codex.dtype.namescode and codey.dtype.namescode.  Other than this, the code Im looking for should know nothing about codexcode and codeycode.  Ideally, it should be agnostic also about the number of arrays to join.  IOW, leaving out error checking, the code Im looking for could be the body of a function codehstackreccode so that the new array codezcode would be the result codehstackrecx, ycode.p  hr  psup1supsub...although I have to admit that, after my sofar perfect record of failure with codenumpy.lib.recfunctions.appendfieldscode, Ive become a bit curious about how this function could be used strongemat allemstrong, irrespective of its relevance to this posts question.subp

Most likely this is because the dll was built in a separate solution and added to this solution as a resource.p  pConsequently, I can install it on my dev system, and it runs fine. I assume this is because VS already registered the dll. currently, the dll is not a part of the installer as it was causing problems, so I copied the one in the debug folder.p  pDoes anyone have any ideas what I might be doing wrongp  pAdditional Informationp  pBased on instructions from David Heffernan, I ran Dependency Walker the correct way.

Negative 23506 pGoogle Chrome is a bit weird nowadays in that v25 no longer respects a 302 redirect header and happily reposts form data on page refresh, whereas v24 and all the other browsers play nicely. Im not sure if this is just a temporary browser bug, so let me describe the mystery Im trying to solve.p  pAs far as I know you cannot open a tab using HTML or JavaScript, but a new window without explicitly set dimensions is going to open as a tab by default.p  pFirst Ive tried thisp  precodelta hrefURL onclickwindow.openthis.hrefreturn falsegt   ltimg srcNICE IMAGE altfoogt ltagt codepre  pThis was working everywhere, except in Chrome where it was shot down as an unauthorized popup window. Interestingly, sometimes when I kept clicking on it, Chrome has changed its mind and let the link open anyway as tab. This was not always the case though, sometimes the link remained dead.p  pAfter a couple of hours of experimenting and having changed from codeonclickcode to a simple codetargetblankcode I have discovered that the reason the link was killed is that the click event started from the codeltimggtcode tag within the codeltagtcode. When I replaced the codeltimggtcode with a codeltspangtcode that contained some text and clicked on the codeltspangtcode, the link could not open Chrome has identified it as an unwanted popup, but when I clicked on the codeltagtcode tag itself that had a fixed size or a padding, then it was accepted, and a new tab was born.p  pFinally I just included the images as CSS background and the codeltagtcode tags remained empty. Everything seems to be working now in every browser with this markupp  precodelta hrefURL targetblank stylebackgroundurlNICEIMAGE heightXXX widthXXX titleDescriptiongtltagt codepre  pWhat could be the reason behind the Google Chromes logic that when a link contains a tag, then it is forbidden from being opened as a new tab, but when it is empty, then it can go aheadp

Negative 23506 pIn my web application I have a custom object which Ive defined with an object function constructor and applied various shared properties through the constructors prototype.p  precodeMyObject  function Name    this.Name  Name   this.ListItem1  document.createElementli   this.ListItem1.onclick  this.SetActive   this.ListItem2  document.createElementli   this.ListItem2.onclick  this.SetActive   MyObject.prototype.SetActive  function     alertSetActive   this.Name  codepre  pNow this is a simplified example, my actual object has many more DOM elements attached to it, and each of those DOM elements have many different event listeners. My object also has many other properties and methods as well. I could also potentially have thousands of instances of this object, so code efficiency is important.p  pMy issue right now is that when a DOM event is triggered, the event handlers this property is set to the actual DOM element, not my object instance.p  pFor examplep  precodevar HelloObj  new MyObjectHello HelloObj.SetActive         This alerts SetActive Hello  HelloObj.ListItem1.click         This alerts SetActive undefined because this in SetActive     becomes ListItem1 and obviously ListItem1.Name is undefined codepre  pSo how can I set the DOM elements event handlers to a function pointer not a new function instance for each event handler which would be inefficient when theres a large number of object instances but still retain the context of the object instance itself in regards to thisp
Negative 23506 pWhen using Grab Excess Horizontal Space on multiple SWT controls within the same space, the default behavior does not divide the space between them exactly equally.  Some sort of behindthescenes calculation seems to be done to divide it sort of equally, but giving a higher ratio to larger controls.p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.come5Ctd.png altExample Imagep  pIn my example here, I have created a custom tablelike control using grid layouts in which the user can add any number of rows, as well as any number of boxes custom canvases for each row individually.  My intent is to have all boxes within a given row be of equal size  and by that virtue, all rows with an equal number of boxes will have equallysized boxes, despite being separate.  In my example, however, you can see that the one box that has label text within it grabs more space than those on the same row, due to the calculation believing that it needs more than the others.p  pWhat would be the best way to tackle this issuep
Negative 23506 pI have a webkitsharp webview which I am using to display html via the LoadString method.p  pThe webview is placed in a ScrolledWindow the ScrolledWindow is placed in a Gtk Window.p  pI want to be able to tell the webview to scroll to a specific part of the html. Normally one would do this using an anchor.p  pI have defined an anchor and some JavaScript to jump to that anchor, I call the javascript via the ExecuteScript method. This does nothing at all.p  pI have also tried adding a button to the HTML that calls the javascript, this also does nothing.p  pIs there something I can do to make this work, To make it so I can scroll to a known location in the page.p  pupdate I can make this work by saving the html to file and then loading from there using a url which tells it to scroll. However I would like to avoid doing that because of the performance hit of writing the page to disk before displaying it.p

Negative 23506 pi need to create a website. The website needs to run a Python script once the user enters the data. I have searched the net for over a week now and havent found any help.  Everybody just tells me to download DJango framework, but no body shows how to run python scripts in html web pages. I dont have any experience in web design as it is not my field. But i do know a bit of python scripting and some html. Any kind of help that puts me into right direction would be greatly appreciated.p

Negative 23506 pIm afraid that if I include my code this post will get too long and too complicated, so Ill try and explain my problem. If however youd like to see some code illustrating this problem, Ill be happy to add it afterwards.p  pI have a project, MVC4 project Website.Web that used entity framework code first. My entity classes is in a seperate project Website.Domainp  pI have a NewsPost classp  precodepublic virtual int Id  get set  public virtual string Subject  get set  public virtual string Content  get set  public virtual string ImageName  get set  public virtual DateTime CreateTime  get set  public virtual int CreatedById  get set  public virtual ICollectionltCommentgt Comments  get set  codepre  pAnd my comments class looks like thisp  precodepublic virtual int Id  get set  public virtual int CreatedById  get set  public virtual DateTime CreatedTime  get set  public virtual string Content  get set  codepre  pNow in my MVC project, I have entity framework set up with some repository classes and ninject to seperate everything from my controllers. And when I do a GetAll on my newsposts. The NewsPost.Comments will be filled with the comments thats associated with this newspost. It all works perfectly.p  pNow I got the idea that Id like to use webapi, so I set up a new MVC basic project. I removed the views folder, and removed the models folder. Then I setup all the repositories here as well along with my entity framework dbcontext class. And enabled migrations on the project to allow me to use entity framework code first in the same fasion as the Website.Web project. I also referenced the same Domain classes as the web project.p  pNow here comes the problems. I tried doing a GetAll on the newsposts, but when I inspect the list returned by GetAll, I see that though it fetches all the news in the database, the COMMENTS are null. Im pretty sure I have the Website.API set up the same way as my Website.Website.Web  So what am I missingp  pI hope I have explained well enough. Again if you need any additional code or I need to clarify some points, Ill happily do this, I just didnt wanna make the question more complicated than it already is with too much code.p

Negative 23506 pAfter a quite long struggle with the known and unfortunately one of the few help articles about controlling properties, tabbed properties etc. links below, I have decided to ask for your help.p  pWhat I need to do seems not that hard, but, well, I just couldnt bring the pieces together. So the problem isp  pI want to extend the existing properties view of Eclipse PropertySheet with some further tabs, which will be later on filled with certain information from EMF objects, which in the end implement IAdaptable. So they can be queried for PropertySources and there are already a few tabs, sections extended in the corresponding project in its manifest, which are being successfully gathered from the Selection Listener of the PropertiesView.p  pHere comes the tricky part I dont need to extend this project further, by defining further tabbed properties in its manifest. I need to implement a seperate plugin project, which does this extension job for the other main project. I dont need extra views or so. This existing project provides the property sources and like sad has its own designed tabbed property view via its extensions.p  pI have actually become quite familiar with the concept of the views and properties, I can build some Property Sources and let the Properties View gathershowmanipulate the properties. p  pBut this idea, letting an external plugin extend the Properties View with tabs of an another EMFbased plugin project, just cant get to me. I am really confused and dont know with what to begin with.p  pI would be unbelievably glad, if you could point me to the right direction.p  pThanks a lotp  pLinksp  pa hrefhttpwww.eclipse.orgarticlesArticlePropertiesViewpropertiesview.html relnofollowhttpwww.eclipse.orgarticlesArticlePropertiesViewpropertiesview.htmlap  pa hrefhttpwww.eclipse.orgarticlesArticleTabbedPropertiestabbedpropertiesview.html relnofollowhttpwww.eclipse.orgarticlesArticleTabbedPropertiestabbedpropertiesview.htmlap

Negative 23506 pI thought I should ask this before moving forward with my scripting project and later on realizing that I might be doing something wrong. Might as well save my own time in the first place by checking if what Im doing is indeed correct.p  pIm pretty new to PHP and JQuery and still getting the hang of them both. I recently came across a problem in which I wanted to run some PHP code after executing a certain function using JQuery, so after doing some reading online I got the idea to create a PHP file which does just what I want to do and POST to it from my JQuery function with the needed variables. That way I achieve my serverside and clientside goals on the same time. Howeverp  pIt doesnt look right to me. At all. I find myself having at least ten include files for one simple page. Those files get included in my HTML code when the form loads, and after refreshing a certain DIV with my JQuery function, they get reloaded. That way I can keep my script dynamic, I doubt theres something else I could do in order to keep it that way.p  pHowever I often need to update stuff after executing a certain JQuery function, hence I call a similar file to the loading one, but this time its a file which I transfer some parameters to using the POST method, through JQuery, and execute the desired action in the file itself.p  pNow, after briefly explaining my current situation and method of work, Id like to know if what Im doing is correct. In case youre still wondering what the hell I am talking about, Id like to explain in detail what I meanp  pLets say I have my index.php file which prints data from my database and some additional lines as well. Once I click one of the page buttons, I want to update my database according to the form Ive got implanted in my page as well, and then reload the DIV which contains that data ONLY. I do not want to reload the entire page.p  pNow if I wanted to do that without JQuery that would have been easy. I would POST the data to the same form and update it if the POST parameters are indeed valid. However, theres no way to refresh that DIV without JQuery, so I came up with something similar to thisp  precode.postfilesdosomething.php,  taskID    taskID , function     divtasks.fadeOut800, function         divtasks.loadfilesloaddivA.php, function             divtasks.fadeIn1500                codepre  pThats what Ive been doing in my last week of learning PHP and JQuery. Now before I proceed any further than this, Id like to know if it is indeed the right way to achieve my goal.p  pstrong EXAMPLE Bstrongp  pIve got a DIV in my HTML code which prints a table of tasks, for instance. How do I print it I include a file which echos the table at the exact point where I want the table to be displayed. Then, in each row, theres a button called delete which removes the selected row from the database. What I do is, using JQuery due to the fact I want ONLY that DIV to be refreshed, I call another external file calling remove.php and send the index of the task Id like to remove using POST. The file performs the serverside code and once its done, I load the updated table into that DIV by calling the file I used to call in the first place from my main page. This time the table will be updated due to the fact it will read the updated data from the database.p  pIs that how I get this done Is this the right way It just doesnt seem right to me. Ive never been codding that way and it seems a little bit messy.p  pThanks in advance and sorry for the long ass question.p

Negative 23506 pI am trying to insert a string into a particular place in an NSMutableArray so I have done code[myMutableArray insertObjectnewString atIndex219]code  By the way, when I do code[myMutableArray count]code it returns 273 so I know that there are enough elements.

The weird part is that when I log code[myMutableArray class]code it returns ememNSArrayM, but when the exception shows up it says that Im calling [NSCFString insertStringatIndex] and that is where the error is coming from.  I am definitely using insertObject though, and it is definitely a mutable array.

Negative 23506 pIve been working on a program which makes use of the .Net Framework. Its not based on it but it makes use of some little bits of the platform, despite of my efforts to replace most of those little bits with API calls. Well, my program is almost done and ready to publish, and now one big question remains whats the best way to publish itp  pFor a while I used the VB.Net builtin publish tool but then I realised it wasnt actually like what I expected it to be i.e. pretty much similar to any typical install program.p  pOn the other hand, if I choose any other alternative, I cant guarantee that my software is packaged with or alerts for the not presence of its dependencies, in this case the .Net references.p  pIve noticed that there is the Copy Local option for these references. Does this make my software independent, I mean if I only use emabcd.dllem and set the Copy Local to TRUE, will the program run just fine or will it still force my clients to install the .Net platform I know, is yet much likely they already have it installed nowadays, were talking about versions 2.0 to 3.5...thats actually the fact Ive been relying on.p  pThanks in advancep

Negative 23506 pI am currently working on update to an app that I didnt make myself. p  pIn it, there is a highly customized table view that is used for horizontal scrolling through images with 3 images showing at once and enabled paging. p  pThe issue is that sometimes they appear white and I think that is because they are returned by codedequeueReusableCellcode while they are still visible. So table view is reusing the cell that, because is still visible, shouldnt be reused.p  pSince there is usually not very many cells in that table, I tried with a workaround that allocs and inits a new cell every single time instead of dequeuing an old one and so far it works fine for a small table.p  pHowever, this is not a good solution and I want to do it the right way. p  pI dont know how is it decided whether cell should be put back to queue or not.p  pWhat should I do to stop cells from being queued for reusep

Negative 23506 pI have a batch of roughly 13 thousand XML files and growing by potentially hundreds per day that I need to process with LINQ filtering and transforming of the data to what I need and aggregate each of seven possible event types into a single event type file see below.  So, 13k files into 7 files.  The event types are well delineated in the XML, so the filtering amp aggregation is relatively easy.  These aggregate files will then be used to create a MySQL insert statement to our database using a script Ive already written that also works well.p  pI have functional code and its processing the files, but its been running for 23 hours thus far and looks like its probably only about half done.  I neglected to put in a file counter, so I dont really know, and Im loath to restart it again.  I can make educated guesses judging by the size of the original files 360mb or so vs. the processed file sizes 180mb or so.  I anticipate having to run this possibly about half a dozen times until we dump this method of data collection using XML files as a database and transition to using exclusively MySQL, so Im hoping I can find a more efficient method of processing the files.  I dont really want to spend potentially 2 days per execution if I dont have to.p  pIts running locally on my machine but only on 1 HD 10k RPM Barracuda I think.  Would it possibly be faster reading from one drive and writing to separate drive  Im pretty sure my bottlenecks are caused by file IO, Im opening and closing the files literally thousands of times.  Maybe I can refactor to only open once for reading and do everything in memory  I know thatd be faster, but I risk losing a whole files worth of data if something goes awry.  I still have to open each of the 13k files to read them, process them and write out to an XElement.p  pHeres the code Im running.  Im using LINQPad and running the code as C statements, but I can turn it into a real executable if necessary.  LINQPad is just so convenient for prototyping stuff like this  Please let me know if examples of the XML would make this easier to figure out, but at first blush it doesnt seem germane.

However, when I start using NGen to precompile the projects, I see a lot of bad assembly references.p  pIm using MVC 4, Visual Studio 2012, and the latest Google.Apis packages 1.5.0.1beta as of right now.p  pThe .dlls  versions I have installed in the project in question arep  precodeDotNetOpenAuth, Version 4.0.0.11165   System.Web.Mvc, Version 4.0.0.0   System.Net.Http.Primitives, Version 4.2.13.0   log4net, Version 1.2.11.0 Google.Apis, Version 1.5.0.1beta codepre  pHere are the errors I am finding in NGens outputp  pcodeFailed to load dependency System.Net.Http.Primitives of assembly Google.Apis, Version1.4.0.28227, Cultureneutral, PublicKeyTokennull because of the following error  The located assemblys manifest definition does not match the assembly reference.

Negative 23506 pI was reading the following post on another forum from a guy who seems to know a lot about C internals regarding inserting thousands of keys in to dictionariesp  blockquote   pe Map and Set lookup is done with RedBlack or Balanced Trees and   each item is allocated individually, so if youre allocating 500,000   Instruments [by symbol] with a pointer to an instrument Objectclass   associated, you have N number of bytes [plus overhead] for the   string and 4bytes [plus overhead] for the pointer. And include   oneminute, fivesecond, onesecond price timeseries on all   instruments and full tradehistory on ALL those Instruments in STD   Containers. Thats a lot of memory and a hell of a lot More Wasted due   to small object Allocation overhead p      pf Notoriously, STD Map amp Set walk thru all of the keys to FIND using LowerBound [Less    Than Compare] which is slow as hell. p      pg Some Genius may say No, they use an   Unsorted Map...well they dont, but even if they did they are STILL   doing a String Compare on a discretely allocated element.p      pWhat I do in C is the following examplep      pa Create a custom inplace String Classobject, which has two   personalities a a Byte array, and b an Integer array [of Modulus 4   and Aligned on the Native Boundary]. b Use Custom Map amp Set, which   are Hash based in 2x Dimensions with Nodes allocated in a Flat   Contiguous Memory region [which may amp can dynamically resize]. c   String [in Integer format] Hashing is done by Integer to pipeline the   CPU and Key Comparison is done similarly.p      pWith these techniques, which can only be done in C, C or ASM there   are at least 45x ORDERS OF MAGNITUDE the performance of the same   thing done in .NET, C or Java.p blockquote  pa hrefhttpwww.elitetrader.comvbshowthread.phps1eb70fb998d8a51d22050ea53d24db21ampthreadid204368ampperpage6amppagenumber3 relnofollowhttpwww.elitetrader.comvbshowthread.phps1eb70fb998d8a51d22050ea53d24db21ampthreadid204368ampperpage6amppagenumber3ap  pIf I know roughly how many keys I will be inserting, what techniques are there which I could use to design my own unorderedmap implementation which is more efficient than the standard one for my particular usage p  pany 101s about designing hash functions are most welcomep
Negative 23506 pI am trying to send text lines from a c client to a delphi server using TCP.Both are just to be run on the localhost. I want the client to send lines of text whenever it suits and the server to be able to read in and process them from the incoming stream one line at a time whenever it suits.p  pThe code below achieves this once with the delphi memo displaying some line of text 1. After that the c returns and exception saying that the connection was forcibly closed.p  pI can achieve the desired effect if I close the client connection and reestablish a new one each time a line of text is sent. But this is very slow and not feasible for my intended use.p  pI am new to TCP and have little idea what I am doing Any help in achieving the desired result would be very much appreciated.p  pDelphi Server code is....p  precodeprocedure TForm1.FormCreateSender TObject begin    Memo1.Lines.Clear    Server initialization   TcpServer1  TTcpServer.CreateSelf   TcpServer1.OnAccept  TcpServer1Accept   TcpServer1.LocalPort  IntToStrDEFAULTPORT   TcpServer1.Active  true   end TForm1.FormCreate procedure ends   procedure TForm1.TcpServer1AcceptSender TObject   ClientSocket TCustomIpClient var somestring  string begin      somestring  ClientSocket.ReceivelnDA     Memo1.Lines.Addsomestring  end TForm1.TcpServer1Accept ends codepre  pc code is.............p  precodepublic static void Main string[] args       bool connectionEstablished  false     int messageNum  1     TcpClient theclient  new TcpClient      first try establish a successful connection before proceeding     Console.WriteLineWaiting for server......     while connectionEstablished  false           connectionEstablished  true          try               Int32 port  2501             string server  127.0.0.1 the ip of localhost              theclient  new TcpClientserver, port           catch               Console.WriteLineCould not find AI server             connectionEstablished  false                   while connectionEstablished  false ends      Console.WriteLineConnected to server           while true         try                  string message  some line of text   messageNum.ToString  DA              Translate the passed message into ASCII and store it as a Byte array.

However, I cannot find exactly what structure is stored at this address. Searching through my kernals source code, I can find a couple of structs that look promising tcbheadt and a couple of others, but I know that on my system Ubuntu 2.6.3241generic the value stored at offset 0x10 of the structure is a pointer to the kernalvsyscall function, and this doesnt seem to match with the structs that Im seeing.p  pIf anyone could point out what Im missing, suggest some relevant documentation, or point me to the correct area of the source code I would be very grateful.p  pThanks,p  pRick.p

Why launching the several times pro Category worksp  pUPDATE Ive been testing and looks like the problem is with the getView function. If I check if the variable has been initialized then only the first element of the ListView changes...with all the values of the other items in the ListViewp  pSo looks like the TextView is trying to set the value is always the first one first element of the ListView.p  pAny ideap

Negative 23506 pWere using Red Hat Linux 6.4, and our application is built using Qt. The application has multiple windows and we support a layout system where our users can save the application layout and restore it later. The application is crossplatform, and on Windows, everything is fine. On Linux, were having problems restoring windows when a window spans multiple monitors. Our configuration uses a single virtual X display spanning all monitors, and the users can manually position and size windows across the monitors as desired.p  pWhat weve found is that the window manager is enforcing a policy on windows that are programmatically set and forcing them not to span across divide between two monitors. When we attempt to restore a saved layout containing a window that spanned monitors, the window manager reduces its size and repositions at as it sees fit. Basically, as long as the user makes the change by dragging and resizing the window, the window manager respects it, but an application that programmatically sets it gets overridden. Im sure someone somewhere thought this was a reasonable restriction, but our customers disagree.p  pA developer here has spent days searching and experimented trying to find a way to work around this behavior programmatically, or better yet, tell the window manager to stop doing that. Were using the GNOME desktop and Qt 4.8.x.p  pAny ideasp  pThank you, Doug McGrathp

Worst thing is that when I submit a second time the form without changing any field everything runs smooth no more validation error...p  pWhen I submit the form with an existing mail address in database everything is working fine at the first form submit.p  pId really appreciate if you guys can help to point out what is wrong in my code and why this error is raised whereas every POSTed data is correct.p  pHowever Ive a little doubt about the AJAX mixin with my CreateView since maybe it could be that when a mail address is not known, getorcreate create and returns it but  I cant imagine why  the creation of the Alert object could not yet reference the newly created Contact object.

Negative 23506 pI want to search a a file with sentences, and get the sentences with certain words out.

Negative 23506 pIm using DrawReversibleFrame to draw a rectangle with inverse colors based on mouse position over a control called SelectionTest. The basic code to use DrawReversibleFrame was taken from this a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibrarysystem.windows.forms.controlpaint.drawreversibleframe28vvs.11029.aspx relnofollowMSDN samplea.p  pIf the control is redrawn after an invalidate or refresh during the area selecting, the rectangle can disappear or have multiples copies with different sizes. You may ask me, why you are Refreshing the control Actually, Im not The control Paint event is also not raised.p  pI found out that the redraw only happens when the rectangle is drawn in between two other controls that Invalidates really fast eg on mouse move event or by a timer.p  pTo reproduce this topic isue, Ive created two sample Classesp  pstrongSelectionTeststrong, handles the DrawReversibleFrame. The checkbox This.Invalidate timer, enablesdisables a timer that calls Invalidate of the SelectionTest. If you activate it, you can easyl reproduce the unwanted DrawReversibleFrame behavior. Please notice that this Invalidade call is just a cheat to reproduce the bug. On my app Im not calling Invalidate or asking the control to be redrawn in any way. As I said, on my app the Paint event is not raised.p  pstrongForm1strong, owns the SelectionTest in between two panels. It owns two main checkboxes, that control the Invalidate on mouse move and invalidate timer. If both are selected, the unwanted behavior is more notable.p  pHere is a screenshot of the unwanted behavior.

Negative 23506 pIm implementing an application that takes a file from a developer describing a UI with data bindings using a custom language I implement. My server takes the file from a repo or directly and creates a webpage which implements the specified UI that requests a .json which specifies the data, which are served to the client. The server is responsible for, other than serving, keeping the data updated periodically from an exeternal SQL server. The application then allows the user to manipulate the data locally think spreadsheet, with initial data from that SQL server.p  pI have the node part down creation and maintenance of data structure, but Im not sure how to serve the application itself. It will possibly have many scripts which will need to be served together. Do I place them directly in a HTML or .jade file to be served Another option is to keep everything serverside and just have a UI which queries the data, but updates via said user manipulation of data are done in the server. This may make it lighter on the client, but I dont want to clog the server.p  pWould appreciate any help, let me know if anything needs clarificationp

Negative 23506 pstrongQuestionstrongp  pWhat can I do to get a locking mechanism that provides minimal and stable latency while guaranteeing that a thread cannot reacquire a resource before another thread has acquired and released itp  pThe desirability of answers to this question are ranked as followsp  ol lipSome combination of builtin C11 features that work in MinGW on Windows 7 note that the codeltthreadgtcode and codeltmutexgtcode libraries do not work on a Windows platformpli lipSome combination of Windows API featurespli lipA modification to the FairLock listed below, my own attempt at implementing such a mechanismpli lipSome features provided by a free, opensource library that does not require a .configuremakemake install process, getting that to work in MSYS is more of an adventure than I care forpli ol  pstrongBackgroundstrongp  pI am writing an application which is effectively a multistage producerconsumer.  One thread generates input consumed by another thread, which produces output consumed by yet another thread.  The application uses pairs of buffers so that, after an initial delay, all threads can work nearly simultaneously.p  pSince I am writing a Windows 7 application, I had been using CriticalSections to guard the buffers.  The problem with using CriticalSections or, so far as I can tell, any other Windows or C11builtin synchronization object is that it does not allow for any provision that a thread that just released a lock cannot reacquire it until another thread has done so first.  Because of this, many of my test drivers for the middle thread the Encoder never gave the Encoder a chance to acquire the test input buffers and completed without having tested them.  The end result was a ridiculous process of trying to determine an artificial wait time that stochastically worked for my machine.p  pSince the structure of my application requires that each stage waits for the other stage to have acquired, finished using, and released the necessary buffers for getting to use the buffer again, I need, for lack of a better term, a fair locking mechanism.  I took a crack at writing one the source code is provided below.  In testing, this FairLock allows my test driver to run my Encoder at the same speeds that I was able to achieve using the CriticalSection maybe 60 of the runs.  The other 40 of the runs take anywhere between 10 to 100 ms longer, which is not acceptable for my application.p  pstrongFairLockstrongp  precode FairLock.hpp ifndef FAIRLOCKHPP define FAIRLOCKHPP include ltatomicgt using namespace std class FairLock      private         atomicbool owned false         atomicltDWORDgt lastOwner 0     public         FairLockbool owned         bool inline hasLock const         bool tryLock         void seizeLock         void tryRelease         void waitForLock  endif   FairLock.cpp include ltwindows.hgt include FairLock.hpp define ID GetCurrentThreadId  FairLockFairLockbool owned      if owned          thisgtowned  true         thisgtlastOwner  ID      else          thisgtowned  false         thisgtlastOwner  0        bool inline FairLockhasLock const      return owned ampamp lastOwner  ID   bool FairLocktryLock      bool success  false     DWORD id  ID     if owned          success  lastOwner  id      else if          lastOwner  id ampamp         owned.compareexchangestrongsuccess, true               lastOwner  id         success  true      else          success  false          return success   void FairLockseizeLock      bool success  false     DWORD id  ID     if owned ampamp lastOwner  id          while owned.compareexchangestrongsuccess, true              success  false                  lastOwner  id        void FairLocktryRelease      if hasLock          owned  false        void FairLockwaitForLock      bool success  false     DWORD id  ID     if owned ampamp lastOwner  id          while lastOwner  id  spin         while owned.compareexchangestrongsuccess, true              success  false                  lastOwner  id       codepre  pstrongEDITstrongp  pDO NOT USE THIS codeFairLockcode CLASS IT DOES NOT GUARANTEE MUTUAL EXCLUSIONp  pI reviewed the above code to compare it against emThe C Programming Language 4th Editionem text I had not read carefully and what CouchDevelopers recommended Synchronous Queue.

Negative 23506 pIs there any documented guarantee that codeString.interncode is thread safe  The javadoc alludes to it but does not address it directlyp  blockquote   pReturns a canonical representation for the string object. A pool of   strings, initially empty, is maintained privately by the class String.p      pWhen the intern method is invoked, if the pool already contains a   string equal to this String object as determined by the equalsObject   method, then the string from the pool is returned. Otherwise, this   String object is added to the pool and a reference to this String   object is returned.p      pIt follows that for any two strings s and t, s.intern  t.intern   is true if and only if s.equalst is true.p      pAll literal strings and stringvalued constant expressions are   interned. String literals are defined in section 3.10.5 of the The   Java Language Specification.p blockquote  pNotably, the javadoc says that a String from the pool is guaranteed to be returned, but not that the pool itself is thread safe so as written it appears to leave the door open for a pool entry to be replaced in the event of competing threads, although I think this interpretation is unlikely.p  pAnd the JDK source of codeStringcode shows codeinterncode to be a native method which does not shed any light on its thread safetyp  precodepublic native String intern codepre  pMy concern is specifically related to whether the following would be fully thread safe, guaranteeing only one codeMyObjectcode is strongcreatedstrong not merely stored in the cache for each unique string value in the face of concurrent requestsp  precodepublic void myMethodString myString       Get object from cache, the cache itself is thread safe     MyObject object  myCache.getmyString     if object  null              synchronizedmyString.intern                       Retry cache to avoid race condition             object  myCache.getmyString             if object  null                              object  new MyObjectmyString                  ... do some startup  config of the object ...                 myCache.putobject                                 do something useful with the object  codepre  pI wish to avoid synchronizing on either the method or the cache itself since the creation of the object can take some time entails network access.  There are workarounds such as maintaining a local thread safe cache  pool of strings but it is not worth doing unless necessary.  The memory implications of codeString.interncode inability to remove interned strings from the cache are not relevant for this particular use case small number of strings being used.p  pI believe that codeString.interncode is thread safe and that the code above is fine, but the lack of direct confirmation from a reputable source leaves me slightly concerned.p  pThis question has been asked here multiple times before, but no concrete answer with references has been providedp  ul lia hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions14798003isstringinternthreadsafeIs String.Intern thread safeali lia hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions9294134howdointerndstringsbehavebetweendifferentthreadsandclassloardersHow do internd strings behave between different threads and classloadersali ul

Negative 23506 pIs there a way to find out in PHP the current handler set for process signals p  pe.g. I am setting codesighandlercode method as the signal handler using the following codep  precodepcntlsignalSIGINT, arraythis, sighandler codepre  pnow in the next line I am calling a framework method which internally calls thousand other methods I presume and eventually change the process signal handler to something else. This causes my codesighandlercode method not getting executed. p  pIs there a way that I could check which method is registered as the current process signal handler for a particular signal so that I could help myself debuggingp  pstrongLATEST UPDATEstrong After debugging deeper into the library code, I found out that the library function undergoes a blocking RPC call that prevented the signal to be triggered to the process.

I know there are some objects that are mutables like arrays, lists and there are others that are immutable like strings, ints, tuples etc. Basically the main diference is that the immutable cant change its value. For example if ive got an int varp  pcodex  1codep  pits value is always the same.p  pAfter that line of code if i create another var x but now  2, its another object, because they have different ids, right But now, how can i access a var by id, for example my first x varp  pHope you can help. Thanks p

Negative 23506 pIn a Rails 3.2.x app, using Retire to access an ES cluster a rake task is going through approx 1M rows to create a new index.

After the dialog is closed, the form containing the filter input is          transferred back into the popup.         .on pagebeforeshow pagehide, filtermenudialog, function e               var form   filtermenulistbox .jqmData filterform ,                 placeInDialog   e.type  pagebeforeshow ,                 destination  placeInDialog   e.target .find .uicontent    filtermenulistbox               form                 .find input                    Turn off the inset option when the filter input is inside a dialog                  and turn it back on when it is placed back inside the popup, because                  it looks better that way.                 .textinput option, inset, placeInDialog                  .end                 .prependTo destination               ltscriptgt     ltstylegt         .uiselectmenu.uipopup .uiinputsearch              marginleft .5em             marginright .5em                  .uiselectmenu.uidialog .uicontent              paddingtop 0                  .uiselectmenu.uidialog .uiselectmenulist              margintop 0                  .uiselectmenu.uipopup .uiselectmenulist li.uifirstchild .uibtn              bordertopwidth 1px             webkitborderradius 0             borderradius 0                  .uiselectmenu.uidialog .uiheader              borderbottomwidth 1px              ltstylegt  ltformgt                 ltselect idfiltermenu datanativemenufalsegt                     ltoption valueSFOgtSan Franciscoltoptiongt                     ltoption valueLAXgtLos Angelesltoptiongt                     ltoption valueYVRgtVancouverltoptiongt                     ltoption valueYYZgtTorontoltoptiongt                 ltselectgt             ltformgt codepre  pa hrefhttpjsfiddle.netlokkinasvyY1 relnofollowhttpjsfiddle.netlokkinasvyY1ap  pI actually get this to work, problem is that I have a hard time using it in my context.p  pI need a function I can call after I have populated my select, not on .mobile.document ...p  pI have made a function out of the first part .onlistviewcreate ... that I call after I have populated the select, what I believe I get stuck on is the second part .onpageshow pagehide ... p  pMy result is a popup that does everything I want, but lacks any styling and is transparent.p  pAny help would be greatly apreciatedp

Negative 23506 pI found some code from another StackOverflow answer for discovering a files MIME type based on whats read from the first few bytes of the file.

This is often an indication that other memory is corrupt. p  pThe logic works fine when used in a Windows Form or Console application, so it seems like its some security measure only applied to ASP.Net applications. Does anyone know what it would take to call this unmanaged method from ASP.Net I would also settle for a better way to derive a files MIME type that does not involve using the Windows Registry. I have run into a couple of problems with using the Registry, and I am trying to get this to work as a failover for those times when I can not rely on the Registry.p

Negative 23506 pId like to create a realtime video delay using webgl.

First I would create an array of textures. As the feed plays, I iterate through the texture array storing a frame in each texture slot and keeping track of its index. p  pI gave this a shot, but I feel like Im heading in the wrong direction here.

Negative 23506 pIm developing an Android game using Java, and I am currently on trying to figure out an efficient way of rendering the necessary textures. Suppose you have a Grid, similar to a Checkers board layout, and Tiles to fill that grid, as in each square on the board. That is the concept of what will be displayed. Currently, I am drawing each tile one by one. All of the texture loading is done upon creation and is only done once, not upon drawing. Now, for what I want to do. Ive noticed that drawing all one by one, although fast for what Im doing, it can be glitchy. In my game, the user has the ability to drag the board to view different areas. As of right now, Im only allowing the necessary tiles to be drawn depending on the location of the top left visible tile. As I said, it works quite fast, but, once the user starts interacting more or dragging faster, the rendering starts to have difficulties and isnt as fast as it should be. This causes little separation in between the tiles. Its not large, just large enough to be noticeable. What I want to do is to basically place each texture in a certain location as defined by the grid, thus creating a new texture containing the viewable area, and then render that entire area as opposed to render each tile separately. Ive done a lot of research and already looked at many questions, but I still have not found something that will help my cause. Ive read that rendering to texture using a framebuffer may help, but I havent found any easytofollow tutorials or examples, just a lot heres the code, no explanation or heres something similar to what you want, but its using different things. So, if someone could point me towards a good tutorialexample, or post a valuable answer, I would be very grateful. Im avoiding OpenGL ES 2.0 because I want my game to be compatible with many devices, and for what Im doing, 2.0 is not necessary.p  pFor a quick summary of what my code does for further explanationp  precodeforgo through visible rows    forgo through visible columns       drawTile Does the texture binding and drawing for each tile      codepre  pWhat I wantp  precodeforgo through visible rows    forgo through visible columns       loadTileTextureIntoGridTexture       I want it to combine the textures into one texture       drawGridTexture codepre  pDoing it the second way will only have one whole texture to render as opposed to visibleRowsvisibleColumns textures to render.p

This means that when its shownhidden my controls are squished and expanded again.p  pHow can I reserve space for the scroll bar Is there some kind of property or style I can set which means when its not needed its set to hidden rather than collapsed Or do my child controls need a padding or something on their right hand side to leave the space Should I put the controls in a grid and make a scroll viewer sized column for the scroll bar to be displayed in somehowp  pI would like it still to be invisible when not required I would just like the best way of making it reserve the space for when it is.p  pThanks all.p
Negative 23506 pHow do i set a text field in Eclipse to work in conjunction with an item selected in a Spinner EXAMPLE If the user selects the second item out of lets say 3 in the drop down menu i want them to be able to use the text field to the fight of the spinner to set a value to that item selected.

Negative 23506 pHello,p  pIm currently working on a Wordpress site for a client that uses the Fancy Product Designer combined with WooCommerce to sell custom engraved memory stones. The stones are black and the engravings are laser etched, which produces beautiful grayscale text and images.p  pThe client wants the images uploaded to the Designer to be grayscale so customers dont end up with an unrealistic expectation of a color print, which the client cannot provide.p  pThe Fancy Product Designer is a solution to most of our problems, but the individual elements in the designer are inaccessible to CSS, since theyre drawn on an HTML5 CANVAS element via the plugins JQuery. Our original solution was to apply a grayscale CSS overlay to the entire CANVAS element, but that obfuscated the red error messages native to the Designer.p  pI think the solution is in finding a plugin or method that automatically converts user uploads to grayscale before applying them as elements to the CANVAS.p  pPlease helpp
Negative 23506 pI have fair bit of knowledge about paging. However, I was just wondering if I can create 2 different level of paging structures from same cr3. It is stupid. But just for kicks.p  pI am planning to create 3 level paging and 4 level paging on x8664 bit machine from same cr3. Page size for 3 level paging would be 2MB and for 4 level would be 4KB. p  pPage directory would decide if it is going to point to page frame or to page table which then point to page frame. p  pI know this sounds complete crazy but I am planning to do it as a test case for a small project. Is this approach workable on x8664 hardware p  pThanksp

Negative 23506 pI wanted to use setenv.sh in RHEL7 tomcat7 standard installation. However, the file is not used. I created it in usrsharetomcatbin.  But as there are no more script files in this directory, I suppose its probably not the right place. What works is to set my values directly in usrsbintomcat file, but this file might be overwritten by a future update.p
Negative 23506 pI have a large database and I access it using Entity Framework. I get all items as a codeListltItemgtcode. When I process them in a loopp  precodeListltItemgt lstItems  UnitOfWork.Items.GetAllAsync  repository pattern and Unit Of Work patterns foreach Item item in lstItems    do something with the item  codepre  pWhat I need is if one of the items fail processing in the loop I want to be able to retry that action 3 times before ignoring it in this loop. Also I dont want the loop to brake, so no matter if an item processing is success or fail the loop should continue until the last item in the list.p  pAny idea of a pattern I can use for this purposep  pI was thinking about using try catch and if processing fails then in the catch section add it to a new codeListltItemgtcode called codeprocessAgaincode and once the main list is finished processing then handle the codeprocessAgaincode list.p

Negative 23506 pI understand when I create a view, I shouldnt be putting any code in there besides html and the data from the modelcontroller, which is what Ive done so far.p  pBut lets say there is a snipped of dynamically generated html that can be used in multiple views, Im guessing this would be a partial view that goes in the Shared folder in the project.  But since its a partial view, that has no absolute controller to handle its propagation of dynamic data from db, how would I call, and where would I code the propagation of data from the db into the view or model, if lets say the partial view was to dynamically render content for codetable.idncode, etc.p  pIm fairly to new and working off a tutorial in .net, trying to figure out how to do this. Anyone know how its done  Hope the question makes sense.p

Negative 23506 pI have a Categories controller in my CakePHP 2.5 project that queries an external, thirdparty API to get a result of category listings. Once I have this result set I then cache the object in Memcache and then use this cached object to set variables for the View to render the page.p  pThis is all well and dandy however I am forced to do a codethisgtredirectcode method once the cache has been set because otherwise my view variables are empty when the codeview.ctpcode is rendered. If a cache object already exists then I dont need to do the redirect because the variables are set immediately.p  pAs my entire app relies on this thirdparty API Im doing a lot of caching in Memcache and for the most part the app is behaving just normally with this redirect however Ive hit an issue with a redirect loop when CakePHP is unable to set the cached object in Memcache as it simply runs through the code on each redirect with the same results.p  pHere is some code so you can better understand what is happening.p  pIn my Categories controller I have the following view methodp  precodepublic function viewcid, loc, page      catCache  Cachereadsearchview.cid..loc..page     if catCache          url  Routerurl             array                 controller gt Categories,                 action gt saveCats,                 page                               thisgtrequestActionurl         thisgtredirect          thisgtsetview, catCache  codepre  pThis checks to see if a Memcache object already exists and if not I do a codethisgtrequestActioncode on the API method called codesaveCatscode that creates the cached object for me. Once this action has been performed I have to then call the redirect otherwise the codeviewcode variable data is empty. This is what that codesaveCatscode method looks likep  precodepublic function saveCatspage  null      if isnullpage page  0      cid  thisgtrequestgtdata[Cat][category]     loc  thisgtrequestgtdata[Cat][region]      address   httpapi.url.com.cid     options  array         CURLOPTPOST gt false,         CURLOPTURL gt address,         CURLOPTRETURNTRANSFER gt true,         CURLOPTSSLVERIFYPEER gt false,         CURLOPTHTTPAUTH gt CURLAUTHDIGEST,         CURLOPTUSERPWD gt usernamepassword           ch  curlinit     curlsetoptarraych, options      content  curlexecch      doc  new DOMDocument      filename  content     docgtloadXMLfilename      i  0     while isobjectview  docgtgetElementsByTagNamecategorygtitemi          foreach viewgtchildNodes as nodename              if nodenamegtnodeNamecategorytitle                  thisgtrequestgtdata[Browse][i][title]  hnodenamegtnodeValue                          if nodenamegtnodeNamecategorydescription                  thisgtrequestgtdata[Browse][i][description]  hnodenamegtnodeValue                               i           Cachewritesearchview.cid..loc..page, thisgtrequestgtdata[Browse], 2 hours     curlclosech  codepre  pFinally, just for clarity sake, here is the codeview.ctpcode file that renders the content.p  precodelttable border0 cellspacing0 cellpadding0 summarycattablegt     lttbodygt     ltphp foreach view as cat gt         lttrgt             lttdgtltphp echo hcat[title] gtlttdgt         lttrgt         lttrgt             lttdgtltphp echo hcat[description] gtlttdgt         lttrgt     ltphp endforeach gt     lttbodygt lttablegt codepre  pI essentially have two core issues here.

Now from structure Map I want to create a configuration that uses this constructor of each class and resolves the factory correctly. I do not want to define mapping for each class manually, rather create a configuration rule that will resolve each class correctly.p  pI cant figure out how this should be done Kindly give some suggestion.p

Negative 23506 pI have had exactly 10 days of iOSObjectiveC training and pretty much no other coding classes and am thus way out of my league on this, but I inherited a huge iOS app at work for which I am now responsible for upgrading from iOS6centric to iOS 7centric. Im trying to clean up all of the warnings in Xcode and simply cannot figure this one out. Ive searched for days and read every answer here on SO, but none exactly answers my question though some have helped me get closer, for which I am truly grateful.p  pI know that sizeWithFontconstrainedToSizelineBreakMode is deprecated and needs to be replaced with boundingRectWithSizeoptionsattributescontext, but for the life of me I cant figure out how to convert some existing code from the old method to the new. If I can get this one straightened out it will clear up 35 other warnings in Xcode, as that same deprecated method is used in numerous other places.p  pThe research Ive done yields a few examples of how the new method is used, but it appears it is used in different ways CGRect and CGSize and Apples documentation just sends me in one infinite loop. For my options, Apple says to use paragraph style options, yet those are completely different than what was available for the deprecated style half of those are deprecated, too. For example, they say if you dont specify a style, it will use the default paragraph style, but I dont know what attributes those are or really where to find them to verify what they are. If I DO specify a style, it has to be this one or that one, but then if I use one of those I have to also use this other one, however none of those will take effect unless my line break mode is yet another one, but the yet another one style isnt the one I need to use.p  pSo, I cant figure out how to specifically translate the attributes I have in the old code into code that will yield the exact same results in the nondeprecated method. I think Im pretty close, but cant get the correct use of NSLineBreakByClipping to translate into the new methods syntax without getting a hard error. The error is in the line widthexpectedLabelSize1.width and says No member named width in struct CGRect . If I change the CGRect so CGSize, like it was in the original code, I get a different error on that specific line about initializing an expression with an incompatible type.p  pHere is the original codep  precode        int width  0     if[surveyType isEqualToStringSite Survey]  calculate the expected width of the survey label...

How can I incorporate the NSLineBreakModeByClipping attribute I originally had if that no longer appears to be a available attribute or optionp  pTHANK YOUp  pEDIT I apologize, but I just realized that I left out some code that may help explain one of the errors I was getting. I left out the very first two lines above, where the variable width is initialized as an integer. This whole label size calculation code is part of a much larger if statement, but the only part giving me fits is the deprecated method to which this post pertains. Anyway, since width is not addressed in the CGRect, the very next line after the CGRect method widthexpectedLabelSize1.width generates the error above about width not being a member of the struct. I get that, now, but I dont know how to add the width attribute to the CGRect struct. The overall method boundingRectWithSizeoptionsattributescontext as I have it appears to be clean, in that it doesnt generate any errors on its own, but it doesnt address width or NSLineBreakModeByClipping. Thats where Im getting an error for the missing width variable and where Im getting lost on exactly how to incorporate NSLineBreakModeByClipping into the new method syntax.p

Negative 23506 pIve been testing an animation using CSS transitions and jQuery. The idea is that the user is shown a set of clickable divs to load a new page. Once a div is clicked it is expanded to fill the whole screen and load the next page.p  pBelow is a mockup of what Im trying to achievep  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comoYbMj.png altenter image description herep  pThe way I set it up was to have each of the divs positioned relatively and float left to sit next to eachother. Then once a div is clicked I faded out the divs apart the one that wasnt clicked and expand the clicked div. The problem was that when div clicked wasnt the first one i.e. blue or green it would end up snapping to the left hand side before expanding. Of course this would happen since the positioning was set to relative.p  precodeposition relative codepre  pExample of this can be seen here a hrefhttpcodepen.ioanonpeneKynL relnofollowhttpcodepen.ioanonpeneKynLap  pTo solve this issue I set up the divs with absolute positioning.

Negative 23506 pI am beginning with Asp.Net Web Api, and the Visual Studio solution Im analyzing right now is peculiar. p  pIt uses an empty asp.net web application project, with Microsoft.AspNet.WebApi.WebHost package and a manually created global.asax file to host the solution, and another project, which was spawned as an ordinary class library and then Microsoft.AspNet.WebApi.Core package was added, for the rest of WebApi related stuff for example, here are all the controllers. p  pNow, what I just cant understand is how is all of this wired together. Ive looked at global.asax and it basically just registers the routes, but I cant see what is done in the host project to specify the location of the controller classes and the rest of WebApi related stuff p  pThe reference to the other project does exist though, and Microsoft.AspNet.WebApi.WebHost package depends on Microsoft.AspNet.WebApi.Core in the other project, but as I said I dont understand how the host project manages to locate Web Api classes.p  pI am aware that you can just download Web Api package for IIS hosting, which will put everything in a single project, or go for selfhosting option. This is what I was usually seeing around, but this option with a separate almost empty project for hosting really intrigues me. Can anyone succinctly explain to me how does this work and what are the basic building blocks of a WebApi solution Ive searched around a lot, but havent managed to gain understanding of this yet.p

Negative 23506 pI have two threads  lets name them Calc thread and UI thread. Inside the Calc thread I refreshes an ObservableCollection.

For example, the following variables are in my datasetp  blockquote   pAAYANKKEquityAskbr   AAYANKKEquityBidbr   AAYANKKEquityClosebr   AAYANKKEquityDatebr   AAYANKKEquityVolumebr   AAYANREKKEquityAskbr   AAYANREKKEquityBidbr   AAYANREKKEquityClosebr   AAYANREKKEquityDate   p blockquote  pI want to extract variables that end with Ask and Bid without knowing the rest of the variables name. Is there a way to do that I want to try using a do loop but dont know how to instruct SAS to compare each variables last part of the name with Ask or Bid.p  pAfterwords. I want to create a new variable for each set that starts with full name of the variable except the last part Which is Ask or Bid. Can I do that in using an assignment statementp

So as i hope u can now see, the function in main printByCat is meant to take in a category from the user, and then serve as an argument itself for inOrderTraverseprintByCat. but Im obviously making a fundamental mistake that i dont understand. p  pAt this point any guidance would be appreciated, Im not asking anyone to do the coding for me as i know you are against that, but I really just need to understand why the function call isnt working. Im guessing the problem stems from my lack of experience with reference variables, but The error Im getting seems to suggest the function printByCat which is being taken as an argument of inOrderTraverse, does not meet the argument requirements because its not a void function, but it is a void function.... so yea Im a little lost. Anyways thanks for your time, and please let me know if i forgot anything. p

Negative 23506 pToday, out of the blue, a form that the company I work for uses, suddenly had an issue with its buttons.

When you click, they dont access the code and checking them via the shapes menu and selecting view code causes them to open the developer menu, but not the code associated with them.

Negative 23506 pIs there a way that I can do the below c, in javascriptp  precode    var proxy  new WebProxyip address, 8080     var request  WebRequest.Createhttpgoogle.com     request.Proxy  proxy     WebResponse result  request.GetResponse codepre  pSomething likep  precode    .ajax         url url,         proxy proxy         data data,         success success,         dataType dataType      codepre  pjQuerys HttpGet doesnt take a proxy so I have been unable to figure out the best approach.p  pThe justification for wanting to do this is that I have a number of web scraping scripts that are written in javascript which I would like to be able to execute from behind a proxy.p  pIf it is significantly easier to accomplish this from either Python or Node I would be open to that also.p
Negative 23506 pIn a project, I have a emUtility classem which looks like thisp  precodepublic final class Util      private Util      public static String method1InputStream in ...     public static String method2BufferedReader in ...     public static String method3File file ...  codepre  pThe class is a Utility class in the sense that it contains emonly codestaticcode methodsem. Therefore it is declared codefinalcode and its strongconstructor is codeprivatecodestrong. Creating instances or deriving subclasses would simply not make any sense.p  pI have a suite of unit tests which tests the project. I am using emIntelliJ IDEAem to run the tests, measure and visualize the code coverage. The constructor of the Utility codeclass Utilcode now brings down coverage. I would like to see a 100 on 100 logical coverage. Code like the private constructor of the Utility class brings down the coverage.p  pstrongIs there a possibility, preferably by means of an annotation, to mark a method or constructor as not relevant for code coverage in order to exclude such code from the coverage reports and thus getting a 100 coverage displayedstrongp  pI know that in general hiding code from the coverage report is lying to your own disadvantage. I wouldnt mind if the report would have a list of ignored items  actually, that would be good, to check if someone is ignoring stuff which shouldnt be ignored. The point is really about code for which coverage makes no sense, like the private constructor of a Utility class.p  pIve tried to find if codeannotations.jarcode contains a candidate. The only annotation which looked even remotely as if it could do it was codeTestOnlycode, but it does not fulfill this purpose. I also peeked around in codepluginscoveragelib.jarcode and couldnt find a candidate, but maybe I just missed itp

Negative 23506 pI am trying to have a script which I trigger via cron to turn a pin low and high based on a temperature, however.. I have having a couple of problems.p  p1  When the script starts and it setsup the GPIO pin, it will either pull the pin high or low depending on paramater  there doesnt appear to be a way to tell it not to change the current state of the pin.p  pThis is a problem because if the relay is high and the default state is low then the relay will be set low and then could change to high again very quickly after  doing this every minute is pretty hard on what the pin is controlling same applies if the default state is high.p  p2  When the script exits it cleans up the GPIO pins and changes the state of my pin. Ideally if the script turns the pin high then when it exits I want the pin to remain high. If I remove the cleanup function then the next time the script runs it says that the pin was already in use problem.p  pSo the script which runs every minute looks like this.p  precodeusrbinpython import RPi.GPIO as GPIO import time import random from temp import Temp  custom object to handle the temp sensor.  def main     random.seed     GPIO.setmodeGPIO.BCM      PUMPONTEMP  38     PUMPOFFTEMP  30     GPIOPIN  18      try         t  Temp2800000168c492         GPIO.setupGPIOPIN, GPIO.OUT          currenttemp  t.getTemp         print currenttemp          if currenttemp gt PUMPONTEMP             GPIO.outputGPIOPIN,  1             print Turning the pump on s  currenttemp          if currenttemp lt PUMPOFFTEMP                 GPIO.outputGPIOPIN,  0                 print Turning the pump off s  currenttemp      except KeyboardInterrupt         pass     finally         GPIO.cleanup  if name  main     main codepre  pThis run every minute via cron.

You must restart the NameNode daemon to apply the changes to the cluster B. You must restart all six DataNode daemons to apply the changes to the cluster. C.

You must modify the configuration files on only one of the DataNode machine F. You must modify the configuration files on the NameNode only. DataNodes read their configuration from the master nodesp  pLot of places shows answers A amp F but I want to know example of such parameter change.

Negative 23506 pMy question is whether monads in haskell actually maintain hakells purity, and if so how. Frequently I have read about how side effects are impure but that side effects are needed for useful programs e.g. io. In the next sentence it is stated that haskells solution to this is monads. Then monads are explained to some degree or another, but not really how they solve the sideeffect problem.p  pI have seen a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions4063778inwhatsenseistheiomonadpurethisa and a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions3117583ishaskelltrulypureisanylanguagethatdealswithinputandoutputoutsidethisa, and my interpretation of the answers is actually one that came to me in my own readings  the actions of the IO monad are not the io themselves but objects that, when executed, perform io. But it occurs to me that one could make the same argument for any code or perhaps any compiled executable. Couldnt you say that a C program only produces side effects when the compiled code is executed That all of C is inside the IO monad and so C is pure I doubt this is true, but I honestly dont know in what way it is not. In fact, didnt Moggi sp initially use monads to model the denotational semantics of imperative programsp  pSome background I am a fan of haskell and functional programming and I hope to learn more about both as my studies continue. I understand the benefits of referential transparency, for example. The motivation for this question is that I am a grad student and I will be giving 2 1hour presentations to a programming languages class, one covering haskell in particular and the other covering functional programming in general. I suspect that the majority of the class is not familiar with functional programming, maybe having seen a bit of scheme. I hope to be able to reasonably clearly explain how monads solve the purity problem without going into category theory and the theoretical underpinnings of monads, which I wouldnt have time to cover and anyway I dont fully understand myself  certainly not well enough to present.p  pI wonder if purity in this context is not really welldefined p

Negative 23506 pI have an old application written in php that provides access to large datasets that are organized into 37 different databases, with each database containing a number of tables. Each table represents data from a different piece of equipment, and each database represents the data from a single time period, so the structure is as followsp  precodeDatabaseTimePeriodone     table machine 1  table machine 2  table machine 3  and so on...  DatabaseTimePeriodtwo  table machine 1  table machine 2  table machine 3  table machine 4  and so on... codepre  pThe tables vary in length but typically contain between 500,000 and 1,000,000 rows of data.p  pThe application needs to be extended and needs a new front end, and am looking at reworking it using Django, but I am having a conceptual problem which I am hoping someone can help with.  The php code is very simple  the user selects the time period and table of interest in the front end, and this is used to build a MySQL SELECT query that retrieves the relevant data which is then stored in an array object.  The query is constructed in a single line of code that essentially uses a variable taken from the front end to identify the database, and another for the table.  The naming of the databases and tables follows a pattern that includes a sequential numeric component and this simplifies the construction of the query. p  pAs I understand things from my initial forays into Django, a django model represents a single table from a single database, and so to be able to access all of my tables across the different databases, I would need to create a model for each table.  This would mean having around 200 models.  Also, I would need some way to tell django which database and which table in that database the model should be linked to. Finally, I would have to be able to select in code which model to use for any given query.  I have looked into this and it seems that it would be possible to do this, but it would mean creating a large number of routers, and a lot of code compared to the relatively simple php code.p  pIs it possible to have simple code that would essentially tell django Go to database x, look at table y, and select the following columns even if this mean circumventing the use of a model and just reading the data into an array  p  pI have searched online for a solution to this, but cant find an example that appears to address this situation, and while the django documentation does explain the use of multiple databases, it does not seem to provide a simple way to access the databases that I have without creating what looks like a very large and cumbersome body of code, and the explanation of using raw queries still seems to rely on the one model per table paradigm.  I am sure that my difficulty is due to my limited experience with Django and that there is a way to do what I want, but I at the moment I am stuck. p  pIt would be very helpful is someone with considerably more django experience than I have could point me in the right direction, or tell me if this looks like a situation that django is just not suited to.p

Negative 23506 pI am running several different docker containers that contain PHP, Nginx and a few other tools. I would like to use the new Elixer feature of Laravel 5 but I know nothing about node.js or how to connect to a Node.js container. p  pAll of the tutorials I have read use the installation of Node.js on the same machine, not in separate docker containers or servers that must talk to each other remotely. p  pI was hoping someone could point me into the right direction because I have no idea even where to start. I know that you can run node as a server and set variables like host and port etc, but Im not sure if thats what is needed here. p  pIt seems like it since PHP, Nginx, etc will need to speak to node remotely while in their separate containers, but as I said the examples on The Laravel site and other tutorials I have found only show how to run commands etc with node on the same machine. I am lost..p

Negative 23506 pI was looking for a good solution to scroll a codedivcode that is scrollable of course to its top, with a single click, and in an animated way. I came across a hrefhttpstackoverflow.coma245596133606363thisa the 2 solution, which seemed pretty good, but it scrolls the whole window instead of a specific codedivcode.p  pI slightly modified this function so that it can scroll a container instead of the whole window. Heres my versionp  precodefunction scrollContainerToTopscrollDuration, containerid      const container  document.getElementByIdcontainerid,     scrollHeight  container.scrollTop,     scrollStep  Math.PI  scrollDuration  15,     cosParameter  scrollHeight  2     var scrollCount  0,         scrollMargin,         scrollInterval  setIntervalfunction               if container.scrollTop  0                  scrollCount  scrollCount  1                 scrollMargin  cosParameter  cosParameter  Math.cosscrollCount  scrollStep                 container.scrollTop  scrollHeight  scrollMargin              else clearIntervalscrollInterval         , 15  codepre  pAnd a hrefhttpsjsfiddle.netxqhcgfnt3 relnofollowherea is a functional example, which you can try out scroll the section with all the Hellos to the bottom, then click the button to scroll it up with javascript.p  pSo my problem is that instead of just scrolling up, it scrolls up and down rapidly two or three times before settling on the top. However, if you call the scroller function with a bigger delay say 300ms, then everything is fine. I tried it with Safari, Chrome, and an older version of Firefox as well, and every one of them produces the same glitchy result.p  pSo why is this function glitchy if I supply it faster scroll timesp

Negative 23506 pI am just getting started in a Rails project after a long time in the PHP world. p  pThis project is in a very early stage, meaning that is a good time to do major changes, and currently comprises two different rails modules, one for administrators and one for users, both in separate rails instances. What I would like to do is to merge both projects into a single rails instance, which I believe it will improve the manageability of the application in the long run. p  pBoth instances share the same database and each of them has a devise model for authentication. I have been documenting myself about ways of merging both projects and I came up with two alternatives the first would be to create two namespaces, one for users and another one for admins, and share the model and framework logic. the second one would be to create engines for admins and users, which seems to be cleaner but much more complex. p  pI have read a lot documentation and I am experimenting with rails, but at this point I am in need of a more experienced opinion. p  pThank you in advance, and I appreciate your thoughts on this. p

Negative 23506 pSo I have a webRTC app that uses socket.io It works perfectly if I just host it locally on my computer using node server.js. p  pAnd then I deployed it with the free server on openshift..... p  pAnd now, it all pretty much works EXCEPT for two things p  ol lipWhenever two people are connected via webRTC, and one person just closes the window, it DOES NOT REGISTER WITH THE OTHER PERSON. It works perfectly fine if I do this locally, but when I do this on openshift, it does not register at all. The first person just thinks they are still connected. WHY IN THE WORLD IS THIS Because on socket.disconnect in the server I have it emitting a function to the other client... and it works perfectly when I run it locally. So why in the world doesnt the openshift server emit that message on socket.disconnect pli lipI have a usercount. All users get updated about the user count every time another user opens up a window with that page. Now again, locally this works perfectly. It updates everyone in a second. Now, on openshift, it doesnt update until like, what, a minute later or something So its very, very, very off. pli ol  pIs it just a weak server I mean, they give me 512MB ram on the free server. How in the world is this not enough to just be quick about this p  pMy computer has 24GB of ram, just for reference, although Im pretty sure its not using all that memory when running my server locally. p  pSo is this a problem with the server If so, what server do you recommend that runs perfectly just like my local machine, for a low price It needs to run node.js, socket.io and support webrtc. p

Negative 23506 pThis is a problem I am working on img srchttpi.stack.imgur.comdanHg.png altenter image description herep  pI implemented a brute force solution and a divide and conquerrecursive solution. They both work with this inputfrom post 1 to 4p  pFor the brute force solution, what I did was generate all subsets of 1,2,3,4, iterate through all the subsets and check only the ones that contained 1 and 4. I know that my brute force solution would run in  emO2supnsupem time because there are mathematically em2supnsupem subsets and I have to iterate over all of them.p  pFor my recursive solution. what I did was break this problem down so that the only solutions that are generatedwill be checked will be ones that contain 1 and 4. For example, from 1 you can go to 2,3,4 and if you go to 2, you can go to 3,4, and so on... till 4 is reached.p  pAfter analyzing both algorithms, I realized the only difference is that the divide and conquer wouldnt even check the subsets that didnt have 1 and 4 but the brute force would, say 2,3. How would this difference affect the time complexity of the recursive algorithm. Would the recursive algorithm also run in emO2supnsupem or something less because it checks less subsetsp

Everything seems to work properly on DEV and yet PUBLISH does not copy certain components to the target location. While unit testing on PROD, I get this errorp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comLv79g.png altUnit testing problem in PRODUCTION machinep  pWhen I compare the contents of the MDSbin directory DEV vs. PROD machines, I notice that certain DLLs on my DEV machine are strongemmissingemstrong p  ul liCrystal.Decisions.CrystalReports.Engine.dllli liCrystalDecisions.ReportSource.dllli liCrystalDecisions.Shared.dllli liAppLicenses.dllli liand there are othersli ul  pOf course, these stem from References in my project in Visual Studio. When I expand the bin folder in Solution Explorer, I note in the context menu for these items that strongInclude in Projectstrong is checkable. I go ahead and mark them as INCLUDE in PROJECT and the icon changes. I then PUBLISH the selected files. I verify they are in fact existing now in the target location on PROD. p  pWhen I try again on PROD, the error has gone away and I get the proper output. p  pAm I expecting too much from Publish On the DEV machine, the mere presence of the various DLLs in the bin directory was enough that runtime testing worked fine. Shouldnt PUBLISH deploy the whole site p  pIn short, it seems like discovery of missing dependencies should not be so difficult after PUBLISH at the root level of the project.p  pp.s. this is a hybrid site mostly classic ASP with some ASP.NET 2.0 code that uses these component DLLs listed above. I have not had these deployment issues with ASP.NET 4.0 sites travelling from the same DEV to the same PROD machines with PUBLISH.p

Negative 23506 pIm developing a chess game on android. The chess board layout is like thisp  precodeLinearLeyout LinearLayout here goes points TableLayout  the chess board  TableRow   RelativeLayout    ImageView    pawn image   RelativeLayout    Imageview    pawn image codepre  pecc..p  pNow i use drag listener to move pawns, but i like use also a transition animation. So I use clipChildfalse in the xml to allow imageview to draw out of its bounds. This clip instruction is on every RelativeLayout, TableRow and so on TableLayout. This doesnt work as expected. I can produce the animation from more recent views to the older, but not the other. For example, if the animation goes from box 2E to 4E it works, but not from 4E to 2Ein this case image go under other views. I think because 4E is declared before in xml. So I try to set clipChildren to false programmatically in onCreate and onWindowFocusChanged but result is the same. Maybe isnt that the problem. Suggestions   p

Negative 23506 pI want to redirect nonwww URLs of our site site A to their www counterparts but I cant seem to do this.

Negative 23506 pIm new to NoSQL and Cassandra and would like some input on my decision in choosing the schema design for my database for handling hydrological data. As a side note Im developing the application in Python and have been toying around with the Datastax Python Driver.p  pIn short, the incoming raw data is stored as commaseparated values in different files depending on the measuring intervaltype of reading, basically depending on the variable I call sensorid. For instance, the hourly data looks like thisp  precodesensorid int, year int, julianday int, hourminute int , data1 float, data2 float, data3 float.. codepre  p..so a sample reading would look something likep  precode715, 2015, 15, 2230, 3.65, 6.12, 95.2 ,... 715, 2015, 15, 2330, 4.12, 5.12, 87.2 ,... codepre  pwhere 715 would indicate that its an hourly reading, so a daily reading would use another sensorid. Lets call it 716 and a sample reading would look something along these linesp  precode716, 2015, 15, 3.52, 5.23, 84.5,.. codepre  pFor the daily reading were obviously skipping the time details since the reading is only gathered once per julian day. You probably get the point. p  pSo each location has its own reading intervals where the number of data columns, i.e. parameters of interest is depending on the intervaltype of reading. For instance, the daily data consist of 20 columns and the hourly 15.p  pstrongQueries of intereststrongp  pI want to be able to run a simple quality control on emsomeem of the data parameters, probably mainly air temperature, water temperature, wind speed and water level, and maybe a few others as well. To begin with, this will probably be to check whether the parameter value exceeds of falls below a given maxmin threshold. I also want to be able to plot the raw data, the quality controlled data, and the values that didnt pass the QC test. p  ul liIs a particular value within a given threshold lt,li liGet all parameters at a given interval sensorid and time mainly used for plottingli ul  pMy initial thoughts was too just convert the datetime parameters to timestamp and just insert each rowreading into a table with the same structure as the raw file. For instance, the locationhourly would look using the values abovep  precode  sensorid       timestamp       data1  data2  data3  data n          715  20150101 223000  3.65   6.12   95.2                  715  20150101 233000  4.12   5.12   87.2                codepre  pand set the primary key sensorid, timestamp in which the sensorid would become the partition key and the timestamp the clustering key. This would obviously work in the cases we want to fetch all values taken at a particular time, but not for the range queries were interested in when performing the QC.p  pThis is where Im at, and Id love to hear your views on this.p

Negative 23506 pOk, so I know what the issue here is. Im using a watch, and because of the value Im setting by calling a function in my service, a new array is created every time, and the watch constantly finds a new value. My question though, is how to fix this. My current set up is like this only including relevant portions of codep  h2clientCtrl.jsh2  precode.controllerClientCtrl, functionscope, ionicModal, ionicPopup, stateParams, clientService, opportunityService    scope.id  stateParams.clientId   scope.clients  clientService.getClients   scope.opportunities  opportunityService.getOpportunitiesscope.id    scope.watch     function return opportunityService.opportunities ,      functionnewVal        scope.opportunities  newVal         codepre  h2opportunityService.jsh2  precode.serviceopportunityService, functionhttp      this.getOpportunities  functionid          this.results  []         if  typeof id  undefined              this.results  this.opportunities                  else              for var a0 altthis.opportunities.length a                  if this.opportunities[a].clientId  id                      this.results.pushthis.opportunities[a]                                                return this.results      codepre  hr  pInefficient code aside, basically whats being done here is that the service gets a JSON object not shown which is stored in this.opportunities. The getOpportunities function allows me to return that to the controller. On my view, I have a list of the opportunities where I can add, edit, and delete. When I add a new opportunity via a popup modal it doesnt show up in the view until I navigate to a different page in my app and then return. p  pEssentially, adding an item works, but I would like it to show up without having to navigate away. I attempted to solve this by adding the watch, and while it was an effective solution, I received the digest iteration errors. Id prefer to get rid of them now so that they dont cause any future issues.p  pIs there a better way to get my view to update when I add an item without having to navigate away, keeping in mind that the JSON object storing the items is in the service, and relies on the passing of an ID parameterp
Negative 23506 pSo I am using ngCordova for most of my apps and I have recently had to chose between having admob or google analytics included because of a conflict in the plugin. a hrefhttpngcordova.comdocspluginsgoogleAnalytics relnofollowGoogle analyticsa on its own works and a hrefhttpngcordova.comdocspluginsadMob relnofollowAdmoba works on its own.

Below is a sample snippet from my plugin.p  precode             id mkCit,             labelMake Your Own Citation,             elements [                                      id mkCitType,                     type select,                     label Type,                     items [                         [ Book ],                         [ Journal ]                     ],                     default  Journal,                     onChange  function                         ifthis.getValue  Book                             .bookField.show                             .journalField.hide                         else ifthis.getValue  Journal                             .bookField.hide                             .journalField.show                                                               ,                                      type hbox,                     widths [ 10, 84],                     align  center,                     id  bookAuthInfo,                     onShow  function                         var dialog  CKEDITOR.dialog.getCurrent                         ifdialog ampamp dialog.getName  simplebox                             dialog.getContentElementmkCit, bookAuthInfo.getElement..closesttr.attr                             class  bookField                                                                       ,                     children [                                                      type  select,                             id  authorType,                             label  Author Type,                             items  [[Author],[Editor],[Compiler],[Translator]],                             default  Author,                             commit  function widget                                 widget.setDataauthorType,this.getValue                                                      ,                                                      type text,                             id authName,                             label Author Name,                             setup function widget                                   this.setValue widget.data.authName                              ,                             commit function widget                                   widget.setData authName, this.getValue                                                                            ]                 ,                                      type  text,                     id  bookTitle,                     width 50,                     label  Title,                     onShow  function                         var dialog  CKEDITOR.dialog.getCurrent                         ifdialog ampamp dialog.getName  simplebox                             dialog.getContentElementmkCit, bookTitle.getElement..closesttr.attr                             class  bookField                                                                       ,                     setup function widget                           this.setValue widget.data.title                      ,                     commit function widget                           widget.setData title, this.getValue                                       ,                                      type  text,                     id  articleTitle,                     width 50,                     label  Article Title,                     onShow  function                         var dialog  CKEDITOR.dialog.getCurrent                         dialog.getContentElementmkCit, articleTitle.getElement..closesttr.attr                             class  journalField                                                               ,                                      type hbox,                     widths [ 10, 84 ],                     align  center,                     id  journalAuthorInfo,                     children [                                                      type  select,                             id  journalAuthorType,                             label  Author Type,                             items  [[Author],[Editor],[Compiler],[Translator]],                             default  Author                         ,                                                      type text,                             id journalAuthName,                             label Author Name                         ,                     ]                     onShow  function                         var dialog  CKEDITOR.dialog.getCurrent                         dialog.getContentElementmkCit, journalAuthorInfo.getElement..closesttr.attr                             class  journalField                                                                              codepre

Negative 23506 pIm still learning python and a lot of basics are still complicated to me. I just started out using codewars.com, and it seems like an awesome tool to learn any of the languages they have set up so far. The only downside is their python is only 2.7, so some of the code has to be modified from 3.0 to work properly. Im working on one problem now that wants me to convert I think translate is what Im looking for numbers from the keyboard layout to the phone layout. So Im trying to translate 7894561230 to 1234567890. Maybe this is entirely the wrong way to go about doing it, but as I said, Im still learning. Here is the code I have, but its not working.

Negative 23506 pI have an existing Windows Service application, based on .NET Framework 4.5 and want to add an user interface for configuration and diagnostics.p  pIn Windows Forms or WPF the service would send its data via TCP connection .NET Remoting or WCF to the client, but that would require additional configuration, either on client or on server side and also requires service and client to be on the same compatibility level, which in worst case means multiple clients for multiple services.p  pI have an idea of melting service and user interface together in one application using new ASP.NET5 Web Application.  When the Windows service starts, first I would like to start the web server and then start the rest of the service. So it would be possible for the user to interact with the service without installing any additional software. The Web Application and Windows Service should run in the same AppDomain, so that I can change an object in user interface and the service can use it immediately.p  pSo far, I have played a bit with new Console Application dnx451 and hosting via WebHostBuilder and got a working page, but I dont think that thats the solution Im looking for. I get the project output and a cmdfile to start the server.p  pSo my first question is Is there an equivalent implementation of WebHostBuilder for .NET 4.5, to run a web site in tradional Visual Studio projectsp  pMy second thought would be to completely run the service inside IIS, so Id have a WebPage hosting the existing service functionality. But Im not aware of any differences between applications in IIS and as Windows service. And whats about ASP.NET 4.6 in this case Because I think I will have to convert my existing libraries into new ASP.NET5 class library Packages.p  pThe last possibility I could think of would be to publish web application to IIS and service as Windows service and communicate via WCF NamedPipes, like I would do with WPF or Windows Forms application.p  pTo sum up, Is there anything planned to support my first idea or do I have to choose one of the others And which option would probably be the bestp

Negative 23506 pIve been doing some digging through old SO questions about the inherent evilness of mutable structs, but as a C noob I cant tell whether this is an intended use of structs in c.p  pSo basically Im learning c by making a simple textbased dungeon game. I have codeEnemycode, codePlayercode, and codeAttackcode classes and an codeEffectcode Struct. Every codeAttackcode can have an codeEffectcode, and when the codePlayercode object attacks an codeEnemycode object, it uses its own codeAttackcode object to calculate damage, and then passes the codeAttackcodes codeEffectcode struct to the codeEnemycode where it is added to a list of Effects.p  pEffect has a duration field, which is decreased every turn until it reaches 0 via this method p  precodepublic void tick          duration  codepre  pEvery turn, the codeEnemycode iterates through the list of codeEffectscode, calling codetickcode and checking whether codedurationcode has reached 0. If it has, it removes the struct from the list.p  pNow is this bad, or is it one of the intended uses of structs Coming from a java background, Im used to doing this by codenewcodeing objects. Is that the way its supposed to be done in cp

Negative 23506 pWe have this problem where our application has stopped working on Android 5.0 devices since the Google released the latest version of Android System WebView 45.0.2454.95.  If we disable this version of the WebView by going to the device settings, apps, Android System WebView and clicking Disable the application works again.  However this is not satisfactory for some of our customers and we really need to find a fix where it works with the latest version of Android System WebView.p  pOur application makes heavy use of jQuery and jQuery Mobile.  We currently use jQuery 1.7.1 and jQuery Mobile 1.1.0.  We cant easily upgrade to a newer version.p  pWhen a page loads up in the application any method called inside a jQuery selector doesnt run, e.g.p  pcodefunction      Your code here codep  pThis code successfully executes when the old version of the WebView is used but not when the latest version is used.  Attempting to call the code outside the selector has resulted in other problems.p  pDuring my investigations so far, I have discovered the problem seems to come from something in jQuery Mobile as when I remove the reference to jquery.mobile.js, the code then executes again.  However as you might expect the problems then occur due to jQuery Mobile being an integral part of our application.p  pDoes anyone know of any issues with jQuery Mobile on the latest version of Android System WebView that could be causing thisp

Negative 23506 pI am attempting to access a web application I have developed inside my Parallels VM.  I think I have followed most things correctly however missing that last step I think.  I am running IIS7 and from OS X get the default blue IIS page when I hit a hrefhttp10.211.55.3 relnofollowhttp10.211.55.3a and also a hrefhttp10.211.55.380 relnofollowhttp10.211.55.380a.    I get the same message when I hit a hrefhttplocalhost80 relnofollowhttplocalhost80a from within the VM. p  pWhen hitting those in Postman running on mac I get the message 405  HTTP verb used to access this page is not allowed. but at least I get that blue page from IIS visible in the host so I figure that is something i.e. the network type setting as shared in the Configuration is correct.  p  pAlso, Anonymous Authentication is Enabled in IIS for the site, and the firewall on the VM is off.p  pSo I assume port 80 is getting through, however when I test another urlport no luck i.e. when I a hrefhttplocalhost81apimenuitem relnofollowhttplocalhost81apimenuitema from within the VM, this time I get a 200 JSON response from my app as expected.  However when I hit the equivalent URL on the OS X host a hrefhttp10.211.55.381apimenuitem relnofollowhttp10.211.55.381apimenuitema I get Safari cant open the page because safari cant connect to the server 10.211.55.3.p  pI have also gone into Parallels Desktop PreferencesAdvancedChangeSettings... and tried adding a Port Forwarding Rule for the IP address setting both source amp destination ports to 81 but get the same result.  p  pSo I think it is my VM setup or IIS. IS there a good resource for setting up IIS on a VM for external access in a development environment such as this maybep  pEDIT With a little trial and error I now find I get the same No response result when hitting a hrefhttp10.211.55.381apimenuitem relnofollowhttp10.211.55.381apimenuitema from within the VM, however the localhost equivalent a hrefhttplocalhost81apimenuitem relnofollowhttplocalhost81apimenuitema works fine.  So the question comes down to how to setup IIS so the IP address works the same as localhost within the same development machine.p  pkind regards, Paul.p

Negative 23506 pI have been trying to figure this one out for a bit, not coming up with the right approach.  I read through a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions28243315attachjavafileassourceforjarinintellijthis questiona, which Id already tried, but its not working quite right.. using IntelliJ EAP 142.4675.3p  pWhat I am trying to do, is to debug a junit test using a jar extending the Provider class file Ive placed into JAVAHOMEjrelibext. I want that jar to be debuggable as well.p  pThe problem is, if I attach my source directory as the source for a jar, then, in a stack trace, when I click the named file containing a method I wish to view, IntelliJ asks me to choose between two of the same file, presumably because it knows about the source its in a module in my project and its also been told about the source via the jar source path I added.p  pI tried adding the provider.jar to the project module dependencies tab, which caused intellij no end of grief.  Reverted back to having it in jrelibext, and, in the Platform SettingsSDKs1.8Sourcepath tab, I added the module sourcepath.  This lets intellij step into the .java file for the jar, vs the .class file, but, when it does so, I now get a banner at the top of my code windows which says Alternative source available for the class xxx and theres a combobox at the RHS with the module name listed twice in the latest EAP, it actually lists the module and the jar [same name as module, with .jar].  And, as mentioned earlier, the IDE asks which which of the very same file I wish to edit when I click a file in the stack trace.p  pClearly, there is something not quite right.. what am I missing  I find it odd that the ide will not open the source code when stepping into the jar until I attach the code as above, but, when I do, it sees it twice.p
