Positive 96 pstrongBackgroundstrongp  pIm working with an API and am trying to port some code in an ASP.NET MVC project which they provided into a Dotnetnuke environment.  Each of my controllers inherits a base controller which in turn inherits Controller. As far as I can tell the purpose of  this base class is to cache a class WebApiHelper containing all API calls in a session variable meaning its created once and  pulled from memory on subsequent requests.  p  pHere is the code for the base controllerp  precodepublic class ServiceController  DnnApiController     private WebApiHelper application     protected WebApiHelper Application          get  return application          protected override void InitializeRequestContext requestContext           Response.Cache.SetNoServerCaching       Response.Cache.SetNoStore        ifSystem.Web.HttpContext.Current.Items.ContainsApplication                 application  WebApiHelperSystem.Web.HttpContext.Current.Items[Application]               else                application  new WebApiHelper         System.Web.HttpContext.Current.Items.AddApplication, application             codepre  pI know this works as I have tested it in an Asp.net MVC application. p  pstrongThe Problemstrongp  pAs dotnetnuke is built in Asp.net webforms ive had to change my approach. Ive had to setup a dotnetnuke web service to pull data from this WebApiHelper file  so passwords, keys etc are obscured from the public in the javascript however the file structure is much the same. Each dotnetnuke web service controller inherits a base controller ServiceController. This ServiceController is  where ive tried to replicate the code from above however I was unable to override an initializer with a RequestContext parameter so I resorted to using a simple constructor. p  precodepublic class ServiceController  DnnApiController     public WebApiHelper application     public WebApiHelper Application           get  return application          public ServiceController           if HttpContext.Current.Session[application]  null                application  new WebApiHelper         HttpContext.Current.Session[application]  application               else                application  WebApiHelperHttpContext.Current.Session[application]         application.Balls  new instantiation             codepre  pHowever this gives me the following error.p  pa hrefhttpi.stack.imgur.comwdgdD.png relnofollowimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comwdgdD.png altenter image description hereap  pAfter debugging the code Ive found that this error is generated where im trying to access the session. Is there any reason why the session wont work. Perhap because im not overriding as in the  the first code snippet.p  pAm I going to all this trouble for no reason. Would it be best to just create a new instance of WebApiHelper on each web requestp
Positive 96 pI am using ASP.NET boilerplate for the first time. I have been able to apply the strongApplicationName.Corestrong, strongApplicationName.Applicationstrong and strongApplicationName.ORMstrong NHibernate libraries with success.p  pHowever, I need to make my application services available as a web service. My understanding is that once I deploy the library named strongApplicationName.WebApistrong as a web application to IIS, I automatically have a web service which exposes my application services through apiservices.p  pWhen I did this, I kept getting error 404.0 as shown below when I try to make requests to the API over my browserp  pa hrefhttpi.stack.imgur.comGykJD.png relnofollowimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comGykJD.png altError 404.0 for WebApia p  pI need some advice on where exactly I am getting things wrong.

Positive 96 pIm new to Azure App Services and Im not getting the point about Azure API Apps access control. As I understood, the API Apps services has built in features to enable authentication on the API using Azure ActiveDirectory or thirdparty services.p  pIn my case, Im studying to use this with ASP.NET 5 REStful services capabilities. In that way, Ill usually need to authorize or not the access to some endpoint based on the claims a user might have, because in order to authorize or not something is a matter of business rules instead of a simple allowdeny based on login.p  pAs I understood, Azure will just take care of authentication, it will redirect the client to the identity provider, will get the token and generate another token which will allow access to the API. But, how this connects with my app Is it possible, working that way, to deal with claims for users If so, how is this donep  pIm a little in doubt, because Im failing to see how this really connects with my app, in the sense of allowing me to do what Im already used to do.p

Positive 96 pMy data is in a SQL database and models are scaffolded, all works well on my machine. I deploy the web application to another machine, on that machine I also instantiate my SQL database. The web application launches fine until I try to login. On my local machine in my Web.config I see that the DefaultConnection is local and I believe this is where user identities, authentication etc. takes place. My DB entities are correctly accessed with another connection string. Ideally Id like to move the ASP.NET user database to be alongside my model tables. I create the deployment as a file deployment as the target machine has no internet access.p

Negative 96 pSay I want to design a database for a community site with blogs, photos, forums etc., one way to do this is to single out the concept of a post, as a blog entry, a blog comment, a photo, a photo comment, a forum post all can be thought as a post.  So, I could potentially have one table named Post [PostID, PostType, Title, Body .... ], the PostType will tell what type of post it is.p  pOr I could design this whole thing with more tables, BlogPost, PhotoPost, ForumPost, and Ill leave Comment just its own table with a CommentType column.p  pOr have a Post table for all types of post, but have a separate Comment table.p  pTo be complete Im using ADO.NET Entity Framework to implement my DAL.  p  pNow the question what are some of the implications if I go with any route described above that will influence on my DB performance and manageability, middle tier design and code cleaness, EF performance etc.p  pThank you very muchp  pRay.p

Negative 96 pIm trying to convert one range of numbers to another, maintaining ratio. Maths is not my strong point.p  pI have an image file where point values may range from 16000.00 to 16000.00 though the typical range may be much less. What I want to do is compress these values into the integer range 0100, where 0 is the value of the smallest point, and 100 is the value of the largest. All points in between should keep a relative ratio even though some precision is being lost Id like to do this in python but even a general algorithm should suffice. Id prefer an algorithm where the minmax or either range can be adjusted ie, the second range could be 50 to 800 instead of 0 to 100.p

A number of designs for exceptions have been proposed but each adds significant complexity to the language and runtime. By their very nature, exceptions span functions and perhaps even goroutines they have wideranging implications. There is also concern about the effect they would have on the libraries. They are, by definition, exceptional yet experience with other languages that support them show they have profound effect on library and interface specification. It would be nice to find a design that allows them to be truly exceptional without encouraging common errors to turn into special control flow that requires every programmer to compensate.p      pLike generics, exceptions remain an open issue. p blockquote  pstronga hrefhttpgooglestyleguide.googlecode.comsvntrunkcppguide.xmlshowoneExceptionsExceptionsGoogle C Style Guide Exceptionsastrongp  blockquote   pDecisionp      pOn their face, the benefits of using   exceptions outweigh the costs,   especially in new projects. However,   for existing code, the introduction of   exceptions has implications on all   dependent code. If exceptions can be   propagated beyond a new project, it   also becomes problematic to integrate   the new project into existing   exceptionfree code. Because most   existing C code at Google is not   prepared to deal with exceptions, it   is comparatively difficult to adopt   new code that generates exceptions.p      pGiven that Googles existing code is   not exceptiontolerant, the costs of   using exceptions are somewhat greater   than the costs in in a new project.   The conversion process would be slow   and errorprone. We dont believe that   the strongavailable alternatives to   exceptions, such as error codes and   assertions,strong introduce a significant   burden.p      pOur advice against using exceptions is   not predicated on philosophical or   moral grounds, but practical ones.   Because wed like to use our   opensource projects at Google and   its difficult to do so if those   projects use exceptions, we need to   advise against exceptions in Google   opensource projects as well. Things   would probably be different if we had   to do it all over again from scratch.p blockquote  pstronga hrefhttpblog.golang.org201008deferpanicandrecover.htmlGO Defer, Panic and Recoverastrongp  blockquote   pDefer statements allow us to think about closing each file right after opening it, guaranteeing that, regardless of the number of return statements in the function, the files will be closed.p      pThe behavior of defer statements is straightforward and predictable. There are three simple rulesp      pstrong1. A deferred functions arguments are evaluated when the defer statement is evaluated.strongp      pIn this example, the expression i is evaluated when the Println call is deferred. The deferred call will print 0 after the function returns.p  precode    func a           i  0          defer fmt.Printlni          i          return          codepre      pstrong2. Deferred function calls are executed in Last In First Out order after the surrounding function returns.strong This function prints 3210p  precode     func b          for i  0 i lt 4 i              defer fmt.Printi                   codepre      pstrong3. Deferred functions may read and assign to the returning functions named return values.strong p      pIn this example, a deferred function increments the return value i after the surrounding function returns. Thus, this function returns 2  p  precode    func c i int          defer func  i          return 1       codepre      pThis is convenient for modifying the error return value of a function we will see an example of this shortly.p      pstrongPanic is a builtin function that stops the ordinary flow of control and begins panicking.strong When the function F calls panic, execution of F stops, any deferred functions in F are executed normally, and then F returns to its caller. To the caller, F then behaves like a call to panic. The process continues up the stack until all functions in the current goroutine have returned, at which point the program crashes. Panics can be initiated by invoking panic directly. They can also be caused by runtime errors, such as outofbounds array accesses.p      pstrongRecover is a builtin function that regains control of a panicking goroutine.strong Recover is only useful inside deferred functions. During normal execution, a call to recover will return nil and have no other effect. If the current goroutine is panicking, a call to strongrecover will capture the value given to panic and resume normal executionstrong.p      pHeres an example program that demonstrates the mechanics of panic and defer p  precodeltsnipgt codepre      pFor a realworld example of panic and recover, see the json package from the Go standard library. It decodes JSONencoded data with a set of recursive functions. When malformed JSON is encountered, the parser calls panic is to unwind the stack to the toplevel function call, which recovers from the panic and returns an appropriate error value see the error and unmarshal functions in decode.go. There is a similar example of this technique in the Compile routine of the regexp package. The convention in the Go libraries is that even when a package uses panic internally, its external API still presents explicit error return values.p      pOther uses of defer beyond the file.Close example given earlier include releasing a mutexp  precodemu.Lock   defer mu.Unlock codepre blockquote

Negative 96 pI want the people who uses my software not to be able to send copies of the app to other people. What Im thinking I could to is use privatepublic key encryption this way send the user an activation code that I would keep in a database in a web server. Then, the first time the user runs the app it would send to the server the code  some info about his hardware. Then I would take that information as it would be an encrypted string and decrypt it with a private key in the server, and send the decrypted string back to the user. The app would store this string and encrypt it with a public key every time the app runs and the app would check that it matches the hardware info  his code. But Im guessing there is a simpler way to do this. I really dont need that much security. Any suggestionp  pstrongEditstrong Actually my publicprivate keys trick is not going to work at all.

Negative 96 pTogether with Ben BuildStarted, weve been building the a hrefhttprazorengine.codeplex.com relnofollowRazorEngine projecta, which is designed to allow you compile and parse arbitrary templates outside of ASP.NET MVC.  The project has had a couple of releases for a while now, and the feedback has been great thanks to all. strongButstrong, we have encountered an issue Medium trust. p  pBecause we are using the CSharpCodeProvider to compile the Razorgenerated classes to load into the current AppDomain for execution, we encounter a codeSecurityExceptioncode when trying to invoke it, due to the LinkDemand enforced on it.  When a normal ASP.NET page is compiled regardless of trust level, it does so through a codeBuildProvidercode which is normally GACd, and thus is implicity granted the appropriate permissions to compile.  Hence ASP.NET WebForms works as standard in Medium trust.p  pOur code does not, and we need to target scenarios where our built library wont be deployed to the GAC and is running in Medium trust. So we considered building a codeBuildProvidercode specifically for it and defer compilation to the ASP.NET build system, but this seems overly complex and disjointed, and the provider itself requires both a mapping through a file extension, and a virtual path which may or may not resolve to a physical file  think codeVirtualPathProvidercode.  It all seems overkill, just to get the project working in Medium trust not just that, but purely for ASP.NET projects as our engine also works outside of ASP.NETp  pSo my question is this, does anyone know of any techniques or technologies for compiling C code in a Medium trust environmentp  pThanks in advance.p

The new way of doing this in XCode 4 seems to be adding the frameworks to Link Binary with Libraries under Build Phases in the projecttarget settings.p  pWhat about header search paths  Ive just tried adding several Qt frameworks to my project in XCode 4, and the headers are not found until I manually add the correct paths to header search paths.  The project in question was started as a unix executable.. is this the reason  In another iOS project I havent had to specify the search paths, only the frameworks.  Some difference in the project typep  pOr maybe Im doing things correctly and theres some problem with the Qt frameworksp  pTylerp

Negative 96 pI have some candidate aspects  p  ol liThe hash function is important, the hashcode should be unique as far as possible.  li liThe backend data structure is important, the search, insert and delete operations should all have time complexity O1.  li liThe memory management is important, the memory overhead of every hashtable entry should be as least as possible. When the hashtable is expanding, the memory should increase efficiently, and when the hashtable is shrinking, the memory should do garbage collection efficiently. And with these memory operations, the aspect 2 should also be full filled.  li liIf the hashtable will be used in multithreads, it should be thread safe and also be  efficient.  li ol  pMy questions are  p  ol liAre there any more aspects worth attention  li liHow to design the hashtable to full fill these aspects  li liAre there any resources I can refer to  li ol  pMany thanks  p  pbrbr bAfter reading some material, update my questions. b hr In a book explaining the source code of SGI STL, I found some useful informationsp  ol liThe backend data structure is a bbucketb of blinked listb. When search, insert or delete an belementb in the hashtable   ol   liUse a bhash functionb to calculate the corresponding bpositionb in the bbucketb, and the belementsb are stored in the blinked listb after this bpositionb.   liWhen the size of belementsb is larger than the size of bbucketsb, the bbucketsb need bresizeb expand the size to be 2 times larger than the old size. The size of buckets should be bprimeb. Then bcopyb the old buckets and elements to the new one.   liI didnt find the logic of bgarbage collectionb when the number of belementsb is much smaller than the number of bbucketsb. But I think this logic should be considerated when many binsertsb at first then many bdeletesb later.   ol liOther data structures such as arrays with blinear detectionb or bsquare detectionb is not as good as blinked listb. liA good bhash functionb can avoid bclustersb, and bdouble hashb can help to resolve bclustersb. ol  p The question about bmultithreadsb is still open.

Negative 96 pBackground I have a class modeling a chip with registers, the chip has a bunch of registers, one of them is a high temperature limit for the builtin temperature sensor.p  pI have the followingp  precodeclass foo   def initself      does not set self.hiTemp     ...   def setHiTempself, t     self.hiTemp  t   def getHiTempself     return self.hiTemp   def checkHiTempself     return self.temp gt self.hiTemp codepre  pThe reason that I dont declare codeself.hiTempcode in the codeinitcode is because the user may not care about the tempsensing capabilities of the chip. The user can be using the chip in different ways, and there is no meaning in giving this variable a meaningless value. However, if the user tries to use codeself.hiTempcode without first setting it, the error of using undeclared variables is much easier to debugbacktrace than some obscure error like comparing numbers and None or in some case even no errors at all. p  pThis is all going fine until I start pylint, and of course I get W0201 Attribute defined outside stronginitstrong just about everywhere. Im just wondering if this style of coding is frowned upon, and if so, what the Pythonic way is.p  pThanksp

Negative 96 pI can stream video RTMP just fine in JW Player by LongTail Media. The Pause seems to work, however using Windows 7s Resource Monitor I can see that the player continues to download data when the video is paused, it downloads for about 60 seconds and does not seem to be longer for longer videos. I have found the same using the examples on longtailmedias website, so I know it is not something I have done.p  pI want a way to pause the video and have it stop downloading, this will save us lots of bandwidth. But also have it continue where it left off if play is pressed again.p  pI checked the logs on our wowza media server, which indicates that the player actually waits 60s before it sends the pause command to the server.p  pLongTails support say that the pause functionality uses the built in NetStream class and its behaviour is out of their control.p  pI have tested flowplayer online examples, and a couple of Adobe  OSMF examples and they all continue to download for 60 seconds after the video is paused.p  pA way to get this working in JW player would be best, but Are there emanyem flash players that will stop downloading while paused p  pIf this is not possible with RTMP are there any technologies that will do this with a flash playerp  pthanks p

Negative 96 pI have been trying to use AJAX calls to php to do various tasks, and reading the material on it at w3schools.com, where it mentions that if you are using more than one function with an XMLHttpRequest object, that you should create a single function which creates the Object, and pass it parameters including the onreadystatechange function.

Negative 96 pI am a bit confusedp  pWe have a chat application that has a requirement to NOT scroll chat, if the user is scrolled up and we have a scrollInfo class that provides us with the ability to check if the scroll bar thumb is at the bottom of the scrollbar, so that we can identify if we should scroll or not.p  pUnfortunately, there are many different ways to scroll chat.  One could use the scrollbars updown boxes, or the scrollbar thumb, or just scroll using the mouse wheel.p  pHowever, if the updown arrows are used, we have no issue.p  pAnd, if the scrollbar thumb is used, the VScroll event does fire, but we have no way of identifying which DIRECTION the thumb is moved, or how to check if its being held down, without using a timer to constantly query the left mouse button status.p  pAnd, lastly, if mousewheel is scrolled, while we can tell which direction its going by looking at the codeDeltacode property, the codeVScrollcode event still fires after the Mouse Wheel event is handled.  So, we essentially have a duplicate scroll happen.p  pI need some help with this.

Negative 96 pI want to write an application that reads as many sensor vaulues per time as possible from different sensors GPS, Acc, Gyro, Compass.

Can someone confirm thisp  pb Does polling instead of using EventListener increase the rate Whats the best way to read sensor values fastp  pc Has the use of NDK any influence on the power consumption of the application I didnt find anything about this.p  pd Im new to Android.

Negative 96 pI have survivorship data binomial for individuals across a morphological space fish skull shapes. Id like to design a test to see if local areas of death in this space are larger than expected by chance. The probability of a single group of observed deaths could be simply computed from the binomial distribution onetailed. However, I am interesting in comparing against holes of similar magnitude anywhere within the space, not just in the observed position manytailed test. What is the best way to code this in Rp  pSo, for example given 100 survivors out of 1000 individuals, each with a unique position in a twodimensional space, I can draw 1000 random samples and randomize which individuals survive in each, holding constant the total number of survivors and their position in twodimensional space in each sample. p  pIn each of these samples 100 random survivors within a fixed space of 1000 individuals, I would then like to find the largest spatial region which contains no survivors. In the simplest case, this region could be constrained to be an ellipse. At this point, Im not sure how to best code this test statistic p  pThe significance of the size of observed holes could then be compared to the number of random samples containing holes of equal or larger size.p  pThanks for your helpp
Negative 96 pi am making a small project which will be incorporated into larger project. basically what it does is keeps track of threads that are created by way of adding them to a main struct which keeps track of what the thread does its main function and its pthreadt id. the other struct keeps track of the data to be passed to the function and the element number of where the pthreadt id is stored inside threads[]. its a bit micky mouse and it jumps around a bit but it all works besides when it is time to kill the thread. i get no segfaults and no errors and the program finishes fine, but the thread does not get killed when pthreadkill is called the function returns 0 meaning no error and it worked although the thread continues to run until the main application returns.p

Negative 96 pI am writing a little test app which connects to a SQL Server database which has 2 tables in it. Table 1 is a list of data with a non unique key which points to multiple rows in table 2. At the moment what I do is traverse each record in Table 1 and then get the relevant records from Table 2 with a separate query. Table 2 has over 26 million records in it and this process takes a very long time. The data in Table 1 could have just a few hundred records in it or anything up to about 1 million.p  pIs there a way of speeding up this data access Perhaps using a table join to get all the data in one query Or anything elsep  pSorry I cannot post the database tables or current code as I am under NDA as it is very sensitive data.

Negative 96 pUPDATE Formal List of questionsp  ol libWhat do the float values both input parameters, and the output of a 2D noise implementation representb  Partially answered, the inputs are the coordinates. How about the ouput Also, can I use my integer as a float for the coords 1.0, 122.0, etc.li libWhats a good way to implement a seed in a 2D noise generatorb Should I just make it a 3D noise generator using the 3rd param as a seed Would that imply each seed can generate unique 2D noiseli liGoing along with the 2d map, generating bitmaps seems to be along the same lines. bHow could I generate a bitmap from the outputb Presumably floats.li ol  pMy questions are what do the float values both input parameters, and output of a cut and paste perlin noise 2D implementation represent How could I generate a bitmap from them If I can get a 2d array of some data type, Im sure I could figure out how to use it to simulate my terrain.p  pAnd, I would use a cut and paste implementation, if I could ensure that I could seed the values for them. Thats the other part of the question, it is an unanswered one I found a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions7213469bestwaytoaddseedtoperlinnoiseherea.  whats a good way to implement a seed in a noise generatorp  pOk, I understand that this question has been asked many many times, so let me explain what I have researched and found.p  pFirst, I found a hrefhttpfreespace.virgin.nethugo.eliasmodelsmperlin.htm relnofollowthisa site here, which seemed to be a winner for explaining it to me. However, I then came up with another question which I found asked but not really answered completely a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions7213469bestwaytoaddseedtoperlinnoiseherea.p  pI then tried to get my hands dirty and code some in Java, which is my language of choice. I found a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions7746743parametricrandomfunctionfor2dnoisegenerationthisa, which had me trying out the hash function given as an answer as my noise function, because I could use a seed there. Then I ran into a problem of it not returning a float to follow the rest of the processes in the tutorial. Back to the drawing board. Along the way, I found many many more sites with questions about perlin noise.p  pI found an unanswered question here that I hadnt even thought of yet because I havent gotten my implementation to work. I cant find the link anymore but it said something along the lines of, even if you had a copy and pasted implementation what are the float inputs you put into the function I was told I needed to pass INTEGERS that are my x and y on the map. I get float outputs from the cut and paste implementations as well. What do THOSE mean How are those 2D If I could keep things as integers it would make sense in my brain but in a way, I see that keeping them as integers would not be plausible for interpolating and smoothing the values for a continuous curve.p

Negative 96 pI am trying to develop a date picker. I am preparing an entire calendar in a JavaScript string and appending it to a codedivcode element.  The problem is that the jQuery click event behaves differently. If I write the entire code in a .js file on codedocument.readycode event and add that script file at top of the HTML file, the click events are not working properly Meaning, if Im in the month of March, if I click next, the calendar is navigating to the next month April, but then afterward, whenever I click it, Im always getting the old month.p  pIf I write the entire script at the bottom of the html file after the body tag, it works fine.p  pWhen I put that code in jsFiddle. It works there too. I think they append script code at bottom of the page.p  pWhat could be wrong if the code is in a codedocument.readycode event handler  Here is a hrefhttpjsfiddle.netramstheroyalhvbEs2 relnofollowthe jsFiddle linka.p

Negative 96 pI have some content I want to show in iframe with fancybox. When I use it, it pops up with horizontal and vertical scroll bars even though all the content is inside of it. Inspecting it in Firefox shows that when I click on codehtmlcode everything is inside but there is a little left over that is outside of the highlighted box. The next level up is codeiframe.fancyboxiframecode which includes the scroll bars. I looked at the css and that has padding and margins set to zero so I dont know why the scroll bars are there. Right now as far as options I just have codeautoSizefalsecode. All I have inside the body of the page I want to show is a form.p

Negative 96 pI use a closed source application that can be configured to use a LDAP directory for getting group memberships of a user. The LDAP query can be configured at will.

Perhaps it is a viable solution to build something based on OpenDSOpenDJ or ApacheDS but I have no idea they were designed with this in mind. On the other side an elegant solution might be persisting the API results in the LDAP but I dont know if this data must be retrieved using JPA again or if its valid to retrieve it using a LDAP query. I read something about the uboundid LDAP server SDK, perhaps this is another option.p  pAll of this are just ideas, I have no experience in this area. Ideas are very appreciated.p  hr  pThanks a lot for this information. I took a look at unboundid sdk and the example that starts up a ldap server and imports a ldif. But your remarks about productive use make me think I perhaps consider a different solution although I definitely will come back to unboundid when I need to write jndi or ldap unit tests.p  pIm now able to describe my needs better, perhaps this can be achieved by unboundid or you know another solution that makes me achieve this. I will need to intercept queries, then invoke the API see example above in order to retrieve the data and then feed it to the underlying ldap directory. Perhaps unboundid offers an interface to this. Do you know something about this  Or more about the design of ApacheDS  The reason for this interception is that the applications I can query contain some 100000 entries and I only want to copy those to the ldap who are needed.p  pWriting about this I see another option perhaps it is possible to do some aop in order to intercept the call.

Negative 96 pOne functionality of python that I found very handy when working with databases or files are the codeentercode and codeexitcode functions you can give to a class. Now by using the codewithcode statement you can make sure that in this block codeentercode is first called and you can open the database or file and after its done codeexitcode is called and you can close a database or file.p  pI want to open and close a sqlite transaction every time a function from my Database class is called. I can do it at the start and end of every function, but since it has to be done for every function is that class, I was wondering, are there methods that get called before and after each function call Like SetUp and TearDown in unittesting. p

The browser just jumps up and adds a hash character to the url. Firebug is not showing any errors on bindings either. p  pThe reason the div container has a withsearchViewModel is because there is a master viewmodel for the whole page.

Negative 96 pI am experimenting with a small Scalatra web application, which I have imported as a project into Eclipse.  p  pI have used Eclipse to manage a few Lift applications before.  With a Lift project, SBT copies all the dependency JARs to a codelibmanagedcode directory.  I can therefore add those JARs to Eclipses build path, and it coexists with SBT just fine without complaining about missing classes.p  pWith Scalatra, however, the dependency JARs dont seem to get copied anywhere helpful during the development cycle.  If you build a WAR file, then the dependencies get bundled up into that... but there doesnt seem to be anything like Lifts codelibmanagedcode directory.p  pAssuming that anyone else uses Eclipse in developing Scalatra projects, how might I easily set up Eclipses build path  I suppose that I could manually create entries that point my local Ivy repository onebyone, although that seems a bit ugly.  Perhaps theres an easy way through SBT to setup something similar to Lifts codelibmanagedcode subdirectory inside the project directory.p

Negative 96 pIn my android application I need to capture the users speech from the microphone and then pass it to the server. Currently, I use the codeMediaRecordercode class. However, it doesnt satisfy my needs, because I want to make glowing effect, based on the current volume of input sound, so I need an AudioStream, or something like that, I guess.  Currently, I use the followingp  precode    this.recorder  new MediaRecorder     this.recorder.setAudioSourceMediaRecorder.AudioSource.MIC     this.recorder.setOutputFormatMediaRecorder.OutputFormat.MPEG4     this.recorder.setAudioEncoderMediaRecorder.AudioEncoder.AMRNB     this.recorder.setOutputFileFILENAME codepre  pI am writing using API level 7, so I dont see any other AudioEncoders, but AMR Narrow Band. Maybe thats the reason of awful noise which I hear in my recordings.  p  pThe second problem I am facing is poor sound quality, noise, so I want to reduct cancel, suppress it, because it is really awful, especially on my noname chinese tablet. This should be serverside, because, as far as I know, requiers a lot of resources, and not all of the modern gadgets especially noname chinese tablets can do that as fast as possible. I am free to choose, which platform to use on the server, so it can be ASP.NET, PHP, JSP, or whatever helps me to make the sound better. Speaking about ASP.NET, I have come across a library, called NAudio, may be it can help me in some way. I know, that there is no any noise reduction solution built in the library, but I have found some examples on FFT and autocorellation using it, so it may help.br  To be honest, I have never worked with sound this close before and I have no idea where to start. I have googled a lot about noise reduction techniques, code examples and found nothing. You guys are my last hope.br Thanks in advance.p

Negative 96 pI was brushing up on my CSS skills earlier and I came across a tutorial that has me going bald. Heres the link a hrefhttpcss.maxdesign.com.aufloatutorialtutorial0304.htm relnofollowhttpcss.maxdesign.com.aufloatutorialtutorial0304.htma I have spent hours researching for an answer to this but havent came across anything that helped me.p  pThe author of the tutorial does not give any good details to what is going on with elements. I understand that floating lifts an element off the page and floats it in the given direction left  right. Clearing resets the floated element and places it back into the flow of the page.p  pHow are those elements still floated to the right if the right side has been cleared I dont understand the logic behind this. Any clarification on this would be deeply appreciated emand maybe I can keep some of my hairem.p  pstrongEditstrong Here is CSS code and a screenshot from the tutorial linked above...p  precode.floatright      float right     margin 0 0 10px 10px     clear right   p  margintop 0  codepre  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comw1reu.png altenter image description herep

Negative 96 pits hard too find exactly the answer to my question, thats why I want to ask it here, even it is poorly explained somewhere else. I try to add the solution in code so that everyone can get back to my results. But first it has to be solved.p  pIts about triangulation with OpenCV codecvtriangulatePointscode. I know its poor documented but it can be found at willowgarage now search for the documentation 2.4.9 p  ol liI use for a chessboard calibration 22 stereo images two cams of different angles ect. for a stable intrinsic parameters.  li ligot the chessboard corners with codecvfindChessboardCornerscode li lioptional  codecvcornerSubPixcodeli licreate objectPoints codecvPoint3f kmsquareSize, jmsquareSize,0.0fcode over all chessboardpoints k  chessboard width, j chessboard height or vice versa, with squareSize  realworld size li lido 2.4. for every imageli liput everything in here codecvcalibrateCameraobjectpoints1, imagepoints1, image.size, intrinsic1, distCoeffs1, rvecs1, tvecs1code this function works perfect like i wanted, i am doing it with the second camera images too. After long research I found thisli licodecvMat R12  R2R1.t cvMat T12   T2RT1code This is for the relationship RT between cam1 amp cam2. This works pretty well, Ive tested it with the results of codecvstereoCalibratecode. li liAt this step I wanted to use my tvecs and rvecs for a reprojection 2D too 3D and 3D too 2D. Last I got done with codecvprojectPointsobjectpoints1[i],rvecs1[i],tvecs1[i],intrinsic1, distCoeffs1, imagePoints1code  works fine  I got with 48222 points a maximum from 2Pixel difference at only one single point. But know i cant go further with the triangulation from 2d too 3D. I have too use codecvtriangulatePointscode. How do i get this workli ol  pWhat I have done so far trying without an good result You first need the projectionmatrices P1 and P2. p  precodecvMatx34d P1  cvMatx34d   R1.atltdoublegt0,0, R1.atltdoublegt0,1, R1.atltdoublegt0,2, tvecs1[0].atltdoublegt0,                                 R1.atltdoublegt1,0, R1.atltdoublegt1,1, R1.atltdoublegt1,2, tvecs1[0].atltdoublegt1,                                 R1.atltdoublegt2,0, R1.atltdoublegt2,1, R1.atltdoublegt2,2, tvecs1[0].atltdoublegt2 codepre  psorry this looks heavy but its only the rotationmatrix rodriguesrvecs1,R1 and the translationvector tvecs1. Is this wrong do i have to inverse the rotationmatrix R1 p  pNext step you need the imagePointsCorners in left and right image. These imagePoints are the undistorted corners which I got from findChessboardCorners. p  pAfter using codecvtriangulatePointsP1, P2, cvMatundisPtset1.reshape1,2, cvMatundisPtset2.reshape1,2, point3dcodepoint3d is a 4D point where the fourth parameter has too be eliminated by codeconvertPointsHomogeneouspoint3d.reshape4, 1, point3dCam1codep  pThis is what I have done so far  but its not working.  Does somebody know what I am doing wrong Any wrong thoughts at the last steps Ive tryied the math but I am not sure about the projectionMatrix P1 and P2. I know its built like [Rt], but is it my tvecs and tvecs is it transposed or inverse Any help would be great, but pls help me out with some code or clear steps  not with more links where I should read and think, I realy did a research, I have the learning OpenCV book, OpenCV2 cookbook, and Hartley and Zisserman here in front of me. But I cant get to it.p

as I can, in order to make it easier for you to see the whole bundle. As mentioned earlier, you can see the website and test out the popup issues. I use Google Chrome for testing it out, and if all works well there, I check out the site in other browsers to make it compatible. p  pAlso, I think the jumping popup issue is solvable. I saw other tutorials for making modal popups and those work just fine in my mobile browsers, but I cant afford having to recode all those popups. Unless I can edit the existing code and shorten it, while remaining the functionality and without having to edit anything in index.php. Anyway... Please just take a look at it. It might be easier to just meddle with it inbrowser, inspecting the elements and such... Its quite a lot of code.p  pAny help is GREATLY appreciatedp

However, since the database stores private information from the user, it should be private. p  pThe purpose of the app is to utilize the users profile information in conjunction with information of a geographic area terrain, climate, flora, fauna in the United States from an online database in order to calculate how well they will be able to survive for a given amount of time. p  pI am planning on using the Android development tools plugin with the Eclipse IDE. p  pSo I wanted to ask a couple of major questionsp  ol lipWhat will I use from the Java development tools to add users and enter in their profile information to the database In other words, what will I use in order to communicate with the databasepli lipSince the application will be pulling information from an online database, it will need some way of transferring and using that information.

Negative 96 pIm using Knockout for a View bound to a ViewModel with some depthcomplexity to it.  p  pTo validate my ViewModel i need to compute across the entire VM tree walking amp comparing descendants.  I was hoping to leverage the knockoutvalidation plugin  a hrefhttpsgithub.comericmbarnardKnockoutValidation relnofollowhttpsgithub.comericmbarnardKnockoutValidationa to create some arbitrary custom validation rule and report any errors.p  pI set up one possible approach using a KO computed observable  a hrefhttpjsfiddle.netdrdamourZrVZ7 relnofollowhttpjsfiddle.netdrdamourZrVZ7a .  The validation rule is to make sure no 2 SubCollections have the same value.  This is working, but its not using KnockoutValidation and my rule is now implemented in my computed observable which seems wrong.p  pMy question is very similar to a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions13364788knockoutvalidationvalidatedobservablegrouperrorKnockout Validation validatedObservable group errora but i find the discovered solution hosted at a hrefhttpjsfiddle.netCGuW26 relnofollowhttpjsfiddle.netCGuW26a to be less than idealp  precodevar viewModel       num1 ko.observable50.extend number true, min 0, max 100 ,     num2 ko.observable50.extend number true, min 0, max 100    viewModel.isValidSum  ko.validatedObservable                             num1 viewModel.num1,                             num2 viewModel.num2                         .extend mustEqual 100   ko.applyBindingsviewModel codepre  pas its duplicating the ViewModel by adding its validated self as a property to itself isValidSum.  I tried to eliminate this redundancy  a hrefhttpjsfiddle.netdrdamour5B8s4 relnofollowhttpjsfiddle.netdrdamour5B8s4a but the view fails to bind to the validatedObservablep  precodevar viewModel       num1 ko.observable50.extend number true, min 0, max 100 ,     num2 ko.observable50.extend number true, min 0, max 100    var vm  ko.validatedObservableviewModel.extend mustEqual 101   ko.applyBindingsvm codepre  pThis may be a bug with KO or KOValidation, or i may just be doing it totally wrong.p  pSo the question is whats the best way in knockout to determine if a VM is valid against a condition that evaluates across multiple properties amp layers of the VMp

Negative 96 pIm experiencing a memory leak when using javascript to automatically refresh the page every X seconds.  I have verified that this leak is not happening in Firefox or in Chrome, and its also not happening in IE 7810  only IE 9 im on Win7.  p  pWhats crazy to me is that when Im looking at this in IE9 and watching the memory usage creep up, I can open the developer tools in IE, change the browser mode to IE8, and the memory stops creeping up as the page continues to reload.  Change it back to IE9 mode and it starts rising again.p  pThe sample page below is a mockup showing the leak, but the page Im experiencing it on is a monitoring page which I leave open most of the day.  If I leave this page open for several hours in IE9, it eventually uses up all of the memory that the 32bit application can access 1.5Gb, and then IE becomes unresponsive.p  pI have looked at this sample page with a hrefhttpwww.outofhanwell.comieleakindex.phptitleMainPage relnofollowdrip0.5a and a hrefhttpblogs.msdn.comgpdepagesjavascriptmemoryleakdetectorv2.aspx relnofollowIEJSLeaksDetectora  but both of those leak finders are based on IE7 rendering engine where this is not a problem.  And both of those tools show no problems.p  pWhat can I do to mitigate this other than just using a different browser, or is there anything I can dop  pSample .aspx file is below.  p  pre classlanghtml prettyprintoverridecodelthtmlgt ltheadgt     lttitlegtlttitlegt ltscript typetextjavascriptgt     var sec  15     function pageLoad          setIntervalupdReload, 1000          function updReload          if sec  0              window.location.reload          else              document.getElementByIdspnReload.innerHTML  sec               ltscriptgt ltheadgt ltbodygt     ltform idForm1 runatservergt         ltaspScriptManager IDScriptManager1 runatserver gt         lth1gtCurrent Time is ltNow.ToShortTimeString gtlth1gt         Reload in ltspan idspnReloadgtltspangt     ltformgt ltbodygt lthtmlgt codepre  pbr strongUpdatestrong Heres a new wrinkle I just discovered  IE9 Quirks mode does not seem to have the leak  only IE9 Standards mode.

So then I started thinking that it may be related to .NETs own javascript functions..

Negative 96 pMany websites Ive created have user data stored in sessions for quick access.

Negative 96 pIm following the ZF2 convention of storing tests in the modules and everything is working fine when tests are run from within each module. What I would like to do is have a root level phpunit.xml that calls the individual module tests and consolidates them to produce code coverage data and other metrics.p  pThe problem is that each individual test suite is bootstrapped within the modular phpunit.xml files. The only way Im aware of doing things is to configure the bootstrap in each phpunit.xml file which obviously doesnt get picked up when running tests from root as individual xml files are ignored.p  pSo my question is is there a way for a rootlevel phpunit.xml file to read individual phpunit.xml and bootstrap files from modules, a kind of phpunit config inheritance if you will I could go down the route of writing this in Phing or a CI script but Id like it done quick and dirty while in development and this solution still wouldnt produce a consolidated code report.p  pBasically, I want something like this, but rather than run the tests, I want it to run the individual phpunit.xml files within each module. Is this possiblep  precodeltxml version1.0 encodingUTF8gt  ltphpunitgt     lttestsuitesgt         lttestsuite nameSite Testsgt             ltdirectorygt.moduleApplicationtestApplicationTestltdirectorygt             ltdirectorygt.moduleUsertestUserTestltdirectorygt         lttestsuitegt     lttestsuitesgt ltphpunitgt codepre  pstrongUpdatestrongp  pThe aim is to have code metrics generated by PHPUnit that give a project overview, not a modular specific overview. I appreciate the scripts in the answers will run the unit tests on a permodule basis but this is not what Im looking for. I understand that this may be a limitation as far as PHPUnit is concerned. I will look into this over the next few days and try and find a solution as it seems like something that would be useful in a lot of projects that deal with custom modules.p  pstrongUpdate 2strongp  pRobert Basic came up with a script that creates a directory structure with the module reports inside and it works great but would be nice to have it running within PHPUnit with the proper metrics reporting.p  pa hrefhttpsgist.github.comrobertbasic5329789 relnofollowhttpsgist.github.comrobertbasic5329789ap

Negative 96 pIm learning JQM and codeBackbone.jscode and I have a few problems. Im making a recipe app following the TODO list example trying to blend them both.p  pAnyway I cant refresh any page besides the first one, Im getting undefined variables. I believe it has to do with the DOM and many views I have. Secondly Upon entering the recipe to search for to query the API, it displays the results first as plain links p  pIf I got forward a page or back a page and return to the results page it display the links as they should be the JQM style. This is because I couldnt figure how or what to append to in the JS, so I did it in the HTML. p  pI know this is a long shot but can anyone give me guidance as to what the hell Im doing wrong, general

All that I need to do is create an image from this array and set it as the background in this Xscreensaver.p  pHow do I generate an image from this array  Ive looked into using purely Xlib, but thats a daunting task.  So if theres a way to use Cairo to generate the image from the array that would be nice.  Also, the values in the array are between 0 and 1.p

Then we save these 6 characters in the database, and when get it back to the screen the Chinese character is back. Works finep  pBut, when we receive the 6 characters that arent Chinese in the server, we would need to call a web service that only receive UTF8 characters.How can I convert the original 3 Chinese GB2312, thatre in the HTML page characters in UTF8p  pI dont know if the characters will be show in the forum, but Ill tryp  pIn the HTML form p  pReceived in the Weblogic server p

Negative 96 pI am working on a path finding algorithm for a battle game. The game has concepts of buildingstarget enclosed by wallsobstacles. Soldiers are deployed outside the walls. So in case walls have a gap through which soldiers can pass they will find the path using some path finding algorithm. I have implemented Jump Point Search algo for this purpose, and my algo is working fine. Now I want to extend the algorithm so that in case no path is available it returns me path to the wallobstacle closest to the target. As a test I kept a bestPoint. Initially bestPoint in my start pointpoint where soldier is deployed. As Jump Point searches various points any point with less heuristic score that the previous best point is saved in bestPoint as new best point. Eventually if no path is found path is backtraced from last best point. This seems to work for some cases, but in others the soldiers move to odd places on grid. Any better ideas for the said problem p

Negative 96 pSo I figure the definition of real time updatescommunication is when updates made by one user are relayed to other users subscribed to the object as soon as they are made. p  pbut this is not instantaneousdata takes finite time to travel.

So you can have delay of t1t2d in case of sockets. d is the time taken for server to notice event happened internally and propogate itdepends on CPU power My question is is there any established benchmarkstandard that defines how small d should be for the communication to be realtime.p  pOr is realtime just a general term we throw around daily This is out of sheer curiosity rather than any application. I am just curious if there are any established standards for realtime data.p

Negative 96 pIve written a small graphics engine for my game that has multiple canvases in a treethese basically represent layers. Whenever something in a layer changes, the engine marks the affected layers as soiled and in the render code the lowest affected layer is copied to its parent via drawImage, which is then copied to its parent and so on up to the root layerthe onscreen canvas. This can result in multiple drawImage calls per frame but also prevents rerendering anything below the affected layer. However, in frames where nothing changes no rendering or drawImage calls take place, and in frames where only foreground objects move, rendering and drawImage calls are minimal.p  pId like to compare this to using multiple onscreen canvases as layers, as described in this articlep  pa hrefhttpwww.ibm.comdeveloperworkslibrarywacanvashtml5layering relnofollowhttpwww.ibm.comdeveloperworkslibrarywacanvashtml5layeringap  pIn the onscreen canvas approach, we handle rendering on a perlayer basis and let the browser handle displaying the layers on screen properly. From the research Ive done and everything Ive read, this seems to be generally accepted as likely more efficient than handling it manually with drawImage. So my question is, can the browser determine what needs to be rerendered more efficiently than I can, despite my insider knowledge of exactly what has changed each framep  pI already know the answer to this question is Do it both ways and benchmark. But in order to get accurate data I need realworld application, and that is months away. By then if I have an acceptable approach I will have bigger fish to fry. So Im hoping someone has been down this road and can provide some insight into this.p

Negative 96 pIm attempting to separate my DbContext from a winforms application that Im currently using to better support a multiuser environment as well as an upcoming website.  After doing a bit of research Ive going with implementing a data access layer DAL for the winforms appwebsite to connect to and having the endusers work with disconnected entities.  My question is regarding the best way I would go about saving updates to my entities when one of the entities in a child collection has been updated.  p  pFor instance, if I have the following structure simplifiedp  precodepublic class Company      public int CompanyID  get set      public string CompanyName  get set      public ICollectionltEmployeegt Employees  get set    Nonvirtual as we arent lazyloading   public class Employee      public int CompanyID  get set      public int EmployeeID  get set      public string FirstName  get set      public string LastName  get set      public ICollectionltClaimgt Claims  get set    public class Claim      public DateTime ClaimDate  get set      public ICollection Documentation  get set    public class Document      public byte[] DocumentImage  get set      public string Name  get set      public DateTime CreateDate  get set   codepre  pInside the winforms application, I have multiple Binding Sources setup to display the employees informationp  pFor Examplep  precodeemployeeBinding.DataSource  typeofEmployee    Eventually set to an IEnumerableltEmployeegt claimBinding.DataSource  employeeBinding claimBinding.DataMember  Claims documentationBinding.DataSource  claimBinding documentationBinding.DataMember  Documentation codepre  pHowever, by setting things up like this Im unable to make calls on the CurrentChanged event of each binding source to save each entity since it has changed unless I have references stored to the previous entity inside the form.  So what I have thought to do was something similar to below in the DAL and iterate through each of the child collections.  p  precodepublic void UpdateEmployeeEmployee employee      using myContext context  new myContext          context.Employees.Attachemployee      context.EntryltEmployeegtemployee.State  EntityState.Modified       foreachvar claim in employee.Claims               context.EntryltClaimgtclaim.State  EntityState.Modified        foreachvar doc in claim.Documentation                  context.EntryltDocumentgtdoc.State  EntityState.Modified                    context.SaveChanges       codepre  pHowever, I feel that this route can get ugly quick with some more complex entities and relationships.  Could someone help point me to the best route to handle this or should I have references to the current entities in the code so when the CurrentChanged event fires I can just update each individual entity  p  pThank you very much.p

Negative 96 pWe have a ASP.NET website for which users are authenticated using Basic authentication along with SSL configured in IIS. The user accounts are stored in Active directory. Currently when users try to navigate to the site, they are presented with login prompt thrown by IIS and once the details are entered, they are allowed in if the credentials are correct. All this is taken care of automatically by IIS and Active directory. But we have a new requirement to expire the password after some x number of days and if user tries to login after the password is expired, then we need to show change password dialog after user logs in. But I am not sure how this is possible, because once the password is expired and if I try to login after that, then login prompt is displayed again and again. Is there any option in IIS or somewhere else to show change password dialog to the user once password is expired Just like how it works for windows passwords Though we can warn the user when the password is about to expire and provide an option to change it before it expires through a custom page, it will be nice to redirect the user to change password dialog after it is expired as well, so that it doesnt need to be reset manually by the customer support team. p

Negative 96 pIve got a rather large and rather old C application that has been ported to Linux. Im in charge of getting mouse cursors to work correctly, but having some issues.

XDefineCursorgDisplay, WHostWindoww, gCursorTable[cursor] XFlushgDisplay codepre  pThis is fine for cursors which have analogs in the extremely limited list of useful cursors that XFontCursor provides, but there are other built in themed cursors that Id like to set. For example, Id like to be able to set the cursor to bddoublearrow which is included in every cursor theme and is the standard diagonal sizing cursor for windows in my app, but you obviously cant do that with XCreateFontCursor. This seems pretty basic, but for the life of me I cant find any description on how to do it.p  pI just want to know how other X11 apps are setting cursors, because they are obviously getting them from a global theme and not just using XCreateFontCursor.p

Negative 96 pI was tasked at work to create a web application strongviewable in Firefox on Linuxstrong that displays results in a tabular format using data exposed by a WCF service written in C hosted on a separate Windows 7 machine on the same network.  Rather than returning formatted HTML, the WCF service returns structs and it will be up to the client application to take these objects, pull out the data, and format it.p  pUnfortunately, it has been a couple years since I have worked with any sort of web technologies.  strongWhat is the best approach to solve this problem  Is there anything more current than RESTAJAXJSONjQuery technologiesstrong  If anyone can point out some helpful and current resources on the proper way to accomplish this, it would be most appreciated.p

Negative 96 pIm starting to work with uniqueidentifiers, and Im encountering an unexpected issue.p  pFirst of all, where Id typically use SCOPEIDENTITY, this is no longer possible with a uniqueidentifier, even though in concept it still involves an autogenerated id value as a result of the default newid or newsequentialid constraint.p  pI decided to use the OUTPUT clause in the INSERT statement to output the UUID to a table variable.  Now that I think about it, the OUTPUT clause renders SCOPEIDENTITY obsolete, considering its a much clearer and more powerful way to achieve the same thing and more e.g. gain clear and direct access to multiple autogenerated columns for all inserted rows.p  pWith the use of OUTPUT, however, Im now wondering how that affects the test of rowcount that would typically follow an insert.  Will the rowcount reflect the number of rows inserted in the main statement or the number of rows inserted into the table variable by the output clausep  pYou might think it wouldnt make a difference i.e. the count should be the same either way, but it does make a difference, because the a hrefhttptechnet.microsoft.comenuslibraryms177564.aspx relnofollowdocumentationa says that the OUTPUT clause will return values and populate the table even if the insert statement fails.p  blockquote   pAn UPDATE, INSERT, or DELETE statement that has an OUTPUT clause will   return rows to the client even if the statement encounters errors and   is rolled back. The result should not be used if any error occurs when   you run the statement.p blockquote  pIt does mention that rowcount in particular will always reflect the outermost statement only when using OUTPUT, but it mentions this is context of a nested query.  Since the OUTPUT clause in my case is part of the outermost statement, its unclear whether rowcount will report the number of rows inserted into the output table if the insert statement fails.p  pre classlangsql prettyprintoverridecode    declare newuuid TABLE ID uniqueidentifier     insert into Users ID, PersonID, Username, Password, Notes, Enabled     output INSERTED.UUID into newuuid         values id, personid, username, password, notes, enabled      if rowcount ltgt 1 goto fail does this reflect rows inserted into Users or newuuid  What if the insert fails, and rows are still output to newuuid codepre

Negative 96 pI am new in javascript and php. I am creatng an admin panel in which I have an option for the user to play game. But the issue is, every game have a specific time period say 30 mins. So, what I want is that if a user have started the game, the count down must be started and if user once switch from that page to another page, still the counter must be counting and after 30 mins it should end the game. p  pFor example  I am on codehttpwww.examplec.comGame1code my count down of 30 min will start. If I switch from that page to another like codehttpwww.example.comordercode then the counter should  still count the total time and when its expired, end it and send query to database.p  pKindly reply if anyone know the solution.

Not too bad, but it seems to drop the resources out of the cache fairly aggressively on my live server.

Negative 96 pI have table rows where, when hovered over, the row appears transparent by changing the opacity level. I need text to appear over the center of the row when row is hovered. During the hover event, I change the position of a span tag to be over the row. That works fine. The problem is that if the user hovers over the new text, the leave hover event kicks off for the row, and I get a flashing kind of effect.p  pIs there anyway, when the new text is hovered over, to have the leave hover event for the row to not get kicked offp  p I did it this way because, if I included the text as a tag inside the row itself, the text would take the same opacity level as the rest of the row.

Negative 96 pIm trying to implement vertical navigation in my app full screen fragments that you can swipe up and down. Problem is that theres no possibility to set vertical direction for android ViewPager, so Ive used Jakes Wharton DirectionalViewPager that actually works, but I cannot apply pageTransformer to it its just not implemented there and that feature implementation fix is too hard for me to do. DirectionalViewPager is no longer supported. So my question is is a viewpager the best solution for solving that kind of UI problem or maybe I should use another approach which is easier and quite easy to apply Im total newbie in android programming I came here from javascript development and I need some advice on that. Perhaps someone had similar problem and solved it somehow Thanks in advancep

Negative 96 pI have a MVC 3 web application more like a subapplication, really that does not rely on ASPNET for authentication because that is already being used in another area of the app and we are using a different type of credentialing. At any rate, I decided to create my own authentication system with its own SQL table, which is working fine on one form in the app. Now, I am trying to roll it into the shared layout, calling a Login action in the home controller. The problem I am having is how to return from that Login action back to wherever the user is. When I try return View it understandably tries to return to a HomeLogin view, which doesnt exist.

Negative 96 pstrongUPDATEstrong The problem has been solved using the code provided by Pradeep, specifically the clearfix code. I asked this question in search of a way of keeping my wrapper codeltdivgtcode behind all of my content, i.e. extend its height to the full height of all its children, and considered using a moving codeltdivgtcode where in reality my problem was fully discussed in a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions8554043whatisclearfixWhat is clearfixa and in a hrefhttpthemergency.comcssclearfixdemystified relnofollowCSS clearfix demystifieda.p  pEssentialy my container codeltdivgtcode had floating elements within that were expanding past the bottom of my wrapper. I wanted the wrapper to be behind all of my content so that users could read the text that was on top. Applying this new CSS class codeclearfixcode to my wrapper codeltdivgtcode the problem was solved but a new one created. I lost the ability to center the codeltdivgtcode on the page, which I did not state in my original question below. The solution to being able to center it again without losing the clearfix solution was to use a parent codeltdivgtcode that has codemarginleft autocode and codemarginright autocode set.

Negative 96 pI am querying the taxonomy terms and then listing the posts that are under those terms. The taxonomy is basically a category for a custom post type, and the terms in it are the categories. p  pI didnt think this was possible, but I have a foreach loop that is supposed to loop through each termcategory from the query and then list the termscategories on the page and then list the posts in those termscategories underneath them, and the issue is that it is listing the posts from all categoriesterms under every category. So I am getting multiples of each post. The posts are only added under one category.p  pI couldnt figure out why it was duplicating the posts until I accidently tried getting a variables value for the category description before it was even declared, when I seen that it did not get the descriptions value for the first category but it did the second one, I knew it was getting multiple categories posts at once for the single foreach loop.

Negative 96 pI am developing a TCP protocol fuzzing software under Windows 7. I wanna to send self constructed TCP packet using Raw Sockets. But it seems that Microsoft forbid this for some security reasons. a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibrarywindowsdesktopms740548vvs.85.aspx relnofollowhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibrarywindowsdesktopms740548vvs.85.aspxap  pI know WinPcap can also send custom packets. But I dont want to build a packet from the Ethernet level. The parameters for Ethernet and IPv4 are so complex and drive me crazy. I only cares about the TCP above parts.

Negative 96 pIm very new to R and trying to start organising my data set.p  pIm working on observational data encoded from videos of behavioural experiments. The output is one single column with all the entries listed in temporal order, like thisp  precodeSD3 No string start Open lid End state End trial String start Open lid End state End trial String start Touch knob A Remove string Open lid End state End trial No string start Open lid End state Clapping hands End trial SD4 String start Touch knob B Touch knob B Touch knob B Open lid End state End trial No string start Touch knob B Touch knob A Remove string Remove string Touch knob B End trial No string start Open lid End state End trial String start Touch knob B Touch knob A Remove string Touch knob B End trial codepre  pThis is the version with the spelled out labels, but of course these could be easily substitutes with single letters or numbers.p  pIn order to analyse the data I would need to divide this column into different groups. Ive done it in Excel, but it requires lots of time and some steps need to be done by hand. I would like to find a practical way of doing it in R but I havent found one yet.p  pWhat I think I would need is a way to assign a new variable to each row, based on something that was preceedingfollowing that row. Es. all the rows following SD3 the ID label but before SD4, need to be assigned a SD3 variable to be later on grouped based on this.p  pMore difficult for me to work on is the division of the column into smaller groups each participant was given 4 trials. I would need to separate each trial identifying it with a new variable  putting it into a separate column or other similar solutions so that it can be analysed separately later.p  pIn the example above, I would need to have an output like thisp  precodeSD3 No string start  SD3  trial1 Open lid  SD3  trial1 End state  SD3  trial1 End trial  SD3  trial1 String start  SD3  trial2 Open lid  SD3  trial2 End state  SD3  trial2 End trial  SD3  trial2 String start  SD3  trial3 Touch knob A  SD3  trial3 Remove string  SD3  trial3 Open lid  SD3  trial3 End state  SD3  trial3 End trial  SD3  trial3 No string start  SD3  trial4 Open lid  SD3  trial4 End state  SD3  trial4 Clapping hands  SD3  trial4 End trial  SD3  trial4 SD4 String start  SD4  trial1 Touch knob B  SD4  trial1 Touch knob B  SD4  trial1 Touch knob B  SD4  trial1 Open lid  SD4  trial1 End state  SD4  trial1 End trial  SD4  trial1 No string start  SD4  trial2 Touch knob B  SD4  trial2 Touch knob A  SD4  trial2 Remove string  SD4  trial2 Remove string  SD4  trial2 Touch knob B  SD4  trial2 End trial  SD4  trial2 No string start  SD4  trial3 Open lid  SD4  trial3 End state  SD4  trial3 End trial  SD4  trial3 String start  SD4  trial4 Touch knob B  SD4  trial4 Touch knob A  SD4  trial4 Remove string  SD4  trial4 Touch knob B  SD4  trial4 End trial  SD4  trial4 codepre  pMany thanks Rebecca sorry if my English is not great, I hope this is clearp

All I can see is  that it takes only one.

Negative 96 pThe setup is a little complicated so I will try my best to detail it.p  pFirst I am attempting to use openCLopenGL interop. The code works when the interop clImageGL is not used so the basics are there. The project is using 3 main openGL context took a lot to get the openCL context to open in that. I am using QGLWidgets for the context. There is a hidden QGLWidget created first and the other 2 share the hiddens context. Each of the 2 QGLWidgets are running in their own threads. The hidden QGLWidget is transfer to a thread where the openCL context is created.p  precodeQGLFormat qglFormat qglFormat.setVersion3, 3  qglFormat.setProfileQGLFormatCoreProfile  mhiddenGlnew GLHiddenWidgetqglFormat mhiddenGlgtsetVisiblefalse  mview1new GLWidgetqglFormat, mhiddenGl mview2new GLWidgetqglFormat, mhiddenGl  ...

From this point several kernels are executed sequentially on incoming data which is images. All of the kernels succeed no errors however the one kernel using a openGL texture to write out data fails to write anything. When using an openCL clImage2d it works fine produces the correct output even if the openCL context is created as interop.p  pThe openGL texture is created after all of the openGL contexts are created and after the openCL context is created also in the same thread as the openCL context. At the beginning of the processThread the texture is generated by the hidden QGLWidget with glGenTextures. Then all of the kernels are created along with other openCL buffers and images. Right before the kernel is executed the following is done.p  precodeifinitBuffer runs only if buffer size is changed, allways runs first time      mhiddenGlgtmakeCurrent      glBindTextureGLTEXTURE2D, mtexture      I have attempted to put data in, result is always black from kernel     glTexImage2DGLTEXTURE2D, 0, GLRGBA, width, height, 0, GLRGBA, GLUNSIGNEDBYTE, NULL      glTexParameteriGLTEXTURE2D, GLTEXTUREWRAPS, GLREPEAT     glTexParameteriGLTEXTURE2D, GLTEXTUREWRAPT, GLREPEAT     glTexParameteriGLTEXTURE2D, GLTEXTUREMAGFILTER, GLLINEAR      glTexParameteriGLTEXTURE2D, GLTEXTUREMINFILTER, GLLINEAR     glBindTextureGLTEXTURE2D, 0      glFinish      mflags is CLMEMREADWRITE     mimageGLclImageGLmopenCLContext, mflags, GLTEXTURE2D, 0, mtexture, amperror  codepre  pand a simplified kernel.p  precodekernel void kernel1readonly image2dt src1, readonly image2dt src2, writeonly image2dt dst      int2 coordint2getglobalid0, getglobalid1     uint4 value255      writeimageuidst, coord, convertuint4value  codepre  pEven if I do not display the texture the image is still black.

Negative 96 pSo I have specification tables that relate to products that vary by product type.

I will explain in more detail...p  pEach spec table has a different number of columns and rows, for that matter. Lets say one of them has 50,000 rows and a manufacturer column. Now lets assume there are 5 unique manufacturers in the there as well. Lets also assume the same table also has a color column that shares 7 colors among all 50,000 rows.p  pMy currently imaginary stored procedure should return one row with the following columns...p  ul libManufacturerb brManu1,Manu2,Manu3,Manu4,Manu5li libColorb brcolor1,color2,color3,color4,color5,color6,color7li ul  pI intend to use this result to build my site navigation.p

I have to set the throttling rates on a per UserGroup basis. p  pWe are currently using memcached with default configuration as the cache backend, which is persite cache.p  pWhile making some simple tests with AnonRateThrottle and UserRateThrottle, I notice that if the requests that the user is making is already cache it doesnt count for the throttle rates. p  pThe documentation says that throttling is determined before running the main body of the view, i guess because the requests is being serve from the cache the view is not being executed so throttle is not take into account.p  pBasically i wanna askp  p1 Is this whats really happening  2 Could there be a way to count the cache requests for throttling purposes pros and cons if you couldp  pOne thing I thought of was caching only the databaseOrm lookups, so that every request executes the corresponding view body.p  pProbably the number of requests that exceeds the throttling rate is not that great, and because theyre cached they dont impact the performance of the service, so basically i just want to know the behavior of the service in this case.  p

Negative 96 pI have an existing WCF service that uses TransportWithMessageCredential security.

This is all configured from within the web.config in bindings  behaviors and all works fine.p  pHowever, we have a requirement to add a new method to this service specifically for a new vendor, and Im being told this new vendor uses a Java client and will not be able to figure out how to authenticate with the credentials in the header, like is required for all the other methods in this service.  p  pSo Ive been asked to simply take a username and password as arguments to the new method instead, and use those to manually authenticate against our user store in the database.p  pMy question is, since they want this method included in the same service that requires authentication for every other method, is it possible to implement it that way so a single method is exempt from the authorization  authentication policy that all the other methods requirep

Negative 96 pOkay, I understand that OpenID Connect is about authentication and oAuth2.0 is about authorization and OpenID Connect is built on top of oAuth2.0. I also understand the difference between these two terms. p  pI am creating a web app which is also an oAuth2.0 client.

Negative 96 pCurrently, we have one database instance for all of our integration testing. The oracle database schema is synced by a bunch of DDLs. Then we use DBunit to populate and truncate the tables in between tests. There are two issues with this approachp  ol liThe time spent preparing the database is more than what is spent testingli liOn occasion, usually a test failure, test data bleeds over to a subsequent test and causes more failures.li ol  pI want to isolate the tests by creating an inmemory database such as h2 per test. I plan on configuring EclipseLink to generate the DDL because converting the oracle DDL to something else will be a nightmare Id imagine. The only issue at that point would be to create triggers. p  pSo I have two questions...p  ol liCould I create an inmemory database h2 or whatever off of an existing oracle schema, triggers includedli liOr, can I create an in memory database using my entitymanager DDL generation and create a bunch of triggers on the fly, but prior to test executionli ol  pTechnology stackp  ul liSpring 3.2.8 li liSpring Data JPA 1.5.3 li liEclipse Link 2.5.1 li liOracle 11li ul  pI am familiar with how to instantiate a Spring Test Integration environment to load up an inmemory database. Just not sure how I can translate the oracle stuff triggers, specifically.p

Negative 96 pI admit Im a bit stumped why this is not working.p  pI have an input that I am masking and that is working perfectly, however it seems if you select the text then it reveals the real value.p  pTo solve this, I would like to disable the user from being able to highlight the text in the input. Before you say this is bad usability, Im working on touchscreens only and this will really just stop it from highlighting if they click too many times.p  pI have tried puttingp  precodewebkituserselect none    mozuserselect none      msuserselect none        userselect none codepre  pon both inputs, but it still wants to select.

Negative 96 pI am creating an app where users can store an object in Core Data.  I have the Objects being pulled into a UITableView and everything is working correctly there.  I now want to separate the objects into a possible of 13 different sections based on choices in a UISegmentedControl.p  pCurrently I have this to create the 1 section and populate the cells of that section with my objectsp  precodepragma mark  Table view data source   NSIntegernumberOfSectionsInTableViewUITableView tableView       Return the number of sections.     return 1    NSIntegertableViewUITableView tableView numberOfRowsInSectionNSIntegersection       Return the number of rows in the section.     return self.fetchedDiscs.count     UITableViewCell tableViewUITableView tableView cellForRowAtIndexPathNSIndexPath indexPath      static NSString CellIdentifier  DiscCell     UITableViewCell cell  [tableView dequeueReusableCellWithIdentifierCellIdentifier forIndexPathindexPath]      Configure Cell     Disc currentDisc  [self.fetchedDiscs objectAtIndexindexPath.row]      cell.textLabel.text  currentDisc.name     cell.detailTextLabel.text  currentDisc.brand      return cell  codepre  pSo the main question is how to dynamically change the number of sections and number of rows in sectionp  pThe Segmented control returns values such as   Option 1, Option 2, Option 3.  The only way I can think of is to loop through my fetchedDiscs array and separate that into an array for each section.  Then I can return the number of arrays if they exists and I can get the count of each array to get the number of rows in each section.   But then I get to the problem of How to get the CellForRowAtIndextPath to work correctly with three arrays.p  pBasically there has to be a better more logical way to do this.  I am just not sure how.p
Negative 96 pI just started playing with Azure DocumentDB and my excitement has turned into confusion. This thing is weird. It seems like everything databases, collections, documents needs to be accessed not by its id, but by its SelfLink. For examplep  pI create a databasep  precodepublic void CreateDatabase      using var client  new DocumentClientnew Uriendpoint, authKey              Database db  new Database                      Id  TestDB,                  client.CreateDatabaseAsyncdb.Wait       codepre  pThen later sometime I want to create a Collectionp  precodepublic void CreateCollection      using var client  new DocumentClientnew Uriendpoint, authKey              DocumentCollection collection  new DocumentCollection                      Id  TestCollection,                  client.CreateDocumentCollectionAsyncdatabaseLink , documentCollection collection.Wait       codepre  pThe api wants a databaseLink when what Id really prefer to give it is my database Id. I dont have the databaseLink handy. Does DocumentDB really expect me to pull down a list of all databases and go searching through it for the databaseLink everytime I want to do anythingp  pThis problem goes all the way down. I cant save a document to a collection without having the collections link.p  precodepublic void CreateDocument      using var client  new DocumentClientnew Uriendpoint, authKey              client.CreateDocumentAsyncdocumentCollectionLink , document new  Name  TestName .Wait       codepre  pSo to save a document I need the collections link. To get the collections link I need the database link. To get the database link I have to pull down a list of all databases in my account and go sifting through it. Then I have to use that database link that I found to pull down a list of collections in that database that I then have to sift through looking for the link of the collection I want. This doesnt seem right.p  pAm I missing something Am I not understanding how to use this Why am I assigning ids to all my resources when DocumentDB insists on using its own link scheme to identify everything My question is how do I access DocumentDB resources by their Idp

Negative 96 pOur developer left a few weeks ago, so I have been attempting to get myself a little more acquainted with the systems and troubleshoot a few issues around the site. p  pI attempted to look at our log files in varlog before realizing that they are, erm, several GB each. Despite knowing almost nothing about how big an ideal log file should be, the fact that this file very handily crashed my computer seems like maybe its too big. Before my computer crashed, I could see that there are records in the file that are over five months old. p  pstrongIs it safe to simply delete system.log and exception.logstrong p  pWhen I search for this, I get a lot of results related to Log Cleaning... p  pIn Magento there are settings under System to turn on Log Cleaning, but I suspect that has nothing to do with these two log files because a it looks like it is set to clear it daily and b cron is set up. If I am incorrect about that, please let me know so I can look into why that is not working correctly.p
Negative 96 pI would like to start off with a note. I tried using a jsfiddle but for some reason HTML5 canvas does not work. So as a workaround I used a hrefhttpjsbin.comgugihuwegopa1 relnofollowhttpjsbin.comgugihuwegopa1a. To edit with this site, click the edit button at the top right corner of the window. Anyway, my problem is, when the paddle is not moving, the ball bounces correctly off all sides The codenomovecode variable has nothing to do with that, its just to make it disappear with the w key. However, when I move the paddle with the mouse towards the ball, it gets stuck inside the paddle. I think this is because it is not updating the location of the paddle fast enough so that the ball ends up inside of it, and my code continues to cause the ball to bounce even while inside. until moving the paddle rapidly away and it gets unstuck. Yes I have tried putting the codecxt.fillRectcode before the codecxt.arccode. Sometimes the ball will travel through the paddle as well. I figure a way to fix this would be factoring in the direction of the ball in my two codeifcode statementsp  precodeifyymovegtw ampamp yymoveltwh ampamp xgts ampamp xltsl  ymove1 top and bottom ifxxmovegts ampamp xxmoveltsl ampamp yymoveltwh ampamp yymovegtw  xmove1 left and right codepre  pSome other methods I have tried includep  precode    ifyymovegtw ampamp yymoveltwh ampamp xgts ampamp xltsl ampamp centerY17.5 lt yymove5 ampamp centerX12.5 lt xxmove5 ymove1 top and bottom, extra 5 for radius     ifxxmovegts ampamp xxmoveltsl ampamp yymoveltwh ampamp yymovegtw ampamp centerX12.5 lt xxmove5 ampamp centerY17.5 lt yymove5 xmove1 left and right codepre  pSo basically I just need the ball to bounce correctly no matter how I move the paddle.

Negative 96 pSo, Ive been working on an Android app for a class, which is why some of the things I want to do seem a bit contrived. I have a ListView, and each row in the ListView contains a custom GLSurfaceView. These GLSurfaceViews are supposed to react to touchdrag events. However, whenever I drag my finger vertically over the GLSurfaceView, the ListView scrolls vertically, and theres no effect to be seen from the GLSurfaceView. It seems like the ListView just consumes the drag event. I want the ListView to scroll normally, except when Im trying to interact with the GLSurfaceView.p  pIve tried returning false from the GLSurfaceViews OnTouch method, which didnt work. This must mean that the ListView gets the first crack at the touch event. Is there any way for me to route touch events through the GLSurfaceView before the ListViewp

Negative 96 pIn the simple javascript dropin UI, when the a hrefhttpsdevelopers.braintreepayments.comjavascriptjavastarthelloclient relnofollowforma is being submitted, braintree.js will intercept the form submission and inserts a hidden field named paymentmethodnonce into the form, before the submission actually goes to the server.p  pHowever, when using the AngularJS as the frontend framework, I generally dont want the form submission to directly go to the server and then do a page reload. Instead, I want my AngularJS function to intercept and deal with the form submission e.g., via ngclick or ngsubmit, AND in its processing it needs to retrieve and use the paymentmethodnonce value.p  pI tried it and it can still intercept the form submission. However, it seems like AngularJS intercepts the form submission BEFORE braintree.js does and inserts the paymentmethodnonce field.p  pHence, my AngularJS code that responds to the form submission cannot retrieve that paymentmethodnonce field and perform appropriate processing.

Ive been tackling this for almost 2 days straight and Im nowhere closer the solution then when I was at the time I started. I reverted the code to the original version before trying out the code I found in the above mentioned links. I did try those solutions as well as quite a few others, but none of them seem to have worked.p  pIs there any way to set up the child elements to have a on focus indicator For example like the one Ive provided in buttonnavigationtv.xml to have a black borderline indicating that the user is currerntly on that item Curenntly Im not getting any focus indicator and cant seem to enable it no matter what I do.p
Negative 96 pIm new to Shiny and struggling considerably.p  pI need to give my Shiny users the ability to download a data file essentially querying a database. The query goes from one time to another. Shiny supports dates natively, but not time so I have to give the users a text field with a codesubmitButtoncodep  pThe problem is I need to have the submit button do a validation test on both text inputs, and the either 1 Return an error message if either input is not valid 2 Download the data, while giving status updates data can take an hour easilyI do not want to leave users hanging.p  pI discovered something called coderenderPrintcode that seemed like a good option, in that it purports to output what has print to the consolethen I can either print an error message or display the normal console output from the data download process. But then it holds the printed output until the whole process is done. p  pIm thinking another possible solution would be to go back to renderText and then render text directly from the codequeryMagiccode functionas it goes through the data download process, it can periodically update codeoutputtextcode with new text.

Negative 96 pIt will become clear as you read that I have very little experience programming please excuse me for an elementary question. I have on the storyboard the template for a tab based app. which has two view controllers both of which have a web view on them and both seem to be working fine. As I needed a third tab I dragged a view controller onto the storyboard and linked it to the tab bar controller, I also created a thirdViewContoller.swift file which was copied from one of the other two which was in the template. Ran the app and everything works fine. I now drag a UiWebView onto the third view controller and unlike the other two when I try to control drag the webView to the code it will not link up. What am I missing. Many thanks for any help.p

Negative 96 pIve been going around in circles today trying to figure out the best approach, but Im still lost. Hoping someone here or the Telerik forums has the answer.p  pMy user has a group of records with dates. I need to send a single push notification to the user for each unique date in that data.p  pI can create this push notification on the client side appbuilder hybrid app when a record is created. However, the client sdk for notifications only exposes create, not read or delete. That means p  ol liI cant make sure theres only one notification per device, even if there are multiple records with the same date.li liI cant changeremove the existing push notification if the date in a record is changed.li ol  pI thought about using Telerik Cloud Code for Data... But the sdk doesnt expose readdelete. Id have to read all notifications for that User Id from the REST service and then determine which need to be updatedremoved. That sounds like a mess of code for a scenario which I would consider somewhat normal. Im also concerned about timing out, since theres a 5 second limit on cloud code for data.p  pSo, whats the best way to manage my push notifications in Telerik backend servicesp

Negative 96 pIve spent the last couple days researching different arguments for and against different MVC frameworks but whats become very apparent is that theres absolutely no correct answer to this question as its heavily dependent on a number of different factors specific to the underlying project.p  pThe advice I am repeatedly coming across is select a framework on the following points Ease of use, productivity, testability, community, documentationp  pWhile thats all well and good advice, I still think that there are a few more things to consider specific to the actual codebase youll be working on.p  pThat being said, hypothetically if you were to arrive at work one day and asked to select the best Javascript MVC framework for your code base to handle the entire front end of an existing product keeping in mind that there is a current codebase and youd want the framework to be able to handle the transition period as you shifted to the new framework over time, what are the factorsquestions you believe would be necessary to consider to make a well informed decision These can be factorsconsiderationsquestions about the MVC frameworks themselves ANDOR the current code base  technologies current in use ie. Ruby backend, other libraries currently in use, product functionality, etc.p  pScalability and performance are extremely important as this product would have a fairly large volume of users.p  pJust due to stability and maturity of certain frameworks alone Ive factored down realistic choices to Angular, Backbone  Marionette and Ember although this one is still up in the air.  Each one is a different beast by its own right and functions very differently, hence the need for my original question on what factors and questions would you ask to figure out which is the ideal I use that word very loosely choicep

Negative 96 pI am regularly following i.e. reading almost entirely an online magazine, which to my dismay does not provide any suitable view for linear reading like e.g. a printerfriendly view but only a page containing a table of content an HTML list containing links to each chapter which one then needs to click on individually and  after reading the childpage  the back button again to return to the TOC.p  pI find the manual traversal of such a tree increasingly cumbersome and also very slow due to the surrounding overhead that is loaded with each child page. I am thus considering to program me some tool or script that traverses that table of content automatically, loads each child page, extracts the relevant content and concatenates it, i.e. composes essentially a single linear page or HTMLdocument containing the entire magazines content, so one could conveniently and linearly read it or maybe even print it....p  pI have analyzed the involved HTML pages a bit and in my opinion it should be possible to locate the table of contents with all the links and the content sections of the childpages using a few carefully crafted XPATHexpressions, since all the relevant pieces are contained in ltdiv ...gtelements with specific names or rather class attributes. p  pMy first questions thus does such a tool maybe already exist that one could parameterize accordingly to do such a table of contentbased treetraversal, extraction and concatenation I googled quite a bit but couldnt find anything readymade.p  pAssuming there is no such tool my second question is what would be a suitable approach to implement such a tool Clearly one would need to parse many HTML pages, locate specific elements within them and extract and concatenate the located HTMLfragments into a new document.p  pWhat computer language would be best suited to do that job I am a Java programmer by profession, but doing all that XMLparsing and textfiddling in Java seems not very elegant to me. I could imagine that there are programming languages out there that are much more elegant and better suited for this kind of task. Suggestionsp  pOr last if Java is indeed a reasonable choice for this task what easytouse and robust libraries are there to parse essentially arbitrary HTML pages into a DOM, such that an XPATHprocessor can then operate on it  All XMLparsers that I have worked with so far, would require me to first specify a full and robust schema before they would allow me to process arbitrary XHTML pages. I fancy that creating such a schema would already be a formidable task in itself. Is there some HTMLparser out there that can create a suitable DOM without the need to create such a schemap  pOr any other suggestions how to approach or solve this problemp  pHope I could make myself clear...p

It compiles, you can paste it into a fresh new form.p  precodevoid Form2Paintobject sender, PaintEventArgs e      var gfx  e.Graphics      System.Diagnostics.Debug.WriteLineDpiX0, DpiY1, gfx.DpiX, gfx.DpiY      gfx.PageUnit  GraphicsUnit.Inch      var pen  new PenColor.Black, 0.01f       Create outer container, 2 inches in size with X and Y set to 0.1 inches     var outerContainer  gfx.BeginContainer         new RectangleF0.1f, 0.1f, 2, 2,         new RectangleF0, 0, 2, 2,         GraphicsUnit.Pixel       Draw the outer rectangle     gfx.DrawRectanglepen, new Rectangle0, 0, 2, 2       Create inner container, 1 inch in size with X and Y set to 0.1 inches     var innerContainer  gfx.BeginContainer         new RectangleF0.1f, 0.1f, 1, 1,         new RectangleF0, 0, 1, 1,         GraphicsUnit.Pixel       Draw the inner rectangle     gfx.DrawRectanglepen, new Rectangle0, 0, 1, 1      gfx.EndContainerinnerContainer      gfx.EndContainerouterContainer  codepre  pAbove code is a pretty simple example of nested graphic containers, I used no scaling transformation. This is how the form looks like when above paint handler is usedp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comP0jKU.png altgraphics container illustrationp  pIts pretty simple. Now, I will try to describe what the problem is.p  pThis is a signature of the codeBeginContainercode methodp  precodepublic GraphicsContainer BeginContainer     RectangleF dstrect,     RectangleF srcrect,     GraphicsUnit unit  codepre  pstrongWhat Im failing to understandstrong is codeGraphicsUnit unitcode argument.p  pFrom MSDNp  blockquote   pMember of the GraphicsUnit enumeration that specifies the unit of measure for the container.p blockquote  pThis appears emnotem to be truep  pAs you can see in my code Im using Inch units as such codegfx.PageUnit  GraphicsUnit.Inchcode. p  pBut, when Im creating containers this is what Im passing as units argument to the codeBeginContainercode method codeGraphicsUnit.Pixelcode. What happens after the container is created strongInches are being usedstrong what I actually want. But if I pass codeGraphicsUnit.Inchcode or millimeters or emanythingem else to the argument, strongpixels are usedstrong. So, it seems that in order to accomplish what I want use inches I have to specify pixels p  pThis makes no sense to me. You can try changing units in codeBeginContainercode methods in above code and observe strange results. Ive read the MSDN and everything I could gather on this but I am still clueless.p  pIm writing software which draws a lot of stuff using gdi and its using millimeter units for printing purposes  when I started using containers I was quite surprised that I apparently need to specify pixels as units. Im really suspicious of any printing code where empixelsem are mentioned. It must be that I have a big misunderstanding of this matter.p  pSo, all above considered, my question is what is the purpose of the codeunitcode argument in this methodp

Negative 96 pstrongTLDRstrong What is the proper way of extending jQuery object with plugins, exposing it globally and using external AMD libs with ES6 modules in webpack Is webpack the right tool for the task, or would SystemJs suit the situation of refactoring a legacy app to ES6 modules betterp  pI am trying to wrap my head around working with webpack and ES6 modules.

It seems to be preferred to use the ProvidePlugin instead of the exposeloader. Sadly I didnt get it to work with an extended jQuery object. Neither did it work for the use of module functions invoced in codeltscriptgtcode tags.p  pI still struggle to find programatic solutions and decide which webpack plugin is the right one for the job.

Negative 96 pIve been doing a lot of research in regards to elasticsearch and I seem to be stumbling on the question of whether or not a database is needed. p  pstrongCurrent HibernateSearch and Relational Designstrongp  pMy current application is written in java using hibernate, hibernatesearch, and a mysql database. Hibernate search is built on lucene and automatically manages my indexes for me during database transactions. Hibernatesearch will also search against the index and then pull full records from the database based on the stored pks rather than having to store your entire data model in the index. This has worked wonderfully, however as my application grows, Ive continually run into scaling issues and cost do to the fact the Lucene indexes need to live on each application server and then you need another library to sync the indexes together. The other issue with this design is it requires more memory on all the application servers since the indexes are being replicated and stored with the application. p  pstrongDatabase or No Databasestrongp  pComing from the hibernatesearch school of thought, Im confused on whether or not your suppose to store your entire data model in elasticsearch and do away with the traditional database or if your suppose to store your search data in the indexes and again like hibernatesearch return primary keys to pull complete records from your relational database. p  pstrongManaging the Indexesstrongp  ol liIf your using the indexes with a a db, should you be manually     maintaining them during transactions I seen a jdbc project called     river, but it looks to be deprecated and not recommended for     production use, is there a library out there capable of     automatically handling your transactions for youli liIf your indexes fall out of sync with your db, is there a recommended way to rebuild themli ol  pstrongHibernateSearch APIstrongp  pI also seen the following in the hibernatesearch roadmap API  SPI for alternative backends a hrefhttphibernate.orgsearchroadmap relnofollowhttphibernate.orgsearchroadmapap  precodeDefine API  SPI abstraction to allow for future external backends integrations such as Apache Solr and Elastic Search. codepre  pIm wondering if anybody has any input on this Is hibernatesearch capable of managing the elastic search indexes automatically for you just as it does with its native configurationp  pstrongIf No Databasestrongp  pWhat would be the drawback of not using a database for anything search relatedp

Negative 96 pI am really new to python and I am having trouble with my outputs. I am using Ipython to write my code as well. What I want to do is synchronize two clock times. I first open a csv with a time from one source in one column and time from another source in the other column. Once I find the difference between those values I import another csv that has all the values from the time source that was lagging and add the difference so that the lagging clock is now standard with the other.  Problems 1.When I switch out the first csv to calculate another time difference e.g first csv time difference was 5 min and new csv time difference is 2 min the outputs will have 5 min added instead of 2 min. I have attached the code so you can see. 2. I also dont know how to convert the datetime objects into time objects to get rid of the 19000101. I saw forums for that but I didnt understand the code so if there is a simple way to do this I would appreciate it.p  pI know I am missing alot of basics but I appreciate the helpp  precodeimport csv from datetime import time timedifference openTEST.csv timedifferencecsvcsv.readertimedifferenceimports csv with the two       clock differences e.g wall clock and scanner clock one value in each column firstline  True for row in timedifferencecsv     if firstline    skip first line         firstline  False          continue  parse the line for row in timedifferencecsvconverts the string values of the clock    into datetimes which allows them to be subtracted and added     w  [[datetime.time.strptimei[0],HMS] [datetime.time.strptimei[1],HMS] for i in timedifferencecsv] for row in wgets the difference btwn the two clocks     p row[1]row[0] for row in w     l row[1]row[0]  row[0]  td open121Times3.csvimports csv with the list of times from one    time source e.g. just the scanner times tdcsvcsv.readertd firstline  True  for row in tdcsv     if firstline    skip first line         firstline  False         continue  parse the line for row in tdcsv     k  [[datetime.time.strptimei[0],HMS] for i in tdcsv]  for row in kadds the difference found earlier to all the times on the csv.

Negative 96 pIm saving a file with unicodekorean in its name and Im storing the name of the file in memory for bookkeeping in my app. The file is saved fine, whats bothering me is the way the name is given back to me by the OS.p  pIF I make a fcntlfd, FGETPATH, charArray call on the files fd, the filename being returned is different to the file name returned by listing out its directory contents. I did some research on the filenames returned in the two cases and found out that the format in the initial case is Hangul Symbolslength of filename in bytes18 and in the later case it is Hangul Jamolength in bytes36. IOS seamlessly works with the two formats, if I do a localizedcompare on the two names being returned itll return a 1. p  pWhen Im doing the bookkeeping I store the path to the fileincluding its name and the length of this path. Ill do a quick compare on these two attributes when a request comes in and return a handle to the file only if they match. The problem now is when the file is being stored the fcntl call gives me the path in Hangul symbols and when the user requests it back the run time gives me the file path in hangul jamo. As Ive stored the path in Hangul symbols, the appll think its a different file thats somehow not created by the user and returns an invalid file popup.p  pVisually the korean text looks the same in both the encoding schemes, the only difference is in the byte representation. p  p .docx  Hangul Symbols  returned during file creation by FDbr  .docx  Hangul Jamo  returned by the OS in runtime and also if I list the directory contents.p  precode    char fileName1 .docx Hangul Symbols     NSLogfileName3s lengthlu, fileName3, strlenfileName3     char fileName2 .docx Hangul Jamo     NSLogfileName4s lengthlu, fileName4, strlenfileName4 codepre  pIf you run the above code you could see the names are different in their memory footprint. Any idea on howwhy iOS is changing the filename at run time from one scheme to another and also if someone could explain how localizedcompare is returning 1 in both the cases would be great.p
Negative 96 pThe following is a list of mine I am trying to sort out. The problem is that Excel is sorting it based on what I assume is the asce characters, therefore 130 is less than 14. Is there a VBA function to fix this I have attempted to change the formatting to text, numbers, decimals, etc. but nothing seems to work. and it is case sensitive so I cannot input a 0 before the 14, as much as I would like top  pThis is how excel sorts the numbersp  ul li2A130.1 li li2A14 li li2A150.1 li li2A22 li li2A22 li li2A22 li li2A41 li li2A86 li li2A86 li li2C12li ul  pThis is what I am looking forp  ul li2A14li li2A22li li2A22li li2A22li li2A41li li2A86li li2A86li li2A130.1li li2A150.1li li2C12li ul  pEDIT After attempting to use the helper column, this is now what the data looks likep  ul li2C12li li2A14li li2A22li li2A22li li2A22li li2A41li li2A86li li2A86li li2A130.1li ul  pUsing the Helper column that looks like this p  ul li12li li14li li22li li22li li22li li41li li86li li86li li130.1li ul  pusing this formula codeRIGHTB2,LENB2FIND,B2,11codep  pAs you can tell the C comes before A, because now it is sorting it exclusively by the number. The page referenced in the comments helped a great deal, but those had a constant variable they were referring to where as mine can be any alphabetical letter following the numerical.p
Negative 96 pI am new to Android and am trying to display a Google Map on an Android Phone. I created the API Key that should work for any Android App  I did not give any specific SHA for my app. I am guessing that should not matter. Using the Google Android Tutorials, I am doing all the steps, I get the google watermark on the left bottom, but no map. I will post all the code being used. I have tried to use the Google Maps Activity shipped in Android Studio 1.2.1.1. I dont get any errors, but dont get the map either.p  pI am using a MapFragment as it seems to be easier than the MapView.p  pI also viewed the developers console for this API  I dont have any traffic  could it be that the API key is not being used and so my app is not getting the report I suspect that  how can I test thatp  pI am trying to follow the steps here  a hrefhttpsdevelopers.google.commapsdocumentationandroidmap relnofollowhttpsdevelopers.google.commapsdocumentationandroidmapap  pAnother related query is, I am assuming I can create mutiple layouts.

Negative 96 pOne of the interesting aspects of Delphis implementation of anonymous methods closures is the ability to capture the state of variables local to the routine from which the anon method is called.  This is nicely described in one of Marco Cantus books Delphi 2009.p  pMy question is, is there a way to similarly capture the values of variables which are local to the anonymous method itselfp  pTo hopefully illustrate what I mean, consider the following code snippet, which does emnotem do what I meanp  precodetype    TMemoProc  reference to procedureMemo TMemo StepNo  Integer    TForm1  classTForm   [...]   private     procedure ProcessMemo TMemo StepNo Integer   public      Public declarations      MemoProc  TMemoProc     procedure CreateMemoProc   end  procedure TForm1.Button1ClickSender TObject var   i Integer begin   for i  1 to 3 do     MemoProcMemo1, i end  procedure TForm1.FormCreateSender TObject begin   CreateMemoProc   MemoProcMemo1, 0 end  procedure TForm1.ProcessMemo  TMemo StepNo  Integer var   Count  Integer begin   if StepNo  0 then     Count  1   else     IncCount   Memo.Lines.AddSelf.Name    Formatstepno d, count d, [StepNo, Count] end  procedure TForm1.CreateMemoProc begin   MemoProc      procedure Memo  TMemo StepNo  Integer     var       Count  Integer     begin       if StepNo  0 then         Count  1       else         IncCount       Memo.Lines.AddFormatstepno d, count d, [StepNo, Count]     end end codepre  pClick Button1 a few times and its no particular surprise that the numbers inserted change, as youd expect from he fact that Delphi doesnt implicitly initialize simple variables on the stack.p  pBut Im wondering whether someone can think of an ingenious way to capture the anon methods local variables between invocations of it.p  pFwiw, the reason Im wondering about this is that there are usecases where there need to be typically two invocations of the anon method, one to do some initialization and one to do some iteration, and the most concise way of coding would be if the anon methods local variables could somehow be captured.p  pThe sort of usecase I have in mind is writing some general purpose code to iterate a dataset, where it would be handy to specify a boolean function which determines by reference to a rows field values whether a particular dataset row should be processed and another that defines what should be done to the row when the boolean func returns true.p  pIn a tradition implementation, one could specify the fields as DataSet.FieldByNamexxx, but where many fields andor many rows are involved, that can be highly inefficient.p  pSo the agenda behind my q is basically to be able to specify the fields involved in an initialization invocation of the anon method, and then to use them directly as by DataSet11FieldCatflap, rather than DataSet.FieldByNameCatflap.  I have pondered using a containerized list of fields to carry across between the initialization invocation and the itertation one, but it seems unsatisfying to me.p

Negative 96 pThis is a bit of a theory question, but it was bugging me since some time now. p  pstrongBackgroundstrongp  pSuppose you created a nice RESTful service for some highly volatile data. Your users will need to query the RESTful server quite often to get the changes. However, so many requests stress the server quite hard. Also it may make actually not too much sense to query more often then say once per 30 sec. Since the request is parameterised, it would not make much sense to precalculate everthing and serve from the cache. So you need to somehow restrict the user from accessing your resource too often. p  pstrongThe questionstrongp  pHow can you restrict a user by throttling down his requests without breaking the RESTful paradigm of not keeping state in the serverp  pstrongMy current thinkingstrongp  pMy service now creates a helper map that holds a timestamp of the current request together with the access token. The service answers with an http error 429 too many requests if the last access to the RESTful endpoint was less than 30 sec ago. This breaks REST.p  pstrongAlternative ideastrongp  pI could send the access time along encrypted by a private key. The client would then need to send this key along for the next request. My server decrypts it and decides if the client can perform the query yet. This is a lot of overhead it seems...p  pstrongTwiststrongp  pThe situation gets more complicated, since I have different endpoints in my RESTful server for which different access time restrictions should apply. One request basically builds a complete database dump  this is only meant for the customer to get the current state of everything, but it should not be used to query again and again. p  pHow would you try to implement such a requirement in a RESTful server Should I continue with my approach although it clearly introduces a state Anyone has experience with the performance of encrypted state that can be safely passed around without fear for client side manipulationp  pstrongThis is different fromstrongp  pa hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions3105296ifrestapplicationsaresupposedtobestatelesshowdoyoumanagesessionsIf REST applications are supposed to be stateless, how do you manage sessionsa p  pThe above question discusses the general idea of RESTful server APIs and I do understand the concept all right I think. The question here is about a design desicion, not the question if my design breaks REST and why. p  pThe question is how to implement throttling in a so far RESTful server and keep the benefits of high scalability of REST. What are the best practices for that. My question is specific about getting throttling to work. The client cant be trusted to keep the state, so that state transfer in the sense of REST will not work. How do others solve this p

Negative 96 p[This question is targeting SO users with advanced CC expertise only please]p  pRecently, I have been working with many data analysis algorithms that operate on huge real datasets where I load data into arrays and run algorithms that require too many array comparisons and loopings. Especially algorithms in BiClustering. As you may already know publishers of these algorithms traditionally use c for implementation and benchmarking for generating accurate native timings that will be compared to others work.p  pI am currently a researcher and looking for designing an IR framework that use BiClustering behind scenes. I really like C for its features such as dynamic, functional, and oo style. My IR Framework success criteria is speed with disregard for RAM, CPU ... etc p  pMy question is that, When I implement a particular algorithm in c and in C I usually find that c version outperforms way better than C version. I am talking about at least 10 times faster execution in favor to c especially when the test datasets are huge for instance 100KX100K arrays. I read a lot about how .NET works and its compile stages. but still the difference of execution speed between c and c just does not add up. Is that normal  what are advanced steps can be taken to enhance C execution time what I am doing wrong  Lets for argument sake suppose I implement a particular algorithm in both c and c in optimal way.p  pI know this discussion can be broad and wide, thats why I dont give code example. However if you think I should demonstrate my question with an example I will track your comments and answers and modify the question body as needed.p

Negative 96 pI have several thousand entries in a database that were scraped from a website.  They are strings which list conditions which must be met.  For example codeThing1 and Thing2 or Thing3 and Thing4codep  pI would like a user to enter a list of conditions they have, and then check them against the database.  Due to the fact that these strings come from a trusted site, and are so close to valid boolean conditions already Im tempted to put them in an codeevalcode statement.  I could parse the string, find the conditions, check if they are true, and replace them with 1 or 0.  Then replace and, or with ampamp, .  Then I would check to make sure everything at that point is one of space, 1, 0, amp, , , or .  If not, log the error in some way.  If it is just those characters dop  precodeevalBoolean1 ampamp 0  0 ampamp 0 codepre  pI realize codeevalcode is generally a bad idea, so Im open to other ideas.  However, in this case I feel the security is increased if I check for just those characters before running the eval, and since the input is data scraped from a trusted site.p  pIm planning on doing this in javascript, but could also do it in PHP on the server.p

Negative 96 pI have a language translation app that needs to download some initial data on the first run. When the app is first launched, the first step is to get a list of currently supported languages from the server. The user then selects which they wish to install, and the rest of the tables are then downloaded. p  pI check if the languages are present in the local db, and if not, connect to the server and download them as JSON. The user cannot do anything until this data is retrieved from the server.p  pIf there is no network connection, a dialog should prompt the user to go to their WIFI settings. If there is a network error with the download, another dialog would then prompt the user to retry now, or wait until later. If the download succeeds, a new Intent is launched to send them to choose the languages to install.p  pI have this mostly functioning my AlertDialogs arent showing, but the question is whether this is the proper way to accomplish this.

Here the main event is the focusin by a click and the complementary condition here to Bookmark the element is the ctrlkey down. It is a state but which cannot be tested as, the keydown fire events that I dont know how to catch economically. When there are properties to test there is obviously never any problem. With the solution tested the event keydown is not kept. If elmt is replaced by document the event manager in any case sets the event at top and fires immediately on undefined element not already focused.p  pI have not found any text about this subject may be I have not used the right keywords...  p  pemAbout the use of a separate functionemp  pA function is used because, as first example, if the element is focused at pageload by the definition of the hash, it is impossible to fire focusin, then I call the function.p
Negative 96 h2Questionh2  pI want to start the Opera web browser as the process to visit a specific website, then wait until it is closed.p  pA special situation is that the browser may already be open and running, as the user may have visited some website already.p  pIn that case, the browser would probably open a new tab in an existing window, and the newly launched process will be terminated immediately. This should not confuse my waiting process. I either want a new browser window if that can somehow be enforced, maybe via command line arguments and wait until that is closed, or keep the existing browser window and wait until all the tabs resulting from my process are closed.p  h2Environmenth2  pI think it doesnt matter, but my programming environment is codeJavacode and you can assume that I know the path of the browser.p  h2Exampleh2  pThe only browser for which I can obtain the expected behavior is a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions3349922Internet Explorera sigh. Here, I need to basically create a new batch script in a temp folder with something likep  precodestart WAIT  CProgram FilesInternet Exploreriexplore.exe noframemerging httpwww.test.com codepre  pI then run the batch script instead of directly the browser and delete it once I am finished with waiting.p  h2Intended Processh2  pTo make the intended process clearerp  ol liMy program starts.li liMy program launches the Opera browser as separate process and provides an URL to visit as argument to that process.li liThe Opera browser runs asynchronously, as a new process, and visits the provided URL. So far, this is easy.li liAfter launching the new process the Opera browser, my own program should wait for the said process to terminate. This is the hard part, as  ol liMany modern browsers start multiple processes. I would need to wait for all of them.li liMany modern browsers may somehow detach themselves from the process that I launched. Sorry, I dont know a better word, what I mean is I start a process which then starts another process and terminates immediately while the other process keeps running. If I wait for the browser process originally started by my program, the waiting will be finished while the browser is still open.li liA special case of the above is tabbed browsing as realized in many browsers If the browser is already open in a separate process started by the user when I launch it, my newly started browser process may simple communicate the URL to visit to the existing process and terminate. The user is still on my provided URL while my program thinks she has closed the browser. This issue can maybe be forbidden by specifying a special command line argument, like codenoframemergingcode for the IE.li olli liOnce the browser has terminated or all tabs related to the URL I provide have been closed, my program will cease to wait and instead continue doing its business.li ol  pThe use case is that I have a web application which can either run locally or on a server. If it is run locally, it launches a web server, then opens the browser to visit the entry page. Once the browser is closed, that web application should shut down as well. This works reliably for Internet Explorer. For all other cases, the user has to close the browser and then, explicitly, the web application. Thus, if I could wait reliably for Opera to finish, this would make the user experience much better.p  h2Solution Preferencesh2  pSolutions are preferred in the following orderp  ol liAnything which ships with the pure Java JRE. This includes special command line arguments to the browser.li liThings that require me to, e.g., create a batch script such as in the IE case.li liAnything that requires 3rd party open source libraries.li liAnything that requires 3rth party closed source libraries.li ol  pAny programming language independent solution e.g., command line arguments only is preferred over a pure Java one. Any platform independent answer working both Windows and Linux is preferred over platformdependent ones.p  pReason In the ideal case, I would like to know what exactly is done and include it into my own code. As I want to support different browsers see PS below, I would like to avoid having to include one library per browser. Finally, I cannot use commercial or closed source libraries, but if no better answer turns up, of course I will honor any working solution with acceptance. I will accept the first reasonably nice working answer of type 1. If answers of lower preference turn up, I will wait a few days before accepting the best one among them.p  h2PSh2  pI will launch a couple of similar questions for other browsers. Since I believe that browsers are quite different in the command line arguments they digest and the way they launch threads and subprocesses, I think this makes sense. If I would just ask how to start aany browser and wait for its termination, it would be quite hard to determine the right answer. Having, like, one question per wellknown browser could be a nice point of reference too.p  ul liSimilar question regarding Firefox a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions31910823Launch Firefox and Wait until it is Closedali liSimilar question regarding Chrome a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions31911440Launch Chrome and Wait Until it is Closedali liSimilar question regarding Chromium a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions31919123Launch Chromium and Wait Until it is Closedali liSimilar question regarding Edge a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions31921095Launch Edge Browser and Wait Until it is Closedali liSimilar question regarding Safari a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions31928891Launch Safari and Wait Until it is Closedali ul

Negative 96 pI cant understand how the EJB container manage threadsafety for codeStatelesscode beans with instance variables. So I will give a simple example before explaining my concernsp  precodeStateless public class BeanTest  Inject private String var  private Connection connection  Resourcename  jdbcTestDB private DataSource dataSource  public void modify      var  TestName   PostConstruct public void initialize      try          connection  dataSource.getConnection      catch SQLException sqle          sqle.printStackTrace        PreDestroy public void cleanup      try          connection.close         connection  null      catch SQLException sqle          sqle.printStackTrace        codepre  pHere is my questions, assuming that our container supports poolingp  pstrong1. Pooling vs Threadsafestrongp  pUser 1 used an instance of codeBeanTestcode and modified the codevarcode using the modify method, then he finished and the container put the instance of codeBeanTestcode in the managed pool. When User 2 tries to use the same bean for a request, he strongmightstrong get the same instance of codeBeanTestcode intially modified by User 1 I understand that might get another instance too. So which state of the instance variable codevarcode he will find default value which is codenullcode or codeTestNamecode if its the new modified one, do that mean that even codeStatelesscode beans are not 100 threadsafe So finnaly there is no container added value regarding thread safety, as not using instance variable makes a bean thread safe even if its not a codeStatelesscode beanp  pstrong2. Pooling vs PreDestroystrongp  pIf the bean is returned to the managed pool and not destroyed, do that mean that the codePredestroycode method will not be called and in that case the connection will stay opened  So, if we have 30 inctance of that bean in the pool, we may have 30 open connection that is not used, isnt that a performance issue or this not how codePredestroycode is working conbined with pooling using codeConnectioncode is just an example, we may have other kind of ressource that we need to close in codePredestroycodep  pstrongNBstrong emThis is not a real life example, so Iam not looking for an alternative solution, my concern is to understand the whole concept and how things are managed in the Application Server, what is happening under the hoodemp

Negative 96 pI have a source and target table. I was doing a simple merge where I was able to do insert and update operation simultaneously. I just added columns like insert date and update date to know when the record is inserted and updated. Then, I also added a flag columns which tells us that if the record is ever updated if yes then Y else N. I was successful till this but when I tried to use delete it doesnt allow me.I have seen many solutions in sql server but mine is oracle. I was doing a soft delete in which the record is not deleted from the target but just the flag column is updated to Y if some record is deleted from the source table. But I was not able to do that.

There,  he studied under another giant of mathematics, ltstronggtJean  Bernoulliltstronggt. In 1731 Euler became a professor of physics  and mathematics at St. Petersburg Academy of Sciences.  Euler was the most prolific mathematician of all time,  publishing over 800 different books and papers. His  influence was felt in physics and astronomy as well. ltpgt ltarticlegt ltpgt He is perhaps best known for his research into  mathematical analysis. Eulers work,  Introductio in analysin infinitorum 1748,  remained a standard textbook in the field for  well over a century. For the princess of AnhaltDessau he wrote  Lettres a une princesse dAllemagne 17681772,  giving a clear nontechnical outline of the main  physical theories of the time. ltpgt ltpgt One can hardly write a mathematical equation without  copying Euler. Notations still in use today, such  as e and pi, were introduced  in Eulers writings.
