Negative 9921 pIm working on an application that runs on Windows Mobile 6 that needs to be able to retrieve all items from an item table that contain a given string provided by the end user within the items description field. The problem is that there are approximately 170,000 items in the table. Since I need to return all items that contain the string anywhere within the description Im forced to use a LIKE string, which eliminates any chance to use the index. The data and table structure are originally based on a Progress database, which has a wonderful contains operator on any wordindexed fields. This is not the case on our mobile application, since it uses SQL Server Compact 3.5.p  pBasically, my DAL runs the query and retrieves an SqlCeDataReader and then uses an ItemFactory to create a List object that contains only the matched items. This obviously lets us keep our domainbusiness objects separate from the data access layer.p  pFine and dandy, except for the 8m and 42s that it takes to retrieve items when I search for all items that contain something like golf in the description. Obviously this is not an acceptable time frame for the end user.p  pMy first attempt was to instead retrieve all items back from the database using SELECT  FROM Item with an order by clause on one of the main indexed fields. At this point I ran an IndexOf check as I ran through the SqlCeDataReader and had the ItemFactory only add items to the List object if they contained the requested description text. This improved the speed down to 1m 46s. Not too shabby, but still too slow.p  pI then tried another approach that showed promise... almost... While the application starts up, I tried creating a List that contained all item objects within the database takes about 2 minutes to run the query and populate the entire list, but at least its only once as the app is initializing... still... ugh. Once the list is complete, I can easily run queries on that list doing things such as the following I hope my syntax is right... Im not at work right now and I dont have Visual Studio on the pc Im sitting atp  precodeListltItemgt specificItems       AllItems.FindAlli gt i.Description.IndexOfsearchString, StringComparison.OrdinalIgnoreCase gt 0 codepre  pThis approach knocked it down to 21s. Very nice still slow though in the grand scheme of things. However, the problem is that the memory usage is way too great if I load all the items from the database. I had to actually cut off the last 20,000 items so the 21s time frame probably would have been more like 25s during the initial load, because an OutOfMemoryException was being thrown. According to the memory manager on the emulator, I still had about 20 MB of free RAM, but Ive heard that a process can only have 32 MB or RAM associated to it not sure if thats true for WM 6, but it appears so.p  pTo make sure it wasnt because I was using a List object to hold all the items which I was instantiating with the needed capacity in its constructor to avoid dynamic resizing, which Ive also read may cause extra memory usage when it implicity calls EnsureCapacity, I tried using an Item[] array sized ahead of time. This still had the memory issue and the size difference was negligible.p  pOk enough rambling. I know Im likely going to have to some how limit the records returned from the database by the datareader through some indexed search on a different type of field and then will likely use indexOf on that smaller subset of items to get maximum performance thus skipping the Like operator all together. This will cause the end user to have to enter more than just a description search though perhaps item hierarchy information to limit which type of items to search within.p  pAny ideas Am I going about this the wrong wayp  pThanks for listening sorry this post is long, Im kind of thinking out loud.p  pOh I should add just in summary what Im usingp  ul liWindows Mobile 6  li liSql Server Compact Edition 3.5li liC 3.5li ul  pUPDATE While the Bloom Filter approach mentioned below seemed interesting, I could not fulfill one requirement which I didnt really specify above. I cant really match words that are contained inside other words e.g. club would not return clubs. Due to this, I was forced to use a different approach altogether Kent Fredric... thanks for pointing this out. Ive marked Kents answer as the correct one, since his approach was the one that filled the most requirements Mitch, yours had a similar issue as the Bloom filter suggested by Jaunder. However, I have gone a different approach for now... than his way as well.p  pWhat Ive done is pulled all item objects into memory, with only item numbers and descriptions which keeps it under the memory limitations, however it still does cause a longer initialization than I like... multithreading and loading that information behind the scenes while the application is running can take care of that I guess. To perform the searches Ive written my own contains routine. The routine is written in unmanaged c code that uses two pointers and a couple of loops to run through the description and the required matching text. If it finds a match anywhere in the description, it adds the item number to an array. Once all items have been searched, a new query goes back to the database and grabs only the matching item numbers which is very fast due to the index on an integer field. Then those items are created in a List with all information not just the item number and description. The whole operation takes approximately 5  10 seconds depending on the description, which is good enough for now.p  pIll still look into further optimizing this might be able to track how many characters the search term is... if there are less characters remaining on the item description than the required text, the loop could continue straight to the next item.p  pAny suggestions are still welcome. For now I have marked Kents answer as the most correct for my question.p  pProps to Dolch for helping me write the contains routine.p
Negative 9921 pIve written a DLL that may be used in a number of ways referenced by ASP.NET web sites, WinForms, etc..

Negative 9921 pThe title pretty much frames the question. I have not used CHAR in years. Right now, I am reverseengineering a database that has CHAR all over it, for primary keys, codes, etc. How about a CHAR30 columnp  pEdit So the general opinion seems to be that CHAR if perfectly fine for certain things. I, however, think that you can design a database schema that does not have a need for these certain things, thus not requiring fixedlength strings. With the bit, uniqueidentifier, varchar, and text types, it seems that in a wellnormalized schema you get a certain elegance that you dont get when you use encoded string values. Thinking in fixed lenghts, no offense meant, seems to be a relic of the mainframe days I learned RPG II once myself. I believe it is obsolete, and I did not hear a convincing argument from you claiming otherwise. p

Negative 9921 pIn my iPhone application, a user selects an item from a strongUITableViewstrong to choose a resource to view. The strongUIViewControllerstrong subclass required to handle the resource is not known until the resource is retrieved, which may take a few seconds.  p  pIn response to the selection action, I push a loading view controller on the nav stack.  That controller presents a view with a strongUIActivityIndicatorViewstrong along with possibly other status information, and initiates the download of the selected resource. From this view, the user might cancel the download, in which case I would return to the list of resources.

If I push the new typespecific view on the nav stack, the loading view is still in the stack obviously once the loading is complete, theres no need to go back to that view.  Ive tried simply adding the typespecific view as a subview of the loading view, but that doesnt get my typespecific controller onto the nav stack, so it doesnt have a b[self navigationController]b for further navigation.p  pHow can I replace the current view on the nav stack with a new one Or, more generally, how can I show activity  progress when I dont yet know what controller will be used to display the resource being retrieved  p  pIve found pretty cool HUD progress indicator classes, but I dont want the progress indication to appear on top of the list of items being selected from.

Negative 9921 pIm having trouble simulating character keypresses when a nonEnglish input keyboard language is being used in Windows.p  pI tried calling SendInput with KEYEVENTFUNICODEp  precodeKEYBDINPUT ki INPUT input int character  0  ki.wVk  0 ki.wScan  character ki.dwFlags  KEYEVENTFUNICODE ki.time  0 ki.dwExtraInfo  0    input.type  INPUTKEYBOARD input.ki  ki SendInput1, ampinput, sizeofINPUT codepre  pAnd this actually works of course, in my code, I also do a KEYUP after the key down... except in GTK apps there may be other instances where it doesnt work either.p  pAccording to a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibraryms64627128VS.8529.aspx relnofollowMSDNa, iIf KEYEVENTFUNICODE is specified, SendInput sends a WMKEYDOWN or WMKEYUP message to the foreground threads message queue with wParam equal to VKPACKET. Once GetMessage or PeekMessage obtains this message, passing the message to TranslateMessage posts a WMCHAR message with the Unicode character originally specified by wScan. This Unicode character will automatically be converted to the appropriate ANSI value if it is posted to an ANSI window.ip  pSo I believe that when KEYEVENTFUNICODE is passed, the functionality of SendInput is different... not as lowlevel as it usually is.p  pFor the life of me, I cant figure out any other way to get SendInput to print out characters properly for the users keyboard language. For example, if the keyboard input language is Swedish, I cant get it to output  instead, it prints out a quotation mark, and I cant get it to output nonASCII characters properly, either accented letters, etc.p  pThanks in advance.p

Negative 9921 papologies for the Wall Of Text...  p  h3Summaryh3  pUsing Dependency Injection with my Winfor application is creating a large number of Repository Contexts. Im not sure if the way im using this is right or wrong, or what the common practice is. p  h3Detailsh3  pIn the last 6 odd months, Ive been making ASP.NET MVC applications that impliment the Unit O fWork pattern with the Repository Pattern. On top of this, Ive been using an Dependency Injection on all of these web applications with some success.p  pSo this is an example of me wiring up my repository. p  precodepublic EntityFrameworkRepositoryRegistry        ForltIUnitOfWorkgt              .HybridHttpOrThreadLocalScoped  Lifecycle of the object.             .UseltSqlServerContextgt   My EF Context.             .CtorltstringgtconnectionString.IsnameSqlServerEF             .CtorltstringgtdefaultContainerName.IsEntities        Ayendes EFProf application       EntityFrameworkProfiler.Initialize            Scanx gt                        x.TheCallingAssembly               x.ExcludeNamespaceContainingTypeltFake.FakeContextgt               x.WithDefaultConventions                       codepre  pOk  works great.  Main thing to note here is that p  ul liIm assuming the Lifecycle is the correct one for a Web scenario. li liThe context  will only exists once, per REQUEST that hits the  webserver. li ul  pkewl. p  pNow, for my WinForm application, i initially created a single  Unit Of Work object no dependency injection, just yet and kept passing that baby around to  all the services and then to the repositories. p  pFor this win application, it hits the DB to find out all the text  files it needs to parse. eg. 25 files. Then, for each file, it  creates a new Parser, reads each line and chucks the parsed data into  a db table. Fine. p  pProblem was, this concext was being shared amoungst ALL Parsers, which  was seriously throwing up errors all over the shop. p  pSo then i added some Dependency Injection and uses that registry code above. Sorta same thing  lots of serious errors. This is because ONE context was again created for the single thread  the winform.p  pSo, i now tweaked the Registry of the Context to following p  precodepublic EntityFrameworkRepositoryRegistrybool isForTheWeb        if isForTheWeb                ForltIUnitOfWorkgt              .HybridHttpOrThreadLocalScoped              .UseltSqlServerContextgt              .CtorltstringgtconnectionString.IsnameSqlServerEF              .CtorltstringgtdefaultContainerName.IsEntities            else                ForltIUnitOfWorkgt              .UseltSqlServerContextgt              .CtorltstringgtconnectionString.IsnameSqlServerEF              .CtorltstringgtdefaultContainerName.IsEntities             EntityFrameworkProfiler.Initialize       Scanx gt                x.TheCallingAssembly           x.ExcludeNamespaceContainingTypeltFake.FakeContextgt          x.WithDefaultConventions          codepre  pSo for a WinForm application, it now doesnt set the Lifecycle. This  then created around 160 or so contexts i think But it didnt really  error, either. p  pSo, im not sure if this is the right way to do things. p  pSo my app, in effect, has 25 different timers going, to check a file  every .. say .. 10 secs. If theres new data, it parsers it.  Otherwise, come back in 10 secs. p  pShould each one of these files that gets parsed, be its own thread  and then create a context per thread which i feel is similar to the  web scenario. Or is this fine I know its a lot of contexts, but  each context doesnt mean a live connection to the db .. and with  connection pooling, this shouldnt really be a problem. p  pThe reason it has so many contexts, is becuase of the following  code... and these are seperate Constructors for some of the  Repository classes... p  precodepublic SqlServerContextstring, string  public GameFileRepository IUnitOfWork  public LogEntryRepositoryIUnitOfWork  public AlertRepositoryIUnitOfWork  ... etc..  codepre  pand for the main Service... p  precodepublic PunkBusterParserIUnitOfWork, IGameFileRepositry,  ILogEntryRepository, ILoggingService  codepre  pso the service requires an UoW and each repository also requires  one ..which means a new one is getting created for each one. p  pIm sure i havent structured this correctly... p  pAny suggestions would be sincerely grateful p

Negative 9921 pI have an ASP form that needs to submit data to two different systems. First the data needs to go into an MS SQL database, which will get an ID. I then need to submit all that form data to an external system, along with that ID. p  pPretty much everything in the code works just fine, the data goes into the database, and the data will go to the external system. The problem is I am not getting my ID back from SQL when I execute that query. I am under the impression this is happening because of how fast everything occurs in the code. The database is adding its row at the same time my post page runs its query to get the ID back, I think. p  pI need to know of a way to wait until SQL finished the insert or wait for a specific amount of time maybe. I already tried using the hacks to sleep with ASP, that did not help. p  pI am sure I could accomplish this in .Net, my background is more .Net than ASP, but this is what I have to work with on my current project. p  pAny ideasp  pEDIT Code from the the function writing to the DB.p  pdriis  That was my understanding of how this should be working, but my follow up query for the ID returns nothing, so my though is that the row hasnt finished being inserted or updated yet.

Negative 9921 pstrongIs there anyway to load an objective c script at runtime, and run it against the classesmethodsobjectsfunctions in the current iPhone appstrong p  pemstrongMAJOR NOTEstrong The major reason Id like to do this is to allow me to rapidly prototype an application, and then, after Im done a major prototyping phase, take the scripts I was writing and compile them at build time instead. I dont ever plan on shipping an app with an objective c interpreter in it.emp  pThe reason i ask is that Ive been playing around with a hrefhttpgithub.comprobablycoreywaxiPhone waxa, a lua interpreter that can be embedded in an iPhone app, and it works very nicely, in the sense that any objectmethodfunction thats publically available in your Objective C code is automatically bridged, and available in lua.p  pThis allows you to rapidly prototype applications by simply making the core of your app be lua files that are in the users documents directory. Just reload the app, and you can test out changes to your lua files without needing to rebuild the app in XCode  a big time saverp  pBut, with Apples recent 3.1.3 SDK stuff, it got me thinking that the safest approach for doing this type of rapid prototypeing would be if you could use Objective C as the interpreted code... That way, worst case scenario, you could just compile it into your app before your release instead.  I have heard that the lua source can be compiled to byte code, and linked in at build time, but I think the ultimate safe thing would be if the scripted source was in objective c, not lua. That way your source is always in objective c, regardless.p  pThis leads me to wondering ive searched, but come up with nothing if there are any examples on how to embed an Objective C Interpreter in an iPhone app This would allow you to rapidly prototype your app against the current classes that are built into your binary, and, when your about to deploy your app, instead of running the classes through the in app interpreter, you compile them in instead.p  pWith the iPad and OS 4, bluetooth and virtual keyboards can work with iPhones and iPads... Thats going to make this type of rapid prototyping something much more useful, at least for dev time. If you have an interpreter built into your app and have it on your iPad, for example, you can code against the interpreter while on the road, without XCode. And to me, the most useful way to get the source back to an apple approved state would be if the scripts were Objective C.p

Negative 9921 pwe have a ASP.NET site with a SQL2008 DB.p  pIm trying to implement transactions in our current system. p  pWe have a method that is inserting a new row to a table TableA, and it works fine with transaction. If an exception is throwed, it will do the rollback.p  pMy problem is, that another user cant do anything that invole with TableA in the same time  probably because its locked.p  pI can understand why the transaction have to lock the new row, but I dont want it to lock the whole table  forcing userB to wait for userA to finish.p  pI have tryed to set isolationlevel ReadUncommitted and Serializable on the transaction, but it didnt work.p  pSo im wondering if I also need to rewrite all my select methods, so they are able to select all the rows except the new row there is in the makingp  pExamplep  ul liTable T has 10 rowsrecordsli liUser A is inserting a new row into table T.

Negative 9921 pI would like to pass a type that is generated at runtime via TypeBuilder to a generic method in a generic class. I cant pass it as object as reflection is used to look up various properties.p  pAs I understand, this cant be done as generics are applied at compiletime rather than runtime.p  pI know I can change an method likep  precodepublic T Read       T data  new T      ...      return data  codepre  pto be something like p  precodepublic object ReadType newType       object data   Activator.CreateInstancenewType        ...      return data  codepre  pbut this obviously loses all the advantages of generics when the type is known, so I will probably end with both methods, which unfortunately means also duplicating quite a few other other helper functions.p  pIs there any better way of resolving this issuep  pThis particular project needs to work under the 3.5 framework, but if it isnt possible in 3.5, but is under 4.0, I wouldnt mind knowing.p
Negative 9921 pIve used a very interesting article which i recommend, you can see it here  a hrefhttpadamyan.blogspot.com relnofollowhttpadamyan.blogspot.coma, and ive started to localize my asp net mvc2 site.br However, ive come to a point where i dont know if it would be possible to do something else, or if i just have to do it this way brbr The thing is, most of the pages are text and links and stuff. In general, all of the links i have them using some markup and calling the Html.ActionLink for example. So, if im translating a page that has 20 links, i would have to split all of those texts into 20 entries in the resx file and the Html.ActionLink text would have to have its own resx entry, of course. I find this a little bit unpractical. Is there a way to just copy the whole contents, and make some intermediary parse the tags in the resx file and call the appropriate code brbr Thanksp

Negative 9921 pI just got a TooManyRowsAffectedException while working with NHibernate and Ive seen workarounds for that by injecting a different batcher like here a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions1354362toomanyrowsaffectedexceptionwithencryptedtriggers26982052698205TooManyRowsAffectedException with encrypted triggersa, or by modifying the triggers in the database to use SET NOCOUNT ON I cant use this one since I dont want to modify the database  it is very complex with more than a hundred tables all related together and I dont want to go mess with it since other applications use it. What I dont understand is why this exception happens. All I do is that I have a Sample object thats got a couple of values that I check, and if the values fit with given criteria, I set the Sample.IsDone row to Y in our database all booleans are represented by a char Y or N. The code is very simplep  precodeIQueryableltSamplegt samples  session.QueryltSamplegt.Wheres gt s.Value  desiredValue foreach Sample sample in samples    sample.IsDone  Y   session.Flush  Throws TooManyRowsAffectedException  session.Flush  Throws TooManyRowsAffectedException codepre  pThe Flush call throws whether I put it inside the loop or outside. Is there something I am doing wrong or is it only related with the way the database is made I tried calling SaveOrUpdate on the sample before Flush, but it didnt change anything. I know I can work around this exception, but Id prefer understanding the source of the problem.p  pNote In the exception it tells me the actual row count is 2 and the expected is 1. Why does it update 2 rows since I only change 1 rowp  pThanks all for your helpp  pEDITp  pI was able to find out that the cause of that is because there is a trigger in the database updating a row in the Container table Containers contain Samples when the sample is updated. Is there a way to configure NHibernate so that it knows about this trigger and expects the right number of rows to get updatedp
Negative 9921 pI have a COM server CSTA MFC based app and a COM client CMTA. The COM server must live in an STA, since its an MFC app I have no choice in this matter. The client issues a call to the server, and the server issues a callback to the client. Thats where the error happens codeRPCECANTCALLOUTININPUTSYNCCALLcode. Im guessing if the server had been an MTA, this problem would never have arised, but sadly, the documentation for MFC explicitly denies initializing the apartment as an MTA.p  pAny ideas on how to work around this problemp  pI have been toying with the idea of letting the server object the object I expose through the running object table live in an apartment of its own MTA. Would this be a good idea, or is there something simpler to try firstp  pstrongUPDATEstrong p  pThe server object is just a thin interface point to certain functions within the application. Most of the time it just reads and writes to memory locations, but there are instances where it generates window messages to various windows within the application.

Negative 9921 pIm trying to get the correct address information passed back via IPN. Im passing all the address variables through to PayPal including address2 and using addressoverride1 to ensure this address is used. This works fine. Address1 and address2 are obviously passed back concatenated within addressstreet and i want to separate these out again but they seem to just be separated by a space which i obviously cant use to split it as there are probably multiple spaces. Ive read other posts saying that 0D0A or r are used to split them up but that doesnt seem to be true for me ive tried splitting with them and when i use teststreet  issetPOST[addressstreet]  POST[addressstreet]   at the top of my ipn script and save teststreet in a db it just comes back with a space in between.p  pIt seems ridiculously difficult to find out how these are joined and how to separate them, surely this can be an unusual thing to want Obviously the workaround is to not use the address2 variable at all and just add its contents to the end of the address1 variable with a comma inbetween but this means that its not over 2 lines and i dont have access to them as separate variables which is quite annoying.p  pIf anyone has any pointers as to how i can overcome this then it would be much appreciated as I cant work it outp  pThanks so much,p  pDavep

But with Safari the name of the file ends up being File.xls.xml.p  pThe server is running Apache on Mac OS X.

The code is belowp  precode public static T QueryltTgtthis SqlConnection conn, string query where T  new              T obj  defaultT          using SqlCommand command  new SqlCommandquery, conn                      using SqlDataReader reader  command.ExecuteReader                              while reader.Read                                      obj  new T                      PropertyInfo[] propertyInfos                     propertyInfos  typeofT.GetProperties                      for int i  0 i lt reader.FieldCount i                                              var name  reader.GetNamei                          foreach var item in propertyInfos                                                      if item.Name.Equalsname, StringComparison.InvariantCultureIgnoreCase ampamp item.CanWrite                                                              item.SetValueobj, reader[i], null                                                                                                                             return obj      codepre  hr  precode  public class User              public int id  get set          public string firstname  get set          public string lastname  get set          public DateTime signupDate  get set          public int age  get set          public string gender  get set            var user  conn.QueryltUsergtselect id,firstname,lastname from users       codepre  pI just wanted a second opinion on my approach above of using reflection to tie the values together, if theres anything i can do better in the code above. Or if theres some other totally different approach i can take to get the same resultp  pI think i can probably improve the code in the helper method by removing the loop for propertyInfos and using a dictionary instead. Is there anything else that needs to be  tweakedp  pP.S im aware of Dapper, i just wanted to implement something similar on my own to help me learn better.p

Negative 9921 pI am in the process of automating a ClickOnce deployment of a product. I am using ANT for a build script and I am running into a problem that I cannot find an answer to. I can build my project and copy the needed files EXEs, DLLs, etc. to a staging directory. I can open the command prompt and manually run mage.exe and generate and sign both the application and deployment manifest. This gives me a working deployment that will install and run. The problem comes when I try to automate this with an ANT script. I compile the product and copy it just fine. When it comes to creating the application manifest I get the following error for every filep  pWarning MSB3178 Assembly assemblyName is incorrectly specified as a file.p  pKeep in mind that the exact same mage command is used, but when I run it from a script I get this warning, which is really an error in the end. Because of this error that application manifest file is invalid and my product wont install on a users machine. Once again, if I manually type the same command in the command prompt then it works and my deployment is great, but from my script it is not working. All of the properties are verified to be correct and all paths are also correct. I have also tried to run the commands with all hardcoded values no properties and the errors persist.p  pAny help would be appreciated.p  precodelttarget namefoogt   ltexec executablemagegt     ltarg lineNew Application                Processor x86                ToFile DBuildSynchClickOnceTabletMPE1.0.0.0TabletMPE.exe.manifest                name TabletMPE               Version 1.0.0.0                FromDirectory 1.0.0.0gt ltexecgt lttargetgt codepre

In this case, the above query will not find the record we need Sat, 1700, 0200, because we probably dont have any opentime less than 0200 120. To solve this, we convert Sun, 0100 to Sat, 2500, by adding 71440 a whole week to the currenttime, which will result 10140. Then DB query like this        p  precodeSELECT opentime,clostime FROM openhours      WHERE opentime lt currenttime           AND closetime gt currenttime          OR opentime lt currenttime 10080          AND closetime gt currenttime  10080 codepre  pOr what is alternative and neater solutionp

Negative 9921 pIve just starting using Autofac DI for the first time on a large production project.  I currently have it do registration and resolving for normal situations in Asp.Net MVC3.  By this, I mean controllers, business layer, repositories, etc.p  pMy problem is that I have 50 classes that all have the same interface. I could give each class a unique interface type, but the problems with that approach arep  ol liIt is extremely tedious as the methods are all exactly the same across all classes li liThis seems to violate all the DRY principles of coding.li ol  pThe usage is as a reference to the class to be instantiated on a MVC3 Custom attribute in our view models.  Usage isp  precode[CustomAttributetypeoffoo] Public string FooProperty getset codepre  pThis attribute is then used in a custom MVC3 HTML Helper method and gets the fully qualified type name or can be a System.Type to use from  the code[CustomAttributetypeoffoo]code  attribute. From the name of the class to instantiate, the Html.Helper method requests the class to be instantiated.  Before we added DI to the application, we had this working by using System.Activator.CreateInstance.p  pThis approach was taken because it solves problems in other parts of the application where the attribute information is reused.p  pWhen Ive looked at a number of ways to do this and am seriously confused as to the correct approach to take.  Some guidance would be appreciated.p

Negative 9921 pIm having somewhat of an odd issue with trying to piece together a somewhat dynamic Google Maps display. I have overlays on a map that I would like to call a function when clicked. Initially I had everything hard coded, so I had a function for each overlay like thisp  precodegoogle.maps.event.addListenersouthEast, click, showSouth function showSouth      do stuff  codepre  pThis worked without a problem, but then I made the whole page more dynamic so I decided to make one function that would pass an ID and then display based on that, which is how I feel it should have been set up originally anyway. I altered the code to look more like thisp  precodegoogle.maps.event.addListenersouthEast, click, showArea1 function showAreaid      do stuff based on that id  codepre  pThe function worked, but the problem is it gets called immediately on page load. After researching Ive learned that when you call a function with the parentheses, that function gets called immediately and then its return value is referenced. a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions3246928injavascriptdoesitmakeadifferenceificallafunctionwithparenthesessourceap  pSo now Im a little stuck as to how exactly to go about passing that ID to the function without having it call the function immediately.

A codestruct  code simply takes an empty value, easy enough to optimize away.  In fact, the strange part is that they produce different code without the codeO3code. p  pYou cannot however pull this same trick with simply codetypedef void moocode because void cannot assume any value, not even an empty one.

At this point chef runs and installs the software as per the runlist.  All of the expected attributes exist, particularly node[ec2][blockdevicemappingebs1] which is the block device on devsdc.p  pI am now working on something with the FOG gem and on the whole I have been able to recreate the above situation.

This leaves me guessing that there is something need to change in my code but I unable to figure out.   p  pInvestigation  p  pWe have implemented the codeCFSTRFILEDESCRIPTORcode, codeCFSTRFILECONTENTScode and codeCFTXTcode in the codeCDataObjectGetdatacode method.  I have noticed is that in case of Outlook 2007, when I drop file from my application to message body in new message, only codeCFSTRFILEDESCRIPTORcode clipboard format is called.  While in case of Outlook 2003, if I drop file from my application to message body in new message  codeCDataObjectGetDatacode is called two times, codeCFSTRFILEDESCRIPTORcode followed by codeCFSTRFILECONTENTScode clipboard formats.   p  pIn the second  file contents are extracted since GetData is not called second time hence file is not attached to email. Following is the sample code. p  pDoes anyone know what could be the reason Or what else i can try to narrow down the issue. p  precodeSTDMETHODIMP CDataObjectGetData               LPFORMATETC                pFE,              LPSTGMEDIUM         pSTM     HGLOBAL                                        hMem  LPFILEGROUPDESCRIPTOR        pfgd  UINT                                        uFormat, uBytes      void                                        p       muFmtUsed  0      uFormat  pFEgtcfFormat        FILEDESCRIPTOR format      if uFormat  mfe[0].cfFormat                    if pFEgtdwAspect amp DVASPECTCONTENT                      return DVEDVASPECT      if pFEgttymed amp TYMEDHGLOBAL                      return DVEFORMATETC           hMemGlobalAlloc GMEMSHARE  GMEMMOVEABLE,                              sizeofFILEGROUPDESCRIPTOR               if hMem  NULL                      return STGEMEDIUMFULL               pfgd  LPFILEGROUPDESCRIPTORGlobalLock hMem              pfgdgtcItems  1              pfgdgtfgd[0].dwFlags  FDATTRIBUTES              pfgdgtfgd[0].dwFileAttributes  FILEATTRIBUTENORMAL              lstrcpy pfgdgtfgd[0].cFileName, mpszName               GlobalUnlock hMem               pSTMgthGlobal  hMem              pSTMgttymed  TYMEDHGLOBAL              pSTMgtpUnkForRelease  NULL              muFmtUsed  uFormat              return SOK              FILECONTENTS clipboard format      else if uFormat  mfe[1].cfFormat                    if pFEgtdwAspect amp DVASPECTCONTENT                      return DVEDVASPECT      if pFEgttymed amp TYMEDHGLOBAL                      return DVEFORMATETC               if mpData                                    mpData  PKDropGetData                                       mpStruct, FALSE, FALSE, ampuBytes                         hMem  GlobalAlloc GMEMSHAREGMEMMOVEABLE, uBytes               if hMem  NULL                      return STGEMEDIUMFULL               p  GlobalLock hMem              memcpy p, mpData, uBytes              GlobalUnlock hMem               pSTMgthGlobal  hMem              pSTMgttymed  TYMEDHGLOBAL              pSTMgtpUnkForRelease  NULL              muFmtUsed  uFormat              return SOK         ....  .....  ....      return DVEFORMATETC      QueryGetDataLPFORMATETC pFE   UINT uFormat  pFEgtcfFormat BOOL bRet  FALSE if uFormat  mfe[0].cfFormat             filegroupdescriptor  bRet  BOOLpFEgttymed amp TYMEDHGLOBAL   else if uFormat  mfe[1].cfFormat        filecontents      bRet  BOOLpFEgttymed amp TYMEDHGLOBAL  else  bRet  false       return bRet  SOK  DVEFORMATETC   codepre

Negative 9921 pI have a 32 bit application that depends on the Visual Studio 2010 C Runtime Redistributable.p  pHowever in one part of my application I need to do dll injection.

I do not know if this affects the outcome, but I have extended the TreeView to my own class so I can add a few properties and methods to it.p  precodepublic class MyTreeView  TreeView   public void BuildTree      this.Nodes.Clear     foreach TestSetFolder folder in Folders               MyTreeNode node  new MyTreeNode          node.Name  folder.Name          node.Text  folder.Name          node.Tag  folder          node.FolderID  folder.NodeID          node.IsPopulated  false           this.Nodes.Addnode           codepre  pThis is how I am adding the nodes to the list.

Negative 9921 pFor my nonapp store app, Ive been using the private framework Core Surface to draw directly to the screen of the iPhone. However, this can be rather slow on older devices because it heavily uses the CPU to do its drawing. To fix this, Ive decided to try to use OpenGLES to render the pixels to the screen.p  pCurrently and I have no way of changing this, I have a reference to an unsigned short  variable called BaseAddress, and essential 3rd party code accesses BaseAddress and updates it with the new pixel data. p  pIve set up a GLKViewController, and implemented the viewDidLoad as followsp  precode voidviewDidLoad      [super viewDidLoad]      self.context  [[EAGLContext alloc] initWithAPIkEAGLRenderingAPIOpenGLES2]      if self.context          NSLogFailed to create ES context           [EAGLContext setCurrentContextself.context]      GLKView view  GLKView self.view     view.context  self.context      glGenBuffers1, ampscreenBuffer     glBindBufferGLARRAYBUFFER, screenBuffer     glBufferDataGLARRAYBUFFER, sizeofBaseAddress, BaseAddress, GLDYNAMICDRAW   codepre  pwhere screenBuffer is an instance variable.

Negative 9921 pI am currently planning my final year project were I wish to create a application which supports voice over IP and text based chat though not the next skype. I just really want a easy to use lightweight way to get the voIP part done with and it does not need extended amount of features, at least not to begin with.p  pOne of the features I wanted is that it doesnt go by a server, but that is because I do not want to maintain a server after the release of the application. So if it is possible to just give your IP to someone and they join using it would be preferable. p  pIm planning to use the Qt framework for GUI, though it can be changed and so can the language C, so nothing is written in stone. The software will run on windows.p  pI have looked at H.323, sip and some other open source, but it seems just so difficult to get into and I cannot figure out whether they do what I need them to do.p  pAny open source libraries I should look into that does partly the thing I want Any sources I have missed Im completely new to the voIP world and could use a push in the right direction. Again if there is a language that does this in a simple fashion I can just switch since I am currently in a planning phase. Thanks for any help I get.  p

Negative 9921 pOur website has developed a need for realtime updates, and we are considering various cometlongpolling solutions.  After researching, we have settled on nginx as a reverse proxy to 4 tornado instances hosted on Amazon EC2.  We are currently using the traditional LAMP stack and have written a substantial amount of code in PHP.  We are willing to convert our PHP code to Python to better support this solution.  Here are my questionsp  ol lipAssuming a quadcore processor, is it ok for nginx to be running on the same server as the 4 tornado instances, or is it recommended to run two separate servers one for nginx and one for the 4 tornado processespli lipIs there a benefit to using HAProxy in front of Nginx  Doesnt Nginx handle loadbalancing very well by itselfpli lipFrom my research, Nginx doesnt appear to have a great URL redirecting module.  Is it preferred to use Redis for redirects  If so, should Redis be in front of Nginx, or behindpli lipA large portion of our application code will not be involved in realtime updates.  This code contains several database queries and filesystem reads, so it clearly isnt suitable for a nonblocking app server.  From my research, Ive read that the blocking issue is mitigated simply by having multiple Tornado instances, while others suggest using a separate app server ex. GunicornDjangoFlask for blocking calls.  What is the best way to handle blocking calls when using a nonblocking server pli lipConverting our code from PHP to Python will be a lengthy process.  Is it acceptable to simultaneously run ApachePHP and Tornado behind Nginx, or should we just stick to on language either tornado with gunicorndjangoflask or tornado by itselfpli ol

I can clean the old select and start a new one but it is strange. I dont know if my strategy is good enought.p

Negative 9921 pI often use the classfactory pattern whereby a class has a private constructor and a static method to create the class. This allows for the situation where the class cannot be constructed for some reason, and a null is returned  very handy.p  pI would like to be able to extend this to a factory method which creates a particular class from a hierarchy of derived classes depending on conditions. However I cant see a way of then hiding the constructors of the derived classes to force the use of the factory method. If the factory method is in the base class it no longer has access to the private constructors of derived classes. Putting a factory method in every derived class doesnt work as the required type must then be known beforehand. Nested classes might be a way if a class had access to the private members of a nested class, but sadly it seems that the nested classes have access to the private members of the enclosing class, but not the other way round.p  pDoes anyone know of a way of doing thisp

Negative 9921 pIn my game there is a render module that handles shaders, framebuffers and drawing. Now I want to encapsulate the logic of these three tasks separately. The idea is that I split up the render module in three modules. I do this for decreasing code complexity and easily implementing live shader reload, but isnt important for my question.p  pThe drawing module would create empty shader objects with codeglCreateProgramcode and globally store them along with the path to the source file. The shader module would check for them and create the actual shader by loading the source file, compiling and linking.p  pBut in this concept, it could occur a case where the render module already wants to draw but the shader module hadnt create the actual shader. So my question is, is it valid to draw with an empty shader program It is completely acceptable for me that the screen would be black when this happens. Creating the shaders should be ready very soon, so the delay might be unnoticeable.p  pIs it valid to draw with an empty shader program How can I implement the idea of elsewhere loaded shaders otherwisep

Negative 9921 pI am developing an Android application which logs sensor data and summarizes it, the output being JSON data.

The number of threads for each block is 1024 maximum number and so 1 block at a time for each SM.

Negative 9921 pI am debugging an ios application that i dont have the source code for and its a stripped binary, so there are no symbols that i can use. I therefore use addresses to set bps with the help of IDA and classdump. I have come into situations where i cannot really understand the return value or parameter of a specific method. I know that the parameters are supposed to be on r2 registers and on and that the return value of methods is on r0.p  pLets take the subDataWithRange method which returns an NSData pointer. Of course, I cannot do po pointeraddr because i have no symbols and thus gdb fails. So, I am trying to examine the contents on my own. Though i am pretty sure on the bytes i should be getting back, i do retrieve a pointer, but when i do something like x20x r0 to examine its contents, i do not see meaningful bytes.p  pTherefore I would like to ask about the structure of an NSData object and other ios objects like NSString as they would appear in raw bytes in memory.

Negative 9921 pUsing EF5 Fluent API does anyone know if its possible to have a binary column in the database but a long in the C When we put a long in the entity we always end up with EF errors at runtime unable to perform the mapping. If we put a byte[] then everything works binary in db usually means byte[] type in .NET code. We cant change database column type so its not a solution.p  pstrongHere is what we end up doing strongp  precodefrom l in LeadDataRepository.GetAll select new   we need an anonymous type here we use Linq to Entities     FirstName  l.FirstName,     LastName  l.LastName,     CompanyName  l.CompanyName,     CityId  l.CityId,     DbID  l.DbId  .ToList  once listed we use Linq to objects .Selectl gt new LeadListingViewModel   our real class     FirstName  l.FirstName,     LastName  l.LastName,     CompanyName  l.CompanyName,     CityId  l.CityId.ToLong,  here we use our extension method on byte[] which converts to long     DbID  l.DbId.ToLong  codepre  pIf we were able to specify in the entity that CityId is a long and not a byte[] and the same for DbId then we wouldnt have to do all this redondant code. Therefore this is not possible, EF complains at runtime because the db column type is binary. But SQL Server handles implicit conversions from binary to bigint...p

Negative 9921 pI am conducting a beta  regression in R, using the package betareg version 3.03. For a Monte Carlo simulation, I would like to model the dispersion  parameter phi as a logit model. Unfortunately, the package does not support the link function logit for phi. I have seen that it is possible to supply a self written glm  link object, but I do not know how to do this. Does anyone know, how I could solve my problem and model phi as a logistic model.p  precodebetaregformula, data, subset, na.action, weights, offset,         link  clogit, probit,cloglog, cauchit, log, loglog,         link.phi  NULL, type  cML, BC, BR,         control  betareg.control..., model  TRUE,y  TRUE, x  FALSE, ... codepre  plink.phibr character specification of the link function in the precision model phi. strongCurrently, identity, log, sqrt are supported.strong The default is log unless formula is of type y  x where the default is identity for backward compatibility. Alternatively, an object of class linkglm can be supplied.p  hr
Negative 9921 pIm having a little trouble with escaping in Applescript and shell scripts. Basically, a URL will be set as variableUrl, and this will be fed into a shell scriptp  precodedo shell script cd dir cat file  grep v http  sed s amp variableUrl amp  gt urlsxy.txt codepre  pThis isnt working mdash I get nothing in my output file. The issue, I think, is that there are unescaped characters. Worse, I cant know ahead of time how the URL will look, and thus I cant set up any way to put backslashes in as escapes. When, instead of using codevariableUrlcode, I just insert dummy text, I have no problem. This, for example, works finep  precodedo shell script cd dir cat file  grep v http  sed sdummytext gt urlsxy.txt codepre  pJust now, I have also tried turning the url into a bash variable and doing ... p  precodesed sBASHVARg codepre  pbut this fails as well, for presumably the same reason. Can any body tell me if there is a workaround for this problem, or if there is a way of escaping an entire variable without knowing in advance what its content will bep  pIm very new at this, and as you can see am only familiar with the basics.p
Negative 9921 pI have a simply question and hopefully someone can answer this. I need to get an animated model into three.js from Maya. I know currently the only exporter converter to the three.js JSON format that supports animations is the blender plugin. Unfortunately, my company works with Maya and Blender doesnt take FBXs. I already figured out that in order to do what I need to do, I need to export out of maya a Collada, import the Collada into Blender, then export out to three.js using the plugin.p  pBut here is my problem. When importing the dae file from maya, I get an errorp  blockquote   pSax FWL Error Could not resolve sid emem referenced in skin controller.p blockquote  pfor each bone in the rig and nothing is connected properly. I also tried exporting the fbx from other Autodesk applications but each one gives me the same errors.p  pAnyone know either how to resolve this error or another way to get a Maya animated rig into blender without error.p

However, the underlying data emcouldem be nested arbitrarily deep, which would require arbitrary routing. br I think the ideal for this would be a route that says all the rest of the path goes to any array of parameters, but it doesnt look like there is a way to do anything like that in AngularJS. Just for the sake of completeness, does anyone know of a way to do thisp

Negative 9921 pFirst of all I hope its not a problem I started a new topic. Tbh I dont have a clue how to ask a question based on an already answered one, so I made this.p  pIm pretty new with Java and my problem is the following. Im writing a little chat program and Im using a codeJEditorPanecode with an codeHTMLEditorKitcode to display text in different colors, to display smileys, and display hyperlinks.p  pMy problem is, and after some research I found out the problem might be due to Java7, I cant get the linewrap working properly. I want the text to word wrap and to wrap in the middle of Strings exceeding the width of the component. The word wrap works fine, but if someone types in a pretty long string the codeJEditorPanecode gets expanded and you need to resize the frame to get everything on screen, which is what I do not want to happen.p  pIve tried a few fixes for this problem, but they only allow letter wrap such that word wrap no longer works. Beside that, I want the user to be able to wrap his text by hitting Enter. For that Im adding n to the text and with the fixes this will no longer affect the result and everythings going to be displayed in one line.p  pIm feeling like Ive spent years in the web to find a solution but unitl now nothing worked for my case, especially since it appeared to be the same fix all the time. I hope you guys can help me.p  pemThis means in summaryemp  pstrongWhat I havestrongp  ul liLine wraps word in case of long strings separated by spacesli liif you use Windows and your input contains line wraps created by hitting enter, they will also wrapli liIf you type in a very long string without spaces, the panel gets expanded and you need to resize the frameli liHTML formatting allows me to display different colors as well as hyperlinks and emoticonsli ul  pstrongWhat I needstrongp  ul liWord wrap behaviour like it is at the moment in case it is possible but letter wrap ONLY in case of long strings not separated by spaces to prevent the panel from expanding.li liManually added line wraps made by hitting ENTER in the input area or if I copy an pre formatted text into the input panelli liHTML formatting like I have alreadyli ul  pstrongWhat Ive tried and what didnt helpstrongp  pa hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions6329967jtextpanedoesntwraptextjtextpane doesn39t wrap texta and a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions14217911jtextpaneisnotwrappingtextJTextPane is not wrapping textap  pHere is some code to try it yourself.

Ive tried to combine the fix for an HTMLEditorKit with an StlyedEditorKit Fix. But I have to be honest, I dont have any clue what I actually did there  The sad thing is, the manual line wraping does no longer work with this as a replacement of the HTMLEditorKit. Maybe you can use this as a base for some better implementation.p  pTo use it in my example just create a new class in the project with the CustomEditorKit and replace the HTMLEditorKit in the example with this CustomEditorKit. You will notice that word and letter wrapping works now, but if you hit ENTER to get your own line wrap this change will no longer appear in the outputpanel and everything will be displayed in one line. Another strange problem of it is, that if you resize the frame the lines will sometimes lay on each other.p  precodeimport javax.swing.SizeRequirements import javax.swing.text.Element import javax.swing.text.View import javax.swing.text.ViewFactory import javax.swing.text.html.HTMLEditorKit import javax.swing.text.html.InlineView import javax.swing.text.html.ParagraphView  SuppressWarningsserial public class CustomEditorKit extends HTMLEditorKit   Override public ViewFactory getViewFactory       return new HTMLFactory          Override         public View createElement e              View v  super.createe             if v instanceof InlineView                  return new InlineViewe                      Override                     public int getBreakWeightint axis, float pos, float len                          return GoodBreakWeight                                           Override                     public View breakViewint axis, int p0, float pos, float len                          if axis  View.XAXIS                              this.checkPainter                             this.removeUpdatenull, null, null                                                  return super.breakViewaxis, p0, pos, len                                                                else if v instanceof ParagraphView                  return new ParagraphViewe                      Override                     protected SizeRequirements calculateMinorAxisRequirementsint axis, SizeRequirements r                          if r  null                              r  new SizeRequirements                                                  float pref  this.layoutPool.getPreferredSpanaxis                         float min  this.layoutPool.getMinimumSpanaxis                          Dont include insets, Box.getXXXSpan will include them.                          r.minimum  int min                         r.preferred  Math.maxr.minimum, int pref                         r.maximum  Integer.MAXVALUE                         r.alignment  0.5f                         return r                                                                 return v                     codepre

Negative 9921 pIve created a custom Timer Class with public API allowing access to a property timeLeft, and allowing the calling class to start and pause the timer, as well as a Boolean isTimerPaused.  p  pI need the Timer to be initialized and started, and paused inside of my game loop for various situations.

With the timer in the model how do I go about refreshing UI Elements continuously.  My thought was to have some sort of continuous timer in my controller that would update the UILabel with the timeLeft property from the timer, but that seems inefficient and prone to being slightly inaccurate. p  pThanks p
Negative 9921 pI have a .NET 4.5 program that basically runs a loop in which the same stored procedure is executed many times, using the same codeSqlConnectioncode. If a command timeout occurs, it is incremented and the query is rerun this is for testing purposes, in the real application the input parameters to the SP would be modified.p  pThe stored procedure in question can be found below. Basically it is a mix of codeSELECTDELETEUPDATEcode statements. It starts with codeSET XACTABORT ONcode and contains no codeBEGIN TRANcode or codeROLLBACK TRANcode statements.p  pAfter running this program for a while, it seems that the queries are starting to run really slow. Restarting the program does not help, the queries are still running slow. It appears that this slowdown happens after a command timeout has occurred. But running the same query in sql server management studio shows no slowdown.p  pI did some troubleshooting, and copied the SQL and pasted it in a query window in SQL Server Management Studio and tried running it from there After a codeCHECKPOINT DBCC DROPCLEANBUFFERScode, and within a codeBEGIN TRANROLLBACK TRANcode. It ran in about 4 seconds. Consecutive runs takes about 0.5 seconds. p  pThen I did the same from a new .NET console application, and the query was running extremely slow, about 48 seconds this is the duration shown by the SQL Server as well, so it is really executing the query that takes this amount of time. Consecutive runs takes about 17 seconds.p  pSimply running an codeALTERcode command to update the SP without changing it actually solves the problem, and the queries run fast everywhere again, until they start running slow again. p  pI have also tried using codeSqlConnection.ClearAllPoolscode, but this does not appear to help.p  pWhat on earth can cause this behavior I cant think of any reason why SQL Server would start behaving this way.  Why would a query suddenly start running faster if an SP is updated And why would it slow down in the first place, but only from connections from .NETp  pstrongEditstrong  I have now also tried to codeKILLcode all SPIDs possible from codesys.sysprocessescode that were using the database in question. There are a number of system processes that cannot be killed, but this did not resolve the problem.  codesys.dmtranlockscode shows no locks being held Except a single shared database lock.p  pstrongEdit 2strong Bringing the database offline, and then back online also seems to remedy the problem.

Negative 9921 pFolks,p  pI am running Virtualbox on Windows 7. The guest OS also is Windows 7.p  pI configured rdp connection at port 5000 as stated in the documentation and am able to connect to ip5000 using Microsoft Remote Desktop client.p  pHowever, the problem is that the screen of the guest VM is simultaneously being shown on both, local as well as remote, windows.p  pIs there a way to just close the local window without shutting down the VM itself Perhaps something similar to headless virtualbox on Linux.p  pThank you in advance for your help.p  pRegards,br Peter p

Negative 9921 pI am attempting to add a parameter to the JSONPARSER objects makeHttpRequest.  I have a feeling this has to do with the class inheritance, but no luck there.

However, can I program the server to dynamically calculate the average For example, as long as there is a new input, the server update the average and display. If possible, should I be modifying the serverside program like my webpage which displays the average number Or, can I program the database to let it calculate the average and stores the number when new data arrivesp  pThanks a lot.p

Negative 9921 pWere using SWF to take videos through a lengthy process, part of which includes sending them through the Elastic Transcoder.p  pIt looks like the Elastic Transcoder can send an SNS notification when its complete, but I dont see any way for it to signal the SWF so the process can continue.p  pFrom what I can tell, the only options are A set up a URL that SNS can ping when the transcode completes this URL runs a script which signals the SWF.  Or B have SNS send a message into SQS, and write a worker process to constantly check the queue for completed transcodes, and signal the SWF.p  pNeither of those options seems that pleasing.  Ideal would be if the Elastic Transcoder or SNS could signal the SWF directly.  Possiblep

Negative 9921 pHere I have shown 4 files I am using to edit rows of table by taking data from the database.p  pFirst file is DataAdministration.php. when loading this file LoadingPage7 should be shown and after clicking on EditForms I need to show LoadingPage8 div. At the moment when it is displaying for the first time I need to load DisplayData.php inside to LoadingPage8 div. To support that I have used Update.js file. After loading DisplayData.php I need to edit a selected row by clicking on the edit link. Then the editable input box needed to be display in the relevant FormName column.

Negative 9921 pI am porting an existing iOS app to Android. In a special use case, the iOS app uses the flashlight to indicate different states of a progress to the user as the screen must be facing down. It is switched on just for approx. 3 seconds for two times. To make clear the progress even more  make it easier to differ, we want the intensitybrightness of the flashlight to be lower  higher between the states. The iOS app does that, but there seems to be no official or reliable way to control the intensity of the flashlight on Android. I read about a hacky way to set the brightness value by writing to sysclassledsflashlightbrightness or alternatively sysdevicesplatformflashlight.0ledsflashlightbrightness. As my Galaxy S4 does not have these files and so probably many other devices, this solution also doesnt solve my problem. Anyone solved that kind of problem or has a hintp  pThanks.p  pstrongUPDATE Im looking for a reliable solution that works on unrooted devices.strongp

Negative 9921 pI have an excel macroenabled sheet that users open, fill out a list of information name, date, etc and click a save button. This creates a new file name based on the information, and saves the file to a network location. The users then continue to work with the sheet.p  pI forced the users to enable macros excellent tutorial here a hrefhttpdatapigtechnologies.comblogindex.phpforcingyourclientstoenablemacros relnofollowhttpdatapigtechnologies.comblogindex.phpforcingyourclientstoenablemacrosa and that works well, however once the file name changes, macros are disabled. I assume this due to the fact that it is an untrusted network location. The sheet will be used by many different computers, so I would like to find a vba workaround rather than relying on an excel setting.p  pEdit I think I have the answer As mehow said based on the link I have posted, I can first run the part of the macro that finds the file name, then lock the workbook all except the start page, then save the workbook as the new name, then hide the start page and show everything else. That way if macros are disabled once the sheet is saved it should force the user to reenable without compromising the protection. Ill post once I find outwhether it will work.p  pEdit It works Thanks.p

Negative 9921 pI am running JBoss AS 7 on port 8080. I am able to access it from my local machine codehttplocalhost8080code. However I am not able to access it from another machine on the same network, e.g. codehttp192.168.1.1048080code does not work. I have disabled the Windows firewall on the local machine. In fact, if I start a Tomacat server on the local machine at port 8080 it is easily accessible from a remote machine. So it is something about the JBoss server that is causing the problem. Any idea on how to fix thisp  pThanks.p

Negative 9921 pI am on a project where I need to create both a custom codeUINavigationBarcode and codeUITabBarcode.  My problem lies in the color of the items the tint color.  I dont want any tint color for my items. I have tried to put it to clear color, but that only makes it disappear It becomes transparent.p  pSo, to recapitulate, I have my own images for my bar items, and they each contains their own specific colors. I have read that, in order to do what I want to do, I must subclass my codeUIBarcodes, but I havent got more information than that. What should I modify in my subclass to get rid of that tint color constraint Thank you.p  pEDIT   The tint color is not applied to the item, but to the bar so all of the items. So my problem is that I want specific colors for my itemsp  pEDIT 2   Ok I think I got it The solution is to use codeUIBarButtonItemcode method  codeinitWithCustomViewcodep  precodeUIButton backBtn  [UIButton buttonWithTypeUIButtonTypeCustom] backBtn.bounds  CGRectMake 0, 0, 26, 26 [backBtn setImage[UIImage imageNamedBackBtn.png] forStateUIControlStateNormal] [backBtn addTargetself.navigationController actionselectorpopViewControllerAnimated forControlEventsUIControlEventTouchUpInside]  UIBarButtonItem item  [[UIBarButtonItem alloc] initWithCustomViewbackBtn] self.navigationItem.leftBarButtonItem  item codepre  pBut that only works for a codeUINavigationBarcode because it takes codeUIBarButtonItemcode. codeUITabBarcode on the other hand only takes codeUITabBarItemcode which doesnt comply with the codeinitWithCustomViewcode. So Im still in a pickle there...p

Negative 9921 pThis is a design question and i want to know if it is fine or not. suppose there is bank system which allows other third parties to do transfers from account to account and only after the owner of the account giving the transfer says yes. so say a third party requests a transfer from the bank, giving the details i.e the sender and receiver accounts, and the amount to be transferred. after getting these details, the bank checks whether the balance in the sender account is sufficient to do the transfer, if it is sufficient, it asks the owner of the sender account to agree with a yes or no through any means sms etc.. if the person agrees, the bank performs the transfer and returns a response with the transaction details.p  pmy question is, can this be implemented using restful http because it is not an actual resource that is being requested but a service to be performed and after that the transaction details are sent back...i hope im understoodp

Negative 9921 pThis may be a naive question. But I hope not. p  pIm working on an JS web app eventually to be placed into PhoneGap. Its a one page game.p  pIts a word game so I have a few variables that are largeish arrays to store dictionary content in for look ups.p  pMy questionsp  ol lipIs there any rule of thumb as to what is too big of an array to keep in memory My biggest array is 3000 items consisting of small text strings. Seems to run fine. Im guessing thats not considered all that big. pli lipIf it is too big or when a variable is too big is there a proper way in JS to unload that variable from memory until its needed later pli ol  pI have a hunch that my realworld example of 3000 item array isnt a cause for concern and is me worrying too much about microoptimization but I am still interested from a general theoretical standpoint When variables are too large to practically keep in memory, is there a proper way to loadunload them as needed in JSp  pUPDATEp  pIm thinking now this question is perhaps naive the more I think about it. p  pIs it fair to say that if I declare a variable, no matter where in my JS code, it, by default, is already in memory as all my JS has to be in memory to run. As such, there really is no loadingunloading of variables. Theyre either there or they are notp

Negative 9921 pI stumbled on a Wikipedia article about the a hrefhttpen.wikipedia.orgwikiXORlinkedlist relnofollowXor linked lista, and its an interesting bit of trivia, but the article seems to imply that it occasionally gets used in real code.  Im curious what its good for, since I dont see why it makes sense even in severely memorycache constrained systemsp  ul liThe main advantage of a regular doubly linked list is the ability to insert or delete elements from the middle of the list given only a pointer to the node to be deletedinserted after.  This cant be done with an xorlinked list.li liIf one wants O1 prepending or O1 insertionremoval while iterating then singly linked lists are good enough and avoid a lot of code complexity and caveats with respect to garbage collection, debugging tools, etc.li liIf one doesnt need O1 prependinginsertionremoval then using an array is probably more efficient in both space and time.  Even if one only needs efficient insertionremoval while iterating, arrays can be pretty good since the insertionremoval can be done while iterating.li ul  pGiven the above, whats the point  Are there any weird corner cases where an xor linked list is actually worthwhilep

Negative 9921 pI have a jQuery .each that loops through div ids and writes JSON data from an AJAX call to inputs assigned a class.  Most divs only have one row of inputs to populate, but some have two rows of input classes.  All divs and classes are created dynamically, but each dynamic div does get its own unique ID.  p  pWhen the .each hits the div with two rows with the same class it does not write to both rows but writes to the second row of classes with the second row from the database.  When users write to the db with the data from both rows it creates a separate row in the db.  One for badge1 and one for badge2. Here is my .each that writes one row of inputs greatp  precode.eachdata, functioni, item        item.fullopid.find.badge1.valitem.badge1       item.fullopid.find.badge2.valitem.badge2       item.fullopid.find.opdate.valitem.opdate       item.fullopid.find.opqty.valitem.opqty  codepre  pI have tried several things including an ifelse statement on just those ids with two rows of classes.  I understand that when the .each sees the two rows it basically sees it as one row since they have the same class names except for badge1badge2.  Should I run another loop inside the .each to loop through and write both rows for that div id and same input classes  If so, how should I do this  p  pBackground on app  Created with Foundation 5, dynamically creates each panel row with data from one db MSSQL, then using AJAXJSON users write to a separate db MYSQL their input data.  The user should then be able to pull up the job again and see what they have done by pulling their data from the MYSQL db of their inputs.  That is the db I am pulling the data from when trying to insert the JSON data to the inputs for each div row and inputs.p  pHere is the HTML that creates these two rows  p  precodeltdiv classrow idopdividgt     ltdiv classlarge3 columns badgedivgt         ltlabelgtOperator 1 ltspan classbadgerequired stylefontsize 0.7emgtrequiredltspangt             ltdiv classrow collapsegt                 ltdiv classsmall3 columnsgt                     ltbutton classbutton prefix radius badgescanbutton onclickbadgeButton1thisgt                         Scan                     ltbuttongt                 ltdivgt                 ltdiv classsmall9 columnsgt                     ltinput typetext classbadge1 namebadge1 onchangebadgeColor1this placeholderBadge Numbergt                     ltinput typehidden classtimeassigned nametimeassigned valuegt                 ltdivgt             ltdivgt ltlabelgt     ltdivgt     ltdiv classlarge3 columns datedivgt         ltlabelgtTodays Date ltspan classdaterequired stylefontsize 0.7emgtrequiredltspangt             ltinput typetext classopdate nameopdate onclickpopDatethis placeholderTodays Dategt         ltlabelgt     ltdivgt     ltdiv classlarge3 columns qtydivgt         ltlabelgtQuantity ltspan classqtyrequired stylefontsize 0.7emgtrequiredltspangt             ltinput typetext classopqty nameopqty onbluropQtyColorthis placeholderQuantitygt         ltlabelgt     ltdivgt     ltdiv classlarge3 columnsgt         ltlabelgtComplete Operationltlabelgt         ltbutton classbutton postfix saveop1 onclicksaveOp1thisgt             Save         ltbuttongt     ltdivgt ltdivgt  ltdiv classrow idopdivid2gt     ltdiv classlarge3 columns badgedivgt         ltlabelgtOperator 2 ltspan classbadgerequired stylefontsize 0.7emgtrequiredltspangt             ltdiv classrow collapsegt                 ltdiv classsmall3 columnsgt                     ltbutton classbutton prefix radius badgescanbutton onclickbadgeButton2thisgt                         Scan                     ltbuttongt                 ltdivgt                 ltdiv classsmall9 columnsgt                     ltinput typetext classbadge2 namebadge2 onchangebadgeColor2this placeholderBadge Numbergt                     ltinput typehidden classtimeassigned nametimeassigned valuegt                 ltdivgt             ltdivgt ltlabelgt     ltdivgt     ltdiv classlarge3 columns datedivgt         ltlabelgtTodays Date ltspan classdaterequired stylefontsize 0.7emgtrequiredltspangt             ltinput typetext classopdate nameopdate onclickpopDatethis placeholderTodays Dategt         ltlabelgt     ltdivgt     ltdiv classlarge3 columns qtydivgt         ltlabelgtQuantity ltspan classqtyrequired stylefontsize 0.7emgtrequiredltspangt             ltinput typetext classopqty nameopqty onbluropQtyColorthis placeholderQuantitygt         ltlabelgt     ltdivgt     ltdiv classlarge3 columnsgt         ltlabelgtComplete Operationltlabelgt         ltbutton classbutton postfix saveop2 onclicksaveOp2thisgt             Save         ltbuttongt     ltdivgt ltdivgt codepre  pAny assistance is greatly appreciated.  p

Negative 9921 pI am writing a web application that needs to take input from a barcode scanner.p  pCurrently, the system printing the barcode is adding a 13 I think a carriage return to the beginning of the value.  Thus, whenever the barcode is scanned for example into firefox, the cursor jumps to the search bar and puts the value there rather than in my text field.p  pI definitely cannot modify the printed barcodes themselves.  Is there a way to prevent the barcode from changing the input field from my text box to the search barp  pThanksp

Negative 9921 pI would really like to use YAML config for Spring Boot, as I find it quite readable and useful to have a single file showing what properties are active in my different profiles. Unfortunately, Im finding that setting properties in codeapplication.ymlcode can be rather fragile.p  pThings like using a tab instead of spaces will cause properties to not exist without warnings as far as I can see, and all too often I find that my active profiles are not being set, due to some unknown issue with my YAML.p  pSo I was wondering whether there are any hooks that would enable me to get hold of the currently active profiles and properties, so that I could log them.p  pSimilarly, is there a way to cause startup to fail if the codeapplication.ymlcode contains errors Either that or a means for me to validate the YAML myself, so that I could kill the startup process.p

Negative 9921 pHelp me solve this problem and improve my script. This is a long post, please bear with me. I am writing a small web app which helps users to maintain wishlist of products they are interested. I am using MongoDB to store the data and Python Tornado as server. p  pThere are two collections in database, one for storing product details and another to maintain user details. Whenever user adds a new product link, the url will be added to products collection and its object id will be added users document. Its actually a list and to which it will be added. p  pso, a typical document in product collection will bep  precode   id ObjectId53a2bfcfa7603606c2765342,   name Nexus 7 from Google 7Inch, 16 GB, Black,   url httprads.stackoverflow.comamznclickB00DVFLJDS,   baseprice 222,   currentprice 213.96,  codepre  pand that of users will bep  precode   id ObjectId539c4adea760360886d7ef02,   emailid johnappleseedapple.com,   trackedproducts [     ObjectId53a2bfcfa7603606c2765342,     ObjectId53a2d2ada7603606c2765344,     ObjectId53a2d294a7603606c2765343   ]  codepre  pNow I have written a cron job which runs once everyday and updates the codecurrentpricecode. If codecurrentpricecode goes below codebasepricecode I have to send an alert to the user. This is were it gets tricky for me. I want to send the email even if any one of the product price changes.p  pA simple but inefficient way will be, check price and if there is a change in price then add a new value in product document. May be codealert yescode and then loop through all users, loop through each of object ids of tracked products, if any document matching these object ids has alert field as yes then add the user email to email queue. And another cron job to reset alert. The code will bep  precodeemailidqueue  [] for product in product.collection      price changed if yes, then update      addupdate alert yes      ...     product.collection.saveproduct  for user in users.collection     for productid in user[trackedproducts]         product  productscollection.findid productid         if product.getalert, None             emailidqueue.appenduser[emailid]             break   send emails to all of those who are in emailidqueue codepre  pI found above implementation not efficient and I am sure there could be many ways to improve it. As now I have following solution, every time I find a product whose price is changed, I add that to a separate list. And when I loop through the user, I will just check whether it has any of those object ids are not. p  precodeemailidqueue  [] pricechangedproducts  set  for product in product.collection      price changed if yes, then update      ...      ...     pricechangedproducts.addproduct[id]     product.collection.saveproduct  for user in users.collection     if setuser[trackedproducts] amp pricechangedproducts         emailidqueue.appenduser[emailid]   send emails to all of those who are in emailidqueue codepre  pA user on reddit suggested me an alternative. I will maintain another collection, may be called codetrackerscode. This collection will have productids and the object ids of user document of who are tracking it. May be something like thisp  precode     id ObjectId77a2bfcfa7603606c2765399,     productid ObjectId53a2bfcfa7603606c2765342,     subscribers [user1email.com, user2email.com, user3email.com]  codepre  pNow whenever there is a price change, I will add list of subscribers of that product to email queue. This wont require any extra looping. I can do this whenever I am checking for new prices the earlier for loop. p  pHowever if I want to send other notifications also, like Chrome alerts, iOS push etc, above wont work. So I thought lets keep track of codeuseridcode instead of their emails. Something likep  precode     id ObjectId77a2bfcfa7603606c2765399,     productid ObjectId53a2bfcfa7603606c2765342,     subscribers [ObjectId12a2bfcfa7603606c2765399, ObjectId14a2bfcfa7603606c2765399, ObjectId56a2bfcfa7603606c2765399]  codepre  pAnd then query the DB again with the object ids of users and send notifications. So finally it will bep  precodeuseridsqueue  set  for product in product.collection      price changed if yes, then update      ...      ...      find the subscribers     productdocument  db.trackers.findoneproductid product[id]     useridsqueue.addproductdocument[trackers]     product.collection.saveproduct   now send notifications to each of those users  for userid in useridsqueue     userdocument  db.users.findoneid userid      now send notifications     addtoemailqueueuserdocument[email]     addtochromequeueuserdocument[chromeid]     addtoiosqueueuserdocument[iospushid]      etc codepre  pBut can I make it even better Any help is appreciated Thank youp

One particular item in the ListView is changing a mode of operation.

Initial values can be set but are not being updated. I know that I need to call .notifyDataSetChanged, but as I would like this to happen inside onItemClick for the Dialog, I get an error along the lines of Cannot refer to a nonfinal variable inside an inner class defined in a different method, and my variables cannot be final.p  pWhat I have triedp  ul liNotifying the data change immediately before the dialog closes. Got nonfinal variable error.li liImplementing a modelviewcontroller setup and trying to create a method that acts like an onVariableChangeListener, but I left this idea because it seemed a bit offtopic and I wasnt quite understanding it.li liCreate one method to bring up the Dialog and another to update the ListView data. The issue was that the Update method was not waiting for the Dialog item to be clicked. Even after the dialog selection is changed and reopened, the ListView is not updated.li liCreating a method, operating similarly to onCreateView, that is called whenever the item is clicked. It should create and inflate a new ListView. Since it is called within onItemClick it does not have the nonfinal variable error, though it required me to create final instances of onCreateViews parameters. I am unsure of the implications this has. Is this a valid approachli ul  pThe following code is a mix of the latter two ideas. There are methods for the Dialog and update separately, though updating does not wait for the dialog and the parameters going into the update method are final.p  pI am hoping the solution will be straightforward, but I believe there are multiple errors at work.

Negative 9921 pCan anyone tell me how I would go about checking if a database and tables exists in sql server from a vb.net project What I want to do is check if a database exists preferably in an If statement, unless someone has a better way of doing it and if it does exist I do one thing and if it doesnt exist I create the database with the tables and columns. Any help on this matter would be greatly appreciated. p  pEditp  pThe application has a connection to a server. When the application runs on a PC I want it to check that a database exists, if one exists then it goes and does what its supposed to do, but if a database does NOT exist then it creates the database first and then goes on to do what its supposed to do. So basically I want it to create the database the first time it runs on a PC and then go about its business, then each time it runs on the PC after that I want it to see that the database exists and then go about its business. The reason I want it like this is because this application will be on more than one PC, I only want the database and tables created once, the first time it runs on a PC and then when it runs on a different PC, it sees that the database already exists and then run the application using the existing database created on the other PC.p

What I want is when the app is backgrounded I need just to activate it like iOS does and navigate to required page faster activation and avoid reauthentication.p  pHow can I achieve this and modify the code abovep

Negative 9921 pWe have a Vagrant setup running Ubuntu 12.04 as the guest OS across our team where the host OS is Windows 7 or 8. What Id like to be able to do is to is to get the hostname of the Windows host machine and append this to the Vagrant hostname during setup e.g.p  precodeconfig.vm.hostname  ltwindows hostnamegtweb codepre  pThis is because we have several developers connecting to external services from their local dev machines and if we all have the same hostname set as the Vagrant file is source controlled and is the same for everyone then in the logs for these external services we cant differentiate who made what request to the service. I thought if we were able to dynamically get the hostname from the host OS it would be a good way to identify individual guest OSes running on each developers machine.p  pIs this possible and if so what is the best way to achieve itp

Negative 9921 pI want to add a console to my application, and heres my problem.p  pIn Qt Creator, I create a new Project, I select Qt Console Application, convert it from using codeQCoreApplicationcode to codeQApplicationcode, add codecorecode codeguicode codewidgetscode to the codeQTcode configuration flag in the project file, and it works. I can create windows while having a console window. So the project file looks like this...p  precodeQT  core gui widgets  TARGET  ConsoleApp CONFIG  console CONFIG  appbundle TEMPLATE  app  sources... codepre  pThis is working perfectly and I could develop a full GUI app with this however, the app is already built. When I created the project for the app, I chose Qt Widgets Application. So I thought I could just copy the configuration of the ConsoleApps project file over to my apps project file. So My apps project file looks like this...p  precodeQT  core gui widgets  TARGET  GuiApp CONFIG  console CONFIG  appbundle TEMPLATE  app  sources... codepre  pBut this is not showing me a console and I dont understand why.  I know I could just create a Console Application and just transfer my source over which right there solves my problem, but I wanna know... why is the console not showing up in my GUI app despite using the exact same configuration as the console app in the project filep  pIm compiling with Qt 5.3.1 MSVC2013 OpenGL 64bit on Windows 8 64bit, all in Qt Creator 3.1.2p

Negative 9921 pMy first question on StackOverflow so bear with me .. p  pI want to create a scheduled agent, to run say tonight between 2300 and 0100, every half an hour. It MUST NOT run befpre then.p  pDomino seems to have me snookered.p  pIf I set the agent schedule to be more than once a day, every half hour, between the times as above, with target All Documents .. it runs straight away after I save it.p  pIf I disable it, set all this up, then enable it .. it runs straight away after being enabled.p  pIt seems that if you have an agent whcih should run more than once a day, it always runs right away. p  pNote that Im aware I can put some LotusScript code in the agent to quit if the time is before say 2100 so that the first run doesnt do anything. Surely .. I shouldnt need to do thatp  pBut anyway, this doesnt help if the agent is a Formula one. Theres no option to quit like that, unless you put in something like p  precodeifhournowlt21returncontinue codepre  p.. as the first line which is really messy.p  pSo .. the questionp  pHow can I set it up so that I save the agent to run more than once a day, and it only runs after the time I specify p  pThanksp  pstrongEDITstrong  with a LotusScript agent there are a few options on how to stop the first run. However the real issue was a Formula agent. I didnt write the agent and there isnt time to rewrite it in LotusScipt so it has to be formula. Its also much faster in Formula p  pThe agent ran on 22,000 documents and changed one simple field. The ifhournowlt21returncontinue   line would work but its really clumsy.p

Negative 9921 pIs there a way to use CDI Extensions in Spring projects Some sort of bridging technologyp  pSome libraries in this case the a hrefhttpsgithub.comt1messageapi relnofollowMessage Apia use CDI Extensions to create and inject Beans on the fly when injecting an interface.

Spring of course knows nothing about the CDI Extension and rightfully complains that there is no implementation for the interface I want to inject.p  pCreating a proxy service with CDI instead of Spring is a possible workaround, but would be very cumbersome.p  pGoogle only gives me ways to inject Spring Beans in a pure Java EE project using a CDI Extension.

Negative 9921 pI want to create an application where user can see the location of other device by number. The number will be fetched from devices contact list. On installing the application you agree that your location is visible to anyone who has your number.p  pSuppose there are two devices A and B, and both have the app installed. In device A user opens the app, and he can see the location of device B in map.

So the notification will be some kind of database write, the database write will be A has accessed your location at X time.p  pSomeone told me that I need a server in between that sends notification to and fro, and the device needs to run a background process so that its keeps listening to the notification, similar to WhatsApp or Viber.p  pIs there any other way to implement this besides the intermediate server approach.

Negative 9921 pIm trying to make work an embedded linux on a CSB337 board with AT91RM9200 ARM920T. I compile the kernel 3.2.63 using at91rm9200defconfig. I see the kernel booting but I have a problem with rootfs initrd. I will try to explain the context but if its not necessary you can go directly to kernel messages at the end of the topic.p  pAs I understood I am a new in the embedded linux world, I have a choice for mounting the rootfs initramfs, initrd, nfs or jffs2 directly from the flash. My first goal is to make work linux, no matter how. So all solutions are acceptable for me but I have to choose one to start with. The solution with jffs2 seems to be the most difficult because my flash is already formated as TFS almost unknown filesystem from MicroMonitor bootloader. The solution with nfs could be great at least for tests but I have difficulties to make work nfs even between two linux PCs. So, at final, I have to choose between initramfs and initrd. I have decided to start with initrd because I believe that its more flexible to do modifications than initramfs.p  pTo create the rootfs I have used busybox with a minimum configuration deleted all applets except Init utilities, static compile. After that, I compress the rootfs as img.gz and send it on the target memory by tftp at the same maner as zImage. I use the kernel booting arguments rootdevram0 rw initrd0x20100000,307331. As a result, I have this kernel outputp  precodeUncompressing Linux... done, booting the kernel.

Negative 9921 pIm working on a legacy swing application.p  pThis app has a customised codeJTextAreacode in a codeJScrollPanecode.p  pThe problem I have is that when the application loses focus e.g. AltTabs to another app, the scrollbar and caret position return to the top.  What I want to happen is that when focus is lost, the caret position and scroll value remain unchanged.p  pI currently have a focus listener which stores the caret position and scroll bar value when focus is lost and sets it again when focus is gained.  Which works.  However it looks a little shonky because the scroll bar still jumps to the top when focus is lost and moves back when focus is gained.p  pIs there a way to suppress the focus event, or otherwise stop the scroll bar moving when focus is lostp

Negative 9921 pIm not sure if i have completely wrapped my head around this idea  but Ill try my best to clearly describe what I am trying to do here.p  pI have a factory that changes and parses a URL for me, so I can pass params into a controller for use that were stored in the url. This is sort of so I can save a state for the user and they can share it via copying of a URL send it to their friends or bookmark it or we.p  pI am trying to set up a factory or service that listens for locationChangeSuccess  so that if the user mofies the url and presses enter, it will refresh the scopes in the controllers. So here is what I havep  precode   .factoryurlFactory, functionlocation, freshUrl, StateString      request to change new url     requestObj.requestState  functionmoduleName, stateName, startVar            request item from url, via your module and state name     requestObj.parseState  functionmoduleName, stateName      codepre  pI dropped the center out if it is needed im happy to link, but those just get and set the url for me.p  pSo in the controllers I do something like p  precode scope.mod2m3  urlFactory.parseStatemodule2, mod3 scope.mod2m4  urlFactory.parseStatemodule2, mod4 codepre  pSo when they land on the page, they pull their state. This works great. However, now im trying to solve some edge case scenarios where maybe the user modifies the url.p  pSo I can latch onto that even pretty easily with p  precode .factoryurlWatcher, functionlocation, scope     var urlWatcher        scope.onlocationChangeSuccess, functionevent              console.logAsdsa               return urlWatcher  codepre  pHowever, where I am struggling is trying to determine a way where when this fires, it would connect the new value to the scope in the controller. It was suggested to me that a callback of some sort in the parse set function, but I am struggling with how to approach that. It would be super cool if I could set a way for this factoryservice to re send the new value when it changes to the right place. Callback sounds good, however I dont know how to config this correct.p  pThe easiest route would be to just do an p  precode scope.onlocationChangeSuccess, functionevent              console.logAsdsa         codepre  pIn each controller and manually bind to each scope, but I am trying to make this as modular as possible and thats also a ton of watchers on the locationchangesuccess. would be fantastic if I could figuire out a clean way to set the servicefactory to listen once, and on change find the right modulecontroller and change the value.p  pI cant seem to think a clear route, so I would be very greatful for any insight to this issue. Thank you very much for readingp

Would it be better to use jQuerys codenotcode selector here and rule out all flyouts for areas that can be touched to close the flyout or is there a better way to handle this A good example of what Im trying to achieve is how Amazon are handling their flyouts in the right side of their main navigation. Tap once to open, tap again to follow the link, or tapscroll anywhere else to close the flyout. Im pushing to completely refactor the way these flyouts are handled so that mobiletouch is considered from the start but, at least for now, Id like to figure out a way to achieve what I mentioned above.p  pThanks in advance.p

Negative 9921 pI am using node.js amp nodeardrone to program my AR.Drone 2.0 to perform some basic flight maneuvers indoors. From what I can tell, the drone seems to never fly straight. It will always sway to the left and right, hover for a few seconds, or crash into a wall regardless of where I set the takeoff point from. In other words, if I run the same program to fly down a hallway 10 times, each time it will do something different. p  pIf it does make it down a hallway it will land somewhere different each time. I would have builtin counter moves to adjust for the random swaying such as if it sways to the right, I would tell it to shift to the left, but it never seems to be enough. No amount of counter moves seems to get it to fly straight. I am using the latest firmware on the drone.p  pI was told that there is nothing on board the drone that corrects errors during flight, such as a feedback loop. In addition to this I was also told that these drones were primarily made for use outdoors or in very wide open spaces such that it wont crash. p  pI wanted to see if this held true with anyone else or if anyone had any suggestions to get it to fly straight. Any input or comment would be helpfulp

But lets say one of the base class member functions it NOT wanted in one of the derived classes. Is there a way to explicitly ban an inherited function in a derived classp  pRealisticly we could be talking about a base class that has a 1000 members, and we want to inherit 999 of them, so simply abandoning inheritance and just duplicating all the code will result in very bad code maintainability.p  pMaking that function in the base class virtual, and providing a dummy implementation of it in the codespecialDerivedcode class would work. But what if that function has an actual return type, instead of codevoidcode The codespecialDerivedcode class would then have to provide an implementation that returns something. The caller then could assume that the value they got is something meaningful, when its really not, and thats a problem.p  pSimply implementing the virtual function in codespecialDerivedcode with a single codethrowcode in the body could be a solution, as long as some documentation exists that explicitly states that calling this function on objects of this specific derived type has no meaning, and that this operation will throw. I think this is one possible solution, but Im not sure if its the best way to go.p

Negative 9921 pIm making a gesture recognition program in c with opencv. So before recognising the gesture, I need to first obtain a filtered binary image of the personspecifically hands. Most tutorials suggest using HSV colour filtering. But this method is very inefficient because the colour of the person has to be different from the background. So I searched more and found an alternative called background substraction. But only backgroundsubtracterMOG2 exists and there is always an overlap between the previously filtered frame and the current one. Is there any way to eliminate this overlap or is there a more efficient way to filter the binary imagep

Negative 9921 pI want to be able to assign the same FQDN to two hosts within a network. I would have only 1 host, say h1 active at any time and want to dynamically assign FQDN of h1 to h2 when h1 goes down crashes. Is this possible at allp  pWith my limited knowledge of networking, I think I will have to use a VIP to point to h1. So, in DNS I will make an entry for h1 FQDN and the VIP, where VIP will point to h1. When h1 goes down, I will have to update the DNS to have the VIP point to h2 and reassign h1 FQDN to h2. Is this understanding correct Or do I have better faster options p  pI cannot use a load balancer. These hosts will never be exposed to outside world and other hosts accessing them will also be inside a private nw.p

Negative 9921 pThis is my code for making a Langford Sequence out of an array of pairs of numbers 112233  312132.  I wanted to write a recursive function, because I wasnt able to find one online anywhere as a selfimprovement exercise with algorithms.  My question is, how do I optimize it  Is there a way to apply dynamic programming to this and have a better timespace complexity with emphasis on time complexity  My current Runtime complexity is On2 and Space complexity of On.  Any sort of help in writing cleaner code is also appreciated.  Thanks.

Negative 9921 pSo I have a project where I am using an XML document to store data that will be used by several users. User will need to read the contents of the XML, make changes by adding or removing elements, and then save the XML for others to see.p  pThe problem that I am having has to do with browsers caching the XML file. Because of this, a user can successfully read, change, and save a document without other users seeing the changes. Even the user that makes the changes cannot access the new file by default. The server file has changed successfully, but users are viewing the cached file rather than the most recent version.p  pAs I understand it, if the version of the file changes that should force a browser to use the higher version rather than the cached version. However, I cant figure out how to change the version number of the XML file I am saving. Even if I manually change the version of my XML document, my code changes it back to 1.0 and I dont know why or how.p  pHere is my javascript that alters the XMLp  precode This function modifies the XMLDoc which stores the xml information from          userslogins.xml It then calls SaveData to write the modified information to file  function RemoveFromXMLattribute           This is the tag we will be removing             var removeElement  XMLDoc.getElementsByTagNameattribute[0]           This removes the element from the document          removeElement.parentNode.removeChildremoveElement           Now we save the document with the new changes             SaveData    Updates the userslogins.xml document  function SaveData           Data to Save and file at which to save          var sendData  This is new data     var path  saveUserXML.php           Create the data based upon the contents of XMLDoc          sendData  new XMLSerializer.serializeToStringXMLDoc            Send the sendData to the php file           xmlhttp.openPOST,path,false     xmlhttp.setRequestHeaderContenttype,applicationxwwwformurlencoded     xmlhttp.sendasendData   codepre  pAnd my PHP file that actually writes the XMLp  precodeltphp  myfile  fopenuserslogins.xml, w fwritemyfile, POST[a] fclosemyfile  echo Finished.  gt codepre  pAgain, my goal is to prevent users from viewing the cached version of the XML file when the file has been changed. If there is a better way than changing the version after every alteration I would be open to that.p

Negative 9921 pI am fairly new to android and have been playing around with the codedesigncode library and codeappcompatcode library. I have read most of the documentation for FAB and I could not find anything regarding FAB menu. br  p  pWhat I want to achieve is somewhere in the lines of Inbox FAB implementation. I have found a few libraries as well which have implemented it. a hrefhttpsgithub.comClansFloatingActionButton relnofollowThisa is one example that seems promising. However, I see this as an opportunity to write custom view and viewgroups and learn about this as well. Only issue being I am a big time noob on Android and have got no idea how to implement it.p  pWhat I think would be reasonable implementationbr 1. Define a custom codeViewgroupcode which takes a menu resource file attribute in xml and inflate that in the codeViewgroupcode implementation class.br 2. The custom codeViewgroupcode will have the FAB that is to be shown default, and on click of the FAB, the FAB menu appears.brp  pPlease guide me how to implement it. Thanks.p  pstrongNotestrong I know this will reinventing the wheel, but I think learning how to create custom codeViewgroupcode and codeViewcode is an important aspect of android development.p
