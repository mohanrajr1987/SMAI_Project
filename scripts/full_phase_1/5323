Positive 5323 pI am trying to make a functional scaleslider on a tkinter canvas. I need the button on the slider to be clickdraggable along the slider length and also an increment and decrement button on either side to change the value by  1. The key factor is that, although the slider might be the same size graphically, I want to be able to change the maximum value it can go to with every instance of the class I have created for it. Obviously, I dont want the sliding button to go over the edges of the slider so the graphical range would actually be the maximum x position on canvas  offset  the width of the button. Lastly, I need the leftmost position to have a value of 0 and the rightmost position to have a value equal to that of the maximum value with roughly equal portions in between. So if the scale went from values 0 to 24, I could drag the button to a point where I can obtain any number from 123 aswell.p  pI worked out that the relationship between the value and the graphical size which may also be changed in an instance if desired is brx position on canvas  offset  maximum x position on canvas  offset  current value  maximum value bri.e. xxMax  nnMax brTherefore if we know n then x  n  xMax  nMax brand if we know x then n  x  nMax  xMaxp  pEDIT as Ive fixed the bugs regarding the incrementdecrement buttons My problem is that the scale button is not representing the values that it should e.g. it can go from 33168 when it should only go from 0150.p  pI would greatly appreciate some help as I think Ive been staring at the same code for too long and lost my way. Ive played around with it a lot so i think there might be an offset error but it may also has something to do with the graphical representation of pixels wherein a single difference of 1 value might have a difference of 1.7385 example pixels, and so the decimals add up or it rounds it to 2 pixels to draw it and then when the position is taken to find the value it finds a different value than that which was initially drawn...p  precodefrom tkinter import   class Slider     def initself, parent, x, y, settingPaneOffset0, w140, h15, default4, numRange150         self.parent  parent         self.settingPaneOffset  settingPaneOffset         self.offsetX  settingPaneOffset  x  10  Only going to be used in relation to the scale which has an addition offset of 10px because of the decrement button and spacing         self.offsetY  y         self.w  w         self.h  h  Height of all elements inline with scale         self.btnW  w20         self.defaultValue  default         self.xMax  w  2self.btnW         self.nMax  numRange          u  xw  Width of scale  the x offset coordinate         v  yh  Height  the y offset coordinate         self.decrementBtn  self.parent.createrectanglex, y, x8, v, filla3a3a3, width1, outline606060         self.scaleBack  self.parent.createrectanglex10, y, u10, v, fill8f8f8f, width1, outline606060         self.incrementBtn  self.parent.createrectangleu12, y, u20, v, filla3a3a3, width1, outline606060          self.scaleBtn  self.parent.createrectangle0, 0, 0, 0, filla3a3a3, width1, outline606060         self.num  self.parent.createtext0, 0, text, fill333333, fontTimes New Roman, 10         self.draw      def drawself         self.resetScale         bindList  self.scaleBack, self.scaleBtnClick, 0,                     self.scaleBtn, self.scaleBtnClick, 0,                     self.scaleBtn, self.scaleBtnClick, ltB1Motiongt,                     self.incrementBtn, self.incrementBtnClick, 0,                     self.decrementBtn, self.decrementBtnClick, 0,                     self.scaleBack, lambda e self.colourButtonself.scaleBtn, a3a3a3, 1,                     self.scaleBtn, lambda e self.colourButtonself.scaleBtn, a3a3a3, 1,                     self.incrementBtn, lambda e self.colourButtonself.incrementBtn, a3a3a3, 1,                     self.decrementBtn, lambda e self.colourButtonself.decrementBtn, a3a3a3, 1         self.bindTagsbindList      def bindTagsself, bindList         for i in bindList             e  0ltButtonPress1gt, 1ltButtonRelease1gt.geti[2], i[2]             self.parent.tagbindi[0], e, i[1]      def colourButtonself, obj, c self.parent.itemconfigobj, fillc     def getNumself, x return x  self.nMax  self.xMax     def getScalePosself, n return n  self.xMax  self.nMax     def getScaleBtnself, centre return [self.offsetXcentreself.btnW, self.offsetXcentreself.btnW]      def showNumberOfSeatsself, x, n         self.parent.coordsself.num, xself.btnW, self.offsetY8         self.parent.itemconfigself.num, textn      def redrawScaleself, btnCoords, nNone         self.n  roundself.getNumbtnCoords[0]self.btnW ifn is None else n         self.parent.coordsself.scaleBtn, btnCoords[0], self.offsetY, btnCoords[1], self.offsetY  self.h         self.showNumberOfSeatsbtnCoords[0], self.n      def scaleBtnClickself, event         self.colourButtonself.scaleBtn, c3c3c3         btnCoordsEvt  self.getScaleBtnevent.xself.offsetX         btnCoordsMin  self.getScaleBtnself.btnW         btnCoordsMax  self.getScaleBtnself.xMax  self.btnW         ifevent.xltbtnCoordsMin[0]self.btnW self.redrawScalebtnCoordsMin         elifevent.xgtbtnCoordsMax[1]self.btnW self.redrawScalebtnCoordsMax         else self.redrawScalebtnCoordsEvt      def incrementBtnClickself, event         self.colourButtonself.incrementBtn, c3c3c3         ifself.n lt self.nMax             self.n  1             self.redrawScaleself.getScaleBtnself.getScalePosself.n  self.btnW, self.n      def decrementBtnClickself, event         self.colourButtonself.decrementBtn, c3c3c3         ifself.n gt 0             self.n  1             self.redrawScaleself.getScaleBtnself.getScalePosself.n  self.btnW, self.n      def resetScaleself         self.n  self.defaultValue         btnCoords  self.getScaleBtnself.getScalePosself.n         self.parent.coordsself.scaleBtn, btnCoords[0]self.settingPaneOffset, self.offsetY, btnCoords[1]self.settingPaneOffset, self.offsetYself.h         self.showNumberOfSeatsbtnCoords[0]self.settingPaneOffset, self.n   def callbackevent     printclicked at, event.x, event.y  ifnamemain     root  Tk     root.titleSlider on a canvas     canvas  Canvasroot, bgFFFFFF, width600, height400, borderwidth0, highlightthickness0     canvas.pack     s0  Slidercanvas, 100, 50     s1  Slidercanvas, 100, 100, default5, numRange10     s2  Slidercanvas, 100, 150, default8, numRange20     s3  Slidercanvas, 100, 200, default10, numRange15     root.bindltButton1gt, callback     root.mainloop codepre

Positive 5323 pIm attempting to display a progress bar while an app is running walking a music library folder tree but that doesnt matter here. Disclaimer ... Im learning Tkinter as I go along Im putting it into a separate window for the moment I dont want to disturb the main window design  implementation just yet.p  pIve tried this two ways ... my own crudely drawn progress bar using a text widget, and  once I discovered it  ttk.Progressbar.   Im having essentially the same problem with either approach, which is getting the contents of the window to display. p  pIll focus on the approach using ttk.Progressbar.p  pI gather that I use updateidletasks to force an update of the window.   However that seems to blank the window contents.   Full demo ie standalone code is at the end of this.p  pBasically if I halt the program after the widgets are all created, the window displays the progress bar etc. just fine.br If I dont force an error, the window doesnt open until the program ends then it displays fine.p  pIf I use updateidletasks to force window update, the window opens, but is blank. If the program ends normally or by forced error the window contents are shown properly.p  p[There was a related behaviour in the kludged version ... the Label field with the text progress bar would update correctly on each updateidletasks but the window background shows white not the correct ivory colour]p  pWhat is the correct way to force the window to update eg in the main program loopp  precodeimport tkinter as Tk import tkinter.font as TkF from tkinter import ttk import time  class StatusBarTk.Frame      def initself, master         Tk.Frame.initself, master         self.customFont2  TkF.FontfamilyCalibri, size12, weightbold         self.customFont5  TkF.FontfamilyCambria, size16, weightbold         self.configbackgroundivory2         self.grid         self.createwidgets      def createwidgetsself          self.msg  Tk.Labelself, textgt, bgivory2, fgblue4, fontself.customFont2         self.msg.gridrow0, column0, stickyTk.W          self.bar  ttk.Progressbarself, length300, modeindeterminate         self.bar.gridrow1, column0, stickyTk.W          self.btnabort  Tk.Buttonself, text Abort , commandself.abort, fontself.customFont2, fgmaroon         self.btnabort.gridrow2,column0, stickyTk.W         self.rowconfigure2, pad3          printwidgets done      def Startself, msg         self.msg.configuretextmsg         self.bar.start     def Stopself, msg         self.msg.configuretextmsg         self.bar.stop      def abortself          eventually will raise an error to the calling routine to stop the process         self.destroy   def main     printstart     tkroot  Tk.Tk     tkroot.titleStatus Bar     tkroot.geometry500x75     tkroot.configurebgivory2     Bar  StatusBartkroot     Bar.StartDemo      z10     to halt to verify the Status Bar window contents Ok, which they are     for k in range20          Bar.settest, k   for determinatge version, to be added later         time.sleep0.3         Bar.updateidletasks   window opens, but blank.

Positive 5323 pThis is a follow up to a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions32900061howdoiscaletkintercanvaswindowwithoutchangingobjectsScale Tkinter window without changing objectsap  pThis is also a bit of a styleopinion question as well.p  pI would like to put objects on to a Tkinter canvas in engineering units inches. If I use canvas.scale... it will modify the objects, which is not what I wish to do. p  pIs there a way to easily clone a canvas. I would place my objects on one canvas. Then when it came time to display it. I would copy all the objects on that canvas to a second canvas. The second canvas would then get canvas.scale... applied to it. All of my work would be done on the first canvas. I do not see an easy  elegant way to copy objects from one canvas to another directly without having to determine what the object is, then create it, then set all of its parameters. Something likep  precodeWorkingCanvasCanvasroot,width36,height10 ScaledCanvasCanvasroot,width1800,height300 WorkingCanvas.createoval0,0,0.3125,0.3125  this is in inches for object in WokingCanvas.getobjects     ScaledCanvas.addobjectobject WorkingCanvas.scaleScaleX,ScaleY,0,0 codepre  pOnly ScaledCanvas would ever be displayed ScaledCanvas.pack. Working Canvas would just remain unpacked, but all of the objects would remain in engineering units.p  pStyle Question I would like to do the above because the scaling happens once in one place. Easy to maintain. I do it once and forget about it.p  pThe other approach that comes to mind to to create a sub class for all object create and manipulate functions. Each of those functions would quietly apply the scale function. This means that canvas.create would need the scaling as well as canvas.move etc. I would also have to keep track of the current scale and the new scale if the window is resized apply that ratio to current items and then begin applying the new scale to any objects that are added  moved.p  pEven as I type this I do not at all like that approach. Seems hard to maintain.p

Positive 5323 pI am building a GUI application to monitorcontrol remote embedded client devices.  Each clients state machine is maintained in a master dictionary and is to be represented in the GUI as an instance of a tab Frame in a Notebook widget.  I want to instantiate a tab defined as a class in my application whenever a new client registers and hide or forget the tab when the client link times out.  Ill reinstantiate ifwhen the client reregisters.p  pIm new to Python, Tkinter and OO in general and am struggling with program structure.  I need to continuously loop through the dictionary records to refresh the GUI, but Ive concluded I cant iterate within the root.mainloop structure.  So external changes in state machine dictionary records or elements need to refresh corresponding GUI Notebook tab instances externally, including creating and removing instances of my tab class.p  pIm confident there is a standard practice but I havent progressed sufficiently in my learning to figure this out.  Some quick suggestions to nudge me in the right direction would be appreciated.p

Positive 5323 pHow do I scale a Tkinter canvas itself. I am creating an application where it would be far more elegant  that is to say much more readable if I can plot things on a tkinter canvas in engineering units inches and simply scale the canvas to the window. The attached code is quite over simplified for what I want to to but I believe that it gets the point across. I would like to apply the scale factor once instead of each and every time I add an object to the canvas. I would like the canvas to represent 36 inches or whatever and be scaled so that 36 inches is 1800 pixels wide or whatever window width. Once established this scale factor would not change. I know that if self.canvas.coordsthing[2]canvaswidth will have to change as well.p  pI have seen this asked in different forms but I have not found an answer that does not involve scaling all the widgits on the canvas.

Now, I know Tkinter widgets cant be saved, but I accidently created a widget, and gridded it on the same line, like sop  precodeldronese  Labelframedrones, text  Number of drones.gridrow  3, column  1, columnspan  2 codepre  pThis caused my shelving function to read it as None as opposed to a widget So instead of saying it cant do anything with it, it saved it as None.  Now, when I open said file, it takes my widget variable and sets it to none.  I cant save over it, with .grid on a seperate line, because then it wont be saved.  I cant use del to get rid of the variable, because its in a different file. Actually, I probably can, Im just ignorant as to how to do thatp  pSo my question is how do I remove that pesky ldronese variable from my pickle file so my program will use the new ldronese variable that doesnt have.grid attached to it.p

Positive 5323 pIm trying to create a GUI for a virtual board for the game Go. There should be an codencodexcodencode grid of tiles where a player can place a stone, either black or white. Clicking on a tile will make it change from tanthe default to black, click again to white, and click a third time to go back to tan. Player one can click once on a spot to place a stone there, and player two can click twice you need to remove stones later, so three clicks resets it. I created a tile object and then used a nested for loop to instantiate 9 by 9 of them. Unfortunately, running the code only seems to produce 1 functional tile, not 81. This code should work on any python machine Im using Python 3.4, so you can try to run it and see for yourself. Can anyone point out the reason the loop is only running once p  precodefrom tkinter import  window  Tk n  9   A tile is a point on a game board where black or white pieces can be placed.

Positive 5323 pI am fairly new to programming and am making a program that searches through information about rugby players in a file about 123,300 players and displays the players that match the users search criteria with codetkintercode in Python 3. p  pI have a search button that is binded to a codesearchcode method, which gets the users input, calls runsearch to search the file for matches, and displays the matches to a canvas. It works fine except that the GUI freezes when the button is pressed, and only unfreezes a few seconds later when the search is finished and the matching players info is drawn to the canvas. The actual searching function of the search method is written in a different .py file, playersearchengine.p  pSo far I understand that codetkintercode executes things serially, and so the GUI cannot be redrawn until the coderunsearchcode part is done. I looked around and the solution is to do the search in a different thread, or manually call codeupdatecode on the GUI. The latter was advised against and wouldnt work for me anyway, and most solutions just say to start another thread. I have no idea how to do this, and am not even sure what a thread is except that it might let the code run in parallel. I tried to copy a few examples that used classes for progress bars, but the GUI still froze the same.p  pHere is all the relevant I think codep  precodeimport playersearchengine import tkinter as tk import tkinter.ttk as ttk import threading  class scoutingtooltk.Tk     def initself, parent         tk.Tk.initself, parent         self.root  parent         self.drawsearchpanel         self.drawresultspanel      def drawsearchpanelself         ...      def drawresultspanelself         ...      def drawfoundplayersself         displays a row showing the details of a player for every found player      def searchself, event         gets the input from all the search fields, applies them to the search engine settings,         and searches the database using them.

Positive 5323 pThe type field is the most important part of an event specifier. It specifies the kind of event that we wish to bind, and can be user actions like Button, and Key, or window manager events like Enter, Configure, and others. The modifier and detail fields are used to give additional information, and can in many cases be left out. There are also various ways to simplify the event string for example, to match a keyboard key, you can leave out the angle brackets and just use the key as is.

Ive recently noticed that when a form is loaded, the accelerator key is active even when the user does not press the Alt key.  For example, our Search button uses AltH as the accelerator, but the user can initiate a search by simply pressing H.

Negative 5323 pI have two bitmap images. One contains a picture taken with a usb camera.

Negative 5323 pi have always wondered how to handle Files in applications. Say we have an Object containing several data about a File like a UUID and the reference to the file on disk.p  pEven if this Object is immutable, there might be side effects like the file will be deleted by a part of the application but the other do not know about it, rendering the Object unusable. p  pIs there a handy pattern I can use for such cases Or do I have to doublecheck every time I use the Object that the File reference actually points to an existing file This might be the only solution since the file can be deleted from outside of the application, but may leave the application in hardtohandle situation.p  pThe problem exists the other way around Who is responsible for deletion of the file Since the Object might be an ordinary value object it may be referenced by other parts of the system no part of the code can delete the file for cleanup propourses to avoid sideeffects...p  pBut there might be a pattern or policy that can be used to ease the handling in such cases. p

Negative 5323 pIve got a custom list with a custom content type. Im aware that when you create a new item you can see a drop down for the different content types on that list which I assume all have their own NewForm.aspx somewhere. I can specify in the content type definition which columns are shown on the New form and that I can replace the new form with a custom one of my own design.p  pWhat Im trying to achieve is to have multiple New forms but for the same content type listed on the New drop down. I would like each new form to expose different fields of the content type. Additionally Id like to make particular New forms only visable by users with particular permissions although this isnt critical.p  pemScenario Ive got a content type with all the fields I need for a risk assessment. When a new item is created it only exposes fields to enter contact details. Once this is created a workflow with infopath forms then drives the gathering of the rest of the risk assessment information through booking, the inspection itself and approval of the data. I want the ability to have a second option to easily enter all this information on a different new form for an inspection thats already been done and needs logging in the system.emp

Negative 5323 pCan someone recommend a payment gateway that allows incremental irregularly recurring charges to the same cardp  pIve looked at PayPal  they offer a recurring payment systen, but you can only charge payments on a schedule the same amount at regular intervals, so it doesnt work for me.p  pWhat Im after, is a payment solution without these restrictions  where you can charge the customer repeatedly, without asking for their credit card information again.p  pIn other words, the payment gateway should probably work like PayPal, in the respect that you put in the credit card information once, and you get back a tokenkey, which you can safely store in the sites database, since this token can only be used to transfer money from the associated card to the account for which the tokenkey was originally created.p  pNote that the Direct Payment option offered by for example PayPal does not work me either, because it requires me to either A store credit card data in our database ILLEGAL, or B ask the consumer for their credit card number, CVR and expiration date, every time IMPRACTICAL.p  pIn my own personal opinion, using PayPal checkout andor Google checkout would be a great option  these are brands that people trust, and the checkout process is simple, since you only have to log in and confirm your purchase.p  pBut my client is concerned about looking professional  although I dont personally agree that using thirdparty checkout makes you look unprofessional, the client is also concerned about the fact that users have to leave their site to pay.p  pAny recommendationsp  pOh, and if the payment processors you recommend also had a reasonable fee schedule, that would of course be a big plusp

Since this seems not to work, what do I do insteadp  pMuch appreciated, no matter how inane my questions are you guys are always so helpful.p
Negative 5323 pI am trying to compile an Octave .oct function to calculate the medians of the upper and lower halves of a sorted vector which will vary in length e.g. for an odd length vector such as [5,8,4,6,7] I want the lower median value of 4,5 and 6 and the upper median value of 6,7 and 8 6 is part of both calculations, and for an even length vector such as [5,8,4,6,7,9] I want the lower median value of 4,5 and 6 and the upper median value of 7,8 and 9.

Negative 5323 pstrongProblemstrongp  pWCF requests for my 2 Workflow Services in different Application Pools are not being processed by their respective worker processes. Instead, both worker processes are processing WCF requests for both Workflow Services. This problem only occurs in Integrated Managed Pipeline Mode but not Classic Managed Pipeline Mode.p  pstrongSetupstrongp  ul li2 Worflow Services Workflow Foundation 4.0 running in IIS 7.5. li liEach Workflow Service is setup as an application in IIS and has its own Application Pool, with its own Identity credentials. li liThe Application Pools are running in Integrated Managed Pipeline Mode.li ul  pstrongDescriptionstrongp  pLets just say for example, I have Workflow Service A emWFSAem and B emWFSBem running under emUserAem and emUserBem respectively. They both are expecting WCF calls via Receive activities in the workflow.p  pWhen I start the 2 Application Pools, I can see 2 w3wp.exe worker processes running, one as emUserAem and the other as emUserBem. I expect that w3wp.exe worker process for emUserAem should handle WCF requests for emWFSAem, and w3wp.exe worker process for emUserBem should handle WCF requests for emWFSBem.p  pHowever, when I start sending WCF messages to the workflows, I can see through the trace log files that both w3wp.exe processes are handling requests for both Workflow Services. p  pFor example, WCF messages for emWFSAem are being handle by the w3wp.exe worker processes for emUserAem AND emUserBem. So if I send 10 WCF messages to emWFSAem, 4 would be handled by w3wp.exe for emUserAem, and 6 would be handled by w3wp.exe for emUserBem.p  pWhen I switch the Application Pool to Classic Managed Pipeline Mode, the WCF messages are routed to the respective worker processes, as expected.p  pIs there some configuration that Im missing p  pAny help is greatly appreciated.p  pstrongUpdatestrongp  pIn the project Im working on, emWFSAem, emWFSBem, and another WCF Service Application emWCFAppem communicate with each other in the following configurationp  pemWFSAem lt emWFSBem lt emWCFAppemp  pWe see problems in the following scenariop  ul liemWFSAem  emWFSBem emUserAem emWFSAem instantiates a new workflow on emWFSBem, which is processed on w3wp.exe for emUserAem.li liemWFSBem emUserAem  emWCFAppem emWFSBem calls the emWCFAppem, which does some processing. li liemWCFAppem  emWFSBem emUserBem After processing, emWCFAppem notifies emWFSBem that its done.

Negative 5323 pAs a designer, I like providing interfaces that cater to a powersimplicity balance.  For example, I think the LINQ designers followed that principle because they offered both dotnotation and querynotation.  The first is more powerful, but the second is easier to read and follow.  If you disagree with my assessment of LINQ, please try to see my point anyway  LINQ was just an example, my post is not about LINQ.p  pI call this principle dialable power.  But Id like to know what other people call it.  Certainly some will say KISS is the common term.  But I see KISS as a superset, or a consumerism practice.  Using LINQ as my example again, in my view, a team of programmers who always try to use query notation over dotnotation are practicing KISS.  Thus the LINQ designers practiced dialable power, whereas the LINQ consumers practice KISS. The two make beautiful music together.p  pstrongeditstrong Ill give another example.  Imagine a logging tool that has two signatures allowing two usesp  precodevoid Writestring message void WriteFuncltstringgt messageCallback codepre  pThe purpose of the two signatures is to fulfill these needsp  precodeEveryday simple usage, nothing special. myLogger.WriteSomething Happened  error.ToString   This is performance critical, do not call ToString if logging is disabled. myLogger.Write  gt  Something Happened  error.ToString  codepre  pHaving these overloads represents dialable power, because the consumer has the choice of a simple interface or a powerful interface.  A KISSloving consumer will use the simpler signature most of the time, and will allow the busy looking signature when the power is needed.  This also helps selfdocumentation, because usage of the powerful signature tells the reader that the code is performance critical.  If the logger had only the powerful signature, then there would be no dialable power.p  pSo this comes fullcircle.  Im happy to keep my own dialable power coinage if none yet exists, but I cant help think Im missing an obvious designation for this practice.p  pp.s. Another example that is related, strongbut is not the samestrong as dialable power, is Scott Meyers principle make interfaces easy to use correctly, and hard to use incorrectly. p

Negative 5323 pI am building this app that will develop relationships between the users on the contact list of a phone. I am at the point now where once a user installs this app heshe will be able to send a message to one or more people from the contact list. If a person from the contact list doesnt have my app installed heshe would get a pure text message with a link to view the message, download the app so the messages start coming into the app as opposed to by sms, simple. If they do have it installed i need the sender to be aware of it and push a C2DM notification about a new message. I have all of the app functionality built, the only thing thats left is this relationship piece...p  pI could do this by knowing if a user with this phone number is running my app, then cross reference the number with someone elses contact list... but i need to deal with international numbers, users having or not having 1 in front of their numbers in US, then we have a different form of numbers in Europe and elsewhere... problems grow. For example, i am in US and if i have a friend on my contact list in Europe, his number on my phone would include some country codes, where the number stored on his phone would not. I am running into a problem of verifying users identity. If i go by phone number which guarantees the uniqueness there could be an issue of spoofing it. I could verify the phone number by sending text message from the app to my server, is it safe enough p  pBottom line is i need the app to be aware that one of my contacts have the same app installed without sending invites, acceptance and else. Maybe i am overthinking this, or maybe there is no way to do this...p  pYour thoughts and recommendations are very welcomed and appreciated. p  pThanks and enjoy your weekend p

Its an old paper and Im not sure if the authors conclusions still hold, but he strongly implies that, in order to have lexical rather than dynamic scope, you have to abandon the traditional Cstyle stack, and instead have a tree structure of environments, allocated from the heap.p  pDoes this make it impossible to have lexically scoped closures in any hardrealtime system in realtime embedded systems, where latencies are measured in microseconds, heap allocation is typically forbidden because of the nondeterministic latency it introduces.p  pThis has been an idle curiosity of mine, because I make my bread mostly as a firmware developer where C is the de facto language, and for a while now it seems Ive been using my brain power to figure out how to force C to let me do things that come for free in more sophisticated languages. Consequently, Ive begun to wonder whether you could implement a microlisp compiler specifically for hardrealtime embedded microcontrollerbased systems.p  pAs a side note Ive lately gained great insights into deep topics like how closures and objects are equivalent and so forth, and it gives me greater awe of guys like Stallman and Rich Hickey, and Paul Graham. Implementing Lisp from the ground up seems like a daunting task to me. Its hard to know where to start. Maybe with PGs implementation of McCarthys original eval function, IDK. Anyway, I digress.p

Negative 5323 pIm creating a custom control in C winforms.

Negative 5323 pIs there a way to specifically format a link on my page to tell a mobile device such as an Android phone or an iPhone that when a user clicks a link to a mp4 file for example to go ahead and play it or ask the user if they want to play it using their phone media playerp  pIm working on a web app with mixed results, most of the times the device just goes straight into download mode, and attempts to save the file to the downloads folder, but what I would like is to make it so the device starts automatically playing the file as soon as possible.p  pMy app is basically a file sharing app that creates qr codes and thus allows you to share media to mobile devices... the thing is, when it comes to video files and maybe images, I want the phone to automatically display the media and not just download it.p  pAny help would be greatly appreciated.

Negative 5323 pThis is Rule 2 of 5 rules the book gives about how the browser determines which rule to apply in a conflictp  blockquote   pAn id selector is the second most specific [after inline style attribute]. If there is more than one id in the rule, the rule with greatest number of id selectors wins.p blockquote  pI really dont understand what Rule 2 is talking about  it says if there is more than one id in the strongrulestrong which is singular. If there is only one rule, how is there a conflict or comparisonthe rule with greatest wins How can one rule have a differing number of id selectors, and where is the conflict if there is only one rule p  pCan someone please expain this rule thoroughly Thanks for helping, as I am trying to get the basics of web design downp

Negative 5323 pStoring randomly picked rows in sessionp  pHip  pIm building a PHP script that outputs a random word from a MySQL table. Each time the script is refreshed I want a new word to display. It is connected to jquery  so the data output of the phpfile is directly displayed on my pagep  pHowever, I want to display each word only once. If all the words are picked, I want the script to reset and start picking over again. p  pRight now I have done this by setting up an additional table called visited and putting all the picked rows from table wordlist in there, with the users unique sessionid to  prevent results from multiple users to interfere with eachother.p  pSo the query goes like thisp  precodesessionstart id  sessionid  randomsql  SELECT  FROM wordlist AS a LEFT JOIN visited AS b ON a.word  b.word AND b.sessionid  id WHERE b.word IS NULL ORDER BY a.weight  rand  DESC   Weighted random LIMIT 1   randomrow  mysqlqueryrandomsql  ifmysqlnumrowsrandomrow gt 0  whilerow  mysqlfetchrowrandomrow  insertquery  INSERT INTO visited ID, word, sessionid, date VALUES row[0], row[1], id, CURDATE insert  mysqlqueryinsertquery or die mysqlerror echo row[1]  codepre  pThis works perfectly fine, but I reckon it would be hard for the database to handle many visitors at the same timep  pSo my question isp  pHow can I store the information of visited words in a session and exclude them from the queryp  pOne more thing Im estimating that the wordlisttable will have around 8000 rows. Will this be too many for the ORDER BY RANDfunction, and render out to be noticeably slow p  pThanksp

Negative 5323 pI am receiving periodically location updates via GPS, the problem is the time until the first location update occurs  it is just to long. When the user is within a building, this time gets even worser.p  pTherefore I am looking for some strategies to improve the startup time at the moment I dont use codegetLastKnownLocationcode but I will. I started reading a hrefhttpandroiddevelopers.blogspot.comsearchlabelLocationA Deep Dive Into Locationa to get some ideas and have some thoughts now I would like to discuss with you.p  pAt first the blog post mentioned above goes through each location provider on the device and queries for the codegetLastKnownLocationcode, but only considers them when they are not to old and within an allowed accuracy.p  pHere comes my first question I would expect to have the network based location immediately available, so I would request a new network based location, then I would get codegetLastKnownLocationcode from the GPSprovider and if the last GPSlocation is within the circle formed by the point network based location and radius accuracy then I would take the GPS location, regardless how old it is. What do you thinkp  pAfter checking the last known location I will start the GPS position tracking and because I only need it every 2 seconds and 10m change, I would use codelm.requestLocationUpdatesLocationManager.GPSPROVIDER, 2  1000, 10, thiscodep  pHowever I found a pattern inside the presentation a hrefhttpwww.slideshare.netretomeierbeingepicbestpracticesforbuildingandroidappsBeing Epic Best Practices for Android Developmenta on slide a hrefhttpwww.slideshare.netretomeierbeingepicbestpracticesforbuildingandroidapps9595a and a hrefhttpwww.slideshare.netretomeierbeingepicbestpracticesforbuildingandroidapps9696a that at first he turns on coarse and fine locations with 0,0 for time and distance changes and then, when the first event is received, he switches to the really needed update frequency. So, does the first gpsupdate comes faster when the interval is set to 0p  pIn opposite to this pattern I would keep the coarse update until the first GPS update is received. What do you thinkp  pHope to get some interesting answersp  pUpdatep  pI did some investigations I turned on GPS and waited to get a fix. Then I turned GPS off and drove 50km 31 miles. Then I used the code from a hrefhttpandroiddevelopers.blogspot.comsearchlabelLocationA Deep Dive Into Locationa to get all the codegetLastKnownLocationcode. I tried it twice, first with GPS turned off and second with GPS turned on, but without a fixp  p1 with GPS turned off I gotbr  Provider network, correct location with accuracy 680mbr  Provider passive mProvidernetwork, same location as above, same time as abovebr  Provider gps, location null p  pSo I learned that when gps is turned off you get no codegetLastKnownLocationcode.p  p2 with GPS turned on I gotbr  Provider network, correct location with accuracy 652mbr  Provider passive mProvidernetwork, same location as above, same time as abovebr  Provider gps, location as it was 2h earlier with accuracy 12m, time was also 2h earlierp  pHere I learned that old messages are not invalidated, even it is obvious that they are wrong.p  pIn that case the algorithm works fine, because I moved in the time I turned the GPS off. But what if I enter a house In that case the 2h old GPS result would be very good, even it is outdated.p

Negative 5323 pIm working on an API using Jersey Server. I have a common root element defined in a bean that I currently wrap around the response from the resource another bean using a container response filter. It works great. p  pIt basically returns thisp  precodelttransactiongt    ltstatusgtGoodltstatusgt    ltidgt1ltidgt    .... lttransactiongt codepre  pSo it basically wraps the transaction element and status element around the bean returned from the resource, which is annotated with javax.xml binding annotations.p  pWere looking at implementing the OData format, which provide an Atom style XML, and JSON. Both are in a different format really. So if the media type requested to be returned is applicationxml, the filter works as it does now. If the requested media type is applicationatomxml, it needs to return an atom styled xml document.p  precodeltfeed xlmnshttpwww.w3.org2005Atom       xmlnsmhttpschemas.microsoft.comado200708dataservicesmetadata       xmlnsdhttpschemas.microsoft.comado200708dataservicesgt   lttitlegtresource namelttitlegt   ..... ltfeedgt codepre  pIf the requested media type is applicationJSON it needs to return the JSON format of OData which is something like thisp  precoded     results  [        metadata         uri  httpwww.url.comapiresource      ,     title  reource name,     ....   ]  codepre  pIve found online documentation and examples in regards to setting up providers implementing the MessageBodyWriter. I could have one provider for each type. So the produces annotation would have the apporriate media type and the isWriteable method would also check on the appropriate type. Then the writeTo method could alter the format of the bean returned from the resource, and wrap the correct format around it. But is a unique provider like that really the intent and is that the best way to achieve these three possible returns p  pI was also thinking of just adding to the container response filter class I already have to check the media type being returned and formatting it accordingly that way, but I worry the filter may get to be to big, in that it is doing too much for a filter, not sure if thats really a concern. p  pI could also just handle building the bean up and formatting it accordingly in each resource method, but it would save time to do it once, or three times uniquely, and have that applied to every bean returned.p  pWhich direction is better Is there another option that may be even better than these twop  pThanksp

Negative 5323 pI am working on a an IR problem that can be represented with two keyvalue tables. p  pTable Q  has a fixed size determined at time of insertion, updates to the table increment counters, the size can shift as the data is encoded in protocol buffers and as numerical go higher they may increase the byte size variant int encoding.p  pTable P  contains references to table Q, it is a one to many relationship as one p can point to many qs. Updates increase counters and add references. Lots of fragmentation.p  pTable Q and P are exactly the same in data access characteristics to standard IR full text search structure of inverted indices. Q is documents and P is words  postings.p  pI tried the following embedded databases.p  ol liSQLite normalised form, too slow, not parallel, too much storage overhead. Performs the worst.li liKyotodb . Pseudo transactions global locking performance drops , increasing linearly past 500 k source lines. Tried a few different approaches.li liBerkley db, page locked transactions, in memory. Performance becomes unacceptable past 6 million source lines. Cpus are saturated but I expect deadlocks and spin locking are causing the usage.li liLeveldb I gave up quite quickly, it works under a globe lock IIRC. Perhaps it retains write performance. I didnt let it run that long.li ol  pThis is the case I want optimisedp  ol liStorage  CPU time Predictability.li liultra high insertion rate.li liConsistent but not durable asychronous writes.li liDesigned for parallel inserts.li liNo Erlang, and no java.li ol  pAnd yes I Can fold the data model into a document oriented structure if needed. This will be a must for mongodb I expect since there are no transactions.p  pThis guy seems to know what he is a hrefhttpperfectmarket.comblognotonlynosqlreviewsolutionevaluationguidechart relnofollowtalking abouta, and since he gives mongodb a 3 star in insert performance I am quite tempted. Even though Json seems wasteful to me. I can also switch to SQL server as it is amazing under insert load, but it doesnt scale beyond heavy iron. strongSo, is mongodb the bees knees for my scenario, anyone try hypertable vs mongodb  Other recommendations strongp  pstrongedit  self answerstrong p  pstrongpremise strong p  ol liLarge transaction scopes are the devil.li liFragmentation is the devil.li ol  pTherefore, before moving to a document oriented database or a distributed keyvalue database in general fix your applications data model to better map onto such data models. Distributed databases do not have transactions, and mongo goes as far as an atomic update for a single document  So to use update in the scope of a transaction Q would have to be your document and P would be indexing variant elements within Q. p  pSo, going to switch to a different representation for my data model. I am going to make sure both tables are statically sized for their lifetime using protocol buffers fixed32 instead of int32, furthermore I am going to unpivotuninvert table P and to this end merge most of P into Q. p  pThis will counter the fragmentation issue and also reduce transaction scope, inserts into P can be done outside of transactions. I am going to try out leveldb in anger as well. I have a feeling it will maintain its level of performance throughout the processing, nevermind the fact that it wont parallelise. p

I am testing locally with a sqlite3 database, DJ 3.0.0, and I even added the delayedjobactiverecord gem.p  pI have, for example, tried to run the following method in the backgroundp  precode user  User.find1  user.delay.recordermethod codepre  pWhere this method isp  precode def recordermethod     self.relevantfield 1     update  end codepre  pThis creates a delayed job, and the handler has the appropriate info for the user and the appropriate method name. The script runs the job, thinks it has succeeded and thus deletes the record from the delayedjob table. BUT the user is unchanged the database is unchanged.p  pWhat on earth is going wrong Note that, when I run the same code user.delay.recordermethod from rails console, it works.. and the difference is the handler created by the rails console call isp  precode  rubyobjectDelayedPerformableMethod     object rubyActiveRecordUser     attributes         ... attribute info and rest of file codepre  pWhereas the one created in by the call in a controller action is p  precode  rubystructDelayedPerformableMethod      object rubyActiveRecordUser      attributes  codepre  pNot the difference in line 1 of both things rubyobject vs rubystruct.. the former works and the latter doesnt.

Great tool, but one thing annoys me and I cant figure out how to change it I think the order of options presented when an abbreviation breaks style rules is backward. Our codebase is littered with variable and method names containing XML, ID, etc. ReSharper catches these which I like but instead of offering to change the name as its first option, it uses the add xyz to abbreviations list as the first option.p  pThis ordering drives me nuts because I frequently add an abbreviation that I dont want by accident. Then I have to spend some time clicking through the config menus to remove the abbreviation. When I do catch myself before adding it, I have to hit the down arrow to reach the option I want Im a VimVsVim user, so as a rule I try to avoid use of the arrow keys.p  pSo  does anyone know how I can switch the order of the suggestions, or even disable the add xyz... option entirely Thanksp

Negative 5323 pI use a google maps v3 with marker clusterer v3 to display 1000s of markers.  I also have a sidepanel that lists the titles of each marker.  When a user hovers over a title in the panel I animate the corresponding marker, and I stop animating on mouseout.p  pThis works fine when the marker isnt in a cluster.  I have a problem when the marker is in a cluster.p  pIf the marker is in a cluster I first change the markers map object from null previously set by markerClusterer so to hide the marker once it puts it in a cluster to my map object, and then I animate the marker.  Again, this works.  Its on mouseout that I experience my problem.p  pOn mouseout I set the marker animation to null and then set the markers map object to null.  This does what you would expect hides the marker, but I cant get the marker to show again on any subsequent hover event.  The marker still exists inside the appropriate cluster object, and I can call setMap to set the markers map property, but the marker still wont show up on the map.  Here is the relevant codep  precode        if event.type  mouseover  event.type  mouseenter                      if marker.getMap  marker is in a cluster                 inCluster  true                 marker.setMapmap              else                  inCluster  false                          marker.setAnimationgoogle.maps.Animation.BOUNCE          else              marker.setAnimationnull             if inCluster  true  hide the clusterized marker                 marker.setMapnull                       codepre  pIf I commentout the two setAnimation calls, then the code will work and the marker can be displayed and then hidden as expected just not animated.  Also, when I play around with the console, I can display the marker out of the cluster, then I can animate it, then i can deanimate it, then I can hide it again, overandover.  But, if I call setMapnull before deanimating the marker, then I hit my bug. p  pSo, the problem only exists when animation hasnt stopped prior to calling setMapnull.  Ive tried setting a timer to give the animation a few hundred milliseconds to stop before calling setMap, and this sometimes works, but other times it triggers other, even worse behavior.p  pAny help solving this would be greatly appreciated and eagerly acceptedp

Negative 5323 pI have a large php script that uses both curl and multi curl requests to my own server and other servers. Besides that it does a number of database requests and other operations on my own server. p  pThe script is too large to put here and wont make things easier.p  pI measured the time throughout the whole script. I made a distinction between the time required for operations on my own server and operations on an external server.p  pIt appeared that adding up the elapsed time for all operations on my own server it all together never takes longer than 0.5 seconds. Therefore I expect that my own script is not heavy for my server. The total elapsed time is 25 seconds on average. p  pThe majority of the time 24.5 seconds my server is waiting for responses from external servers. My server does make around 300 curl requests, but a curl request on itself is not heavy.p  pstrongThe problemstrong When I run the script the cpu goes to 95  and the server is nearly not responding for other requests as long as this script is running.p  pThis is an example of a multicurl requestp  precodeltPHP  Multi curl imax20  build the individual requests as above, but do not execute them for i1 iltimax i   ch.i  curlinithttpwww.domain.com ch2  curlinithttpwww.domain.com curlsetoptch.i, CURLOPTRETURNTRANSFER, true curlsetoptch2, CURLOPTRETURNTRANSFER, true endfor   build the multicurl handle, adding both ch mh  curlmultiinit for i1 iltimax i   curlmultiaddhandlemh, ch.i endfor   execute all queries simultaneously, and continue when all are complete running  null do  curlmultiexecmh, running  while running   all of our requests are done, we can now access the results for i1 iltimax i   response.i  curlmultigetcontentch.i endfor response2  curlmultigetcontentch2  for i1 iltimax i   echo response.i  same output as first example endfor gt codepre  phttpd.confp  precode  This is the main Apache HTTP server configuration file.

Negative 5323 pI dont know how to do this part to finally do the decoding. The guide bars are long rectangles so their barlike shape can be presented using shape five descriptors, eccentricity, major and minor axis lengths and area. We should use a descriptor called solidity which is the area divided by the convex hull area to remove some spurious matches. The proper threshold value limits of the different shape descriptors are Tablep  precodeEccentricity E E gt 0.93 Area A A gt 45 Minor axis length Mi 6 lt Mi lt 20 Major axis length Ma 30 lt Ma lt 90 Solidity S S gt 0.19 Orienation difference  65 lt  lt 120 Distance between centroids D 22 lt D lt 55 codepre  p The distance between their centroids must be close enough to each other and the orientation of the bars must be nearly perpendicular nearly because the perspective projection causes distortion. The distance and angle value limits needed for finding true fixed guide bar pairs can also be found in Table. An example end result of fixed bar finding process can be seen in Figure. I should use bwconncomp and regionprops.p  precodefunction fguidebarsfindfguidebarsimpre,fguidebars FINDFGUIDEBARS Finds the potential pairs of fixed guide bars.

Negative 5323 pIve inherited a project that is built in a PHP MVC framework Zend in this case, and is using different modules for the mobile and desktop versions of the site. The project is in early stages so functionality is only about 20 complete and buggy and as you may have guessed there is alot of repeated code.p  pThe desktop and mobile sites will have different layouts, although there are common elements. My instinct tells me separating these into different Zend modules is emnotem the best approach. Im thinking I should refactor the code into a single module, and confine the layout differences to views as much as possible. Also, leveraging responsive design as much as possible and only using separate views where necessary as dictated by my clients requirements. Conceptually I see many advantages to this approach, but being rather new to Zend and mobile design as well, Im wondering if I am going to encounter any Zendspecific headaches if I do this refactor just being a bit paranoid here p  pWhat is considered best practice in general mobile amp desktop codesign Any specific advice about Zend MVCp

Negative 5323 pI started trying to convert a project to use CMake so that I could import the project into QtCreator to  make use of the QtCreator IDE for this straight C code. This worked pretty nicely as far as giving me auto completions, code diving, etc etc. p  pI have had a bit of a time getting CMake to build the code as I expected, mostly because it was the first time I have been using it. I recently discovered that there is a cmakegui that you can point at your source and it will show you the CMake variables and such. What is the proper way to actually use cmakegui within QtCreator When I just manually made my CMakelists.txt files within my project, it was enough to get the project in there. Should I just run Cmakegui using locator and point it to those files Should I keep the same build directory in cmakegui that was created from QtCreator Any tutorial links or guidance apprecaited  didnt find a whole lot googling.p

Negative 5323 pI am currently kidding around on how to model something using Django. The basic situation is that I have an object that should serve as a codechassiscode and provide some codesocketscode. Then there are loads of different codemodulescode that are placed on the codesocketscode of a codechassiscode. I would like to model these different codemodulescode as distinct classes in Django, but use a common class on the database layer, possibly involving some generic fields.p  pSo the database model might look something like thisp  precodeclass Modulemodels.model     name  models.CharFieldmaxlength128      Or is there a better way to annotate a type     type  models.CharFieldmaxlength128      string1  models.CharFieldmaxlength128     string2  models.CharFieldmaxlength128     ...     int1  models.IntegerField   Some kind of engine class that derives from Module  but does nothing else then mapping the generic  fields to something sensible  class Socketmodels.Model     ison  models.ForeignKeyChassis     name  models.CharFieldmaxlength128     type  models.CharFieldmaxlength128  class Connectionmodels.Model     chassis  models.ForeignKeyChassis     module  models.ForeignKeyModule     via  models.ForeignKeySocket  class Chassismodels.Model     name  models.CharFieldmaxlength128     modules models.ManyToManyFieldModule, throughConnection  class Groupmodels.Model     name  models.CharFieldmaxlength128 codepre  pOf course I wouldnt want to spoil my logic with this denormalization.

Negative 5323 pI use a custom online booking system I made in strongPHP with a MySQL databasestrong. Currently, payments are taken when the client attends their booking face to face in cash and I am now implementing strongPaypals IPN and PDTstrong payments setups into the system together for use as a single item paymentPAY NOW option system emso no shopping cartem. The price, dates and user information vary only. p  pAfter months of research into different debates and security isses, I have come to the conclusion that strongthe best way to use the IPN and PDT systems togetherstrong is to do it on a strongfirstcomefirstserve basisstrong with a script for each. Whether the PDT or the IPN script processes, whichever one is first sends the confirmation email and adds the relevant information to the database. If either the PDT or the IPN processes and finds that the other has already processed, it strongonlystrong updates the database information that is missing as an email will already have been sent by the other script.p  pThe booking system made from scratch has been in use for 2 years without problems but now requires online payments instead.p  pWhen a booking is made online, the client enters their details, selects start date, end date, times for their booking and then the information is POSTED form method POST to a PHP script. The script verifies, processes and outputs to a confirmation page that the booking was successful as well as emails the client and the admin email address.p  pemTHE MYSQL DATABASE IS NOT CURRENTLY USED FOR SAVING BOOKING DETAILS.emp  pI now want to do the payments online with the same structure.p  pThe MySQL database has now been amended and has a new table with all the fields possible back from a call back from either an IPN or PDT reply from Paypal, successful or failed, as well as basic information about a booking.p  pThe problems I have are thesep  ul lipThe PDT can be faked. strongHow can this be avoided, as if the email from the PDT script is sent, they will have already received confirmation which will cause problemsstrong emI could avoid this by only sending emails with the IPN script and telling PDT process to only show the booking information back to the client but state a confirmation email will be sent but sometimes the IPN can take a while and the client needs to be reassured immediately that the booking has been confirmed as the booking could be for a booking within the next 30 minutes.empli lipI have attempted to create several PDT and IPN scripts based on the examples on the web with Xcommerce Paypal developers website, Paypal, and many others for almost a month and none seem to work correctly. strongCan anyone please provide a PDT script and a IPN script which both process all variables possible and verify key basic information for the orders such as name, address, zippost code and pricestrong emThis would be useful for anyone trying to create a payment process with IPN and PDT for anyone as all anyone would need to do is remove what isnt needed for each script.empli ul  pemstrongJust as a note,emstrong each script checks if the other has run by checking a the IPN or the PDT field in an MySQL table has a 1 in it. 0 is the default.p  pI look forward to peoples replys as I am sure this will help everyone having problems with either systems, no matter how the scripts are used.p  pstrongThank you to all in advance.strongp  pPlease provide a tested MySQL table also, if different from below, for any answers provided to help others reading the answers.p  pI have created and am using the following tablep  precodeCREATE TABLE bookings  id int 11  NOT NULL AUTOINCREMENT , date1 char 2  NOT NULL default , month1 char 2  NOT NULL default , year1 char 2  NOT NULL default , date2 char 2  NOT NULL default , month2 char 2  NOT NULL default , year2 char 2  NOT NULL default , name text NOT NULL , address text NOT NULL , zippostcode text NOT NULL , email text NOT NULL , price char 2  NOT NULL default , pdt varchar 12  NOT NULL default 0, ipn varchar 12  NOT NULL default 0, paypalstatus varchar 12  NOT NULL default , datebooked varchar 50  NOT NULL default , receiveremail varchar 127  NOT NULL , paymentstatus varchar 25  NOT NULL , pendingreason varchar 25  NOT NULL , paymentdate varchar 100  NOT NULL , mcgross double NOT NULL , mcfee double NOT NULL , tax double NOT NULL , mccurrency varchar 10  NOT NULL , txnid varchar 25  NOT NULL , txntype varchar 25  NOT NULL , firstname varchar 75  NOT NULL , lastname varchar 75  NOT NULL , addressstreet varchar 200  NOT NULL , addresscity varchar 50  NOT NULL , addressstate varchar 40  NOT NULL , addresszip varchar 20  NOT NULL , addresscountry varchar 64  NOT NULL , addressstatus varchar 25  NOT NULL , payeremail varchar 127  NOT NULL , payerstatus varchar 25  NOT NULL , paymenttype varchar 25  NOT NULL , notifyversion varchar 50  NOT NULL , verifysign varchar 255  NOT NULL , addressname varchar 130  NOT NULL , protectioneligibility varchar 50  NOT NULL , ipnstatus varchar 25  NOT NULL , subscrid varchar 25  NOT NULL , reasoncode varchar 25  NOT NULL , contactphone varchar 25  NOT NULL , invoice varchar 127  NOT NULL , forauction tinyint 10  NOT NULL , auctionbuyerid varchar 75  NOT NULL , auctionclosingdate varchar 100  NOT NULL , auctionmultiitem double NOT NULL , addresscountrycode varchar 2  NOT NULL , orderid tinyint 10  NOT NULL , itemname varchar 130  NOT NULL , itemnumber varchar 130  NOT NULL , os0 varchar 200  NOT NULL , on0 varchar 75  NOT NULL , os1 varchar 200  NOT NULL , on1 varchar 75  NOT NULL , quantity double NOT NULL , custom varchar 255  NOT NULL , mchandling double NOT NULL , mcshipping double NOT NULL , creationtimestamp timestamp NOT NULL , PRIMARY KEY  id   TYPE  MYISAM AUTOINCREMENT 1 codepre

Negative 5323 pI am looking to get some ideas on how I can solve my failover problem in my Java service.p  pAt a high level, my service receives 3 separate object streams of data from another service, performs some amalgamating logic and then writes to a datastore.p  pEach object in the stream will have a unique key. Data from the 3 streams can arrive simultaneously, there is no guaranteed ordering.p  pAfter the data arrives, it will be stored in some java.util.concurrent collection, such as a BlockingQueue or a ConcurrentHashMap.p  pThe problem is that this service must support failover, and I am not sure how to resolve this if failover were to take place when data is stored in an inmemory object.p  pOne simple idea I have is the followingp  ol liWrite to a fileelsewhere when receiving an object, and prior to adding to queueli liWhen an object is finally procesed and stored in the datastoreli liWhen failover occurs, ensure that same file is copied across and we know which objects we need to receive data forli ol  pPerformance is a big factor in my service, and as IO is expensive this seems like a crude approach and is quite simplistic.p  pTherefore, I am wondering if there are any libraries etc out there that can solve this problem easilyp

Negative 5323 pWe have some WCF services implemented in an IIS application, communicating over net.tcp on the default port 808, using the Microsoft Net.Tcp Port Sharing Service, throwing an error on production servers.

Also, in the lower level environments, there is a start up delay of probably 30 seconds to a minute, but the result still comes back as expected.p  pIve tried accessing the services over http from INetManager, and I get intermittent failures on all the services  a particular service will return a yellow screen of death on on invocation, then come up with the expected link to the WSDL on the next one seconds later.p  pIm completely at a loss to explain this behavior, or how to resolve it.  Ive googled the error message, and not found anything helpful.  It may be a configuration issue  the production servers are newly provisioned VMs, and we may not have the config exactly right whereas all the lower level environments have been running this and other similar apps for some time, but I have not idea what to look for.  Ive looked at the properties of the app pool that the app is running on and compared it to the lower level environments without finding any differences.p  pIf somebody can point me in the right direction, you would have my undying gratitude.p

Negative 5323 pBy default, the rotation matrix uses the origin point as the center of the rotation.

Negative 5323 pI have a device on the network that is multicasting a very small file via UDP. The iOS app I am developing is responsible for reading these packets and I have chosen to use a hrefhttpsgithub.comrobbiehansonCocoaAsyncSocket relnofollowGCDAsyncUdpSocketa to do so. The file is sent every half second, however I am not receiving it nearly that often only receiving about every 310 seconds. p  pThinking that it may be an issue with the device, I began monitoring the traffic with Wireshark. This appeared to reflect what I was seeing in my app until I enabled Monitor Mode in Wireshark, at which point every UDP packet was being captured. In addition, the iOS simulator began receiving all of the missing packets since it shares the NIC with the Mac I am developing on.p  pIs there a way to enable Monitor Mode on an iOS device or something I am missing that would allow the missing packets to come in I also see that there is a readStream method in GCDAsyncUdpSocket.

Negative 5323 pNewbie questions. While learning ObjectiveC using Xcode 4.5.3 and the book Programming In ObjectiveC 4th edition, I have reached the final chapter in which two iPhone apps are built. Before building the apps I downloaded iOS simulators 4.1, 5.0 and 5.1. p  pWhen I built the first simple iphone app I was able to select iphone 5.0 simulator in the scheme. When I built the second, more complex app I tried to change the scheme which had defaulted to iPhone 6.0 simulator back to iphone 5.0 simulator only to find that that no simulator below 6.0 is available in the drop down any longer.p  pHaving shrugged my shoulders and allowed the launch of my app in the 6.0 simulator I found that one row of the buttons do not display properly in the simulator. This row appears on top of another row with their labels blank or .

Negative 5323 pIm currently working on 3d positional audio in my 3d XNA game using SoundEffectInstance, however Im having troubles finding the correct values of the position of the emitter and listers.p  pI started out setting the position of my listener to the camera positionits a first person game, and the position of the various emitters to the position of the object that was emitting the sound. Doing this muted the sound completely, compared to before I used the Apply3D method.p  pI did some experimenting with the values, and figured after I made the values of the positions much much smaller, I started hearing the sound. My map size has values from 0 to 5000 in the xz plane only moving between 0 and 500 on y axis, so the distance between the listener and emitter will generally be high when comparing to the values I needed to hear anything at all which was between 0 and 1. p  pIs there any way to control what close and far away is for the soundEffectInstance Or am I supposed to normalize the distance values I read trough several guides on 3D sound, but I have not seen anything related to normalizing or control of the distance values. p

Negative 5323 pIve just ended the development of a web application that needs to be run on local school networks. The application is written in ASP.NET using the MVC 4 framework. The database it uses is a local database file that has to be copied and run on the local server. p  pThe application consists of a school management system, to be deployed on a local server in many primary and secondary schools in a developing country, where the IT staff is not that skilled with IT and a difficult setup procedure might be form turn out to be a problem. To make this deployment easy I thought of creating an msi package that also contains a configured version of SQL server express that runs the DB and an IIS server. I could also make a manual on how to install all of these things but the msi or another prepackaged deploy should make it easier for the IT staff to deploy.p  pIs it possible to do this and if so, what should be the best msipackaging program I can use to capture these changes Are there any other approaches that I should consider and that would be possible Are there any other approaches that might be easier or better than the one i intend on usingp

Negative 5323 pi have an issue with webkit browsers safari and chrome. when i zoom out, i have a line of text set at 41px, and another font set at about 12px. when i zoom out to around 33 and 25, the font set at 12px doesnt get smaller. in fact it is almost the same size as the 41 px text, so because of this when i zoom out in webkit, the text that doesnt get smaller overflows their container, and spills out, pushing other text out of their container and so on.  this only happens in webkit browsers, it works perfect in firefox, ie, and opera.p  pi have looked over the internet to find anything but i only found one website talking about the fontsize threshold in google chrome a hrefhttpdropshado.wspost12971305087webkitzoomedoutfontsizethreshold relnofollowhttpdropshado.wspost12971305087webkitzoomedoutfontsizethresholdap  pi couldnt find a bugzilla bug that was specific to this problem. the only solution i found was to specify overflow hidden on the divs containing overflowing text, and it looks fine, but the font is still not scaled right, and is just cut off. anyone else experience thisp

Negative 5323 pWhat Im trying to achieve is to handle some complex key press and release sequence with Rx. I have some little experience with Rx, but its clearly not enough for my current undertaking, so Im here for some help.p  pMy WinForms app is running in the background, only visible in a system tray. By a given key sequence I want to activate one of its forms. Btw, to hook up to the global key presses Im using a nice library a hrefhttpglobalmousekeyhook.codeplex.com relnofollowhttpglobalmousekeyhook.codeplex.coma Im able to receive every key down and key up events, and while key is down multiple KeyDown events are produced with a standard keyboard repeat rate.p  pOne of example key sequence I want to capture is a quick double Ctrl  Insert key presses like holding Ctrl key and pressing Insert twice in a given period of time. Here is what I have currently in my codep  precodevar keyDownSeq  Observable.FromEventPatternltKeyEventArgsgtmKeyboardHookManager, KeyDown var keyUpSeq  Observable.FromEventPatternltKeyEventArgsgtmKeyboardHookManager, KeyUp  var ctrlDown  keyDownSeq.Whereev gt ev.EventArgs.KeyCode  Keys.LControlKey.Select gt true var ctrlUp  keyUpSeq.Whereev gt ev.EventArgs.KeyCode  Keys.LControlKey.Select gt false codepre  pBut then Im stuck. My idea is that I need somehow to keep track of if the Ctrl key is down. One way is to create some global variable for that, and update it in some Merge listenerp  precodeObservable.MergectrlDown, ctrlUp                     .Dob gt globablbool  b     .Subscribe codepre  pBut I think it ruins the whole Rx approach. Any ideas on how to achieve that while staying in Rx paradigmp  pThen while the Ctrl is down I need to capture two Insert presses within a given time. I was thinking about using the Bufferp  precodevar insertUp  keyUpSeq.Whereev gt ev.EventArgs.KeyCode  Keys.Insert insertUp.BufferTimeSpan.FromSeconds1, 2     .Dobuffer gt  if buffer.Count  2 Debug.WriteLinehappened      .Subscribe codepre  pHowever Im not sure if its most efficient way, because Buffer will produce events every one second, even if there was no any key pressed. Is there a better way And I also need to combine that with Ctrl down somehow.p  pSo once again, I need to keep track of double Insert press while Ctrl is down. Am I going in the right directionp  pP.S. another possible approach is to subscribe to Insert observable only while Ctrl is down. Not sure how to achieve that though. Maybe some ideas on this as wellp  pstrongEDITstrong Another problem Ive found is that Buffer doesnt suit my needs exactly. The problem comes from the fact that Buffer produces samples every two seconds, and if my first press belongs to the first buffer, and second to the next one, then nothing happens. How to overcome thatp

The AppEngine service also requires a unique ID per record. The resources in the service are shared between multiple clients, so their IDs need to be maintained unique on the server. The resource ID is generated, derived from two other IDs, and in the form of a String.p  pBy design, these resources are never created locally on the Android app, they are only read and updated  creation and deletion happens elsewhere, and then those created are sent via Google Cloud Messaging, complete with their REST Ids, and inserted into the SQLite table. If I ever do create them locally, Ill be able to generate the unique ID from the REST resource locally as well.p  pShould I have the ID on the SQLite database be a separate unique id, maintained locally, and store the REST id in the record, or should I set the SQLite ID to be the same as the REST idp  piep  pMy REST Resources are of the formp  precodeString id  unique, derived from two other ids String data codepre  pMy SQLite options arep  precodecreate table myResource    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMEMT,   restId TEXT,   data TEXT codepre  pOrp  precodecreate table myResource    id TEXT PRIMARY KEY,   data TEXT codepre  pIn the first option, I could make restId UNIQUE as well. Im leaning towards the second option, but am wondering if Ill run into unforeseen problems with this approach.p  pI also have another similar situation with some different resources where the REST key is a Long rather than a String, but I still question whether I should maintain a local primary key separate to the REST resource ID.p

Negative 5323 pIs there a script or a tool to generate the config.pri file for a BB10 project Momentics IDE does it for you automatically whenever a project is refreshed or the directory is changed. Unfortunately, I am deploying and compiling via command line tools it is an automated script which runs tests.p  pWithout the config.pri file, I cant make. An easy solution would be to track the file on github along with the source code for the project, but since the file has a timestamp on it, it causes many annoying merge conflicts. p  pAny ideas I rather not write the script myself to parse through all the directories and accumulate header and source files myself. Since Momentics IDE does it, there must be a script that it calls or uses. Momentics is based off of Eclipse, is there any way to see what commands the IDE is callingp

Negative 5323 pIve gotten IAB v3 working and I was able to make a purchase for a managed item. However, to continue developing and testing I wanted to refund the purchase so I could try making the same purchase again. I logged into my Google Checkout Merchant account and successfully refunded the purchase. However, the app still thinks that the user has the item purchased. It has already been several weeks since I made the refund so its not a delay issue. p  pBasically, in my codeQueryInventoryFinishedListenercode implementation, codeinventory.hasPurchaseSKUREMOVEADScode always returns true, even after the refund codeSKUREMOVEADScode is the SKU for item Im selling. I was expecting it to return false after the refund had been processed.p  pIf you look at the a hrefhttpdeveloper.android.comgoogleplaybillingbillingadmin.htmlbillingrefundsHandling Refunds section of the IAB referencea, it says that your app needs to be listening to the INAPPNOTIFY messages. However the a hrefhttpdeveloper.android.comgoogleplaybillingv2api.htmlbillingactionnotifydocumentation for INAPPNOTIFYa is specific to v2 of inapp billing. It doesnt seem to be something thats available in v3 since its not mentioned anywhere in the v3 reference nor can I find any reference for it in the a hrefhttpsgithub.comobriandandroidiabv3trivialdrivesample TrivialDrive appa that they are using to demonstrate IAB v3.p  pSo does v3 of IAB support refundscancelling purchases Has any one tried it and got it workingp

Negative 5323 pIm doing an app which takes a photo with the camera and then rotates it and scales it. I need to rotate the image because the camera returns a wrong rotated image and I need to scale it to reduce its size. I first save in a temp directory the original image returned by camera, then I read it and make modifications, saving the new image to a new file. I tried using matrix to rotate and scale the picture, but it loses quality.  Then I tried to scale it first with Bitmap.createScaledBitmap and then rotate it with matrix, but the result is even uglier than the one using only matrix. Then I tried to rotate it first and then resize it using always Bitmap.createScaledBitmap. The image doesnt lose quality, but its stretched as I scaled it after rotating it and width and height are inverted. Tried also to invert height and width according to the rotation made, but it loses quality again.

Negative 5323 pLets say I have two entities, codeAcode and codeBcode. My goal is to implement the search by all properties of codeAcode and just one property of codeBcode, and to display sum of search results in one codetableViewcode. Naturally I can set codefetchRequestcode only by one entity. But if I am understand right I can fetch not only from codeAcode but from codeBcode too if they are connected with relationships. So what do I need to do to implement this Does default fetch fetches all properties from codeAcode and codeBcode If not, how can I specify fetch of all properties from codeAcode and one property of codeBcode in one fetchp

The test is to determine whether its possible for each item to be assigned to a emsingleem category, among the ones it already belongs to, such that each category ends up with at least some number of items. p  pSo for example, we may require that A, B, and C can each claim strongonestrong item. If were given all 4 dots below, showing that this is possible is easy just stick all the items in a list, loop through the categories, and have each category remove an item that it has access too, and as long as each category is able to remove one item, we pass the test. p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comWUX6r.png altVenn diagram, with three circles and colored dots in the overlapping sectionsp  pNow suppose we remove the blue dot and repeat the test. Clearly we can assign yellow to A, red to B, and green to C, and again we pass. But its hard to codify this solution if we follow the previous method again no blue dot, then suppose A starts by removing the green dot. Now if B removes the yellow dot, well fail the test since C cant remove the red dot, whereas if B removes the emredem dot, C can still take yellow and pass. p  pOne could solve this by brute force by iterating through every possible assignment of items to categories, checking to see if the condition is met with each iteration, but this wont scale well to arbitrary numbers of items and categories, and I have a feeling theres a smarter or more efficient way. p  pI dont know the name of this problem, which makes it hard to research. Does it have an optimal solution If so, what kind of complexity can I expect for the solution p

Negative 5323 pIm building a GUI in wxFormBuilder and writing the code for it in Python.p  pIve noticed that all the widgets Ive built are assigned to codeselfcode in the generated code.

Negative 5323 pI have rewritten part of my code from very simple c arrays to using or trying to use objects in order to get more structure into it.

That means passing the pointers to the arrays directly. Now I access the arrays by the singleton call SingletonClass gV.... It works very fine except the fact that it is much slower than before. The profiler tells me that my program spends 41 of the time with objcmsgSend which I have not had before. p  pFrom reading through the posts I have understood that this probably can happen when msgSend is called very often. This is then most likely the case here, because my program needs a lot of number crunching in order to display an animated flow with OpenGl. p  pThis leads me to my question What would you suggest Should I stay with my simple C implementation or is there a rather simple way to accelerate the objective c version Please be patient with me since I am new to objective c programming.p  pAny hints and recommendations are greatly appreciated Thanks in advance.p

Negative 5323 pWe are maintaining a large website based on Lotus Notes, running on Domino Server 8.5.3. Recently we have been fed up with the lack of source control in our project, so we thought we would try to Git things up a little. But how to do this rightp  pFor various reasons that I will not get into here, we cannot run our applications locally on the development PCs. We can only run them on the development, staging and production servers. Local Domino server running on the development PCs is not an option, unfortunately.p  pThis figure illustrates the current situationp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comBDj4r.png altCurrent situation. Oh, the horror...p  pIn production and staging there are multiple web sites that all have the same functionality. They are basically the same site with the same design, but with different content. Each site consists of a number of Notes databases News, Archive, Discussion etc. The design of these databases is the same for all sites, so they all inherit their design from the same set of master templates NewsTemplate, ArchiveTemplate, DiscussionTemplate etc.p  pA set of replicas of the master templates resides on the Development server. When we deploy new functionality, the required code changes are added to the templates on the Dev. server more details on this below. Then these templates are replicated to the Staging server for testing, and finally to the production server. This part works quite well.p  pThe problems may be found in the lower part of the figure. We are currently two developers, and we both work in the same set of dev. databases News, Archive, Discussion etc on the dev. server. Naturally we keep tripping over each others work, which is quite frustrating. When it is time to deploy, the code that is to be deployed is selectively copiedpasted from the set of dev. databases to the dev. templates. This is done manually, and thus the risk of mistakes is high. We cannot simply replace the design of the templates with that of the dev. databases, because the dev. databases at all times contain code that is under development. So we must take great care to only deploy code that is finished. Also, we have no history of changes. This is a horrible, horrible, horrible add as many horribles as you see fit way to do software development, and we know it.p  pNow, using Git, local replicas, database copies or whatnot, what would be the best way to achieve a more streamlined development and deployment schemep

Negative 5323 pI am writing a program in C that reads a file. Each line of the file is a string of characters to which a computation will be done. The result of the computation on a particular string may imply that strings latter on in the file do not need any computations done to them. Also if the reverse of the string comes in alphabetical order before the current, nonreversed string then it does not need to be checked.p  pMy question is would it be better to put each string in a linked list and delete each node after finding particular strings dont need to be checked or using an array and checking the last few characters of a string and if it is alphabetically after the string in the previous element skip it Either way the list or array only needs to be iterated through once.p

Negative 5323 pFrom what I can tell, due to the nature of the event loop in Node.js there is no way to easily stop a request from being processed after it has already been handed off to the callback function.p  pSince each event callback is not tied to any other specific process flow or event, once a callback is added to the event loops queue or is currently being processed, it will continue to be processed even if the request.ontimeout handler is triggered.p  pIs there any way to stop processing a request if it times out The only way I can think of to partially solve this problem is to add a check at the top of each async callback that is executed during a request to see if the request has timed out and, if it has, then just return immediately and stop the successive callbacks.p  pHowever, this doesnt solve the issue if there is already an outstanding asynchronous call being processed that was made from the timedout request. In that case, unless you destroy the connection to whatever is doing the async processing e.g. executing a MySQL query it will continue and eventually call the async callback associated with it.p  pThis is not an issue in other programming paradigms like PHP  Apache since apache creates a new PHP process for each incoming request, so if the request times out the process is eventually killed and the entire execution flow is stopped.p  pHas anyone run into this issue and found an existing library or custom way to easily solve thisp  pEDIT To add a specific examplep  pRight now we have an API built in node that processes incoming requests to track analytics, publishes the request data to a rabbit queue, then returns a response. If the request comes in and for some reason the request takes longer than 30 seconds to process, it will time out and an error response will be sent to the client. At this point the client will try to make the same call again so we dont lose analytics.p  pHowever, since theres no connection between the request itself and the call to publish to rabbit except the fact that it was that request that initiated the publish theres no way to stop the publishing of that data. Therefore, if the rabbit server eventually finishes processing the publish request there will now be duplicate data, since the client has now made 2 or more requests.p  pThe only way to stop the initial request from completing the publish is to destroy the rabbit connection when the request times out. That way the initial publish is stopped and the retry request from the client will not duplicate it. However, this same type of manual destroying of a connection would need to be done for any async call that is made throughout the request. If I have 5 outstanding async calls when the timeout happens Ill need to destroy all 5 async connections whether they be connections to rabbit, mysql, mongo, etc..p  pThe problem, however, goes beyond connections that have already been established when the request times out. Even if the request times out before the publish to rabbit was initiated, the function that was called to handle that request has already been executed and will not stop unless there is some check at various locations to check if the request has timed out and to return immediately.p

Negative 5323 pI am creating a pdf where the title of each pdf page would be customized based on the current page number. For example, in the 1st page the title is First Page, and in the 2nd page the title is Second Page, and so on...p  pWhat we do now is we add the title to a PdfPTable, then we add a lot of other stuff to the PdfPTable as well, so this PdfPTable contains several pages of data. Finally we add this large PdfPTable object to document.

Im adapting this project from some code I found that was written for an iOS project in a circa2011 version of XCode. I cannot find what I am doing differently.p

Negative 5323 pThis is my first question and I feel like a fool not being able to find the answer since I strongly suspect something like this has already been answered, but my googlefu has failed me. p  pWhat I want to achieve is making a framework that I can add to my applications so I am able to access structs from every class I build. For example, CGRect can be accessed from any class that I build because I think every class includes the Foundation Framework, or when I create a view controller I am able to use UIButtons because they are located in the UIKit Framework, which subsequently pulls the Foundation Framework and the CoreGraphics Framework. p  pI want a file where I can stick structs or custom objects that Ill be interested in using over and over again. i.e. CGPoint from the CoreGraphics Frameworkp  precodestruct CGPoint    CGFloat x   CGFloat y  typedef struct CGPoint CGPoint codepre  pId want a Framework where I could add stuff like a month typedefp  precodetypedef enum      Jan  1,     Feb  2,     Mar  3,     Apr  4,     May  5,     Jun  6,     Jul  7,     Aug  8,     Sep  9,     Oct  10,     Nov  11,     Dec  12,  SSMonth codepre  pI think in C the way Id accomplish this is by creating a header file and just including this header file in all of the other files which use the the above SSMonth example. Would it be better to achieve this goal a similar way for an iOS project, or would creating a Framework be the better method Assuming I wanted to expand it beyond structs and typedefs and wanted to include actual classes would the answer be the same p

Negative 5323 pIn encapsulation the idea is that you hide what your class is doing with its variables by declaring them private, which achieves the OCP. But then why would you then add getters and setters, which then opens up your variables for modificationp  pWhy go through the whole trouble of setting your variables as private, to then add a public setter on them That doesnt seem very restrictive, which is one of the ideas of encapsulation.p

Negative 5323 pReading about interrupts in linux, I understand that their handlers will run till completion lets not consider the bottom halves here. So, assume that my code has codeSIGINTcode handler registered using the codesignalsigactioncode call with a codewhile1codeloop in it i.e the handler never returns.p  pIf I quit my program abruptly while running, then shouldnt this scenario freeze my machine entirely Wont my machine with only one CPU core go into an infinite loopp  pWhat I mean is since my interrupt handler is not returning, wont the CPU be stuck in executing the while1 code only i.e no other process will get the chance of running, because there wont be any contextswitchpreemption inside the handler or can the interrupt handler get preempted in between running the while1 loopp

Negative 5323 pWhen coderequest.referercode doesnt return anything, does that always mean that the visitor didnt do the request through a link  i.e. she somehow manually entered the requested pages addressp  pOr are there other cases where coderequest.referercode returns codenilcode granted that the request is successfulp
Negative 5323 pIm developing an Android Kitkat Application using the OpenCV Android SDK project. But there is no document about using the OpenCV Android SDK in Android Studio. How do I do itp
Negative 5323 pI have a question and try searching on Google and Stakoverflow and couldt find any perfect solution. I am using phpmailer and want to let the user to customize its body message. So I have given and option to edit the email body text by providing a texarea input box in back end where user will input the email text with some my own provided php variable. p  pFor example body text is Dear username, thank you for signup.. Once I store this input into database and want to retrieve this in phpp  precodeusername  ABC username variable message  row[message] stored email body message echo message codepre  pOUTPUT DATA Dear username, thank you for signup.p  pI want to get it like this Dear ABC, thank you for signup..

Negative 5323 pI have been trying to understand why sometimes IE8 doesnt like PreventDefault and why sometimes it seems to be OK no errors. From what I have read, including here at SO is that events in jquery are normalised so preventDefault will always exist with a jQuery event. However regular javascript event bindings is when the following workaround is needed for ie8p  precodeevent.preventDefault  event.preventDefault  event.returnValue  false codepre  pIs this correctp  pSo if you are using jQuery .click .bind .on etc to handle an event then PreventDefault will not cause errors in IE8, such asp  precodea.onclick, functione      e.preventDefault    no need for e.preventDefault  e.preventDefault  e.returnValue  false as jquery event     code  codepre  pHowever if it is a regular Javascript event, such onclick then the workaround is neededp  pHope that makes sense.p  pThanksp

Negative 5323 pIt would seem that there is an option to provide a title and a titleCondensed for an ActionBar item in the menu xml file.  However, is there an additional way to signify that if there is not enough room to write a menu items text, that it would fade off much like you can do within other views.  This only seems to occur with one language at that due to the longer wording.p  pAt the moment it pushes an entire icon offscreen within portrait mode instead of clipping the text as I would have expected.

Negative 5323 pI have a managed core data object with a codeinitializecode method. If it matters, I am looking to use that method to initialize a static variable that is expensive to to set up. While testing that initialization code I was surprised to discover that the codeinitializecode method is getting called twice.p  pThe first time codeinitializecode is being called codeselfcode is defined as codeClass MyClasscode, as I would expect. p  pThe second time codeinitializecode is being called codeselfcode is defined as codeClass MyClassMyClasscode, which leads me to suspect some sort of unusual initialization for Core Data managed objects.p  pWhile this doesnt pose a problem for me I can just test to see if the static variable has already been initialized, which I would do anyway, to handle ubclassing, it makes me suspect that Core Data is doing something in the object or class lifecycle that I dont understand. Can someone explain to me what is going on in this codeMyClassMyClasscode codeinitializecode method invocationp

Negative 5323 pI have a rooted Sony reader PRS900, running an OEM linux kernel 2.6.23, and I can run arbitrary bashsh scripts from the SD memory card drive on it. I want to compile and execute C programs ... but am having dynamic linker problems.p  pI first tried loading gcc for arm slackware 14s on the SD card, but even when using LDLIBRARYPATH, the sony will fail to find most newer elf .so libraries, although newer programs which use old libraries do in fact run properly.  I can run slackware14s readelf just fine. but not ar, or gcc...  If I try to upgrade libldlinux.so.3, I get a kernel too old error message.p  pI then tried an old slackware 10 version of gcc, and although that solves the elf library finding problem  I then get an illegal instruction error when running programs.p  pSo  I need to make a gcc cross compiler on my x86 for the proper ARM processor and then use it to recompile gcc for the sony.  But I dont know what legacy version of binutils I must use since it assembles and links to ELF format that either works or breaks on the sony.p  pThe Sony is running an arm6 compatible MX31 EBX5016 processor. and some relevant OEM file names on the sony arep  precodelibld2.5.so libldlinux.so.3 gt ld2.5.s  liblibc2.5.so liblibgccs.so.1 codepre  pI know, from the kernel, that gcc4.2.0 was used. I would prefer to use the newest version of gcc which will work with whatever legacy binutils package I need to install.p  pHow do I figure out which version of binutils that I need, and what options I have for gcc Thanksp

Negative 5323 pIm working on a Django site that allows connecting to devices in restricted networks through a cloud service. The devices connect to a cloud server through a VPN or SSH tunnel and clients connect to a virtual host via HTTP. The Django part is required for managing complex organizationroleaccessuser relationships.p  pCurrently Im doing access control in a custom Django middleware module that parses HTTPHOST, does authentication, gets the page and forwards it to the original requester.

Negative 5323 pI have a table with about 40,000 rows. Each has a spaceseparated list of numbers which range from 1 through 100. An example row has a unique identifying name in a column followed by, for example, 4 8 18 32 in another column.p  pI want to combine a free text search of the name with counts for the number of rows containing a certain number. So, for example, give me counts of how many rows match word and also each number 1 through 100. Thats one hundred queries. If the above 4 8 18 32 was the only match in the table, then the counts would be 1 0, 2 0, 3 0, 4 1, ... 8 1, ... 32 1.p  pCurrently, Im trying to use an InnoDB FULLTEXT index with a minimum token length of 1 to do this, and then doing the search in binary mode. My queries look like thisp  precodeSELECT COUNT FROM table WHERE MATCH numbers AGAINST 34 IN BOOLEAN MODE AND name LIKE word as 34, SELECT COUNT FROM table WHERE MATCH numbers AGAINST 35 IN BOOLEAN MODE AND name LIKE word as 35, codepre  pAnd are joined into one result as such. This takes about two or three seconds, which is a very long time.p  pI tried using a temporary table for the LIKE match and then do just the boolean mode searches for numbers against that, but I cannot reuse a temporary table reference more than once in a query, and its reused a hundred times here. I also tried creating a view of the LIKE portion, but did not see much speedup. Telling the view to use algorithmtemptable was not possible, since the fulltext index cannot transfer over.p  pAm I using the database in a fundamentally incorrect way Is there a strategy that can make this significantly fasterp

So that they can run the script against the webpage on a click of a link.p  pThe problem is a new group of users want to begin using the as well script but have requested a solution for IE. Is there a similar way to run a script in IE  I know they can enter the script in the Development Tools and run it from there but, I was hoping for a solution where they wouldnt have to manually load the script for each webpage. p

Negative 5323 pI have a website that I host on a Linux VPS which has been growing over the years. One of its primary functions is to store imagesphotos and these image files are typically around 2040kB each. The way the site is organised at the moment is all images are stored in a root folder photos and under that root folder are many subfolders determined by a random filename. For example, one image could have a file name abcdef1234.jpg and that would be stored in the folder photosabcdef. The advantage of this is that there are no directories with excessive numbers of images in them and accessing files is quick. However, the entire photos directory is huge and is set to grow. I currently have almost half a million photos in tens of thousands of subfolders and whilst the system works fine, it is fairly cumbersome to back up. I need advice on what I could do to make life easier for backups. At the moment, I am backing up the entire photos directory each time and I do that by compressing the folder and downloading it. It takes a while and puts some strain on the server. I do this because every FTP client I use takes ages to sift through all the files and find the most recent ones by date. Also, I would like to be able to restore the entire photo set quickly in the event of a catastrophic webserver failure so even if I could back up the data recursively, how cumbersome would it be to have to upload each back stage by stagep  pDoes anyone have any suggestions perhaps from experience I am not a webserver administrator and my experience of Linux is very limited.

Negative 5323 pIm working on an ecommerce website which has a booking process composed by multiple steps, and I need to run some php code when the user leaves from the booking process  so closes the browser from any of the steps, or clicks back multiple times, until he leaves the step1 , I tried using the js unloadbeforeunload events, something likep  precode var executeAjax  function evt    jQuery.ajax    url myphpurl,    async false     window.beforeunload  executeAjax  window.unloadexecuteAjax codepre  pBut the problem is that this code gets executed when the user passes from step1step2step3 etc... and also when he refreshes the browser, or click backforward, but I only need that code to be ran when he leaves the booking process  so the next url he accesses is not step1,step2, it can be external URLs also, not only my website.... or he closes the browser and I tried several possibilities and none worked.p  pDoes anyone has an idea of how to solve this, I would be grateful.

Negative 5323 pI am trying to find a horizontally scaling solution to the problem described in the title.p  pA more detailed explanation of the problem would be from a message queue web service, read a message containing a URL to a file uploaded somewhere, download the file, parse it, and append its contents to a file whose location is dependent on the contents.p  pBecause of the high volume of messages coming in the queue assume 100 messages per second continuously, if performing concurrent processing by multiple workers, there is a possibility that data may get lost if there is no controlled access to the files.p  pA particular information that is relevant is that within a batch of messages, it is unlikely that two messages would be for the same destination file assume this would occur for 1 of the messages, with even distribution, and the speed to process a message and its file is slightly above the speed to read the message from the queue, lowering the probability of a collision by quite a bit.p  pLosing some data may be acceptable if its a really low probability, but I dont have an exact number.p  pWhat are the available algorithms or design patterns for thisp  pemSome specificsemp  ul li10 million distinct output filesli li5 million messages a dayli lifile storage is provided by a thirdparty webservice with unlimited concurrent readwritesli limessage order has no importanceli lia message only contains a URL to a file with GUID as its nameli ul

Negative 5323 pWhat is necessary to get classes provided via custom classpath container visible in the code completionp  pI have successfully implemented a custom classpath container, that adds libraries to a project. It adds all jars in a specific folder to the build path unless there is a project with the same name in the workspace, in that case the project is referenced.p  pNow this obviously seems to work, when I refer to a class from one of those jars, the code compiles, but I do not see the class in the code completion suggestions. When I have the correct project in my workspace, then I see such a class in the code completion.p  pI have done the following steps to reach this, while I was partly considering a a hrefhttpswww.ibm.comdeveloperworksopensourcetutorialsoseclipseclasspathtutorial from IBMap  ul liImplement ClasspathContainerInitializerli liImplement ClasspathContainerPreferencePage for additional configurationli liImplement IClasspathContainerli ul  pWhen I have added the container to a project I see the jars in the packages explorer as I expected it. Jar there only if no corresponding project is available, Logging shows expected resultsp  pI can use classes from jars integrated via classpath container without compiler errors, they are just not available for code completion and in Quick Fixes to add the right import. So I guess I maybe just miss contributing to some extension point.p

Negative 5323 pIm working on a project where I will be running potentially malicious code. Its basic organization is that there is a master and a slave process. The slave process runs the potentially malicious code, and has seccomp enabled.p  precodeimport prctl  prctl.setseccompTrue codepre  pThis is how seccomp is turned on. I can communicate fine FROM the slave TO the master, but not the other way around. When I dont turn on seccomp, I can usep  precodeimport sys  lines  sys.stdin.read codepre  pOr something along those lines.

Negative 5323 pIm currently trying to learn openGL and Im sort of stuck making a very easy lighting engine for my application. Its 2D and most sources I find only cover rather complicated 3D operations. What I want to do is something as simple as what is covered in this tutorial a hrefhttpwww.alcovegames.comopengles2tutorialslightmapshaderfireeffectglsl relnofollowhttpwww.alcovegames.comopengles2tutorialslightmapshaderfireeffectglslap  pIt nudged me in the right direction and I am to understand that Im to use a framebuffer with sort of a light map that I send to my shaders along with the texture Im rendering so I can combine these values to create a lighting effect. First things first I cant get my framebuffer to workp  pI followed the following tutorial a hrefhttpopen.glframebuffers relnofollowhttpopen.glframebuffersa which was neat enough. It lead me to the following code for very simply creating a framebufferp  precodeGLuint frameBuffer glGenFramebuffers1, ampframeBuffer  glBindFramebufferGLFRAMEBUFFER, frameBuffer glFramebufferTexture2D GLFRAMEBUFFER, GLCOLORATTACHMENT0, GLTEXTURE2D, myTexture2.textureid, 0 codepre  phere myTexture2 is my texture class and the textureid is the GLuint for this texture. I can render this to the screen easily enough using the default frame buffer and it displays fine so I know this works. After I do this, I run the test to check if everything is fine as the tutorial mentionsp  precode    GLenum checkframebuffer  glCheckFramebufferStatusframeBuffer     if checkframebuffer  GLFRAMEBUFFERCOMPLETE              stdcout ltlt Everything is finen          else         stdcout ltlt glCheckFramebufferStatus returned  ltlt glCheckFramebufferStatusframeBuffer ltlt stdendl         stdcout ltlt GlError  ltlt glGetError ltlt stdendl      codepre  pglCheckFramebufferStatus returns 0, with the GLerror 1280 invalid enum. p  pNonsurprisingly, if I bind to this framebuffer before drawing, everything is just black with the glClearColor set to red, so at the very least if it was working it should be red. If I set it back top  precodeglBindFramebufferGLFRAMEBUFFER, 0 codepre  pThen everything runs fine. What is wrong with my framebuffer Ive been searching everywhere for a simple project example that I could just copypaste and run to see that it works but its either the wrong language or uses some library Im not intending to. Furthermore, Im not entirely certain Im understanding how the framebuffer works. Im understanding that its just another screen to draw to or as I understand, adding another step in the rendering process. p  pCurrently Im drawing everything by binding a texture, drawing a quad with the texture size, then moving on to the next texture. This means that for every single image in my application, they all run one shader each or should I say, copies of the exact same shader currently. Am I to understand that if I have for example 20 different images running 20 shaders on screen first, I can then run these through an extra step to mix them with the light map I create in the framebuffer, or am I mistakenp  pSorry if these questions sound dumb, but Ive been browsing through tons of tutorials right now and each one is raising more questions than it seems to answer, I generally learn best by experimenting but when I cant even get my framebuffer going, Im sort of stuckp
Negative 5323 pI am a beginning web developer building my website idea in wordpress. In my website I am planning on having two custom post types, call then type A and type B. I would like, for a user to be able to query all the type A posts that are associated with a specific type B post and the reverse as well all the type B posts that are associated with a specific type A post. So, I guess my first question is what should my approach be to do this Should I be using categories, custom taxonomies, just storing some array of meta information in each post detailing which posts of the other type are associated with it, or some other approachp  pMy second question is how to go about querying this information and then displaying it to the user. I mean, I realize this is kind of a simple question but how is this generally done Are all the posts queried and sorted on the server in php and then passed to the client machine If so, does one have to run some javascript to display the first 5 results on page 1, the second 5 on page 2 and so on Or, are each 5 results queried in batches as neededp  pI realize this question may be kind of vaguenaive. I am just beginning. Thanks in advance.p

Negative 5323 pWe are running into various codeStackOverflowExceptioncode and codeOutOfMemoryExceptioncodes when sending certain entities to the server as part of an codeInvokeServerMethodcode call.  The problem seems to come up because DevForce ends up trying to serialize a ton more data than we are expecting it to.  I tracked it down to data that is stored in the codeOriginalValuesMapcode.p  pThe original values are for codeDataEntityPropertiescode that weve added to the entity but that arent marked with code[DataMember]code so they normally dont get sent to the server.  emButem if we have an existing previously saved entity and then change one of those properties, the initial value of the property emdoesem end up getting serialized as part of the codeOriginalValuesMapcode.  This is causing us big problems because it turns out the original value is an entity that has a huge entity graph.p  pAdding to the problem, the entities we are dealing with are actually clones via codeICloneableorigEntity.Clonecode of existing previously saved entities so they have a state of detached and I havent found a way to clear the codeOriginalValuesMapcode for detached entities.  Usually Id do codemyEntity.EntityAspect.AcceptChangescode but that doesnt do anything for detached entities.  I couldnt find any other easy way to do this.p  pSo far, the only way Ive found to clear the original values is to attach the entity to an Entity Manager.  This ends up clearing the original values but it is a major pain because Im actually dealing with a large number of entities so performance is a concern and many of these entities dont have unique primary key values in fact, they dont have any key values filled in because they are just in memory objects that I dont plan to actually ever save so I need to do extra work to avoid duplicate key exception errors when adding them to an entity manager.p  pIs there some other way I can clear the original values for a detached entity  Or should detached entities even be tracking original values in the first place if things like AcceptChanges dont even work for detached entities  Or maybe a cloned entity shouldnt inherit the original values of its source  I dont really have a strong opinion on either of these possibilities...I just want to be able to serialize my entities.p  pOur app is a Silverlight client running DevForce 2012 v7.2.4.0p

Negative 5323 pThis is not really a question yet but rather sharing something that happened to me last night and the solution was completely different from those found on stackoverflow or google.p  pAfter adding some new functionality to an existing application which resulted on a couple of changes on the model I deployed the application to our development environment without an issue. However, when I deployed it to our production environment I started getting this There is already an object named TableName in the database. error.p  pClearly, Entity Framework was trying to recreate my model from scratch instead of updating it. After trying several solutions including the Global.asax SetInitializernull, resetting migrations, etc. nothing worked and would only lead to other errors.p  pAt some point I just rolled all of my emattempts to fixem changes back and started from scratch looking for a solution.p  pstrongThe solutionstrong was actually to go into the very first Migrations file typically called eminitem or emInitialem and comment out the code that was trying to create the tables. Afterwards, I could see that there was another migration trying to dropfield also generating an equally ugly error something along the lines of Unable to remove field FieldName because it doesnt exist, so I had to comment that line as well.p  pSo basically, after commenting out a few migration lines, strongeverything started working and the model did get upgraded to the latest versionstrong.p  pNow, heres the question. Clearly, Dev and Prd were out of sync DBwise which is fine, to my eyes but this ended up creating migrations that, for some reason, were not compatible with production and this is where I cannot understand how Entity Framework is not able to manage this. I mean, why was EF trying to create a table if it already existed And why was EF trying to drop a field that was not present in the table schemap  pIs this something not covered by EF Or did something happened at some point that messed up the entire EF set up of my projectp

Negative 5323 pFirst off, let me say that I just began using the pandas module a few days ago, so apologies if there is a simple solution to this that I was unaware of. I am trying to make a scatterplot in pandas using a specific row as the index for the xaxis and a specific row for the data to be plotted. I want this to be executed across all columns. Examplep  precodedf       col1  col2  col3 0     0     0    1 1     0.88  1     8.12 2     1    1     1 3     0     0     0 4     0.3   1    3.4     codepre  pSo, the idea is to create a scatterplot using 4 as the index xaxis and 1 as the data y axis where every column represents a point.p  pAny ideasp
Negative 5323 pWhats the best way to add an attribute like webkitfilterblur2px for example to every row only when the user hovers on a row and not have it set on the row being hovered So basically every row would be blurred except the one the user is hovering on and the effect would go away once the users mouse isnt hovering on any row all of the rows would become readable again without any effect.p

Negative 5323 pWere in the middle of doing a new data warehouse rollout using SQL Server 2014. One of my data sources is Oracle, and unfortunately the recommended Attunity component for quick data access is not available for SSIS 2014 just yet. p  pIve tried avoiding using OLEDB, as that requires installation of specific Oracle client tools that  have caused me a emlotem of frustration before, and with the Attunity stuff supposedly being in the works a hrefhttpsconnect.microsoft.comSQLServerfeedbackdetailview917247whenwillattunityssisconnectorsupportsqlserver2014 relnofollowMS promised theyd arrive in August alreadya, Im reluctant to go through the ordeal again.p  pTherefore, Im using ADO.NET. All things considered, performance is acceptable for the time being, with the exception of 1 particular table. p  pThis particular table in Oracle has a bunch of varchar columns, and Ive come to the conclusion that its because of the width of the selected row that this table performs particularly slow. To prove that, rather than selecting all columns as they exist in Oracle which is the original package I created, I truncated all widths to the maximum length of the values actually stored codeCASTcolumn AS varchar46code. This reduced the time to run the same package to 17 minutes still way below what Id call acceptable, and its not something Id put in production because itll open up a world of future pain, but it proves the width of the columns are definitely a factor.p  pI increased the network packet size in SQL Server, but that did not seem to help much. I have not managed to figure out a good way to alter the packet size on the ADO.NET connector for Oracle SQL Server does have that option. I attempted to see if adding codePacket size32000codeto the connection string for the Oracle connector, but that just threw an error, indicating it simply wont be accepted. The same applies to FetchSize.p  pEventually, I came up with a compromise where I split the load into three different parts, dividing the varchar columns between these parts, and using two codeMERGE JOINcode objects to well, merge the data back into a single combined dataset. Running that and doing some extrapolation leads me to think that method would have taken roughly 30 minutes to complete but without the potential of data loss using the codeCASTcode solution from above. However, thats still not acceptable.p  pIm currently in the process of trying some other options not using codeMERGE JOINcode but dumping into three different tables, and then merging those on the SQL Server itself, and splitting the package up into even more different loads in an attempt to further speed up the individual parts of the load, but surely there must be something easier.p  pDoes anyone have experience with how to load data from Oracle through ADO.NET, where wide rows would cause delays If so, are there any particular guidelines I should be aware of, or any additional tricks you might have come across that could help me reduce load time while the Attunity component is unavailablep  pThanksp

Negative 5323 pI am sure this is a terribly stupid question. But Ive used python for a year, i went through Learn Python the hard way, I went through the Zetcode WxPython Tutorial, I looked through the WXPython TextCtrl Demo, and Ive spent 2 days google searching for the answer to this seemingly simple question and Im not figuring it out. p  pAll I am trying to do is make a very simple test game where I have an input box, where the user types something like get pineapple, then presses [ENTER], and send this phrase to a function I will make that processes the request, then sends the output to an output box that says something like you cannot get the pineapple. Since I have coded lots of things at the office in python, and have coded fullfeatured financial models and games with VBA, I was sure this would be easy but it seems impossible. And WXPython is the obstacle.p  pIf i put a string variable under frame or panel or under the class objects for TC1 or TC2, then theyre treated as utterly alien and empty in the MainLoop, no matter where i put the variable its not recognized. It seems impossible to use the same variable when making a function under the TextCtrl1 and TextCtrl2, or vice versa. I think I have to do something wwith event.skip, or maybe make layers of passing things deep into the layers of WXPython and then pulling them all the way back out again, but I am not sure where to put it or how to do this.p  pAbove all please tell me how I can figure out the answers to questions like this myself I feel humiliated just asking it since it seems like it must be so easy, because if it were hard it would exist and be answered on this QampA website.p  pI have all the GUI skeleton looking good, I have the Enter keypress event working, i have my multimedia set up and working fine, I know how i will be setting up my objects, I just need to be pointed in the right direction here. Even if you could just show me how to take input from one textctrl, and pass it unchanged to the output readonly textctrl, that would be perfect and i could figure out the rest. I could post the rest of my code here but I read somewhere that was bad manners.p  pEDIT I am pasting the code here at the request of a wouldbe answerer.p  pThank you in advance.p  precodeimport wx from random import randint from pygame import mixer  Load the required library   mixer.init mixer.music.loadsog.ogg mixer.music.setvolume1.0 mixer.music.play  RandomSound1  mixer.SoundCritHit.wav RandomSound2  mixer.Soundswallow2.wav RandomSound3  mixer.Soundthunder2.wav  instantiate class  class MusTogButtwx.Button      def initself, args, kw         superMusTogButt, self.initargs, kw          self.Bindwx.EVTBUTTON, self.MusicToggleFunction      def MusicToggleFunctionself, mtf         if mixer.music.getbusy  True             print test, is playing             mixer.music.stop         else             mixer.music.play  class SoundTestButtwx.Button      def initself, args, kw         superSoundTestButt, self.initargs, kw          self.Bindwx.EVTBUTTON, self.PlayRandSound      def PlayRandSoundself, mtf         randsoundnum  randint 0,100         if randsoundnum lt 34             RandomSound1.play         elif randsoundnum  lt 68             RandomSound2.play         else             RandomSound3.play   class CPFInputterwx.TextCtrl      def initself, args, kw         superCPFInputter, self.initargs, kw          self.Bindwx.EVTCOMMANDENTER, self.TextEntryFunction      def TextEntryFunctionself, mtf         print you pressed enter   class Examplewx.Frame      def initself, parent, title         superExample, self.initparent, titletitle,             size800, 600           self.InitUI         self.Centre         self.Show       def InitUIself          panel  wx.Panelself                   This is an event handler.

Negative 5323 pWould anyone know why html5 video would not work only when run from an LMSLearning management system on an IPadp  pThis seems to be device specific.p  pIve tested 5 ipads, 3 have worked and 2 havent. Ive used two different models, the air and the model before the airhas the lightning port. The version of the OS has varied, but Ive had 7.1.2 produce different results, both of which were the air model.p  pIve tested 2 LMS systems and the devices that dont work, dont work on both LMSs.p  pI dont believe the content is at fault. I get the same results when using completely different tools to embed the video. Im currently using the projector html5 playerhand coding. But this content doesnt work when I use Lectora to publish it. Also Ive tested multiple videos encoded from multiple sources, same thing happens...p  pWhat really has me stumped is the fact I CAN play the videos on a normal webserver on these devices.p  pAny suggestions would be great. Even somewhere to start looking with IPad settings. Im at a lossp  pThanks in advancep  pAndroop  pOh, could embedded frames affect my results LMSSCORM players almost always run content through them.p

Negative 5323 pI followed this a hrefhttpazure.microsoft.comenusdocumentationarticlesmobileservicesdotnetbackendwindowsstoredotnetgetstartedusers relnofollowMicrosoft Azure Mobile Service Authentication Tutoriala, to try to add a server authentication function for my Windows Store C app. However, after completing every step, when I run my app, it showed that the application cannot connect to the service.p  pI found this useful a hrefhttpblogs.msdn.combcarlosfigueiraarchive20121023troubleshootingauthenticationissuesinazuremobileservices.aspx relnofollowbloga tallking about troubleshooting Azure Authentication issues in Azure Mobile Service. To troubleshoot, I type the link in the firefox web browser emmyServiceUrlloginaadem, but I receive the error response Authorization has been denied for this request.p  pI also followed the same tutorial to test with Google Log in. It turns out to work properly. And when I type the link emmyServiceUrllogingoogleem, the web browser directed me to the google log in page, unlike the Unauthorization error message when I type in emmyServiceUrlloginaadem. p  pAlthough google log in works out fine, but it is desired for us to use Azure Active Directory authentication. Could anyone tell us what could possibly be wrong Any troubleshooting suggestions are also appreciated. Thank you.p

Negative 5323 pI am trying to export my encoded text to a txt file. But somewhere in the export and import something goes wrong. During the same application i can export and import just fine. Encode and decode. But when I close the application and run it again then import previously encoded text, the input changes to something it wasnt, and throws off the decryption.p  pI believe it may have something to do with the cipher being randomly generated every time the application is run.

Negative 5323 pThis question is basically languageunspecific, but directed at languages which use OOP and have the possibility to create GUIs.br Nevertheless, if i need to provide examples, i will use Java as a reference.p  pAs Clean Code teaches us, composition is to favor over inheritence.br There now are many blog articles about this topic, some aimed at GUI development.br The most important for those guys sentence ive read so far is that you dont derive from JFrameJDialog.p  pOn the other hand, there is the rule to think of it as isa vs hasa where hasa indicates composition and isa clearly indicates inheritence.br Now the problem here is When i develop an application which stronghas astrong GUI, then this GUI strongis astrong JFrame or JDialog or whatever it is for the specific programming language, eg. codeSystem.Windows.Forms.Formcode for .NET Windows Forms. This GUI then stronghasstrong multiple controls.p  pFor me, the case is clearbr My application uses composition to have an instance of the GUI but the GUI itself uses inheritence because it strongis astrong JFrame and then this GUI again uses composition for the controls in it.br I would never think of using compisition for the GUI as in having a GuiManager for my GUI that has the JFrame strongandstrong all the controls of the GUI and then builds as in puts it together and displays it. After all, the controls are part of the GUI and therefore should be member variables of the it which is only possible if the GUI uses inheritence.br And to make it even more clear Yes, my GUI should behave like a JFrame and, if ever needed, should be used like a JFrame by other developers.p  pNow, the questions are isbr What is the emcorrectem approach in this casebr Am i completely wrong with my way of seeing itp  pThanks in advance for any input on this.p

Negative 5323 pabout this topic I would have two questions. The scenario is simple 1 sender and 1 receiver sharing a boost message queue.p  pQ1 If the sender removes the queue by the function emremovemyQueueem how can the receiver to be aware the queue no longer exists In my implementation the receiver uses the function emtimedreceive...em and if the sender removes the queue the function returns false, since timeout is reached. The problem, in my case, is that the receiver cannot tell if the queue has been deleted or the sender is not sending messages anymore.p  pQ2 I experience a different behaviour of the receiver depending on the language, C or C. Actually I created two receivers recv.c and recv.cpp. The sender is written in C. The operations sequence is the followingp  pSender  creates the queue myQueue  writes some messages  removes the queue  terminatesp  pReceiver  loops reading message on the queue myQueue, applying timeoutp  pSender  restarts  creates the queue myQueue  ...p  pWhen the sender terminates, the receiver keeps to try reading. The queue has been removed, so the read function goes in timeout. When I restart the sender, the C receiver properly resumes reading the messages . With the C version, instead, the receiver is not able to resume and the read function keeps going in timeout. Why the C version resumes while the C doesntp  pIf the sender terminates leaving the queue as it is and then restarts, the C receiver resumes properly. Unfortunately the implementation requires that if the sender has to terminate for any reason, the queue must be removed.p

Negative 5323 ol liShould you use a separate controller like sessionController, and pass around the desired variables to other controllers using the codeneedscode hookli ol  pThis seems like it would get very unDRY very quickly.p  pA simple internal variable like 1 wont get reflected in the URL. You can save it to the database but that seems costly and silly for something that gets changed frequently as part of the app experience, as opposed to an infrequently changed user setting.p  pIt seems the best way is to reflect the state in the URL one way or another. p  ol start2 liOr should you have a dynamic segment as the parent url segment to all your routesli ol  pIf you go with option 2, how do you obtain and remember the subroute url segments when using transitionTo or linktop  ol start3 lior should you change the query parameters in such a way that it sets it regardless of what route you may be inli ol  pWould this cause conflicts or management hassles if youre using other query parameters, or can you cleanly append and remove individual query parametersp  pOr is there another better way to handle such thingsp

Negative 5323 pCan anyone point to any guidancedocumentation on how items should be placed in a view controller that will be displayed as a popover so that the components are appropriately positioned with auto layoutp  pSpecifically Im working in Xcode 8.3 with the new Present as Popover segue, with the new universal storyboards. I add a view controller and then a popover segue to that view controller. When it is displayed, I see that roughly the topleft quadrant of the view controller is displayed as a popover, but that no auto layout appears to be taking place as far as I can see to accommodate the slightly different sizes of an iPad popover vs full screen behaviour on the different sized iPhones  so in effect, a slightly different section of the view controller is visible depending on the device.p  pI assume this isnt really how things are supposed to work, and the whole raison dtre of the universal popover segue is to appropriately fit things to the popover size via auto layout So can anyone shed some light on what Im doing wrong or how popups are supposed to work with respect to auto layoutp
Negative 5323 pI started a new iOS project about 4 months ago in Swift just to learn the language. While Ive been developing it, I found myself almost never using tuples in the entire program. This is because Im really used to Java and ObjectiveC which do not have tuples.p  pIve heard some great things about tuples, and Apple seemed very excited about adding them into Swift, but it seems like Im having a hard time finding a really useful case for them.p  pI understand and use them for one thing so far quickclass replacer. Instead of making a new class for the sole purpose of keeping a few properties together, use a tuple instead. But even then Ive only used a tuple for that once, because many times those properties affect each other, so those methods that alter those properties are better contained in a class with those properties. So is this really an advantagep  pBut what are some other really useful design patterns used in OOP or Swift that people who are new to tuples should know aboutp  pThanksp

Negative 5323 pIm on a project involving OCR. After detecting each character, I need to combine close characters to create words. To do that I tried to create a priority queue, containing information about detected characters the set of pixels forming the character and the position of the character on the document image, and gave higher priority to characters on top of the document, and higher to the leftmost character if two characters are on the same line. Then poll the characters out of the priority queue one after another, hoping that it would give me all the characters form left to right and up to bottom, and build words based on space between each two consequent characters. Which actually failed when the document is even slightly tilted, since some characters who are obviously on the same line for human eye are not necessarily on the same pixel height with 510px threshold.p  pIs there any algorithm for autostraightening the document or detecting the tilt angle Or any library for that Or if not, is there a way to work around this issue Its my final year project and I have a very less time to fix this. Please help. Thanks.p

Negative 5323 pWe are working on a  WPF application and we used  Install Shield Limited Edition to create  the installer of the application.  As per requirement we need to encrypt the App.config file. So we used an installer class and  encrypted the  app.config using DataProtectionConfigurationProvider. We have written the corresponding code to Install method of Installer Class.  To associate the installer class to Install Shields we used following way. p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comvXeaB.jpg altenter image description herep  pLater we have build the application and we are able to successfully create the installer. We also found the the App.config section is encrypted correctly.p  pNow the issue is Install method of Installer class not getting fired when we update to new version of the same product.  First our version was 1.0.1.0 and later we added  some feature to the application and created new version 1.0.1.1 . At that time we notice that the Install method of Installer class not getting fired.p  pHow we solve this issue I am stuck with this issue. Any help would be appreciable.p  pBest Regardsp  pRanishp
Negative 5323 pIm pretty sure this cant be done. But there are a lot of clever people out there, so here goes...p  pIm creating an UI shape using two elements that overlap. Essentially a large square with a round protrusion. p  pId like these two elements to appear as one object which is easy to do by giving them the same background color and overlap them but Id also like to have this element look like it has a single drop shadow. p  pThe catch is that drop shadows are translucent and where the two elements overlap, you will get a darker spot due to both shadow elements combining. p  pExample p  pa hrefhttpjsbin.commaboputexa1 relnofollowhttpjsbin.commaboputexa1ap  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comraGeq.png altenter image description herep  pBecause these are two HTML elements, Im pretty sure theres no way around this and this is just how it is. For now, Im going to try not using translucent objects and go with a flat solid color for the shadow. But if anyone knows of any tricks to make this work in CSS3 with all the new options, please let me know p  pNote that Im not referring to boxshadow properties as that wouldnt work with two objects as there always would have to be one object on top of the other. p

Negative 5323 pI am handling a huge catalogproduct based website on Magento with more than 10K SKUs.  We started off with Magento 7 years ago. Since then we have developed more than 10 magento websites  many stores on each magento installation. All these websites have many common products. The current project on which I am working is just a catalog with no cartbuying option.  For buying, we send the user to our parent site.p  pSo basically its a magento installation with memcache, Varnish , APC on Server. Whatever caching we do, we still get bottleneck whenever requests hit MySQL.p  pWe have decided to completely use MySQLMagento for backendproduct upload. Index whole website content to Solr documents and fetch the pages from Solr using NodeJS. Ultimately we want to achieve an environment where a User request would never go to MySQLMagento. User Search is Important. p  pAlso, we dont want to use Magentos PHTML anymore. Our Appfrontend will be an independent system which can fetch data from Solr not knowing who is indexing in Solr. We are doing this so that later our other MVCsCMSs can also index in same Solr.p  pMy Questionp  ol lipHow viable is this scenariopli lipWhat could be the Key Steps to do thispli ol  pPS I am experienced in MagentoPHPMysqlNoSQL with little exposure to LuceneSolr and NodeJS.

My IDE for the server is Eclipse 3.8 and it uses OpenSSL 1.0.1j.p  pTo get this code to work, you only need to include OpenSSLs root directory, add its library path to the linker and link to ssl, crypto and dl in that order.

Negative 5323 pI have read a lot about Oauth2 but still cannot understand, how does it work. I will explain how do I understand this protocol.    p  pThere are some main characters in Oauth protocol interaction.br User, application, resource provider and authorization server.br How do I understand main flow.br I am creating mobile client, so I will use it as an example.    p  pFirstly user installs app, than first time user run this app to access secured resources user have to enter password and login not directly credentials for resource server, but for authorization server. For example, I have online store app , user allowed to login via facebook account, so when user need to access resources from my site first step will authorize with facebook account. You enter login and password and if credentials are correct facebook server gives you or your app access token.    p  pAfter you got the access token, you store it on device in secure place or in local database for android it is SQLite.br When you successfully signed in, Oauth server redirects you to the resource provider server my online store wit token, resource server saves this token into the database along with user idlogin name. So now your resource server knows that user with such id can access secured resources with this token.    p  pOn the client side android app you now have this token, it has expire date.  When you need to access secure resources you pass this token in your POSTPUT or any request over HTTPS protocol, because if another person get this token, it can be used to access private, and make changes.     p  pFor example you need to place an order, from mobile client you make REST request with attached token, resource server checks this token and if it is the same as in the database you are allowed to accesschange secured resources.    p  pAm I right, or I dont understand Oauth protocol correctly      p  pNow my questions     p  ol lipIf I have native client, and I dont have ability for user to login with social network accounts and other Oauth2 servers in the network, only allow to login as on the web page  With password and login. In this case Oauth2 is not applicable in this case  If yes, next question.pli lipWhat should I use instead  I need to send credentials only once to my resource server, it will check them, generate token if everything is ok, put token into database, and return success response to the app. For instance using POST method over https connection to send password and login for the first time. Now resource server issues me the same token as in Oauth flow pli lipHow can I secure issued token  Make user reenter login and password after some time pli ol  pPlease help me to get this. I would be grateful for any help.p

Negative 5323 pI have a video conference with two areas for screen sharing and video feed for webcam. The first person who shares screen will display on the right. And after that, users can share their screens on the left container. This works fine when users are in the conference. p  pThe problem is that if the two screens are being shared and a user joins the video streams for screen sharing dont go where they are supposed to.

It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.     ltpgt  ltdivgt  ltdivgt lt end main container gt  ltdiv classhiddengtltpgtltpgtltdivgt lt blank space after content gt  ltfooter idmainfootergt  ltdiv idfooter classcontainergt      ltdivgt                 ltform classformfootergt                 lth4gtSIGN UP TO OUR NEWSLETTER HERE amprarr ltinput typeemail placeholderyouremail.com onfocusthis.placeholder   onblurthis.placeholder  youremail.com gtlth4gt ltinput typesubmitgt             lt end newsletter signup gt             ltbr gt                 lth4gtMY ACCOUNT amprarr ltinput typelogin placeholderyouremail.com onfocusthis.placeholder   onblurthis.placeholder  youremail.com gt ltinput typepassword placeholderpassword onfocusthis.placeholder   onblurthis.placeholder  password gtlth4gt ltinput typesubmit valueLogingt ltinput typesubmit valueRegistergt                 lta href stylefontsize 11px color B2B2B2gtltugtForgot Your Login Detailsltugtltagt                 lt end login gt             ltformgt          ltdiv classsocialgt              lta hrefgtHomeltagt             lta hrefgtServicesltagt             lta hrefgtStoreltagt              lta classsocialpic hrefgtltimg src.imagesSocialfb.pnggtltagt             lta classsocialpic hrefgtltimg src.imagesSocialtwitter.pnggtltagt             lta classsocialpic hrefgtltimg src.imagesSocialinstagram.pnggtltagt             lta classsocialpic hrefgtltimg src.imagesSociallinkedin.pnggtltagt             lta classsocialpic hrefgtltimg src.imagesSocialemail.pnggtltagt              lta hrefgtBlogltagt             lta hrefgtAboutltagt             lta hrefgtContactltagt          ltdivgt      ltdivgt      ltdiv classcopyrightgt         ltpgtCopyright ampcopy ltscriptgtdocument.writenew Date.getFullYearltscriptgt MIX IT IN THE BOX.

Negative 5323 pI have been hard at work revising my code, with the assistance of my peers here, and have come along ways. There are two issues I am facing that I would appreciate assistance on. First is within my MyListener class. Per previous tutorials and examples I looked at used JButton source  JButton e.getSource to check which action is being utilized. This was fine when I only used Buttons but now that I have RadioButtons it throws a castClassException. Not sure of a workaround for this. The next issue I face is my InsufficientFunds class, I placed big block quotes at these sections for better visualization. This class is set to throw exceptions when the balance is lower than the amount that is requested to be withdrawn or transferred. I set in place manual triggers for these events as I was unable to setup the class correctly to handle the situation. How would I properly set this class up to handle the exceptions and how would I implement them into the correct events under the Account class This is where it is suppose to be utilized Finally if anyone has further suggestions to my current code I would appreciate it as I am attempting to finalize the project.p  precodeimport java.awt. import java.awt.event.ActionEvent import

Negative 5323 pI am developing an agent that connects a client to a platform server. the agent is based on grizzlyframework. My agent gets a request from my client to register him to platform. So my agent will perform this operation. Then my Agent will wait for operations coming from platform and will notify the client of these operations. So the connection between my agent and the client will be maintained. If a new operation comes from the platform, I will make a serverpush to the client, since my client stays connected to me. I do not want that the client sends requests for new operations coming from platform  polling. I want that my agent pushes the operation POSTrequest to my client. I know that this serverpush is different from clientservermodel but I have heard that it is possible using grizzly.p  ptill now, I did find something helpful for the implementation of this idea in Java . This link a hrefhttpsgrizzly.java.netspdy.html relnofollowhttpsgrizzly.java.netspdy.htmla from grizzly describes a serverpush but this serverpush is not applicable for my case, since pushserver is executed, when a httprequest comes from client.p  pIs it possible to implement this idea using grizzlyp  pif yes, how to do itp  pEdit1 I noticed another problem when using httpserver of grizzlyframework. My agent consists in my case of two sides strongserversidestrong which get requests from client and strongclientsidestrong, which connects to platform. My Agent will get a request from a client. The grizzlybasedagent will launch a httphandler my clientsideagent which analyses this request. After analysing the request, this handler strongwill connect to platformstrong. After finishing the operation, he will send to the client http1.1 200 OK. If the same client decided to send me a new operation on the plaform, I should start a new connection to platform, which means for me to instantiate a new clientsideagent httphandler for the same client. I mean that I do not have access to the old instance old clientsideagent and I am obliged to make a new instance, which implies a lot of traffic that I need to avoid it. strongIn thisSituation, if a handler executes its non blocking operation, then this handler is lost, so that I cannot access him, which implies that I cannot get operations from platform and make a serverpushstrong. If I suspend the handler for period of time, all the coming requests from other clients will be blocked, so the clients cannot be serviced.p

Negative 5323 pIm trying to create a highlevel ObjectiveC OpenGL shader wrapper that allows me to execute various GL shaders without a lot of GL code that clutters the application logic.p  pSo something like this for a shader with two in arguments to create a quad with a different color in every cornerp  precodeOpenGLShader theShader  [OpenGLShaderManager shaderWithNameMyShader] glUseProgramtheShader.program  float colorsForQuad[4]  1.0f, 0.0f, 0.0f, 1.0f, 0.0f, 1.0 .... theShader.arguments[inColor] setValuecolorsForQuad forNumberOfVertices4]  float positionsForQuad[4]  1.0f, 1.0f, 0.0f, 1.0f, 1.0f, 1.0f, .... theShader.arguments[inPosition] setValuepositionsForQuad forNumberOfVertices4]  glDrawArraysGLTRIANGLEFAN, 0, 4 codepre  pThe codesetValueforNumberOfVerticescode function looks like thisp  precodeint bytesForGLType  numBytesForGLTypeself.openGLValueType glBindVertexArrayself.vertexArrayObject GetError  glBindBufferGLARRAYBUFFER, self.vertexBufferObject GetError  glBufferDataGLARRAYBUFFER, bytesForGLType  numVertices, value, GLSTATICDRAW GetError  glEnableVertexAttribArrayGLuintself.boundLocation GetError  glVertexAttribPointerGLuintself.boundLocation, numVertices,                               GLFLOAT, GLFALSE, 0, 0 codepre  pI think the problem is that each argument has its own VAO and VBO but the shader needs the data of all arguments when it is executed. I can obviously only bind one buffer at a time. The examples Ive seen so far only use one VAO and one VBO and create a C structure containing all the data needed. This however would make my current modular approach much harder.p  pIsnt there any option to have OpenGL copy the data so it doesnt need to be available and bound when glDraw... is calledp  pstrongEditstrongp  pI found out that using a shared Vertex Array Object is enough to solve the issue.
