Positive 1828 pCreate a class diagram based on the following descriptionp  pIn the modern world, many retail stores and even residential properties install video monitoring systems. A customer, who has a unique address, can choose to have one or more video monitoring system. Each video monitoring consists of a set of components namely video archive, video display, and video capture.p  pVideo archive stores video data according to a storage path either locally or through FTP. The video store operation will be different in each case.p  pThe video capture has a unique vendor with unique factory address and its main operation is to capture video. The video capture can be associated with any number of cameras.p  pAny camera will have a status attribute to define if it online or offline and it should stream the video buffer to the video capture component. There are two types of cameras IP camera or an analog camera. The stream video buffer operation will depend on the type of the camera. Moreover, if the camera is an analog camera then it will contain one encoder component inside it to encode raw video data from the camera sensor.p  pFinally, the customer is able to retrieve the video data only from local archive in the current system through the date and time parameters using a retrieve video operationp  pWhat i have done so far......p  pI have created a class customer with name and address as attribute and retrieve as operation with a 1 to many multiplicity.Then i made an aggregrate relationship between class and video system. Beneath customer i created a class video monitoring system with no attribute and no operation. Beneath class video monitoring system, I made a generalization relationship connecting Video archive has store as operation, video display and video capture. Video capture has Unique Address and capture as operation. Under capture, I made an association relationship with Ip camera and Analog camera and next to those is another class camera sensor that has raw data as attribute.......When I saw some of my class mates, answers today it wasnt as clumsy and bulky as mine.Their own look really professional I guess because nearly all of them have industrial experience unlike me. I just started learning programming last month really.....I need help.p

Negative 1828 pWhat is the best way in C to set up a container allowing for doubleindexing Specifically, I have a list of objects, each indexed by a key possibly multiple per key. This implies a multimap. The problem with this, however, is that it means a possibly worsethanlinear lookup to find the location of an object. Id rather avoid duplication of data, so having each object maintain its own coordinate and have to move itself in the map would be bad not to mention that moving your own object may indirectly call your destructor whilst in a member function. I would rather some container that maintains an index both by object pointer and coordinate, and that the objects themselves guarantee stable referencespointers. Then each object could store an iterator to the index including the coordinate, sufficiently abstracted, and know where it is. Boost.MultiIndex seems like the best idea, but its very scary and I dont wany my actual objects to need to be const.p  pWhat would you recommendp  pEDIT Boost Bimap seems nice, but does it provide stable indexing That is, if I change the coordinate, references to other elements must remain valid. The reason I want to use pointers for indexing is because objects have otherwise no intrinsic ordering, and a pointer can remain constant while the object changes allowing its use in a Boost MultiIndex, which, IIRC, does provide stable indexing.p

Negative 1828 pI have a subversion repo with directories that contain the usual sourcecontrolled files, but in addition to that contain files that are a dependency for execution, but not checked into source control and instead added as svnignore since they would be kept in duplicates all around the repo if they were checked in into all folders. believe me or not but there is a reason that is at least half good for having this duplication of the ignored files  p  pSometimes I want to branch out and make a local copy of the directory to do a certain defined development task, and then merge back into the trunk after a couple of checkins.

Negative 1828 pWhere is a good mathematical sets implementation for JavaScript It should include efficient implementations of intersection, union, complement, and for bonus points the Cartesian product.p  pNo, its not homework. I got a yubikey, it is a USB keyboard that types a sequence chosen from 16 keycodes to type a 128bit one time password otp. To make it more useful, software should detect the keyboard layout based on the characters produced and map those characters back to what they would be in the us layout for compatibility with the existing backend.p  pSo Ive got 93 different sequences of 16 characters representing everything the yubikey can type in each of 430 keyboard layouts. Many layouts are the same for this purpose. The possible mappings for a particular otp is each 16character sequence that contains every character in the otp.p  pTo find this efficiently I use a reverse index mapping each possible character to a list of the keyboard layouts that use that character. The answer is the intersection of each entry of the reverse index for each unique character in the otp. This almost always winds up with exactly 1 element.p  pIt would be easier to write this crossbrowser with a good implementation of codeSetcode.p  pCode so far is at a hrefhttpdingoskidneys.comdholthyubikey relnofollowhttpdingoskidneys.comdholthyubikeyap

Negative 1828 pIm creating a java program that creates a file and fills it with data in string form with each field in the record limited to a specific length.p  pWhat I think I need to do is to create a class that has a string for the data field and a length specifying the length of the string. And then somehow restrict it so that the string never exceeds this length, either by bailing, padding with whitespace if the data input is less that the length or truncating the end so the data fits.p  pMy first question is if there is already a basic class that will do this, or should I just roll my own.p  pMy second question is if I do roll my own how do I make sure when the class is constructed that the initial value of the internal String is less than the length specified, Ive read elsewhere that a constructor should return a value, but is it valid for a constructor to raise an exceptionp  pThanks for any help.p

Negative 1828 pI feel like I hit a wall trying to structure what I thought would be a simple database schema for modeling basic financial transactions. Im hoping some of you with more experience can weigh in and point me in the right direction.p  pMy application has four distinctly different types of leases that customers can purchase. As such, each type of lease has its own table, and in order to keep referential integrity, each lease table has its own transactions table.p  pMy original sketch looked like thisp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comahkBD.png p  pFirst off, I used a FK reference to Function Types to avoid using signed integers. It makes no sense to have a negative payment, so I figured it would work well for each transaction to have either a debit or credit reference. Does this make sensep  pAnother thing that was bothering me is that all transactions dont appear to be equal. That is, I feel like the transctions for this application should possibly be grouped into separate tables.p  pShould transactions such as flat rate fees, variable rate fees, payments, interest and voids all be stuffed into the same table It seems messy to me, but Im already stuck with a transactions table for each lease type so splitting those tables up even more is not very appealing.p  pJust about every transaction type other than payments will be built programmatically, so I can have references in the Notes field that specifies which payment a bounced check or void transaction is referencing. Is this good enough or am I thinking about this all wrongp  pThanksp

You are able to occasionally go over the intended spendable bounds.p  pSample will require jQuery UI, latest version from google CDN.p  precodeltscript typetextjavascript srchttpajax.googleapis.comajaxlibsjquery1.4.2jquery.min.jsgtltscriptgt ltscript typetextjavascript srchttpajax.googleapis.comajaxlibsjqueryui1.8.5jqueryui.jsgtltscriptgt codepre  h2Javascripth2  precodeltstyle typetextcssgt     eq gt div          width300px          eq gt div .slider          width 200px float left          eq gt div gt span          float right      ltstylegt  ltscript typetextjavascriptgt     document.readyfunction           var spendable  1000         var spent  0          function spendquantity              spent  quantity             attemptedToSpend.textspent                   function changeprevious, current              var adjustment  current  previous             change.textadjustment             return adjustment                   function calculateSpent              var totalled  0              eq .slider.eachfunction                   totalled  parseIntthis.parentdiveq0.find.spent.text                           spent.texttotalled                   eq .slider.eachfunction               var current  0             var previous  0             var adjustment  0              this.slider                 range min,                 value 0,                 min 0,                 max 500,                 step 1,                 animate true,                 orientation horizontal,                 start function event, ui                  ,                 stop function event, ui                  ,                 slide function event, ui                       set the current value to whatever is selected.                     current  ui.value                       determine the adjustment being made relative to the last                      adjustment, instead of just the sliders value.                     adjustment  changeprevious, current                      if spent gt spendable                          if adjustment gt 0                             return false                                            spend the points, if we are able to.                     spendadjustment                       set the previous value                     previous  current                      this.parentdiveq0.find.spent.textcurrent                      calculateSpent                                              ltscriptgt codepre  h2Htmlh2  precodeltp classuistatedefault uicornerall stylepadding 4px margintop 4emgt     ltspan stylefloat left margin 2px 5px 0 0gtltspangtDistribution ltpgt     ltstronggtTotal Points Spendable ltstronggtltdiv idspendablegt1000ltdivgt     ltstronggtTotal Points Spent Attempted ltstronggtltdiv idattemptedToSpendgt0ltdivgt     ltstronggtTotal Points Spent ltstronggtltdiv idspentgt0ltdivgt     ltstronggtChange ltstronggtltdiv idchangegt0ltdivgt     ltdiv idstatusgtltdivgt  ltdiv ideqgt     ltdiv stylemargin 15px idtest1gtTest1ltdivgt     ltbr gt     ltdiv classslidergtltdivgtltspan classspentgt0ltspangt      ltdiv stylemargin 15px idtest2gtTest2ltdivgt     ltbr gt     ltdiv classslidergtltdivgtltspan classspentgt0ltspangt      ltdiv stylemargin 15px idtest3gtTest3ltdivgt     ltbr gt     ltdiv classslidergtltdivgtltspan classspentgt0ltspangt      ltdiv stylemargin 15px idtest4gtTest4ltdivgt     ltbr gt     ltdiv classslidergtltdivgtltspan classspentgt0ltspangt      ltdiv stylemargin 15px idtest5gtTest5ltdivgt     ltbr gt     ltdiv classslidergtltdivgtltspan classspentgt0ltspangt ltdivgt codepre
Negative 1828 pI have a lucene index that i build and update using raw lucene indexers.  I was wondering if there is a way to force solr to reread the index without restarting the solr instance.  Ive tried the updatecommittrue but it doesnt seem to matter.  The only way i can be sure solr rereads the index is by a total restart, which of course is not ideal in a production environment.p

Negative 1828 pI added a RequiredFieldValidator to my InsertItemTemplate, and it seems to be working fine.

Negative 1828 pIm trying to create snippets of animation that will be reproduceable.p  pi.e. punch, walk one cycle, squatp  pEventually I want use external data to control how the character moves. For instance, reading in a text file and searching for keywords like love or anger and then creating a list of actions dependent on that data, like jump once for every love and walk one cycle for every anger.p  pInput text file, Output list of commands for the characterp  pOriginally my plan was thisp  p1 create motion presetsp  p2 write a script that would take in external data and call those motion presets based on the datap  pIt turns out that motion presets are pretty limited.  These motions punch, walk, ect recquire animating several parts of the character, so motion presets dont work well.p  pIt occured to me that all actions capable with the Flash GUI are probably possible to script in ActionScript.  Instead of using motion presets, I could have code snippets that would be called based on the input.p  pQuestion 1 Is that true Or are there some things you cant script like drawing perhapsp  pQuestion 2 If so, is there a way to record your actions in the GUI to a script  I have limited experience in Maya, but this is something that is possible with that software.  You can open up a scripting window, use the GUI, and all the commands you executed show up in the window.p  pAny advice in general for creating these reproduceable actionsp  pThanks so much for your helpp

Negative 1828 pIm creating an iPhone app which needs to connect to a PHPbased website. The iPhone app will retrieve and add records.

For example lambdasp  precodestudents.GroupBystudent gt student.State.Wherestudent gt student.Count gt 1.OrderByReversedstudentGroup gt studentGroup.Count codepre  pThis could be shortened by using really short variable namesp  precodestudents.GroupBys gt s.State.Wheres gt s.Count gt 1.OrderByReversedsg gt sg.Count codepre  pBut this way the variables are hard to understand outside of the context. A way to shorten it even further is to simply skip the singleparameter listing entirely, and have the parameter be implied by the dotp  precodestudents.GroupBy.State.Where.Count gt 1.OrderByReversed.Count codepre  pTo me this is a bit more readable than either of the above.

Often the name of the enum is passed too much when it is obvious from context which it is. For example working with OpenTK a C implementation of OpenGL, creating a simple textures requires calling something like this every timep  precodeGL.TexImage2DTextureTarget.Texture2D, 0, PixelInternalFormat.Rgba, bd.Width, bd.Height, 0, OpenTK.Graphics.OpenGL.PixelFormat.Bgr, PixelType.UnsignedByte, myPointer GL.TexParameterTextureTarget.Texture2D, TextureParameterName.TextureMinFilter, intTextureMinFilter.Linear GL.TexParameterTextureTarget.Texture2D, TextureParameterName.TextureMagFilter, intTextureMagFilter.Linear codepre  pNote that OpenTK.Graphics.OpenGL.PixelFormat has to be passed with the full name since it conflicts with System.Drawing.Imaging.PixelFormat using the dot notation this is no longer necessaryp  pThis contains a lot of enum callings which in the equivalent C implementation are much shorter, and thus easier to read at first glance. We could try to skip the enum names, and have them be inferred from the context the called methods parameter typep  precodeGL.TexImage2D.Texture2D, 0, .Rgba, bd.Width, bd.Height, 0, .Bgr, .UnsignedByte, myPointer GL.TexParameter.Texture2D, .TextureMinFilter, int.Linear GL.TexParameter.Texture2D, .TextureMagFilter, int.Linear codepre  pThis is not only short but its even shorter than the C equivalent, easy to read while preserving the stronglytyped nature of the language. Im sure there are other places where it could be used, these are just some examples of syntax Id love to see in some future C version. What do you think, would it be a good ideap

Negative 1828 pIm scratching my head here, as usual it seems with node projects, and Im not sure if Im doing something wrong or if Ive run into a bug. p  pIve got a schema of Server that can have any number of embedded docs called services. Im running into a problem though where, even though Ive successfully removed the individual service from the server object, when I tell it to save it doesnt remove it from the database. The save function is working because its saving any changes Ive made and is also pushing in new embedded docs, its just not removing one that are already there. p  pHere is a relatively simplified example of my codep  precodeapp.putserverid, functionreq, res, next   app.Server.findOneid req.params.id, functionerr, server      server.updated  new Date     ...      for var num  .sizereq.body.server.services  1 num gt 0 num        Is this a new service or an existing one       if server.services[num]           Is it marked for deletion If so, delete it         if req.body.server.services[num].delete  true            server.services[num].remove          else   else, update it           server.services[num].type  req.body.server.services[num].type           ...                 else           Its new, add it         delete req.body.server.services[num][delete]         server.services.pushreq.body.server.services[num]                  server.savefunctionerr       if err          req.flashsuccess, Server updated        else          req.flasherror, Err, Something broke when we tried to save your server. Sorry         console.logerr              res.redirect          codepre  pSo the remove is actually removing the service. If I do a server.toObject before the save, its not there. Any ideas why it wouldnt be removing it from the database when it savesp  pEdit I suppose the version numbers would be helpful. node0.4.2, mongoose1.1.5 express2.0.0rcp

Negative 1828 pI was wondering if there was a way to select different versions of the same jar at runtime. I am hoping to avoid using maven profiles since this would be a buildtime selection.p  pLets say there are two versions of the same jar p  pcodegreatFeatureversionA.jarcode codegreatFeatureversionB.jarcodep  pMy initial idea was to use JMX to create a basic runtime toggle selecting between those two jars which are both included in the classpath. Also, the contents of the two jars are the same no versioning or different naming of the internal classes.p  pSo when a class is requested, lets say from versionA, the class loader will always select the first one it finds, regardless of which jar it belongs to. p  pMy thinking is that no effective runtime toggling can be achieved this way. I was wondering if anyone might have a experienced something similar and have a recommended workaround. I am also hoping to avoid writing a custom class loader if possible.p  pMany thanksp  pP.S. Other related questions on SO indicate custom class loaders, like a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions4991527modifyclasspathatruntimecontrollingclassloadingorderthisa one.p

Ive tried moving the codeimport [class foo].hcode declaration around with no change. Ive tried renaming [class foo], cleaning the product, and rebuilding with no change.p  pLooking at the files in Finder, all the program classes are in the root directory for [app name] and only the two test files are in the root directory for [app name]Tests, which I believe is as it should be.p  pOften running the tests will actually work, even with this error, but sometimes it wont or the breakpoints will perform unpredictably in [class foo], which is really annoying.

There are a few modules that I am now having difficultly installing psycopg2 and mysqlpython.  The warning messages in homebrew constantly warn me about not having a 64bit version of Python on the path.  These warnings only add to my list of wanting to use a 64 bit version.  p  pAt the time I selected the 32bit install, the GUI for a particular project was the main focus.  Now the GUI has been come very simple and the database backend support using Django is much more important.  This being said, using the development version of wxPython 2.9 which supports OS X and 64bit 2.7 has become acceptable.p  pFor the nonmac users, to help explain why I had to use the 32bit version please see this a hrefhttpbatok.github.comvirtualenvwxp relnofollowBrief guide to using virtualenv in a wxpython projecta  p  pstrongSystem Informationstrongbr emDevelopment Systemembr emOSem Mac OS X Snow Leopard 10.6.7br emPythonem 2.7.1 with virutalenv  virutalenvwrapperbr emProject Dependenciesembr Note that MySQL could be PostgresSQLs psycopg2 if I can get the postgresql to install with homebrew  p  blockquote   pDjango1.2.5br   MySQLpython1.2.3br   PIL1.1.7br   PyVISA1.3br   pyserial2.5br   virtualenv1.5.1br   virtualenvwrapper2.6.3br   wsgiref0.1.2br   wxPython2.8.11.0br   wxPythoncommon2.8.11.0  p blockquote  pemDeployment Systemembr emOSem Windows XP  Windows 7br emPythonem Hopefully none goal to use py2exe, or similar tool  p  pstrongCurrent Thoughtsstrongbr I fear that my goal cannot be accomplished based on the file paths alone.

Why we cannot use codeltModel.account.aspnetusers.vehicle.make gtcode Where codeaspnetuserscode is associated with account through a foreign key vice versa. MVC 2 only allows codeltModel.account.aspnetusers.vehicle gtcode Therfore I cant use the associated property of vehicle which in this case is codevehicle.makecode.

Negative 1828 pHeres the situation p  ul liThe application world consists of hundreds of thousands of states. li liGiven a state, I can work out a set of 3 or 4 other reachable states. A simple recursion can build a tree of states that gets very large very fast. li liI need to perform a DFS to a specific depth in this tree from the root state, to search for the subtree which contains the minimal state calculating the value of the node is irrelevant to the question. li ul  pUsing a single thread to perform the DFS works, but is very slow. Covering 15 levels down can take a few good minutes, and I need to improve this atrocious performance. Trying to assign a thread to each subtree created too many threads and caused an codeOutOfMemoryErrorcode. Using a codeThreadPoolExecutorcode wasnt much better.p  pstrongMy questionstrong Whats the most efficient way to traverse this large treep

The most common one is the codebigmemorycode package.p  pWhen writing to the files, Ive learned the hard way to flush output buffers, otherwise all bets are off on whether the data was saved.  However, this can lead to some very long wait times while codebigmemorycode does its thing many minutes.

Negative 1828 pIve just started to try out RestKit for an iOS app im building. I normally use ASIHttpRequest, but I want to test out RestKit mostly for its object mapping between JSON and CoreData. There are some great things about RestKit, but Ive run into an issue that really makes it feel deficient, unless Im doing something wrong or have missed something. I hope someone here can guide me on that.p  pIm using RKObjectLoader to make async amp sync calls to a REST API. My service is designed to send back proper HTTP status codes, along with some sort of description, a 401 being an example of when the API needs an authenticated user. p  pMy problem is that RestKit stops acting normally if i get a 401 error back. The RKResponse object has a status code of 0, even though it has a payload in it. Im pretty sure this comes down to NSURLConnections poor handling of HTTP statuses, but I would expect RestKit to wrap around this somehow. Especially since the RKResponse class has quite a few wrapper functions to determine the status code of the response isOK, isCreated, isForbidden, isUnauthorized, etc..p  pIn comparison, ASIHttpRequest doesnt use NSURLConnection, but instead uses the lower level CFNetwork code. ASIHttpRequest allows me to see exactly what came back over HTTP without sending out errors left amp right.p  pQuestion is, am I doing something wrong, or is this the expected behavior out of RestKit Has anyone successfully been able to make a calls to [RKResponse isAuthenticated] Although its inconclusive to me, is there any difference between running in async and sync mode in this regard. I did read somewhere that NSURLConnection run in sync mode will act a bit differently, even though the underlying code is just calling the async operations. Does this have more to do with me using RKObjectLoader as opposed to just RKRequest Perhaps the fact that the payload cant map to a model causes anger, but it seems that the code is breaking earlier within RKRequest.sendSynchronously, prior to when mapping actually takes place.p  pBottom line is my code needs to be able to freely read HTTP status codes. Any guidance would be most appreciated.p  pHaiderp

Negative 1828 pIm implementing malloc in C, and right now my free list is maintained in LIFO order i.e. newly freed blocks are added to the beginning of the list and my allocator uses a first fit algorithm to search for free blocks of memory. My textbook mentions that maintaining the list in address order enjoys better memory utilization than a list in LIFO order in this situation, but I dont understand why and it doesnt explain. Eventually Ill implement a buddy system or something similar, but for now I just want to understand this.p

Negative 1828 pIm trying to build an application that displays in a GUI the contents of a log file, written by a separate program that I call through subprocess. The application runs in Windows, and is a binary that I have no control over. Also, this application Actel Designer if anyone cares will write its output to a log file regardless of how I redirect the output of subprocess, so using a pipe for the output doesnt seem to be an option. The bottom line is that I seem to be forced into reading from a log file at the same time another thread may be writing to it. My question is if there is a way that I can keep the GUIs display of the log files contents up to date in a robust way p  pIve tried the followingp  ol liNaively opening the file for reading periodically while the child process is running causes Python to crash Im guessing because the child thread is writing to the file while Im attempting to read its contentsli liNext I tried to open a file handle to the log filename before invoking the child process with GENERICREAD, and SHAREDREAD  SHAREDWRITE  SHAREDDELETE and reading back from that file. With this approach, the file appears emptyli ol  pThanks for any help you can provide  Im not a professional programmer and Ive been pulling my hair out over this for a week.p

Now I want an Android application that does more or less the same as the example Tonr application. Accessing the photo resources from the sparklr application using OAuth 2.0p  pBut Im stuck. Im using the leeloo libraries which have been moved to apache amber. To be exact Im using the following tutorial a hrefhttpsimpleprogrammer.com20110525oauthandrestinandroidpart1 relnofollowhttpsimpleprogrammer.com20110525oauthandrestinandroidpart1ap  pThe first fase of the application works. The browser starts and I get the sparklr page to login and authorize the request. But when I try to get the access token the application crashes. I didnt get any wiser from the logcat so I used debug to get the request.

Negative 1828 pWe are using Atlassians Crucible right now for code reviews we arent really using the FishEye part and its starting to get unusable, mainly due to a hrefhttpsjira.atlassian.combrowseFE3461performance issuesa in indexing a large repo and multiple repos.  p  pOur code is hosted at Github and developers are encouraged to fork the repo and do all of their work in their own forks.  For this to work with Crucible, we need to index all developers forks.  Weve started to do this, but it takes an incredibly long time hours per commit.  See the link above.p  pHow does Gerrit compare Does it index the repos p  pI know people will comment as say the Github has pull requests for code reviews we use them but the pull request is really done at the end of the workflow once its been reviewed.  We have a team of about 20 people developing, and there isnt a system in Github to manage what reviewspull requests need to be completed by which developer.  In addition, the Crucible to JIRA integration is nice and we take advantage of that.p  pIm open to other code review tools as well, not just Gerrit.p

Negative 1828 pI have a cocos2d project. Everything works fine, except when I am replacing a scene. When replacing the scene, I receive the message Message sent to deallocated instance followed by a memory address.p  pThe way my project is structured, most CCNodes are children of the main Scene which is replaced. These nodes are also stored in various arrays for iterating among similar objects etc.p  pI cant imagine how I am overreleasing any of the objects, since adding to arrays should increase the reference count, as should adding to the main scene.p  pShould I do something about this What happens if I ignore it Turn NSZombies off The error pops up when objects are being deallocated, so it should just mean that the object is already release rightp  pAny suggestions on how I can figure out what I am doing wrongp
Negative 1828 pIve got a subclass of UIControl which represents a slider switch, with a variable percent which stores the current position of the slider, i.e. 0.0 means the slider is on the left, 1.0 means the slider is on the right. I have two images which look like speech bubbles, and when the user clicks the slider I want to display one of these images they are the same size but look different, designed so one is displayed if percent lt 0.5 and the other one if percent  0.5 and have the tail of the speech bubble follow the slider i.e. the frame is set as a function of the percentage.p  pI have created a custom UIView for the image which changes the image to display via a boolean parameter. I have tried creating a parameter in the UIControl subclass that draws the UIView along with all the other drawing, but I need to draw it outside the UIControls rect, which cant be done from inside the UIControls drawRect method. What would be a good way of managing these two views and making sure the speech bubble always updates when the percentage value of the UIControl changesp

Negative 1828 pIm creating a website that will feature news articles. These articles will appear in two columns at the bottom of the page. There will be a button at the bottom to load additional news stories. That means that I need to be able to specify what news story to load. Serverside, Im simply implementing this with a LIMIT clause in my SQL statement, supplying the first parameter like sop  precodeSELECT   FROM news  ORDER BY date DESC  LIMIT first, 1 codepre  pThis means that, clientside, I need to keep track of how many news items Ive loaded. Ive implemented this by having the function to load new information be kept in an object with a property holding the number of items loaded. Im worried that this is somehow a race condition that I am not seeing, though, where my codeloadNewInformationcode will be called twice before the number is incremented. My code is as followsp  precodevar News        newInfoItems 0,      loadNewInformation functionside          this.newInfoItems  1         jQuery.get             apinews this.newInfoItems  1,             functionhtml                  jQuerydiv.colside.appendhtml                             codepre  pOn page load, this is being called in the following fashionp  precodeNews.loadNewInformationleft News.loadNewInformationright codepre  pI could have implemented this in such a way that the success handler of a first call made another AJAX request for the second, which clearly would not be a race condition...but this seems like sloppy code.

Negative 1828 pMy company uses Subversion I prefer Git.  I have cloned the Subversion repository on my work machine using gitsvn and am relatively comfortable using Git as a Subversion client.  Now I would like to take the arrangement a step further and leverage the decentralized nature of Git to be able to work on this project from outside the office.  Ideally, I would like to mirror all change to my local office working copy to my Github account and also the reverse  have all changes to my Github repository made while out of the office be syncedpushedmirrored to the working copy on my work machine which is the cloned Subversion repository.  Is this possible  How would I begin  Is there another arrangement which will allow me to work away from the office yet still have the working copy at the office be my primary workspacep

The emStoreem group can be toggled to hide all of the subgroups and the total in teh bottem.I would like it so that the total count and cost on top are hidden when expanded like this, yet be visible when collapsed.brbr I have tried many expressions, but cannot seem to access the visibility property of the group. I was wondering if there is a way to access group properties so I can create an expression in the visibility group. I have tried changing the visibility to those text boxes to false and set the toggle to the textbox that Pet Store A is in, but that will hide the whole row group, which is not what I desire. brbr Thanks a lot in advancep

Negative 1828 pWe have a system that allows our parents I work for a school district to access district and class resources. It is a thirdparty product, which is the source of the problem. When a parent logs in, they are actually logging in to a site that I have built. I have to do some checks on their account to see whether they are authorized to pass on to the thirdparty site. If they are authorized, I simply do an automated form submit with the appropriate login information for the parent.p  pThe problem Im having is that our vendor doesnt regularly load new data. So, if a student is newly registered at one of our schools, the parent can login and authorize on my side but when I send them to the thirdparty site, they get an error message indicating no students. I have no way of querying the vendor to see if they will allow the parent in.p  pWhat I need to do is run the forms submit to the third party in a testing mode that will capture the resulting page in a buffer so I can test the buffer for the error message. If the error message exists, Ill keep them on my side and present them with basic resources. Otherwise, if the error message doesnt exist, I need to do the actual form submit and allow the browser to redirect.

Negative 1828 p1Im trying to make a limitless factorial function just out of curiosity.

GeekTool allows you to place little windows called geeklets onto the Desktop.

But when I run the script in GeekTool, it is not the escape sequences are not shown in the output, but there is no color.  I know GeekTool supports ANSI escape sequences, because when I run this shell commandp  precodeprintf e[03549mabcde[0m codepre  pI get colorized GeekTool output.  codeecho SHELLcode also tells me that GeekTool is using the same zsh executable I normally use.

I tried switching to codepcode.  When run in the terminal, this yields noncolorized output with the escape sequences intact.  When run in GeekTool, I also get noncolorized output, but the escape sequences have again disappeared.p  pAnyone know where my escape sequences are goingp

Negative 1828 pI am having a problem with a system I am building. I have successfully implemented a SP initiated SSO system. However, the issue arises when considering that this system has multiple unique and fully segregated Service Providers that must be capable of interacting and exchanging data. When one SP SP1 needs to communicate to another SP SP2, they need to be able to seamlessly transition while remaining secure. Thus, I assume they need to be able to assert or share SAML data. p  pFor instance, a user tries to access the system via SP1 and is redirected to the IdP. The user authenticates against the IdP which will then assert via http post back to SP1. The user now performs a series of tasks on SP1 which eventually require data transmission or a browser redirect to SP2. SP2 is unaware that SP1 had successfully authenticated the user and received a SAML response from the IdP. This is where my problem arises. I need to implement a mechanism that will allow SP2 to become aware of the users status on SP1. More generally, I need to allow any service provider in a set of service providers to make assertions to one another about the status of a user. However, I cannot find documentation on the official way to accomplish this task. p  pI have thought of multiple solutions to the problem but I doubt that any of them are official in the least.  One would be persisting a list of SAML assertions on the IdP which can be referenced by guid. Then passing a link from SP1 to SP2 which would reference a controller action and guid that would allow the IdP to reassert data to SP2. This seems slow and convoluted.  Two would be persisting the SAML response somehow after the response is received on SP1 and somehow passing the data to SP2 whenever a user is redirected. p  pI may be overthinking and over complicating this process. I may need to move to an IdP initiated SSO based solution. I may be over looking something in the documentation. p  pIf anyone could shed any light on this topic, it would be appreciated. I will be glad to provide any additional information about the subject. p

When I checked the content of the java directories in binrepackagedclasses.jar, they were empty with all of their content transferred to the equivalent renamed directories java.p  pPlease also note that the suggestions I followed using ant and jarjar were more than two years old and applied to android 2.x. It is possible likely that with android 4 and related infrastructure they will not work, just a guess.p  pOne last point.

The codeSystem.Diagnostics.CodeAnalysiscode namespace sounds interesting, but it only contains two attributes for suppressing warnings and excluding code from coverage.p  pEDIT  While poking through ILSpy I discovered that I knew, but didnt put together, that enum values in methods get converted to their integer value when used in the above manner when compiled.p

Negative 1828 pHeres some background. Im working on game similar to Collapse. Blocks fill up at the bottom and when all twelve blocks have been filled they push up on to the playfield. I have a counter called intNextSpawn that not only tells when to push up the next row, as well as calculating vectors for the graphics. It resets to 0 when the blocks have been pushed up.p  pIve added some debug text on the screen to try and see what is happening, but I cant seem to hunt down the issue. It almost seems like it is still incrementing the counter while trying to randomize the the block thats supposed to appear things acting out of order. I end up getting blank blocks and it causes some really screwy effects while testing. It gets worse when jack up the speed.p  pIm willing to post any additional code that might help. Below are the two main blocks where this is could happening. Is there something I might be doing wrong or may there be a way I can prevent this from happening if thats what its doingp  pAny help would be greatly appreciated.p  pemEdit...

Negative 1828 pIm having trouble updating a project someone else created in Xcode. This is an app built in storyboard and in one case, there is a scene with a view controller that has multiple views underneath it in the document outline palette of the storyboard editor shown in included image. The first view is the one that becomes highlighted in the storyboard editor when it is clicked on, and as you change the design or the objects in the view that view is updated. There is a second view the one beneath exit and first responder that is somehow attached to that scene but I cannot figure out how to edit the emdesignem of that view. If I click on that view or any of its children, I can clearly see their attributes in the various inspectors on the right hand side connections, attributes, etc..p  pedit 1  the original version of this question suggested that these additional views were used for special layouts needed when switching to landscape. They are actually used more generally than that, for example, when displaying popups over the active view.p  pIn any event, my primary interest is in being able to modify this second view. It seems like there must be a way to see it in the editor and Im just missing it. Ive searched for tutorials on implementing portrait and landscape views in storyboards none seem to use this method, for phrases like multiple views in storyboard scene, and looked through the menu options including a promising option unembed when the second view is selected, but when clicked it removes the view from the scene and then I cant find it. Im at a loss of where to look to learn more. How can I edit this view Any help is appreciated.p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comcrfaP.png altViewController scene in document outlinep

Negative 1828 pIm working in Entity Framework 5.  Were using Microsoft Active Directory for user authentication.  Were using a proper ntier architecture, so for the most part, the business layer is blissfully unaware of the UI.p  pNow we have a requirement to keep a full audit trail every time any write operation happens on the database, we have to save it to our audit log, along with who made the change.p  pCatching the write should be relatively simple Ill just override codeSaveChangescode in my data context and use the codeObjectStateManagercode to find all the inserts, updates and deletes.  The real issue will be detecting who the current user is, since authentication is done on the presentation layer, and the business layer DLL will be hosted on IIS, servicing any number of client processes.  p  pIs there some way to detect the authentication credentials that were used by the client, inside the business layer  I definitely do not want to have to pass user ID to every interface in the APIp  pFWIW, Im also using EntityFramework.Extended, which supposedly has some native AuditLog capabilities, but the a hrefhttpsgithub.comloresoftEntityFramework.ExtendedwikiAuditLog relnofollowdocumentationa is woefully inadequate.

To start, the codeorganizerscode array is a simple 1D array of strings that all have small lengths under 20 chars. I think the issue might be that codeorganizerscode is more than 10,000 indices long. Are there limitations on the length of an array that can be imploded Are there workarounds for that I cannot find anything in the manual, but I have tested this code thoroughly and I believe the error must be on codeimplodecode.p

Negative 1828 pA primarily technical questionp  pI am developing an interface that  put basically  will have a somewhatrandomizedlooking background using predefined square tiles. Each tile will very simply have a number of arbitrarily placed circles of varying sizes inside it. There will be stronga lotstrong of tiles and lets assume theyll all be unique.p  pOne option Ive been toying with is the idea that I could use text periods of varying fontsizes and a codewhitespace prewrapcode style for each tile. I think Ive determined that in terms of filesize, this would be smaller than using images of the circles... it would also be somewhat clever.p  pThere are certain things Im not hip to, however. For instance, perhaps the caching of images would end up making them eventually load faster than blocks of spacesperiods on pageload even though they would take a bit longer initially to download.p  pIve considered that determining the overall dimensions of text would be a bit of a nightmare, but I dont emreallyem need to know that information, and I figure if I use a font like Georgia which seems to be included across all systemsbrowsers, I could probably find that information anyways.p  pIf you had all the time in the world and you wanted to make the project as aesthetically perfect as you could internally and externally, how would you approach this scenariop

Once again, they didnt like that either.p  pMy app monitors the accelerometer as well but not always, only when chosen by the user.p  pMy question is, how are apps like Skype, and other similar apps able to turn the status bar red, and stay in the background Even some alarm apps will do this, without playing any audio or anything.p  pAlso I cant use the notification system because it does not update fast enough if Im monitoring the battery level.

Why did they go with this name, as opposed to something like codememorypoolcode  Am I under the wrong impression that boosts object pool is really a memory pooling scheme  Or are they essentially the same thing  Also, why hasnt there been a standard implementation of a more highlevel object pool patternp

If I understand it correctly, the strange code, and according to the ASCII table reads m a n, and parseInt is supposed to return an integer based on a hexadecimal radix. It then gets converted once again into a string, this time based on the chars decimal value. To finish it all, we evaluate the return x by negating it not the word I was looking for but cant remember a better one at the time... evaluate maybe.p  pThen, why is the output false If we dont evaluate the return the result is the expected one man, but I dont see why we get false on this particular instance.p  pAnyone care to elaboratep

Negative 1828 pI really need to start to start improving my programming skills, a lot. Thats why every other week, Ive been trying to practice some programming exercises when Im not working my summer job before school starts back up in the fall. For this one, I decided to do a basic AVL tree. But Iam having so much difficulty with it. I posted the rotation functions, and the insert functions. But I know they must be way off, because when I compile the code, it shows no errors or warnings, but when I run it, it says, Bus error. I dont know why I am getting this. Can you guys give me some tips and point me in the right direction. This is really annoying me because I know this exercise shouldnt be this difficult. The only thing I can think of is that Im doing shallow copying instead of deep copying Anyway, thanks in advance.p  precode    NODE rightrotationNODE node              NODE roottemp, lefttemp             roottemp  node         lefttemp  nodegtleft          node  lefttemp         nodegtheight  lefttempgtheight  1         nodegtleft  lefttempgtleft         nodegtleftgtheight  lefttempgtleftgtheight  1         nodegtright  roottemp         nodegtrightgtheight  roottempgtheight  1         nodegtrightgtleft  lefttempgtright         nodegtrightgtleftgtheight  lefttempgtrightgtheight  1         nodegtrightgtright  roottempgtright         nodegtrightgtrightgtheight  roottempgtrightgtheight  2         freenodegtleftgtleft         return node         NODE insertNODE node, int value             NODE leaf          ifnode  NULL                       leaf  mallocsizeofNODE              leafgtval  value              leafgtleft  NULL              leafgtright  NULL              leafgtheight  0              leafgtheight  nodegtheight  1              return leaf                 ifnodegtval  value              return node        ifvalue lt nodegtval                      nodegtleft  insertnodegtleft, value              nodegtleftgtheight  nodegtheight  1              if balancenode  2                                     if balancenodegtleft                                           node  rightrotationnode                                    else                                         nodegtleft  leftrotationnodegtleft                       node  rightrotationnode                                                    return node              else                     nodegtright  insertnodegtright, value              nodegtrightgtheight  nodegtheight  1              if balancenode  2                                   if balancenodegtright                                                node  leftrotationnode                                        else                                              nodegtright  rightrotationnodegtright                          node  leftrotationnode                                                              return node                   void bstinsertBST tree, int value                  treegtroot  insert treegtroot, value       codepre

Negative 1828 pIm writing a report to represent the schedule of work for a given customer. The report has to resemble a calendar, and show work orders that span multiple days as a spanning bar similar to Outlook. p  pI made the calendar fairly quickly using two tablix controls. My problem now, and the reason for this question, is representing the spanning events. p  pCurrently, I render using test data of course a hrefhttpi.imgur.comKISNhsx.png relnofollowhttpi.imgur.comKISNhsx.pngap  pIm determining a lot of things in the stored procedure how many days a given event spans, which day that given event is and manipulating the background and borders of each cell so that they emappearem to be merged. This works alright with the exception of the cell text its cut off if the name of the event is too long.p  pIve done some research, and it appears that you just cant programmatically merge cells. I think my best hope might be somehow allowing the name of the event to overflow sort of how you would see a cell overflow in Excel. p  pIs that possiblep  pFor reference, were using SQL Server 2012, but Im using BIDS via VS2008 to make the report. Its a runofthemill RDL report. Im not against buying a control that would do this for me instead. p  pThanksp

Negative 1828 pDisclaimer using cloud services like Amazon S3 or Azure Blob Storage isnt an option at all.p  pGoal hosting millions  of images and video files on Windows Servers. I am aware of the limitations of NTFS in that context. So I gave MongoDB with GridFS with its 2 GB containers a try which worked well but a bit slowly I did not figure out why yet.p  pMy questionsp  ol liAre there any real world reports regarding the usage of MongoDBGridFS in context of large  amounts of filesli liIs there any known other option which is reliable, easily configureable and horizontal scalableli ol  pI know that my scenario is described very vague, but I dont have any real data for now, so please dont blame me .p  p propably only tens of thousands to hundreds of thousands, but hopefully someday millions ...p  pThanksp
Negative 1828 pIve signed up for a developer account on BigCommerce and would like to be able to set up my own sandbox style store where I can use the data from my actual store without actually changing anything in production, like how other sandbox developer environments work.  Is this possiblep  pI know of the big open sandbox for you to play with a hrefhttpstorebwvr466.mybigcommerce.com relnofollowstorebwvr466.mybigcommerce.coma but this is open to ballb developer accounts, so I shouldnt work with real data there because other developers could get to it andor change the same things that Im working on.p  pAlso Im having the same issue as a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions17451556addingapikeyfrombigcommercestorethis BigCommerce Developera as well.  Would adding an API key to the Dashboard have something to do with possibly having a sandbox, since the only API key on the dashboard right now is for the sandboxp

My only guess as to why this might be the case is that OpenBSD has some underlying permissions structure that is using the ownershippermissions of the directory where isetuidmin.bini resides, or that is not actually changing ownershipSUID bit when an unprivileged user uses isudoi to change file permissions.p

Negative 1828 pI have many 30 Java enums which are mapped to integer ids in the database. I would like to be able to sort by these without modifying many queries, and be able to index on the sort order.p  pExample  note that many of the other enums may have a dozen or so options, so arent quite this trivial p  pTable 1 Person Name varchar, Sex enum Bob, 0 Fred, 0 Susan, 1 Jamie, 2p  pJava enum   Male0, Female1, Unknown2p  pI would like to be able to just do order by person.sex, and have the order be Female, Male, Unknown. or 1,0,2 in numeric order. Ideally this order would be variable based on language, but it would be ok to have 1 languagedatabase.p  pI realize I could order by a case clause, but this would require changing a very large number of places in the application, including many dynamically generated queries.p  pI also support postgres, which allows me to define this as an enum 1, 0, 2, solving all of these problems, at least for 1 languagedatabase. Something like this would be very valuable.p  pI have thought about just making a sex table with ids and names, and sorting by that. Unfortunately, to order the person table many million entries by sex, it takes quite a long time as I can then not make an index on the sex column or at least one useful in sorting.p  pI have thought about using a custom type as well, but at that point am not quite sure how to integrate it with hibernate custom types dont seem to actually be that flexible. p  pAny thoughts would be appreciated. Thanks.p

Negative 1828 pSo for a project Ive implemented a balanced KDTree and knearest neighbors search algorithm for it the traditional way as a standard tree  i.e. I have node structs like the followingp  precodestruct KDNode     int level used for x,y,z axis splitting     Point pos     KDNode left, right Child nodes  codepre  p...and then store the tree in memory as an actual tree data structure. However, I recently heard that it is possible to store a KDTree in memory as a large array without having to create any node objects and that this method of construction would be much more efficient memory wise and   timeperformance wise.p  pHowever, Im not at all sure how such a construction would work and cannot find anything online detailing exactly how I would go about implementing a KDTree this way. p  pSo my question is, how would one go about implementing a KDTree as a singledimensional array without the use of nodes p

Negative 1828 pI have been asked to create two toggle tabsbuttons within a single column on a web page which a visitor can toggle in between without changing the rest of the page elements. The tabs are meant to look like the Personal and Business tabs at www.vodafone.co.uk but toggling between them should not take you to different web pages.p  pI first thought this can only be done using JavaScript, but then the top page of www.vodafone.co.uk only uses HTML and CSS to accomplish it although clicking either tab takes you to another web page, which my client does not want. Is there a way to present two tabs which you can click to display different lists without affecting the rest of the pagep  pAny helpful tips would be appreciated.p  pThank you in advance,p  pEadp

Negative 1828 pIm curious if there is a way to lock a codemultiprocessing.Queuecode object manually. p  pI have a pretty standard ProducerConsumer pattern set up in which my main thread is constantly producing a series of values, and a pool of codemultiprocessing.Processcode workers is acting on the values produced. p  pIt is all controlled via a sole codemultiprocessing.Queuecode. p  precodeimport time import multiprocessing   class Readermultiprocessing.Process      def initself, queue          multiprocessing.Process.initself         self.queue  queue       def runself          while True              item  self.queue.get              if isinstanceitem, str                  break    if name  main       queue  multiprocessing.Queue     reader  Readerqueue     reader.start       starttime  time.time     while time.time  starttime lt 10          queue.put1     queue.putbla bla bla sentinal     queue.join  codepre  pThe issue Im running into is that my worker pool cannot consume and process the codequeuecode as fast as the main thread insert values into it. So after some period of time, the Queue is so unwieldy that it pops a MemoryError. p  pAn obvious solution would be to simply add a wait check in the producer to stall it from putting any more values into the queue. Something along the lines ofp  precodewhile time.time  starttime lt 10      queue.put1     while queue.qsize gt somesize         time.sleep.1 queue.putbla bla bla sentinal queue.join  codepre  pHowever, because of the funky nature of the program, Id like to dump everything in the Queue to a file for later processing. But Without being able to temporarily lock the queue, the worker cant consume everything in it as the producer is constantly filling it back up with junk  conceptually anyway. After numerous tests it seems that at some point one of the locks wins but usually the one adding to the queue. p  pEdit Also, I realize itd be possible to simply stop the producer and consume it from that thread... but that makes the Single Responsibility guy in me feel sad, as the producer is a Producer, not a Consumer. p  h3Edith3  pAfter looking through the source of codeQueuecode, I came up with this p  precodedef dumpqueueq     q.rlock.acquire     try         res  []         while not q.empty             res.appendq.recv             q.sem.release         return res     finally         q.rlock.release     codepre  pHowever, Im too scared to use it I have no idea if this is correct or not.

Ive installed NUnit and Moq, and created a test class which looks like thisp  precodeusing System using System.Collections.Generic using System.Linq using System.Text using ChatProj using NUnit.Framework using ChatProj.Controllers using Moq using Microsoft.AspNet.SignalR using Microsoft.AspNet.SignalR.Hubs using ChatProj.DAL using ChatProj.ServiceLayer using System.Threading.Tasks  namespace ChatProj.Tests      [TestFixture]     public class Class1               [SetUp]         public void Setup                             [Test]     public void IsAdminCalledByAdminReturnTrue              UserService userService  new UserService         bool result  userService.IsAdmin           Assert.IsTrue result, Something is wrong.

Ive marked the parameters of the IsAdmin calls with  because Im not sure what to put there.p  pIve read about mocks, stubs, fakes and dummies, but the definitions are to abstract for me to really grasp. Ive found these definitions for examplep  precode  Dummy objects are passed around but never actually used. Usually they are just used to fill parameter lists.    Fake objects actually have working implementations, but usually take some shortcut which makes them not suitable for production an in memory database is a good example.    Stubs provide canned answers to calls made during the test, usually not responding at all to anything outside whats programmed in for the test. Stubs may also record information about calls, such as an email gateway stub that remembers the messages it sent, or maybe only how many messages it sent.    Mocks are objects preprogrammed with expectations which form a specification of the calls they are expected to receive. codepre  pAs Ive designed my test class, I would need some sort of substitution for my HubCallerContext. This is assuming Im testing the IsAdmin method the right way.p  pSo my questions are p  ul lipAm I testing the IsAdmin method in a good way pli lipHow would I practically make the tests work Do I use a mock, and in that case, could you show how I would implement that, or point me in the right direction  a hrefhttpsgithub.comSignalRSignalRblobmastersrcMicrosoft.AspNet.SignalR.CoreHubsHubCallerContext.cs relnofollow titleHere is how the HubCallerContext works for refrence.Here is how the HubCallerContext works for refrence.apli ul
Negative 1828 pWe have a Delphi SOAP service which needs to be SSLenabled.  I opted to use an IIS ARR reverse proxy to do SSL offloading for ease of configuration compared to OpenSSL and manual certificate  passphrase management.  ARR works, but it adds an insane amount of overhead...  Response time went from strongunder 2 seconds to 19 secondsstrong for 18 service requests about 60Kb compressed total.p  pI added timestamp logging to client amp server for when messages are both sent and received.  It shows about 1 second added to each request routing through ARR between sending from the client and receipt by the service.  The response is routed back very quickly, only the request routing via ARR is slow see image below.p  pHow can I trace the source of overhead  Is ARR not suited to this use case  I tried tweaking and disabling most settings, including caching.  I tried different hosts with clean IIS setups, including a production Windows Server 2012.  SSL itself is not the overhead, just having an ARR HTTP reverse proxy causes the delay.p  precodeltxml version1.0 encodingUTF8gt ltconfigurationgt     ltsystem.webServergt         ltrewritegt             ltrulesgt                 ltrule nameReverseProxyInboundRule1 stopProcessingtruegt                     ltmatch url. gt                     ltaction typeRewrite urlhttplocalhost8987R1 gt                 ltrulegt             ltrulesgt         ltrewritegt     ltsystem.webServergt ltconfigurationgt codepre  pRequest amp response samples from Fiddlerp  ul lia hrefhttpsdrive.google.comfiled0BzULbx5YjhvM3R4TVdHUW5PVDAedituspsharingRaw HTTP Requestali lia hrefhttpsdrive.google.comfiled0BzULbx5YjhvY1MzTWhXWU1kbk0edituspsharingRaw HTTP Responseali ul  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comrk4H3.png altClient and server timestamps gridp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comNh0yW.png altI0IS Tracing shows overhead from ARRp

Negative 1828 pstrongBackgroundstrongp  pI wrote a previous servlet that created dynamic webpages where it would read and write to a MySQL database. When I would read from it, I stored the result in a ResultSet, then displayed this information. Everything worked and I was told I should rewrite it using JSPs and JSTLs. To do this, in my servlet, I created a ResultSet and stored each columns result in a separate ArrayList. In my JSP, Im trying to iterate through the ArrayLists, however, the webpage is blank. Since Im using NetBeans, it normally will indicate any errors, but there seem to be none, so Im guessing theres either a logical error or a runtime error which doesnt exactly narrow it down. Ive tried simply printing the size of an ArrayList but even that isnt displaying My guess is either the ArrayList is never populated or its not properly being sent to the JSP. p  pTo note, my database is populated and I am able to write to it. Ive looked throughout various websites to see if anything can help but nothing has so far.

Negative 1828 pIm working on PhoneGapping a mobile web app I wrote from the ground up, and Im wondering what everyones thoughts are on progressive enhancement p  pRight now, the PhoneGap app is just pointing at our domain, so whatever code is on the server is whats being run. Id like to keep it this way as much as possible, but I was wondering if there was some way to detect if the viewer is coming through PhoneGap or not and then enable other functionality based on that e.g. local contacts, push notifications.p  pI know PhoneGap requires the phonegap.js file to be present, and it seems that including that acrosstheboard is going to cause some trouble with nonPhonegap users, so any thoughts here would be excellent.

Nowhere near LocationClient API quality.p  pThe app is supposed to monitor your movement through streets frequently, eg. update every second high battery use, not a problem to my client and do something when you reach certain locations. p  pIf I use Google Play API and LocationClient, its really working well. But thats only on Nexus4 or some nonChinese Android device.p  pIm asking if anyone know a library that can give better results than straight forward use of LocationManager, or a solution how to use LocationManager to improve resultsp
Negative 1828 pThis is pretty basic but stumbling block on picking up MVC coming from Web Forms of coursep  pIf a codeLayout.cshtmlcode has an optional sidebar as a Partial View, how do you get the Controller to pass the codeViewModelcode to it say, codeBlogPostscode without having to include it on all of the Controllers Page  View callsp  pI appreciate the Controllers are where we need to construct Models not inside Views, Partial or otherwise and that any Partial View will inherit the Model from its parent handy. But sometimes the parent page has its own codeViewModelcode eg. codeSearchResultscode  and although I could turn it around by passing the sidebar codeBlogPostscode into every View and only adding the the codeSearchResultscode for that page, am still stuck with same problem  how to selectively pass potential and multiple Models into parent and partial Views.p  pSo we could put any additional Models in the codeViewBagcode and then pull them out in any Partials, and this maybe the best solution, but seems messy and not sure if theyd remain strongly typed. Or is the solution to use an additional Partial View Controller In which case how you do it, because I get a null Object on the codeforeachcode in codeDefaultSideBar1.cshtmlcode and debug shows that the codeadditional DefaultSideBar1code is not running at all so not surprising its model doesnt get injectedp  pCurrent example route in codeHomeController.cscodep  precode[HttpGet]     public ActionResult SearchResultsstring searchText              ViewBag.Title  Search Results         ListltWebResultgt searchData  new ListltWebResultgt          generate searchData etc...         return ViewsearchData      codepre  pCurrent codeSearchResults.cshtmlcode which uses a codeLayout.cshtmlcodep  precode  model IEnumerableltBing.WebResultgt      ... etc etc....     section DefaultSidebar1              Html.PartialDefaultSidebar1      codepre  pAnticipated additional current controller for sidebar which loads but not overridden in controller so with null Object Refp  precode [HttpGet]     public ActionResult DefaultSideBar1              return Viewdb.BlogPosts.ToList      codepre  pcodeCurrent DefaultSideBar1.cshtmlcodep  precode  model IEnumerableltProj.MVC.SPQ.DataEntities.BlogPostgt     ltulgt         foreach var item in Model                      ltligtHtml.ActionLinkitem.Title, Details, new  iditem.ID ltligt              ltulgt codepre

This is essentially a reverse RANGE search. p  pThere are other fields that I am querying, so this should be included in the weighting, this also cant be in fq, since if the item doesnt match this criteria, there are others that it may match. p  pSo far, I was able to assemble this function queryp  precode prboostsum  ifandqueryedismax vprhighmax[8 TO ] ,queryedismax vprhighmin[ TO 8],5,0,  ifandqueryedismax vprmedmax[8 TO ] ,queryedismax vprmedmin[ TO 8],3,0,  ifandqueryedismax vprlowmax[8 TO ] ,queryedismax vprlowmin[ TO 8],1,0,   codepre  pWhere 8 is the price that I will be passing it, basically this checks to see if the price is in any of the ranges, and if it is, I will get back a value, 5 for high, 3 for med, 1 for low.

Additionally, if I tried to boost on it, I get back Infinite Recursion detected parsing query prhighmax[8 TO ]p  pHas anyone run into something like this before Any ideas p  pAlso, I have control of the data going on, so I can easily massage it to represent the range in a different way if this would make resolution easier. p  pThanks in advancep

Its like the Linqd element wasnt a reference to the object, but its copy, so the codeIncreasecode method increases only the local objects properties, but not the one in the collection.p  pI am at loss here, because I have never encountered such a behaviour.p  pHere comes the codep  pstrongUseCounterstrongp  precodepublic class UseCounterltTgt      public T Element  get private set      public int TotalCount  get private set      public int Count  get private set      public bool Useful  get set       public UseCounterT element              this.Element  element         this.Count  0         this.TotalCount  0         this.Useful  true           public void IncreaseCounter              this.Count         this.TotalCount           public void DecreaseCounter              ifthis.Count  0                      throw new ArgumentOutOfRangeExceptionCount cannot be lower than 0                   this.Count       codepre  pstrongDispenserstrongp  precodeprivate readonly object elementLocker  new object     private IEnumerableltUseCounterltTgtgt elements      public IEnumerableltTgt Elements               get  return elements.Selecte gt e.Element            public int FinishedCount                get                      lock elementLocker                              return elements.Wheree gt e.Useful  false.Count                                  public int CurrentlyWorkingCount              get                       lock elementLocker                              return elements.Wheree gt e.Count gt 0.Count                                 public DispenserIEnumerableltTgt elements              this.elements  elements             .Distinct             .Selecte gt new UseCounterltTgte           public T Get              lockelementLocker                      var lCount  elements                 .Wheree gt e.Useful  true                 .Selecte gt e.Count.Min              var lTCount  elements                 .Wheree gt e.Useful  true                 .Wheree gt e.Count  lCount                 .Selecte gt e.TotalCount.Min              var el  elements                 .Wheree gt e.Useful  true                 .Firste gt e.Count  lCount ampamp e.TotalCount  lTCount              el.IncreaseCounter              return el.Element                    public void ReportT element, bool successful              lockelementLocker                      var el  elements                 .Firste gt e.Element  element             el.DecreaseCounter              ifel.Useful  true ampamp successful  true                              el.Useful  false                            codepre

Negative 1828 pIm working with push notifications. I read through Apples programming guide that in case of Remote or Local notifications, applicationdidFinishLaunchingWithOptions is called and hold the payload in the launchOptions. From there in case of notifications I can respond to the push. Im testing push on two devices. One that issues the push and the second receives it. I ran the app on both devices and i kept one turned on and the second exited the app to home screen and closed the phone to wait for a notification i didnt close the app on xcode though. I issues a push and i received it on the receiver device, however using NSLog, it seems that applicationdidFinishLaunchWithOptions is not being called when the push is opened and only once at application first start. I didnt provide code because there no much added to test that other than the push which is working fine. What could be wrong is that the right way to respond to notifications opened when the app is in the backgroundp

In other words, does a serverside integration between Netty and 0MQ make sense If not, why If so, howp

However, I want to be able to perform a command like World.update, which automatically updates all the Entities, giving them the opportunity to move, attack, open doors, build barricades, ... The world would then iterate through all the entities, calling their respective update functions.p  pI found out from a previous attempt, that it causes problems to store a reference to a world in the entity class, and storing an arrayvector of entities inside the world class.p  pSo here are my actual questionsbrbr  How can I design my classes in order to have a meaningful relationship between Entities and the Worldsbr  Where do I put my references  directly into function calls, maybe thats going to cost performance, I guessp  pEdit Please note, that Im not expecting code samples, I rather want to write the code myself. What would help me most would be hints such as which class should hold which variables.p  pThank you all for your timep

We cant always sort by release date either because we found this to be unreliable some executables have a release date that doesnt match with the version. So wed like to somehow combine these values into a sorting that takes both into account. In the example above, its rather clear that the versioning switched around 2011 to a lower numbering system. I was thinking about doing a minimum interval lets say 1 year to distinguish different groups by their version and then to sort by their version, but Im not entirely sure if this will result in a sorting that makes total sense to the user for a user, these patterns in versioning are not that hard to see. Is there anything that I should look into for these kind of sortingsp

Negative 1828 pThe app Im creating requires a number of images to be pulled from our server, and displayed on a page. The user can go into several different categories, and each will have their own images. The problem is after going to 23 categories depending on how many images are in those categories in a row, the app has no more memory and cannot display the Bitmaps without crashing. p  pWhat Id like to be able to do is clear the memory every time the user goes to a new category so that the old categorys images wont be stored in memory anymore, freeing up space for the relevant categorys images. Im not sure if this is a good way to do it, or even how to do it if it was.p  pIf anyone has a better solution let me know. One idea that was thrown around was loading only 20 images at once, and waiting until the user scrolls to the bottom before loading more, however since our customers are paying to have their images on the app, that would cause less traffic to certain images, so this is not the ideal solution.

Negative 1828 pI am designing a convenient config object which will load config values from a file.  In order to make sure there are sane defaults, the programmer can state for each kind of value what type it is, and a default value.

For example, consider the following config file httpd.confp  precodeport    8080 htdocs  ROOT prelude true codepre  pand a config object in mainp  precodeint main    Config confhttpd.conf,     port, ConfigINT, 80,     htdocs, ConfigSTRING, default,     preload, ConfigBOOLEAN, false codepre  pThe above code would load the file and verify that port is in fact an integer, it would load htdocs , and it would find that prelude in the file does not match any registered value in the config, and emit an errorp  pline 3 undefined configuration item preludep  pI could implement the above with an old C variadic parameters, but those are not typesafe.

However, I suspect it could be answered by equally vague strategies of approaching these issues that are instructive and helpful.p  pI have coded a simulator which has a main, parallelized loop iterating through parameter values, loading them to the model and running them codencode times. p  pstrongThe issuestrong while the code generally works well for smaller problem dimensions, it fails at a significant frequency at higher dimensions particularly higher codencode most parameter values execute fine and output is produced, but once in a while there is no file produced. The post processing then fails because of missing files.p  pstrongWhat I knowstrong Rerunning the function, different parameter values are effected, so this is not due to invalid parameter values, but seemingly a random failure. There have also been some runs without any problems. There was once an error message about codefailure to allocate vector of size xyzcode.p  pstrongWhat I triedstrong codetracebackcode seems to focus on the failure at the end of the sim a symptom but doesnt find the real cause. I also tried adding a codewhilecode loop conditional on the existence of the output file, what would rerun the parameter value if it failed see below, commented out. This seemed to help a little, but not completely.p  pThe above leads me to suspect some threads crash somehow, and then fail to output any of the parameters assigned to it.p  pstrongQuestionsstrong What strategies would you use to diagnose this issue What methods can one implement to make such a simulation more robust to errors diagnosed or otherwise What kind of operations might I be doing what can cause such failuresp  pstrongSketch of the Sim.

Negative 1828 pMy issue is converting text within a field to a specific class for purposes of launching different Activities. My XML file will be expanded into two different classes.

I could use a master list [matched via Ids to classes in a second list thats coded directly in], but that would go against the purpose of making the XML file in the first place.p  pIve tried searching everywhere for an answer its not really serializing objects although Im guessing its considered strongdeserializingstrong XML into two objects, in this case, but its more of a problem of converting a text to a class similar to in the AndroidManifest xml file, where an Activity is defined. I also couldnt find the code that parses the AndroidManifest file either, so no leads there.p
Negative 1828 pI am relatively new to programming in general  the last formal object oriented programming class I took was my freshman year of college my jargon may not be accurate. So please, bear with me. If this question should be asked in a different area such as the C forum, please let me know. p  pBasically, the premise is this in one solution I have two projects, a Windows Form Application and a Web Application. My Windows Form Application will be a simple GUI it will get more complicated later but I wanted to started more simply to start with a label prompting the user to input some text, a TextBox for the user to input the text, and a Submit button. Once the Submit button is pressed I want to pass whatever was typed into the TextBox to appear in a TextBox on a given webpage this webpage will be part of a Web Application that already exists but for now I am just using a local host for debugging and getting concepts down.p  pI have already designed the form for the Windows Form Application and designed the web page again simple with a label stating Text Entered from GUI and a TextBox. So now Im stuck. Ive tried a couple of different things and tried searching for a similar problems but no such luck. I thought that I could implement a using namespace with the name of my Windows Form project in the aspx.cs page but when I run, it doesnt recognize the method I use...so I tried putting the method directly in the .aspx page but it doesnt like the namespace Ive given asked if I was missing an assembly reference...which I am not.... p  pI feel like I am making this more difficult than it needs to be and I am not sure where to go from here. If someone needs to look at my code I will post it  I would post it now but it is a bit of a hassle. The computer I am programming on is not allowed to be hooked up to the Internet, nor am I allowed to use devices such as thumb drives, so I will have to type it in by hand. However, I am willing to do this if it means I can get some answers Again, I am here to learn and seek advice so any help would be GREATLY appreciated Also, a speedy response is idealp  pOh I am using Visual Studio 2012, .NET Framework 4.5 and my Windows Form Application is written in C.p

Negative 1828 pI am writing an iPhone app in Swift. I have a dictionary that maps String keys to [MyClass] values. I have a function that does the followingp  precodefunc addItemobject MyClass gt Bool      if self.dict[object.name]  nil          self.dict[object.name]  [MyClass]           var objectList  self.dict[object.name]       Other code here that doesnt matter       objectList.appendobject     return true  codepre  pThe problem here is that when I reach the return statement, objectList has a count of 1, but self.dict[object.name] has a count of 0. That is to say that objectList is actually a copy of the array in the dictionary rather than the same array.p  pI guess that makes some sense, since arrays are value types in Swift, but its pretty inconvenient. Does anyone have a good solution for this Can I force the return from the dictionary to a reference a la inout Or do I need to create my own list class to wrap arrays with or save modified arrays back to the dictionaryp
Negative 1828 pIve started using Aptana Studio 3 for my Ruby project.  it has a nice autocomplete option. you can type someObject. , and a list shows up with all available methods.  however I noticed strongit doesnt list the right methodsstrong. some methods are missing, while some methods in the list do not exist at all. ie for String, it doesnt list chars, chomp, upcase, etc. while it lists asjson, which isnt a String method. and for imported libraries like Tk, it doesnt list methods at all.  how can I configure this I understand it has something to do with Bundles I couldnt find a Ruby bundle. I searched Aptana Studios website, and other question here in StackOverflow and couldnt find anything.p  pif this program cant do that for Ruby, what other programs can I usep
Negative 1828 pI finished the configuration of centreonnagios on FANcentos for my company.p  pim looking for importing the usr of the Active Directory of this company, using the centreon interface and make it easier for employee to connect. i didnt make the installation myself, i took this project along the way. from what i know the installation have been made on a virtual machine and then transfer on a physical server.p  pThe probleme is, i can connect with the AD on the server using ldapsearch from openldap but centreon cant. on the other hand, on the VM, both centreon and ldapsearch can. both centreons ldap conf, on the vm and on the server, are the same so i dont think the problem came from here.p  pthe centreonLDAP.class.php is a little bit big so im not putting it here, but since the vm is working and both have the same centreonLDAP.class.php i dont think it would be usefull. p  pif anybody had an idea about what could block centreons ldapbind but not openldap.  Since openldap work on the server im pretty sure it cant be a firewall problem and since the parameters on both vm and server are the same i doubt the probleme came from centreon.p  phoping i have been clear enough, do not hesitate to ask me for more.p  pThank you and sorry for my english.p  hr  pldapsearchworking p  precodeldapsearch H ldapltIPACTIVEDIRECTORY389 b ltBASEDNgt D ltDNADMINgt w ltMDPgt LLL ampsamAccountNameltUSERgtobjectClassusersamAccountType805306368 x codepre  pvarlogcentreonldapsearch.logp  precode[17092014 1519]LDAP Connect  trying url  ldapltIPADgt389 [17092014 1519]LDAP Connect  Credentials  ltDNADMINgt [17092014 1519]LDAP Connect  Bind  Cant contact LDAP server [17092014 1519]LDAP Connect  connection error [17092014 1554] LDAP Search  XML Output  codepre  piptables L i dont think the problem could be from here since the openldap command still work but anyway iptables Lp  precodeChain INPUT policy ACCEPT target     prot opt source               destination   Chain FORWARD policy ACCEPT target     prot opt source               destination   Chain OUTPUT policy ACCEPT target     prot opt source               destination codepre  phere is a bit of the php code in centreonLDAP.class.php, if this can helpp  precode   Connect to the first LDAP server     return bool   public function connect      foreach thisgtldapHosts as ldap          port           if issetldap[info][port]              port   . ldap[info][port]                  if issetldap[info][usessl] ampamp ldap[info][usessl]  1                                                                                                      url  ldaps . ldap[host] . port .           else              url  ldap . ldap[host] . port .                   thisgtdebugLDAP Connect  trying url   . url         thisgtsetErrorHandler         thisgtds  ldapconnecturl         ldapsetoptionthisgtds, LDAPOPTREFERRALS, 0         protocolversion  3         if issetldap[info][protocolversion]              protocolversion  ldap[info][protocolversion]                  ldapsetoptionthisgtds, LDAPOPTPROTOCOLVERSION, protocolver                                                                                        sion         if issetldap[info][usetls] ampamp ldap[info][usetls]  1                                                                                                      thisgtdebugLDAP Connect  use tls             ldapstarttlsthisgtds                  restoreerrorhandler         thisgtldap  ldap         bindResult  thisgtrebind         if bindResult              return true                  thisgtdebugLDAP Connect  connection error          return false      Close LDAP Connexion   public function close      thisgtsetErrorHandler     ldapclosethisgtds     restoreerrorhandler      Rebind with the default binddn     return If the connection is good   public function rebind      thisgtsetErrorHandler     if issetthisgtldap[info][binddn] ampamp               thisgtldap[info][binddn]   ampamp               issetthisgtldap[info][bindpass] ampamp               thisgtldap[info][bindpass]            thisgtdebugLDAP Connect  Credentials   . thisgtldap[info]                                                                                        [binddn]         bindResult  ldapbindthisgtds, thisgtldap[info][binddn]                                                                                        , thisgtldap[info][bindpass]      else          thisgtdebugLDAP Connect  Credentials  anonymous         bindResult  ldapbindthisgtds          if bindResult          thisgtlinkId  thisgtldap[id]         thisgtloadSearchInfothisgtldap[id]         restoreerrorhandler         return true          thisgtdebugLDAP Connect  Bind   . ldaperrorthisgtds     restoreerrorhandler     return false  codepre

Negative 1828 pI noticed that the AngularUI have discontinued their UISelect2 directive in favor of the new UISelect with multiple themes  select2, bootstrap, selectize.p  pIt looks like thisp  precodeltuiselect multiple ngmodelmultipleDemo.colors themeselect2 ngdisableddisabled stylewidth 300pxgt     ltuiselectmatch placeholderSelect colors...gtitemltuiselectmatchgt     ltuiselectchoices repeatcolor in availableColors  filterselect.searchgt         color     ltuiselectchoicesgt ltuiselectgt  ltpgtSelected multipleDemo.colorsltpgt codepre  pInitially my selectbox is supposed to be empty but ready to take typed characters, that is a string of at least 4 characters and then make an API call to retrieve a list of suggested values which are to populate the box. One value will then be chosen, and searching should be repeated as needed.p  pFirst I tried codewatchcodeing the codengmodelcode which in this case is codemultipleDemo.colorscode using this example from the demos. The API call never occurred and then I realized why. The actual model is not changed at all because it only changes when a selection is made my selectbox is empty so nothing can be selected.p  pMy conclusion is that I should be able to codewatchcode whats been added as filter, namely codefilter select.searchcode.p  pDoes anyone know how am I supposed to use that one in my controllerp  pThisp  precodescope.watchselect.search, functionnewVal     alertnewVal  codepre  pdoesnt work.p  pEDIT For anyones reference, see this short discussion a hrefhttpsgithub.comangularuiuiselectissues30 relnofollowIs it possible to add support for custom query function like the select2ap  pEDIT 2p  pI solved this by using codeemitcode from within the directive so the value is available in my controller now. But now Id like to know how can I override this part of the directive so the directive itself can be left intact so it doesnt break in future updatesp

Negative 1828 pI just blew a few days tracking down a bug in a python script unknown to me, web2py used a different root directory from what i was expecting, leading to a file read to fail silently. Thus when run from command line, code was fine, but when run from web, code failed. Having finally tracked down the culprit I can just fix the silent fail which is in a library, openCV in this case but a smarter detective would have seen the fail in some sort of system log , if such exists. Then , no matter where the silent fail is, I still see it and dont have to painstakingly track down the fail.br So  is there some sort of global error logfile for linux that logs such things as fileread errors And yes I know there is python specific error logging but the question still holds. e.g. if i have a complex project with some python, some C, some whatever, and someone somewhere is silently failing, a systemwide error log would  be of immense help.p

Negative 1828 pIm currently learning how to use the codeautoconfcodecodeautomakecode toolchain.  I seem to have a general understanding of the workflow here  basically you have a codeconfigure.accode script which generates an executable codeconfigurecode file.  The generated codeconfigurecode script is then executed by the end user to generate codeMakefilecodes, so the program can be builtinstalled.p  pSo the installation for a typical enduser is basicallyp  precode.configure make make install make clean codepre  pOkay, now heres where Im confusedp  pAs a developer, Ive noticed that the autogenerated configure script sometimes wont run, and will error withp  precodeconfig.status error cannot find input file somedirMakefile.in  codepre  pThis confuses me, because I thought the configure script is supposed to emgenerateem the codeMakefile.incode.  So Googling around for some answers, Ive discovered that this can be fixed with an codeautogen.shcode script, which basically resets the state of the codeautoconfcode environment.  A typical codeautogen.shcode script would be something likep  precodeaclocal  ampamp automake addmissing  ampamp autoconf codepre  pOkay fine.  But as an enduser whos downloaded countless tarballs throughout my life, Ive emneverem had to use an codeautogen.shcode script.  All I did was uncompress the tarball, and do the usual configuremakemake installmake clean routine.p  pBut as a developer whos now emusingem codeautoconfcode, it seems that codeconfigurecode doesnt actually run unless you run codeautogen.shcode first.  So I find this very confusing, because I thought the enduser shouldnt have to run codeautogen.shcode. p  pSo why do I have to run codeautogen.shcode first  in order for the configure script to find codeMakefile.incode  Why doesnt the configure script simply generate itp

Do you guys know how to solve this problem p  pstrongEDITstrongp  pAlexey made a good point p  blockquote   pWhat exactly do you want to happen if e.g. A is Double, B is Long, and   C is Bytep blockquote  pWell codeCcode needs to be passed as a type parameter because otherwise the compiler doesnt know what codeCcode is, so I would like codeAcode and codeBcode to be converted to codeCcode. But what I really want to happen is to never lose information. So If for example, codeAcode is an codeIntcode and codeBcode is a codeFloatcode, I want codeAcode to be converted to codeFloatcode and merge both codeAcode and codeBcode into a collection codeCcodecodeFloatcode. p  pOf course this hierarchy does not exist, does it Thats why I need to abstract the result type into codeCcode and manually pass it as a type parameter. p

Negative 1828 pI have a set of coordinates x, y, zx, y which describe intensities z at coordinates x, y. For a set number of these intensities at different coordinates, I need to fit a 2D Gaussian that minimizes the mean squared error.  The data is in numpy matrices and for each fitting session I will have either 4, 9, 16 or 25 coordinates. Ultimately I just need to get the central position of the gaussian x0, y0 that has smallest MSE. All of the examples that I have found use scipy.optimize.curvefit but the input data they have is over an entire mesh rather than a few coordinates. Any help would be appreciated. p

Negative 1828 pWe are building a RESTful web application in java using Spring security and OAuth2.p  pEverything is working as expected and Im starting to understand the basics of access and refresh tokens, but there are still some inclarities and by browsing the internet, I get even more confused by different viewpoints.p  pThe way our implementation works right nowp  pIn springsecurity we can only have 1 valid refresh token for a given user at a time.  We have a validity period for refresh tokens of 300 seconds 5 minutes. Every time we ask a new refresh token for the user, the same refresh token is returned but the validity time is not reset.p  pThat way, a new refresh token is asked in the background every 302 seconds and this refresh token is used to request the access tokens that are put in the authorization headers of the REST calls.p  pThis works ok most of the time, but if requests are executed in between the 300 and 302 seconds where the first refresh token is expired and the second not yet returned, we get an authentication error and the user is logged out of the application.p  pI read a lot of different advice on the internetp  ul lipThe first one is to request a new refresh token for every web service call. This one we didnt consider since we have to provide the credentials usernamepassword to obtain the refresh token for every single WS request.pli lipSecond one is to increase the validity period of a refresh token to 10 hours instead of 5 minutes. This would solve or problem for most of the cases. But there is still the chance the user is logged out after the expiration time of the refresh token and before he has a new one.pli ul  pWhat is the best approach to solve this issue. Is a validity time of 10 hours safe Is it recommended to use a new refresh token for every single ws callp

Negative 1828 pI am new to win32 programming.I am intercepting an application from my application using codeMadHookccode, by hooking codedllcode funceions. I am hooking the codeExtTextOutWcode function to get the text used for display in the application. Hookign codeExtTextOutWcode gives me near about all the data of the hooked application. But my requirement is that, i need to know that the data coming in codeExtTextOutWcode is going to set to which windowcontrol e.g. EditBox, Label,Button,List,combo,Frame,Tab etc., so that i can process it according to my requirements. In some places i need to bypass the data of labels from my process.       My problem is that, in my hook i am getting parameters of codeExtTextOutWcode. One of them is codeHDCcode , i know that if we call codeWindowFromDChdccode , will return the window name . But in some cases it returns codenullcode.

But no one resolved my problem.p  pOne of the ways i tried to determine control is that, i searched the methods called exactly before  codeExtTextOutWcode of each control, hooked them and assigned a control name for the coming codeExtTextOutWcode method.But some methods are same for more than one control, which causes the problem to differentiate between controls. Also doing this seems too lengthy and not able to get different method for each control  which calls before codeExtTextOutWcode of that control.I searched for these methods in codeUser32.dllcode and codeGDI32.dllcode.  So does anyone has a different  suggestion or correction in my way. Any help would be appreciated.  So can anyone help me out to differentiate controls. Thank you in advance.p

Negative 1828 pI have an SSIS package where I need to execute a MERGE statement with an Execute SQL Task. I need to do this both on an Oracle DB and a SQL Server 2012 DB. My question is, how can I get the number of rows affected as a ResultSet so I can save it on a variable in the SSIS package I dont need to know if updated or inserted, and I dont want to create a procedure on Oracle because the MERGE is dynamic and calculated in the package through expressions in variables. I just want to get the value of the rows affected back. p  pP.S. If I cant use the Execute SQL Task, can i at lease use a Script to run the MERGE The problem is, from what I read, that ExecuteNonQuery on Oracle does not return the rows affected with a MERGE. And I couldnt find any information for SQL Server. Can anyone helpp  pThanks in advance.p  pUPDATE I just checked a script with ExecuteNonQuery for SQL Server, and it did return the number or rows affected. It would however be better if I could avoid the script and use the Execute SQL Task, but how do I get the rows affected as a ResultSetp

Negative 1828 pI have an AppEngine app using the Google API Python Client to access the Fusion Tables API over OAuth.  When trying to run UPDATE commands, the API client is putting my whole SQL statement into the query string in the URL.p  pSo when I write a SQL statement like this...p  precodeUPDATE lttable IDgt SET ltcolumngt  some really long piece of text... WHERE ROWID  1 codepre  p...I get an API call like thisp  precodePOST httpswww.googleapis.comfusiontablesv1querysqlUPDATElttable IDgtSETltcolumngt3D27somereallylongpieceoftext...27WHEREROWID3D27127ampaltjson codepre  pAll this works fine for most things.  But Im encountering errors when writing more than 1,500 characters depending on how many of those are special characters I have to escape to that cell.  a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions11952166whatarethetechnicallimitationswhenusingfusiontablesThe answer to another questiona says the limit to the number of characters in a cell is 1,000,000.  Im assuming this may be because the URL is getting just way too long for something in the pipeline from AppEngine to the Fusion Tables API servers, maybe kind of like the issue addressed in a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions9199378limittoquerylengthinfusiontablesthis questiona.p  pWith other APIs, Im used to sending parameters in form data for POST requests not the query string, which keeps the URL a manageable size.  But the a hrefhttpsdevelopers.google.comfusiontablesdocsv1referencequerysql relnofollowFusion Tables API docsa seem to suggest that the query string is the proper place and that nothing should be sent in the request body.  The API client seems to be dutifully following this pattern and in fact using that as the default behavior for ALL Google APIs.p  pSo my question is threefoldp  ol liDoes anyone know if the URL can get too long as I suspect is happeningli liIs the query string really the only place to send the SQL statement or will if I find a way to include it in the request body will the API accept thatli liIf the query string really is the only way and it really can get too long, is there another way to post large strings to fusion table cellsli ol

Negative 1828 pIs it advisable to implement a extrinsic lock as an attrubite of a class that will be shared between different threadsp  pFor example I would like to have a implementation like thisp  precodepublic class Order       private final LinkedListltFoodgt order     private final int orderNum     private static int idGen     private final Lock lock     private final Condition isDone      public Order           TODO Autogenerated constructor stub         this.order  new LinkedListltgt         this.orderNum  idGen         this.lock   new ReentrantLock         this.isDone  lock.newCondition           public static Order createOrder         return new Order           public void addFood food         synchronized food              order.addfood                    public LinkedListltFoodgt getOrder          return order           public int getOrderNum          return orderNum           public synchronized boolean isEmpty         return this.order.isEmpty       codepre  pThen assume that I have two threads called Customer and Cook. Cook will try to empty the LinkedList of the shared Order object, while Customer will constantly check whether his order has been fulfilled, e.g become empty. My purpose is to use a lock inside shared Order object. When Cook finish his job, he would call order.getIsDone.signal to awake Customer thread awaiting with the same condition, e.g  whileorder.isEmpty order.getIsDone.await p  pThe reason that I came up with this idea is that I want to share the same lock between two threads while bounding to a certain Order object. However, since Order object is shared between different threads, it might have concurrent issue. So, I am not sure this impelementation is a wise choice. p  pAn alternative I can think of would be replacing order.getIsDone.await with yield, but it will cause some performance loss while its much simplier. p

Negative 1828 ul liI am working on a SpringMVC application in which I would like to implement chat functionality provided by Cometd. Now, in this project, there are various groups each with uniqueidPrimary key. Whenever a group is created I would like to create a channel and then when a member sends a message inside the group, then the message is sent through that channel so it goes to the groupMembers only. No persistence of chat messages is required,just that messages should be pushed to all those who are online. ul liMy main motivation behind selecting cometd was as I read there is a lot of documentation and help, but as I see, there are hardly good examples on net and the documentation on the project website is obscured with too much technical details.

The chairs in each row have numbers from 1 to 100. Write a program that will calculate the length of the shortest path from the front to the back of the hall. Each chair is 1 unit wide and each row is 1 unit deep from the front of a chair to the front of the chair behind it. It is not possible to move diagonally. You may start in front of any gap in the front row and end behind any gap in the last row. You always walk through the middle of a gap. Illustrated is the shortest path through a hall, with five rows of chairs. In the illustration the hall is only 10 chairs wide instead of 100. The first number in the input will contain the number n  the number of rows. The next n lines will have two numbers, separated by a space, indicating where the gaps are. Example Input 5 3 6 2 8 4 5 7 8 3 10 p  pI think I have an efficient algorithm that I think will work, but Im not sure how to implement it into Java.p  pWhat I want to do is break up each choice into a search tree so for instance if the user input wasp  pnumber of rows 3p  pSpaces  4 7           2 9          8 11p  pMake 2 search treesp  precode              4                               7                    2           9                     2           9      8   11      8   11             8      11     8      11 codepre  pAnd then find  the path where the difference between each node is the smallest  So in this case the shortest path would be in the second tree 798 with the total distance being 5 798 So my question is then p  ol lipIs this acceptable algorithm given the problempli lipHow would I implement either this algorithm or another in java pli ol  pJuanLopes Take for instance this example 0s represent a space.p  pRow6 0 2 3 4 5 6 0 8 9p  pRow5 0 2 3 4 5 6 0 8 9p  pRow4 1 2 3 0 5 6 0 8 9p  pRow3 1 2 3 0 5 6 0 8 9p  pRow2 1 2 3 0 5 6 0 8 9p  pRow1 1 2 3 0 5 6 0 8 9p  pWhat I understand from your algorithm is that it looks at each row individually. So through rows 14 the distance between each space to the next row is equal but when you get to row 5 if you went down the path where all the 4s were missing it would take you longer compared to going down the path with all the 7s missing, does your solution take that into account  p

Negative 1828 blockquote   pI am using kerberos for authentication and ldap for authorization.   My kerberos authentication is working fine. Problem I am facing is ldap is called before kerberos returns username.

Negative 1828 pConsidering the following scenario p  pI have an MVC web application written in asp.net 4.5 that is using forms authentication. p  pFor authenticating the current user, I am calling a web service method which tells me if the login is valid and if it is I am setting the identity on the web application after getting the response from the web service. p  pMy problem now is that I want to be able to identify the user in both the MVC web application as well as on the backend services when the user places the calls, would prefer doing this from configuration if possible. p  pAnother concern is where should I create the session token and do session management Dont want my authentication method being called on every single request, so I suppose I need a session token caching mechanism and also dont want to set the credentials for the proxy on every request, if possible I want this to be done from configuration, is it possible using WIF and if so how p  pWhat would be considered a good approach on implementing thisp

Negative 1828 pFor some project, I need to store some short string in encrypted form. It would be ideal for the current purposes to encrypt it using itself.p  precode This would be the usual way result  AESENCRYPTstring, key   but I would like to do it this way result  AESENCRYPTstring, string codepre  pThe same string itself would be used as the keyp  pThe string is always some short text, like 20 characters of letters and numbers. This solution seems better to me than using any hash function, since hash could lead to collisions  different strings could potentially produce the same result, which is low probability, I know, but still not zero so I want to avoid that.p  pMy question is, is my approach safe Encoding the data using the data itself, does it lead to any security issue Would it mean that it could be easier to decrypt the result, if the attacker knows the fact it is produced by encrypting my way Thank you.p  pNote for the simplicity of the question I didnt mention several things which are not necessary to explain. Simply trust me, I know what I am doing. Im just asking if this approach could lead to any trouble.p

Negative 1828 pIm utilizing a Apache  modwsgi  django setup on Windows with python 2.7. It seems that the only setup that is possible on Windows for modwsgi is having 1 process with many child worker threads. Because of this, it seems that some work may be subject to GIL. Ive noticed that database requests dont appear to cause locks, but some python processing does cause lockingslowdown.p  pFor examplep  pIf Im processing a large xml file using lxml via soaplib, it causes massive slowdowns. Reading the documentation, it seems the solution to this is to use codeWSGIApplicationGroup GLOBALcode. Side note, does this even work in Windowsp  pIf Im doing a large list processing job via python natively that is CPU intensive, it also seems to slow other requests.p  pIm wondering if there is a general class of work that will cause djangopython to lock until its finished. And if so, what are some best practices to avoid these issuesp
Negative 1828 pI have been trying to migrate our on premise TFS to Visual Studio Online for a few months but never been able to successfully do a full migration.  I have tried various ways going from TFS 2012, upgrading to TFS 2013, creating a VM within Azure to migrate the data but whatever I do it runs to slow to migrate the data.  The migration keeps stopping at 445 changsets with a failure LabelTypeEntity2445 Error  OHSCM009 Error occurred while sync. TF400733 The request has been cancelled The request has exceeded request timeout, please try again.p  pAlso at what point can Im move the users to Visual Studio Online as its going to take weeks to migrate the source code and we cant enforce a code freeze for that period of time.  If the migration does run successfully can the migration be performed again to reflect any changes within the onpremise TFS and will this run quicker as its not migrating the entirety of TFS againp  pMany Thanksp

Negative 1828 pI am working on a project where an export to Excel functionality is required for a specific HTML table.  The tables style needs to be maintained.  Also, a metadata section needs to be added to the Excel not present in the html table and this section needs to be frozen.p  pI tried achieving this by parsing the html with JSoup and using Apache POI to create an excel file, but I could not find a way to retain the styling.  The values stored in the html style tag do not directly equate to any styles in POI.p  pBefore I started working on it, the application already had a function to export a table to excel by converting it to bytes and writing it with a FileOutPutStream and giving it an xls extension.  This allows the style to be maintained, but since it is technically not an xls formatted file, I am not able to read it in with POI and apply the freeze.  p  pIs there any way to either read in the file that the application already creates and apply the freeze, or convert the table into xls while maintaining the style and applying a freeze panep  pAlternately, if there is any way to have the table exported to a valid excel file with the styling maintained, I can then have POI read in that file and apply the freeze.p

Negative 1828 pIm having trouble detecting when a user has authenticated with FB, but then clicked cancel when asked for permissions.p  pWhats happening isp  p1 Application loads and checks the login status... user is unknown. Great.p  p2 User clicks Sign in button which calls FB.login with permissions for birthdate and address. User is shown the FB login dialog, enters their credentials, and then is taken to the permissions dialog.p  p3 They decide to cancel. The dialog closes and returns a status of unknown.p  p4 I refresh the page, status check runs again, user is now notauthorized.p  pIm assuming that this means the login portion at step 2 was successful because now I can even open another tab to FB and the user is logged in. This makes sense since the user was able to login and see the permissions dialog, but when they cancelled, why did they remain unknown when in fact they emareem known by FB at that pointp  pI tried to add another getLoginStatus as followsp  precodevar login  function     console.loglogging in user via FB...     var dfr  q.defer     FB.loginfunctionresponse          ifresponse.status  connected             console.log    user is connected                   ifresponse.status  notauthorized             console.log    user is not authorized                   ifresponse.status  unknown             console.log    user is unknown               if user is unknown, check that they REALLY are unknown             FB.getLoginStatusfunctionresponse                 console.logstatus response, response                                status.fbUser  response.status         dfr.resolveresponse     ,         scope email,publicprofile,userbirthday,         returnscopes true          return dfr.promise  codepre  p... but that only tells me that FB still claims to not know the user. When you refresh the page, BAM the initial login check says user is notauthorized. Just like children losing specialness as they grow into adults, when does a user go from unknown to notsounknownp  pI was intending on redirecting the user to either a permissions explanation page, or a registration page or something, but only if they come back from the login process as notauthorized. At least this tells me that FB knows the person, but they have not authorized my app with their account, so I can handle that separately to someone who is completely unknown.p  pHow do I get it to return notauthorized without having to refresh the page Is the user, from an FB perspective, unknown or notauthorized at the point between steps 2 and 3p  pa hrefhttpstackoverflow.coma210342072800116This answera to another SO question leads me to consider subscribing to FB events to detect that change, but I would have thought that the closing dialog, the extra getLoginStatus and any events would all say the same thing at this point. Ill have to try it out and report back.p  pa hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions11747956fbgetloginstatusneedspagerefreshedrq1This posta is close, but deals with two users and the new one getting replaced with the old one.

So why is it not widely implemented The only reason i could find is because its a little bit more complicated. And i heard say several times that MacTokens are not recommended, if the client is not 100 trusted, because the client has to store the secret. But where is the difference The client has to store a AuthorazationInformation anyway. In my opinion it strongdoesnt matterstrong wheter its a bearertoken or a macsecret. But what strongmakes a differencestrong is that the macsecret emrather than the bearertokenem is not submitted over the wire on every request.p  pSo can you tell me a sane reason why not using mactokens apart of having a litte more effort Am i missing something Or have i missunderstood the two token techniques.p  pThanks for reading and your help.p
Negative 1828 pOk, I have a really weird situation happening here. First I need to give some background. Im creating AI agents for a game that was made on the XNA engine. The way things are set up, people are supposed to use the agents framework to generate a .dll that the game then uses to load the agents when it runs.p  pI have access to the code of the game so I can see whats happening and at this point Im using someone elses agents as a starting point for my own. Recently, there were a few changes to the game and consequentially, the framework, mostly in names of classes and interfaces which means I have to bring the agents up to speed. So, after I made all the updates necessary to be able to compile the agents with the new version of the framework, I came up with a problem. This is the code for the game loading the .dllp  precode  dynamically load assembly from file GeometryFriendsAgents.dll  Assembly agentsDLL  Assembly.LoadFilepath    get type of classes BallAgent and SquareAgent from just loaded Assembly  Type circleType  AgentsDLL.GetTypeGeometryFriendsAgents.CircleAgent  Type rectangleType  AgentsDLL.GetTypeGeometryFriendsAgents.RectangleAgent  try         create instances of classes BallAgent and SquareAgent      npcCircle  ICircleAgentActivator.CreateInstancecircleType      npcRectangle  IRectangleAgentActivator.CreateInstancerectangleType  catchTargetInvocationException e      throw e.InnerException   codepre  pI can confirm that the path is correct. The lines inside the trycatch will throw a TargetInvocationException when I try to run the game Which will automatically load the agents. I added the trycatch to see the inner exception, which is a FormatException, and VisualStudio gives the aditional information that the input string was not in the correct format.p  pI dont know what part of the agents code would be relevant for this, but I have yet to get to the weird part. In the implementation Im using, the agents make use of a LearningCenter class. This class essentially reads and writes the learning files of the agents. at the start of the class it stores the path for the learning filesp  precodeprotected const string path  ........Agents codepre  pSo heres where things get weird. This is the correct path for the learning files. When earlier I made a mistake, I had this path which before was repeated many times throughout the code asp  precodeprotected const string path  ........Agents codepre  pWhen I build the .dll with the incorrect path, I can sucessfully load the agents and it will run the game. The problem then is that the path is incorrect, and when the LearningCenter tries to write the learning file, it will evidently fail with a DirectoryNotFoundException. The method in question isp  precodepublic void EndGamefloat knownStatesRatio      if toSave          FileStream fileStream  new FileStreampath  learningFolder  Ratios.csv, FileMode.Append         StreamWriter sw  new StreamWriterfileStream         sw.WriteLineknownStatesRatio         sw.Close         fileStream.Close         fileStream  new FileStreampath  learningFolder  IntraPlatformLearning.csv, FileMode.Create         DumpLearningfileStream, intraplatformPlayedStates         fileStream.Close         if interPlatform              fileStream  new FileStreampath  learningFolder  InterPlatformLearning.csv, FileMode.Create             DumpLearningfileStream, interplatformPlayedStates             fileStream.Close                            codepre  pThe exception occurs immediatly when creating the new filestream. Ive tried shifting the missing codecode to the codelearningFoldercode variable, but when I do it goes back to the first problem. So long as the path is incorrect, I can run the game...p  pI should also mention that before this I initially encountered another TargetInvocationException at the same location. At the time the problem was fixed by changing the visibility of the agent classes to public.p  pI realize that the thing with the path is probably hiding the actual problem, but I just dont know where to look next.p  pedit Heres the stack trace for the first problemp  precodeGeometryFriends.exeGeometryFriends.AI.AgentsManager.LoadAgents Line 396 GeometryFriends.exeGeometryFriends.Levels.SinglePlayerLevel.LoadLevelContent Line 78 GeometryFriends.exeGeometryFriends.Levels.Level.LoadContent Line 262 GeometryFriends.exeGeometryFriends.ScreenSystem.ScreenManager.LoadContent Line 253 Microsoft.Xna.Framework.Game.dllMicrosoft.Xna.Framework.DrawableGameComponent.Initialize  GeometryFriends.exeGeometryFriends.ScreenSystem.ScreenManager.Initialize Line 221  Microsoft.Xna.Framework.Game.dllMicrosoft.Xna.Framework.Game.Initialize  GeometryFriends.exeGeometryFriends.Engine.Initialize Line 203 Microsoft.Xna.Framework.Game.dllMicrosoft.Xna.Framework.Game.RunGamebool useBlockingRun Microsoft.Xna.Framework.Game.dllMicrosoft.Xna.Framework.Game.Run GeometryFriends.exeGeometryFriends.Program.Mainstring[] args Line 16 codepre  pThe agent thats failing first is the CircleAgent, heres the constructorp  precodepublic CircleAgent      Change flag if agent is not to be used     SetImplementedAgenttrue      lastMoveTime  DateTime.Now     lastRefreshTime  DateTime.Now     currentAction  0     rnd  new RandomDateTime.Now.Millisecond      model  new CircleWorldModelthis      learningCenter  new CircleLearningCentermodel     learningCenter.InitializeLearning      startTime  DateTime.Now  codepre  pedit 2 Ok, I managed to zone in on the source of the FormatException.

Negative 1828 pI recently uncovered a query which has since been lost that seemed to have an issue stemming from the use of a subquery alongside an IN clause. For examplep  precodeSELECT  FROM Table1 WHERE Column1 IN SELECT Column1 FROM Table2 codepre  pThe issue I seemed to notice was that when I used IN and NOT IN, the figures with each did not account for the total records in Table1. Whilst Table1 did not have any NULL values in Column1, I believe that Table2 did. Could this have caused an issue I appreciate that comparing something to NULL via the standard logical operators will not work in TSQL, but I have not been able to find anything regarding IN clauses with subqueries.p  pI unfortunately do not have the original query, and when I tried to reproduce the issue using some very general code, I could not. So I appreciate this is perhaps a vague question, but it would be useful to know of any dangers that people may not be generally aware of when using the INNOT IN operators with a subquery, specifically relating to NULLS. Any other general dangers not necessarily relating to NULLS would also be useful. p  pI would assume the general advice would be to use a JOIN, however this is primarily so that I can identify possible issues in existing code and remediate if necessary.p

Negative 1828 pI had a question on how matplotlib worked. Basically, I want to flip x and y in my image just as a hrefhttpsstackoverflow.comquestions18237169flipxandyaxesformatplotlibimshow1823734218237342newregfa5d957200d44afc8b07b226d7702ff8this person askeda.p  pHowever, I do not want to resort to transposing the array before sending it. p  pI assume this would result in a loss of performance. Now here is my reasoning. My guess is that matplotlib probably tries to copy an image from numpy to matplotlib by iterating over the rapidly varying index in both where rapidly varying index here is assumed the index that leads to accessing contiguous elements in physical memory. If I transpose the array, one of two cases can probably happenp  ol liWhat matplotlib thinks to be the rapidly varying index in memory is no longer true and thus it will no longer be accessing the numpy array in a memory contiguous fashion, resulting in slower readout. i.e. numpy just changes its view into the matrixli liThe Numpy array is actually copied into a new array where the rapidly varying index is transposed. The reading into matplotlib is fast at the cost of copying a new matrix into memory.li ol  pBoth of these cases are not ideal in my case as I would like to achieve reasonably high refresh rates. The arrays are loaded from images already stored on a hard drive stored in this fashion.p  pIf my assumption is true, is there some method to have matplotlib change its rapidly varying index for the case of an image This would be a very useful feature I believe.p  pI hope to have communicated my line of reasoning. I want to make sure every read and write in the chain is memory contiguous, from the hard drive to the numpy array to matplotlib. I believe that simply finding or offering in the future an option for matplotlib to reverse its method of ordering would save time.p  pI am definitely open to other solutions. If theres something obvious I have missed, Id like to hear it thanks p  hr  pstrongEditstrong Thanks for the comments. I believe you are right in that I should have done some testing before hand. I have an interesting result. The transpose seems to be faster than the nontranspose. Since the numpy reference is simply a view into the array, it is possible matplotlib uses this to its advantage to cleverly decide whether or not to transpose last minute This results suggests so, that or my code has a flaw which is very possible. Seriously, if thats true, good friggin job matplotlib developers p  pHere are the figuresp  pFigure 1  Transposed image blue and non transposed image green.

I then tried just following the mouse movements and got further but the splitter code is not quite working and its pretty ugly code. p  pNB Im not using dockable widgets as this code will be used for the central widget of an app. Id prefer to use drag and drop to do this  anyone have any ideasp  precodefrom PyQt4.QtGui import QWidget, QDrag, QTabBar, QTabWidget, QPainter, QPalette, QBrush, QColor,

Negative 1828 pI am creating a custom Xamarin Forms control that contains three buttons 1,2,3 inside a view. Lets just call it a codeGaugeViewcode for the sake of this example. Here is how it is currently setupp  ul liThe codeGuageViewcode has a custom renderer on both iOS and Android called codeGuageViewRenderercode.li liThe codeGuageViewcode exposes event handlers for codeClicked1code, codeClicked2code, and codeClicked3code.li liThe codeGuageViewcode exposes codeICommandcode properties for codeClick1code, codeClick2code, and codeClick3code.li ul  pThe problem is, I need to fire the event handlers from the custom renderer because only the native platform control knows when one of the buttons has been pressed. How do you bubble the events back up to the codeGuageViewcode, which is where the shared code livesp  pI was planning to wire up the commands and the event handlers down inside the custom renderer, but Im having a heck of a time with it since events can only be fired from within the original class codeGuageViewcode.p  pIs there a better way to structure this The main thing I am trying to do is expose the platform native guage and wire its buttons up so the event handlers in the shared code codeGuageViewcode gets the event firings.p

Negative 1828 pIve discovered a nice way to generate join tables for my HABTM relationships in my Rails app.p  precoderails g migration CreateJoinTable table1 table2 codepre  pThis generates an codeActiveRecordMigrationcode that employs the method codecreatejointablecodep  pIm wondering what this wonderful mysterious method does. I guess it makes a table probably without an codeidcode field that has a column for table1 foreign key and a column for table2 foreign key, but does the table have any other features. My habit for join tables has always been to add a unique index across both those columns so that a relationship between a record in table1 and a record in table2 cannot be entered twice.p  pMy question boils down to If I use codecreatejointablecode do I need to keep adding that unique index, or does this method do that for me I think it shouldp  pThe a hrefhttpedgeguides.rubyonrails.orgactiverecordmigrations.html relnofollowdocumentation I usually look ata doesnt go into this sort of detail.p

Negative 1828 pI have been tasked to enhance a SQL view for performance improvement that has psuedo code as follows. It has rownumber over partition by... order by..., which seems to be causing this view to run indefinitely until i kill the query. I.e. When I run codeselect  from viewname where Date  20150131code, it runs forever. But it runs fine if I run the whole view as a query e.g. remove alter view statement on top and pass the where clause at the end of the code. p  pI am using SQL 2005. It maybe that SQL 2005 engine generates execution plans differently for views vs normal queries because as I mentioned the entire code in the view, when executed as a query, runs fine. How can I make the view itself run faster so it can return the results One of the tables that my view queries table1 in this psuedo code is very large and is partitioned by date where each months data is one partition.p  pPSEUDOCODEp  precodeCREATE VIEW Sample AS WITH Dataset1 AS      SELECT table1.DATE         ,column1         ,column2         ,column3         ,column4     FROM table1     INNER JOIN table2 ON table1.DATE  table2.DATE          ,Dataset2 AS      SELECT Dataset1.DATE         ,column1         ,column2         ,column3         ,column4     FROM table3     INNER JOIN Dataset1 ON table3.column1  Dataset1.column1      SELECT ROWNUMBER OVER          PARTITION BY column1 ORDER BY column1 ASC          AS RowNumber     , FROM Dataset2 GO codepre
