Positive 60483 pIm trying to create a quick checklist of people attending an event. This checklist is a simple webpage to be used on an iPad, using localStorage to remember who has arrived and who has not.p  pWhat I would like to do is have a container or cell in my example below that changes its background color from the center outwards as it is held. Once the full cell is the new color, it remains that color once the user stops holding their finger on it. In this way you check people in to the event and the short hold should prevent accidental clicks.p  pMy problem arises when I want to create the same effect in reverse if I wish to remove someone from the event accidental click, person leaves etc, again filling from the center but this time using the original color. I find that the css and jquery that I am using causes the cell to immediately jump to the end of the fill animation for some reason.p  pIm also not great with this type of transition, probably going about it in a very cack handed way.p  pHere is my code so far, you should be able to copy and paste this into an .html doc and it will run accepting mouse presses in place of finger holdsp  precodeltdoctype htmlgt lthtml langengt ltheadgt   ltmeta charsetutf8gt   ltmeta nameviewport contentwidthdevicewidth, initialscale1gt   lttitlegtarrived demolttitlegt   ltlink relstylesheet hrefcode.jquery.commobile1.4.5jquery.mobile1.4.5.min.cssgt   ltscript srccode.jquery.comjquery1.10.2.min.jsgtltscriptgt   ltscript srccode.jquery.commobile1.4.5jquery.mobile1.4.5.min.jsgtltscriptgt   ltstylegt   html, body  padding 0 margin 0 webkituserselect none   html, .uimobile, .uimobile body      height 85px      .uimobile, .uimobile .uipage      minheight 85px      nav      fontsize 200     width17.1875em     margin17px auto 0 auto      nav a      color 777     border 2px solid 777     backgroundcolor ccc     padding 0.2em 0.6em     textdecoration none     float left     marginright 0.3em      nav ahover      color 999     bordercolor 999     background eee      nav a.selected,   nav a.selectedhover      color 0a0     bordercolor 0a0     background afa      .box      width 200px     height 100     backgroundcolor e1e1e1      .box.arrived      backgroundcolor green       Shutter Out Horizontal  .hvrshutterouthorizontal, .hvrshutterouthorizontal2    display inlineblock   verticalalign middle   webkittransform translateZ0   transform translateZ0   boxshadow 0 0 1px rgba0, 0, 0, 0   webkitbackfacevisibility hidden   backfacevisibility hidden   mozosxfontsmoothing grayscale   position relative   background e1e1e1   webkittransitionproperty color   transitionproperty color   webkittransitionduration 1s   transitionduration 1s  .hvrshutterouthorizontalbefore, .hvrshutterouthorizontal2before    content    position absolute   zindex 1   top 0   bottom 0   left 0   right 0   background green   webkittransform scaleX0   transform scaleX0   webkittransformorigin 50   transformorigin 50   webkittransitionproperty transform   transitionproperty transform   webkittransitionduration 1s   transitionduration 1s   webkittransitiontimingfunction easeout   transitiontimingfunction easeout  .hvrshutterouthorizontal2background green .hvrshutterouthorizontal2beforebackground e1e1e1  .hvrshutterouthorizontalhover, .hvrshutterouthorizontalfocus, .hvrshutterouthorizontalactive,  .hvrshutterouthorizontal2hover, .hvrshutterouthorizontal2focus, .hvrshutterouthorizontal2active    color white  .hvrshutterouthorizontal.tapbefore, .hvrshutterouthorizontal2.tapbefore    webkittransform scaleX1   transform scaleX1   td      padding 20px     verticalalign middle   tr tdfirstchild      width 500px       ltstylegt ltheadgt ltbodygt  lttablegt     lttrgt         lttdgtPersons namelttdgt         lttd idt1 classbox hvrshutterouthorizontalgtlttdgt     lttrgt     lttrgt         lttdgtSomeone elses namelttdgt         lttd classbox hvrshutterouthorizontalgtlttdgt     lttrgt  ltscriptgt      document .readyfunction          fori1ilt100i             iflocalStorage.getItemti  Y                 ti.addClassarrived                                 var tapTime  0     .box.bindvmousedown vmouseup, function event          if event.type  vmousedown              tapTime  new Date.getTime             ifthis.hasClassarrived                 if already marked as arrived                 this.addClasshvrshutterouthorizontal2                 this.addClasstap              else                  if not arrived                 this.addClasstap                          this.addClasstap          else              event.type  vmouseup             here you can check how long the tap was to determine what do do              var duration  new Date.getTime  tapTime             if duration gt 1000                  this is a taphold                 ifthis.hasClassarrived                     if already marked as arrived                   else                      this.removeClasstap                     this.removeClasshvrshutterouthorizontal                     this.addClassarrived                                     localStorage.setItemt1,Y              else                  this is a tap                 this.removeClasstap                            ltscriptgt  ltbodygt lthtmlgt codepre  pEDIT .gif of how it behaves, the circles around the mouse represent my mouse being clicked and held down a hrefhttpgfycat.comSecondhandSlipperyAngora relnofollowhttpgfycat.comSecondhandSlipperyAngoraap  pYou can see that the initial animation, filling the background with green from the center until the whole cell is green works just fine.p  pHowever when I click again to fill from the center as grey, the whole cell immediately turns grey.

I made this work with this codep  precode  ltdiv idheader dataroleheader datataptogglefalse datathemeb datapositionfixed dataidmainheadergt    ltdivgt    ltdiv idfooter datarolefooter datataptogglefalse datathemeb dataidmainfooter datapositionfixedgt    ltdivgt codepre  pWith NativeDroid2 this seems to be not working correctly anymore. When I try this code with the new NativeDroid upon changing the page header and footer are shown without CSS at least it seems like that for a short time.p  pAnyone has a idea how I could make it work againp
Positive 60483 pI have made a table as a php variable, which includes a bunch of jquery mobile code. I echo this php table variable from another php document which produces the data for the table. The variable is in an included file.p  pThe table contains the following string CO, pounds.p  pThe subscript 2 is unicode U2082.p  pHowever, when that variable is echoed into my browser Chrome,  CO, shows like thisp  pa hrefhttpi.stack.imgur.comYl63z.png relnofollowimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comYl63z.png altenter image description hereap  pi.e., that weird a followed by two commas the third comma is, I think, the actual comma.p  pThe  tag in the jqm document which is included as part of the echoed php variable is the followingp  precodeltmeta charsetutf8gt     ltmeta nameviewport contentwidthdevicewidth, initialscale1gt codepre  pI researched the problem, and all suggestions are to make sure the charset is UTF8, but that is what I already have in the meta tag in the variable which is echoed.p  pIf I display another identical jqm document directly in my browser, i.e. NOT by turning that documents script into a php variable, then CO displays properly.p  pAnybody have any idea why my browser is behaving this wayp

Positive 60483 pI tried to combine jquery mobile touchstart and touchend with audio record from Cordova. p  pWhen a button calls the touchstart event, then it will trigger mediaRect.startRecord, and when the finger lifts off the screen, it will calls the touchend event which triggers the mediaRect.stopRecord to stop the audio recording. p  pOn Android 4.4 and below. Whenever the touchstart event triggers the recording, the touchend event wont fire, if i remove the mediaRect.startRecord then the touchend fires just fine. p  pIf i use 2 separate buttons for start and stop, the mediaRect.startRecord and stopRecord also fires fine. p  pBut when i combine them, i have to trigger the touchstart twice before the touchend will fire.

But when I set the id of a listitem to the value of the input element codeidcode, the codeidcode or something else that I add there have always the same codeidcode or codetimecode like the last added postlist item. p  pThe second input element which should insert the codeautorcode of the post works fine. p  precode    ltdiv datarolecontentgt                 ltphp includelist.php gt     ltdiv datademohtmltruegt                 ltul datarolelistview datainsettrue classuilistview uilistviewinset uicornerall uishadowgt                  ltphp foreach result as key gt row gt                      ltli id listone namelistone  datarolelistdivider roleheading classuili uilidivider uibarb uilihascount uifirstchildgtltphp echo row[date] gtltligt                     ltli datacornersfalse datashadowfalse dataiconshadowtrue datawrapperelsdiv dataiconarrowr dataiconposright datathemea gt                     ltdiv classuibtninner uiligtltdiv classuibtntextgtlta classuilinkinheritgtltagtltp classuiliaside uilidescgtltstronggtltstronggtltphp echo row[time] gtltpgt                         ltp classuilidescgtltstronggtltphp echo row[title] gtltstronggtltpgt                         ltp classuilidescgtltphp echo row[text] gtltpgt                          ltp classuilidescgtltstronggtltphp echo row[town] gtltstronggtltpgt               lta hrefpopupcomment datarelpopup datapositiontowindow datatransitionpopgtcommentltagt                ltdiv datarolepopup idpopupcomment datathemea classuicornerallgt     ltform dataajaxfalse nameloginform classloginform action.comments.php methodpost stylepadding20px 40pxgt         ltdiv classcontentgt     ltphp includeshowcomments.php gt     ltphp foreach comments as keyComment gt rowComment gt     ltdivgt     ltp classuilidescgtltstronggtltphp echo rowComment[username] gtltstronggtltpgt                         ltp classuilidescgtltphp echo rowComment[comment] gtltpgt                         ltdivgt                 ltphp endforeach gt      ltinput typehidden nameid idid valueltphp echo row[id] gt typetextgt       ltinput typehidden nameautorpost idautorpost valueltphp echo row[autor] gt typetext gt lt autor des posts gt lttextarea rows1 nametext idtext classfoogtlttextareagt         ltdivgt         ltdiv classfootergt         ltinput typesubmit namesubmit valuecomment classbutton datathemeagt                   ltdivgt       ltformgt ltdivgt                      ltligt          ltphp endforeach gt  ltulgt             ltdivgt       ltdivgt ltdivgt ltdivgt codepre  pcomments.php p  precode    hostnamelocalhost         userroot         password  ifissetPOST[submit]                                     try          dbh  new PDOmysqlhostlocalhostdbnamesearchfood, user, password          dbhgtsetAttributePDOATTRERRMODE, PDOERRMODEEXCEPTION  lt add this line          prepare your query         query  INSERT INTO comments username, autorpost, comment, idpost, time VALUES , , , , now          stmt  dbhgtpreparequery          bind variables         stmtgtexecutearrayCOOKIE[username], POST[autorpost], POST[text], POST[id]          pull last insert id         new  dbhgtlastInsertId            show success message or redirect, whatever you want         echo New Record Inserted Successfully         message[success]  Neuer Benutzer  . htmlspecialcharsPOST[username] .  wurde angelegt, lta hreflogin.phpgtweiter zur Anmeldungltagt.         headerLocation http.SERVER[HTTPHOST].lendsthmain.php, true, 302                       catchPDOException e                                          echo egtgetMessage                        codepre

Positive 60483 pIm using PhoneGap and JQueryMobile to create a mobile app that I want to deploy to both iOS and Android. The app is simple, and just consists of 3 bars A headersearch bar, a second bar displays the results of the search, and the remaining screen is a  that the user can write in.p  pBecause I want to code my layout to look the same for the greatest  of devices, Ive written my CSS for the layout of the app in s. Header is 6, Second bar is 14, ect. This appears to work decently for the devices Ive tested for so far. I ran into an issue where the Android keyboard would squish the viewport height and therefore my layout. So I set the keyboard to resizePan and that solved the squishing issue. However now the bottom of the  is not visible until the user closes the keyboard.p  pIn the questions Ive seen about that issue, the solution is to swap to adjustResize so that the user can scroll when the keyboard is active. I cant do this, because I want to avoid the layoutsquish issue.p  pIs there a way to fix this without having to rewrite the CSS If I HAVE to rewrite the CSS, how should I code the layout to look consistent on multiple devices Do I have to use an extensive list of media queries for all possible devicesp  pNote This isnt an issue for ios, because the softinput keyobard overlays the textarea like adjustPan but still allows the user to scroll down and up to parts of the document outside of the view or covered by the keyboard.p

In other words, if I pass it any sentence with the word new etc in it, it should be able to match it.p  pSo lets say I change my grammar top  pre rule line     string whitespace condition whitespace string end pre  pThen, it should be able to find a match forp  prep parser.parserandomstring new anotherstringpre  pSo, what do I have to do to allow the string whitespace to be repeated before and after condition If I try to write thisp  pre rule line     string whitespace condition whitespace string end pre  p, it goes in an infinite loop. If i replace the above  with [], it returns nil In general, regexs return a match when i use the above, but treetop regexs dont. Does anyone have any tipspoints on how to go about this Plus, since there isnt much documentation for treetop and the examples are either too trivial or too complex, is there anyone who knows a more thorough documentationguide for treetopp

Negative 60483 pHas anyone tried to apply a smoother to the evaluation metric before applying the Lmethod to determine the number of kmeans clusters in a dataset  If so, did it improve the results Or allow a lower number of kmeans trials and hence much greater increase in speed  Which smoothing algorithmmethod did you usep  pThe LMethod is detailed in  a hrefhttpcs.fit.edupkcpapersictai04salvador.pdf relnofollowstrongDetermining the Number of ClustersSegments in Hierarchical ClusteringSegmentation Algorithmsstrong, Salvador amp Chanap  pThis calculates the evaluation metric for a range of different trial cluster counts. Then, to find the knee which occurs for an optimum number of clusters, two lines are fitted using linear regression. A simple iterative process is applied to improve the knee fit  this uses the existing evaluation metric calculations and does not require any reruns of the kmeans.p  pFor the evaluation metric, I am using a reciprocal of a simplified version of the Dunns Index. Simplified for speed basically my diameter and intercluster calculations are simplified. The reciprocal is so that the index works in the correct direction ie. lower is generally better.p  pKmeans is a stochastic algorithm, so typically it is run multiple times and the best fit chosen. This works pretty well, but when you are doing this for 1..N clusters the time quickly adds up. So it is in my interest to keep the number of runs in check. Overall processing time may determine whether my implementation is practical or not  I may ditch this functionality if I cannot speed it up.p

Negative 60483 pI am making a program in which two players face each other in combat, each player have a skill level, represented by a number between 1 and 100, this number is used to determine which player is better so for example if player A has 50 and player B has 100 then B has 50 more chances of winning the combat, What would be a good way of getting this number knowing the skill level of both playersp  pI tried different ways, for example adding both skill levels and throwing a selecting a random number in this range if the number is less than a player skill then he wins however i am not sure if this is a good way, I think the probability is off. I also tried to use rules, for example if they have the same skill then is 50 anyone can win if one is half the other then is 25 chances for the lower player and so on but this gets complicated fast.

Negative 60483 pim hoping somebody can help me out here.

And it looks fine and works as youd expect it to on any modern browser on my Win7 PC.p  pOn iPhone 4 Safari I dont have an iPad to check that out the button appears in the correct width and height as far as I can see by using a background colour.  There is an inexplicable gap to the left and part of the image is being lost because of the overflow.p  pIve been unable to find any CSS that appears to be causing this, or that can fix it  so this is an annoyance.  Has anyone encountered similar  Because im working in limited space hence the fixed size and overflow just leaving it is not really my preferred option as it kills the look of the box.p  pMy present workaround is to scrap the button tag and submit the form via an onclick on the image, though I wouldnt really consider this to be ideal.p  pSo to summarise  the BUTTON appears to be correctly sized and located, but its child IMG is rendering in the wrong place on iPhone 4.p  pEDIT Sorry, should have included a link... a hrefhttpwww.wamdirect.co.uk relnofollowwamdirect.co.uka is the site im working on, the problem is in the login box top right when viewed on iPhone 4.p

Negative 60483 pSo I am currently working on a migration from an old Advantage database server to SQL 2005 using SSIS 2008. One of the columns in the old Advantage database is a MEMO type. By default this translates to a DTTEXT column. Well in the new database I do not need this large of field, but can limit it to something such as VARCHAR50. I successfully set up a derived column transformation to convert this with the following expressionp  precodeDTSTR,50,1252[ColumnName] codepre  pNow I want to go a step further and replace all NULL values with an empty string. This would seem easy enough using an codeISNULL[ColumnName]DTSTR,50,1252[ColumnName]code expression, but the problem is that the OLE DB Destination contains the following error p  blockquote   pCannot convert between unicode and nonunicode strings...p blockquote  pSo apparently the whole ISNULL expression converts the data type to Unicode string [DTWSTR]. I have tried a variety of casts upon the whole expression or different parts, but I cannot get the data type to match what I need it.p  pFirst, is it possible to convert the DTTEXT type directly to unicode From what I can tell, the casts dont work that way. If not, is there a way to get an expression to work so that NULL values get converted to empty stringsp  pThank you for all your helpp

Negative 60483 pWhat is the best way, using PHP, to design a modular system that can be added to as easily as possible For example, if you had a shopping cart, you might have a payment base class that has all your required methods. Then you can have a Paypal class that extends that class, and a VisaMastercard that also extends the base class, but how do you actually put them in usep  pIf you did a functional version of the cart, you could make a function called codedoExecutecode and pass in the required information. Then you name all the files as codePaymentMethod.phpcode. The file names are then read, creating a list of acceptable payment methods. Once one is picked, that file is the only one included in the script, and then the codedoExecutecode method is called guaranteeing that the method in the payment method include file is the one called.p  pHowever, for an object oriented approach, that really does work that well. How do you add in the additional methods without having to keep modifying the code to include objects of the new classesp

Negative 60483 pI have an Array to be displayed in a CakePHP View which contains the navigation data. Each array item contains fields like id, name, level etc. as well as another array field named children, where this structure repeats.p  pIn the Cake PHP View its easy to walk over the array on the first level with a foreach loop and the htmlHelper to output the relevant data.

Negative 60483 pIve been looking at the Game Center code example, a hrefhttpdeveloper.apple.comlibraryiossamplecodeGKTapperIntroductionIntro.htmlapplerefdocuidDTS40010283 relnofollowGKTappera, and one section where the developer comments on his implementation does not make too much sense to me.  The code is inserted below.  What I do not understand is why would dispatching a block that modifies a viewcontroller on the main thread not be safe  p  pHe mentions that If the viewcontroller is referenced in a block that executes on a secondary queue, then it may be released outside the main queue. This is true even if the actual block is scheduled on the main thread. How is that possible if the code dealing with the release is on the main UI thread on the main runloop  Or is there something with BlocksGCD that I am not gettingp  pWhats even more curious to me is how his solution even solves this problem.  Because callDelegate is the only method to access the delegate, I can ensure that delegate is not visible in any of my block callbacks. Delegate is a viewcontroller herep  pCould someone enlighten me about this entire thing  Im quite new to blocks and GCD so perhaps I am missing something simple...p  precode NOTE  GameCenter does not guarantee that callback blocks will be execute on the main thread.  As such, your application needs to be very careful in how it handles references to view  controllers.  If a view controller is referenced in a block that executes on a secondary queue,  that view controller may be released and deallocd outside the main queue.  This is true  even if the actual block is scheduled on the main thread.  In concrete terms, this code  snippet is not safe, even though viewController is dispatching to the main queue    [object doSomethingWithCallback            dispatchasyncdispatchgetmainqueue, void                  [viewController doSomething]          ]   UIKit view controllers should only be accessed on the main thread, so the snippet above may  lead to subtle and hard to trace bugs.  Many solutions to this problem exist.  In this sample,  Im bottlenecking everything through  callDelegateOnMainThread which calls callDelegate.  Because callDelegate is the only method to access the delegate, I can ensure that delegate  is not visible in any of my block callbacks.   Delegate in this case is a view controller.   void callDelegate SEL selector withArg id arg error NSError err      assert[NSThread isMainThread]     if[delegate respondsToSelector selector]              ifarg  NULL                      [delegate performSelector selector withObject arg withObject err]                  else                      [delegate performSelector selector withObject err]                   else              NSLogMissed Method         void callDelegateOnMainThread SEL selector withArg id arg error NSError err      dispatchasyncdispatchgetmainqueue, void             [self callDelegate selector withArg arg error err]         void authenticateLocalUser      if[GKLocalPlayer localPlayer].authenticated  NO              [[GKLocalPlayer localPlayer] authenticateWithCompletionHandlerNSError error                      [self callDelegateOnMainThread selectorprocessGameCenterAuth withArg NULL error error]         ]       codepre

I basically want to ensure that the web service calls are coming from a game client.p

I do some codeaggregatecode calls example code at bottom that blow up the memory. I also use date utility fns something like what is attached at bottom here they will need recoding for compactness, but these are the typical operations I want to do a lot of. So I need a representation for the date that avoids this.p  pAs I see it there are three possible representations I could use for visitdate field, here are the pros and cons, wrt what I am trying to do. My aim is to get the format which does not blow up memory, and gives the least grief during these date handling operations, aggregate etc.p  ul listrongintegerstrong or strongfactorstrong Cons 1 doesnt allow comparison or sort operations, hence aggregation is painful. 2 I would need to hardcode all the daterelated functions e.g. 14700..14729 for Apr 2010  doable but painful. 3 Needs manual handling for graphs.li listrongnumericstrong Cons blows up memory due to requiring asDate everywhere.li listrongDatestrong Pros most readable for print, graphs and histograms does not need manual handling treatment before graphing.

Negative 60483 pIm having an issue in my OpenGL application where OpenGL appears to add a vertex at the origin of some of my meshes. The issue has me befuddled because it seems to only affect meshes composed of triangle strips. The basic procedure used to create the screenshot at the end of the post is as follows  p  ol liUse a hrefhttppaulbourke.netmiscellaneousspherecylinder relnofollowsimple matha to generate vertices that lie on the unit sphere, as well as texture coordinates and element indices. li liLoad the data from step 1 into buffers bound to a VAO.li liEvery frame bind the VAO and draw with codeglDrawElementscodeli ol  pPrior to posting, I checked the vertex data for a simplified version of my mesh at each stage in the process, and at no time is there a vertex at the origin in modelspace.

Negative 60483 pIm reading about CoffeeScript and am still trying to position the language, what can be done, what are the best practices, etc Im more used to strongly typed languages AS3, Java, Scala so my two questions may make you smile a bit p  pQuestion 1 Custom collectionsp  pWhat do you think about custom collections  JSCS is one of the weakest languages in this aspect For instance there is no Array.remove and you have to use the cumbersome splice method instead. Some function libraries Like underscore augment the API by providing functions taking arraysobjects as the first arg but given the choice I would prefer to writep  precodelist fancyFunction 3, 4 codepre  prather thanp  precodefancyFunction list 3, 4 codepre  pLets say I create a List class Is it possible and if yes, what are the requisites for this class to be able to use CSs comprehension syntax  Worst case scenario, I guess the List could have a toArray method and the usual CS operations could be performed on that returned value instead, but I hope there is a better solution.p  pIdeally, I would like to be able to define rich, custom collections, but not at the cost of losing comprehensions, etc.p  pQuestion 2 Mutabilityp  pWhat are people feelings about being very careful with mutability in CSJS in general p  pWhen I read various code online, I have the impression everything is mutable and people generally think its better not to bother and have less lines of code instead.p  pFor instance, mutable versus immutable basic Point class Hopefully Im not doing something wrongp  pMutablep  precodeclass Point   constructor x, y gt codepre  pImmutablep  precodeclass Point   constructor x, y gt     x  gt x     y  gt y codepre  pNot that much more complicated but slightly weirder syntax. Another consideration is that JS is not the fastest thing known to man and having to create lots of objects in a loop just for the sake of being a purist might be counter productive, performance wise. I didnt benchmark the cost of creating new Point objects versus altering the members of one though.p  pImagine a big app with lots of modules communicating through thin APIs. Wouldnt you want to pass immutable objects around  Or do you perform defensive copies instead p  pNote I am not trying to try and bend CS to the languages I know Rather I want to know if it makes sense to reuse some of the concepts taken for granted in other languages. p  pThanksp

In this case the href parameter for my resolver class is set to ......xslhtml.xsl, which is fine. The html.xsl file then imports a file called defaults.xsl.

However, if the docbook.xsl imports a file called defaults.xsl, the href parameter is also set to defaults.xsl and base is set to null.p  pThe issue is that the href and base parameters dont uniquely identify the resource, and you cant guess which file is being requested by watching the order of the previous hrefs either.

Negative 60483 pIm trying to port a LabView program to C, and the OLE calls it contains are giving me some trouble.p  pThe LabView program starts out by doing an Automation open, i.e. getting a reference to the interface JYDEVICECONFIGLib.IJYDevConfigInterface LabView calls this expression the ActiveX class, then calls the method QA found in the interface and finally closes the reference again.

Negative 60483 pWhat is the embest practiceem for defining the target strongoutput folder for DebugReleasestrong Is it better to have strongseparate foldersstrong for DebugRelease or should I use the strongsame folderstrong for both when using .NETCp  pI have two separate solutions, so the projects of one solution cant have a reference by project to a project of the other solution. So you are forced to add a reference to the assembly file directly. This results in another problem If you add a reference to another assembly via a file you can add only one instead of one for debug and one fore release like you can do with libraries in C. Another problem is that I have to add a reference, for example, to binstrongReleasestrongMyOtherProjectMyAssembly.dll.

Negative 60483 pI created a MainActivity in which the user has a few app options, displayed in a grid menu, which access subsequent specific activities.

Negative 60483 pIve written a program in MATLAB and Im considering three methods of deploying the program to end users. The first method involves converting the .m files to pcode and then deploying that to end users who can use the pcode in MATLAB but cannot see the code themselves. The second method involves compiling the .m files to C using MATLAB Compiler and MATLAB Builder NE and then using Visual Studio to obfuscate the code and to also create the end product. The third method involves using MATLAB Compiler and MATLAB Builder EX to create an Excel addin, and deploying the Excel addin to endusers.p  pI am wondering how hard it is for someone to reverse engineer or crack and gain access to the code in each of these three methods of deployment that I am considering. I know that it is essentially impossible to create a program that cant be cracked or reverse engineered, but is any method of deployment harder to crack than other methods I know that pcode gives the end user access to the names of the files which I guess can potentially help someone reverse engineer your program.p  pThanks in advance for your assistancep

Negative 60483 pIve been working on a project that uses Flex  Blazeds  Spring. Now some parts of it must run offline due to connectivity issues. The problem is how to deal with the existing architecture, preserving it as much as possible, or at least how to create a solution not too much hard to evolve.  Ive seen many similar questions searching on the internet, but the most common approach is writing all code in actionscriptincluding business logic, access to database, transactions and so on, what I particularly dont consider suitable for the case. Im thinking of using Jetty embedded in the application and some kind of embeddable database such as Java DB, so I could access my Spring services normally without any big change. Some workmates, however, disagree. They think that a web server running on a clients machine can lead to performance issues and a more lightweight solution is the way to go. Until now, no other solution came up.  What do you suggestp

Negative 60483 pThis is more a solution  work around than an actual question. Im posting it here since I couldnt find this solution on stack overflow or indeed after a lot of Googling.p  pstrongThe Problemstrongp  pI have an MVC 3 webapp using EF 4 code first that I want to write unit tests for. Im also using NCrunch to run the unit tests on the fly as I code, so Id like to avoid backing onto an actual database here.p  pstrongOther Solutionsstrongp  pemIDataContextemp  pIve found this the most accepted way to create an in memory datacontext. It effectively involves writing an interface IMyDataContext for your MyDataContext and then using the interface in all your controllers. An example of doing this is a hrefhttprefactorthis.wordpress.com20110531mockfakingdbcontextinentityframework41withagenericrepositoryherea. p  pThis is the route I went with initially and I even went as far as writing a T4 template to extract IMyDataContext from MyDataContext since I dont like having to maintain duplicate dependent code.p  pHowever I quickly discovered that some Linq statements fail in production when using IMyDataContext instead of MyDataContext. Specifically queries like this throw a NotSupportedExceptionp  precodevar siteList  from iSite in MyDataContext.Sites                let iMaxPageImpression  from iPage in MyDataContext.Pages where iSite.SiteId  iPage.SiteId select iPage.AvgMonthlyImpressions.Max                select new  Site  iSite, MaxImpressions  iMaxPageImpression  codepre  pstrongMy Solutionstrongp  pThis was actually quite simple. I simply created a MyInMemoryDataContext subclass to MyDataContext and overrode all the IDbSetlt.. properties as belowp  precodepublic class InMemoryDataContext  MyDataContext, IObjectContextAdapter       ltsummarygtWhether SaveChanges was called on the DataContextltsummarygt     public bool SaveChangesWasCalled  get private set       public InMemoryDataContext              InitializeDataContextProperties         SaveChangesWasCalled  false            ltsummarygt      Initialize all MyDataContext properties with appropriate container types      ltsummarygt     private void InitializeDataContextProperties              Type myType  GetType.BaseType  We have to do this since private Property.Set methods are not accessible through GetType            Initialize all IDbSetltTgt properties with CollectionDbSetltTgt instances         var DbSets  myType.GetProperties.Wherex gt x.PropertyType.IsGenericType ampamp x.PropertyType.GetGenericTypeDefinition  typeofIDbSetltgt.ToList         foreach var iDbSetProperty in DbSets                      var concreteCollectionType  typeofCollectionDbSetltgt.MakeGenericTypeiDbSetProperty.PropertyType.GetGenericArguments             var collectionInstance  Activator.CreateInstanceconcreteCollectionType             iDbSetProperty.SetValuethis, collectionInstance,null                    ObjectContext IObjectContextAdapter.ObjectContext               get  return null            public override int SaveChanges              SaveChangesWasCalled  true         return 1       codepre  pIn this case my CollectionDbSetlt is a slightly modified version of FakeDbSetlt a hrefhttpromiller.com20120214testingwithafakedbcontextherea which simply implements IDbSet with an underlying ObservableCollection and ObservableCollection.AsQueryable.p  pThis solution works nicely with all my unit tests and specifically with NCrunch running these tests on the fly.p  pstrongFull Integration Testsstrongp  pThese Unit tests test all the business logic but one major downside is that none of your LINQ statements are guaranteed to work with your actual MyDataContext. This is because testing against an in memory data context means youre replacing the LinqToEntity provider but a LinqToObjects provider as pointed out very well in the answer to a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions6766478unittestingdbcontextthisa SO question.p  pTo fix this I use Ninject within my unit tests and setup InMemoryDataContext to bind instead of MyDataContext within my unit tests. You can then use Ninject to bind to an actual MyDataContext when running the integration tests via a setting in the app.config.p  precodeifGlobal.RunIntegrationTest     DependencyInjector.BindltMyDataContextgt.ToltMyDataContextgt.InSingletonScope else     DependencyInjector.BindltMyDataContextgt.ToltInMemoryDataContextgt.InSingletonScope codepre  pLet me know if you have any feedback on this however, there are always improvements to be made.p

I would like to share with you some questions.p  pNow, my goal is to find biomedical entities in biomedical text from Medline and through of dictionaries of terms, I can identify each entity found with its unique identifier.p  pTo store text, dicitionaries and results, I am using MongoDB a nonSQL database. Each abstract is splitted in sentences, and each sentence is store in a new record with list of tokens, chunks and PartofSpeech tags. To find entities, I get all senteces and for each one I create a regular expresion for each term in the dictionary in Pythonp  precodefor term in dicitonary      matches  re.finditerr  term  , sentence      for m in matches           ini  m.start           end  m.end           result.appendini, end, dictionary.getidentification[term] codepre  pBut it is really slow, I have several subsets of 150,000 abstracts 1,000,000 of sentences.p  pFor me, it is really interesting softmatching to extract more entities where their terminology is not exactly in my dictionary, but it can increase my running time.p  pI think that my problem is to do a lot of regular expressions I have dictionary with 300,000 entries for each sentence, because I have to find the terms in sentence. Without Machine Learning algorithm, how could you resolve this problem And with ML algorithms Now, I am flexible to change my programming language, databases...p  pThank you very muchp  pRegards,p  plex.p

Negative 60483 pI know that the computation in scikitlearn is based on NumPy so everything is a matrix or array.p  pHow does this package handle mixed data numerical and nominal valuesp  pFor example, a product could have the attribute color and price, where color is nominal and price is numerical. I notice there is a model called DictVectorizer to numerate the nominal data. For example, two products  arep  precodeproducts  [colorblack,price10, colorgreen,price5] codepre  pAnd the result from DictVectorizer could bep  precode[[1,0,10],  [0,1,5]] codepre  pIf there are lots of different values for the attribute color, the matrix would be very sparse. And long features will degrade the performance of some algorithms, such as decision trees. p  pstrongIs there any way to use the nominal value without the need to create dummy codesstrongp

My current UIControl element looks like this p  precodehandles.chkS11Enuicontrolf,unit,normalized,BackgroundColor,[0.8,0.8,0.8],Enable,on,FontAngle,normal,FontName,helvetica,FontSize,[12],FontUnits,points,FontWeight,normal,ForegroundColor,[0,0,0],HorizontalAlignment,center,ListboxTop,[],Max,[1],Min,[0],Position,[0.02140625,0.791119360625398,0.0803125,0.0369667],Relief,flat,SliderStep,[0.01,0.1],String,S11,Style,checkbox,Value,[0],VerticalAlignment,middle,Visible,on,Tag,chkS11En,Callback,chkS11Encallbackhandles codepre  pAnd my callback that runs when I check the checkbox is thisp  precodecS11En  findobjtag, chkS11En      checkbox option tS11MagUpperBound  findobjtag, txtS11MagUpperBound  edit box that is controlled  mprintfdn,cS11En.Value if cS11En.Value  [1] then     mprintfChecked  on n     settS11MagUpperBound,BackgroundColor,[1,1,1]     settS11MagUpperBound,Enable,on     setcS11Save,Enable,on elseif cS11En.Value  [0] then     mprintfChecked  off n     settS11MagUpperBound,BackgroundColor,[0.8,0.8,0.8]     settS11MagUpperBound,Enable,off     setcS11Save,Enable,off end codepre  pThe problem with this code seems to be that the second path Value  1 never seems to run, even when i continually toggle the checkbox. I get an output like sop  precode0 Checked  off  0 Checked  off  0 Checked  off  0 Checked  off  codepre  pIs there something Im doing wrong in order to reload checking the element I want to be able to run both paths, however I can never seem to get a value of 1 from the checkbox element. Does anyone have a solution to this Thanksp

Thus the number of rows in the tableView dont get adapted to the new results the number of returned objects is correct according to the error message.p  pThe second question is then why does the delegate fire when addingdeleting objects but not after the predicates and therefore the results have changedp  pThank you in advance.p

Negative 60483 pSince, Ive installed the latest 10.8.2 Operating system and upgraded Xcode to 4.5.2, Ive started to get problems with an application I wrote which has been working for a long time.p  pThe application has a class CalculateTimeFiles which has a method which runs itself on a background queue which builds a ivar NSMutableArray which is an array of strings.  This array and a status counter is observed by a second class RunResultWindow which takes the messages off of the NSMutableArray and displays them in a scrolling text view box within a window.  As the messages are generated by CalculateTimeFiles, RunResultWindow picks them up and drops them into the text view to give the user an idea of what CalculateTimeFiles is doing at the moment.p  pThis process has worked fine for a long time but I guess in this new version of Xcode, ARC is now enabled for dispatch queues which I think is a new thing.  The code runs fine in Xcode but blows up when I export the application outside of Xcode and run it there.  What I am finding is that something happens at the end of the background dispatch queue task which causes the whole thing to go belly up.  I assume that it is working in Xcode because Xcode itself has established some observability to the ivars in CalculateTimeFiles and keeping something from disappearing.  p  pIve made sure I think that the strings in the ivar NSMutableArray are not defined in the background task but instead in a separate method which I forced to the main queue.p  pAny help I can get on this would be great.p  pHere are some code snippets which are pertinentp  pThis is from the main app delegatep  precode IBActionrunButtonPressedidsender  ...... ......

Below is a simple description of their structurep  pThe catalogproductentityvarchar looks as followsp  precodevalueid     entitytypeid    attributeid    storeid       entityid     value      PK              INT              INT            INT              INT       VARCHAR codepre  pAnd the catalogproductentitymediagallery table looks as followsp  precodevalueid      attributeid        entityid        value     PK               INT                INT          VARCHAR codepre  pI need to insert the entity, and value columns from catalogproductentitymediagallery into catalogproductentityvarchar. However as you can see the structure is quite different.p  pThe query Im trying to use is as followsp  precodeUSE magentodb INSERT INTO catalogproductentityvarcharentitytypeid, attributeid, storeid, entityid, value  SELECT  4,  74,  0,  catalogproductentitymediagallery.entityid,  catalogproductentitymediagallery.value  FROM catalogproductentitymediagallery codepre  pI only need the entityid and value from mediagallery and the other values are always the same, I have tried to do this using the above but this is just hanging in MySQL no errorsp  pI think its due to the fact that Im trying to select 4, 74 and 0 from catalogproductentitymediagallery but Im not 100 sure apologies, Im a bit of a novice with MySQLp  pCan anybody point me in the right direction Is there any way way I can insert some data from the media table whilst inserting static values for some columns I hope this all makes sensep
Negative 60483 pIm currently developing a simple P2P network as an exercise. Each node in the network sends heartbeats to a subset of the other nodes to be able to detect nodes that have left the network. Beside the heartbeat packets I send packets when new nodes joinleave the network, when they want to locate a resource small text files, etc. All packets are UDP packets.p  pWhenever I receive a packet I start a new thread that handles that specific packet. I am however concerned with the amount of threads I start during one applications lifetime which adds up to quite a lot Especially because of the heartbeats.  There is also the risk of deadlocks and the like I would like to avoid. p  pI thought about having a queue or something where I put all incoming packets and have a single thread handling all packets one at a time from that queue something like the producerconsumer pattern. I would like the packets to be handled rapidly so the sender doesnt think the packet is lost.p  pWhat is the best way to handle a lot of different incoming packets without having to start a new thread for each of them Should I go with what I have, the producerconsuming or something differentp

Negative 60483 pI have a program I wrote in C that interacts with a propriety COM interface.  Unfortunately, this interface has features that do not work properly with C.  However, the interface works fine from Visual Basic.  p  pI have already written a lot of code in C on the parts of the interface that DO work from C, so I dont really want to rewrite it all in VB if I can avoid it.  I would like to find an easy way to use Visual Basic for the features I do need, without rewriting all the code I already have.  So, the question is, what is the BEST ay to do thisp  pMy first attemptp  pI was hoping I could just pass the COM object that I created in C to Visual Basic and it would work. Like sop  pCp  precodeType type  Type.GetTypeFromProgIDACM Application acm  System.Activator.CreateInstancetype ACMAccess.ACMAccess acmAccess new ACMAccess.ACMAccessacm codepre  pVBp  precodeSub NewByVal acm     Dim starVars  acm.Simulation.Flowsheet.FindMatchingVariables      For Each Var In starVars         Console.WriteLineVar.Name     Next End Sub codepre  pSadly, this does not work.  The failure is kind of interesting, in the debugger it has the right type, but if I call a method, it doesnt do anything.  If I try a method name that doesnt exist, I get an exception, but an existing method, nothing happens.  p  pSecond ideap  pThe alternative I can think of, which Ive been avoiding for a while, is the delegation pattern.  Create a VB object that actually creates and does all the interaction with the COM interface.  The rest of the C program would only use the COM interface through the VB wrapper.  As opposed to passing it back and forth as in the first attempt.p

Negative 60483 pIn my editor I have a strongLayersManagerstrong and a strongLayersViewstrong class. The LayersManager class holds all the layers that the user is currently using think Photoshop layers. The LayersView is a JPanel that lists the layers contained in the LayersManager.p  pWhat I would like to do is to update the LayersView JPanel by adding or removing a LayerComponent from the JPanels container whenever the addLayer or removeLayer methods are called from the LayersManager.p  pIn other words, what I want is a reverse ChangeListener where whenever a change is made in the LayersManager, the LayersView is automatically contacted, adds or removes a LayerComponent from its container and invalidates itself.p  pSo my questions are Is there a standard built in listener to do this Are listeners the right way to go Or should I just include a reference to the LayersView inside the LayersManager and manually call the required methods I suspect this is bad design I cant think of a nice design wise way of implementing my own listeners.p  pAny help appreciatedp
Negative 60483 pI have been searching but have gotten no luck with finding a supposed compiler flag or something of the sorts that would allow me to build my FORTRAN DLL using Intel Visual Fortran Composer XE 2013 compiler in order for it to load with a random base address each time. I am explicitly loading my FORTRAN DLL in my C code and it loadsunloads fine but I just noticed that the address in which it loads to each time is the EXACT same location. I wonder if that is why at times my FORTRAN DLL would load successfully and other times fail when I run my program multiple times simultaneously. Does there exist any random base address compiler options for the Intel Fortran compiler I have read in the release notes for it but no luck either.p

Negative 60483 pIm writing a blog in Google App Engine using Python and Jinja2. I have a GQL Table for my blogposts and one for all the comments. Each record in the common table has a blogpostid column so that I know which blogpost they are linked to. I use the query SELECT  from BLOGPOSTS and pass this to my render function. Then in my HTML Template there is a forloop that prints out all my blogposts. This goes pretty smooth. In the permalink of a blogpost, its easy to print the comments because I know the blogpostid so I can just query the comments table against it and print them out.p  pWhereas, On the front page I want to display the first two comments of every blogpost right below it. but I am not able to come up with a solution for printing out comments below the blogposts on my frontpage because I dont know how to pass the comments of a particular blogpost to my render function.

Negative 60483 pI feel like such a noob for asking this question, but its been bugging me for a while now.p  pWhen designing the BLL of a tiered application, would you put all your entity classes in one namespace For example If you have a database with Customers and their Vehicles and these Vehicles get Serviced on lets say a Monthly basis. I would think one would keep the Customers and their Vehicles in a separate module from the services module so that if you ever need to update the way services are done or where the data is stored, you do not need to touch the CustomerVehicle module.p  pAm I correct in thinking this way or should I change my design ideasp  pThis has presented me with a problem with using LINQ to SQL. If half of the tables entity classes is contained in module A and the other in module B then somewhere you are going to have module A reference module B and vice versa to accommodate the associations between 2 tables that border with the modules.p  pOR just thought about this now would you have 1 tables entity class overlap in the modules having the same class in both modulesp  pAny advice would be appreciated.p

Negative 60483 pI have a thread which calls functions of certain form to update this form. When task is done, thread updates form with results, using codeSynchronizecode and it all works fine while the program is running.p  pThe problem happens when the thread is running and I close the program I got access violation. It was caused by thread updating form which was already released. After rearranging order of form creation calls to codeApplicationgtCreateFormcode it worked fine because now the form that holds thread code is created before form that is updated. It seems that order of destruction is reverse to creation order.p  pI also added some code in form destructor to make sure thread is terminated if form is destroyed before form with the thread code. So rearranging form creation order andor code in form destructor solves the problem.p  pBut I have 3 questionsp  ol lipWhat is the order in which created forms are destroyed Is it reverse of the creation order as I assume nowpli lipIs there a better way to do the above task  update form GUI items after thread is done processing data. Right now I do it from thread itself using codeSynchronizecode but someone experienced with threads may have better idea. One other idea I had was to even remove a bunch of codeCreateFormcode generated by compiler and create them manually, only create main form using codeCreateFormcode to better control order of destruction as suggested by Rob Kennedy  a hrefhttppages.cs.wisc.edurkennedycreateform relnofollowhttppages.cs.wisc.edurkennedycreateforma.pli lipHow expensive is dynamic form creationdestruction in typical application Is it better to use form Hide and keep in memory or destroy it on closepli ol

Negative 60483 pA lot of programming languages have statements terminated by lineendings.  Usually, though, line endings are allowed in the middle of a statement if the parser cant make sense of the line for example, p  precodea  3  4 codepre  p...will be parsed in Ruby and Python as the statement codea  34code, since codea  3code doesnt make any sense.  In other words, the newline is ignored since it leads to a parsing error.p  pMy question is  how can I simplyelegantly accomplish that same behavior with a tokenizer and parser  Im using Lemon as a parser generator, if it makes any difference though Im also tagging this question as yacc since Im sure the solution applies equally to both programs.p  pHeres how Im doing it now  allow a statement terminator to occur optionally in any case where there wouldnt be syntactic ambiguity.  In other words, something likep  precodeexpression  identifier PLUS identifier statementterminator. expression  identifier PLUS statementterminator identifier statementterminator. codepre  p... in other words, its ok to use a newline after the plus because that wont have any effect on the ambiguity of the grammar.  My worry is that this would balloon the size of the grammar and I have a lot of opportunities to miss cases or introduce subtle bugs in the grammar.  Is there an easier way to do this  p  pEDIT  Actually, that code example wont work for Python.  Python does in fact ignore the newline if you pass in something like this, thoughp  precodeprint 1, 2, 3 codepre

Negative 60483 pIn my C code, if I create one tcl interp per thread, and use it to TclEvalEx a script, and get result by TclGetStringResult, is this thread safe p  pTheres no shared data between these threads except const data.p  pAfter some searching on google I found this in the tcl threading model doc a hrefhttpwww.tcl.tkdochowtothreadmodel.html relnofollowhttpwww.tcl.tkdochowtothreadmodel.htmlap  blockquote   pTcl lets you have one or more Tcl interpreters e.g., created with TclCreateInterp in each operating system thread. However, each interpreter is tightly bound to its OS thread and errors will occur if you let more than one thread call into the same interpreter e.g., with TclEval.p blockquote  pI guess that means if I dont shared data between interpreters, then there should be no issuep

Negative 60483 pI originally created a button that changed the src based on mouseup and mousedown to give it the appearance of being depressed when clicked as well as playing a click sound.  This worked out fine until I tried to force PDF download through MVC action.  Ive tried to skin this cat a few different ways but Ive settled on using the mouseup function to set the window location to my pdf download action passing in the needed file download path information.  Now when I click the button it depresses correctly executing mousedown, then on mouseup it correctly plays the click sound and also downloads the pdf file as I want, but makes the button image appear to be broken.p  pWhen I first load the page and the button hasnt been clicked yet the image looks like its supposed to.

Negative 60483 pIm trying to figure out the idiomatic way to structure models in Go but Im having trouble finding any samples for larger enterprise type apps just lots of Cats and Dogs that speak....  p  pI started off by putting each of my models into a separate package since that seemed to produce the cleanest API to use the modelsp  precodeimport modelsperson  person.New...      returns the newly created person person.GetById123  returns a single person person.GetAll      returns a list of people codepre  pHowever, then I ran into the problem that my models need to reference each other quite a bit. I ended up with packages that look like the followingp  precode File person.go package Person import modelsteam  type Person struct      Name string     Team Team   func p Person New... Person      ...    File team.go package Team import modelsperson  type Team struct      Name   string     People []Person   func t Team New... Team      ...  codepre  pThis doesnt work because now I have a cyclic reference. Should I just be adding all of these models to the same package so that the API looks like thisp  precodeimport model  model.NewPerson...      returns the newly created person model.GetPersonById123  returns a single person model.GetAllPeople      returns a list of people codepre  pOr should I be using interfaces to solve this and if so, what would they look likep  pI also have questions on how to handle things like database connections. How do people normally provide a database connection to their models either directly or through some intermediate object Does every call need to take an interface to some database as a parameter or is there a better way to do itp  pIs there a larger example of structuring a full Rest API in Go somewhere I found one example a hrefhttpmanuel.kiessling.net20120928applyingthecleanarchitecturetogoapplications relnofollowherea but its still pretty small and the author notes that he is a beginner at Go so Im not sure how much of that to trust.p  pThanks p

Negative 60483 pI have MVC3 application that draws some charts using gRaphael library. I use ajax to submit the input from client and as a response, I get Json that contains all the data needed to draw the charts. I know that server side rendering is faster and more preferable approach but i also know that gRaphael library doesnt support server rendering out of the box and it still needs some JavaScript to be executed on client side. I heard about PhantomJS as a work around but I am not familiar with it and i also heard that there are some issues using it for SVG rendering.p  pSo my questions are p  ol liShould i even try to find a solution to render those charts on server side Will i get major performance improvements by moving the rendering to server sideli ol  pAnd if i should, what is the best practice to do itp  pThanks in advancep

I can use something like codeforfiles d 07102013 c cmd c echo fnamecode to act on everything after 71013, but what I want is to just be able to calculate instead from 90 days before today.p  pIs there a syntax for the date calculation that will work in a cmd file that will let me specify x days before today to feed into FORFILESp  pI prefer to not use VBS and found a code snippet that would work in VBS, though I could alternatively rewrite my script for Powershell, but ideally I want to stick with cmd.p  pTo clarify, 90 would find all files older than 90 days 90 would find all files newer than 90 days after today which is fundamentally useless, as files are rarely written with future dates, and 7302013 will find all files newer than 7302013.  I want that last time period, preferably able to take a numberofdays variable passed to the CMD file, that would say after x number of days before today, i.e. in the last x days.  So instead of using the hardcoded date as shown above, I want to be able to calculate that date within the cmd file.p

Negative 60483 pI am currently using an app that just supports android phones. However, recently I decided to make a tablet version of the same. I created a folder layoutlarge and layoutxlarge for tablet versions, but someone mentioned that there are phones which are considered large and there are certain features in layouts that I want to keep just for the tablet and not for the phones. How do I make sure the phones are not taking in any layouts from layoutlarge but from my default layout folders Is there a way to make sure only tablets take in code for layouts under large and xlarge including fablets Also, some of my tablets are xlarge with density mdpi, but all the images in mdpi are shaped at a smaller resolution so they appear stretched on my tablet, how do I go about it Here is the code I added to recognize tabletsp  precodeboolean tabletSize  getResources.getBooleanR.bool.isTablet         if tabletSize              setRequestedOrientationActivityInfo.SCREENORIENTATIONFULLSENSOR          else              setRequestedOrientationActivityInfo.SCREENORIENTATIONPORTRAIT          codepre  pDo I need to manipulate it somehow to work for the tablets for layoutlargexlarge folders only any ideap

Negative 60483 pIm using the math library in combination with the JexlEngine to calculate different equations. In this equations I also have the codepowcode function. The problem is that when I have huge numbers like codemath.pow99999, 10000code, jexl tries to evaluate it and that takes a lot of time and CPU usage.

Negative 60483 pI am playing around with some data from a Kaggle competition on textanalysis, and I keep getting this rather weird error described in the title whenever I try to fit my algorithm.

I reckon this problem lies with my trainlabels below in the code, the labels consist of 24 columns which isnt very common to begin with, labels are floats between 0 and 1 including 0 and 1.

Negative 60483 pI have a presentation used for our new employee orientation that lists when specific forms are due. For example, Health Insurance form must be turned in 60 days from hire date. I would like the date to automatically update to be 60 days from the current date each time the presentation is ran. p  pI currently have a text box linked to an Excel spreadsheet which has a formula codeNOW60code. This works great, but it still does not update unless you first double click on the text box to activateopen the Excel spreadsheet, which then refreshes to the current date and updates the correct future date. p  pThis is not a workable solution however because in the first place there are about 6 different instances embedded in over 100 slides of these future dates that need to be double clicked and updated, and in the second place, I am not running the presentation myself, but instead a subject matter expert is, who is NOT technically savvy enough to even doubleclick text boxes to force a refresh. p  pI am hoping find code that would either insert a future date automatically directly into the PowerPoint text box or open and refresh the linked Excel objects each time the PowerPoint is opened. p  pAny help would be appreciated, thanks. p

A client now imposed as requirement to use Oracle as a database for a project. Im having trouble figuring out the Schema use in Oracle.p  pThe Postgresql database is divided in about 10 different schemas, plus separated schemas for the audit records. I define tables and schemas in the annotation. I.e.p  precodeEntity Tablename  language, schema  live Audited AuditTablevaluelanguageaud, schemaliveaud public class Language implements Serializable       Id     GeneratedValuestrategy  GenerationType.AUTO     Columnname  id     private Integer id etc... codepre  pThis works quite well in Postgres. To create the database I create manually the schemas firstp  precodeCREATE SCHEMA live codepre  pAnd then start the application with hibernate.hbm2ddl.autocreate. This works like a charm and the database is correctly built.p  pNow moving to Oracle I have problems with the schema definition. I tried the CREATE SCHEMA statement with no succes but then found out that in Oracle schemauser very strange to me but there must be a reason. So I created all the users to match the Schema structure. I.e.p  precodeCREATE USER live IDENTIFIED BY password codepre  p EDIT p  pBut this still doesnt work, when I run the application the tables are not created by hibernate I fixed the previous exception adding trycatch to postProcess methods, they failed as the database was not createdp  pI can get the connection correctly with Oracle, I use the parameterp  precodejdbc.driveroracle.jdbc.driver jdbc.urljdbcoraclethinlocalhost1521XE jdbc.usernamesystem jdbc.passwordpassword hibernate.dialectorg.hibernate.dialect.Oracle10gDialect codepre  pWhat I am doing wrong do I have to create the schemas in a different way or is the system user not to have the right privilegesp  pThe application is shared by many clients so a requirement I have is to try to avoid to change completely the structure removing the schemas. In a perfect world the application should be database indipendant so work with any database.p  pThank you for any help you can give and please ask if you need more info.p  pMattiap

Negative 60483 pIm using WireShark to capture network information for a little network analysis project.  One of the things I would like to do is look at what files have been accessed on shared drives that is, using the SMB protocol.p  pIs it possible to recover the full path name e.g. serverpathtofile.txt from only the captured packet  Based on a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibrarywindowsdesktopaa36523628vvs.8529.aspx relnofollowthisa resource, the fourth packet should contain the UNC path name, but Im not finding it anywhere in the captured session.p  pIf its not possible to recover the full path from the packet alone, is there some other way using hte information in the packet  I know, for example, that the packet contains the source IP and a file ID generated by source.

Those cells have one other thing in common their data validation lists, respectively, are   Category TableF2F31   and    Category TableF32F41p  pThe other four cells  which dont get the error  use a complicated dynamic range that references a different table on the Category Table sheet. I dont really think this has anything to do with my problem, but I dont see anything else those cells have in commonp  pIf no one can give me an answer, Id appreciate some advice on how to track down an intermittent problem.   p  pThanksp
Negative 60483 pThis is less of a plea for help over a problem, and more of a question about something peculiar discovered after solving a problem. I was working on my beginner OpenGL game and was attempting to write an OOP friendly rendering file. All vbo data was being stored in a model class, where it was uploaded and buffered in the constructor.p  pVastly simplified structure of this from main would look something likep  precodeint main     vector ltModelgt Models      Graphics.GLInit      Models.pushbackModelvertices,texcoords,36,0      Graphics.EnableAttributePointers      main loop              Graphics.drawModels,Textures,Entities          return 0  codepre  pConstructor looked likep  precodeModelModelvector ltvec3gt ampvertices,vector ltvec2gt amptexcoords,int NumVertices,int StartVertex      iNumVerticesNumVertices     iStartVertexStartVertex      Verticesvertices     Texcoordstexcoords      glGenBuffers1,ampvboVertex     glGenBuffers1,ampvboTexcoord     glBindBufferGLARRAYBUFFER,vboVertex     glBufferDataGLARRAYBUFFER,Vertices.size12,Vertices.data,GLSTATICDRAW     glBindBufferGLARRAYBUFFER,vboTexcoord     glBufferDataGLARRAYBUFFER,TexCoord.size8,TexCoord.data,GLSTATICDRAW  codepre  pUpon calling glDrawArrays in the drawing function a segmentation fault would occurp  precode0xC0000005 cannot access 0x00000000 yadda yadda. codepre  pSo I checked over everything countless times, making sure it all made sense. Eventually I tore apart the program, making a simpler version in which the same exact code is being used without a model class. That worked fine. Figuring something was wrong with the Model class, I eventually placed the buffering code into a separate function to be called directly after the constructor. This fixed it.p  pAnyways, all this begs the question of why the constructor was seemingly being called upon out of sequence before the GLInit code. That, or there is some behavioral quirk of constructors which I am unaware of, wherein the OpenGL state machine cannot be properly modified by them for some bizarre reason. My knowledge of C is only spare time highschooler level, so am I missing something obvious herep

Negative 60483 blockquote   pWe are given a subroutine which takes two positive int arguments and returns an int, lets say its codedef fm,n return mn2n2code.  The input values must be positive integers.  The returned value is increasing with respect to both of the inputs that is codefm,nltfm1,ncode and codefm,nltfm,n1code for all codemcode and all codencode.  We want to iterate over all possible pairs of codemcode and codencode in an order that gives the returned values in increasing order, until it passes a test.  We dont care about the test we know some pair of values will pass it, and we want the smallest returned value which passes.  We also dont know if the test will be passed in the first million values of codemcode and codencode each, so we cant just build the entire list of values and sort it.p      pHow do we iterate over codem,ncode in the correct order, reasonably efficientlyp blockquote  pI visualize this as a multiqueue, which cant be the right name what is it calledp  pI have an array codenextN[]code indexed by codem1code, storing the largest visited codencode for that codemcode. Another array codenextV[]code indexed by codem1code stores the returned value of codefm,nextN[m1]code so we dont call codefcode more than once for any pair this can be omitted as a preoptimization, but its a necessary optimization when codefcode takes a long time to run or has side effects.  At each step we take the smallest stored value and test it, and update those elements in the two arrays with the next value of codencode.p  pThe question is what data structures and methods should be used to make this multiqueue efficient and understandable  I have the quick hack, but I want a better, more understandable and maintainable solution.p  pIm writing in Python, but the same question applies to Java, C, etc.  Give your answer in whatever language you like.

Negative 60483 pWe are using maven in combination with the mavenfailsafeplugin to run our integration tests. This works fine, but we notice that some more long running tests are started at the end. This is not optimal because all other tests are finished while this longer running tests still takes minutes to finish. It would be more efficient to start these long running tasks first. p  pI notice that there is an runOrder option that can optimize this, but that uses analyses data from one test run that needs to be checked in. As we use git with a lot of branches this isnt really a good option. Also tests tend to run quite long when they are failing, when normally they are quite fast, so we are afraid these optimizations wont really work for us.p  pWhat we are looking for is a way to just specify the exact order in which to run our tests. With that I mean the order of the test classes, not the methods. We have about 25 classes, so it would be totally doable just to list them in the optimal order when they should be picked up. Is there currently a way to achieve thisp

Negative 60483 pIve recently asked the a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions21772317differencebetweenfunctionlevelscopeandblocklevelscopequestiona about the difference between the emfunction level scopeem and emblock level scopeem. The answer was comprehensive and helped me to understand the emfunction level scopeem and introduced the emhoistingem concept.p  pNow I have another deliberation. The example is a jQuery code.readycode function and an event handler declared within it. That is to say, why a variable declared in code.clickcode event handler is not being hoisted up to the code.readycode function  Is that because code.clickcode is not property of the code.readycode function  and the variable declared within code.clickcode is being hoisted only up to that functionp  pExamplep  precodedocument.readyfunction     selector.clickfunction         var x  10 discussed variable       codepre  pIm trying to teach JS script myself, but this concept is really hard for me to understand.

Negative 60483 pIm writing an implementation for MinimumDegree Ordering in MATLAB, which requires the use of graphs.  My first idea at implementing this algorithm was to represent each vertex in a graph as an object, and to keep an adjacency list as a property of each vertex.  This leads me to the following questionsp  p1  How can I keep track of other vertex objects within any particular vertex object  As in, if I want to keep a list of adjacent vertices, how can I reference them within a list thats part of another vertex  How can I update each list as vertices are deletedp  p2  How can I remove an object altogetherp  pIm familiar with the basics of OOP, but this would be my first attempt at using it to implement anything in any language, so Im trying to work out the specifics of implementing such an algorithm.p

Negative 60483 pIn Domain Driven Design literature it is often said that domain services should be stateless.p  pI believe the reason for this is because service calls should represent single units of work.  There shouldnt be any service state which multiple service methods would use. p  pI break this rule in my service architecture so that I can constructor inject all the relevant repositories required in the service.

Perform relevant domain logic            ...  codepre  pIn order for me to use constructor injection on the codeUserServicecode, I would need to have state properties so that the service methods have access to the relevant repositories and such.  p  pAlthough I hope to design the individual service methods as isolated units of work, I cannot necessarily prevent that from happening.p  pstrongHow could I architecture domain services so that they are statelessstrong  Is this even necessaryp  pstrongEDITstrongp  pstrongEric Evansstrong in a hrefhttprads.stackoverflow.comamznclick0321125215 relnofollowDomaindriven Design Tackling Complexity in the Heart of Softwareap  blockquote   pWhen a significant process or transformation in the domain is not a   natural responsibility of an ENTITY or VALUE OBJECT, add an operation   to the model as standalone interface declared as a SERVICE.

Negative 60483 pIm new to AngularJS and I would like to understand how to properly separate the model from the controller. Till now Ive always worked with the models inside the controllers. For instance p  precodeangular.moduleapp.controllercustomerController, [Customer, scope, routeParams,     function Customer, scope, routeParams         scope.customer  Customer.findIDrouteParams.ID ] codepre  pThis function retrieves a customer from the database and exposes that customer to the view. But I would like to go further for example I could have the necessity to ecapsulate something or create some useful functions to abstract from the row data contained in the database. Something likep  precodecustomer.getName  function     return customername  customersurname  customer.save  function     save the customer in the database after some modifies  codepre  pI want to create a model for the Customer and reuse that model in lots of controllers. Maybe I could then create a List for the customers with methods to retrieve all customers from the database or something else. p  pIn conclusion I would like to have a model that reflects a database entity like the customer above with properties and methods to interact with. And maybe a factory that creates a Customer or a list of Customers. How can I achieve a task like this in AngularJS I would like to receive some advices for this issue from you. A simple example will be very useful or a theoretical answer that helps me to undestand the right method to approch issues like these in Angular. Thanks and good luck with your work. p

Negative 60483 pstrongBackgroundstrongp  pIm writing an application which finds events within a certain radius of a zip code. You can think of this like ticketmaster, where you type in your zip code and all of the concerts in the radius of x show up.p  pI have a database table which has the zip code, and each zip codes Latitude and Longitude. I also have an EventListings table where each Event has a ZipCode field.p  pstrongProblemstrongp  pCurrently, Im using the Haversine formula in a LinqtoEntities query in my service layer to find which events are within the radius. Right now, Im using it as a filter in the where clause. Id also like to place it in the select clause so on the website I can show this is 4.6 miles away, etc. p  pI cant move this code into a separate C method because LinqtoEntities will complain that it cant convert it to sql, so that leaves me with duplicating the entire formula in the select statement too. This is very ugly. I tried to fix it.p  pstrongWhat Ive Triedstrongp  pI edited the Entity, and added a special scalar property of DistanceFromOrigin. I then created a stored procedure which brought back all the entity data, plus a hard coded value for testing purposes for the new field DistanceFromOrigin.p  pI then came to realize that I cant tell entity framework to use my sproc for its select statement on the EventListings entity...  Phil suggested spatials, so thats what I went with.p  pstrongQuestionstrongp  pHow can I use Spatials to search for events within a radius of zip codesp

Negative 60483 pIve built a tool to automate visual regression as part of an E2E test suite and while it works fine under most situations I have encountered a problem trying to measure visual regression with auto playing HTML5 videos.p  pAs a video is a moving target for the screenshots and the Browserstack session is always reliant on Browserstacks server speed there is rarely going to be a situation where the screenshots taken after the screen has loaded will be a close enough to serve as a reliable source for a visual regression test. In a build process most of the time there will be a 90 visual difference.p  pOne solution would be to point my visual regression tool at a videooff or a testtrue url but I would also like to explore executing javascript on the active browser session in BrowserStack to use the HTML5 video to stop and set the frame of the video to a fixed point to act as a more reliable source of visual regression.p  pIs there anything similar to the execute function of a hrefhttpsgithub.comcammewebdriverjs relnofollowcammes versiona of webdriverjs inside the browserstackwebdriver as this feels like there could be a few scenarios where specific JS might need to execute to make the most out of visual regression testing.p

Negative 60483 pSo usually when I make mockup programs like this one I look for things I can improve on in case the situation happens again. p  pToday I thought Id brush up on basic OOP I understand the concept of OOP, just havent messed around with it for a bit and wanted to freshen my memory. So I decided to make a little game that just creates 3 monsters on a 10x10 plane and 1 player you, you are able to move your player in any xy direction. My program works but I cant help but feel that Im doing something incorrectly.p  pSo the basic layout of my program was to have 5 classes. A GUI class that shows the game and gives you directional buttons for movement control, a class that creates the monsters, a class that creates the players, a class that creates the 10x10 board and keeps track of monsterplayer locations, and of course a main class that creates all the objects and has the main game loop and whatnot.p  pI was having a bit of a hard time interacting with my main class and my GUI class. What I ended up doing was doing a while loop in my main class and waiting until the player presses the start button, and once the player presses it via action listener the GUI class sets a public variable running from false to true, and I am able to act accordingly once the variable is changed. p  pHERE is where I feel like I am doing something wrong At first my while loop would not terminate unless I printed out to the console. I Googled the issue and apparently people have said that its some sort of issue with threading or active polling, which I did not understand. I went to my program and added a small 10ms thread sleep in my while loops and everything started working great.p  pMy question to you guys is, what is active polling Why is it bad Howwhywhere was this going on in my program And finally if theres a better way of interacting with a GUI class and a main class. Sorry for the giant wall of text but I like to be thorough when explaining a situationp  pTLDR Am I interacting correctly with my GUI class and my main class If not what is the proper way to do itp  pMy main classp  precodepublic class MainGame   public static void mainString[] args throws InterruptedException     ShowGUI gui  new ShowGUI      whilegui.running         Thread.sleep10           Board gameBoard  new Board     gui.setLabelTextgameBoard.getBoard      Add Player     Player playerOne  new Player1000, Player 1      Add monsters     Monster monstMatt  new Monster1000, Matt     Monster monstJon  new Monster1000, Jon     Monster monstAbaad  new Monster1000, Abaad      whilegui.running         Thread.sleep10          int x, y         x  playerOne.getX         y  playerOne.getY          ifgui.buttonPress  1             ifgui.buttonPress  1                 playerOne.movex, y             else ifgui.buttonPress  2                 playerOne.movex, y             else ifgui.buttonPress  3                 playerOne.movex, y             else ifgui.buttonPress  4                 playerOne.movex, y                          gui.buttonPress  1             gui.setLabelTextgameBoard.getBoard                  codepre  pp  pMy GUI Classp  precodepublic class ShowGUI  private JTextArea board private JButton moveUp private JButton moveDown private JButton moveLeft private JButton moveRight  public boolean running  false public int buttonPress  1  public ShowGUI     System.out.printlnGUI Successfully Loaded     createAndShow   private void createAndShow     JFrame mainFrame  new JFrameBad Game      addComponentsmainFrame.getContentPane      mainFrame.setSize500, 400     mainFrame.setDefaultCloseOperationJFrame.EXITONCLOSE     mainFrame.setLocationRelativeTonull     mainFrame.setResizablefalse     mainFrame.setVisibletrue   private void addComponentsContainer pane     pane.setLayoutnull      board  new JTextArea1, JLabel.CENTER     moveUp  new JButtonUp     moveDown  new JButtonDown     moveLeft  new JButtonLeft     moveRight  new JButtonRight      moveUp.setBounds185, 225, 130, 35     moveLeft.setBounds115, 280, 130, 35     moveRight.setBounds255, 280, 130, 35     moveDown.setBounds185, 335, 130, 35      board.setEditablefalse     board.setBounds115, 30, 270, 145     board.setFontnew FontConsolas, Font.BOLD, 12      addActionListeners      pane.addboard     pane.addmoveUp     pane.addmoveRight     pane.addmoveLeft     pane.addmoveDown   private void addActionListeners     moveUp.addActionListenernew ActionListener          public void actionPerformedActionEvent e              running  true             buttonPress  1                   moveDown.addActionListenernew ActionListener          public void actionPerformedActionEvent e              buttonPress  2                   moveLeft.addActionListenernew ActionListener          public void actionPerformedActionEvent e              buttonPress  3                   moveRight.addActionListenernew ActionListener          public void actionPerformedActionEvent e              buttonPress  4                  public void setLabelTextchar[][] boardToShow     board.setText      forint i  0 i lt boardToShow.length i         forint j  0 j lt boardToShow[i].length j             board.appendboardToShow[i][j]                       board.appendn        codepre  pp  pIf you require my BoardMonsterPlayer classes I can post them, but I dont think the problem is with those classes.p

Once the user has selected a project, that project is availible globally throughout the entire app and the codeMasterViewControllercode should reload its items based on that. So whenever the codeViewControllercode is dismissed and the codeSplitViewControllercode is visible again, I need to make the codeMasterViewControllercode reload. How is this possible in a simple wayp

Negative 60483 pIve been playing around with encryption in Java, and I bumped upon strange behavior. When encrypting a codebyte[] datacode using p  precodeInputStream fin  new ByteArrayInputStreamdata CipherInputStream cin  new CipherInputStreamfin, mEcipher codepre  pwhere mEcipher is a wellinitialized AES cipher, this works always emexceptem when the length of the array is a multiple of 16. Then the encryption skips the last 16 bytes. I have to workaround it by adding an additional 16 0s, which cant be the intention since the encryption is done per block of 16 bytes so there is no need for the last bytes to be 0.p  pBelow is a small example that demonstrates the behavior. Why is this happening and how can I fix it It is only happening with encryption, decryption works fine and there the length is always a multiple of 16.

Negative 60483 pI was thinking about a project on distribution management.p  pSuppose I have a central database that contains all the sales info of the products manufactured by my company. I populate this database with fresh data from the distributors on fixed regular intervals.p  pThere are other local databases installed on the systems of the distributors. There are certain interfaces made on Java EE Platform through which they access their respective local database. Every week the distributors have to sync their databases with ours. When a distributor syncs with the database, our sales records get updated.p  pThe distributor shouldnt show sales for a back date. But, suppose, a distributor does that by changing his system date to add a sales invoice of back date to his local database. Then he syncs his database with ours and that sale gets reflected in our database.p  pHow can I as a programmer prevent him from doing that provided that the interface is made by me.p
Negative 60483 pWhen I try to build my solution consisting of a WPF project C, a test project and the installShield install project I get the error that Visual studio has stopped working and after a while Visual studio is restarting.p  pIm using Visual Studio 2012 Profesional and InstallShield LE.  p  pIt used to work just fine and I have no idea why it stopped working, I do not get any sort of indications where the problem might lie. Ive tried clean solution and rebuild but it does not solve the problem.

Negative 60483 pIt has recently happened that a coworker, after completing some minor changes to the Stable branch of our solution, accidentally checkedin some of his unfinished work on the Development branch as well. TFS bundled it all up as a single changeset.p  pWhile the mistake was easily detected and fixed, I feel like I am missing something critical here. Why would TFSs Pending changes page allow you and, worse, offer by default to create a single changeset containing everything youve done on every branchp  pIt seems to me that a changeset should consist of changes to one emand only one branchem, so you can more effectively managemergerollback them as necessary, without affecting other branches. If you have been working on multiple branches at the same time, upon checkingin it should ask you to insert multiple descriptions, and create multiple changesets as a result.p  pemAssuming my reasoning is at least validem if not necessarily universal, is there a way to configure TFS so that users may not checkin changes to more than one branch at a timep  pEDIT Failing that, I would appreciate a way to at least set the Pending Changes page to put all changed files by default in the Excluded section, so users will need to manually include them before checking in which would help them notice any accidental changes.p

Negative 60483 pI have an asp.net web application where its web server is located at client site. We have multiple client sites with their own web server.

I know, I know, the biggest and the most embarrassing blunder in my work history.p  pTherefore, now I want to hide at least the password, or better yet the connection string. Ive googled and read about codeaspnetregiis.execode. I believe codeaspnetregiis.execode is not the best option for my case given the clientuser has full access to the IIS, thus, with some googling, they can easily decrypt the connection string. p  pWhile there is an option to programmatically build the connection string, it requires too much changes on my current code. Most of my web pages use datasource that rely on the connection string. If I were to programmatically build the connection string, I will need to dynamically initialize the datasource. This is all well except I will lose the ViewState data and user input everytime there is a postback. I can manually persists the user input, but I still couldnt 100 emulate the data from ViewState, not to mention the huge changes needed to be done to the current code.p  pHence Im looking for a way to hide the password or move the connectionString somewhere where it can be hidden.p  pPlease help.

Negative 60483 pWe run about 30 webapps on various Tomcat instances behind load balancers and Apache reverse proxies using modjk.

On top of that I would like to add that I have read Androguard tutorial, and other tools READ ME FILES and MANUALS and there is no comprehensive guide to create CFG specially for newbies like me. p  pI have installed Santoku distribution  a hrefhttpssantokulinux.com relnofollowhttpssantokulinux.coma on my system to do android reverse engineering. It has some RE tools installed like Androguard, APKtool and .... I need your help to find a practical solution to generate CFG of android applications. Preferably using these preinstalled tools  p  pI would have to say that I need CFG to feed into Machine Learning Approaches like Kernel Method SVM. I would really appreciate if you have any experience in this regard, share it with mme and others who might have such a question in the future  . Any suggestion and recommendation in a comprehensive way are welcomed. Thanks for your assistance and support in advance.  p

Negative 60483 pphpBB has many static resources and serving them from a different server than the dynamic forums server could mean a notable performance increase.

Negative 60483 pSo for some reason I am having trouble grasping the complete concept on why the Test and Test and Set function would work faster then the Test and set function from the book named in the title. Let me elaborate.......p  pIn the above referenced book in the appendix it goes into the computer architecture a very little bit. I have a fairly good grasp of this already. It goes on to summarize that the TTAS is faster than the TAS function because of caching. I dont see how or why this is. Wont the TTAS function cache similarly to the TAS function. What part of the TAS function is causing it to work longer or what causes the TTAS function to work shorter.p

Negative 60483 pI may be missing something obvious here.  Im new to both MVC and Web API, so Im working on keeping my head above water.p  pI have an MVC application that interfaces with a Web API service.  Authentication will be handled by a login service developed internally.  When working, the MVC client should check if the current user is authenticated.

Negative 60483 pIm banging my head against a wall here... I cant figure out why this isnt working...  I have an android app that basically uses three activities codeMainActivitycode, codeSummaryViewercode and codeWebViewercode.  The codeMainActivitycode basically consists of four buttons the user can press.  Based on which button is pressed, codeSummaryViewercode should start, and corresponding content is displayed in two TextViews within codeSummaryViewercode.  The four buttons are People, Places, Events and Things.  p  pContent for the codeSummaryViewercode class is stored in four different object arrays, with a corresponding name i.e., mPeople[], mPlaces[], etc..  In codeMainActivitycode I have an codeonClickListenercode set up for each of the four buttons.  Within each codeonClickListercode, I have a call to a codesetNumTypecode and an Intent that starts the codeSummaryViewercode activity.  Each button does the same thing with regard to calling codeSummaryViewercode, but I pass a different integer to codesetNumTypecode, depending on which button is pressed.  So if the People button is pressed, I call codesetNumType1code, which sets the variable codenumTypecode to 1.  If Places is pressed, I call codesetNumType2code and so on.  p  pHeres the code from my MainActivity Class p  precodepublic class MainActivity extends ActionBarActivity   private Button placesButton  private Button peopleButton  private Button eventsButton  private Button thingsButton  private int type    public int getNumType     return type    public void setNumTypeint i     type  i    Override protected void onCreateBundle savedInstanceState      super.onCreatesavedInstanceState     setContentViewR.layout.activitymain      placesButton  ButtonfindViewByIdR.id.placesbutton      placesButton.setOnClickListenernew View.OnClickListener           Override         public void onClickView v              setNumType1               Intent openSumViewerClass  new Intentcom.tierramaxis.interestingwikipedia.SUMMARYVIEWER              startActivityopenSumViewerClass                    peopleButton  ButtonfindViewByIdR.id.peoplebutton      peopleButton.setOnClickListenernew View.OnClickListener           Override         public void onClickView v              setNumType2              Intent openSumViewerClass  new Intentcom.example.SUMMARYVIEWER              startActivityopenSumViewerClass                    eventsButton  ButtonfindViewByIdR.id.eventsbutton      eventsButton.setOnClickListenernew View.OnClickListener           Override         public void onClickView v              setNumType3              Intent openSumViewerClass  new Intentcom.exmaple.SUMMARYVIEWER              startActivityopenSumViewerClass                    thingsButton  ButtonfindViewByIdR.id.thingsbutton      thingsButton.setOnClickListenernew View.OnClickListener           Override         public void onClickView v              setNumType4              Intent openSumViewerClass  new Intentcom.exmple.SUMMARYVIEWER              startActivityopenSumViewerClass                codepre  pIn codeSummaryViewercode, I access the codenumTypecode variable, via an object of codeMainActivitycode, and set it equal to codetypecode.  codetypecode then gets passed to two switch statements with corresponding methods and sets the content of the TextViews depending on the value of codetypecode.  Basically it calls a different object array based upon whether codetypecode is 1, 2, 3 or 4.  Heres the relevant code from my SummaryViewer Class p  precodepublic class SummaryViewer extends Activity   private Button mNextButton  private Button mPrevButton  private Button mGoButton  private TextView mArticleTitle  private TextView mArticleSummary  MainActivity numType  new MainActivity   private int type  numType.getNumType  bunch of object arrays for content go in here...  private static int mCurrentIndex  1  private void updateTitle     int title  0       switch type      case 1 title  mInterestingPlaces[mCurrentIndex].getTitle      mArticleTitle.setTexttitle      break      case 2 title  mInterestingPeople[mCurrentIndex].getTitle      mArticleTitle.setTexttitle      break      case 3 title  mInterestingEvents[mCurrentIndex].getTitle      mArticleTitle.setTexttitle      break      case 4 title  mInterestingThings[mCurrentIndex].getTitle      mArticleTitle.setTexttitle      break         private void updateSummary     int summary  0       switch type      case 1 summary  mInterestingPlaces[mCurrentIndex].getSummary      mArticleSummary.setTextsummary      break      case 2 summary  mInterestingPeople[mCurrentIndex].getSummary      mArticleSummary.setTextsummary      break      case 3 summary  mInterestingEvents[mCurrentIndex].getSummary      mArticleSummary.setTextsummary      break      case 4 summary  mInterestingThings[mCurrentIndex].getSummary      mArticleSummary.setTextsummary      break         public static String updateURL      this works differently, so Ive omitted it to avoid confusion.

When I run the app, everything works, but the TextViews in codeSummaryViewercodeare blank.  If I set codenumTypecode manually i.e., initialize it in codeMainActivitycode, the variable does get passed, becuase the TextViews in codeSummaryActivitycode contain the appropriate content.  For example, if I initialize codeprivate int numType  3code in codeMainActivitycode then the content in codeSummaryViewercode corresponds with codemEventscode, regardless of which button gets pressed.  p  pSo it looks to me like the variable codenumTypecode is not being set as it should be based upon each call to codeonClickListenercode in codeMainActivitycodep  pCan someone please help me with this  Ive spent a ridiculous amount of time trying to figure it out.  p

How can I account for personal effects, e.g., gender and region I have followed examples e.g. a hrefhttpfinzi.psych.upenn.eduRlibraryVGAMhtmldirmul.old.html relnofollow titlefitting with vglmfitting with vglma  but I still dont understand how to apply this to my problem. p  precodedata lt structurelistId  143, Gender  structurec2L, 2L, 2L, 1L,  2L, 2L, 2L, 2L, 2L, 1L, 2L, 1L, 1L, 1L, 2L, 2L, 1L, 1L, 2L, 2L,  1L, 2L, 2L, 2L, 1L, 1L, 1L, 1L, 2L, 2L, 1L, 1L, 2L, 2L, 1L, 2L,  2L, 2L, 2L, 1L, 2L, 2L, 1L, .Label  cFemale, Male, class  factor,      Region  c5L, 5L, 1L, 2L, 1L, 5L, 2L, 5L, 5L, 1L, 1L, 2L,      1L, 2L, 3L, 1L, 5L, 2L, 5L, 3L, 1L, 2L, 3L, 1L, 1L, 4L, 5L,      2L, 4L, 4L, 5L, 3L, 2L, 1L, 4L, 5L, 1L, 1L, 3L, 5L, 2L, 1L,      4L, K1  c3L, 4L, 1L, 1L, 1L, 2L, 2L, 1L, 5L, 1L, 3L, 1L,      1L, 1L, 2L, 3L, 3L, 1L, 1L, 1L, 1L, 1L, 3L, 1L, 1L, 4L, 2L,      1L, 1L, 1L, 1L, 2L, 2L, 1L, 3L, 2L, 4L, 2L, 1L, 1L, 5L, 1L,      3L, K2  c3L, 1L, 3L, 3L, 4L, 2L, 2L, 1L, 4L, 1L, 5L, 3L,      2L, 2L, 3L, 3L, 5L, 2L, 4L, 2L, 4L, 5L, 5L, 3L, 2L, 3L, 3L,      3L, 2L, 2L, 3L, 3L, 3L, 2L, 5L, 5L, 2L, 1L, 4L, 3L, 1L, 2L,      2L, K3  c3L, 4L, 5L, 2L, 3L, 3L, 4L, 4L, 4L, 3L, 4L, 4L,      3L, 5L, 4L, 3L, 3L, 2L, 3L, 3L, 4L, 4L, 3L, 4L, 4L, 3L, 5L,      3L, 4L, 3L, 5L, 2L, 2L, 4L, 3L, 4L, 4L, 4L, 2L, 4L, 5L, 3L,      1L, K4  c4L, 3L, 3L, 3L, 3L, 3L, 2L, 2L, 3L, 3L, 1L, 2L,      1L, 2L, 2L, 3L, 1L, 3L, 3L, 3L, 4L, 3L, 2L, 2L, 2L, 3L, 3L,      3L, 2L, 3L, 3L, 4L, 3L, 2L, 2L, 2L, 3L, 3L, 2L, 2L, 3L, 3L,      2L, K5  c3L, 5L, 5L, 5L, 2L, 1L, 2L, 5L, 5L, 4L, 5L, 5L,      5L, 1L, 4L, 2L, 4L, 3L, 3L, 3L, 3L, 2L, 1L, 4L, 2L, 5L, 4L,      5L, 5L, 3L, 3L, 5L, 4L, 2L, 4L, 2L, 1L, 3L, 5L, 4L, 5L, 1L,      5L, K6  c2L, 2L, 1L, 1L, 2L, 1L, 2L, 1L, 2L, 3L, 2L, 1L,      2L, 1L, 1L, 2L, 2L, 2L, 2L, 1L, 3L, 1L, 2L, 1L, 2L, 1L, 2L,      1L, 1L, 2L, 1L, 1L, 1L, 1L, 2L, 1L, 1L, 1L, 2L, 2L, 2L, 1L,      2L, .Names  cId, Gender, Region, K1, K2, K3,  K4, K5, K6, class  data.frame, row.names  cNA, 43L    response lt data[, 49] standardize responses G lt applyresponse, 1, scale Qcor lt corresponse get correlations among questions ab lt matrixvarG, Qcor, nrow43  model    alpha[1] lt 5 alpha[6] lt 10 alpha[2] lt 1.5   alpha[3] lt 2.5 alpha[4] lt 3.5 alpha[5] lt 4.5   considers extremities of responses    fori in 1n      forj in 1m        lo[i, j] lt alpha[x[i, j]]  3b[i]  3  a[i]       up[i, j] lt alpha[x[i, j]  1]  3b[i]  3  a[i]            fori in 1n      z[i, 1m]  dmnormmu[], G[, ]Ilo[i, ], up[i, ]        priors for mu and sigma   fori in 1m      mu[i]  dunif0, 6      G[1m, 1m]  dwishR[, ], m   varcov[1m, 1m] lt inverseG[, ]   forj in 1m      cor[j, j] lt varcov[j, j]      fori in 1m1      forj in i  1m        cor[i, j] lt varcov[i, j]  sqrtvarcov[i, i]  varcov[j, j]       cor[j, i] lt cor[i, j]             DP Priors for as and bs  using stickbreaking algorithm   fori in 1n      a[i] lt aa[i, 1]     b[i] lt aa[i, 2]      forj in 1n      for kk in 12        aa[j, kk] lt theta1[latent[j], kk]           fori in 1n      latent[i]  dcatpi[1L1]       pi[1] lt r[1]   forj in 2L11      logpi[j] lt logr[j]  sumR1[j, 1j1]     forl in 1j1        R1[j, l] lt log1  r[l]         pi[L1] lt 1sumpi[1L1  1]   forj in 1L1      r[j]  dbeta1, mm        the baseline distribution   fori in 1L1      theta1[i, 12]  dmnormzero[12], Sab[12, 12]ILB[],       zero[1] lt 0 zero[2] lt 1   Sab[12, 12]  dwishOmega[12, 12], 2   varcovab[12, 12] lt inverseSab[, ]   corab lt varcovab[1, 2]  sqrtvarcovab[1, 1]  varcovab[2, 2]     prior for concentration parameter   mm  dunif0.4, 10   codepreli ol

Negative 60483 pI have been converting my application to use SQLite and the SQLite Entity Framework 6 provider from a different database.

For every event, I use a countdown  so on the page is shown how much time hours, minutes and seconds left to the beginning of the event.p  pI am in the Netherlands 1h, so when I create an event and set its start on March 29th, 1945 and then look to the database, I see there following the column is codedatetimecodep  precode20150329 194500 codepre  pBut when I load the page, it shows that the event will start always in 1 more hour. How to handle this behaviorp  pAlso, I wanted to ask one more thing  lets say I set start of an event on 1945h. How to ensure that someone browsing my website in California thats 9 hours behind the Netherlands will see the proper time this person should see beginning of the event on 1045 and not 1945.p  pThank you, I havent been doing some serious work with timezones.p  pPS the server I use for the app is located in Amsterdam a DigitalOcean server.p

In particular,  extended characters are normalized to UCNs in the very first phase of translation, described belowp  pstrong C11 2.2p1.1strongp  blockquote   pPhysical source file characters are mapped, in an   implementationdefined manner, to the basic source character set   introducing newline characters for endofline indicators if   necessary.

Any source   file character not in the basic source character set 2.3 is replaced   by the universalcharactername that designates that character. An   implementation may use any internal encoding, so long as an actual   extended character encountered in the source file, and the same   extended character expressed in the source file as a   universalcharactername i.e., using the uXXXX notation, are   handled equivalently except where this replacement is reverted in a   raw string literal.p blockquote  hr  h3Questionh3  pemMy question, therefore, isemp  blockquote   pDoes a Standardconforming compilation of the programp  precodeinclude ltstdio.hgt  int mainvoid         printfn         printfu00e9n         return 0  codepre      pfail, compile and printp  precode  codepre      por compile and printp  precodeu00e9 u00e9 codepre      p, when runp blockquote  hr  h3Informed Personal Opinionh3  pIt is my contention that the answer is that it successfully compiles and prints codeu00e9code, since by 2.2p1.1 above, we havep  pemAn implementation may use any internal encoding, strongso long as an actual extended character encountered in the source filestrong, and strongthe same extended character expressed in the source file as a universalcharacternamestrong i.e., strongusing the uXXXX notationstrong, are handled strongequivalentlystrong except where this replacement is reverted in a raw string literal.em, and we are not in a raw string literal.p  pIt then follows thatp  ul liIn Phase 1, codeprintfncode maps to codeprintfu00e9ncode.li liIn Phase 3, emThe source file is decomposed into preprocessing tokensem 2.2p1.3, of which the emstringliteralem codeu00e9ncode is one.li liIn Phase 5, emEach source character set member in a character literal or a string literal, as well as each escape sequence and universalcharactername in a character literal or a nonraw string literal, is converted to the corresponding member of the execution character setem 2.2p1.5.

Negative 60483 pPlease let me point out the elefant in the room All current free CMS systems, especially the ones written in PHP, require you to install them on your live server, with all the security issues they come with, for, as I feel, no reason.p  pI think every CMS should be capable of deploying a static version of the site on a remote server via some file transfer protocol like FTP, SFTP, WebDAV, shares, simple file IO, whatever. p  pThink about the benefits p  ul liEvery security issue that comes with the CMS is irrelevant on your site. There does not need to be a link back to the CMS from the live site. Your CMS could be in a private network, home server or on a single locked down server managing multiple sites. li liStatic content can be static. Dynamic content can still be generated on the live site, it is just implemented in the template instead. Simple things like comment systems, banner rotations, etc. can be kept simple and modular and any security issues or breaches will not impact the CMS. Simple small modules are easier to secure. As there is no upload, edit or any management feature on the live site it can not be misused.li liDeploying to multiple domains, managing multiple sites while sharing data e.g. media, documents, downloads is suddenly simple. Multiple sites in multiple languages can be edited at once. Assets can be shared and deployed to a separate CDN.li liThe CMS could be shut down or disabled until you need it think Amazon or Azure VM. It could be distributed as a preinstalled VM image.li liUser management strictly differentiates between editors and admins on the CMS and visitors on the live server. Workflows and versioning can be provided on the CMS.li liAdditional steps like minification can be done on deployment.li liThe live server can be as fast, as thin or as locked down as you want. Support for load balancing is trivial.li liNo need to back up your live sites, only the CMS server has to be backed up. Something happened to your live server Wipe amp redeploy.li liNice URLs without rewriting.li liMany, many more. Divide and conquer is one of the basic strategies in SW development. Large monolithic systems have always been more problematic.li ul  pWhat you loose is the ability to edit your site on the site directly. I think considering the benefits above this is a very small inconvenience.p  pPutting together the CMS and the live site just does not seem right to me. What is the reason for what seems to be a generic limitation on pretty much all the free CMSs out there Did I miss something Is live inline editing really that much of a killer feature that trumps security concerns and a huge administration overheadp

Negative 60483 pI have a program which uses a hashtable and chaining to save a maximum of 100.000 strings. Each string has a maximum length of 20 and is made of a mix of az and 19 and is unique. p  pTo save it into the hashtable I convert the strings to a number by adding up the ASCII values of their characters. This means the highest number possible is 2440 20 times z.p  pI am having trouble thinking of the best hash function for this algorithm efficiency wise. I have searched on Google and I havent found a lot of detailed information about how to find the best hash function.p  pI have tried using hash  m in which m is a prime number as a hashfunction   but my program is still quite slow. p
Negative 60483 pI am currently upgrading our companys Line of Business Application some of you remember the buzz about Silverlight in 2009 at PDC in Los Angeles, right and I would like to know if anybody knows where the supported Microsoft versions of the following endp  pVS2013 how about VS2015 MVVM Light Silverlight 5 Silverlight 5 Toolkit Entity Framework 5.0 .NET Framework 4.5.1 will it work on the Microsoft mandated .NET Framework 4.5.2p  pAre we stuck using VS2012 So far I can build and run in VS2013, but have received occasional exceptions. Im just getting wound up with this upgrade, so Ill be glad to supply any exceptions that occur.

Negative 60483 pI need to stream a set of numbers, 6 floats, from an android device to a PC, to which it is connected by a USB cable. All the solutions I have found proposes using a WiFi connection. However, I have found that the latency caused by this is not acceptable. As such I have decided that I am going to hire someone to integrate the components, thus enabling direct communication. Until then, however, I want to try a variety of devices to see what works and the quickest way to Integrate two devices is by allowing them to share a USBuss. However, this is the one field I have zero experience with. p  pDo you make a socket and treat the connection as a network connection or is there another fancier way to achieve what I want I have seen some talk about making a device driver for this purpose and I do not feel like crashing my OS 500 times again. I find it hard to believe that the android devices do not have some kind of driver already made that I can exploit. p  pThe android code is written in Java, but it could be changed depending on what people suggest. The main chunk of mys system lies on the PC and is written in C. p  pI need the latency of the stream to be as low as possible since the entire system needs to be as real time as possible. The limit is 15 ms between data acquisition on the device and the rendering of the simulation on the PC.p  pTLDR I need to stream data from a program on an android device to a PC with as little latency as possible i.e. one way communication. As long as I can stream bytes I can design protocols and translate the bytes on the receiving end. My global cap is 15 ms and I need to stream continually updated 6 floats. What is the best way to achieve thisp  pThank you in advance for your help.p

Negative 60483 pI have three classes codeTrenchcode, codeWatercode and codePoolcode. Now codePoolcode shall be a fusion of codeWatercode and codeTrenchcode so that I can cast between these Types, for instance I want to cast an object of codePoolcode into an object of codeTrenchcode, because all properties of codeWatercode are being removed. First I thought about making codePoolcode easily inherit from both codeTrenchcode and codeWatercode. I just found out, that this is not possible in Java. p  pNow whats an alternative so that I can cast between the classes as I have mentioned Ive read about using interfaces in Java as alternative for multiple inheritance, but does this casting, how i want it, work when using interfaces I havent completely got it.p
Negative 60483 pI am trying to use the results of LLVMs builtin MemoryDependenceAnalysis MDA in a custom LLVM pass that Im working on. Given some instruction which reads from memory a codeloadcode, for example, id like MDA to tell me all of the previous instructions which may have Defined or Clobbered it. If my understanding of the MDA documentation serves me correctly, MDA should be able to give me this info. However, Im having a hard time getting the precision that I need out of it.

Negative 60483 pThe website I am building holds 571 houses with information about each house. Each house has a image associated with it. The information is coming from a SQL database table called houses. I am using a custom pager to filter the 571 houses with 5 results per page. I am using a repeater control to do this so I dont have multiple aspx pages. My question is I want to store the folder with the 571 images in a location stored on a network drive and set a path to the specific image in that folder for each house in the database table column called image and display the images for each house while using the repeater control.

Negative 60483 pI am beginner in using CAS and im using it in one of my project to use its Single Sign On services. Till now i have implemented Single sign on, I have one JAVA client and a PHP Client. But for using Single Sign Out functionality i configured my running CAS according to a hrefhttpjasig.github.iocasdevelopmentinstallationLogoutSingleSignout.html relnofollowCAS documentationa. I have done all the changes in the deployerConfigContext.xml of my working CAS. My CAS is up running, but on logging out it doesnt show any SAML logout request. Im using Official PHP Client and Java Client made by me. I think it may be due to these lines which im not able to configure it in my Client side. p  blockquote   pThe way the notification is done back or front channel is configured at a service level through the logoutType property. This value is set to LogoutType.BACKCHANNEL by default.p blockquote  pIm not able to understand by this line where actually i had to set the Logouttype to BACKCHANNEL, if its my Client then why is it that it is set to BACKCHANNEL by default as a Client can be made by anyone.p  pAny help is highly appreciated. Thanks in Advance.p

Negative 60483 pI have created a .pfx file in order to certify the site.But in our website we are using links to two sites managed by third party which is not HTTPS.If this is the case and if i do certification in our website will it be effective.As a trial  i have implemented pfx file in IIS, when the client machine accessed site first it will prompt with usual dialogue, and after forcefully moving in to the site, if you install it in local store, and if you clik show all content on the bottom of the IE, we can see all the data with HTTPS link.But no padlock in the left side of the browser, why i am not getting the padlock if you dont have padlock and if the site is HTTPS doe that good is there any better implementation for this scenario.One more question is if we have an HTTPS site which contain HTTP  sites from third party deployed in different server, does that work properly with SSLp

It seems like somehow by toggling codedisplay nonecode and then back to normal it messes up with their initial opacity state and sets it to 0, but it says its set to 0.4 still in the inspector.p  pThe weird part is, when I removed the break in the html and tried it again, a different two icons were visible two next to each other whereas normally its the two that are opposite each other vertically.p  pAnybody have any idea how to fix this other than to remove the opacity Thanksp  pEDIT Ive made the discovery that it has to do with toggling the size of the sidebar rather than the display type. When I toggle the sidebar, it goes from fullscreen to 80px and back again mobile. I just changed it to 60px and upon toggling back none of the icons were visible. I believe that if the size of the container gets smaller than their position then their opacity messes up. No idea why, I tried changing the .hidden class to codevisibility hiddencode rather than codedisplay nonecode but there was no change.p  pEDIT 2 Okay, so Ive debugged the issue down to the transition effect Im using for changing the sidebars size. Because Im changing the display on click, the elements are being created again before the container is large enough transition takes 0.3 seconds. This for some reason means they are not being rendered. Anyone know any fixes that could help thisp

Negative 60483 pstrongHere is the problem I am trying to solve. I have had no success solving it. Please help me Any help is appreciated Thanksstrong  p  pConsider the word search problem. The input to this problem consists of three integers m, n, and w, an m  n matrix of letters, and a list of w words. All of the words in the list are hidden inside the matrix of letters forwards, backwards, up, or down, but not diagonally, and the solution to a word search consists of w  2 array containing the row and column of the first letter of each word in the list, where the coordinates appear in the same order as the words. If one of the words in the list does not appear in the matrix of letters, this row of the output may contain any values. If it appears more than once, you may return any of its locations. Design an algorithm to solve the word search problem. Take care not to read past the top, bottom, left, or right of the letter matrix. Hint you may wish to use subarray notation, like letters [a..b, c], to denote words formed by scanning the matrix letters vertically or horizontally.p

Negative 60483 pI have several x,y plots that contain overlapping data, and my goal is to stitch them together into one single Master plot.  The plots are sequential, meaning that the first plot starts at point zero, and successive plots contain overlapping data from the previous plot in addition to new data. p  pI am hoping to do something similar to Image Registration, where various peaks and valleys within the overlapping areas in the data are used as landmarks. And that these landmarks are then used to stitch together plots into 1 single Master plot.p  pThe main issue I have is that the amplitude between successive plots are not the same. So the overlap in the Y aspect of the data is consistent in a relative sense, but not in an absolute sense. p  pHere is a sample of my datap  precodePlot 1 X1lt130 Y1ltc5,6,7,8,15,16,18,20,25,23,20,17,15,10,10,9,8,9,11,10,13,16,17,19,20,25,28,30,29,30  Plot 2 X2lt130 Y2ltc15,16,18,20,25,23,20,16,15,10,10,9,8,9,11,10,13,16,17,19,20,25,28,30,29,30,32,35,38,37  Plot 3 X3lt130 Y3ltc28,25,23,18,18,17,16,17,19,18,21,23,25,27,26,33,36,37,37,38,40,43,46,45,43,42,40,38,32,30  Plot 4 X4lt1325 Y4ltc27,30,29,36,39,39,40,41,43,46,49,48,46,45,43,41,35,33,30,29,28,30,31,32,35 codepre  pBelow is a plot I put together to demonstrate how the above data are related.

The first two plots line up well, but the 3rd plot is approximately 8 points off, and the 4th plot is approximately 11 points off.

As you can see it, it make a good result with instance.method style. I thought its style should be field.method. That is my second questionI have some kind of cofusion with 2nd question though.p  pEDIT 3p  pI just made my questions with wondering feelings. I do not want to make any kind of bizarre route to accomplish something. I just wondering how it works nicely even without any FIELD. It is so inconsistent with other types ways of normal working.
