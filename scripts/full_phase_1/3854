Positive 3854 pI have to write the server side of an Android application. I dont know much actually, anything about Android development. If an application has the login via Facebook icon, what happens emexactlyem on the serverp  pI assume the app, after authentication, would contact the app server and tell it I am Facebook user ID XXXXXX but whats stopping the app from saying so Wont the server need to hear that the application is authenticated emdirectlyemp  pThe normal way, with a Facebook login button on a web form, its more natural as the app redirects to Facebook, and then Facebook redirects back to the application once login is successful or not. But... what happens with a stand alone application, effectivelyp  pPlease note that I am after the emserverem side of things.p

Positive 3854 pIm stumbling upon an issue on changing the locale during the login event on a symfony 2.7 application. I was following the sticky locale symfony article a hrefhttpsymfony.comdoccurrentcookbooksessionlocalestickysession.html relnofollowhttpsymfony.comdoccurrentcookbooksessionlocalestickysession.htmla, but not using the session at all.p  pIm using the approach that every URI contains one representation only. Therefore all routes contain the locale and no need of a session variable for sticky locales.p  pIm just using the UserLocaleListener part to get the users locale and tried to set it into the route like on this github issue a hrefhttpsgithub.comFriendsOfSymfonyFOSUserBundleissues829 relnofollowhttpsgithub.comFriendsOfSymfonyFOSUserBundleissues829a.p  pMy problem possibly is, that on login is already a URI locale set. During the login event, I needwant to overwrite this locale value.

I am using Mint 17 Cinnamon with the MDM login and HTML welcome screen.p  pThe login control panel in Cinnamon says n will display hostname...p  pFor shizzngiggles, I entered a big random string of s in the Cinnamon control panel... A bunch of them returned data, but Im also assuming some didnt, as the HTML formatting simply displayed a layered jumbled mess within the welcom div tag. I scoured the internet and couldnt find a clear answer or concise list. I also looked here, but there are over a thousand posts about control characters, but none of them specific to MDM login.p  pI have noticed in other posts that there is sometimes a way to print out what control characters can be used within certain programsshells also...p  pSo I guess the final question isp  pWhat is the list of control characters that MDM login recognizes, and can I execute a command to display themprint them to a file for referencep  pThank you in advancep

Positive 3854 pI have an ASP 5 application using the security that comes with ASP.NET that uses Microsoft.AspNet.Identity and Owin along with System.Web.Security.  I have a serious login issue that will prevent my website going public  successful logins do not work sometimes.  Last summer the website was used privately by my agility club where the login problems became showed up.p  pWhen the problem happens, a user that logs in successfully is redirected to another web page and in the code on the next page of a successful login in the PageLoad, HttpContext.Current.User.Identity.IsAuthenticated is false instead of the usual and expected true which causes what looks like a login doing nothing because it returns.  I have 2 login pages for different scenarios where one page works better then the other one, although the code is the same except for some logic determining the next page having nothing to do with logging in. The better group login page goes to the same page as a less working page.

Positive 3854 pIve just migrated a site across to a new account on CPanel and I just cant access the databases at all.

Positive 3854 pSo, Im using a simple loginscript for a few pages, using sessions to identify the user, by putting the users name in a SESSION variable and then checking if the variable is set on each page. This worked fine when I ran the script locally through a WAMPserver  but when I uploaded it to a webhotel I ran into a weird issue.p  pThe loginscript, which sets the SESSION variable if the username and password matches up with information from a MySQLdatabase, somehow wont start the session. I have sessionstart at the top of every page, including the loginscript, so I dont understand why it wont start.p  pNow, I found a script on here that is used to check for sessionsupportp  precode     ltphp        Start Session       sessionstart        Show banner       echo ltbgtSession Support Checkerltbgtlthr gt        Check if the page has been reloaded      ifissetGET[reload] OR GET[reload]  true            Set the message          SESSION[MESSAGE]  Session support enabledltbr gt          Give user link to check         echo lta hrefreloadtruegtClick HEREltagt to check for PHP Session Support.ltbr gt                 else             Check if the message has been carried on in the reload            ifissetSESSION[MESSAGE]              echo SESSION[MESSAGE]                        else               echo Sorry, it appears session support is not enabled, or you PHP version is to old. lta hrefreloadfalsegtClick HEREltagt to go back.ltbr gt                         gt codepre  pThe really weird thing is that this script tells me that sessionsupport is enabled  and after running it, it suddenly works across all the pages. So I have to run this script in its own file every time I access the site, because the loginscript wont set the SESSION variable without running this script first.p  pJUST TO MAKE SURE I am NOT asking how to check if sessionsupport is enabled or not the issue is why sessions are not enabled untill AFTER I run the script above.p  pWhy is this happening, and how do I fix itp

Negative 3854 pI am writing an asp.net app that stored an object in cache.

Negative 3854 pI have a very big problem and cant seem to find anybody else on the internet that has my problem. I sure hope StackOverflow can help me...p  pI am writing an ASP.NET MVC application and Im using the Repository concept with Linq To Sql as my data store. Everything is working great in regards to selecting rows from views. And trapping very basic business rule constraints. However, Im faced with a problem in my stored procedure mappings for deletes, inserts, and updates. Let me explainp  pOur DBA has put a lot of work into putting the business logic into all of our stored procedures so that I dont have to worry about it on my end. Sure, I do basic validation, but he manages data integrity and conflicting date constraints, etc... The problem that Im faced with is that all of the stored procedures and I mean all have 5 additional parameters 6 for inserts that provide information back to me. The idea is that when something breaks, I can prompt the user with the appropriate information from our database. p  pFor examplep  precodespAddCategory     userID INT,     categoryName NVARCHAR100,     isActive BIT,     errNumber INT OUTPUT,     errMessage NVARCHAR1000 OUTPUT,     errDetailLogID INT OUTPUT,     sqlErrNumber INT OUTPUT,     sqlErrMessage NVARCHAR1000 OUTPUT,     newRowID INT OUTPUT codepre  pFrom the above stored procedure, the first 3 parameters are the only parameters that are used to Create the Category record. The remaining parameters are simply used to tell me what happened inside the method. If a business rule is broken inside the stored procedure, he does NOT use the SQL RAISEERROR keyword when business rules are broken. Instead, he provides information about the error back to me using the OUTPUT parameters. He does this for every single stored procedure in our database even the Updates and Deletes. All of the Get calls are done using custom views. They have all been tested and the idea was to make my job easier since I dont have to add the business logic to trap all of the various scenarios to ensure data quality.p  pAs I said, Im using Linq To Sql, and Im now faced with a problem. The problem is that my Category model object simply has 4 properties on it CategoryID, CategoryName, UserId, and IsActive. When I opened up the designer to started mapping my properties for the insert, I realized that there is really no easy way for me to account for the additional parameters unless I add them to my Model object.p  pTheoretically what I would LIKE to do is thisp  precode note Repository Methods public void AddCategoryCategory category      dbContext.Categories.InsertOnSubmitcategory   public void Save      dbContext.SubmitChanges  codepre  pAnd then from my CategoryController class I would simply do the followingp  precode[AcceptVerbsHttpVerbs.Post] public ActionResult CreateFormCollection collection      var category  new Category     try               UpdateModelcategory  simple validation here...          repository.AddCategorycategory         repository.Save  should get error here          return RedirectToActionIndex          catch               manage friendly messages here somehow...           ...          return Viewcategory       codepre  pWhat is the best way to manage this using Linq to Sql I personally dont feel that it makes sense to have all of these additional properties added to each model object... For example, the Get should NEVER have errors and I dont want my repository methods to return one type of object for Get calls, but accept another type of object for CUD calls.p  h1Update My Solution Dec. 1, 2009h1  pHere is what I did to fix my problem. I got rid of my Save method on all of my repositories. Instead, I added an Update method to each repository and actually commit the data to the database on each CUD ie. Create  Update  Delete call. p  pI knew that each stored procedure had the same parameters, so I created a class to hold themp  precodepublic class MySprocArgs       private readonly string methodName     public int Number     public string Message     public int ErrorLogId     public int SqlErrorNumber     public string SqlErrorMessage     public int NewRowId      public MySprocArgsstring methodName              if string.IsNullOrEmptymethodName             throw new ArgumentNullExceptionmethodName          methodName  methodName           public string MethodName              get  return methodName         codepre  pI also created a MySprocException that accepts the MySprocArgs in its constructorp  precodepublic class MySprocException  ApplicationException       private readonly MySprocArgs args     public MySprocExceptionMySprocArgs args  baseargs.Message             args  args           public int ErrorNumber              get  return args.Number            public string ErrorMessage              get  return args.Message            public int ErrorLogId              get  return args.ErrorLogId            public int SqlErrorNumber              get  return args.SqlErrorNumber            public string SqlErrorMessage              get  return args.SqlErrorMessage        codepre  pNow here is where it all comes together... Using the example that I started with in my initial inquiry, here is what the AddCategory method might look likep  precodepublic void AddCategoryCategory category     var args  new MySprocArgsAddCategory    var result  dbContext.AddWidgetSproc                     category.CreatedByUserId,                     category.Name,                     category.IsActive,                     ref args.Number,  lt Notice use of args                     ref args.Message,                     ref args.ErrorLogId,                     ref args.SqlErrorNumber,                     ref args.SqlErrorMessage,                     ref args.NewRowId     if result  1       throw new MySprocExceptionargs  codepre  pNow from my controller, I simply do the followingp  precode[HandleErrorExceptionType  typeofMySprocException, View  SprocError] public class MyController  Controller      [AcceptVerbsHttpVerbs.Post]     public ActionResult CreateCategory category              if ModelState.IsValid                        manage friendly messages                     return Viewcategory                   repository.AddCategorycategory         return RedirectToActionIndex         codepre  pThe trick to managing the new codeMySprocExceptioncode is to simply trap it using the HandleError attribute and redirect the user to a page that understands the MySprocException. p  pI hope this helps somebody. p

Negative 3854 pFor a specialized purpose with Aweber regarding a newsletter subscription, I have a page loading a nested IFRAME inside, and both reside on the same domain. Many other stackoverflow posts talk about different domains, but this question deals only with the same domain. I need a crossplatform way including browsers as old as the dawn of IE6 for the two to communicate.p  pFor example, someone fills out name and email and clicks a checkbox, and the hidden IFRAME next to the checkbox sits in a setInterval loop watching for that. When it receives notification, it grabs the name and email and does a form post.p  pI thought at first that I could just drop a cookie in the parent page, and then the IFRAME child could then sit in an interval watching for that cookie. But my tests show that this wont work. The cookie gets created  but the IFRAME cant see it. So, I tried the metarefresh technique in the IFRAME, and again it couldnt see that cookie for some reason.p  pThe only solution I can come up with is that the parent page will take the checkbox click we use jQuery and do an AJAX data push to the server into a database. The IFRAME can then check on an interval back to the server via AJAX to see if the database value has changed, and react to it if so. But this seems like an overengineered solution and Im looking for an easier alternative that works crossplatform, even in earlier browsers from the timeframe of IE6 and forward.p

Negative 3854 pWe have some applications up and running. We have implemented an Access Control List ACL in order to control, which users can do what guests included. And here is the troublep  pWhenever we disallow a guest to see something, the usual procedure for our software is to set a .htaccess and copy userspasswords from the ACL to the .htaccess.htpasswd. It worked like that for many years and offered a good protection against unauthorized access.p  pOf course, with todays standards set by Facebook and co., the idea of a passwordproteced folder via .htaccess has died down and our clientsusers are very annoyed by the constant passwordnagging. To adress that issue, I have thought of something but I dont know if it would work in the real world. Thats why I ask you guys.p  pWhat I want to do is, use an .htaccess to disallow all access from unknown domains. The only domain that has direct access to the files come from our own domain. With that rule, I can block any access from outside. Now, we updaterewrite certain parts of the software to control file access by itself instead of relying on a .htaccess that was set by another procedure.p  pMy idea is that, if only our own or the clientusers domain is allowed to access the file ergo. our software we can protect content from guests andor other users without relying on .htaccesspasswords.p  pWhat are your thoughts about thisp

Negative 3854 pIm an experienced programmer, but relatively new to SQL.  Were using Oracle 10 and 11.  I have a system in place using SQL that combines actual rows with virtual rows e.g. SELECT 1 from DUAL doing unions and intersects as needed, which all seems to work.p  pMy problem is that I need to combine this system which is expecting rows of data, with new data that will have the data in lets say for simplification comma delimited strings.p  pSo I think what I need is a way to convert a string like 5,6,7,8 into 4 rows with one column each, with 5 in the first row, 6 in the second, etc.  In other languages, Id do a Split with comma as the delimiter.  Of course, the data wont always have 4 entries.p  pTheres a second question, but Ill ask it separately.  But I suspect it will simplify things, if possible, if the solution to the above could be used as a table in another SQL statement i.e., to work with my existing system.  Thanks for any help.p

This observale Collection is bound to grid control in WPF application where user can add remove books. We need to persist all added, removed and modified records in collection till user hit the save to database. Our contraint is book name and IBN number of book must be unique. If user add new book with duplicate book name that already present in collection then we need to invalidate that object, so that it will not allow user to save in database till all collection object are not valid. I know it can be achieved with different ways, I want to know about best practices to do this. Any solution with IDataErrorInfo or Enterprise Validation Library is appreciated.p

Does anyone know whether you can set the type of the returned object in a similar way.

Negative 3854 pI am working on a robot, its part of the summer robotics workshop in our college. We are using CSTAMP micro controllers by AWIT. I was able to make it move, turn left, turn right, move backward. I have even managed to make it go along the black tape using a contrast sensor. p  pI send the robot at 3045 degrees toward the black tape on the table and it aligns itself and starts to move along the black tape. It jerks a little, probably due to my programming logic below, its running a whileloop and constantly checking ifstatements, so it ends up trying to turn left and right every few milliseconds, which explains the jerking part. But its okay, it works, not as smooth as I want it to work but it works Problem is that I cant make my robot go into a rectangular path of the black tape. As soon as it reaches the corner of the black tape it just keeps going straight instead of making left or right turn. p  pMy 2 sensors are located right underneath the robot, next to the front wheel, almost at the floor level. It has index value ranging from 0 to 8. Eight being the brightest contrast and zero being the darkest contrast. So when the robot moves into the blacktapezone, the index value drops, and based on that, I have an ifstatement telling my robot to either turn left or right.p  pemHeres my attempt. To avoid confusion I didnt post the entire source code, but only the logical part responsible for the movement of my robot along the black tape.emp  precodewhile1        dont worry about these.      10 and 9 represent Sensors PIN location on the motherboard     V  ANALOGIN10, 1, 0, 0, 0     V2  ANALOGIN9, 1, 0, 0, 0       i got this formula from the example in my Manual.

The whole concept is to use the data the a user inserts to the text boxes and they are sent after clicking a OK button directly to a powerpoint file. Im using OFFICE 2007 so Im using powerpoint 2007 for this. A similar concept that Im already using in the website project is doing the same thing but exporting to a WORD format file. I bumped against this following site a software to perform this and its called SoftArtisans. There website is a hrefhttpwww.softartisans.com relnofollowhttpwww.softartisans.coma . Now, if somebody has a clue or a tutorial how I can do this, Export to a powerpoint file Ill be very thankful.   I am also using Microsoft SQL Server 2008 R2 to save the data in the database, so if maybe someone knows how to export the data from the textboxes from the website TO the database and then TO the powerpoint file that could help to.p  pThank you very much for your help and support.p

Negative 3854 pI would like to learn what kind of real time activityproblem tracking methods people use. Let me clarify what I meanp  pWhen programming, I usually take a note for the current problem that I try to solve. I write down a sentence to name the problem. During research or debugging, I come across several alternative solution ideas that might solve the original problem. I choose one alternative and dive into implementing the solution. Usually, the solution is not an easy, one step solution. During implementation, I encounter new problems. To overcome these new problems, I need to make new research or debugging. p  pFrequently, after some while, I find myself totally lost and frustrated. I may have spent lots of hours for a specific alternative solution which proves to be a false method but I may have forgotten several other alternatives which might be actually much easier to implement. p  pIs there any name for this kind of activity tracking problem I think activity tracking concept is usually used for time tracking purposes. I dont care about time really. For me, the conceptual or logical relationships in the cycles between problems and solution steps are much more important.p  pI am asking this question because I think if I know the name of this concept it will be much easier to find a good methodological solution for it.p

Negative 3854 pIm writing a proxy script that ideally does the following thingsp  ol liProxy waits for request for certain protected pages from end userli liPosts login information to page.  The login information is hidden to the end user.li liProxy reads the setcookie response from the server and hands off this cookie to the end user.  At this point the end user is finished interacting with the proxy.li ol  pIve decided to take this approach because I found it very difficult to proxify certain types of pages like those with lots of javascript code.  I thought that this logical flow would be sufficient because my only requirement is to hide the login information from the enduser and my manager says that handing off the cookie is fine.p  pMy problem is that I cannot think of how to hand off the cookie to the end user.  First, the cookie is generated for my proxy server, not the user.  Does this matter  It seems that I get all the setcookie responses, but when I make another request those cookies disappear.p  pCan anyone point me in the right direction, or point out any inconsistencies in my thinkingp  pThanksp

Negative 3854 pI have a producer object, that steps through some data and emits various signals depending on what data item is next in the queue.p  pEach of those signals are processed by at most one consumer object at a time it takes care to disconnect its slots before attaching the producers signals to the other consumer.p  pIf the processing on the consumer side fails for whatever reason, the processing of the queue must stop, as there is no point in going ahead with it.p  pWhat would be the optimal way of letting the producer know, that no further processing is needed because of an exceptional condition Since the consumers have a pointer to the producer, I would imagine, that there could be multiple ways, its just that I am not sure if they are raceconditionsafe I dont know if I can depend on the order in which signals are emitted  processed.p  pTwo ways I can think ofp  ul liset a flag on the producer, that can be checked on the next iteration so that it will know that it is time to stopli liregister a signal on the consumer and a corresponding slot on the producer, that will be emitted when processing should be haltedli ul  pI am wondering if these solutions are viable at all in the following scenariosp  ul liproducer and consumers belong to the same threadli liproducer and consumers belong to different threadsli ul  pIn short, I have to make absolutely sure, that no additional processing will happen if the consumer reports an error.p  pAs you can probably guess, I am not very familiar with Qts idioms for such things yet.p

However, this is clearly not a scalable solution as it forces each developer to understand all the dependencies of the code they are working with so they can figure out the dependencies emby handem rather than by using the codemakecode utility.p  pAnother solution would be to have a different variable for each object file that listed all its downstream dependencies i.e code1  executable.o executabledependenciescode. This is not a desired solution because it forces the makefile to be compiled in the specific way so the variables are only used when they are fully defined. Also, for really large applications these variables might exceed the maximum variable length.p  pYet another solution is to use archive .a files for linking. In this case, we could construct an codeinnerclass1.acode that included both codeinnerdefintions.ocode and codeinnerclass1.ocode, so it could be linked with any object file that needed codeinnerclass1.ocode without forcing the developer to reconstruct the dependencies. This approach seems promising, but involves having many duplicate files. Also, it doesnt appear that the codegcccode linker can handle nested archive files.p  pIs there another approach What is the best approach Can the codegcccode linker handle nested archive filesp

Negative 3854 pIve already looked for the answer for this question, and Ive found the following suggestionsp  ol liIf you are always expecting to find a value then throw the exception if it is missing. The exception would mean that there was a problem. If the value can be missing or present and both are valid for the application logic then return a null.li liOnly throw an exception if it is truly an error. If it is expected behavior for the object to not exist, return the null.li ol  pBut how should I interpret them in my so casual case My web app controller is receiving request to show details for a user with a certain id. Controller asks the service layer to get the user, and then the service returns the object, if its found. If not, a redirect to default location is issued.p  pWhat should I do when someone passes invalid user id inside the request URL Should I consider it as expected behaviour and return null to the controller, or perhaps should I call it a problem or unexpected behaviour and thus throw an exception inside the service method and catch in inside the controllerp  pTechnically its not a big difference after all, but Id like to do it the right way by following standard convetions. Thanks in advance for any suggestions.p  pEDIT I assume, that the URLs generated by the app are valid and existing  when clicked by user, the user with a certaing id should be found. I want to know how to handle a situation, when user tries to access URL with wrong not existing user id, by manually typing the URL into browsers address bar.p

Negative 3854 pIm trying to implement an Android application to receive data from a medical device but strongI cant get through the discovery process and get the phone and the device paired or connected to each other.strongp  pstrongDescribing the medical devicestrong  The device is using Service Discovery Protocol SDP and Serial Port Profile SPP. It starts an inquiry procedure to discover up to 10 surrounding access points with matched COD Filter and Service Name. Then it sequentially establishes a connection using Page Procedure with the access point by checking the PIN. Once the PIN is matched, the data is uploaded. Upon uploading data the device waits for an acknowledge. The decice is the master and initiates the communication.p  pI have no control of the medical device.

Negative 3854 pNumerous people have asked a similar question, but the responses were either just vague enough or not in the direction I needed things to go, so I will attempt to ask this as concretely as possible.  The context of this question is for iOS development using XCode 4.p  pI have an app where I use the same Widget numerous times.  In this simple exercise the widget will be a fixed sized red box with a label at the top that the root view controller will change, but you can imagine it has lots of ImageViews and ScrollViews and looks pretty spiffy.  This last point is key, because noncoding artistic designers want to be able to tweak this view globally without having to do the same thing over and over on each duplicated piece of the UI.  p  pIn the app I have replaced the ImageViews and ScrollViews that used to make up the widget with a single UIView, and using InterfaceBuilder set the Custom Class to codeWidgetcode.  I have outlets in the root view controller for these Widget objects properly hooked up.  The Widget Class is a subclass of UIView, and the code is as followsp  precodeinterface Widget  UIView      UILabel     label   property nonatomic, retain IBOutlet  UILabel label property nonatomic, copy NSString labelName end   implementation Widget synthesize label, labelName   idinitWithCoderNSCoder aDecoder      if self  [super initWithCoderaDecoder]            This is the code that I want to disappear             CGRect pos  CGRectMake5, 5, 90, 30         label  [[UILabel alloc] initWithFramepos]         [self addSubviewlabel]         self.backgroundColor  [UIColor redColor]          return self    NSString labelName      return label.text    This live updates the label in this custom view  voidsetLabelNameNSString name      label.text  name    voiddealloc      [super dealloc]  end codepre  pThe code works great, and I can live update the text in the custom views from the main view controller.  However, the four lines of code that are in initWithCoder are the problem.  Remember the designers  I have them at the point where they can work their magic with Interface Builder, but I cant for the life of me figure out how to get the UIView to load itself from a nib that they have designed.  To manually try and replicate the positioning and properties of ever single item is not terribly exciting and pretty timeconsuming and yes I realize I would be done by now if I hadnt written this posting.p  pSo very simply, how can I take an arbitrary .xib file and have it do the work I handrolled in initWithCoder  I am assuming it will be trivial at that point to hook up the IBOutlet for the UILabel, but please comment on this if Im overly optimistic.p  pAs a secondary question, once that is up and running on the real UI, I will have things like, UIScrollViews hooked up.  Does Widget become the UIScrollViewDelegate or where does this code get parked.  The root view controller should be oblivious to this, but it feels inappropriate to put code I traditionally put in a View Controller into a UIView object.p

Negative 3854 pRecently I had problems with my email account gmx.net. I have about 30 failed login attempts a day. But that is not the topic of the question I already changed my password.p  pIt got me thinking. Is this in automatic attack And if so, how is it done I took a look at the HTML code of the page and found out, that it is pretty easy to just copy the source code of the form element and do a login attempt through a local html file copy and paste, new HTML file, open in browser, enter your credentials, submit. That means it is an easy task to automate such things write a little script, that does a post with various values  Brute Force attack. I was about to write an email to the mail hosted, when I found out, that the exact same process can be done on facebook.com....p  pI had the impression, that since we have all these new fancy web frameworks like Rails, Django and so on, we have an automatic protection against such attacks for example the protect from forgery which Rails includes a hrefhttpruby.about.comodsecurityaforgeryprotect.htm relnofollowhttpruby.about.comodsecurityaforgeryprotect.htmap  pMy question here isp  pIs there any sane reason to allow a login attempt from another server p  pDont give me API, the most APIs for web application require a manual login process before authorization.p  pI know there are many more ways to brute force attack any website login use a framework that controls a browser etc... and there are many ways to protect IPbanning etc. But shouldnt disabling a remote login be one of the first security mechanisms you would takep

Negative 3854 pC newbie here so please forgive me if my terminology isnt quite correct.p  pAs part of this project, I have a user hold up a piece of paper to a webcam so I can capture, isolate and then eventually display back what theyve drawn on it. Ive put some restrictions on where the corners of the paper have to be in order for the program to accept it, but theres still the chance that its distorted by perspective. p  pHeres an example image that Ive captured and isolated the paper out of a hrefhttpi.imgur.comeFwuY.jpg relnofollowimageap  pWhat I want to be able to do is to distort this image so that the corners of the piece of paper are turned back into a 8.5x11proportioned rectangle as if the user had scanned it rather than held it up to the webcam. Rotation and skewing can only get me so far, ideally I would be able to freely transform the image, like in Photoshop. I found a hrefhttpwww.vcskicks.comimagedistortion.php relnofollowthis examplea, I am basically trying to do the opposite.

It has two dependency properties, liquidLevel and liquidCapacity, and I want to pass both of these parameters into a converter along with a gradientBrush.

It seems more manageable to me to be able to hardcode the liquidcapacity in the xaml, and bind the liquidlevel to the viewmodel. The view model will being pulling a bunch of values out of a database and into an observable dictionary, one of those being the liquidlevel, so it would be much easier I think to bind liquidlevel directly to the observable dictionary, rather than try and convert it to a fillpercentage in the view model before binding it.    p  pPlus im pretty stubborn and in the interest of my education does anyone know if what I proposed to do is possible. If so, what the correct way to go about it  p

Negative 3854 pFirst time poster here . Im having the following trouble automating Excel 2010 from a WinForms C application.

After that I run the following codep  precode        Excel.Range range  xlSheet.UsedRange         range.AutoFilter1, AAA, Excel.XlAutoFilterOperator.xlAnd, Type.Missing, true         Excel.Range filteredRange  range.SpecialCellsExcel.XlCellType.xlCellTypeVisible codepre  pThis works as expected, and filterRange now contains the first four rows of my test table the column names and all the AAA rows. If, however, I try to use AutoFilter to get all the BBB rows, like thisp  precode        range.AutoFilter1, BBB, Excel.XlAutoFilterOperator.xlAnd, Type.Missing, true         Excel.Range filteredRange  range.SpecialCellsExcel.XlCellType.xlCellTypeVisible codepre  pI end up with only the firs row of the table column names in the filteredRange Range. If I actually open the table in Excel I can see that it is correctly filtered the BBB rows are filtered, but somehow the Range.SpecialCells method does not behave as expected and only returns the first row.  Ive tried everything I can think of, but since Im new to Excel automation, maybe Im missing something, so I thought you guys might be able to help. The only thing that comes to my mind is that in the first case AAA, all visible rows are consecutive  the column names are on row 1 and the AAA rows are 2, 3, and 4 respectively. In the second case, the names are on row 1 but the BBB rows are with index 5, 6 and 7, i.e. there is an hole in the table. Could this perhaps affect the SpecialCells methodp  pThanks in advance for any input you might havep

Indeed as the list in question can be created in any SPWeb by activating the feature it doesnt exist at compile time so is unknown to the data context.p  pOn MSDN it is explained that to handle lists of more than one content type SPMetal generates the data context to use the nearest base content type for a list of this nature. See the Generating entities for content types section here a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibraryff798478.aspx relnofollowhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibraryff798478.aspxap  pBased on this I access the list using the base content type. For example assuming the following content type hierarchyp  precodeItem   Foo  Item     BlueFoo  Foo     RedFoo  Foo       BrightRedFoo  RedFoo       DarkRedFoo  RedFoo     GreenFoo  Foo codepre  pThen my list can contain items of any of the XXXFoo content types and to access it  the data context uses an codeEntityListltFoogtcode.p  pThis works perfectly for reading items from the list albeit they are all of type Foo rather than their derived types though this is no real problem as using some jiggery involve a ICustomMapping extension to Item to access the hidden content type field the generated repository layer can access the underlying SPListItem and down cast to the derived type too if required.p  pThe issue arises when I try to write an item to the list. First I tried to create a specific EntityList for this purpose e.g. codeEntityListltRedFoogtcode but this caused an exception. So then I added the Foo type to the Lists content types too and tried to add an item using an codeEntityListltFoogtcode but this causes the same exception.p  pThe exception is the same in both instances and the error message is Columns associated with mappings have been deletedrenamed. A Google search for this finds just the one happy fellow who encountered this message, omourad.blogspot.com201006columnsassociatedwithmappingshave.html, but his issue was incorrectly naming his list. This is not my problem.p  pAfter a couple of hours trawling the WWW I am finding very little discussion on SPLists with multiple content type and practically nothing relating to Linq and this issue. There is this on CodePlex a hrefhttpsporm.codeplex.com relnofollowhttpsporm.codeplex.coma but it has 0 downloads and has been quiet since 2009... p  pI have tried accessing directly from the data context rather than using the repository layer to make sure the problem isnt in my code. Ive regenerated the data context from a web with the feature activated so that I can be certain its not out of sync.p  pAm I missing something Is this fixed by a cumulative update I have somehow missed Surely I am not the only person who has tried to do this I feel almost as lonely as when you have a problem and the only online reference you can find is a StackOverflow tumbleweed question. There must be someone out there who can stop this being a tumbleweed question of its ownp
Negative 3854 pI am trying to compose a Vim script function to help format where the left braces are located at in C like functions blocks.p  precodefunction FixLeftBraces     Set the cursor to the top of the file     call cursor1,0     while search.,We gt 0         exe normal ine     endwhile endfunction codepre  pIn this example my goal is to locate the left curly bracket that is on the same line as the function and relocate it to the next line.

Negative 3854 pI created a partial view in an MVC 3 application.

If I use this partial view as an editor template, it works.  Any help is appreciated.p  pEdit To be more specific I have an HTML form and I want to add markup to it via ajax update if th e user clicks on a button, I want to add new markup to that form. If I include those controls statically, I mean if I render them when the page gets loaded, validation works but if I add controls to that form by an ajax call, no validation markup is inserted for those controls. My partial view looks like thisp  precodeHtml.LabelForx gt x.ProductPrice  Html.TextBoxForx gt x.ProductPrice  Html.ValidationMessageForx gt x.ProductPrice codepre  pMy form looks like thisp  precodeusing Html.BeginForm      ltdiv iddivProductsgt         Html.EditorForx gt x     ltdivgt      ltinput typesubmit valueCompare gt  codepre  pThe code above works well, validation works. On server side I invoke an action method that looks likep  precode[HttpPost] public ActionResult InsertProduct      var newProductVM  new ProductViewModel ProductPrice  789       return PartialViewViewsNutritionEditorTemplatesProductViewModel.cshtml, newProductVM  codepre  pI figured out that the MVC engine inserts those validation markup only if it finds that the controls are inside a form control. When I try to update my form control via an ajax call, MVC has no way to know that they will be placed inside a form element and thats why it doesnt emit any validation logic for them, I suppose.p

Negative 3854 pIve written a few custom bindings using KnockoutJS. Im still unsure when to use codeko.util.unwrapObservableitemcode Looking at the code, that call basically checks to see if codeitemcode is an observable. If it is, return the value, if its not, just return the value. Looking at the section on Knockout about creating custom bindings, they have the following syntaxp  precodevar value  valueAccessor, allBindings  allBindingsAccessor var valueUnwrapped  ko.utils.unwrapObservablevalue codepre  pIn this case, they invoke the observable via codecode but then also call codeko.utils.unwrapObservablecode.

Negative 3854 pI am getting information from a database that I have no control over. The value of state is a user entered and properly cleaned value, but may be the written out state name or the two letter postal abbreviation. I can easily build an associative array of states and abbreviations. But I was wondering if there is a way, PHP, to determine if a value is in the array of statesabbrev as a strongkeystrong OR a strongvaluestrong. So, if you enter CA it sees it is a valid two letter strongkeystrong and returns it. If it sees XY is NOT a valid strongkeystrong then it retuns a default OTHER key ZZ, but if the user entered input is New York it will see it is a valid strongvaluestrong and return the associated key, NYp

Negative 3854 pIm trying to figure out how to use cascading against an archive of data whose schema is additive over time. Why I mean by additive is that it will start out with 3 columns, for example. Then in the next release it might have 5 columns. These columns follow standard CSV layouts. My understanding is that if I specify a schema to be 5 columns long and the old schema is only 3, then Cascading will fail.p  pIs there a way to tell cascading to fill in the missing columns Like a default  nullp

Negative 3854 pHere is a question for WCF hosing environmentp  blockquote   pYou are developing an application that performs file backups in the   background. The background application will host a Windows   Communication Foundation WCF service and must be active as soon as   the machine is running. The background application will not have a   user interface. A frontend application will consume the WCF service   and will provide the user interface.p      pYou need to choose a host environment for the WCF service. Which   hosting environment should you choosep      ul   liA. Microsoft Internet Information Services IIS 6.0li   liB. Windows Process Activation Services WASli   liC.

Negative 3854 pI encountered a problem which I need some help with  suppose I have some data set consisting of keys integers and values integers as well. I need to be able to, given some value of a key, find the minimal key range to which it belongs that is, find the closest greater and smaller keys and then return the matching value via interpolation. I was wondering which way would allow me to do this in the fastest time space complexity matters much less. also, deletion is irrelevant and all values are given at startup we may assume there will be no more values added after startup. My emphasis is on search time, rather than insertion.p  pThe most basic solution would be to keep a sorted array of keys and use binary search on it  until either I find the input key or find two adjacent elements which are greater and smaller than the input key. This option would take Olog n for insertion and searching. I was wondering if there is any better.p  pThanks p

Negative 3854 pThis is seemingly a bug, but im wondering if anyone can think of a workaround.p  pOn iPad, you present a view controller as a UIModalPresentationFormSheet. This view controller is extending UITabBarController and has enough controllers to automatically display the more tab bar button.  Once you tap on the more button it will display the list correctly, but as soon as you tap on edit it presents the edit view larger then the actual form sheet cropped inside the form sheet, causing the content to be out of view, including the toolbar with the done button.

Unless you want a good giggle at someones misfortune and gloat in your own awesomeness knowing that you would never leave behind such a monumental pile of crap for your successors.p  pSo, if youre sitting comfortably then Ill begin.p  pIn this app that I have inherited and been supporting and bug fixing for the last 7 months I have been left with a DOOZY of a balls up by a developer that left 6 and a half months ago. Yes, 2 weeks after I started.p  pAnyway. In this app we have codeclientscode, codeemployeescode and codevisitscode tables.p  pThere is also a table called codeAppNewRefcode or something similar that ... wait for it ... contains the next record ID to use for each of the other tables. So, may contain data such as p  precodeTypeID    Description     NextRef    1      Employees       804    2      Clients         1708    3      Visits          56783 codepre  pWhen the application creates new rows for codeEmployeescode, it looks in the codeAppNewRefcode table, gets the value, uses that value for the ID, and then updates the codeNextRefcode column. Same thing for codeClientscode, and codeVisitscode and all the other tables whose codeNextIDcode to use is stored in here. p  pYes, I know, no autonumbering codeIDENTITYcode columns on this database. All under the excuse of when it was an Access app. These IDs are held in the VB6 code as longs. So, up to 2 billion 147 million records possible. OK, that seems to work fairly well. apart from the fact that the app is updating and taking care of locking  updating, etc., and not the databasep  pSo, our users are quite happily creating codeEmployeescode, codeClientscode, codeVisitscode etc. The codeVisits IDcode is steady increasing a few dozen at a time. Then the problems happen. Our clients are causing database corruptions while creating batches of visits because the server is beavering away nicely, and the app becomes unresponsive. So they kill the app using task manager instead of being patient and waiting. Granted the app does seem to lock up.p  pRoll on to earlier this year and developer Tim real name. No protecting the guilty here starts to modify the code to do the batch updates in stages, so that the UI remains responsive. Then April comes along, and hes working his notice you can picture the scene now, cant you  and hes beavering away to finish the updates.p  pEnd of April, and beginning of May we update some of our clients. Over the next few months we update more and more of them.p  pUnseen by Tim real name, remember and me who started two weeks before Tim left and the other new developer that started a week after, the IDs in the visit table start to take huge leaps upwards. By huge, I mean 10000, 20000, 30000 at a time. Sometimes a few hundred thousand.p  pHeres a graph that illustrates the rapid increase in IDs used.p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.com90MBp.jpg altTake a look at his graphp  pRoll on November. Customer phones Tech Support and reports that hes getting an error. I look at the error message and ask for the database so I can debug the code. I find that the value is too large for a long. I do some queries, pull the information, drop it into Excel and graph it.p  pI dont think making the code handle anything longer than a long for the IDs is the right approach, as this app passes that ID into other DLLs and OCXs and breaking the interface on those just seems like a whole world of hurt that I dont want to encounter right now.p  pOne potential idea that Im investigating is try to modify the IDs so that I can get them down to a lower level. Essentially filling the gaps. Using the codeROWNUMBERcode functionp  pWhat Im thinking of doing is adding a new column to each of the tables that have a Foreign Key reference to these Visit IDs emnot a proper foreign key mind, those constraints dont exist in this database.em This new column could store the old current value of the Visit ID oh, just to confuse things on some tables its called codeEventIDcode, and on some its called codeVisitIDcode.p  pThen, for each of the other tables that refer to that codeVisitIDcode, update to the new value.p  pIdeas  Suggestions  Snippets of TSQL to help all gratefully received.p

Records that I manually enter through SSMS do not show in the DD List for the table, but rows I inserted thru the website do appear.  p  pI have cleared the table and refreshed the list view and all rows disappear.

I want to leverage this statement and hence would like to go for thread pool where more threads of type Thread B can be introduced and they parallely withdraw the data and send them to Thread C.p  pWhat I have done till nowp  p1 Nothing much, I am deciding on the right strategy.  2 I went through the following blog  a hrefhttpcodeidol.comjavajavaconcurrencyApplyingThreadPoolsSizingThreadPools relnofollowhttpcodeidol.comjavajavaconcurrencyApplyingThreadPoolsSizingThreadPoolsa 3 The formula described there wants me to compute NC, ratio of wait time to compute time. For the same I have decided to use Netbeans profiler remotely and analyze both the thread activity and the method level instrumentation. 4 However the same does not give me CPU usage, so I am planning to use Visual VMs monitor tab to analyze the CPU usage. 5 I am aware about the fact that scaling of threads will need require more cumulative stack memory. 6 The number of Database connections at anytime may not be a problem, but I have to check on the same.p  pAm I following the right path   Especially I need advice because there are multiple JVM processes, so I am getting more confused in terms of analysis p  pThanksp

Negative 3854 pThis is a question about vtk program. p  pIm making a rigid registration between 3D MRI and 3D US image. The size of US data is much bigger than MRI. First, I take some landmarks on the same organ of both images.Then, I use vtkLandmarkTransform to get a transform between these landmark points. At last I apply the transform to MRI data by using vtkImageReslice.

Negative 3854 pIs there a way to show the emcompleteem internal structure of an R object in an unambiguous and human readable wayp  pThe codestrcode function doesnt exactly do this, as it shows custom representations.  For example, applying it to an igraph object gives something likep  precodeIGRAPH U 3 3  Full graph  attr name gc, loops gx  edges [1] 12 13 23 codepre  pThis is nice and readable, but its specific to igraph objects its clear that it uses a custom formatting for them.  Im looking for something general.  I found codedputcode, and for a while I thought that this provides complete information.  The same igraph object is shown as p  precodestructurelist3, FALSE, c1, 2, 2, c0, 0, 1, c0, 1, 2,      c0, 1, 2, c0, 0, 1, 3, c0, 2, 3, 3, listc1, 0, 1,          structurelistname  Full graph, loops  FALSE, .Names  cname,          loops, list, list, class  igraph codepre  pBut then I read about pairlists in the R Language Definition and I noticed that  codedputpairlist1,2code gives codelist1,2code.  The information that we started with a pairlist is gone.p  pSo is there something similar to codedputcode that shows the internal structure of an R object and gives emcompleteem information about it  The main reason I want this is that it would help me understand the structure of R objects better.p  pIf there isnt, how would I query an R object to get enough information about it in a human readable waynot machine readable to be able to reconstruct it completelyp

Negative 3854 pIve had some experience in C from school works. Ive learned, among other things, that objects should be stored in a container vector, map, etc as pointers. The main reason being that we need the use of the newoperator, along with a copy constructor, in order to create a copy on the heap otherwise called dynamic memory of the object. This method also necessitates defining a destructor.p  pHowever, from what Ive read since then, it seems that STL containers already store the values they contain on the heap. Thus, if I were to store my objects as values, a copy using the copy constructor would be made on the heap anyway, and there would be no need to define a destructor. All in all, a copy on the heap would be made anywayp  pAlso, iftrue, then the only other reason I can think of for storing objects using pointers would be to alleviate resource needs for copying the container, as pointers are easier to copy than whole objects. However, this would require the use of stdsharedptr instead of regular pointers, since you dont want elements in the copied container to be deleted when the original container is destroyed. This method would also alleviate the need for defining a destructor, wouldnt itp  pstrongEdit strong The destructor to be defined would be for the class using the container, not for the class of the objects stored.p  pstrongEdit 2 strong I guess a more precise question would be  Does it make a difference to store objects as pointers using the newoperator, as opposed to plain values, on a memory and resources used standpointp

Negative 3854 pIm using codeteamcitycode to deploy our web application to several servers using codemsbuildcode and codewebdeploycode.  p  pI have a configuration per customer  environment combination  for examplep  precodeInternalDev Customer1Test Customer1Pilot Customer1Live Customer2Test Customer2Pilot Customer2Live codepre  pI only need these configurations so that the deployment process can use web.config transformations to set the appropriate connection strings and other settings for the installation.p  pThe problem that I have is that I have a shared web server controls project which really only needs two configurations  codedebugcode and codereleasecode  but I need to copy all the above configurations into this project in order to get them to work.  If I delete codeCustomer2Pilotcode from the shared project, I cant deploy to customer 2s pilot server because it is looking for the codeCustomer2Pilotcode configuration for the shared project which doesnt exist.p  pCurrently, I copy the applications configuration names into the shared project but that is impractical as we have several applications each going to different customers so the shared project could get dozens of configurations which are all copies of codeReleasecode or codeDebugcodep  pI would like to be able to configure the build system so that I can say that the codeInternalDevcode configuration of the web application project uses the shared projects codeDebugcode configuration and all the other configurations use the shared projects codeReleasecode configuration.  This is possible from within the IDE, using the configuration manager which can tie a solution configuration to individual project configurations but Im not sure how to do this from within codeteamcitycode.p  pMy current teamcity configuration is using the codeMSBuildcode runner with the web applications strongprojectstrong file as the build file path and the configuration parameters set to deploy it to the relevant server with the correct configuration after it has been built.  The shared project is in a subrepository of the web application repository so it is fetched and built automatically.p  pIs there any way that I can change this set up to get what I want  Do I need to change the build file path to be the solution instead of the project so that I can use the configuration manager settings to configure itp

Negative 3854 pI have a build area BuildArea checked in, which contains shared scripts and wrappers and whatnot that I use to build a project. This is rarely updated.p  pSeparately, I have various projects Proj1, Proj2, Proj3... under development which update regularly.p  pStandard flow is to checkout the latest source files from a project e.g. Proj1, and then build the project in my build area BuildArea. The next day theres an update to Proj1 and also a Proj2, which I also want to build in my build area. All these builds only read the files in BuildArea no modifications are made except to create a unique results directory.p  pSo, my questions are  1. Can I create a Jenkins job that maintains a build area BuildArea and updates daily for example.  2. Can I then kick off independent Jenkins jobs that run within that build area and dump their results therep  pThe main reason I want to do this is that there are many projects run during the week and the build area is enormous, so checking out a local build area for each project is a big waste of resource.p
Negative 3854 pI have searched a lot for the solution on this forum and many other places but cant find an elegant solution.

I am using twitter bootstrap here is the problem.p  precodeltdiv classrowgt ltdiv classcollg3gt Side Bar Content Here ltdivgt  ltdiv classcollg9gt Main Content of the page ltdivgt ltdivgt codepre  pI am using background color on side bar. Now the problem is setting the height of the sidebar equal to the height of the container so that the sidebar doesnt break in the middle. As the content in the right side can be anything from few words to few pages I cant set any fixed height to collg3. Height100 doesnt work due to bug in webkit. p  pI am looking for a javascript solution or something in jquery which will calculate height of container div row and set that height to collg3 so the background covers from top to bottom. This is the problem many people face and I have seen numerous questions without some very helpful answers. So this will halp a lot of people.p  pCheers Ahmarp

Negative 3854 pIn college the professor has asked us to devise an algorithm to implement the circular queue. We have to write algorithms for the remove and insert functions.

Thus on increasing front if front  rear means queue is empty. And on increasing rear if rear  front means queue is full.p  pBut when I showed this to my Professor he said that this is not the solution.p  pIs this logic incorrect If so, what is the flaw in this algorithm Also if possible please suggest improvements.p  pPS The reason I have not Googled for solutions is because I want to implement this myself. p

Negative 3854 pDirectly quoting from ehcaches website a hrefhttpehcache.orgdocumentationintegrationsgoogleappengine relnofollow[source]ap  blockquote   pThe idea here is that your caches are set up in a cache hierarchy.   Ehcache sits in front and memcacheg behind. Combining the two lets you   elegantly work around limitations imposed by Google App Engine. You   get the benefits of the speed of Ehcache together with the umlimited   size of memcached. Ehcache contains the hooks to easily do this. To   update memcached, use a CacheEventListener. To search against   memcacheg on a local cache miss, use cache.getWithLoader together   with a CacheLoader for memcacheg.p blockquote  pThis seems to imply that using ehcache with memcached would be faster than using memcached alone. Why would ehcache be faster than memcached The way I see it, both are in memory caches so why the performance differencep
Negative 3854 pI have a very simple app consisting of a single view. Everything works fine, the app rotates and buttons on the right side of the screen are clickable.

It seems to be exactly 768 pixels from the left where it stops working, so it makes me think theres something in the app that didnt rotate. What could be wrongp  pIts just a basic single view wizard app that I put some UI elements on it to test.

Negative 3854 pI have a very strange problem.p  pIm running a very busy LAMP web service on Ubuntu over a million visitors daily and lately Im having problems with apache responding slowly. p  pThe odd thing is that neither the webserver machine nor the database machine are reaching any sort of limits.

I checked the slow query log, process list, etc. and theres no sign of any slow queries or anything holding back the system. p  pThe only thing at the moment I can do to keep the system up to speed is disabling some database calls on a users visit.

Negative 3854 pSo I am using VBA in Access to create linked tables between Excel and Access.

Negative 3854 pI started to learn JavaScript recently. Ive been working in the creation of applications with a hrefhttpwww.nodejs.org relnofollowNode.jsa and a hrefhttpangularjs.org relnofollowAngulara for a few months now.p  pOne of the main aspects that was puzzling me was how it is possible to write asynchronous code in JavaScript in which I do not have to worry about things like a hrefhttpen.wikipedia.orgwikiSynchronization28computerscience29 relnofollowthread synchronizationa, a hrefhttpen.wikipedia.orgwikiRacecondition relnofollowrace conditionsa, etc.p  pSo, I found a couple of interesting articlesa hrefhttpwww.sitepoint.commultithreadingjavascript relnofollow[1]a,a hrefhttpblog.mixu.net20110201understandingthenodejseventloop relnofollow[2]a that explained how I can be guaranteed that any piece of code that I write will always be executed by a single thread at the time. Bottom line, all my asynchronous code is simply scheduled to be executed at some point within an a hrefhttpen.wikipedia.orgwikiEventloop relnofollowevent loopa. This sounds pretty much like the OS scheduler would work in a machine with a single processor, where every process is scheduled to use the processor for a limited amount of time, giving us the fake sense of parallelism. And the callbacks would be like a hrefhttpen.wikipedia.orgwikiInterrupt relnofollowinterruptsa.p  pThe articles do not provide any particular references, so I thought that the best source on how the JavaScript execution engine work should certainly be the language specification, and so I got me the latest copy of a hrefhttpwww.ecmainternational.orgecma2625.1 relnofollowEcmaScript 5.1a. p  pTo my great surprise I discovered that this execution behavior is not specified there. How come This looks like a fundamental design choice done in all JavaScript execution engines in browsers and in node. Interestingly, I have not been able to find a place where this is specified for any specific engine. In fact, I have no clue how people find out this is the way things work to the point that is so categorically affirmed in books and blogs like the ones cited above.p  pSo, I have a set of what I consider interesting questions. I would appreciate any answers providing insights, remarks or simply references pointing me in the right direction to understand the followingp  ul liSince the EcmaScript does not specify that the JavaScript execution engine should work with an event loop, how come may implementations of JavaScript seem to work this way, not only in browsers, but also in Node.js li liDoes that mean I could implement a new JavaScript engine which is EcmaScriptcompatible that in fact provides true multithreading capabilities with features like sychronization locks, conditions, etcli liDoes this execution model using an event loop precludes me from taking advantage of multicores if I want to execute an intense CPUbound task I mean, I can surely divide the task in chunks as explained in one of the articles, but this is still executed serially, not in parallel. So, how could a JavaScript engine take advantage of multicores to run my codeli liDo you know of any other reputable sources where this behavior for any particular JavaScript engine implementation is formally specifiedli liHow could the code be portable between libraries and engines if we cannot assume a few things about the execution environmentsli ul  pIt looks like too many questions, perhaps making this post too broad to be answered. If it gets closed I will try to ask them in different threads. But they all revolve around the fact that I want to understand better why JavScript and Node were designed with an event loop, and if this is specified somewhere besides the browsers source code that I could read and gain a deeper understanding of designs and decisions taken here and more importantly, to know exactly what is the source of information for people writing books and posts about it.p

Negative 3854 pI made a simple program in c for connecting to a site and loading a page HTML code or send data using GETPOST requests. But now I want the program to connect and sendreceive data through proxy. You probably know software like NextVpn and proxifier. when they are running any application which tries to communicate through internet will have to go through these apps. The problem is that my program connects and communicates directly and my proxy software doesnt interfere. Communication is done by the socket programming routins SOCKET class like thisp  precodeSOCKET scksocketAFINET,SOCKSTREAM,IPPROTOTCP connectsck,SOCKADDRampSockAddr,sizeofSockAddr sendsck,myRequest,strlenmyRequest,0 codepre  pAny solutionp  pEDIT The problem was from NextVPN not the Proxifier itself. It seems that NextVPN lacks functionality in hooking into some programs. First NextVPN finds the program which is trying to connect to a remote address then redirects it to its portable version of proxifier with something named compose.ns . Unfortunately it was unable or couldnt detect my app connecting to internet. Instead I used Proxifier itself and it successfully detected my app as it was showing in its connection list.p

At the moment it is going quite well, but I have a niggling bug that is just darn annoying and I cant seem to correct it. p  pBasically, I have to design a contrasting controller to enable random movement while avoiding obstacles.

Negative 3854 pI want to implement a compiletime getter in a way to make its call more concise. I have a nontype codeunsigned int Ncode class template codefoocode, which recursively inherits from codefooltN  1gtcode. Every codefoocode has its own codeenumcode member called codenumbercode, which is initialized to the value of its corresponding codeNcode. The base case is codefoolt0gtcode. For example, a codefoolt5gtcode object has 6 codeenumcodes called codenumbercode, valued code0code through code5code. I want to implement a compiletime getter codeatcode, but its not as easy as prepending a codeconstexprcode to the prototypep  precodetemplate ltunsigned int Ngt struct foo  protected fooltN  1gt  protected     enum number  N public     constexpr int constamp atconst unsigned int index          staticassertindex lt N, out of range         return thisgtfooltindexgtnumber        template ltgt struct foolt0gt  protected     enum number  0 public     constexpr int constamp atconst unsigned int index          staticassertindex  0, out of range         return thisgtnumber       codepre  pIn g 4.8, I get several instances of the errors codeerror index is not a constant expressioncode, among other things. The rest just follow suit. Even if all client code calls codeatcode with integer literals only, the getter wont compile. Whyp  pIn any case, my solution was to implement a compiletime integer wrapper. Its simply a nontype codeunsigned int Ncode class template codectintcode short for compiletime int, whose codeenumcode member codememcode is initialized to its codeNcodep  precodetemplate ltunsigned int Ngt struct ctint      enum mem  N  codepre  pSo, replacing codefooltNgtcode and codefoolt0gtcodes getter methods, respectively, withp  precodetemplate ltunsigned int indgt constexpr int constamp atctintltindgt constamp ctintpar      staticassertctintpar.mem lt N, out of range     return thisgtfooltctintpar.memgtnumber  codepre  pandp  precodetemplate ltunsigned int indgt constexpr int constamp atctintltindgt constamp ctintpar      staticassertctintpar.mem  0, out of range     return thisgtnumber  codepre  pworksp  precodeint main      foolt5gt f     staticassert f.at ctintlt4gt   4 , equals 4  codepre  pbut makes the function call verbose. Id like an implementation thats libraryfree aside from parts e.g. codeltiostreamgtcode that show something works but not help make it work. Id like the getter to be able to optionally omit or have no codeltgtcode syntax or spelling out of a type name in the call, but not necessarily in the prototype or definition. I dont want it to involve codearray[]codes. If thats impossible, Id like to know the nextbest way.p

Negative 3854 pSorry if my description sounds a bit ambiguous, but Im just hoping someone can lead me in the right direction.p  pI am designing an app that for a card game I have in mind, will allow you to put in two card names, and from that, the app will determine an assumed ruling from the rulings of the two cards. This is to alleviate any ambiguity in the descriptions of effects on the cards. The rulings of cards, are for the most part written, but they are not on the cards themselves. The app is to allow people, so if they get stuck because of ambiguous wording, can just enter the two card names, and out comes a rulings.p  pFor instance, CardA says this card gets a super boost when battling, and CardB says when battlings, stop all super boosts others get. When you enter CardA and CardB in the app, it will say something of the sort of CardAs super boost will not activate when battling CardB. Obviously this wasnt very ambgious, but its just an example.p  pI was thinking that the program could take out key phrases like other card names, battle, defense, attack, return to hand, and compare them to find related phrases from the other cards. And based on this, formulate some conclusion by piecing together a sentence from the already written ruling for each card which the app will access. Of course, if CardA is mentioned in the ruling of CardB, all Id have to do is print the sentence mentioning the other. p  pI was thinking this may be a tad similar to how Google figures out what you like by reading your emails.p  pBasically, I need help understanding how to make the relations between the cards, and how to formulate an English sentence from the comparison. p  pI dont expect anyone to sit here and tell me how to do anything, but I just need a push in the right direction. Any help you be nice. Thanks.p

Negative 3854 pIn my project I created a Plugins folder named it Plugins, of course and in it I have three plugins that get imported from my c project. Every time I hit build content I have my dlls show up into the Plugins folder.p  pThe things is that I get a DllNotFoundExeption every time I run the game and it points to two out of my three plugins. Me and my teammates found online that you can solve this by placing the dlls in the the Assets folder. We did so, and as luck would have it, that solved it, by moving the two dlls that were giving us the error it solved it. We left the one dlls that was fine where it was inside the Plugins folder.p  pBut something was nagging at the back of my head that this would not solve our entire issue, and I was right. When w build the game and create our executable only one dll gets built, which is the only one that is within the Plugins folder.p  pMy question is how do I fix my other two dlls so I dont get that DllNotFoundExeption errorp  pUPDATED REPORT I found that the one dll that works is done in C while the other two that dont seem to work inside the Plugins folder are made in C.p  pSo my new question is how do I get Unity to accept those two dlls within the Plugins folder, or is that not possible for c pluginsp

Negative 3854 pIm trying to implement a CUDA version of an algorithm to convert an image to grayscale. Ive got it working, but Im having troubles with a few of the pixels.

On log in this will go to 1 and on log out this will go to 0. When the row is set to 1 they will be displayed to their friends in the chat menu bottom right and when they are not online they will not show in the bottom right. p  pThat will work well as long as the users log out after every visit to the website and I am pretty sure that 99 will not do that what means they will always be showed as online in the private chat.p  pI know there is a way to check if someone is currently online as facebook does it and many other sites do. I was just wonderinghoping that someone on here would be able to point me into the direction on how to make the script to check to see if someone is currently online and to update this ENUM row automatically if that is the method that should be used when they have left the site and update it once again when they have come back to the website.p  pThe reason I have included my check login status script is because I am not sure if the code will need to be in here as this script is included in every page on the website.p  pI do believe that javascript maybe needed for this and that is why I tagged it.p  pThank you for reading and I look forward to your help.p

Since the file can get quite long. and I would like to force the browser to display the end of the file by default.p  pThis is an example of a Verdict test log ... p  precode    ltDOCTYPE htmlgt     lthtmlgt     ltheadgt     lttitlegtInProgress 13022601NickAnExampleTestlttitlegt     ltmeta httpequivrefresh content60gt     ltstylegt     body          fontsize75     fontfamilyverdana,arial,sans serif     backgroundcolorFFFFF0     color000080     marginleft20px          pass marginleft30px colordarkgreen     fail marginleft30px colordarkred     testIter marginleft30px     iterResult  marginleft50px     testResult  marginleft10px     testResPass marginleft10px colordarkgreen     testResFail marginleft10px colordarkred     ltstylegt     ltheadgt      ltpgt     ltpgtPython Test Automation  myDUT  SmokeTstPwrOnATCmd gt General Smoke Tests  Power On, AT Response     ltpgtTestcase start  021814 071613     ltpgt     ltpgtampnbsp     ltpgt     ltpgt  tcID SmokeTstPwrOnATCmd    ueID myDUT                 ltpgt     ltpgtTest Case start 021814 071648     ltpgt Iteration 1   021814 071658      ltp idtestItergtTestPowerOn 1  UE Boards are alive and well ...      ltp idtestItergtIteration 1 PowerOn Test Successful     ltp idtestItergtRouterConfiguration 1  Router configured and responding to AT Commands ...      ltp idtestItergtIteration 1 Router Setup Test Successful     ltp idpassgtIteration 1 PASS     ltp idtestResultgtTest Case finish 021814 072009     ltp idtestResultgtTest Case time 002 min 00     ltp idtestResPassgtTC overall result  PASS      ltp idtestResultgtNumber of iterations 1     ltp idtestResultgtNumber of executed iterations 1     ltp idtestResultgtNumber of failed iterations 0     ltp idtestResultgtNumber of crashes 0     ltp idtestResultgtexecuteTestAsSubProcess TestCase SmokeTstPwrOnATCmdmyDUT ...

Negative 3854 pI have such a task in my collegebrbr emUsing JSP create a site that allows a client to play Tic Tac Toe. Every move shall be controlled by the server. Game status should be remembered in the session and every move shall be realised by calling the same .jsp page with appropriate parameter, what will cause drawing it again with a properly updated board. ... Whole task should be delivered in on JSP file, no war, ear or app files. Structures remembered in session may be standard JDK classes, e.g. HashSet.em brbr I hope that I have translated it well enough as the task is written in my native language. brAnyway what I would like to ask you is what would be a good way to do it and what should I pay attention to I am a noobie, never have used JSP before, and also have rather limited programming knowledge. What would be a good way to create the board buttons table, to collect data from user sending a form after clicking on buttons, what methods could be useful I have followed a basic tutorial on JSP and but still Im not sure hot to approach this task. p  pThanks in advancep

Negative 3854 pMy project which can be found at a hrefhttpsgithub.comrahul080327medusa relnofollowThe Medusa Projecta aims at running Python much faster by compiling it to Dart and running it on the Dart Virtual Machine. Alls fine and Im achieving up to 1500 speed boosts over the the usual CPython implementation.p  pMy next objective is to provide a error reporting mechanism to the project. When the Python code gets compiled to a optimized and compressed Dart code, all the line numbers and related debugging info is lost. So during run time, if something goes wrong somewhere the error arises from the Dart VM and as expected, the VM reports errors in the LineColumn in the generated Dart file. What I want is a way to point out the error in the corresponding line of the Python file.p  pCurrently Im translating The Python code to Dart using the NodeVisitor class provided by the ast module. I visit each node in the AST and generate the Drat code for the node. Im in a fix how to maintain the line numbers of where i got the Python code. Should I go for Debugging Symbol table like implementation which CC compilers use for debugging purposes or should I go for a hand written parserp  pSample Translationp  pPython codep  precodea  inputEnter a number  b  inputEnter another number   print a  b print a  b print a  b print a  b codepre  pCorresponding Dart Codep  precodeimportfileCUsersRahul.medusalibinbuilts.dartimportdartiovar a,bmainainputstrEnter a number binputstrEnter another number stdout.writelnabstdout.writelnabstdout.writelnabstdout.writelnab codepre  pSuppose if b is 0 here, I want the error to show that if happened at line 7 of the Python file not at 1245 of the Dart file.p  pThanksp

Negative 3854 pSo I have this issue where Im developing a local web application and sometimes I might not have internet access. I do know that GMaps isnt all that happy when it loses internet connection so I was wondering whether theres a way of saving the state of a part of google maps tiles, markers and lines for a zonecity. Or a google map equivalent that would let me do something like that, by which I mean building graphical asses on a map zone and keep that state even if the uses loses internet connectionp

Negative 3854 pIm developing a Spring MVC Application, Ive done the basic crud functionality, but I want my codeupdatecode operation to be thread safe, so one and only one person can edit the object. So Ive done a mechanical approach, which relies on creating an attribute codeinUsecode, so whenever a user wants to edit the object, the codeinUsecode attribute is set to code1code,so no other user can edit this object. Clearly its not the best thing to do, because I cant know if the resource is free or not after editing   For example if the user click on edit then close the page, the object will be locked indeterminably p  pCan I solve this issue using Spring Batch  is there any better approach to do this using Spring MVC  Thanks.p

Negative 3854 pI am currently creating an app using drag and drop from the intel xdkapp designer. The idea of the app is to create basic tutorials for the user and also to use the geolocation tool. I have created the app mostly by using the app beginner tutorials from the intel website. the tutorials worked well for doing the basics such as adding images and navigation  between pages. However, when I added the geolocation, the program, which is temperamental and freezing at the best of times, deleted a couple of pages. I had copied the code into word and when I copied the code back to try and restore the pages, the app has started to display the footers on top of the headers. The headers and annoyingly, even the footers themselves which are still at the bottom, are all compressed over to one side of the screen and not evenly distributed as they should be.

Negative 3854 pI have a Jar File which run the applet. This Jar File is called by  CallAppletJar.html  file which is in www directory. The CallAppletJar.html file has a javascript and html codes. The Jar File is called by html codes which are in CallAppletJar.html. The applet opens too late on browsers. For example applet opens in five seconds with unix o.ss browsers   despite this the applet opens in 15 seconds with windows o.ss browsers. Namely applet run quick on unixs browsers  but it can not run quick on windowss browsers. So that I want to show progress bar while the applet is loading. But I cant understand when the applet becomes fully operational on browser. Namely  I must know loading times start and finish point to add progress bar. How to understand time when the applet becomes fully operational on browser with Javascript or HTML. The progress bar must disappear when the applet becomes full operational on web browsers. How can i know this time with javascript or htmlAny idea Thanks in advance ..p

Negative 3854 pIm developing code for the NXP LPC1788 microcontroller, and part of my work is making the product based on it USBcompatible. Most of the legwork is done and in general communication over USB works almost as well as over CAN.p  pHowever, one of the issues Ive been encountering is that, when producing a constant output of USB messages from the microcontroller that are sent pretty close together, some of these messages are occasionally dropped.p  pIm using a custom driver I wrote based on WinUSB to receive the messages on the PC side, and I originally suspected that the problem was on the receiving end of things. However, using USBLyzer Im now confident that the problem is on the sending side  the USBLyzer logs perfectly match logs produced from what I get out of emWinUsbReadPipeem.p  pThe LPC1788 uses USB 2.0 Full Speed protocol and Ive confirmed that information is being sent and received at around 12 MHz using a probe, which is what it should be.p  pThe device is configured to make use of two endpoints logical endpoint 2 IN and logical endpoint 2 OUT. Both of these are configured for bulk transfer with a maximum packet size of 64 bytes.p  pI would emthinkem that messages are being sent around 500600 microseconds apart at the least Ive introduced an artificial 500 us delay in the thread and message transmission should take a lot less time than that. This is about what I got last week I cant check now as my debugging tools are acting up.p  pThis is the USB initialisation code for the microcontrollerp  precodevoid USBInit       Configure USB pins.

Negative 3854 pI have a simple Meteor js app that allows you to create a user account and log in, or to log in with your existing Google account via oauth thanks to the codeaccountsgooglecode package.p  pWhen using the app, I enter my username and password, everything works fine.

I select the account, the pop up waits a second, closes, and then nothing happens.  No popups being blocked, no failed login messages.  Its as if nothing happened at all.p  pIm certain that the user is never being defined when I use oauth login because codeMeteor.usercode gives me codenullcode in the JS console.p  pWhat could be going on here  Or how would I debug this  Suggestions appreciated.p  pp.s.

Negative 3854 pIm working with a nested list. Im using a for loop to iterate through it. Sometimes a particular item in the list is dependent on a subsequent nested list. I tried iterating and using next, but that uses up the items that I have not accessed yet. Here is my list. When I look at the first nested list, I dont want to print it if a subsequent list has data that refers to an apple and says that it was a badapple. There could be future nested lists that are followed by goodapple, and I would want to print that one.p  precodefruit  [   [apple, round, small, red],    [banana, long, large, yellow],   [apple, round, large, badapple]   [apple, round, medium, red],    [banana, long, large, yellow],   [apple, round, large, goodapple]  ]  for i in fruit      print i only if there is no badapple in the following 3 nested lists     print i codepre  pSo in this example, I would not want to print the first apple, the small one, but I would want to print the 2nd apple, the medium one since it is followed by a subsequent list that has goodapple in the list. I only want to see 2 or 3 nested lists into the future.p

When we hit enter again to print codebcodes,p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comzvz7R.jpg altenter image description herep  pEverything works as expected. Ive used absolute cursor positioning, and written to the same rows I wrote to previously  which of course doesnt overwrite all of the as, because many of them are on other rows.p  pHowever, when we narrow the window by one more character, the wrapping works differentlyp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comGzizK.jpg altenter image description herep  pWhy did the second and third rows of codebcode wrap together, and why did last line of codeacodes merge with the first line of bs A hint of why is in the top visible row above  we see two codeacodes because theyse two rows are still linked  of course if we move the window again, that one line will continue to wrap the same way. This seems to be happening even for lines which we replaced a whole row of.p  pIt turns out that the rows that had wrapped before are now linked to their corresponding parent rows its more obvious that they belong to the same logical line once we widen the terminal a lot p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comgcR7Z.jpg altenter image description herep  h2My questionh2  pPractically, my question is how to prevent or predict this rowsbeingcombinedintolines. Clearing the whole screen eliminates the behavior, but it would be nice to do this only for individual lines that need it if possible so I can keep the caching by line that is significantly speeding up my application. Clearing to the end of a row unlinks that row from the row below it, but clearing to the beginning of a row does not unlink that row from the one above it.p  pIm curious  what are these line things Where can I read about them Can I find out which rows are part of the same linep  pIve observed this behavior with terminal.app and iterm, with and wo tmux. I imagine sourcediving into any of these would yield an answer even if theres no spec  but I imagine theres a spec somewherep  hr  pBackground Id like to make a terminal user interface that can predict the way terminal wrapping will occur if the user decreases the window width. Im aware of things like fullscreen mode codetput smcupcode, or codepython c print x1b[1049hcode, which are what ncurses uses which would work for preventing line wrap, but dont want to use it here.p  pEdit made it more clear that I understand the overwriting behavior of the script already and want an explanation of the wrapping behavior.p

Negative 3854 pI have a codestdvectorcode, that I use codestdheapcode on it.p  pI want in a while loop, to pop the minimum value, every time the loop starts. In the body of the loop, another element will be inserted in the heap. The loop stops after a number of runs.p  pWhat came to my mind is to use codestdsortheapcode and then erase the first element. However, this doesnt seem to be a good idea. You see, speed is of real essence at this part of my code.p  pI dont think that this is a good idea, because I have to call codestdsortheapcode at every run, because an element is going to be inserting, thus making the codestdvectorcode a heap again, which means that I have to sort it again, in order the minimum element to be placed at the front.p  pMoreover, erasing from start, with codevector.erasecode is slower than erasing the last element, right If I delete the first element, then all the others have to be moved one position to the left. If I delete the last, element, I just pay the cost of deletion.p  pThat lead me to this idea, sort the vector my way, so that the minimum element will come to the end, thus paying the deletion of the last element only. However, this still requires sorting at every run of the loop, rightp  pWhich is the optimal approach to tackle this problemp

This is data for one person only, there are multiple people who can have the same position in different companies etc. I need to put it into Neo4j and make it searchable p  precode           id 123,      name Foo Bar,      email ,      workhistory          positions [                           company Company A,               employees ,               type Privately Held,               start 1356998400,               end ,               position Position A,               description ,               industry some industry            ,                           company Company B,               employees ,               type Privately Held,               start 1356998400,               end ,               position Position B,               description ,               industry some industry            ,                           company Company C,               employees ,               type Privately Held,               start 1341100800,               end ,               position Position A,               description ,               industry                      ]          codepre  pI want to be able to search for a position node with a name property called Position A, then find all the people with this position and return their profile with the same structure it had when it was put into the database, give or take.p  pSame goes for industry and company, I want to break those off into separate nodes as well. The database will have millions of people in it.p  h3Edit 3h3  pIm thinking of maybe adding the position as a node, with a name property etc. And then also add the position name on the relationship from person to company. This will make it easy to query for work history, but will take extra space for each WORKEDAT relationship the WORKEDAT.position property. With this structure I can do searches on a position node as well, and get all the people related to a certain position. p  pThis will probably be ok for this easy structure, but then what about more nested values Like Person lives in City located in State located in Country etc p

Negative 3854 pIm trying to render text on a map using an MKOverlayRenderer. I have an existing, functional MKOverlayRenderer rendering a set of points, so my only problem is rendering a piece of text for each point within the voiddrawMapRectMKMapRectmapRect zoomScaleMKZoomScalezoomScale inContextCGContextRefcontext function.p  pAll solutions I have found through SO and Google use annotations or UILabels. But I want to have the text drawing code in the same location as the code rendering the points. Also there are about 10,000 points, though Im ensuring its not rendering them all at the same time through zoom and bounds checking. I am reasonably sure I dont want to create 10,000 objects with the other solutions.p  pThis is the current test code I have to try to render one of the Text Text items. It is a combination of some of the methods I have found on the net to try to render something.p  precodeCGPoint point  self.pointList.pointArray  pointIndex CGContextSetRGBFillColorcontext, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0 CGContextSetRGBStrokeColorcontext, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0 CGContextSelectFontcontext, Helvetica, 20.f, kCGEncodingFontSpecific CGContextSetTextDrawingModecontext, kCGTextFill CGAffineTransform xform  CGAffineTransformMake1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0 CGContextSetTextMatrixcontext, xform CGContextShowTextAtPointcontext, pointgtx, pointgty, Test Text 1, 11 CGContextShowTextAtPointcontext, 10, 10, Test Text 2, 11 CGContextShowTextcontext, Test Text 4, 11 UIFont font  [UIFont fontWithNameHelvetica size12.0] [Test Text 3 drawAtPointpoint withFontfont] codepre  pThis is my first SO questions, so sorry if it isnt that correct.p  pstrongEditstrong I just saw the text when zoomed in as far as I can go, so realise I havent been accounting for the zoom scale. Assuming I need to do a scale transform before rendering to account for it. Havent solved it currently, but I think I am on my way.p

Negative 3854 pIm newbie using DataTables and I need to add a first column on my DataTables elements to mark individual rows and dont know how to do this right now so any help will be appreciated.

Negative 3854 pI have an Android app that uses a KitKatlevel WebView to display documents primarily as an ereader which consumes HTML files. When a user opens a document within the app and thus the webview is thus newly instantiated for that document I want to scroll to the last known cursor location within the document, so that the user can pick up reading where they left off. Obviously I retain and persist the cursor location indepedently of the webview to allow such scrolling when I first open up the document.p  pPROBLEM When the document first opens, I can see the initial highlighting of the last known location cursor in my javascript document, but then in perhaps 50 of the cases Ive seen the document somehow scrolls back to the top and so the cursor location is no longer shown. How and why it scrolls back to the top in these cases is a mystery to me I dont believe I programatically make it scroll back to the top in any way. p  pNOTES To achieve the scrolling within the webview Im using a javascript function which is invoked from my webview fragment via webview.loadUrl once the webview has signalled it has loaded and ready to use. This is the callback from the document view fragment to the webviewp  pdiv classsnippet datalangjs datahidefalse div classsnippetcode pre classsnippetcodehtml langhtml prettyprintoverridecodeTargetApiBuild.VERSIONCODES.KITKAT SuppressLintClickableViewAccessibility Override public View onCreateViewLayoutInflater inflater, ViewGroup container, Bundle savedInstanceState  View mainView  inflater.inflateR.layout.documentwebviewreader, container, false getReaderActivity.setFooterLocationBarValuesmainView  mWebviewLoading  true final WebView webview  WebView mainView.findViewByIdR.id.documentwebReaderwebView webview.getSettings.setJavaScriptEnabledtrue webview.getSettings.setAllowFileAccessFromFileURLstrue  webview.getSettings.setAllowUniversalAccessFromFileURLstrue webview.setScrollBarStyleView.SCROLLBARSINSIDEOVERLAY webview.setBackgroundColor0 webview.setBackgroundColorColor.LTGRAY  ifBuild.VERSION.SDKINT gt Build.VERSIONCODES.KITKAT       WebView.setWebContentsDebuggingEnabledtrue   mJsInterface  new JsCall webview.addJavascriptInterfacemJsInterface, mJsInterface.getInterfaceName  webview.setWebViewClientnew WebViewClient  public void onPageFinishedWebView view, String url  drawInitialCursorgetDocument.getCursorRange     private void drawInitialCursorfinal WordRange range  if getReaderActivity.activityIsPaused  return      getActivity.runOnUiThreadnew Runnable   Override public void run  Log.dReaderApplication.VDREADERTAG,highlighting initial range WordRange currentFragmentRange  mTextFragmentRanges.getmCurrentTextFragmentIndex int relativeLocation  range.getLocation  currentFragmentRange.getStartRange WordRange rangeInCurrentFragment  new WordRangerelativeLocation, range.getLength  WebView webview  WebView getActivity.findViewByIdR.id.documentwebReaderwebView  String applyString  String.formatjavascripthighlightInitialRanged,d,d,d,  rangeInCurrentFragment.getStartRange,rangeInCurrentFragment.getEndRange,  mCurrentTextFragmentIndex, mCursorPositionSetting.ordinal  webview.loadUrlapplyString   codepre div div p  pThe javascript for highlightInitialRange isp  pdiv classsnippet datalangjs datahidefalse div classsnippetcode pre classsnippetcodejs langjs prettyprintoverridecodefunction highlightInitialRangestart, end, elementIndex, cursorPagePositionSetting              if wordHighlightApplier  null               wordHighlightApplier  rangy.createClassAppliervoicedreamspokenword,                  elementTagName vdword                               if selRange  null               selRange  rangy.createRange                   wordHighlightApplier.undoToRangeselRange         varmyNodelist  document.querySelectorAllVDcssSelector          selRange.selectCharactersmyNodelist[elementIndex], start, end         wordHighlightApplier.applyToRangeselRange          var wordCursor  document.getElementsByTagNamevdword         wordCursor[0].scrollIntoViewtrue      codepre div div p  pThe above javascript essentially just finds the relevant range in the document as a combination of element index and offset within that element, applies a highlight to it via rangy and then scrolls that highlighted element into view.p  pAs I say I know this strategy generally works since I can always see it highlighting the correct location when the document is loaded and the webview is ready to use but in 50 of the times I run this, I see the cursor highlight briefly and then it disappears as the document is scrolled back to the top assuming the cursor range is beyond the initial page of the document of course.p  p I would post an image of the correct cursor highlight here but apparently Im not reputable enough to allow such a triviality. p  pQUESTION Am I missing something about webview document rendering here I know everything is working correctly in terms of highlighting and the initial scrollintoview for the highlighted element, and Im only executing this highlighting code once the webview is fully loaded notified via onPageFinished on the webview client. Is there something within the webview itself that is nondeterministically executing when the document is fully loaded to ensure that the document is displayed at its topmost scroll positionp  p RESOLVED BY OWNERp  pIn hindsight the resolution to this problem was fairly obvious I was using a wrapper html document in which I loaded various JS libraries  JSQuery, Rangy etc, and within that I was using JSQuery to replace the document body with the real html document I want to loadread. So from a HTML document point of view the loading was occurring in two phasesp  ol liLoad the wrapper li liWrapper loads the real html document via body.loadli ol  pBecause of this twophase loading, my app was seeing the Webview.onPageFinished event being fired  but this only signalled the loading of the wrapper html, not the full body. So all I needed to do was add an explicit call from my webview  javascript to the app once the JSQuery .load method had completed successfully p  pdiv classsnippet datalangjs datahidefalse div classsnippetcode pre classsnippetcodejs langjs prettyprintoverridecodeltbodygt ltscriptgt      body .load s, function response, status, xhr               if status  error                      var msg  Sorry but there was an error              error.htmlmsg  xhr.status     xhr.statusText                  else                       append our line highlight div, floating             var newDiv  ltdiv idvdspokenline classvoicedreamspokenlinegt              body .appendnewDiv              notifyDocumentBodyLoaded    lt new callback to android app here               ltscriptgt ltbodygtcodepre div div p  pSo then notifyDocumentBodyLoaded executes the Androidjava code formerly executed in the onPageFinished method, but only after the true document body has been loaded by JSQuery. That way the sequence of loading  cursor drawing all happens in the correct order. Solved.p
Negative 3854 pI need to place a CView derived class into a CDockablePane. Is there any code example somewhere, or can someone provide such codep  pWhat I triedp  pApparently should be simple, online I found advice like just create the view and set its parent to be the dialog or the dockable pane or what kind of window you want. But for some reason it doesnt work, maybe is because it needs a CFrameWnd, I dont know.p  pAnyway, I need to be able to do this without creating another document template class. Just to work with preexisting document and view classes.p

Negative 3854 pSo I tried loading some postcode and address data into neo4j. I pute a unique constraint there are effectively three labels. POSTCODE, ADDRESS, and REGION. REGION and POSTCODE have unique constraints on their single property. The query we use for insertion will MERGE REGION, MERGE POSTCODE CREATE ADDRESS, and then CREATE RELATIONSHIPS. The idea is to be able to see what postcodes are in which region, and how many addresses share a single postcode, so the MERGE behaviour is important.p  pHowever, we have found this to be very slow once the database gets to even quite a moderate size. Now we expected this, but we expected that constrain checks should scale as logn. Instead, the performance is linear in the size of database, which is very unexpected.p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comxXEjR.png altenter image description herep  pWhat can I do to improve this without giving up the MERGE behaviour Is this a consequence of the UNIQUE constraint In theory there should be no difference between having a unique constraint and just having an index when you use merge since there is only one property. Either way merge needs to know if the property exists to decide whether to merge.p  pIm aware that I can do various things to speed up the insertion, use the csv loader, etc. I am interested in here in improving the asymptotic performance. I thought unique constraints should have a time cost of Ologn, not On, and that potentially makes a huge difference.p  pEDIT Further investigation has revealed that the issue is not index look ups, but Rtree insertion into the spatial layer. The particular code being used for insertion utilised the embedded API, not cypher, and the snippetp  precodegraphDB.index.forNodess.addnode, dummy, variable codepre  pgets progressively slower at On as the size of the tree expands. This is apparently the expected behaviour for RTrees. This takes about 0.0005  Number of nodes in the layer. With the spatial insertion removed it goes orders of magnitude faster and shows no scaling behavior. I assume that the decrease is just due to the cache warming up after starting.p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comSBtFF.jpg altenter image description herep  pIncidentially, I am using the following code to start up the spatial indexp  precodeMapltString, Stringgt config  SpatialIndexProvider.SIMPLEPOINTCONFIG             Transaction tx  graphDB.beginTx             IndexManager indexMan  graphDB.index             try                 indexMan.forNodeslab.name, config                 tx.success              finally                  tx.close              codepre  pAs this makes gives you the Cypher entry point, but is there a qualititive differences between indexes and layers Would a layer have better performance than the index, or are they both backed by identical Rtrees.p  pThe suggestion at this question a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions24973841neo4jhugeperformancedegradationafterrecordsaddedtospatiallayerNeo4J huge performance degradation after records added to spatial layera seems to be that I should put all the nodes into the database before I start the spatial layer, as it will index much faster than incremental insertion. p  pIll Try that tomorrow.p

Negative 3854 pMy app is a kind of social media, where users can post various things to be seen by others using the app.  I would like to have it set up in Parse so that when they see the Table View of posts, the profile picture for each user is displayed as the cells codeimageViewcode.  However, Im not quite sure what the best way would be to do this.p  pOn my core data, I have User which has all the Users info created at signup.  I also have another database named Posts, which contains all the posted materials.  I could upload a file to Posts with each post, but that seems like it would use too much data and take too long.  So, I thought, I can just put a profile picture in User, but here is the issuep  pAll the posts are on Posts, so I use PFQueryTableViewController to load the class Posts.

Negative 3854 pWas just thinking about this today and it made me curious. p  pIf I have some elements or divs on a site, such as a video tag, if I set this video tag to display none in a media query for mobile users. p  pWhen those users view the site on their devices, will the site still load in the video and its elements, then hide them Or does it prevent the elements from being loaded in p  pWill it affect load time p  pI have a site with html5 video for desktop and when scaled down it replaces these elements with a gif for mobile devices since html5 cant auto play on ios devices. Does that mean by selecting display none it is preventing the videos or whatever other elements from affecting the mobile load timep

I tried to run it in R2011b and it threw the exception Undefined variable Simulink or class Simulink.Mask.createp  pSince 1 Simulink is installed and functional in this R2011b 2 I have already run the same code in a R2014b successfully I conclude that this is a problem of compatibility In contrast to their claim, their code is compatible for some version later than R2011b.p  pI wish I could contribute with them by directly telling them, not only that their code is not compatible with Matlab 7.6, but also the earliest version in which the statement associated with Simulink.Mask.create would run. p  pSo, in precise terms, MY QUESTION IS Given a command, builtin function, namespace resolution sequence, or whatever feature that I can find in some version of Matlab, what is the way of knowing what is the earliest version in which that feature is activep  pI have tried a hrefhttpwww.mathworks.comhelpsimulinkreleasenotes.html relnofollowhttpwww.mathworks.comhelpsimulinkreleasenotes.htmla which is not searchable or navigable the way I wish it was.p

Negative 3854 pIm creating a consolebased Evil Hangman program. Instead of selecting a word at the beginning of the game, a list of words is progressively narrowed down by selecting out words that contain letters that the user inputs.p  pThis is a pretty common assignment, so Im sure that youve heard of something similar before. p  pHere is the specification, in case if you need more clarification.p  pa hrefhttpcourses.cs.washington.educoursescse14315wihomework5spec.pdf relnofollowSpecificationap  pNecessary file and client for compilationp  pa hrefhttpcourses.cs.washington.educoursescse14315wihomework5dictionary.txt relnofollowFileap  pa hrefhttpcourses.cs.washington.educoursescse14315wihomework5HangmanMain.java relnofollowHangmanMainap  pThe problematic method in this particular class is the record method, which is by far the most difficult method to program in this assignment. There are two main problems that Im observingp  pa There is the following NullPointerException that I cant figure out the reason for. Its occurring at a line where a word is being added to the list. As far as I can tell, the word and the list should both exist and are both initialized. Its not a matter of the list not containing a word or of the list not being properly initialized. It seems to only happen after the second user input.p  precodeException in thread main java.lang.NullPointerException at HangmanManager.recordHangmanManager.java66 at HangmanMain.playGameHangmanMain.java59 at HangmanMain.mainHangmanMain.java39 codepre  pb The NullPointerException is probably caused at my earlier attempts to fix another problem. Before the NullPointerException occurred, I was experiencing problems determining why the word selected by the program wasnt following the expected output. No matter what I did, the word selected by the program at the end of the traversal would always be aa.

I tried calling assignPermissions like mentioned in a hrefhttpapigee.comdocsapibaascontentusingpermissions relnofollowApigee documenta but that didnt solve the problem. I even provide accesstoken with the call, even though I shouldnt have to.p  pIn the attempt to avoid calling login also tried calling storeOAuth2TokensInKeychain and retrieveStoredOAuth2TokensFromKeychain mentioned a hrefhttpsblog.apigee.comdetailoauth20supportinapigeeandroidandiossdks relnofollowherea. That didnt work either.p  pThe only thing way to resolve this error is by calling logInUser before making a call to updateEntity.

Negative 3854 pI tried to read many forums, articles, but still dont know which one should I choose.p  pConsider a small multiplayer puzzle game, client runs on Android device. Server is a dedicated rented pc, with Win server.brLets say one game consists of 3 players ABC. When 3 players are ready, game starts server sends notification currentPlayerA to ABC. On the phone, A becomes playable, BC are blockedobservers only. When A done, sends next to server, server sends notification currentPlayerB to ABC.... so on...p  pThis is a very simplified model of course during game more communication should happen, as BC wants to see what A is doing while they are blockedobservers, etc  but enough for my question.p  pSo I need a strongbidirectional communicationstrong platform. The information to send is usually small, but happens quite frequently, so dont want big overhead for every messages, so I guess a permanent connection looks what I need.p  pHTTP based stuff is out of question, as that is Client  Server only. Ok, I can ask periodically what is the current state of the game from every Client, but that is horrible. Also here, I need to establish the connection before every request, looks too much.p  pThen I thought strongsocketsstrong. They are always connected fast communication, permanent connection. Looks ok, but the problem, if I have 100K games, thats 300K socket connections. But AFAIK server can handle max 65K ports  address. Thats not enough. Not to mention, that would mean 300K threads on the server thread per each socket connection. Is there any average PC which can handle it The server has no game logic, only dispatching the info among players, so threads dont do much.br I thought maybe use several ports, lets say server accepts 80008999, that would mean 1K  65K max connection. And when client connects, it can choose a random port to connect, to balance it. Could it work However, the thread number is still can be an issue on the server maybep  pWhat do you think guys, other suggestions, approachp  pstrongEDITstrongbr I thought an other idea what if during online game, I leave the server out one player will be the socket server on his phone lets say player A, and the others B and C will connect to As phone Server will be used only for organizing the game, storing scores, etc.p  pThxp

Negative 3854 pI understand how to convert a single codecharcode to an codeintcode, but how can I convert a codeStringcode to codecharcodes, so I can convert the codecharcodes to codeintcodes For example, for the string codehellocodep  precodechars[1]  h gt 104 chars[2]  e gt 101 chars[3]  l gt 108 chars[4]  l gt 108 chars[5]  o gt 111 codepre  pThe output should make it easy to convert fiveletter codeStringcodes to five separate integers, each representing one character, then convert them back to codecharcode and print them as a single codeStringcode again.p

Negative 3854 pI have been thinking about strongpathfindingstrong for an android game Im warming up to start creating for the last few days, and there is something I just cant get my head around. p  pI know that most games use emA pathfindingem, and for that you need the game world to be simplified, like a emgraphem or emgridem. For my game, I imagine a codeboolean[][]code will do the trick, codetruecode if its a grid that units can move in, and codefalsecode if they cant. p  pIm imagining units will have mass by giving them a position and a radius, if two units are close enough that their codedistance lt radius  radiuscode, they will be moved apart until their radius no longer overlaps. The problem I cant wrap my head around is thisp  pImagine 3 units codeacode, codebcode and codeccode. codeacode and codebcode are allies, codeccode is their enemy. codeacode and codebcode are moving towards codeccode in a line, with codeacode being in front of codebcode. When codeacode gets within range of codeccode, it stops moving and starts attacking codeccode. p  pHow do I make codebcode go around codeacode so he can also get in range Should units mark the codebooleancode in the codegridcode they are in as codefalsecode when they stand still, and use emA pathfindingem to find the path for codebcode to get around codeacode Maybe also mark the points in the grid that are within codeacodes radius as codefalsecode to include its mass in the pathfinding Or is there a better way to represent the game world so units can find their way around each other Keeping in mind that its for Android, where memory is very limited.p  pI would love it if the movement of units could act like creeps do in league of legends, and would really like to know how real strategy game engines do it. Is it a twodimensional array, a graph of waypoints or some third data structure that I cant think of, that they use to control unit movementp  pIn league of legends, it looks like creeps move in lanes by following a series of waypoints, moving towards the next waypoint whenever they get within a certain range of the current target waypoint, but how do they move around each other Starcraft 2 also has some very nice fluent unit movement, especially zerglings when they swarm around.p
Negative 3854 pI have an InfoPath form that users fill in. It gets assigned a unique report number, and on the report they can select zero or more affected parts each of which have a bunch of columns. This list of affected parts can change as the report is processed. Submitting or resubmitting the report to SharePoint calls a SQL stored procedure with parameters including the column data semicolondelimited with one codeNVARCHARMAXcode representing multiple rows in one column. The stored procedure parses the semicolondelimited codeNVARCHARcodes to fill in a table variable, then merges that table variable with the main table that will be used for data analysis. Everything works great when the user only has one affected part with a given part number per report since my codeMERGEcode statement uses that to determine if it needs to update an existing row or create a new one, and initially that was an acceptable restriction.

Negative 3854 pI am making a simple system in Shiny that consist in a textBox and a number of checkboxes below it. I want that the user enters his ID into the textBox and automatically the system generates a text file with the name of the file the same as the user ID. I mean if the user enters 1234Q as his ID, then the system will generate a file named 1234Q. So far I have done the followingp  precodepart of the ui.R file libraryshiny shinyUIfluidPage   titlePanelh2Title,   textbox for entering person data   textInputtext2, label  h3Personal ID, value  ,   verbatimTextOutputtextBoxvalue,   hr,     mainPanel     textOutputtext1,     some checkboxes here     actionButtonaction, label  Next       codepre  pand my server.R is roughly the followingp  precodesw0 shinyServerfunctioninput, output, session    outputtextBoxvalue lt renderPrint inputtext2    observe       fileNameDataltrenderText inputtext2        fileNameltltpastefileNameData,sep.,txt      if sw0     some operations here     catsomeData,filefileName,appendTRUE,sep, save data codepre  pThe problem that I have is that after the user inputs his ID I got that data into the fileName variable, which I intend to use it for saving the data that I will obtain after the ifsw0 part, but nothing happens. For what I see the program  bypasses the observe part and goes directly to evaluate the ifsw0 part. I have tried by using isolate and no luck at all. What can I do to solve thisp  pUpdatep  pI have done something like the followingp  precodeshinyServerfunctioninput, output, session    data received from the textbox, we need to save a file with this name only once    observe   observe     fileNameDataltrenderText inputtext2      printfileNameData       fileNameltltpastefileNameData,sep.,txt    isolate      end of data received from the textbox   if sw0 codepre  pwhich roughly works fine, but I am missing the first data to be enter this because my filename is empty.p  pPD. In summary I just need the value of the text that the user inputs into a textfield and with that create a file with the same name. That process should be made only once.p

Negative 3854 pIm trying to test a websocket server that my company wrote for an embedded system using the Autobahn test suite using the fuzzingclient mode. The websocket server requires a basic authentication i.e, Authorization header, but I cant find any information on how to add that header to the Autobahn test.  I get Connection was refused by other side 10061 No connection could be made because the target machine actively refused it.. when running the test suite. Looking at the WireShark capture, the websocket server correctly responds to the request to open the stream with a 401 Unauthorized. So how can I added the Authorization header to the Autobahn test suite clientp

Negative 3854 pI have been using function based views for quite some time but never used class based views until now. My current project requires a lot of common code across multiple views and hence I am exploring class based views so that I can use inheritance.p  pMy requirement is to direct a url to a particular function in the class.

Negative 3854 pGolang provides JSON codecs out of the box via encodingjson. Though, it only allows to parse byte stream directly into structures. If you need some delayed parsing, youll have to store raw byte slices and then reparse them.p  pWhat Id like to do is parse the whole textual stream into structures, but keep part of it as raw JSON tree, likep  precodetype Foo struct      Foos map[string]interface     Bars []interface  codepre  pThen, do some minimal introspection over interface like check whether its a map or slice, and then continue its parsing based on these results  obtain some structs tree not from code[]bytecode, but from codeinterfacecode.p  pIs there some package in golang world which introduces this indirection capabilityp  pThanksp  pstrongEDITstrong I read suggested answers.

Negative 3854 pMy application needs to interact with a COM object that, for reasons irrelevant to this post, cannot be added to my project as a reference.  I thought the C dynamic keyword would be the perfect solution, but am running into RuntimeBinderException when trying to access documented members that I believe to be accurate.p  pFor completeness, I am working against the HP Application Lifecycle Management ALM OTA COM library for ALM 12.20, although I am going to generalize what I think might be happening without referring to those objects directly.p  pConsider the following code structure of the COM objects in C syntax for readabilityp  precodepublic interface InterfaceA      string PropertyA  get    public interface InterfaceB      string PropertyB  get    public class ClassA  InterfaceA      public string PropertyA  get    public class ClassB  ClassA, InterfaceB      public string PropertyB  get   codepre  pThis is this basic signature of a method on an object that returns the object I need to usep  precodepublic InterfaceA ReturnObject       Returns object that implements InterfaceA and also InterfaceB     var myClassB  new ClassB     return myClassB  codepre  pAnd the following shows the basics of how I consume those objects disregard specific syntaxp  precodedynamic dynamicClassB  someOtherDynamicObject.ReturnObject Debug.WriteLinedynamicClassB.PropertyA   this works Debug.WriteLinedynamicClassB.PropertyB   this throws RuntimeBinderException codepre  pI did not author this COM library, so Im not entirely certain of the object and interface relationships, but I believe the pseudocode accurately reflects what is happening.p  pNormally, youd have to explicitly cast ClassA to ClassB in order to access the property of the the ClassB object, but my understanding of the C dynamic keyword is that this should not be necessary and may not even be possible.  At runtime, its possible that the dynamic object is being resolved as an instance of ClassA instead of ClassB, perhaps due to the signature of the method that returned the object since it defined ClassA as the return type.p  pIve used dynamic successfully for many of the COM objects in this library, but am specifically having trouble with a few of the methodsproperties on an instance of a class that is like ClassB in this example.p  pThoughtsideasworkarounds are appreciated.  The only thing I cant do is directly reference the COM DLL in my project.  Thanks in advance.p
