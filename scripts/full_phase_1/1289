Positive 1289 pI am following a SQL tutorial about connecting the database to my C program so so far when I just include sql, sqlext, afxwin.

Positive 1289 pI have scoured Stack Overflow and the internet in general for steps leading to an answer, but have as of yet been unsuccessful.  My main goal is to use ASP scripts with MS SQL databases on my standalone Win7 PC, but the short term goal is to be able to configure an ODBC User or File DSN connection that tests successfully in the ODBC Data Source Administrator.p  pI have SQL Server 2012 installed and can successfully connect to the database engine from SQL Server Management Studio.p  pWhen I try to configure a DSN entry in ODBC, the error message reads p  blockquote   p[Microsoft][SQL Server Native Client 11.0]Named Pipes Provider Could not open a connection to SQL Server [53]. p blockquote  pAll attempts to test the data source lead to a  15second timeout with the TESTS FAILED message.p  pI have tried all of the usually recommended adjustments.

Positive 1289 pI have found many examples that read a SQL database, as using PowerShell on the net.p  pBut, I can not find any example, to read an unknown database with ODBC and powershell. The database handles SQL queries via ODBC I know the name of the ODBC connector DSN  Squid Star The database has no username and password ie the database is open Also knows the names of the various tables, that I would want to read. I want the ability to specify which fields to export with SQL queries such as SELECT  FROM OPERATORp  pThe result should be saved in a CSV file in UTF8 format and preferably with headers.p  hr  pIs it difficult to make an import, with certain fields to the same database via ODBC using PowerShellp  pI have no idea how to fix this, but I think that it should not be so difficult with PowerShellp  pJanp

Positive 1289 pBeginner here.p  pI have an application built in MFC Vicual C, compiled using VS2010. I have a DSN as an ODBC connection to a live Excel spreadsheet via Excel driver.p  pMy app queries a spreadsheet every second. If one cells value changes a result of a simple calculation involving other cells receiving a live data feed, the app prints the new value then goes back to querying for changes.p  pThe App works fine for a period of time, dutifully printing the changes in the cells value as new data arrives in the feed. Then, it invariably generates an errorp  pThe Microsoft Jet Engine could not find the object unknown Make sure the object exists and that you spell its name and the path name correctly.p  pThe file paths are all given in absolutes.p  pI surmise that the error is generated whenever the query happens to exactly coincide with the cells contents being updated. I can generate the exact same error message and behavior, always, instantly, by clicking on the surveyed cell and touching a key beginning to edit the cell, here by overtyping the cell formula.p  pAn Afx error dialog runs. If I OK and select the excel file, the application goes back and runs, until a new same error. But if I select Cancel the application exits. p  pIf I comment out my own error catch, this dialog still appears.p  pI would like the application to run headless and merely retry to connect with the database. p  pIs there any way I can override herep  pI realize Excel is not amenable to concurrent multiuser access. But I dont need to have concurrent access I dont care to see the cell when something else is changing it. I simply want to wait and retry.p  pApologies in advance for asking about dinosaur bonetech here. The fact I need to query live data has led me by trialanderror to ODBC libxl sees only the file data and formulas, rather than their values.p

Negative 1289 pI have a unique situation where I need to implement client certificate authentication over HTTPS between IE browser and IIS 6.  The browser and IIS are separated by a firewall that only allows the browser to connect to IIS on the SSL port.p  pWe have an internal certificate server on the same network as IIS.  Ive generated an SSL server cert for IIS and that is installed.  I configured IIS to only allow SSL, require client certificates.p  pThe limitation here is the browser machine is on a disconnected network, so I cant go to the CAs a hrefhttpcaserverCertSrvhttpcaserverCertSrva URL and a hrefhttpwww.windowsecurity.comarticlesClientCertificateAuthenticationIIS6.htmlrequest a client certa like you normally would.p  pI figured if there were a way that I could generate a CSR against the Root CAs public key, I can copy it to the CA server to generate the client cert.  But, there appears to be no provision in IE or the Certificates MMC to do this.  The Certificates MMC seems to require a direct connection to the CA.p  pHas anyone solved this beforep  pFYI, All servers referenced run Windows Server 2003.p  pstrongUpdatestrong Thanks to Jonas Oberschweiber and Mark Sutton for pointing out the CertReq.exe command line tool.  Using this, Ive generated a CSR, and consequently a client certificate that installs successfully.  However, IE is apparently not sending this client cert when accessing the IIS server in question it still generates a 403.7 Forbidden SSL client certificate is required.  I suspect that the reason is that the Subject field of the client cert does not match the user id of the account running IE, thus perhaps not sending a mismatching client cert.  The Subject matches that of the user I used to submit the CSR and generate the client cert on the other end of the firewall.p  pDoes the Subject field matter  Is there something else I need to do to enable IE to send this certp

Negative 1289 pShort background We are just starting to migratereimplement an ERP system to Java with Hibernate, targeting a concurrent user count of 50100 users using the system. We use MS SQL Server as database server, which is good enough for this loads.p  pNow, the old system doesnt use any transactions at all and relies for critical parts e.g. stock changes on setting manual locks using flags and releasing them. Thats something like manual transaction management. But there are sometimes problems with data inconsistency. In the new system we would like to use transactions to wipe out these problems.p  pNow the question What would be a goodreasonable strongdefaultstrong transaction isolation level to use for an ERP system, given a usage of about 85 OLTP and 15 OLAP Or should I always decide on a per task basis, which transaction level to usep  pAnd as a reminder the four transaction isolation levels READ UNCOMMITTED, READ COMMITTED, REPEATABLE READ, SERIALIZABLEp

Negative 1289 pI have recently read about how cursors should be avoided. Well, I would like to know if my usage of them is appropriate.p  pI am creating a scripting engine that will work onlineembedded in a page, serverside This scripting engine will be used by advanced end users of this product. The product works very heavily with the database however, and the scripting language is Clike, but simplified to where it also resembles PHP. For databases I basically want a syntax like this, as it is the most consistent syntax creatable within the language without the end user having to hand write SQL codeif we are going to make them do that, why cant they just skip the scripting engine as its there to make life simpler. The syntax is something like thisp  precodedeclare DataSet datatablename,OtherIDoid Datasetstring tablename,string whereclauseaddon data[field1]the data of field...  data.Next   data[field1]The data of the next row data[10][field1]The data of the 10th row codepre  pI control this internally by creating a global cursor for each DataSet I only use 1 connection in the application and then letting the global cursor keep track of the current row positionits a SCROLL and UPDATE cursor also. This makes my life much simpler as otherwise I would be forced to write my own SQL controls to combat .Nets sucky DataReader. p  pIs this usage of cursors an OK one Note that the page with these scripts will not be world wide accessible, its only for clientsso probably only like 310 users at once.p  pDoes anyone see a better method of keeping track of the current variable location as these are able to address tables of unknown schema p  pAlso, would I have any problems with concurrency using cursors like this My docs say cursors are global to the connection, and each page request makes a new connection on the spot, so users arent sharing connectionsp

Negative 1289 pI anticipate this is going to be a very broad question however I shall endevour to be as concise as possible without divulging too much project critical information. p  pFor quite some time I have been working a Content Management System. However, its vastly different to many CMSs available because of the way it handles the dispatch of requests over a server pool and incorporates its own Template Engine which I developed speciffically with flexibility and ease of use in mind. p  pAny way, this is completed and Im happy.p  pLooking over my product, Im seeing lots of practical applications for such a product. However for my target audience to be reached I need to expand on several of the core features which I currently offer.p  pNamely, I want to provide a solid document management system and include sharing and versioning of documents to enable businesses to pretty much use the product as an Enterprise Content Management Solution. p  pI am trying to find if there are first any plug in document control solutions available on licence. After researching SharePoint I can see that its not really the plug in type of thing Im looking for as I would need to take a massive step BACK to refactor lots of the site. p  pThe site is coded in PHP and runs several Java apps in the back end also currently so codelanguage divergence is not an issue. I run accross a mySQL database currently however can support again other types of RDMS. p  pIf you have created a website, which creates websites, how would you handle the additional features that a ECM demands. p

Negative 1289 pIn Silverlight, I call my Silverlightenabled WCF service asynchronously to retrieve, say, a list of values for a combobox. On the server, I cache these values for performance.

Negative 1289 pPHPs pcntlfork function is supposed to fork a process just as the standard fork function in C.br But I was wondering if this function really forks the process or if it emulates that behavior in a different way.br If it really forks the process then its clear which process that is one of Apaches child processes.br Thats OK as long as Apache is using the prefork MPM i.e. one process per request.br But what does happen if Apache is using the worker MPMbr When the worker MPM is being used, every Apache child process contains many threads, each one handling a different HTTP request.

Negative 1289 pIts been a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions2063841interfacesorattributesfortaggingclassesdiscussed before on Stack Overflowa that we should prefer attributes to a hrefhttpen.wikipedia.orgwikiMarkerinterfacepatternmarker interfacesa interfaces without any members. a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibraryms229022.aspxInterface Design article on MSDNa asserts this recommendation toop  blockquote   h3Avoid using marker interfaces interfaces with no members.h3      pCustom attributes provide a way to mark a type. For more information about custom attributes, see Writing Custom Attributes. Custom attributes are preferred when you can defer checking for the attribute until the code is executing. If your scenario requires compiletime checking, you cannot comply with this guideline.p blockquote  pTheres even an a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibraryms18212828VS.8029.aspxFxCop rulea to enforce this recommendationp  blockquote   h3Avoid empty interfacesh3      pInterfaces define members that provide a behavior or usage contract. The functionality described by the interface can be adopted by any type, regardless of where the type appears in the inheritance hierarchy. A type implements an interface by providing implementations for the interfaces members. An empty interface does not define any members, and as such, does not define a contract that can be implemented.  p      pIf your design includes empty interfaces that types are expected to implement, you are probably using an interface as a marker, or a way of identifying a group of types. If this identification will occur at runtime, the correct way to accomplish this is to use a custom attribute. Use the presence or absence of the attribute, or the attributes properties, to identify the target types. If the identification must occur at compile time, then using an empty interface is acceptable.p blockquote  pThe article states only one reason that you might ignore the warning when you need compile time identification for types. This is consistent with the Interface Design article.p  blockquote   pIt is safe to exclude a warning from this rule if the interface is used to identify a set of types at compiletime.p blockquote  pHere comes the actual question Microsoft didnt conform to their own recommendation in the design of the Framework Class Library at least in a couple cases a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibrarysystem.web.sessionstate.irequiressessionstate.aspxIRequiresSessionState interfacea and a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibrarysystem.web.sessionstate.ireadonlysessionstate.aspxIReadOnlySessionState interfacea. These interfaces are used by the ASP.NET framework to check whether it should enable session state for a specific handler or not. Obviously, its not used for compile time identification of types. Why they didnt do that I can think of two potential reasonsp  ol lipMicrooptimization Checking whether an object implements an interface codeobj is IReadOnlySessionStatecode is faster than using reflection to check for an attribute codetype.IsDefinedtypeofSessionStateAttribute, truecode. The difference is negligible most of the time but it might actually matter for a performancecritical code path in the ASP.NET runtime. However, there are workarounds they could have used like caching the result for each handler type. The interesting thing is that ASMX Web services which are subject to similar performance characteristics actually use the a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibrarysystem.web.services.webmethodattribute.enablesession.aspxcodeEnableSessioncode propertya of the a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibrarysystem.web.services.webmethodattribute.aspxcodeWebMethodcode attributea for this purpose. pli lipImplementing interfaces are potentially more likely to be supported than decorating types with attributes by thirdparty .NET languages. Since ASP.NET is designed to be language agnostic, and ASP.NET generates code for types possibly in a thirdparty language with the help of a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibraryy2k85ax6.aspxCodeDoma that implement the said interfaces based on the codeEnableSessionStatecode attribute of the a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibraryydy4x04a.aspxcodelt Page gtcode directivea, it might make more sense to use interfaces instead of attributes.pli ol  pstrongWhat are the persuasive reasons to use marker interfaces instead of attributesstrongp  pIs this simply a premature optimization or a tiny mistake in the framework design Do they think a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions2063841interfacesorattributesfortaggingclasses20638562063856reflection is a big monster with red eyesa Thoughtsp

The Queue documentation is nice and has helped me write cleaner code since the get function blocks cool.

Negative 1289 pI am relatively new to the Silverlight experience and am trying to create a MVVM app with a DomainService that returns POCOs as the models. I have a UserControl that has a TreeView with the ItemsSource set to bind to an ObservableCollection of a type that has an ObservableCollection as one of its properties, and that collection is of a type that has a property of ObservableCollection. So Im using the HierarchicalDataTemplate as the ItemTemplate of the TreeView with TextBlocks to render the Name property of each item. I will include some code below.p  pSo the classes would be something like thisp  precodepublic class A      public int ID  get set      public string Name  get set      public ObservableCollectionltBgt Bs  get set    public class B      public int ID  get set      public string Name  get set      public ObservableCollectionltCgt Cs  get set    public class C      public int ID  get set      public string Name  get set   codepre  pBasically, my collections are getting populated from a DataRepository with a method that gets lists of A,B, and C. Adds each instance appropriately with LINQ through foreach loops. And returns a List. The method works correctly as I have called it from the default.aspx.cs and stepped through to confirm that all data is correctly added. p  pBut my problem is that when it is rendered on the screen, none of the collections are correct. For instance, the first item of As child collection of B should have a count of over 4000 and yet none are shown. And yet, the first item of B that is supposed to be in the collection Bs of the first A is shown for the second item of A.p  pexample of what it should bep  ul lipa1p  ul lib1.1 ul lic1.1.1li lic1.1.2li lic1.1.3li ulli lib1.2 ul lic1.2.1li lic1.2.2li ulli ulli lipa2p  ul lib2.4 ul lic2.4.1li lic2.4.2li lic2.4.3li ulli ulli lipa3p  ul lib3.6 ul lic3.6.1li lic3.6.2li lic3.6.3li ulli ulli lipa4p  ul lib4.8 ul lic4.8.1li lic4.8.2li lic4.8.3li ulli ulli ul  pexample of what it is showingp  ul lia1li lia2 ul lib2.2 ul lic2.2.2li ulli ulli lia3li lia4 ul lib4.4 ul lic4.4.4li ulli ulli ul  pAfter some investigation, the only pattern that I see is that the hierarchy is based on the IDs being the same.p  pHere are the code samplesp  pthe DataContext is set by a UserControl Resource  p  precodeltsdkTreeView ItemsSourceBinding PathAs gt  ltsdkTreeView.ItemTemplategt     ltsdkHierarchicalDataTemplate ItemsSourceBinding PathBsgt    ltTextBlock TextBinding PathName gt    ltsdkHierarchicalDataTemplate.ItemTemplategt     ltsdkHierarchicalDataTemplate ItemsSourceBinding PathCsgt      ltTextBlock TextBinding PathName gt      ltsdkHierarchicalDataTemplate.ItemTemplategt       ltsdkHierarchicalDataTemplate ItemsSourceBindinggt        ltTextBlock TextBinding PathName gt       ltsdkHierarchicalDataTemplategt      ltsdkHierarchicalDataTemplate.ItemTemplategt     ltsdkHierarchicalDataTemplategt    ltsdkHierarchicalDataTemplate.ItemTemplategt   ltsdkHierarchicalDataTemplategt  ltsdkTreeView.ItemTemplategt ltsdkTreeViewgt codepre  pstrongViewModelstrongp  precodepublic class myViewModel      private myDomainContext context  new myDomainContext      public ObservableCollectionltAgt As              get                      LoadOperationltAgt loadOp  context.Loadcontext.GetAsQuery             return new ObservableCollectionltAgtloadOp.Entities                codepre  pI apologize about the length of this question, I was hoping to not be so vague and to get some helpful advise.

Negative 1289 pIm using Rails 2.3.8 and acceptsnestedattributesfor.p  pI have a simple category object which uses awesomenestedset to allow nested categories.p  pFor each category I would like a unique field called code.  This would be unique for the category per level.  Meaning parent categories will all have unique codes and sub categories will be unique within their own parent category.p  pEG p  precodecode name 1    cat1    1 sub cat 1 2    cat2    1 sub cat 1    2 sub cat 2 3    cat3    1 sub1 codepre  pThis works without the validation process but when I try and use something like validatesuniquenessof code, scope  parentidp  pThat will not work because the parent has not been saved yet.p  pHere is my modelp  precodeclass Category lt ActiveRecordBase   actsasnestedset   acceptsnestedattributesfor children, rejectif gt lambda  a a[name].blank , allowdestroy gt true    defaultscope order gt lft    validatespresenceof code, name, ischild   validatesuniquenessof code, scope gt parentid end codepre  pI have thought of a different way to do this and its very close to working, problem is I cannot check for uniqueness between child categories.  p  pIn this second example Ive embedded a hidden field in the form called ischild to flag if the item is a sub category or not.  Here is my example of this modelp  precodeclass Category lt ActiveRecordBase   actsasnestedset   acceptsnestedattributesfor children, rejectif gt lambda  a a[name].blank , allowdestroy gt true    defaultscope order gt lft    validatespresenceof code, name, ischild   validatesuniquenessof code, scope gt parentid   validate hasuniquecode    attraccessor ischild     private    def hasuniquecode      if self.ischild  1        Check here if the code has already been taken this will only work for         updating existing children.     else         Check code relating to other parents       result  Category.findbycodeself.code, conditions gt  parentid gt nil        if result.nil         true       else         errors.addcode, Duplicate found         false       end     end   end end codepre  pThis is very close.  If there was a way to detect duplicate codes in the rejectif syntax under acceptsnestedattributesfor then I would be there.  This all seems over complicated though and would like suggestions to make it easier.  We would like to keep adding categories and sub categories in the one form as it speeds up data entry.p  pstrongUpdatestrong Maybe I should be using build or beforesave.p

Negative 1289 pFirst of all, I do not want to start a religious war here, and pardon me for telling you a little story first.p  pI originally chose emacs as my editor of choice during the time when I was able to make a choice. As an intern I was forced to use Vi for a small software shop where we are required to ssh to the servers not to mention a very slow connection and edit code from there because were not allowed to have local copies of the source code. During that time, I was an Emacs uber noob who doesnt know about tramp. I didnt even know that I could start a shell at Emacs, so I gave Vi a try just to see whats in it for me.p  pAt first, it felt like being forced to wear clothes I dont like, but time passed by and I came to like Vim. Two years of vim and still counting has been very productive learning experience for me. My current setup involves xmonad  a window manager, gnu screen  for fast shell switching, firefox with vimperator, and of course, vim. At work, I do my coding stuff using VimEclim because all my other coworkers use Eclipse  and I have to conform somewhat. In my workplace, Im regarded as the guy who knows his way around Vim but still, I secretly use Emacs at home.p  pI want to get back up to speed in Emacs, but in order for me to do that, I must use it for what Im currently doing at work because I spend most of my time there. VimEclim really helped me a lot with java stuff code completion, imports, etc. and Im thinking of using its Emacs port, but Im also trying out other alternatives that would not require me to have an eclipse process running in the background. Basically, I want something with code completion and onsave compile like what EclipseEclim has. Is jdeemalabar mode enough to do this Also, Im coding Android stuff and I want Emacs to know where the Android libraries are, since most of the fundamental ones arent usually imported as normal. p

Negative 1289 pImplicit conversion can be really useful when types are semantically equivalent. For example, imagine two libraries that implement a type identically, but in different namespaces. Or just a type that is mostly identical, except for some semanticsugar here and there. Now you cannot pass one type into a function in one of those libraries that was designed to use the other, unless that function is a template. If its not, you have to somehow convert one type into the other. This should be trivial or otherwise the types are not so identical afterall but calling the conversion explicitly bloats your code with mostly meaningless functioncalls. While such conversion functions might actually copy some values around, they essentially do nothing from a highlevel programmers pointofview.p  pImplicit conversion constructors and operators could obviously help, but they introduce coupling, so that one of those types has to know about the other. Usually, at least when dealing with libraries, that is not the case, because the presence of one of those types makes the other one redundant. Also, you cannot always change libraries.p  pNow I see two options on how to make implicit conversion work in usercode p  ol lipThe first would be to provide a proxytype, that implements conversionoperators and conversionconstructors and assignments for all the involved types, and always use that.pli lipThe second requires a minimal change to the libraries, but allows great flexibility  Add a conversionconstructor for each involved type that can be externally optionally enabled.pli ol  pFor example, for a type codeAcode add a constructorp  precodetemplate ltclass Tgt A   const Tamp src,   typename boostenableifltconversionenabledltT,Agtgttype ignore0     this  convertsrc  codepre  pand a template p  precodetemplate ltclass X, class Ygt struct conversionenabled  public boostmplfalse  codepre  pthat disables the implicit conversion by default.p  pThen to enable conversion between two types, specialize the templatep  precodetemplate ltgt struct conversionenabledltOtherA, Agt  public boostmpltrue  codepre  pand implement a codeconvertcode function that can be found through ADL.p  pI would personally prefer to use the second variant, unless there are strong arguments against it.p  pNow to the actual questions Whats the preferred way to associate types for implicit conversion Are my suggestions good ideas Are there any downsides to either approach Is allowing conversions like that dangerous Should library implementers ingeneral supply the second method when its likely that their type will be replicated in software they are most likely beeing used with Im thinking of 3drendering middleware here, where most of those packages implement a 3D vector.p

Negative 1289 pIve heard the phrase fat model, thin controller and believe I understand its implications. While working through the a hrefhttpframework.zend.commanualenlearning.quickstart.createmodel.html relnofollowZend Quickstart Guidea I have come across the Table Data Gateway pattern.p  pIt seems to me that this design pattern is advocating a fourth component to the MVC stack. It is moving away from a Fat Model to thin model, thin controller and fat TableDataGateway. From my understanding of this design pattern, the Model becomes very little more than a storage mechanism for the data that the TableDataGateway stuffs into it.p  pI understand the advantages of the Table Data Gateway design pattern with abstracting our data source, my question isnt about the design pattern, but rather how it fits into the MVC stack.p  pemP.S.

Negative 1289 pWe have a decentsized development team with a few concurrent projects being developed on the same code line. Sometimes we add migrations that are okay to run in development environment but should not be run in prod for a few months due to that projects release schedule. This has caused us to stick with Rails original numbered migrations, rather than timestamped, since we can easily migrate up to a certain magic number and have all of the prod migrations after this magic number.p  pIt totally feels like were doing it wrong. We still have the issue of developers creating the same numbered migration. We cant simply keep a project on a branch for a while because the branch will diverge from trunk.p  pIs there a method or tool that anyones encountered that deals with migration issues like this p
Negative 1289 pI have a build system where many of the components are the exact same, so Ive been changing it to use import on a common file for most build tasks. Then the build system also needs to build any modules that its dependent on. So I have roughly...p  precodecommon.xml project1.xml    import common.xml project2.xml    include project1.xml    import common.xml codepre  pTheres a target named build in common.xml. I want project2 to be able to include project1 and use extensionpoint to place a dependency on the build target. But for some reason, it doesnt recognize that project1 has a build target. If I change it to depend on a target that is defined in project1.xml, then its fine. But I need to be able to specify a target thats in common.xml.p  pIs there anyway to do thisp  pNo antcontrib. The project used to use that, but Im trying to get rid of it so we dont have horrible, procedural, build system code. The project has many cases of dependencies that look like a diamond and a proper dependency graph one that ant generates automatically would help greatly.p  pSo I created a few simple files to illustrate my problem.p  precodeltproject nametop defaultbuildgt   ltinclude filemid.xml asmid gt   lttarget namebuildgt     ltantcall targetmid.build gt   lttargetgt ltprojectgt  ltproject namemid defaultbuildgt   lt lttarget namebuildgt gt   lt   ltecho messagebuild mid gt gt   lt lttargetgt gt   ltimport filecommon.xml gt ltprojectgt  ltproject namecommongt   lttarget namebuildgt     ltecho messagebuild common gt   lttargetgt ltprojectgt codepre  pThis fails. top.xml cant find mid.build. When I run ant p to list the targets, it shows build and common.build. So I tried adding in  to the mid.xml build file and I got it to build correctly. The only problem now is that if I uncomment the XML above for mid to define its own build step, it get overwritten by the import and ignored. So it ends up becoming [build, common.build] instead of [build, mid.build].p

Negative 1289 pId like to find a way to log every error that forces the python interpreter to quit to be saved to a file as well as being printed to the screen.  The reason I would like to do this is that I want to keep stats on the types of errors I make while writing code, with an eye towards finding ways to avoid mistakes I make commonly in the future.p  pIve been attempting to do this by writing a wrapper for the python interpreter using the subprocess module.  Basically, it runs the python interpreter, captures any output, parse and saves it to a file, prints the output, and use matplotlib to make some summary figures.  However, Im having a problem getting output from my wrapper script in real time.  For example, if the script Im running isp  precodeimport os   import time  for x in range10       print testing       time.sleep10   codepre  pand Im using subprocess.Popen with p.communicate, the wrapper will wait 100 seconds, and then print all of the output.  Id like the wrapper to be as invisible as possible  ideally in this case it would print testing once every ten seconds.p  pIf someone could point me towards a good way of doing this, Id greatly appreciate it.p  pThanksp

Negative 1289 pIn MVC its like codehttpwww.yourdomain.comsampleControllersampleActioncode and if you call just codesampleControllercode then codesampleControllerindexActioncode and if you just call  then codeindexControllerindexActioncode fires.p  pOf course there are exceptions but thats more or less the convention.p  pZend has something smilir.

But is it the right one Is there a convention to uniquely adress the right action in the right controllerp  pMy first idea was to guess as little as possible.p  pSo I first check if the url is directly matched to an action. p  pAnd if there is a controllermodule called the same with an index action, it just can not fire if a match on a higher level is present.p  pIf this is not the case I see whether the url directly matches a controller and append IndexAction.p  pIf this is not the case too I look for a module and guess IndexController and IndexAction and if this is not the case I look for an module called index.p  pBut i would like to avoid this ifelse stuff and the file system accesses.

Or is there even one I could not find any examplesp  pOr does something like calling IndexAction if none is specified just not done but every short url has to be specified in seperate routing logicp  pOr have I completely mis understood the concept of HMVCPACp  pFYI I included the php tag because I am doing my framework in php and want to know about the conventions in php.

Negative 1289 pI maintain a large document archive and I often use bit fields to record the status of my documents during processing or when validating them. My legacy code simply uses static int constants such asp  precodestatic int DOCUMENTSTATUSNOSTATE  0 static int DOCUMENTSTATUSOK  1 static int DOCUMENTSTATUSNOTIFFILE  2 static int DOCUMENTSTATUSNOPDFFILE  4 codepre  pThis makes it pretty easy to indicate the state a document is in, by setting the appropriate flags.

Negative 1289 pI am desperate to find out how to architect my Entity Framework 4 code first application.p  pI have one VS project that will handle access to my data.  Its a MEFExported Part code[MyData]code, based on an Interface code[IDataExport]code.  That project has my EF classes customer, order, etc, the context initializer, etc and all that already works like a dream.p  pI have one VS project that has my interfaces all my interfaces.  All projects have a reference to this Interface project.p  pI have one VS project that does all my logging.  It is also a MEFExported Part code[MyLog]code, based on an interface code[ILogging]code.  That class really just writes to the Console.p  pI have Three VS projects that we will call Parts in MEF terms.  They are plugins.  They need data to work customers, orders, etc.  Actually, they need data as an Input from three different tables, all at once.p  pI have one project that is the Host application.  It is currently running as a console application but will soon be converted to a Windows Service.p  pI hope that gave you a good idea of the architecture that is in place.  Now I am having troubles trying to figure out how to do my data access correctly.  p  pWhen the host needs data to pass to the plugins, it needs to get data from 3 different tables.  Actually, the way it is setup with EF, the three tables will be retrieved at once.  How do I pass that data to the plugin, when the plugin was instantiated by MEF  Can PlugIns raise events to interact with the Host application p  pIn addition, as the plugins run, data in the tables will need to be updated.  How do I keep my data in the database updated three layers up  The Host can call the PlugIn, but the Plugin doesnt have a way to call the Host.  Only the code[MyData]code project has access to the Database.p  pBased on the scenario that I described, could someone please tell me how to best architect this applicationp  pAdding further to my confusion, some sample code shows the calling application in this case the host, starting brand new Models for each search call to the database. e.g.p  precodepublic ListltCustomergt FindCustomerListstring companyName      return new CustomerManager.FindCustomerListcompanyName    public ListltCustomergt FindCustomerListstring companyName      var q  from c in context.Customers             where c.CompanyName.StartsWithcompanyName             select c     return q.ToList  codepre  hr  pBelow are my three tables.

Negative 1289 pSo I have an application running on Android 2.2 on a HTC desire. When the user presses the menu key, my menus silkily slide in from top and bottom. This works just great. Or so I thought. It turns out that even when the ImageButtons are off screen and invisible, the hitboxes of the places where they were before I moved them out of sight activate the buttons. p  pI have triedp  precodetopslideoutmenu.forceLayout topslideoutmenu.recomputeViewAttributesmeasure topslideoutmenu.computeScroll codepre  pNo difference. At a guess it may be because I am moving the parent container object using the animation rather than the buttons themselves. I can only hypothesise that there is a bug that does not update the child hitboxes.  This bug seems to also affect subsequent animations I apply to the button. I have a animation I run on a button that I have previously moved using a different animation. This second animation shrinks then grows the button to give the impression of a click. Only half of the button is redrawn, as that is the half contained within the area of the origional button location. p  pSo the question is, has anyone run into this Is there anything to try other than moving all the buttons individually which would get rather tiresomep  pId appreciate any ideas at this point p  pThanksp
Negative 1289 pFirst of all, I am using Postgres 9.1.p  pI have a table named filepaths and other tables that have rows that point to the id of their corresponding filepaths.  Is there a common design approach for reference counting the filepaths so that when other rows are dropped and there are no longer any references to a particular filepath row, it can be dropped as well  p  pExamplep  precode    [filepaths]     1  cwindowssystem32test.exe     2  cwindowscalc.exe      [events20110830]     [1][timestamp][other data] [ filepaths  1]     [2][timestamp][other data] [ filepaths  2]      [events20110831]     [1][timestamp][other data] [ filepaths  1] codepre  pSo I will be storing data in tables to partition it, and I want to delete old tables when they are older than say 30 days will still have them archived.  In the above example, lets assume there are only those two events tables.  If I delete the 20110830, I would desire a way to know that nothing is pointing to filepaths 2 and therefore remove it, but know that a row is still pointing to filepaths 1 and therefore retain it.p  pAny thoughts, suggestions, etc I believe some of the strategies I have read, at least for postgres and triggers, still have race conditions about which thread got a lock first on the primary key column and other related issues.p  pThanksp

Negative 1289 ol liMy window controller subclass is the nibs owner.li liI instantiate my array controller, in code, in my document subclass. Both the document and window controller use it in code.li liI bind table columns like this strongFile Owner  document.arrayController.arrangedObjects.attributeNamestrong.li liThe table view does not display any rows.li liNeither the window controller nor document class receive codeaddObservercode messages related to the table view.li ol  pObviously Im not binding to this array controller correctly. I think Im missing something fundamental about how table view columns bind to arrays.p  pThis problem came about during some refactoring. I used to instantiate the array controller in the nib. The document was the file owner, and had an outlet for the array controller. The bindings looked like strongMy Array Controller  arrangedObjects  attributeNamestrong. Everything worked fine.p  pSince the document handles inserting objects through the array controller, I didnt think the window controller should be responsible for creating it. The window controller is the new nib owner, so I removed it from the nib. I now create it in code in codemakeWindowControllerscode. I asked this a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions7734701ismakewindowcontrollersthecorrectplacetoinitializeannspersistentdocumentrelated question about initializationa.p  pWhile debugging this Ive discovered something else. If the window controller is the table views data source and I implement codenumberOfRowsInDataSourcecodep  precodereturn [[self.document.arrayController arrangedObjects] count] codepre  pthe table view calls it, sends codeaddObservercode messages for all the columns, and actually loads values for each cell using the bindings. But when loading a value for a given cell, instead of loading the attribute value for the nth object in codearrangedObjectscode, it loads attribute values emfor the entire column of objectsem. It passes these arrays to value transformers which cant handle them correctly and displays the arrays codedescriptioncode in the text cells in which they do not fit.p  pWhen the window controller is the table views data source but columns use bindings, the table view should ignore the result of the codenumberOfRowsInTableViewcode, or perhaps shouldnt call it at all. Responding to the selector with codereturn 0code merely avoids a runtime error. sThe data source is only set in the first place to implement tool tips for cells.s And again, all this used to work fine when I created the array controller in the nib.p  pSome thoughtsp  ol liIs it even possible to use IB to bind table columns to an array controller thats owned by another objectli liDo I need to put the array controller back in the nib, and have the window controller share it with the document instance That sounds like horrible design.li liShould I have two array controllers, one for the window controller and another for the documentli ol  hr  pstrongAddedstrongp  pThe reason I used a table view data source along with bindings is to implement draganddrop reordering using these methodsp  ul licodetableViewwriteRowsWithIndexestoPasteboardcodeli licodetableViewvalidateDropproposedRowproposedDropOperationcodeli licodetableViewacceptDroprowdropOperationcodeli ul

If the foreignkey does not support null values, a new relationship must be defined, the foreignkey property must be assigned another nonnull value, or the unrelated object must be deleted.p  pThere are bunch posts explained it, but Im stuck because the example is many explained without repository pattern or using ObjectContext.p  phere is some my code at repository base and way I use it.p  precode public abstract class RepositoryBaseltTgt  IRepositoryltTgt where T  class      private readonly DbContext context     private readonly IDbSetltTgt dbset      protected RepositoryBaseDbContext dbContext              context  dbContext         dbset  context.SetltTgt           public void DeleteT entity              dbset.Removeentity         Commit           private void Commit              try                      context.SaveChanges                  catch DbEntityValidationException dbEx                      var exceptionMessage  new StringBuilder             foreach var validationErrors in dbEx.EntityValidationErrors                              foreach var validationError in validationErrors.ValidationErrors                                      exceptionMessage.AppendFormatProperty 0 Error 1, validationError.PropertyName,                                                validationError.ErrorMessage                                            throw so that we see the exception right away when we develop               codepre  pand the service calls it p  precodepublic class UserService  IUserService      private readonly IUserRepository userRepository      public UserServiceIUserRepository userRepository              userRepository  userRepository           public void DeleteUserUser user                          userRepository.Deleteuser            public void DeleteUserint userId              var user  userRepository.GetByIduserId         DeleteUseruser       codepre  pI mean, can we just call delete service from repository and all the child object is automatically deleteor if I have to delete the child entity one by one, how I could do that and I dont wanna modify the database with using cascade because when I changed model and generate database from model it will broken all.p  pUPDATE  here is the modelp  precodepublic partial class User      public User              this.EAConnections  new HashSetltEAConnectiongt         this.UserRepositoryRoles  new HashSetltUserLinkRepositoryRolegt           public int UserId  get set      public string UserName  get set       public virtual ICollectionltEAConnectiongt EAConnections  get set      public virtual ICollectionltUserLinkRepositoryRolegt UserRepositoryRoles  get set    public partial class UserLinkRepositoryRole      public int UserRepositoryRoleId  get set      public int UserId  get set      public int RepositoryRoleId  get set      public int EAConnectionId  get set       public virtual User User  get set      public virtual RepositoryRole RepositoryRole  get set      public virtual EAConnection EAConnection  get set   codepre  pThank you in advancep

Negative 1289 pI feel like using Dependency Injection is changing the way I write my object oriented code. For instance, below is what I would do without DIp  precodeInterface DataAdapter SqliteDataAdapter implements DataAdapter XMLDataAdapter    implements DataAdapter OracleDataAdapter implements DataAdapter   Initialization DataAdapter adapter  new SqliteDataAdapter DataAdapter adapter  new XMLDataAdapter DataAdapter adapter  new OracleDataAdapter codepre  pbut using DI my code structure would bep  precodeInterface DataAdapter SqliteDataAdapter implements ISqliteDataAdapter,  DataAdapter XMLDataAdapter    implements IXMLDataAdapter, DataAdapter OracleDataAdapter implements IOracleDataAdapter, DataAdapter   Initialization ISqliteDataAdapter adapter  new SqliteDataAdapter IXMLDataAdapter    adapter  new XMLDataAdapter IOracleDataAdapter adapter  new OracleDataAdapter codepre  pThe reason for this change is that in my module I can strongbind 1 interface to 1 classstrong.

Negative 1289 pI have an application that handles licence registrations for various product. Im currently refactoring into a basic MVC framework not using any of the big ones yet. We have various basic scenarios e.g. someone can make a cc purchase of a product via the website. This fires the create customer, create order, create licence etc objects basically just db inserts using beans and gateways as I think that is the standard.p  pAnyway, to handle all this Im calling a purchaseService.cfc, which validates the various business rules and wraps the persistencedb layer processes together. That seems to work fine and I thought having a purchaseService cfc contained that process well. p  pNow we need another, similar process where a key can be registered to achieve the same as above. i.e. provide a licence to the customer. obviously there will be differing rules. p  pAs far as naming conventions go, are there any rules to help decide what to call these service wrapper type cfcs. Most of the examples I see are per object, e.g. the user object has a userGateway and userService and dont give examples of cases where we need a wrapper to call multiple objects. Is what Ive done ok convention wise using a purchaseService object I was going to call it CustomerlicenceOrder.cfc based on the other objects it was dependent on. What will I do with the new requirement Perhaps create another service object Called PurchaseByKeyService Doesnt sound right to me. I have read so much on OO and MVC etc etc but the more I read the more questions I have p  pThanksp
Negative 1289 pI am modifying an application that plays audio data to write the data to a file instead. As it is currently implemented, a byte array is filled dynamically, and the contents of this buffer are written to a SourceDataLine each time it is filled. I basically want to write that buffer out to a file in a specified format.p  pI have read through a hrefhttpdocs.oracle.comjavasetutorialsoundconverters.html relnofollowthis official tutoriala and came across this code snipped for writing audio data to a filep  precodeFile fileOut  new FilesomeNewPathName AudioFileFormat.Type fileType  fileFormat.getType if AudioSystem.isFileTypeSupportedfileType,      audioInputStream    AudioSystem.writeaudioInputStream, fileType, fileOut  codepre  pI see from the API documentation that I can construct an AudioInputStream using a TargetDataLine, however in my case I have a SourceDataLine. I dont know how to get the data from my byte array into the TargetDataLine since it implements the read method instead of write. Other uses of the AudioInputStream in that and other documentation treat it as a way of reading emfromem a file, so Im a little confused by its use with AudioSystem.write. p  pSo, how can I get the data from a SourceDataLine, or from the buffer directly, into a TargetDataLine or AudioInputStream so that it can be written out to a filep

Negative 1289 pMy iPhone app uses core data and things are fine for most part. But here is a problem after a certain amount of data, it stalls at first time execution where core data entities must be loaded.p  pSome experimenting showed that things are OK up to a certain amount of data loaded in Core Data at start. If I go over a critical amount the installation starts failing. The bigger the amount of data for start, the higher the probability that it fails.p  pBy making separate tests I made sure the data themselves are not faulty. I also can say this problem does not appear in the simulator. It also does not happen when I connect the debugger to the device.p  pIt looks like too much data loaded in core data in a short amount of time creates some kind of overload. Is that true Any idea on a possible solutionp  pAt this point I made up a partial solution using a UIActionSheet object to kill some time asking the user to push a button. But this is not very satisfactory, though for the time being it works.p  pAny comment or advice for a better way would be appreciated.p

Negative 1289 pI started a Process through java.lang.Runtimeexec, on Java 6, Linux, for which I only need the stdout. Unfortunately the program I run ffmpeg insists on cluttering up the stderr with progress information.

My suggestionsp  p1p  precodeffmpeg i .... .... 2gtdevnull codepre  pThis works, but means I have to execString in stead of execString[], which means I have to escape my parameters, for which there is no standard function in Java. I could build one, but prefer not.p  p2p  pUse the above ffmpeg command in a wrapper script, that redirects the output to devnull. Sounds ok, but having a bash script just for that seems overkill.p  p3p  pAttach the ErrorStream as well, start a thread that does nothing but read on the errorstream.

Negative 1289 pI am trying to use a spin button within my TreeView.

That is absolutely ridiculous, as there is no way the user will know that the cell is editable other than randomly clicking in it, especially since there are other values in the row that are not editable.p  pSo my first question is, how can I make those spin buttons always visible p  pstrongCould this be done with a custom CellRendererstrongp  pI would be thankful for an example of how to create my own, actually working, spin button cell renderer. Unfortunately, custom cell renderers are an undocumented mystery as almost anything in gtk  . And all you can find to them are examples that draw Cairo rectangles, etc. themselves. There must be an easier way where can you simply put any widget into that renderer, and listen to clicks, etc. and simply render the widget when the cell is rendered.p  pAn example for a custom CellRenderer that simply displays a button that can listen to clicks would also be fine as I could at least fake a SpinButton, by having three columns with a text, a Button and a Button.p
Negative 1289 pI have programmed a UIImageView that allows me to draw inside of it. It therefore tracks the users touches and records it. When used in a window it works great.p  pHowever, I have then added it as a subView of a UIScrollView which resides in a View Controller.

Negative 1289 pI am currently trying to understand the combination of Azure ACS with Claimsbased Auth and the option of using a custom STS and I am only slowly getting through the unfortunately few info sources. Before I spend more hours on this I would like to confirm if my plan is even possible. I have multiple azure roles webworker that are being accessed over the internet by both employees and customers. Additionally, employees access these roles and desktop apps from inside our local network. p  pUser data comes from two sources. Our azure app has user data about customers and employees, our local AD only from employees.p  pTo make the login experience as efficient and ergonomic as possible, when accessed via our local network, employees should be automatically authenticated Windows Integrated Auth on both the desktop app automatically because of Windows User Profile Context and on the azure apps hopefully wo login page. Customers, on the other hand, should enter their user credentials when accessing the azure app, but should not have to decide between different Credentialsources, they should just get the usernamepassword form. In other wordsp  ul liEmployee visits Azure app from local network  Autologin with Integrated Auth  AD datali liEmployee visits Azure app from internet  UsernamePassword formli liCustomer visits Azure app from internet  UsernamePassword formli ul  pWhile writing this question, two more came to mindp  p1 Is it even possible to autologin based on sourcecookiewizardry or would that require a manual user choice for selecting the CredentialSourcep  p2 If Azure ACS knows that AD account with Username X is the same as Azure App User Y, does it matter with which one logins Can the app access the same claimdata on either login routep

Negative 1289 pI have my code running on a Linux server.  I edit my code from my laptop which happens to be a Mac.  I use netatalk so that I can easily mount the code directory on my server from my laptop.  I recently started playing with Pyramid and SQLalchemy and I wanted to add unittest to my development practices.p  pOS X  Netatalk create a .AppleDouble subdirectory when I view any directory from the laptop.  Normally, this isnt a problem, I just ignore the .AppleDouble subdirectories.p  pThe moment I visit the directory Im running my tests from, OS X  netatalk add the .AppleDouble directory and in this directory, I can find files that have the exact same names as are present in the parent directory.  This is a problem because unittest recurses through all of the directories it find looking for a pattern of test.py and tries to import those files.  Which fails on any file in the .AppleDouble directory which contain icon data, desktop placement, and such.p  pI know that one option is not to use netatalk.  Id like to avoid that if possible.p  pLooking at the code in unittest specifically loader.py, it seems that the discovery of test cases happens in a function called discover and a related function findfiles.p  pI am looking for some thoughts on how to best override the discover and findfiles functions.  I dont have a lot of experience overriding the Python library and I dont see any obvious hooks.p  pIf it matters, I am using virtualenv and am pretty sure that if I put a copy of unittest in the virtualenv, it will override the system version.  That probably a good start, but Im interested in knowing what other people think of as a better solution rather than just a good one.p

Negative 1289 pI previously asked about a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions8936549constexproverloadingfunction overloading based on whether the arguments are codeconstexprcodea. Im trying to work around the disappointing answer to that question to make a smarter assert function. This is roughly what I am trying to dop  precodeinline void smartassert bool condition      if isconstexpr condition         staticassert condition, Error     else         assert condition  codepre  pBasically, the idea is that a compiletime check is always better than a runtime check if its possible to check at compile time. However, due to things like inlining and constant folding, I cant always know whether a compile time check is possible. This means that there may be cases where codeassert conditioncode compiles down to codeassertfalsecode and the code is just waiting for me to run it and execute that path before the I find out there is an error.p  pTherefore, if there were some way to check whether the condition is a constexpr due to inlining or other optimizations, I could call codestaticassertcode when possible, and fall back on a runtime assert otherwise. Fortunately, gcc has the intrinsic codebuiltinconstantp expcode, which returns true if codeexpcode is a constexpr. I dont know if other compilers have this intrinsic, but I was hoping that this would solve my problem. This is the code that I came up withp  precodeinclude ltcassertgt undef ISCONSTEXPR  if defined GNUC     define ISCONSTEXPRexp builtinconstantp exp else     define ISCONSTEXPRexp false endif  TODO Add other compilers  inline void smartassert bool const condition       staticassert ISCONSTEXPRcondition or condition, Error     if ISCONSTEXPRcondition         assert condition   undef ISCONSTEXPR codepre  pThe codestaticassertcode relies on the short circuit behavior of codeorcode. If codeISCONSTEXPRcode is true, then codestaticassertcode can be used, and the condition is codetrue or conditioncode, which is the same as just codeconditioncode. If codeISCONSTEXPRcode is false, then codestaticassertcode cannot be used, and the condition is codefalse or conditioncode, which is just the same as codetruecode and the codestaticassertcode is ignored. If the codestaticassertcode cannot be checked because codeconditioncode is not a constexpr, then I add a runtime codeassertcode to my code as a lastditch effort. However, this does not work, thanks to a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions8626055c11staticassertwithinconstexprfunction86264508626450not being able to use function arguments in a codestaticassertcodea, a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions9789913howtotellstaticassertthatconstexprfunctionargumentsareconsteven if the arguments are codeconstexprcodea.p  pIn particular, this is what happens if I try to compile with gccp  precode main.cpp int main       smartassert false     return 0  codepre  pcodeg main.cpp stdc0x O0codep  pEverything is fine, compiles normally. There is no inlining with no optimization, so codeISCONSTEXPRcode is false and the codestaticassertcode is ignored, so I just get a runtime codeassertcode statement that fails. However,p  precode[daviddaviddesktop test] g main.cpp stdc0x O1 In file included from main.cpp10 smartassert.hpp In function void smartassertbool smartassert.hpp123 error nonconstant condition for static assertion smartassert.hpp123 error condition is not a constant expression codepre  pAs soon as I turn on any optimizations and thus potentially allow codestaticassertcode to be triggered, it fails because I cannot use function arguments in the codestaticassertcode. Is there some way to work around this even if it means implementing my own codestaticassertcode I feel my C projects could theoretically benefit quite a bit from a smarter assert statement that catches errors as early as possible.p  pIt doesnt seem like making codesmartassertcode a functionlike macro will solve the problem in the general case. It will obviously make it work in this simple example, but codeconditioncode may have come from a function two levels up the call graph but still becomes known to the compiler as a codeconstexprcode due to inlining, which runs into the same problem of using a function parameter in a codestaticassertcode.p

Negative 1289 pIm have difficulty with a seeming simple problem. There are various C functions that I need to call from Python code. Currently, Im trying to do this through ctypes. Im having issues with a simple example implementation that Im using to ensure that everything works as intended before changing large chunks of existing code. The C functions take a few parameters, do various mathematical calculations, and then return a double value. This is the C file that Im using as a test.p  precodeinclude Python.h  double evaldouble args, int length, double rands, int randLength, int debug      double val1  args[0]     double val2  rands[0]     double ret  val1  val2     return ret  codepre  pIn my actual test function Im printing ival1i and ival2i to ensure theyre receiving values. Everything is fine on that end. The Python that calls this function is the following.p  precodetest  ctypes.CDLLhomemjjoyceDevC2M2LAquaticWavesModel.so rand  Random  args  [2] argsArr  ctypes.cdouble  lenargs argsArr[]  args  argsRand  [rand.random] argsRandArr  ctypes.cdouble  lenargsRand rgsRandArr[]  argsRand  result  test.evalargsArr, lenargsArr, argsRandArr, lenargsRandArr, 0 print result, result codepre  pWhen this prints the returned result, it usually dumps a large negative number. Its my assumption that I need to do some converting before Python can handle the value, but I cant find an answer for that for the life of me. Ive searched forever, but Im not certain if Im missing the obvious, or searching for the wrong information. p  pAlso, if I change the return type of the function to int, the calculations turn out correct and an int is returned and printed as expected. If I set it to double, the calculations are correct in the C code I print them to check, but Python doesnt like the returned result.p  pAny ideas what Im missingp

Negative 1289 pWell the title of this question might not actually reflect what I want, I couldnt think of anything better. Maybe I shouldve appended a emand then join two tables acquired this wayem to the end.p  pLets say I have this table.

When customer pays the payment, we change codepaidcode to code1code.p  precode  loanid  id  amount  paid          1   1    1000     1         1   2    1000     1         1   3    1000     0         2   4   10000     0         3   5   20000     1   codepre  pAnd now we need a report on loans. The output should look like thisp  precode  loanid   paid  remaining          1   2000       1000         2      0      10000         3  20000          0   codepre  pThe codepaidcode column is basically sum of all codeamountcode fields where pay  1. And the coderemainingcode is sum of the codeamountcode rows for which pay  0. They should be grouped by codeloanidcode.p  h2What I triedh2  pI tried different joins, products, etc but the best thing I could get out of my queries was this onep  precodeSELECT loanid, SUMpaid, SUMremaining FROM      SELECT loanid, 0 AS paid, SUMamount AS remaining     FROM Payment     WHERE paid  0     GROUP BY loanid      UNION      SELECT loanid, SUMamount AS paid, 0 AS remaining     FROM Payment     WHERE paid  1     GROUP BY loanid  GROUP BY loanid codepre  pBut I guess there should be better ways than mine.p

Negative 1289 pI wanted to ask a general question regarding this issue because I do not know where I can find my issue in my code or app. I have a J Query mobile application that has a page retrieving the database server time by calling getDate in SQL. The sql execution to retrieve this time is passed in a C web service developed in Visual Studio that returns a JSON string back tot he front end. To call the web service in C the java script has a j Query .post command to the given url containing the web service. If I run my app in a google chrome firefox browser everything is fine. The mobile app page retrieves the correct time and correct date. If I view this same content on a testing I Phone or I Pad the information I get is information I would have retrieved a few days ago or a few hours ago on my browser. I know this information may be too general but does anyone have a direction on where I should be looking at this specific issue. p  pThank you.p

Negative 1289 pI am currently developing a custom made web browser using c with different predefined capabilities. One of the problem that I encountered is adding a progress bar on the status strip. The first technique that i used to achieve this is by getting the strongwebBrowser.Doument.Titlestrong and throwing it to the strongstatus strip labelstrong when the strongwebBrowserNavigatedstrong event has been triggered. Now this is acceptable because it is working properly, but when I decided to make my webBrowser capable of adding new tabs, my job got a lot more harder. I used the strongExtended Web Browserstrong for me to achieve this which I also found here at SO. Here are the problems that is constantly giving me the headaches. I am a newbie in c so for me I think this problems are extremely hard. p  precodeprivate void webNavigatedobject sender, WebBrowserNavigatedEventArgs e              ExtendedWebBrowser webnavigated  new ExtendedWebBrowser         statusLoading.Text  Loading   ExtendedWebBrowserTabControl1.SelectedTab.Controls[0]      codepre  ol lipThe Loading labels text only shows the selected tab, when you click the other tabs it will still show the loading status of that specific page that you previously navigated not the status of the tab you are currently at. I think this is nonarguable because i am using this line on the navigated event. I cant find any other way of calling the tabBrowser other than selectedTab.Controls[0]. I am not sure if the work around here is programatically adding a status bar on each tab which I dont know how to do or even know if its possible.pli lipNow that I have mentioned tabbing on my browser, if I may ask is it possible to add a loading gif on the side of the Tab Title indicating that the browser on that tab is still loading If anyone can teach me how to do it that is a tremendous help for me.  pli lipAs I have said I am using Labels to indicate my browser is loading, as the title implies i wish and i pray i can make it a progress bar. The problem with label is that when the browsers page is taking too long to load the user would presume that my system is not doing anything.pli ol  pSo that covers it all, I appreciate everyone that helped me with my previous question, this question is a little bit tricky i hope i made this one very clear.

Negative 1289 pI am using a MATLAB script to tune the control system on a machine. When the tuning is complete, I would like a report containing text especially serial number, datetime and the values determined during tuning and plots, especially transfer functions. p  pWhat do to you recommendp  pWhatever solution I use should be compatible with the MATLAB compiler so I can distribute my solution to a team of field engineers.p  pIdeally the report will be a PDF document.p  pThe MATLAB report generator does not seem to be the right product as it appears that I have to break up my script into little pieces and embed them in the report template. My script contains opportunities for the user to intervene and change values or reject the tune if plots dont look right and my hunch is that this will be difficult if the code runs from the report generator. Also, I fear code structure and maintainability will be lost if the code structure is determined by the requirements of the report template. p  pPlease comment if my assumptions are wrong.p
Negative 1289 pThe a hrefhttpalgo.inria.frflajoletPublicationsFlFuGaMe07.pdfHyperLogLoga  algorithm by Flajolet et al describes a clever way to estimate the cardinality of a set using only a tiny amount of memory.  However, it does take into  account all N elements of the original set in the calculation.  What if we had access to only a small random sample say, 10 of the original N Has there been any research on how HyperLogLog or similar algorithms can be adapted to this situationp  pI am aware that this is essentially the problem described as emdistinct  value estimationem, for which abundant research exists see for example a hrefhttpwww.vldb.orgconf1995P311.PDFthis papera for an overview.  However, the research on the distinct value estimation that Im aware of uses a number of adhoc estimators very different from the approach used by HyperLogLog. Therefore, I am wondering if someone has already thought of adapting HyperLogLog to the distinct value estimation problem. p

Negative 1289 pI am enhancing a java based ETL software.

I want my software to be smarter than this  I want it to figure out Oracle UNDO space, estimate how many deletes would be triggered and limit batch size accordingly.

However, this led me to having an enourmous jar with tons of external libraries inside, most of them already provided by the running environment.

Negative 1289 pI work on a Java EE web application that uses a combination of Dojo and plain javascript for the frontend. p  pWeve discovered that when ResourceBundle properties are used in javascript, in some cases they end up breaking code. Specifically, this happens when the properties contain quotes single and double amp escape sequences n, s ....p  pThe solution seems to be to include extra escape characters. For instance, n needs to be prepended by one more slash n when used in a Js alert  to correctly render the line break, and Quotes if not escaped truncate the content prematurely for obvious reasons.p  pOur solution to the above issues so far has been to put in the extra escape characters in the property files itself. But this is something that we would like to move away from. It seems like this might be a widespread problem and Id like to hear from the experts on how you might have solved this problem.p  pCurrent Usage codekeyA newline is represented with n and this  is within quotes .codep  pEnvisioned Usage  codekeyA newline is represented with n and this  is within quotes .codep  pPS We typically use the codeltfmtmessagegtcode tag to access these values in the front end and for use in javascript.p

Negative 1289 pSo I have a grid of tiles.p  pa hrefhttpjsfiddle.netF5SbD1 relnofollowjs fiddleap  pIm trying to flip them based on the mouseenter direction eg if the mouse enters from the bottom, the tile flips upwards, if the mouse enters from the left the tile flips right. The problem arises as you need to rotate the back of the tiles to the correct orientation before transforming them in order to get the rotation in the correct direction.p  pThe toggle is supposed to flip all the tiles into position two whereupon they can be rotated in reverse on hover.p  pIf you look at my script Ive added classes on mouseenter to give me a hook for my direction. Ive tried with keyframes to try to set the alignment for the tiles before they rotate and I couldnt get the tiles to rerotate on mouseout. Ive also used a method which performs the rotation of the back of the tile to the correct orientation and then fires the animation 10ms after.

The data will be input through excel files.p  pSo during the times from the last update to the next update the data in the database does not change.p  pI am looking for ways to improve performance by caching the data. p  pWhen any user searches the data, I want to retrieve it from the database and cache it, so that for the next time when a search occurs I would search the cache and only if it is not in the cache I would retrieve it from the database and present it to the user and also cache it.p  pI can invalidate the cache when the event of data input occurs once a month.p  pI looked up in the internet and I could find information regarding offline databases, but I do not think that applies for this scenerio.p  pIs there any functionality within .net that allows tables to be available offline or are there any other well defined solutions for this problem, which I am sure I am not the first one to face.p  pThe database is SQL Server 2008, if it helps.p

Negative 1289 pIve run into a problem changing the state of my infoboxs buttons when clicked.  I have three states for each of the six buttons within the infobox menu  unclicked, hover, and clicked.  The buttons change to the clicked state, but for some reason they dont change back when clicked again.  Therefore, Ive located my problem to the if statement within the buttonState function thats called on each click.  Once I solve this problem Ill be adding another function to the onClick of each button, telling the infobox which piece of  dynamic information to display.  Ill also have to figure out how to make sure only one button is in the clicked state at one time.  Any help with that would be great as well.  p  pAs you can see, Im new to jquery and javascript.  Any help would be appreciated.

Heres what I mean by working fine after the method goes in the first success, I want some divs to be hidden and  the message I get as a result from the ajax call to be shown. The second time the first success is entered, another string will be ADDED to the previous. In the end, when the second success part is entered, that message is hidden and Im showing some data.p  pAnd this is what happens everything is fine until MyMethod is called. When it gets called, the browser stops working. If I press my left mouse key, nothing happens. When MyMethod is called for the last time, the browser works fine, I get quick glimpse of the message and then it shows the data from the second ajax call. And the message that I see shortly is the whole message, from all the calls to MyMethod, which shouldnt happen.p  pI want it to be shown for the entire for loop and before the Finish method. And it shouldnt be the same message. It should get bigger with every ajax call to MyMethod.p

Negative 1289 pI dont have a problem yet, since my application works, but I want to understand whats going on so I dont get into trouble later. Im primarily a databaseweb application programmer, so threads arent normally my thing p  pstrongShort version does the UI need to lock form data when multiple threads are updating itstrongp  pI have a simple Winforms application using DataGridViews that scans files for certain content and displays the results to the user. I at first did this all in the UI thread but learned that was not a good idea and settled on using ThreadPool.QueueUserWorkItem for [ProcessorCount] collections of items. This works fine, using delegates and BeginInvoke functionality to fire results to the UI as they are found. Though sometimes there are too many results and the UI still lags, but thats another problem.p  pThe worker threads are completely isolated, doing their own thing. I understand the concept of multiple threads and needing to be aware of accessing shared data at the same time. What Im not entirely clear on, however, is what happens when the various threads call the UI thread to update it. Only the UI will be updating controls and formlevel variables but since the calls come from the other threads, how does this play out For example, if Im adding items to a List or incrementing a counter, can a call from one worker thread interrupt another Each BeginInvoke is its own call, but modifying the data seems like it could still be a problem.p  pNone of the examples of BeginInvoke Ive found mention any need for locking in the UI.

And Yes, I realize that  these numbers are not actually correct for the above locations but it does work in generating a location pin. p  pI want to make the Javascript below work with the limited unique XML info name and address that my wiki site actually provides, which is p  precodeltmarkersgt ltmarker nameRadio City Music Hall address1260 Avenue of the Americas, New York, NYgt ltmarker nameW Hotel, Times Square address1567 Broadway at 47th St, New York City, NYgt ltmarker nameColumbia University Student Service Centre address1140 Amsterdam Ave., New York,   NYgt       ltmarkersgt codepre  pIve read the documentation on the google site above and Ive tried refactoring but I just cant get the limited xml with name and address only to work . p  pDoes anyone know how I can refactor the code below so that only Google maps geocoder will look up the XMLs address and provide the necessary lat and long to put a location pin on the map I know that Google places limits on the number of geocoding requests but I can worry about map caching and creating my own lat and long. coordinates later.  In the code below, I also dont need distance calculation, so I think I can delete the methods searchLocations and searchLocationsNearcenter. p  pAlso, how would I get rid of the user input Right now, the javascript bode generates a user search box where the user clicks a Search button and then it provides the info.

Negative 1289 pWere getting overnight lockups on our embedded Arm linux product but are having trouble pinning it down.  It usually takes 1216 hours from power on for the problem to manifest itself.  Ive installed sysstat so I can run sar logging, and Ive got a bunch of data, but Im having trouble interpreting the results.p  pThe targets only have 512Mb RAM we have other models which have 1Gb, but they see this issue much less often, and have no disk swap files to avoid wearing the eMMCs.p  pSome kind of paging  virtual memory event is initiating the problem.  In the sar logs, pgpins, pgnscands and pgsteals, and majflts all increase steadily before snowballing to crazy levels.  This puts the CPU up correspondingly high levels 3060 on dual core Arm chips.  At the same time, the frmpgs values go very negative, whilst campgs go highly positive.  The upshot is that the system is trying to allocate a large amount of cache pages all at once.  I dont understand why this would be.p  pThe target then essentially locks up until its rebooted or someone kills the main GUI process or it crashes and is restarted We have a monolithic GUI application that runs all the time and generally does all the serious work on the product.  The network shuts down, telnet blocks forever, as do proc filesystem queries and things that rely on it like top.  The memory allocation profile of the main application in this test is dominated by reading data in from file and caching it as textures in video memory shared with main RAM in an LRU  using OpenGL ES 2.0.  Most of the time itll be accessing a single file they are about 50Mb in size, but I guess it could be triggered by having to suddenly use a new file and trying to cache all 50Mb of it all in one go.  I havent done the test putting more logging in to correlate this event with these system effects yet.p  pThe odd thing is that the actual free and cached RAM levels dont show an obvious lack of memory I have seen oomkiller swoop in the kill the main application with 100Mb free and 40Mb cache RAM.  The main applications memory usage seems reasonably wellbehaved with a VmRSS value that seems pretty stable.  Valgrind hasnt found any progressive leaks that would happen during operation.  p  pThe behaviour seems like that of a system frantically swapping out to disk and making everything run dog slow as a result, but I dont know if this is a known effect in a freeltcache RAM exchange system.  p  pMy problem is superficially similar to question a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions12648023linuxhighkernelcpuusageonmemoryinitializationlinux high kernel cpu usage on memory initializationa but that issue seemed driven by disk swap file management.  However, dirty page flushing does seem plausible for my issue.p  pI havent tried playing with the various vm files under procsysvm yet.  vfscachepressure and possibly swappiness would seem good candidates for some tuning, but Id like some insight into good values to try here.  vfscachepressure seems illdefined as to what the difference between setting it to 200 as opposed to 10000 would be quantitatively.p  pThe other interesting fact is that it is a progressive problem.  It might take 12 hours for the effect to happen the first time.  If the main app is killed and restarted, it seems to happen every 3 hours after that fact.  A full cache purge might push this back out, though.p  pHeres a link to the log data with two files, sar1.log, which is the complete output of sar A, and overview.log, a extract of free  cache mem, CPU load, MainGuiApp memory stats, and the B and R sar outputs for the interesting period between midnight and 340amp  pa hrefhttpsdrive.google.comfolderviewid0B615EGF3fosPZ2kwUDlURk1XNFEampuspsharing relnofollowhttpsdrive.google.comfolderviewid0B615EGF3fosPZ2kwUDlURk1XNFEampuspsharingap  pSo, to sum up, whats my best plan here  Tune vm to tend to recycle pages more often to make it less bursty  Are my assumptions about whats happening even valid given the log data  Is there a cleverer way of dealing with this memory usage modelp  pThanks for your help.p  pstrongUpdate 5th June 2013strong Ive tried the brute force approach and put a script on which echoes 3 to dropcaches every hour.  This seems to be maintaining the steady state of the system right now, and the sar B stats stay on the flat portion, with very few major faults and 0.0 pgscands.  However, I dont understand why keeping the cache RAM very low mitigates a problem where the kernel is trying to add the universe to cache RAM.p

Negative 1289 pHeres what I am trying to solve. I have bezier curves that contain 3 points x1, y1, x2, y2, x3, y3 that are in a 2dimensional plane. What I am trying to figure out is if a fourth point is clicked by a user on the bezier curves whether the click point lies between points 1 and 2 or if lies between points 2 and 3. The click point is only recorded when the line is directly clicked so it must lie between either points 1 and 2 or points 2 and 3.p  pThe lines are randomly created at compile time and can start and end from any x, y position. img srchttpi.stack.imgur.comjzoeZ.png altexample of a curvep  pThe 3 sets of points that make up the line are the start point, curve point and the end point.

Negative 1289 pI am trying to figure out the best way to create an alternative to the C template or the Java generic objects.  I have wanted to do this several times in the past for several different reasons, however right now what I want to do is related to creating the saveobj and loadobj functions for several related classes.  The idea is that I want to have a generic set of routines to create a default struct and then manipulate that a little bit farther to get the structs the way I want them.p  pI cannot simply use an external function because I need access to all the public not a problem and protected problem nontransient properties of an object in order to create the loadobj and saveobj.p  pThen I considered using an abstract interface.  However, using an abstract interface leaves me with the same problem identical, copy an pasted code floating around in all of my object files.  So then I thought of using some sort of full blown object combined with multiple inheritance Most of my objects are already inheriting from a basic concretion of interfaces.  I thought using a superclass would allow me to expose the subclass protected properties, but it doesnt seem to work that way.  Any suggestionsp  pHere is a sample of the multiple inheritance approach the closest thing I have so far for the save obj approach.p  pSerializer.mp  precode Serializer.m classdef Serializer     methods     function [saveObj]  saveobj obj          Get metadata about the Object       meta  metaclass obj        meta  meta.PropertyList        for p  meta         if p.Transient  p.Dependent           continue  Only serialize the correct fields         end          saveobj.p.Name   obj.p.Name   Serialize       end  for  property      end  function  saveobj    end  methods end  classdef  Serializer  codepre  pTestSerializerA.mp  precode TestSerializerA.m classdef TestSerializerA lt Serializer   properties     PropA  a   end  properties  public     properties Access  protected      HiddenA  ha   end  properties  protected  end  classdef  TestSerializerA  codepre  pTestSerializerB.mp  precode TestSerializerB.m classdef TestSerializerB lt TestSerializerA amp Serializer    properties     PropB  b   end    properties Access  protected      HiddenB  hb   end  properties  protected   end  classdef  TestSerializerB    codepre
Negative 1289 pIm instrumenting my .NET 4.5 applications to emit ETW events using the codeEventSourcecode class. The goal is to be able to capture some of these events the Error level events for error logging. p  pAfter doing some reading and testing, I am concerned about the reliability of this approach to error logging, specifically regarding the possibility of dropped or missing events. If my error logging isnt working I need the application to shut down in my case it is unsafe for it to run with unreported errors. When using ETW and codeEventSourcecode, how can I be certain that my errors are getting properly recordedp  pObviously part of the answer will depend on what is listening to the events. In my case I plan to use the Semantic Logging Application Block from the latest MS Enterprise Library.p  pHere is one source where Microsoft talks about the possible causes of missed events a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibrarywindowsdesktopaa36366828vvs.8529.aspxAbout Event Tracingap  pThere they list these possible causes of Missing Eventsp  blockquote   ul   lipThe total event size is greater than 64K. This includes the ETW header plus the data or payload. A user has no control over these missing events since the event size isconfigured by the application.pli   lipThe ETW buffer size is smaller than the total event size. A user has no control over these missing events since the event size is configured by the application logging the events.pli   lipFor realtime logging, the realtime consumer is not consuming events fast enough or is not present altogether and then the backing file is filling up. This can result if the Event Log service is stopped and started when events are being logged. A user has no control over these missing events.pli   lipWhen logging to a file, the disk is too slow to keep up with the logging rate.pli   ul blockquote  pTo see if these concerns were somehow mitigated using the EventSource class like, does it truncate large payloads somehow I did some testing. I tried to log long strings and it failed for me between 30,000 and 35,000 characters right in line with the 64KB maximum event payload. It just silently does nothing from what I can tell for the toolarge strings, no events at all in my Semantic Logging Application Block log.  Events before and after were written like usual.p  pSo anytime I have a string in my payload I have to pass it through some truncator Will I need to manually avoid generating events too fast as well and how would that be possiblep  pMicrosoft Patterns and Practices are supposed to lead us to good ... patterns and practices ... so maybe Im just missing something here.p  pUpdatep  pWell apparently there is some notice in the consuming application for the Events too fast condition. I received this today for the first time p  blockquote   pLevel  Warning, Message  Some events will be lost because of buffer overruns or schema synchronization delays in trace session MicrosoftSemanticLoggingEtwsvcRuntimep blockquote  pAnd then when closing the sessionp  blockquote   pLevel  Warning, Message  The loss of 1 events was detected in trace session MicrosoftSemanticLoggingEtwsvcRuntime.p blockquote  pUpdate2p  pThe a hrefhttpsentlib.codeplex.comdownloadsget668950Enterprise Library Developers Guidea describes the behavior I just mentioned. p  blockquote   pYou should monitor the log messages generated by the Semantic Logging Application Block for any indication that the have buffers overflowed and that you have lost messages. For example, log messages with event ids 900 and 901 indicate that a sinks internal buffers have overflowed in the outofprocess scenario, event ids 806 and 807 indicate that the ETW buffers have overflowed. You can modify the buffering configuration options for the sinks to reduce the chance that the buffers overflow with your typical workloads.p blockquote  pMy question remains, can I use semantic logging while ensuring my application does not run if errors are being dropped  Normal tracing events could be dropped ...p  pMy current thought is to log critical errors with a separate class using oldfashioned logging techniques, and keep less critical errors as well as debug type events going through the ETW pipeline. That wouldnt be too bad really ... I might post that as a solution if I cant find a better suggestion.p  pUpdate 3p  pThe missing events warning that I received had nothing to do with buffer overruns, turns out this is the message you get if you pass a null codestringcode as a payload value.p

Negative 1289 pI would like to export a HTML table to Excel.p  pI have a looked at various client side options with jQuery plugins to export HTML tables to CSV and Excel, but these are not good as they are not supported in IE and in addition gives a warning message in all browsers. Also for larger Excel files, client side export is not optimal.p  pI have also looked at PHPExcel as I am using PHP, but there does not seem to be any native support for exporting a HTML table to Excel. And considering that I have custom tables which are modified based on input from the database, I cannot print the database object directly to PHPExcel.p  pI am using the Yii framework with a MVC approach.p  pSo what I really want is to be able to export my HTML tables to Excel.

Negative 1289 pI am trying to back my UICollectionViews data source with a data structure that for good reasons is more than two layers deep. In other words, my data can be broken into sections, but not all of those sections simply contain items. Some contain emarraysem of items or nested sections, so to speak. These items can be easily be referenced with an index path emthreeem indices long 3.2.4, for instance, but UICollectionViews data source methods only seem to support index paths up to emtwoem indices long.p  pAll of the UICollectionView APIs use NSIndexPaths to reference collection view items, so in theory they should work with any number of indices. The challenge is getting the collection view to know to ask for cells, layout attributes, etc. for items at these deeper indices when the data source protocol only provides codecollectionViewnumberOfItemsInSectioncode and codenumberOfSectionsInCollectionViewcode to specify the indices it needs to ask for.p  pIs there any way around this that doesnt require me to a subclass UICollectionView, which a hrefhttpsdeveloper.apple.comlibraryiosdocumentationWindowsViewsConceptualCollectionViewPGforIOSCreatingCustomLayoutsCreatingCustomLayouts.html relnofollowApple explicitly discouragesa second point under Tips for Implementing Your Custom Layouts or b flatten my data structure, which would be less than ideal, and which seems unnecessarily limited given the APIs UICollectionView already providesp

Sadly, after I commented  like this is like a blind trying to lead a deaf, the rage to punish me as the alleged offender, and to support the alleged victim, got blown out of proportions and resulted in irrational downvotes and upvotes.

Negative 1289 pI have 2 tables that I need to join to get the lastlatest update in the 2nd table based on valid rows in the 1st table. p  pCode below is en example.p  pstrongTable 1 Registered usersstrongbr This table contains a list of users registered in the system.  When a user gets registered it gets added into this table. A user is registered with a name, and a registration time.  A user can get deregistered from the system. When this is done, the deregistration column gets updated to the time that the user was removed. If this value is NULL, it means that the user is still registered.p  precodeCREATE TABLE users      entryidx   SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,     name        TEXT NOT NULL,     regtime    TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE NOT NULL DEFAULT NOW,     deregtime  TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NULL    codepre  pstrongTable 2 User updatesstrongbr This table contains updates on the users. Each time a user changes a property example position the change gets stored in this table. No updates must be removed since there is a requirement to keep history in the table. p  precodeCREATE TABLE userupdates      entryidx   SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,     name        TEXT NOT NULL,     position    INTEGER NOT NULL,     time        TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW  codepre  pstrongRequired outputstrongbr So given the above information, I need to get a new table that contains only the last update for the current registered users. p  pstrongTest Datastrongbr The following data can be used as test data for the above tablesp  precode Register 3 users INSERT INTO usersname VALUES Person1 INSERT INTO usersname VALUES Person2 INSERT INTO usersname VALUES Person3  Add some updates for all users INSERT INTO userupdatesname, position VALUES Person1, 0 INSERT INTO userupdatesname, position VALUES Person1, 1 INSERT INTO userupdatesname, position VALUES Person1, 2 INSERT INTO userupdatesname, position VALUES Person2, 1 INSERT INTO userupdatesname, position VALUES Person3, 1  Unregister the 2nd user UPDATE users SET deregtime  NOW WHERE name  Person2 codepre  pFrom the above, I want the last updates for Person 1 and Person 3.p  pstrongFailed attemptstrongbr I have tried using joins and other methods but the results are not what I am looking for. The question is almost the same as one asked a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions9464365postgresqljoin2tablesherea. I have used the solution in answer 1 and it does give the correct answer, but it takes too long to get too the answer in my system. p  pBased on the above link I have created the following query that worksp  precodeSELECT   t1.   , t2. FROM   users t1 JOIN    SELECT       t.,       rownumber   OVER        PARTITION BY         t.name       ORDER BY t.entryidx DESC        rn   FROM userupdates t    t2 ON   t1.name  t2.name AND   t2.rn  1 WHERE   t1.deregtime IS NULL codepre  pstrongProblemstrong The problem with the above query is that it takes very long to complete. Table 1 contains a small list of users, while table 2 contains a huge amount of updates. I think that the query might be inefficient in the way that it handles the 2 tables based on my limited understanding of the query. From pgAdmins explain it does a lot of sorting and aggregation on the updates 1st before joining with the registered table. p  pstrongQuestionstrongbr How can I formulate a query to efficiently and fast get the latest updates for registered users p

Negative 1289 pI am trying to develop a fast algorithm in python for finding peaks in an image and then finding the centroid of those peaks. I have written the following code using the scipy.ndimage.label and ndimage.findobjects for locating the objects. This seems to be the bottleneck in the code, and it takes about 7 ms to locate 20 objects in a 500x500 image. I would like to scale this up to larger 2000x2000 image, but then the time increases to almost 100 ms. So, Im wondering if there is a faster option.p  pHere is the code that I have so far, which works, but is slow. First I simulate my data using some gaussian peaks.

Negative 1289 pI am new in Jenkins. I configured a job, which gets the source from SVN, then calls an Ant build file. Inside the And build, there is a Maven call, done by the Maven Ant Tasks plugin. Additionally I have a changed settings.xml for maven, where I have configured a repository other than the default maven central repo. If I call the Ant build from the command line, it works fine. It finds the correct settings.xml at my user home .m2settings.xml. But the same script doesnt work from Jenkins. The log shows that it tries to get things from the maven central repo, so not my custom settings.xml is used. I created a .m2 directory with my custom settings.xml to several places, but it still doesnt find it. Also I have added the Config File Provider Plugin to Jenkins and added my custom settings.xml.

What I want is to set each individual columns width and have the horizontal scrollbar appear automatically if the total width is too long.p  pstrongUpdatestrong After seeing Olegs awesome demo, I ended up coding this in the dqGrid 4.5.4 itself.

Negative 1289 pHere a beginners question.p  pIs there any difference in JAVA between passing an object as argument to a method or returning that object from the method. For instance Is it better to pass a List as an argument and fill it in the method or just allow the method to return a listp  pMy guess is that it should be no difference since a reference is returned and nothing is copied. But is there something more subtle behindp  pthanks in advancep  pAltoberp

Negative 1289 pI want a user to ssh and only have access to my CLI. This is currently done by executing a command in .profile, which runs the cli as another user this is done in sudoers, they can only run the CLI as this user and nothing else. One issue I have is the user can still run commands with shh, say bash, which is something I want to restrict. Theres also an archive I want the user to be able to transfer with sftp. Im thinking Ill just make another user and chroot them so they only have access to that one file. I looked into doing this with the same user but chrooting them while still allowing the to use the CLI and restricting remote ssh commands seems like a nightmare. Sorry if this is confusing, Im having trouble verbalizing all this and dont have much experience with this type of stuff.p  pIn summary I basically want top  pAllow a user to ssh, but only have access to my CLIp  pPrevent the user from doing whatever else with sshp  pAllow transfer of a diagnostics archivep  pAnyone have some ideas on the best way to accomplish all this Please let me know if theres any other information that would be helpful.

Shouldnt it return a 1 because the stream is finishedp  pBecause the read function is stalling, I am unable to stop the thread. I would use thread.stop but this is deprecated and unstable so I want to avoid it. Ive also tried using InputStream.available to see if there is anything available before performing a read, but this returns a 0, even when there are bytes available to be read.

Negative 1289 pAt the moment I am building an iPhone application which has several purposes. One of the purposes a dashboard for known users need to login. Inside the UINavigationController I use a UIView with a simple button. On the button press I go to either the dashboard page of the login page using a push segue. This works exactly like I intend to do.p  pBut when I am on the login page, after filling the right login credentials, and press the login button. I can go to the dashboard page, but when I press the back button, Ill enter the login page again. Which is not what I want. So I searched for ways to delete the page of the viewControllers array in self.navigationController.viewControllers which should do the job. But this is where I am stuck...p  pWhat is the right way to remove a UIViewController from the stack I tried several things likep  precode voidviewDidLoad      [super viewDidLoad]      NSMutableArray viewControllersInStack  [NSMutableArray arrayWithArrayself.navigationController.viewControllers]      if[viewControllersInStack count] gt 3              [viewControllersInStack removeObjectAtIndex1]           self.navigationController.viewControllers  [[NSArray alloc] initWithArrayviewControllersInStack]     [self.navigationController setViewControllers[[NSArray alloc] initWithArrayviewControllersInStack] animatedYES]  codepre  pPutting this in the dashboard class gave me the most success. When pressing the back button in the UINavigationBar, itll enter the first page but without the UINavigationBar item, but I can press the back button one more time which shouldnt be possible. If I press it, itll show an empty page with the UINavigationBar item. I have this item for a link to a more information page.p  pIn the login class I tried several things when pressing the login button, some of them arep  precode[self.navigationController popViewControllerAnimatedNO] [self performSegueWithIdentifierloginToDashboard senderself]  DashBoardViewController dashboard  [DashBoardViewController alloc] [self.navigationController popToViewControllerUIViewController dashboard animatedYES]  [self.navigationController popToRootViewControllerAnimatedNO] [self performSegueWithIdentifierhomeToDashboard senderself] codepre  pThe loginToDashboard segue is the one from the login page to the dashboard and the homeToDashboard is from the root to the dashboard.But all of these will give me an exception likep  pTerminating app due to uncaught exception NSInvalidArgumentException, reason Receiver  has no segue with identifier homeToDashboardp  porp  pTerminating app due to uncaught exception NSGenericException, reason Could not find a navigation controller for segue loginToDashboard. Push segues can only be used when the source controller is managed by an instance of UINavigationController.p  pUpdatep  pI have the following codep  precode voidviewDidLoad      [super viewDidLoad]      self.navigationItem.hidesBackButton  YES      UIBarButtonItem button  self.navigationItem.backBarButtonItem      [button setTitleTest]     [button setActionselectorreturnToHome]      self.navigationItem.backBarButtonItem  button      UIBarButtonItem backBarButton  [[UIBarButtonItem alloc] initWithTitlelt Home styleUIBarButtonItemStyleBordered targetself actionselectorreturnToHome]     self.navigationItem.leftBarButtonItem  backBarButton    voidreturnToHome      [self.navigationController popToRootViewControllerAnimatedYES]  codepre  pNow the code works like a charm But...

Negative 1289 pI am setting up an environment to do some testing. Our build actually happens on our Team Foundation Server TFS, which also spawns two Linux builds via SSH. The result of our build is 6 different configurations, including Windows and Linux both 32 and 64 bit its C code with a Python layer on top, and two Python versions. The output looks something like thisp  ul liBuildXX  ul lifoolnx26 li lifoolnx2664 li lifoolnx27 li lifoolnx2764 li lifoowin27li lifoowin2764 Testsli ulli ul  pOn the test slaves, I would like it to look like thisp  ul liWORKSPACE ul lifoo... just one of theseli liTestsli ulli ul  pThe Test folder contains a bunch of Python test scripts. For each platform, I want to copy the Tests folder and only the appropriate output folder for that platform. The output is pretty large so I want to avoid copying more than necessary. We want to run these tests on every checkin. I am not looking to change how we build the code, at least not yet, just looking to add some additional hardware testing. To cover all our testing needs, I need to run tests on Windows and Linux, both 32 and 64 bit, with combinations of other hardware our code interacts with.p  pBasic requirements arep  ul liNeed to run on various platforms.  ul liI am using a multiconfiguration Matrix job for this, which works very well for routing the child jobs.li ulli liNeed to copy the output only for the specific platform to the slave.li liFiles to copy will be on a Windows server. li liSlaves are both Windows and Linuxli liJenkins will be called from the TFS build when it succeeds probably via Python actuallyli liThere is a new directory for each TFS build. I need to specify that directory as a parameter to Jenkins.li ul  pI have tried several approaches, but none seem to do just what I needp  ol liFile System SCM plugin. I cant find a way to use a parametervariable for the source directory for this. Also, it doesnt seem to work for copying from Windows to Linuxli liCopy To Slave plugin. This can copy the files, but not to where I want them. Even setting my own custom Paths are relative to value which I didnt see documented, just stumbled on it, I still end up with extra subdirectories under the workspace folder. Using a matrix job, theres already a bunch of folders there. Its also a problem because I need to know where I am to set things like PYTHONPATH for my testing.li liPublish Over SSH plugin I spent a lot of time trying to figure this one out and just couldnt make it work. There is a lot of configuration involved, much more than I would like. It doesnt really seem to be design to manage pulling files from a server to a slave machine it is a publisher.... I think I was looking at this a bit backwards, but cant figure out an easy way to make it do what I need.li ol  pAt this point, I am probably just going to write shell script code to call rsync to move the files, similar to how I fire the Linux builds from our TFS build. It just seems like I shouldnt have to do this. All I want is to copy two sudirectories although not the same two from a dynamic directory to each slave. Seems like not that unusual a bit of functionality. Am I missing somethingp

I want the app to find the current location of the user and give them directions to a predefined address.

To add this feature to my project I followed the directions on these two sitesp  pa hrefhttpsdeveloper.android.comgoogleplayservicessetup.html relnofollowhttpsdeveloper.android.comgoogleplayservicessetup.htmla a hrefhttpsdeveloper.android.comtoolsprojectsprojectseclipse.htmlReferencingLibraryProject relnofollowhttpsdeveloper.android.comtoolsprojectsprojectseclipse.htmlReferencingLibraryProjectap  pThe problem is on the second site, when i added the library to my already existing project it caused all of my code that has strongfindViewByIdR.id.whateverstrong or strongsetContentViewR.layout.whateverstrong to become errors. It is now telling me that i need to import the class R. If I do that it then gives me error messages on the names of all my xml files. p  pFor example in my MainActivity it is telling me that i should change strongsetContentViewR.layout.activitymainstrong to strongsetContentViewR.layout.activitylistitemstrong and does this for all references to my xml files for the entire project. p  pI tried going back and removing the google play services library from the project and starting over but when I removed it the errors still persists. I also tried using the fix project setup option in Eclipse but it didnt fix the problem. p  pIm wondering if anyone here has experienced this problem before If so, how can I fix it The application had no errors before I tried to include the google play services library. I am new to Android development so a lot of the information I have found has been either confusing to understand or doesnt seem to include enough details for me to figure it out.

Negative 1289 pIm a complete newbie when it comes to using libraries, so any assistance would be very welcome.p  pI use CodeBlocks and am trying to link my code with libraries. I have two libraries to be linked  libone.a and libtwo.so.p  pSo, according to this , albeit older, a hrefhttpwww.learncpp.comcpptutoriala3usinglibrarieswithcodeblocks relnofollowtutoriala, I rightclicked the project in CodeBlocks, went to Project build options  Linker settings, and added both of the libraries. I also went to Search Directories  Compiler, and Search Directories  linker and added the path of the libraries.p  pNow, one of these libraries contains a file called dis.hxx. However, when i put  include lt dis.hxx   into my program, it states fatal error dis.hxx No such file or directory. Note that this header file is inside the .a file, not unpacked.p  pAm I understanding the concept of libraries wrong How can I make this workp

Negative 1289 pIm sending a sidekiq job with a parameter that is confidential and I would like that parameter to be filtered so that no log or user is ever able to see it.

Negative 1289 pThis may be a really dumb question but Ive been searching the interwebs and havent really found much helpful information. I have CodeKit 2 and I want to use Wordpress and Bootstrap in a project. Ive never used Bower before but it looks really cool and I thought Id give it a shot with CodeKit. I installed Wordpress, JQuery, and Bootstrap through the assets tab in my project and they installed into bowercomponents. In the video from Bryan Jones showing off Bower, he says not to move anything out of that folder or CodeKit wont see it as an asset anymore.p  pSo my question is how do I go about building my project from here Obviously I dont want to have to run from the bowercomponents folder to do everything. In the Bower docs it says the easiest way is to just statically link the components you want. But I dont really understand how that would work with Wordpress and it seems like thered be a better way to do it with CodeKit.p  pThanks for the helpp

I have tried many different things to get it to work. This includes commenting out my constructor for codeMyDbContextcode, changing the codeproviderNamecode attribute of my connection string to be codeSystem.Data.SqlClientcode, changing the connection string name to be codeDefaultConnectioncode, removing my connection strings altogether, and combinations of all of these things. I make sure to rebuild between trying to add the Controller. However, after performing these different changes, I still receive the same error when I try to add a new Controller.p  pGenerally, I can find all my questions already answered, but the answers dont seem to be working for me on this one. I think what might separate my case from the ones linked is that my codeDbContextcode is actually an instance of codeIdentityDbContextcode. I believe the constructor for codeIdentityDbContextcode just calls the base constructor for it, anyway, so I dont see how this could be much of an issue.p  pAny help is much appreciated. Thank youp

Negative 1289 pIm developing a C solution in Visual Studio 2013 under Perforce source control P4VS plugin. When I first load Visual Studio I can perform a connection to my perforce depot no problem.

Onestrong, Am I right about codeobjectiveCs EXCBADACCESScode  Do I get it right p  pstrongSecondstrong, Are codeEXCBADACCESS and Segmentation faultcode same things and Apple has just improvised its namep
Negative 1289 pI have some javascript which sets the codewindow.locationcode of an codeiframecode to load another html page. For some reason this causes both the WebView and the native Android browser Chromium to crash in Android 4.3 and earlier. On Android 4.4 there are no issues. It is my understanding that on 4.3 and earlier Chromium is using the Webkit engine, and starting on 4.4 it is using a Chrome based engine.p  pIs this a known WebKitChromium issue Are there any work aroundsp  pFor what its worth, below are the log messages generated by CatLog when I replicate the issue in an emulator. Unfortunately, I dont think there is much to glean from it.p  precode0702 182432.523 Ddalvikvm750 GCCONCURRENT freed 449K, 21 free 2467K3092K, paused 15ms2ms, total 910ms 0702 182432.613

Negative 1289 pI have a decentsize codebase built at this point.  I have a couple of tables with matching Eloquent models that are storing addresses in the form code Street, City, ST, xzipxcode.  These are represented in the database by a single varchar field called codeaddresscode.p  pNow heres my issue.  I want to add a new feature that allows items to be compared by whether they are in the same city, state, etc.  The way to do this as my database is currently configured is to tokenize the address string.  This is fine, but a little annoying to have to do it every time.p  pThe ideal solution would be to restructure the database, and associated models, to split the codeaddresscode field into codestreetcode, codecitycode, codestatecode, and codezipcode.  The only problem there, would be that everywhere else, where Im currently accessing the address using codemodelgtaddresscode, I would have to construct it from the pieces.  This happens a lot throughout the code, so even creating a helper function as belowp  precodepublic function address   return thisgtstreet., .thisgtcity., .thisgtstate. .thisgtzip  codepre  pwould mandate replacing all instances of codemodelgtaddresscode with codemodelgtaddresscode, which would still be cumbersome. The ideal solution would be to create a dynamic property, like how Laravel creates them using for relationships. Is this possiblep  pOr is there a better solutionp
Negative 1289 pI have a list of data, say Supported colors. Maybe these colors each have a name, a set of aliases, a few specific RGB values that represent this color. In my site I have one page where I want to list the colors in a dropdown. In another page, I want to just have a grid displaying each color. Maybe in another page, something completely different. So my question is how can I share the data between pages, such that a change in one location where the data is defined will propagate throughout all pages in the site.p  pEnvironment This is an MVC app, using Razor sparingly, bootstrap for presentation, and JQuery for some of the interactive operations.p  pMy thoughts on a solutionp  p1 Store this list in a model that is passed to all pages. Then whenever the data is needed, I could loop over the items in the model, and present them however I wantp  p2 Store the list in javascript, and generate the HTML using javascript instead.p  p3 Use JQuery to get the list from the server, and iterate over the results to generate the appropriate HTMLp  pNote I am very new to web development, so there may be some false assumptions above, and most definitely some poorly thought out ideas  any corrections are greatly appreciatedp

A Chapter has many Lessons and a Lesson has many Videos. A Video handles downloading and when it is finished, it changes its isDownloaded to COMPLETE which is 2. The parent lesson is KVO listening for changes in isDownloaded on the child. When all the videos in a lesson are downloaded, the lesson updates isDownloaded, and the parent chapter is listening for those changes. p  pNow a Cell can hold either a Chapter or a Lesson, and Id like to be able to autogenerate the NSManagedObject subclasses, so I use categories to extend them. However, this means I cant add protocols or make the cell a delegate of the CourseType object. So as of now, I have the Cell KVO listening for changes in the CourseType objects isDownloaded and it updates its picture accordingly. However, this means that sometimes the Cell is Deallocd while still listening. p  pSo either I need to know when to remove the listener from the cell, or alternatively, find a way to update the cell without KVO. p

So the total question is this strongHow can I specify, dynamically, the number of words separated by whitespace I want while also allowing a range of special characters within those wordsstrongp  pHeres what I have currentlyp  precode Regex matchregex  [.,w] 2 s  input.scanmatchregex.toa puts s.inspect   Input Within weeks they planned a meeting. She sent him poetry along with her itinerary, having worked in a business meeting to excuse the opportunity. He prepared flowers and a banner of welcome on his hearth.    Output  seems to be grabbing last word again for some reason [[Within weeks , weeks ], [they planned , planned ], [a meeting. , meeting. ], [She sent , sent ], [him poetry , poetry ], [along with , with ], [her itinerary, , itinerary, ], [having worked , worked ], [in a , a ], [business meeting , meeting ], [to excuse , excuse ], [the opportunity. , opportunity. ], [He prepared , prepared ], [flowers and , and ], [a banner , banner ], [of welcome , welcome ], [on his , his ]]   Desired output. Im not picky if it has trailing spaces or not as I can always trim that [Within weeks, they planned, a meeting., She sent, him poetry, along with, her itinerary, having worked, in a, business meeting, to excuse, the opportunity., He prepared, flowers and, a banner, of welcome, on his] codepre  pAny help would be greatly appreciated. Thanksp

Negative 1289 pIm working through the projects in the book PHP and MySQL Web Development 4th Edition and I keep getting an error when I load up the Chapter 28 files using the CDROM provided.p  pThe chapter is on building a Shopping Cart tool using books stored in a MySQL database. The files on the CDROM contain the completed project, so I imported the SQL files and implemented the MySQL database so I could follow along with the project. However, Im having trouble accessing the administration interface.  The file login.php is the page where the admin can log in and add, edit or delete books from the list of available books to add to your shopping cart. Yet I get some errors when I open the login.php file in my browser. It looks the same as the screenshot in the textbook, except at the top of my screen I getp  precodeNotice Undefined variable SESSION in Cxampphtdocsphpmysql4eChapter28outputfns.php on line 7  Notice Undefined index totalprice in Cxampphtdocsphpmysql4eChapter28outputfns.php on line 10 codepre  pThere cant be any errors with the code, since this is the code that was in the CDROM files.  Lines 612 of outputfns.php looks like thisp  precode declare the session variables we want access to inside the function if SESSION[items]    SESSION[items]  0  if SESSION[totalprice]    SESSION[totalprice]  0.00  codepre  pNow the errors do go away if I add in      sessionstart at the top of the page, but this cant be right. Surely there is no code editing necessary since these are the files contained on the CDROM. p  pEven when I edit the code to rid the errors, Im also having trouble being able to log in to the interface. p  pThe chapter goes on to display screenshots of every page of the Shopping Cart after an admin logs in. Except I cant seem to be able to successfully log in, so Im not able to see these screenshots on my browser. After importing the SQL files, there is a table called admin in the database that was created. In admin, there is a username and password column, with one default admin already registered admin as the username, and a long random password as the password. When I enter this information in login.php, it does not work. When I edit the admin table to add a new admin user, it still does not work. I must not be connecting to my database correctly, right The pages are definitely displaying information from my database, but for some reason the browser is having trouble talking to the DB when I try to log in as an admin.p  pIt seems there should be no errors with the coding since Im just using the files provided with the CDROM. There has to be some simple error that Im completely overlooking... rightp  pThanks for reading and any help is greatly appreciated. Please let me know if more information is necessary. p

Negative 1289 pI have been working on a Facebook app for some time, and we are having trouble getting the app approved. I feel like Facebooks app approval process is a constantly moving target and their explanations are provide the least amount of detail possible, leaving the door open for further rejections. p  pWe are using a Facebook app to provide sharing functionality for products that are behind a paywall. All of our share buttons are custom, so they fit in our designs we dont want to use the out of the box buttons. We first built the app attempting to use the recommended share dialog with open graph actions and stories. The problem here is that you can only use the share dialog with a shared link. Facebook reads any open graph tags on the page to provide sharing information, but because there are many different products on a given page, we cant use open graph tags. Because of our environment, we couldnt use the actions or stories. Furthermore, wed like to customize that share information, so using share dialog is not an option. p  pUnfortunately, we had left our open graph stories and actions in our app when we first attempted approval. In our first denial, Facebook told us that we had implemented our open graph actions and stories incorrectly. We were not using the share dialog, but the feed method, which is deprecated in 2.0 but still works. Thinking that Facebook looked at our app and noticed we were not using those actions correctly, we figured if we removed those stories and actions from the app, Facebook would see our share method worked and approve us. Wrong.p  pWe had built the share using the publishactions permission, along with FB.login and FB.ui. Facebook denied us because our app did not need publishactions. They recommended we use the share dialog which did not need login or permissions.p  pWe removed the publishactions permission and FB.login. When we tested this, you could still login to Facebook and perform the share WITHOUT fb.login. So we thought it was good to go. It was not Facebook told us we needed to implement login, even thought the docs say you emdontem need it.p  pNow we have reimplemented login and are going to try to get it approved again, but I have a feeling its going to get rejected due to the feed method being deprecated. p  pSo my questions are  A If you have a website providing a paid service, how do you allow your users to post to their feeds, using the newer share method, with data youd like Eg I just completed the Get Moving III workout at teamexos.com The post would contain no pics or links. If it had to, a link to teamexos.com would be ok.p  pB How do paid sites provide open graph actions and stories Do they have public links to their products Do those products have their own individual pages, with their own open graph tags   p

Negative 1289 pI have an app with a tabview as the initial view controller. Segues hook up the tabview buttons to the other view controllers, and everything is fine except for the masterdetail view. Masterdetail are two different views. None of this is in code, it is all in the storyboard.p  pWhen I go into the master view, and then use the tab bar controller to go to other views everything works great. When I go into the detail view and use the tab bar for navigation, everything works fine as well until I try to go to the master view. When I try to go back to the master view using the tab bar, I am directed to the detail view. I would always like to start with the master and then proceed to the detail.p  pTo state this a little differently, when I use the tab bar to leave the master view and them come back to the master it works fine. When I leave the detail view and then use the tab bar to return to the master, I am directed to the detail view.

Negative 1289 pIm trying out the currently available master branch of JediVim and the Jedi library with gVim 7.4 Windows, python is available and working. I have installed JediVim with Pathogen. No other plugins are installed, I have JediVim and Pathogen only. My .vimrc doesnt implement anything fancy.p  pJediVim has been an awesome tool so far most everything is working however Ive noticed that function argument tooltips popup with some garbled characters before the tooltip text starts, for example the print tooltip popoup looks like the as actually have a circumflex accentp  precode                                                                                aijedi0, ai    value, ..., sep   , end  n, file  sys.stdout aijediai  print codepre  pSo, the print function argument help is there, but is surrounded by odd strings of characters. Has anyone else encountered this issue The pictures at the a hrefhttpsgithub.comdavidhalterjedivim relnofollowrepoa show tooltips without the extra crazy characters. Im thinking this may have something to do with my use of this on Windows, or with the fact Im using the Jedi library as a subrepo at emCvimvim74bundlejedivimmasterjediem. Any suggestionsp
Negative 1289 pBasically on my site I have a sticky nav that has a transparent background. Below that I have light or dark colored content divs.p  pWhat Im trying to achieve is as you scroll, a javascript function is actively determining if the sticky nav is on top of a light or dark content div, based on that divs classname or a data attribute, whichever, and changing the color of the text in the sticky nav so its visible over the content div.p  pa hrefhttpjsfiddle.nettenoldbbazcyc8 relnofollowstrongFiddlestrongap  pCurrently I dont have any javascript started as I dont know how to detect if one div is over another.

When I post something, I simply press a button on another app which only I have, this pulls all the registrationIDs of the database and sends the message to all of them. I know that there is a limitation of 1000 usersmessage but splitting one message into 3 should not be a problempli lipA backend server which offers multicast messages at least 100 push messagessecond.  This could work this way A user installs and starts my app in which I have integrated a registrationlogin for the backend service, he logs into his account and sends his GCM key to the backend server, which stores them. Everytime I post something on facebook, I ask the backend service to send a push message to all registrated users. The problem is that I only found provider who concentrate on sending single push messages and limit them to about 20 push messagessecond. I want it as simple and clean as possible for the user and an extra loginregistration on an backend server would bloat my app. If there is a backend which offers everything I said it shouldnt cost more than 5month, because the users should use my service for free. pli ulli ol  pCan these scenarions workp  pTo be honest, I dont think my two scenarios are that good.

It obviously is applicable for every type.p  pThe second part is a partial template specialization of codeIsIterablecode. Thanks to SFINAE, it is only chosen when codeTcode has the member functions codebegincode and codeendcode.p  pHere is my first question I just came up with actually the base template has a default argument, so this means it still has two template parameters. The partial specialization only has one template parameter. So does this mean that one template parameter always gets choosen embeforeem two template parameters, one defaultp  pAlso, do I understand it correctly that the first base template inherits from codefalsetypecode, and the partial template specialization adds another inheritance level so does the partial specializations inheritance hierarchy look like this codefalsetypecode  codetruetypecode  codeIsIterablecode, where the definitions of codefalsetypecode are hidden by codetruetypecodep  pNow onto my actual question. Why does the codedecltypecode expression have to evaluate to codevoidcode I thought that it wouldnt matter and I could write p  precodetemplate lttypename Tgt struct IsIterablelt         T,         decltype             stdbeginstddeclvalltstdaddlvaluereferencetltTgtgt,             stdendstddeclvalltstdaddlvaluereferencetltTgtgt,             bool   change here           gt  stdtruetype  codepre  pas well.

Negative 1289 pIm dealing with arduino mega based quadcopter and trying to make PWM frequency for 4 motors  400hz each.br Ive found an interesting solution where 4 ATmega2560 16bit timers are used to control 4 ESCs with PWM so it could reach 400hz frequency. 700 to 2000s are normal pulse widths ESC are dealing with.  br 1secREFRESHINTERVAL  10.0025  400hz.p  precodethis is servo.h lib define MINPULSEWIDTH       700      the shortest pulse sent to a servo   define MAXPULSEWIDTH      2000      the longest pulse sent to a servo  define DEFAULTPULSEWIDTH  1000      default pulse width when servo is attached define REFRESHINTERVAL     2500      minimum time to refresh servos in microseconds   define SERVOSPERTIMER       1      the maximum number of servos controlled by one timer  define MAXSERVOS   Nbr16timers   SERVOSPERTIMER codepre  pThe problem is to make it work each PWM should be controlled with 1 16bit timer. Otherwize, say, 2 escs on 1 timer would give 200hz. So all of 16bit timers are busy controlling 4 ESC but I still need to read input PPM from receiver. To do so I need at least one more 16bit timer which I dont have anymore.br Its still one 8bit timer free bit it can only read 0..255 numbers while normal number escs operate with are 1000..2000 and stuff.p  pSo what would happen if Ill use same 16bit timer for both pwm and ppm reading Would it work Would it decrease speed drasticallybr I have arduino working in pair with Raspberry Pi which controls data filtering, debugging, and stuff, is it better to move ppm reading to Raspberryp

Negative 1289 pI am new here, I hope I am doing this right.p  pI made a c application that computes MD5 hash digest for files following microsoft implementation in this link a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibrarywindowsdesktopaa38238028vvs.8529.aspx relnofollowhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibrarywindowsdesktopaa38238028vvs.8529.aspxa the case is the md5 hash digest is correct for any type file when comparing it with any ready tool that computes the md5 digest. except when the file in hands is an executable like cmd.exe. the hash digest is different and depends on the location of the exe. if you move the cmd.exe to another location then the digest becomes different again. so I went on implementing the same functionality using openssl library to face the same problem. I noticed that the hash digest from microsoft implementation and openssl is the same. so I think there is something missing in reading the file before passing it to compute the digest. but I searched alot to find nothing.

Negative 1289 pA common debugging technique for performance problems during development i.e. not in a production system is to randomly halt the program and inspect the stack.  If you see the same or similar stacks often, that is a clue that performance problems are caused by whatever is going on when the program is doing that.p  pI would like to do something similar in a production system, since there is information there that could be useful in fixing performance problems, if it could be nondestructively measured.p  pMy first thought was to send a UNIX signal to the processes in question.  A signal handler for that signal would then log the stack logging from a signal handler presents its own complications, but they could be worked around and are not really relevant to this question.p  pHowever, that is problematic because signals may cause system calls to be interrupted, which might break otherwise working production code, either by changing its behaviour or by degrading performance through retries.  I believe the Python standard library still does not handle EINTR correctly in many places, which aggravates this problem.p  pIs there a way to avoid these problems, partially or fully  The answer need not involve signals but Im not sure there is another way.  Note that part of the appeal of triggering the stack logging with a signal is that that should help reveal problems that occur as a result of IO, rather than only problems that result from excessive use of CPU time.p

I tried to remove this entries manually by going to WindowsODBC.INI but they are not there and this file seems to be only about the System32 odbc show belowp  precode[ODBC 32 bit Data Sources] Xtreme Sample Database 2008Microsoft Access Driver .mdb 32 bit PvdevOracle in OraClient11ghome1 32 bit ppmdevOracle in OraClient11ghome1 32 bit [Xtreme Sample Database 2008] Driver32CWindowssystem32odbcjt32.dll [Pvdev] Driver32CappXPTA559product11.2.0client64BINSQORA32.DLL [ppmdev] Driver32CappXPTA559product11.2.0client64BINSQORA32.DLL codepre  pAfter looking at this file I wondered why in the world the entries say Driver32 and 32 bit but were pointing at my 64 bit oracle folder, so I went to search on how to check oracle bitness and found out from a hrefhttpwww.dbaoracle.comtclient32bitor64bit.htm relnofollowherea thatp  pORACLEHOMElib      32 bitbr ORACLEHOMElib64   64 bitp  pOrp  pORACLEHOMElib      64 bitbr ORACLEHOMElib32   32 bitp  pand looking at my client64 oracle and client32 oracle folders, both have just lib, meaning, either i have installed 32 bit twice or i should check some other option unfortunatly, I deleted the original oracle files i downloaded because of space, ill download them again to check this.p  pAnyway, after all this I tryied to run my code again, only to get the error ORA12505 TNSlistener does not currently know of SID given in connect descriptor.p  pSearching for this I ended up looking at my tnsnames.ora files again, which both look like the followingp  precodePPMDEV    DESCRIPTION      ADDRESSLIST        ADDRESS  PROTOCOL  TCPHOST  10.163.148.11PORT  1524          CONNECTDATA        SID  PPMDEV         codepre  pnow... the tnsnames.ora seem ok both, one thing i notice is that, when i go to StartAll Programs, there is only one Oracle home1 and by the look of things i would say it is the one respective to client64 oracle folder installation.p  pnot wanting to make this even bigger and because im really confused, lost and tired, has anyone ever experience the same error and managed to get around it for OLEDB oracle providerp

Negative 1289 pI use html5 video tag to play video. Then I use canvas element to draw video frame.  Video is from remote source. There is no problem to draw frame. But there is problem to get image data from canvas. I want to get image data to make img element or to send data to server for creating image, but it is not possible, because operations with canvas are insecure. When I use video from same domain, there is no problem. Only one way, that i have found  is to make script on server, which get remote video and output it, and us this script like source for video element. But it is not very good idea, because it makes additional overload for server. I am not sure that i have understood properly articles about using crossorigin I think server, where remote video is located, has to send headers like AccessControlAllowOrigin  , but if I dont have access to that server, for example I want to user youtube video, there is no ability to execute to do itp

Negative 1289 pI was reading Uncle Bobs a hrefhttpbutunclebob.comArticleS.UncleBob.PrinciplesOfOod relnofollowblog about SOLID principlesa, especially his books excerpt about SRP  Single Responsability Principle, and trying to apply it using a real Console app.p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comkVe15.jpg altenter image description herep  pTo prove his point, Uncle Bob says  emIn .NET the GUI assembly would have to be built and deployed with the computational geometry application.em So we have to break Rectangle into two different entities, etc..p  pBut just to be sure, I wanted to test that statement and put each of these objects into their respective assembly.p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comafnSB.jpg altenter image description herep  pTo me, Uncle Bob means that if ComputationalGeometry is a console app, it should not run unless being put in the same directory as Rectangle.dll strongandstrong GUI.dll, right p  pIn fact though, my Computational Geometry Application is running perfectly fine without GUI.dll in the executables directory. It crashes without Rectangle.dll, which is obvious.

Negative 1289 pI am writing an input routine that requests a number between 1 and 30 from the user, and which is meant to emit an error message and reprompt the user for input until valid input is received. I used a loop to read the input and check it against various cases, exiting the loop once appropriate input is received.p  pThe case checking against whether the number is in range works or did work perfectly fine, but when I check to make sure that the user did not enter anything nonnumeric, the whole thing pretty much blows up in my face, and the loop seems to act weirdly. I was told at first it was an issue with not closing the input buffer so I added that fix, but then despite the condition being met the first time, it would not jump back to the front of the loop to allow the input to be altered  instead it would immediately jump to a branch and continually print that message on the order or thousands of times per second.p  pBelow is the code. The part that gets continually printed is the codeif isalphauNum ...code.  For this revision of my code, putting inputs above 30 and below 1 work just fine, but throwing in something like abc continually prints the message for going over 30 i.e. Value must be at most 30.... When I take out the statement to clear the buffer  codewhilegetchar  ncode  the aforementioned messages are constantly spammed without end. Can somebody help me out with why that is andor what I need to do to fix itp  precodeint getseedvoid      int uNum     printfPlease enter an integer between 1 and 30n     while1          scanfd,ampuNum         whilegetchar  n         if isalphauNum              printfYour entry must start with a digit try againn                  else if uNum lt 1  uNum gt 30              ifuNumlt1                 printfValue must be at least one try againn              else                  printfValue must be at most 30 try againn                          continue                  else             break          return uNum  codepre  pAt this point I am wondering if it would make more sense to simply change the else break statement which means the input was good to have a compound condition of lt30 and 1 so that a new else statement takes care of what the first if was supposed to do.p

Negative 1289 pI find that when I start a new project, specifically MVC 5, using the One ASP.NET wizardtemplates, I find myself running a few NuGet commands to update especially the script packages, e.g. jQuery, jQuery validate, and bootstrap.

My remaining solution is to automate the process of updating these NuGet packages.

Negative 1289 pI have one some questions about codeViewStubcode and performance in Android.   p  pLets assume that there three different types of views  Circle, Rectangle and Square views. I have custom compound view, and one of these three types should be added to the view hierarchy depending on attribute of custom compound view. So in this case I have only one way to do this  programmatically. As far as we need to add view in runtime there are several ways to do this.p  ol lipJust read attribute value, inflate one of three views and simply add it to the view hierarchywith setting some attributes of this view.     pli lipAnother way is to have codeViewStubcode in our compound view in and in this case we have different xml files with declaration of the three views circle,square,rect. Because we need to have id to pass to the view stub. And depending on attribute value of compound view in runtime setInflateResourceId and inflate view. This method returns us inflated view and we can cast it to appropriate view and do some stuff with this view.pli ol  pWhat method is the most correct and has better performance  Or maybe there is another way to implement this.p  pThank you.p

Negative 1289 pstrongBackgroundstrong I am writing a scripting language interpreter as a way to test out some experimental language ideas.  I am to the point of writing the core set of standard methods functions for builtin types.

It also disables all of the script after it since it isnt recognized. I feel like there has to be a simple reason for this. Do I have to do anything, in particular, to get this to work Its like the external js file isnt recognizing the php array, customArray, so its unable to convert it to the json array.p

If it is not trivially copyable, then it uses stack, not registers.p  pIt doesnt seem to be required to be a a hrefhttpen.cppreference.comwcppconceptStandardLayoutType relnofollowstandard layout typea nor a hrefhttpen.cppreference.comwcppconceptTrivialType relnofollowtriviala i.e. having a trivial default constructor in addition to being trivially copyable.p  pCan I count on this on all platforms or is this compiler dependentp  pWhat are the recommendations for a custom class in terms of the traits above, so that it is equivalent to raw pointers in terms of the generated assembly code when optimizations are onp  pThe actual codePtrltTgtcode class is implemented in a hrefhttptrilinos.org relnofollowTrilinosa in a hrefhttpsgithub.comtrilinostrilinosblob931fa121ce1d5e06585dae84891676a6f309b7a9packagesteuchoscoresrcTeuchosPtrDecl.hpp relnofollowTeuchosPtrDecl.hppa and a hrefhttpsgithub.comtrilinostrilinosblob931fa121ce1d5e06585dae84891676a6f309b7a9packagesteuchoscoresrcTeuchosPtr.hpp relnofollowTeuchosPtr.hppa. It has Debug and Release versions using ifdefs, the Debug version checks i.e. raises a nice exception for dangling pointers e.g. if you get a codePtrltTgtcode instance using codeRCPltTgtptrcode, where codeRCPcode is a reference counted pointer in Trilinos. In the Release mode, the codePtrltTgtcode should be as fast as a raw pointer, and thats what I am concerned about in this question. The idea is to test a code in Debug mode for all possible user input, and if it doesnt trigger any Debug exceptions, one then switches to the Release version with the same code for production runs and it has raw pointers performance.

Negative 1289 pIm trying to figure out if ConfigureAwaitfalse should be used on top level requests. Reading this post from a somewhat authority of the subject a hrefhttpblog.stephencleary.com201207dontblockonasynccode.htmlhttpblog.stephencleary.com201207dontblockonasynccode.htmlap  p...he recommends something like thisp  precodepublic async TaskltJsonResultgt MyControllerAction...      try              var report  await adapter.GetReportAsync         return Jsonreport, JsonRequestBehavior.AllowGet          catch Exception ex              return Jsonmyerror, JsonRequestBehavior.AllowGet   really slow without configure await        public async TaskltTodaysActivityRawSummarygt GetReportAsync                 var data  await GetData.ConfigureAwaitfalse      return data  codepre  pstrong...it says to using ConfigureAwaitfalse on every await emexceptem the top level call.strong emHowever when doing this my exception takes several seconds to return to the callerem vs. using it and it and having it come back right away. p  pWhat is the best practice for MVC controller actions that call async methods Should I use ConfigureAwait in the controller itself or just in the service calls that use awaits to request data, etc. If I dont use it on the top level call, waiting several seconds for the exception seems problematic. I dont need the HttpContext and Ive seen other posts that said always use ConfigureAwaitfalse if you dont need the context.p  pstrongUpdatestrong I was missing ConfigureAwaitfalse somewhere in my chain of calls which was causing the exception to not be returned right away. However the question still remains as posted as to whether or not ConfigureAwaitfalse should be used at the top level.p

Negative 1289 pSo Im making a web app that is sort of like adVenture Capitalist. My question is is there a way to have a function continuously running even when I close the webpage For example, lets say, I have 5 coins and there is a function that adds 5 coins every hour. I exit the page close the browser and return to that page 5 hours later. There would be 30 coins total from my initial coin value of 5 plus the 25 from the five hours.p  pI only know Javascript, HTML, PHP, and jQuery to some extent, so if you can please limit it to those languages. However if there are better or faster solutions using other languages please let me know. Thanks everyone p
Negative 1289 pSo I am using an Arduino Uno and pySerial to communicate with a PC using serial communication. My program is working, and once it initializes, it appears to work fast however, it takes the Arduino several seconds to begin acting on the code. I would not have a huge problem with this slow start, except it appears to put the rest of the code behind When I exit the program, the motors on my arduino keep running for several seconds. p  pIf a variable I am using changes chosen by the user, I want the Serial communication to immediately send the information to arduino and the arduino to act differently given the variable change, and I am concerned that it will not act immediatly.p  pOne thing which might be slowing down the initialization is this code p  pArduinop  precodevoid establishContact     while Serial.availablelt0          Serial.printA     delay300      codepre  pPythonp  precodefirstContact  False  inByte  ser.read1  while True     if firstContact  False         if inByte  bA              firstContact  True             ser.writea.encode codepre  pI used this to save time by not sending bytes on either side if one of the programs, Arduino or Python, is not ready to receive information. This was previously suggested to speed up run time, though I cant remember from who or where I read it. Is this slowing down my program or would you say it is useful p  pAnother potential way to speed up my code though I am again not sure if it will slow down or speed up is to check after each time I have sent information on each side whether the arduino is ready to again receive information, so that the arduino is not overloaded with information, which could slow it down. I believe my Python code is sending commands faster than the Arduino is enacting them.p  pI am using 9600 baud rate, would using a higher one help p  pI also have several embeded ifelifelif statements in my Python code, which I understand often slows code, but I have not been able to figure out a suitable replacement, and it also doesnt appear to be too much of a problem on the Python side.p  pWould clearing the serial buffer help The reason I ask this is because if I could work it correctly on the Arduino side, it could get rid of the build up of commands from Python, so even if the program initializes slowly, both programs are running synchronously, in real time. p  pThese are all suggestions I have picked up in different places, though I am not sure if they will help in my specific case.
