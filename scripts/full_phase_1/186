Positive 186 pI have NUnit test project in my solution. Id like to be able to run its tests on a set of different environments using a network of virtual machines and then aggregate result XMLs from each machine to my server. p  pI guess I would need to install NUnit to all my VMs in order to do it that way.

Negative 186 pI have a system where some loosely coupled components are communicating by exchanging messages over JMS. I am now looking at a new requirement which leads to some shared resource needing protection from access by two or more components at the same time more or less an instance of the readerwrite problem. I am looking for a way to coordinate access to the shared resource without adding too much additional complexity to the system. E.g. I wouldnt want to add a dedicated distributed lock manager to the mix if I dont have to.p  pI have a partial solution in my head which would use the JMS infrastructure as its base. Basically, sending lockmessages to queues. If there is a message in the writers queue, no one may post to that queue until the component that sent the message removes it again. Similarly, when a reader start reading the resource, they would send a message to the readers queue and remove it one they are done. A writer wouldnt start to write until it sees both the readers and the writers queue empty. A reader wouldnt start until it sees an empty writers queue.p  pOf course, I would need to find a way to synchronize the access to both queues so that a writer doesnt post to the writer queue while a reader posts to the reader queue that already saw the empty writer queue...p  pCan such a thing be pulled of with a reasonable amount of work Are there maybe existing implementations of a lock manager on top of JMS Any papers on the topic you would recommendp

Negative 186 pI have a 24bit bitmaps with R, G, B color channels and a 24bit bitmap with R, G, B alpha channels. I want to alpha blend the first bitmap to a HDC in GDI or RenderTarget in Direct2D with the alpha channels respectively. For example, suppose for one pixel, the bitmap color is 192, 192, 192, the HDC color is 0, 255, 255 and the alpha channels are 30, 40, 50. The final HDC color should be 22, 245, 242. I know I can BitBlt the HDC to a memory HDC first, do alpha blending by manually calculating the color of each pixel and finally BitBlt back. I just want to avoid the additional blitting and leave APIs do their job faster since they are in kernel space.p  pThe first idea comes to my mind is to split the source bitmap into 3 redonly, greenonly and blueonly 8bit bitmaps, do normal alpha blending, then composite the 3 output bitmaps into the HDC. But I dont find a way to do the splitting and composition natively in Windows would Direct2D layer help. Also, the splitting and compositing may require many additional copying. The performance overhead would be too high.p  pOr maybe do the alpha blending in 3 passes. Each pass apply the blending for one channel, while maintaining the other 2 unchanged.p  pThanks for any comment.p  pEDIT I found this a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions2818351percomponentalphachannelswithopenglquestiona, and the answer should be good reference to this problem. However, besides ACSRCOVER, there is no other blending operation supported. Why dont Microsoft improve their APIp

By default, the firefox began playing the wav file 5 seconds behind, but I could advance playback by setting audio.currentTime ahead, and only be 12 seconds back somewhat fragile.  However, Id much prefer to use icecast, and streaming wavs obviously doesnt scale.p  pThanks in advance for any ideas.p

The jsonReader below is one of many Ive tried and in the function callbacks I can log the specific values Im receiving back so I know Im getting the data.  p  pWhat is the proper way for me to get the JSON specified below loaded into the jqGrid  p  pHeres the relevant codep  pstrongHTMLstrongp  precodeltdiv iddataInfogt     lttable iddataTablegtlttablegt     ltdiv iddataTablePagergtltdivgt ltdivgt codepre  pstrongJSstrongp  precodejQuerydataTable.jqGrid               url httpltsnipgt,               mtype GET,               datatype json,               jsonReader                    root ipResponses,                   id startIP,                   repeatitems false,                   page  functionobj  return 1 ,                   total functionobj  return 1 ,                   records functionobj  return obj.ipInfo.ipResponses.length ,                   userdata userData               ,               colNames [StartIP, EndIP],               colModel [                                          name startIP,                       index startIP,                       width 55                   ,                                           name endIP,                       index endIP,                       width 55                                  ],               pager dataTablePager,               rowNum 8,               rowList [25,50,100],               sortname startIP,               sortorder asc,               viewrecords true,               caption Data,               pgtextPage 0            codepre  pstrongJSONstrongp  precode     ipInfo           queryStartIP 4.4.4.0,          queryEndIP 4.4.4.256,          ipResponses [              startIP 4.4.4.1, endIP 4.4.4.5,              startIP 4.4.4.10, endIP 4.4.4.15         ]       codepre

Negative 186 pSetting the 32nd and 64th bits is tricky.p  h232bit Solutionh2  pI got it to work for 32bit fields.  The trick is to cast the return value of the POWER function to binary4 before casting it to int.  If you try to cast directly to int, without first casting to binary4, you will get an arithmetic overflow exception when operating on the 32nd bit index 31.  Also, you must ensure the expression passed to POWER is of a sufficiently large type e.g. bigint to store the maximum return value 231, or the POWER function will throw an arithmetic overflow exception.p  precodeCREATE FUNCTION [dbo].[SetIntBit]       bitfieldvalue int,     bitindex int, 0 to 31     bit bit 0 or 1  RETURNS int AS BEGIN     DECLARE bitmask int  CASTCASTPOWERCAST2 as bigint,bitindex as binary4 as int     RETURN     CASE         WHEN bit  1 THEN bitfieldvalue  bitmask         WHEN bit  0 THEN bitfieldvalue amp bitmask         ELSE bitfieldvalue NO CHANGE     END END codepre  hr  h264bit Problemh2  pI was going to use a similar approach for 64bit fields, however Im finding that the POWER function is returning inaccurate values, despite using the decimal38 type for the expressionreturn value. For example select POWERCAST2 as decimal38, 64 returns 18446744073709552000 only the first 16 digits are accurate rather than the correct value of 18446744073709551616.  And even though Id only raise 2 to the 63rd power, that result is still inaccurate.p  pThe documentation of the POWER function indicates that Internal conversion to float can cause loss of precision if either the money or numeric data types are used. note that numeric type is functionally equivalent to decimal type.p  pI think the only way to handle 64bit fields properly is to operate on their 32bit halves, but that involves an extra check on the bitindex property to see which half I need to operate on.  Are there any builtin function or better ways to explicitly set those final bits in 32bit and 64bit bitmasked fields in TSQLp

Negative 186 pSo i am creating a class for MiniString which is just full of instance methods for the object MiniString, every MiniString has an instance variable that is a char[]. When testing my methods, I cant find where I am going wrong with my substring method. There are two substring methods where one takes a parameter of int and the other takes two int parameters. I keep getting the error on the one int parameter method. The substring method is supposed to return a new MiniString formed of the characters between the position in the target Ministring specified by the int parameter, and the end of the target MiniString.

Negative 186 pI searched and googled for an answer but couldnt find one.p  pBasically Im developing a webcamaudio streaming application which should capture audio and video from a pc usb webcammicrophone and send them to a receiving server. What the server will do with that its another story and phase two which Im skipping for nowp  pI wrote some code using DirectShow and Windows Media Format and it worked great for capture audiovideo and sending them to another client, but theres a major problem latency.p  pEverywhere in the internet everyone gave me the same answer sorry dude but media format isnt for video conferencing, their codecs have too high latency. I thought I could skip the .wmv problems but seems like its not possible to do... this road ends here then.p  pSo I saw a few examples with DirectShow.NET which were faster for both audio and video.. my question is how come that DirectShow.NET is faster and better for videoaudio conferencing Shouldnt it be just a .NET porting of Cs DirectShowp  pAm I missing something Im a bit confused at this pointp

The parorama pages bakedin animations let the title slide in, and also the panorama items slide into place. So, there are some translationanimations running parallel to my page transitions which are basically rotation and opacity. Can I somehow prevent the panorama from playing its own animations, or delay them until my page transition animation has completed, respectivelyp  pThere is another problem with my page transitions When I navigate to another page and play the animation, when the animation has completed LayoutRoot has been rotated to Y70, and its opacity0 then the original layout is displayed for a few miliseconds with LayoutRoot rotation Y0 and opacity1, and then it is navigating to the next page and the animation on the next page starts. Why is thisp  pI hope, someone can help me. Im quite frustrated after having spent so many hours on this. Regardless of what I tried, the animations showed bad performance, they are stuttering in the Emulator and on the Device.  The animations of the preinstalled apps on the phone have smooth animations.

Negative 186 pMy simulation model contains agents on a surface. Agents are represented by codeclass Agentcode, their locations by codeclass Pointcode, and the surface itself by codeclass Surfacecode. Each point is really just a pair of numbers.p  pTo model an agents movement, I need to know which surface hes on e.g., on a torus, he would never hit a lands end, but on a cylinder, he will.p  pMy question is whether I should add to codeclass Pointcode, as an instance attribute, a reference to the codeSurfacecode object.p  pIf I do, codeclass Pointcode becomes more complicated, and efficiency suffers instead of dealing with pairs of numbers, Ill be dealing with pairs of numbers plus a reference. This is especially annoying since theres only one instance of codeclass Surfacecode ever instantiated in a single program run.p  pIf I dont, I would not be able to give codeclass Agentcode a codemovecode method. Instead Id have to model agents movement from an outer class that is aware of both the surface and individual agents. This approach seems logically less appealing.p

Connectors act like wires between components, making it simple and intuitive to express detailed structures that are dicult or impossible in other approaches such as dependency injection. Resemblance and evolution These two constructs provide unprecedented levels of support for component reuse.   Resemblance     is a form of component inheritance.

That wouldnt disable change tracking, and AFAICT Id have to loop through all the entity sets on context instance creation to mark them all as readonly although thats a perf issue so not as critical as just making sure changes dont persist.p  pCertainly theres other options like having the connection string connect as a user that only has read access, but I wonder what options are available from an EF designermodelinstance perspective for having readonly object contextsp

Negative 186 pIm developing a usermode Ring3 codelevel debugger. It should be able to read and use the debugging information from the .pdb files.p  pProcessing of static variables is easy. But when dbghelp.dll reports arguments and locals of some procedure, it returns offsets from the real frame pointer realvirtual EBP. For analysis, I need offsets from the virtual frame pointer location of return address on the stack.

The real frame pointer of a procedure is the contents of the stack pointer after the size of the fixed part of the stack frame has been subtracted from the virtual frame pointer. As far as I understand, usually, but emnot alwaysem, real FP  virtual FP. Is there a secure way to convert between real and virtual FP using only the information delivered by the dbghelp.dllp  pOllyp

Negative 186 pSorry about the vague question title, I just want to ascertain some things.p  pStatic libraries dont link with other static libraries, right p  pSo when I write a slib A, that uses functionality of another B, all I have to provide are the headers of B to A, and only those, even if A actually uses functionality from B Yesp  pAs long as exe X, which uses A,has B.lib specified as linker inputp  pSo that at link time, the linker takes A.lib, which basically only knows that a function of B was called somewhere inside its code, and somehow fills that information from B.lib, making A.lib whole, before X gets linked with the now working parts of itp  pThe motivation behind these questions is to get rid of some linker warnings 4006 and discarded double definitions, and I think that should do the trick, if this is actually a valid way of doing it.p

Negative 186 pstrongThe situationstrong I have a Grails webpage with two tables. One table displays a persons information including certain flags, and the second table has a list of flags with an add button that allows the user to add a given flag to themselves.p  pNow, there is a save button that, when clicked, pushes the current state of the users flags to our database. So I want to be able to display a prompt if there is unsaved information being displayed when a user tries to navigate to another part of the site. This is easy enough by using an existing isDirty boolean that each flag stores. I can just loop through the persons active flags and check if it is dirty or not. If the person contains at least 1 dirty flag, I need to display a prompt if they try to leave, because that data wont be saved unless they explicitly hit the button.p  pstrongThe problemstrong There are many ways to navigate away from this page. I am using  codeltbody onbeforeunloadcheckForDirtyFlagsgtcode, where checkForDirtyFlags is a basic js function to check for any dirty flags. But heres the thing  when a user adds or removes a flag, that causes a page reload because the way the page is setup is to redirect to a url like this p  precodehttpmy.urladdFlag123456 codepre  pThe controller then knows to add the flag with id 123456 to the current person. This does NOT change where the person is in the website however, because the same page is still rendered it just contains updated tables. So basically, when I see a URL with addFlag or removeFlag, I do not want to prompt the user if they are sure they want to navigate away from the page, because in the eyes of the user they are not leaving the page. p  pstrongThe questionstrong Is there any way to determine what the target is during an codeonbeforeunloadcode So that I can have something like this in my javascriptp  precodefunction checkForDirtyFlag      if justAdding   We are just adding a flag.

Negative 186 pIm working on some code to work with a set of events. These events can be persisted in different ways, based upon their concrete type. I currently have the iEvent interface abstracting the events, the iBackend interface for each of the ways they can be persisted, and a set of small interfaces iFileEvent, iDBEvent, etc for each backend that defines conversion methods to the serialisation representation required from the event itself. Each concrete event class implements iEvent and whatever combination of capability interfaces it supports.p  pThis all works fine when deserialising as this is performed by the backend implementations file, db, etc, so they know what concrete event types to create from their existing contents, and thus can use the concrete event classs public methods to create them. I am however now at the point where I need to serialise new events, and have a bit of a quandary.p  pThe problem is that Im not providing the concrete type to each backend, as they only get given an iEvent due to the iBackend interface.p  pI can throw in a dynamiccast, or I can just use a rtti comparison or a cheaper version thereof and a staticcast, but Im not sure of theres a better method for capabilityquerying, and I dont see a clean way of solving this with any of those suggestions.p  pMy specific case of desiring conversions between the concrete event type and the data structures used to persist them in each backend could be implemented by a set of methods in the backend for each type of event, but I dont like that at all...but a set of conversion decorators for each combination of class and backend smells like a nasty case of class explosion as well.p  pSeems pointless adding classes when all I need is the event classes to state they support the interface for each backend...which leads me to think that the casting options are the only way forward.p  pSo in summary, Im looking for advice on better solutions to this.p

Here is what Im doingp  p1 Set up a local server with a database of users username and password columns and other tables etc. using mysql.  Wrote a simple webservice that takes in POST data and queries the database to check that the username exists... and if it does, that the passwords are equal.  Using sha1 hashing.  Echo true or false accordingly.  p  p2 My app has an initial login screen with a 2 textfields 1 for username and 1 for password and a button that calls the login method.  My login method does the followingp  ul liinit an NSURL with a string the url of my web service httpwebservice.comlogin.phpli liinit an ASIFormDataRequst with that urlli liset the post value with the password and email text in the text fieldsli liset the delegate to itselfli licall startAsycronous on the requestli liimplemented the requestFininshed method to retrieve the true or false echoed from the webserviceli lidepending on the response, move forward to the next view, else, make an alert telling the user to retryli ul  pSo, my questions arep  p1 Is this secure for sending passwords  via ASIHTTPRequest and the POST method 2 In the succeeding views, the user should be able to interact with their account like posting messages and statuss and pictures on the Facebook  How do I persist the users logged in status so that every time the user interacts with the database, I can ensure that the user is still logged in and that its the same user  For instance, the only way I can think of doing this is if I store a cookie on the users device with the username and password, and then every successive interaction with the web service  database, it does an authentication with the cookie values username and password.  p  pThere has got  to be a better way of doing this  Maybe sessions or cookies  or by using keychainp  pThanks for the help guys, and sorry for the long questionp  hr

Negative 186 pI have a html layout done using absolutely positioned div elements and a backgroung image. I want to keep the layout the same vertically each individual partpage representing a data set. I do not want to change the div positioning from absolute as this messes up things and I am running out of time for this.p  pI realize I can have multiple body tags each for every data set and as this html will finally be generated from xml using xslt this is not a problem.p  pThe issue is that as the div elements are absolute they do not appear in the subsequent body tag only background image appears. I tried changing to relative and the div actually moves to next page body element, but as there are several divs, when all are laid out they get misaligned.p  pI will be grateful for some advice on how to tackle this either by fixing my html in some way that will not be too time consuming or by using a tool that can combine several html content in to one flowing page. Any other piece of advice is also very welcome.p

Basically, I manually handle fetching correct sizes  colors in the setMake method, and correct colors in the setSize method, and then set the necessary changes on the model.p  precodevar designid  2  set serverside  var ConfigModel  Backbone.Model.extend      initialize function       this.baseUrl  designs  designid  configure     ,      setMake functionmakeid       var me  this       var make  .findthis.getmakes, functionel                    return el.id  makeid         aggregate changes to the model                var changes           make make               get current makesizecolor       var curmakeid  make.id       var cursizeid  this.getsize.id       var curcolorid  this.getcolor.id         get sizes for the current make       .getJSONme.baseUrl  makes  curmakeid  sizes,            functiondata             changes.sizes  data             if.finddata, functionel                    return el.id  cursizeid               the currently selected size is not available,               so use the first size             changes.size  data[0]             cursizeid  changes.size.id                     and get the colors for the current make and size         .getJSONme.baseUrl  makes  curmakeid                  sizes  cursizeid  colors,              functiondata                changes.colors  data                if.finddata,                        functionel                           return el.id  curcolorid                             the currently selected color                             is not available,                            so use the first one in the list                      changes.color  data[0]                                         me.setchanges                                ,      setSize functionsizeid        retrieve colors for the new size       var me  this       var size  .findthis.getsizes,                functionel return el.id  sizeid        var changes           size size               var curmakeid  this.getmake.id       var cursizeid  size.id       var curcolorid  this.getcolor.id        .getJSONme.baseUrl  makes  curmakeid                   sizes  cursizeid  colors,           functiondata              changes.colors  data              if.finddata,                  functionel                    return el.id  curcolorid               changes.color  data[0]                      me.setchanges            ,      setColor functioncolorid       var color  .findthis.getcolors,               functionel                  return el.id  colorid        this.setcolor color         codepre  pHeres the model instance.

Negative 186 pOk so here is what is happeningp  pI have a client that I am building an application for. My client has a flowchart that they would like posted on the front page of their application. Check. My client then wants this flowchart to be set up as an image map so that a user could click one of the boxes in this flowchart and be taken to a report in another part of the application. Check.p  pAll of that is elementary and, in a technical sense, works. The issue is, and it is an issue I have encountered before with APEX, is that every time a user clicks one of these links it takes them to the login screen. It seems that linking directly to a pages URL breaks the session and requires you to login again, even if you are linking from one page in the application to another in the same application. p  pI have played with all of the authentication settings in a hopes of fixing this and tried to determine what is breaking the session exactly but with no luck.p  pHas anyone else had this problem and could share their method for fixing it I really cant have users logging in every time they click a link and I also cannot simply remove the authentication on the pages. Thanks in advance.p

Negative 186 pI am trying to prevent fraud in a webproject I am building. The project is a game which includes multiple websites.p  pEach website does a ajax check for with each pageview to a webpage on my server for a status update of the game. The response page, lets say www.domain.comresponse.cfm it is coldfusion normally returns nothing, but at a certain point of time within the games timeframe, it will display a JSON string with information.  This information is then used by the script that is included on the websites.p  pSo website A has been viewed 100 times all of its pages, which will generate 100 ajax calls.p  pThe problem I have is that a robot could check the ajax destination too, and much faster. Now I can detect a robot, or could make it difficult for him by using a session or checking for cookies, BUT...p  pthe biggest issue is that I found out you can do a lot in the Firebug script console, or the Safari console. Probably Chrome too.p  pWith this console, they can even evade the crossdomain restriction. I created a simple script that does a couple of calls to the Ajax page and when I go to the same domain first, and then use the console...there is no crossdomain limitation. And you execute all kind of javascript, so in essence someone like me could commit fraud in the game by using the javascript console which masks him as regular browser user. p  pMy question now is Does anyone know how to prevent this I tried to disable the usage of the console but I dont think I can. It may be possible to detect if the console is active and then disable MY scripts so the game doesnt work. But I think they can load the script source in the console manually and then the game does work.p  pLooks like console is a beautiful thing, but a nightmare for me now to prevent people cheating in the game I am creating.p  pHope anyone has suggestions.p  pps of course I am trying to implement som server side checks to detect cheating, but most of the time it is not realtime. HR UPDATE 1932012 HR The fraud that I am trying to prevent is cheating in the game by polling the page that generates logic for the next step of the game. This is a serverscript page which generates json code which will trigger a change on the website the game is played on. For your information, websites the are involved have a script in there header, like google analytics, so they will communicate with my server every pageview.p  pPolling that serverpage can reveal information which will gain the cheaters knowledge or progress.p  pSo i have to prevent people from getting knowledge ahead of other earnest players by monitoring the serverpage which will reveal information at a certain time. I dont want them auto polling it and when info is revealed, the send themselves a notifcation and check the website.p  pSo what I will do is make sure that if people have to many pageviews per second, they are blocked. Plus you need a cookie to be able to join in and you only get a cookie by logging in. Hopefully this will give me enough tools to make it as robust as possible.p  pThanks for all your knowledge, people.p

All good.p  pBut my business user wants like, if he tabs from previous control to this textbox, and supposing they want to change the digits after the decimal point alone in the above example i.e 39 they want to tab and just keyin so that it will only be overwrited with a new value and the value 22223 will stay still. They should be able to back front and back again.p  pi.e its like, in simple words, if the user tabs within a textbox, it should first go to the number field and highlight the number In above example it should highlight 22223 and then if the user again presses tab, it should go and highlight the digits after decimal In above example 39. I am unsure how to do it. And, if the user again presses the tab for 3rd time, it should move to the next controltextboxAsusual.p  pBut I got idea of keeping 2 textboxes, which is silly. I want exact same functionality what I mentioned and only in textbox and its C Winform app.p  pAlso I dont need the numeric updown control which has got some limitations wrt our requirement.p

Negative 186 pI am using a C .NET 2.0 winform in 2010, I have added the ability for a user to log in and post comments. I copied the .NET developer guide in how to post comments but I am getting random but frequent exceptions when trying to post comments. At first I thought it might be because there is some issue with using a google email instead of the youtube log in name, to get around this when a user succesfully logs in I request the profile, get the user name and create a new youtube settings class and give the appropriate credentials with the users profile name. This however hasnt resolved the issue, the comments still work sporadically.

Negative 186 pI am trying to implement a macro which will allow me to run several logistic regression models that have the same outcome but a different main explanatory variable the covariates would be common for all models for several datasets. I have written a scan and eval macro that scans two global variables but its not quite working. The code is shown belowp  precodelet numbers5 7 8 9 10 12 13 14 16 18 19 24  26  32 33  35 37  39  41  44 45  48 50 52  55 56  58  66 67 68    let listvoting national local safe street violence say free  macro logistic     let j1 let m1 let firstscanamplist,evalampj let secondscanampnumbers,evalampm do while ampfirst ne  do while ampsecond ne   proc logistic datasocialcapitalampsecond. descending model depression ampfirst. agec married edu inc2 inc3 inc4 inc5risklimits ods output ParameterEstimatesmvmodel1ampsecond.ampfirst. run  let jevalampj1 let mevalampm1 let firstscanamplist,evalampj let secondscanampnumbers,evalampm  end end run  mend   logistic codepre  pThe global variable numbers refers to the socialcaptial dataset that I am using. Each dataset represents a country and so each number in the numbers global variable refers to a dataset. The global variable list refers to the list of main explanatory variables that I want to include in the model, one main explanatory variable per model. What I am looking to get is 8 separate multivariable logistic regression results for each country. p  pHowever, it appears that the scan function is not working properly for me so I know that I have done something wrong, but I am not sure what. It seems that the macro assigns 1 variable from amplist to 1 dataset from ampnumbers until it runs out of variables from amplist and simply runs the model with just the covariates instead of running all 8 models using the dataset 5, then running all 8 models again using dataset 7, and so forth. p  pBasically, I have messed up something with the numbering and I am not quite sure how to proceed with this macro. I know that I can get rid of the ampnumbers global variable by using a by statement in proc logistic with a stacked dataset but I would really like to learn how to get this to work for future models where that might not be an option.p

Negative 186 pIm making a simple control based on a codeTScrollingWinControlcode and code copied from a codeTScrollBoxcode with a codeTImagecode control. I somewhat got the zooming to work, but it doesnt necessarily zoom to a focused point  the scrollbars dont change accordingly to keep the center point in focus.p  pI would like to be able to tell this control codeZoomToconst X, Y, ZoomBy Integercode to tell it where to zoom the focus to. So when it zooms, the coordinates I passed will stay centered. At the same time, I also need to have a codeZoomByconst ZoomBy Integercode which tells it to keep it centered in the current view.p  pFor example, there will be one scenario where the mouse is pointed at a particular point of the image, and when holding control and scrolling the mouse up, it should zoom in focused on the mouse pointer. On the other hand, another scenario would be sliding a control to adjust the zoom level, in which case it just needs to keep the center of the current view not necessarily center of the image focused.p  pThe problem is my math gets lost at this point, and I cant figure out the right formula to adjust these scroll bars.

Negative 186 pbTLDRb In Java, will casting a character obtained from a String via the codecharAtcode method to a byte always yield the same valuebr br I am reading files which are encoded with arbitrary unknown to us character encodings. I need to parse these files and look for certain words, e.g. TAG. I placed certain restrictions on the file contents, such as when looking for a tag, the bytes for TAG must be the same as their ASCII representation.br br For example, suppose I have the following filebr code0x00 0x11 0x22 0x33 0x54 0x41 0x47 0x77 0x88 0x99 0xaa 0xbbcodebr Since the ASCII values for T, A and G are respectively code0x54code, code0x41code and code0x47code, I can find TAG in the file by parsing the bytes themselves.br code0x00 0x11 0x22 0x33codebcode0x54 0x41 0x47codebcode0x77 0x88 0x99 0xaa 0xbbcodebr br However, I need to hardcode the value of the bytes I am looking for. To do this, I call codeStringcodes codecharAtint icode method and cast the char to a byte.br br Here is, for example, how I would verify an arbitrary byte called codebcode for the byte representation of Tbr codeString tag  TAGcodebr codechar t  tag.charAt0codebr codeif bytet  bcodebr nbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspcodemagic goes here, such as comparing the A and the Gcodebr codecodebr iNote the code is not actually like that, and the verification algorithm is much more elegant.ibr br This works fine on my local machine. However, this will be run on machines which may contain very strange encodings. What worries me is whether casting a character obtained with codecharAtcode to a byte might yield a different value depending on the machine. I know that Java always encodes codecharcodes with the UTF16 character encoding, but I am worried that when converting from a String to a character and then to a byte might yield strange results.br br So, in short, will casting a character obtained from a String via the codecharAtcode method to a byte always yield the same value Or will it depend on an external factorbr br Thanks for your helpbr br ibNoteb I cannot hardcode the bytes themselves in, for example, a byte array since they can be very very long and may be changed very often in the future.ip

Except for my trying to figure out which of the multitude of classes and interfaces that were generated from the wsdl to make the service reference I should use in place of the MyService, above.p  pMy first try was to use TheirWebservicePortTypeClient  the class I had instantiated in the previous version.  That gave me a runtime errorp  precodeThe type argument passed to the generic ChannelFactory class must be an interface type. codepre  pSo I dug into the generated code, a bit more.  I saw thisp  precodepublic partial class TheirWebservicePortTypeClient      System.ServiceModel.ClientBaseltTheirWebservicePortTypegt,      TheirWebservicePortType      ...  codepre  pSo I tried instantiating ChannelFactorylt with TheirWebservicePortType.p  pThis gave me compiletime errors.  The resulting proxy didnt have a ClientCredentials member, or a TheirOperation method.p  pSo I tried System.ServiceModel.ClientBase.p  pInstantiation ChannelFactorylt with it still gave me compiletime errors.  The resulting proxy did have a ClientCredentials member, but it still didnt have a TheirOperation method.p  pSo, what gives  How do I pass a usernamepassword to an HTTPS webservice, from a WCF clientp  p Edited to explain the solution  p  pFirst, as suggested, instantiation the factory with TheirWebservicePortType, adding the username and password to the factory.Credentials, instead of to proxy.ClientCredentials worked fine.  Except for one bit of confusion.p  pMaybe its something to do with the odd way the wsdl is written, but the client class, TheirWebservicePortTypeClient, defined TheirOperation as taking a Request argument and returning a Response result. The TheirWebservicePortType interface defined TheirOperation as taking a TheirOperationInput argument and returning a TheirOperationOutput result, where TheirOperationInput contained a Request member and TheirOperationOutput contained a Response member.p  pIn any case, if I constructed a TheirOperationInput object from the passed Request, the call to the proxy succeeded, and I could then extract the contained Response object from the returned TheirOperationOutput objectp  precodeTheirOperationOutput output  client.TheirOperationnew TheirOperationInputrequest TheirWebserviceResponse response  output.TheirWebserviceResponse codepre

Negative 186 pIm writing a custom Loader for pig. It is supposed to read delimited records that might span into multiple lines.

Negative 186 pI am interested in implementing a user interface navigation control mechanism based on a wheel shaped device or pie chart shaped or circle shaped in my Android app.p  pI would like only half of the wheel to be visible at any time. That is, only the top half of the wheel should be visible since the bottom half should be below the border of the screen. The user can then turn the half wheel to show options hidden by the screen border. The visible top half should then be divided into three parts like a pie chart, so the user can press either one of them to invoke some action. The following pic should explain it is an example with seven AG options.p  pa hrefhttpimgur.comlNu1F relnofollowhttpimgur.comlNu1Fap  pThe rotation itself should not be hard, but I am having a hard time understanding how to position the wheel so that half of it is outside the actual screen. I am thinking that loading the entire wheel but hiding half of it is best, since that is that graphics I have and it will also allow a smooth animation when the user swipes to show some other options. How can I make Android show the wheel in this wayp  pAlso. Any comment on how to implement the swipe along the wheel shape would be appreciated.p  pThank you.p

The application reads about 53,000 lines of delimited records, parses each row, and then proceeds to send each row to the database to be written.

Negative 186 pIf I save a phpexcel document in Excel5 format that contains values only, people that reference the document can open and close it without issue.p  pBut if I put some formulas in cells, I have two undesired outcomes.p  pJust before saving the document I set the column widths based on the contents of the columns. Since the formulas have not been calcuated, the columns appear to be only as large as the largest single value in the column so the width is set too narrow. Once the sum formulas are calculated after being opened in excel, the contents overflow the cell width and display as a string of .p  pThe second effect is that when the total is calculated by excel, the book is marked as modified by excel. When the user attempts to exit the book, they are prompted to see if they want to save their changes. This is disconcerting because in their mind they have not changed anything and annoying because it is an interuption that they really dont want to contend with.p  pI have been searching the documentation.

Negative 186 pIve been searching arround StackOverflow but seems I cant find the exact explanation for my problemp  pI am running a GUI Application compiled under Visual Studio 2012. As it is a GUI application, sometimes its quite hard to Debug it normally, so I need to printout some values while executing. Ive done a couple of printf but the problem is that, as it is a GUI application there is no Console available while debugging it. I need to debug and have a Console to display these output values from printf. I know under CodeBlocks it is possible to do so, however the project is quite big to have to migrate everything to gcc CodeBlocks.p  pCould anyone tell me how to display such console or how to workaround the problem and have a similar resultp  pThank you very muchp

It has been set by Automatic Profile Selector  IPhone Developer and matches myself for Myapp, and is set for Debug  Any SDK and Release  Any iOS SDK.p  pstrongAre you using the full product ID when when making an SKProductRequeststrong br Yes, I am using com.mydomain.Myapp.fullversion.p  pstrongHave you waited several hours since adding your product to iTunes Connectstrong br Yes, I have waited 24 hours.p  pstrongAre your bank details active on iTunes Connectstrong br Yes they are.p  pstrongHave you tried deleting the app from your device and reinstallingstrong br Many times.p  pAn observation here On the test device, I am not logged in to iTunes amp App Stores and when I run the app from Xcode on the test device it has not asked me to log in I have a test user set up in iTunes Connect and ready to use.  So my app runs, calls start on SKProductRequest but never prompts me to log in to iTunes amp App Stores.p  pMany thanks in advance. I hope someone can help me to get InApp purchases working.

Negative 186 pI am using simplehtmldom on a webpage of mine to save 3 separate pages and search and print various things within those pages.

Is there some way I can get Linq to Entities to select the field as a Base64 string before it gets serialisedp  pMy solution is a dirty looking JavaScript function to convert 8 field byte arrays to Base64 strings, but this is not pretty and I would rather the original Json request return the field already encoded. Everything I have tried gives me an unsupported Linq to Entities function exception. I dont want to do it in memory, I would like to find some sort of Entities.Functions style of getting it to happen on the SQL server.p  pAnother way I wouldnt mind doing it is if could get jQuery to post the save request in some way that would bind an 8 field byte array to a byte[] back in the model but everything I have tried doesnt work. I have tried all the traditional true and contentType applicationjson charsetutf8 on the post with no success like with other actions that bind an array in an Ajax post successfully. It just doesnt seem to work like with other arrays as the model binder seems to be expecting a Base64 string rather than a byte array for byte[] fields on the model.p

In other words, the nested lists dont work at all.p  pThe second option in the aforementioned solution is what I went with. It seemed the simplest and clearest to me. Is there a relatively easy way to apply it to nested sortables   p

Negative 186 pI am using the a hrefhttpfreeimage.sourceforge.net relnofollowFreeImagea library to store and manipulate bitmap data. Part of my code requires me to take a screenshot of a window in Windows, and store it as a codeFBITMAPcode FreeImages bitmap data structure. The method I have worked out of doing this involves two steps capture the image, then convert it to a codeFBITMAPcode.p  pTo capture the image, I do something like thisp  precodeHWND window  Assume this is a valid handle to my window int width  width of window client area int height  height of window client area  HDC windowDC  GetDCwindow HDC captureDC  CreateCompatibleDCwindowDC HBITMAP screenshot  CreateCompatibleBitmapwindowDC, width, height SelectObjectcaptureDC, screenshot BitBltcaptureDC, 0, 0, width, height,         captureDC, 0, 0, SRCCOPYCAPTUREBLT  ReleaseDCwindow, windowDC DeleteDCcaptureDC codepre  pFreeImage provides a function which returns a raw pointer to the pixel datap  pcodeBYTE FreeImageGetBitsFBITMAPcodep  pa hrefhttpfreeimage.sourceforge.netfaq.html relnofollowThe FAQa explains that a codeHBITMAPcode WinAPI handle to a bitmap can be converted to a codeFBITMAPcode using codeGetDIBitscode, which takes a source codeHBITMAPcode and a destination raw pointer as arguments, and copies the pixel data from one to the other.p  pThe problem with this approach is that I have copied the data twice  once in the codeBitBltcode from the window DC to the codeHBITMAPcode selected in the memory DC, and then again from the codeHBITMAPcode to the FreeImage memory buffer. I wish to remove this inefficiency and copy the data directly to my raw pointer in the codeBitBltcode operation. For this to work, I need a memory DC which has a codeHBITMAPcode selected into it, and where that codeHBITMAPcode points to my memory buffer instead of to memory that Windows allocated for it.p  pHow can I achieve thisp

Negative 186 pIm looking for a solution to an issue with storing data. let me explain.p  pIve written a browser plugin which positions elements on specific pages. when the element is clicked it opens an iFrame which connects to a facebook app, pulls some details and stores some data on a mysql database.p  pthat all works great because the iframe is from my url so it is allowed to connect to facebook.p  pNow my issuep  pI need to be able to store a time value using javascript before the element is clicked.p  ul lipi would use local storage but thats specific to the url youre on. I need to be able to access the stored time value upon any url since the plugin is called and loads a .js file onto every website.pli lipthen i tried connecting to facebook, pulling the users ID, connecting to mysql and storing it their relative to the user ID. That doesnt work since facebook wont let me connect to its server when im outside the specified url for the app and thus i cant get user ID.pli lipi would store it on the iframe when its clicked, but i need access to it before its clicked.pli lipthen i thought what if i loaded an invisible iFrame onto the webpage, and either stored it in local storage specific to my Url, or use the iframe to pull the facebook ID  and check on  the mysql database. no, since i cant access the iframe outside of the iframe and thus use information on the plugin data. hmmpli lipthen i thought about storing the data within the app itself, like in chromes content.js. thats cool, but this extension will be converted to firefox, safari and windows using www.crossrider.com. amazing site btw. thus im not sure if its possible.pli ul  pAny solutions Either to store values across domains, or access facebook api across domains or somethingp  paaaggghh. thanks p

Negative 186 pIm pretty new to vba. I have managed to make some codes work by copying from this site and editing them into my purpose, but this one is just too hard to crack have tried to solve this for a couple of days now.p  pI want to copy data from one file and paste it to another file master file. However, it cant overwrite the existing data, so it should select the first empty cell in a specific column. Please Help Me If possible could you add as much as possible comments so that I can understand and learn to do it for myself in the future. p  pThe data files are call logs and these numbers that are copied are results of an analysis that I execute in vba. So there will be a new data file every day, but the actual data that I copy is always located in the same cells. On the other hand the Master file is always the same, but the range where I paste the data changes.p  pExample Data file strong25strong S1 in excel data file strong44strong S2 in exel data file strong8.6.2013strong S13 in excel data file These are all created with a vba code that involves formulas, so they will always be in the same cell. There are some other data cells as well, but I hope to learn from this so that I can include them myself.p  pMaster file on the other hand is the same always. The only thing that varies in the Master file is the cell where I paste the data. The cell is practically always the row bellow the previous insert.p  pMaster file Cell S1 from data file should be copied to Master File N3, then the next time to N4 and then to N5 and so on... so it should find the first free cell in column N. p  pCell S2 from data file should be copied to Master file H3 and from there downward in the same manner as previous.p  pCell S13 from data file should be copied to Master file A3 and downwards in the same manner as previous.p  pEditp  pThis is what works in the master file to retrieve the entire column B, but it overwrites the whole column. Hence it works well to import work hours from one file, that is always the same. Then again for the analysis data file the problem is that the code above works from the master file and in this case when the data file actually changes every day I have no idea how to change this so that it would retrieve the right file. p  precodeSub Workhours   copypaste1 Macro  Dim wsMaster As Worksheet, wbDATA As Workbook Dim NextRow As Long, LastRow As Long  Set wsMaster  ThisWorkbook.SheetsSheet1  NextRow  wsMaster.RangeA amp Rows.Count.EndxlUp.Row  1  Set wbDATA  Workbooks.OpenCusersheppanettiGoogle Driveheppanettioutboundworkinghours.xlsx   With wbDATA.SheetsSheet1  ColumnsBB.Select  Selection.Copy  WindowsColdCallingStatstemplate.xlsx.Activate  ColumnsBB.Select  ActiveSheet.Paste   wbDATA.Close False  End With  End Sub codepre

Negative 186 pSo I have two tables codetableuserscode and codetablevaluescode p  pcodetableuserscode have columns consisting of codeidcodeprimary auto increment, codeusernamecode, codelogitudecode, codelatitudecodep  pcodetablevaluescode consist of columns codeuseridcode and codeotherUseridcode. Neither are primary keys or unique or auto increment.p  pThe purpose of codetablevaluecode is to store all the users id who have the same codelogitudecode and codelatitudecode as the logged in user. However I do not want to add the main user itself, only the ones who match hisher location values. Also I dont want to add the other users if they have already been added regardless of their location values. p  pSo below lets use bob as an example. I want to query the tableusers and insert all the users id that match bobs longitude and latitude into tablevalues but not bob himself.p  precodeTableusers  id    username longitude latitude 1      bob      1          2 2      sam      1          2 3      fred     3          4 4      alex     1          2  Tablevalues userid     otherUserId 1              2 1              4 2              1 2              4 4              1 4              2 codepre  pSo at the moment I am able to add users who have the same location without adding the main user but I cannot add multiple rows into codetablevaluescode.

Negative 186 pI am working on a hover dropdown panel, containing the Google, Facebook, Youtube, and Twitter social widgets listed for visitors to oneclick each of them without the panel closing.p  pI started with simple jquery dropdown menu, simplified it down to a single ul li div, so on mouseover of a single menu item Socialize, it displays a div containing all 4 social widgets. So far so good. as long as you hover over the single menu item or the div that contains the 4 social widgets, it remains visible, and moving outside the div causes it to hide. p  pThe issue I am having, is that the Google widget has a Follow button, which on mouseover, opens its own small drop menu to select which circle you wish to choose. when this Google drop menu appears, the parent div loses focus for lack of a better term, and the containing div hides.

Negative 186 pI have this practice project that allows the user to draw on the screen as they touch with their fingers. Very simple App I did as exercise way back. My little cousin took the liberty of drawing things with his finger with my iPad on this App Kids drawings circle, lines, etc, whatever came to his mind. Then he started to draw circles and then he asked me to make it good circle from my understanding make the drawn circle perfectly round, as we know  no matter how stable we try to draw something with our finger on the screen, a circle is never really as rounded like a circle should be. p  pSo my question here is that, is there any way in code where we can first detect a line drawn by the user that forms a circle and generate approximately the same size of the circle by making it perfectly round on the screen. Making a not so straight line straight is something I would know how to do, but as for circle, I dont quite know how to go about doing it with Quartz or other methods. p  pMy reasoning is that, the start and the end point of the line must touch or cross each other after the user lifts his finger to justify the fact that he was trying to actually draw a circle.p

Negative 186 pFirst, context p  pAs a side project, Im building a computer algebra system in Python that yields the steps it takes to solve an equation. p  pSo far, Ive been able to parse algebraic expressions and equations into an expression tree. Its structured something like this not the actual codemay not be runningp  precode Other operators and math functions are based off this.  Numbers and symbols also have their own classes with parent attributes. class Operatorobject     def initself, args         self.children  args                     for child in self.children             child.parent  self   the parser does something like this expr  Add1, Mult3, 4, 5 codepre  pOn top of this, I have a series of functions that operate recursively to simplify expressions.  Theyre not purely functional, but Im trying to avoid relying on mutability for operations, instead returning a modified copy of the node Im working with. Each function looks something like thisp  precodedef simplifynode     for index, child in enumeratenode.children         if isinstancechild, Operator             node.children[index]  simplifynode         else              perform some operations to simplify numbers and symbols             pass      return node codepre  pThe challenge comes in the step by step part. Id like for my simplification functions to all be nested generators that yield the steps it takes to solve something. So basically, every time each function performs an operation, Id like to be able to do something like this codeyield deepcopynode, expression, Combined like terms.code so that whatever is relying on this library can output something likep  precode5x  34x  3 5x  12x  3                 Simplified product 34x into 12x 17x  3                      Combined like terms 5x  12x  17x codepre  pHowever, each function only has knowledge about the codenodecode its operating on, but has no idea what the overall codeexpressioncode looks like.p  pstrongSo this is my question What would be the best way of maintaining the state of the entire expression tree so that each step has knowledge of the entire expressionstrongp  pHere are the solutions Ive come up withp  ul liDo emeveryem operation in place and either use a global variable or an instance variable in a class to store a pointer to the equation. I dont like this because unit testing is tougher, since now I have to set up the class first. You also lose other advantages of a more functional approach.li liPass through the root of the expression to every function. However, this either means I have to repeat every operation to also update the expression or that I have to rely on mutability.li liHave the top level function reconstruct the expression tree based on each step I yield. For example, if I yield code5x  4x  9xcode, have the top level function find the 5x  4x node and replace it with 9x. This seems like the best solution, but how best to reconstruct each stepli ul  pTwo final, related questions Does any of this make sense I have a lot of caffeine in my system right now and have no idea if Im being clear.p  pAm I worrying too much about mutability Is this a case of premature optimizationp

Negative 186 pReading over a hrefhttptomasp.netblogcsharpasyncgotchas.aspxthisa blog post on some of the gotchas of C5s asyncawait. It mentions in Gotcha 4 something that is quite profound and that I hadnt thought of before.p  pBriefly, it covers the scenario where you have a method that has two overloads, one that takes an codeActioncode and one that takes a codeFuncltTaskgtcode for example codeTask.Runcode. This issue is rooted in the argument that codeasync voidcode methods should only be used for event handlers, with the post then going on to portray the following scenario  What does the compiler infer when a lambda function like the following can be compiled to both a codeFuncltTaskgtcode and an codeActioncodep  precodeTask.Runasync  gt    await Task.Delay1000  codepre  pBecause codeTask.Runcode has signatures of both codeTask.RunFuncltTaskgtcode and codeTask.RunActioncode, what type is the async anonymous function compiled to An codeasync voidcode or a codeFuncltTaskgtcode My gut feeling says it will compile down to an codeasync voidcode purely because its a nongeneric type however the C Compiler might be smart and give codeFuncltTaskgtcode types preference.p  pAlso, is there a way to explicitly declare which overload I wish to use I know I could just create a new instance of codeFuncltTaskgtcode and pass in the async lambda function there but it would still compile down to a codeasync voidcode and then pass that into the constructor of the codeFuncltTaskgtcode. What is the ideal way to make sure its compiled as a codeFuncltTaskgtcodep

Negative 186 pIm teaching myself C and learning about class to class conversions.  I understand that when trying to do a class to class conversion, you must use the codeoperatorcode keyword.  In this particular case, I have 2 classes  codeLtimecode and codeTimecode.  I am trying to create a method using codeoperatorcode to be able to convert each class to each other. p  pMy problem is that because I am trying to use the codeoperatorcode keyword to convert from a class, the first class declaration will be referring to a class that is not yet defined. If I was to switch the first class and second class, the same problem would persist since they both depend on each other.  p  pMy textbook says to solve this problem, you use a forward declaration for the second class.  I did this but this does not solve my problem.  I then tried to split up the classes into separate files for each and use include statements in each and in the main file but that did not work.  If this is the solution, could someone please explain the structure of this solutionp  pCan someone please explain how I could get this code to work  For clarity, below is the problem and my code.

Negative 186 pI need to watch a BOOL and if it is YES I need to call a method. How do I do thatp
Negative 186 pI like to use a BaseDomain class for all my JPA domain entities.  In the base class, I have an object ID, stored as a String, generated from UUID.random.  The object ID is assigned at object creation.  The entity class also has a primary key, assigned by the database when persisted.p  pUp until this point, Ive always persisted the String based object ID.  This adds an additional column to each table, but that doesnt bother me.p  pI was wondering  Is there any reason to persist the object id the generated UUID  Or should the random UUID stay in the Java spacep  pI always base my domain class hashCode and equals methods on the UUID, not the primary key.  This is fine because the UUID stays the same for a given entity for its entire life, both in the JVM and in the database.p  pIf I stopped persisting the UUID, what would the hashCode and equals methods look like  Would it be like a two tier comparison, first using the primary key if its not null, then using the object id, if the primary key is nullp

Negative 186 pI have a session wrapper class in my ASP.NET MVC application that is used to store frequently used data like current user info, supplier info etc in Session. Session runs InProc. Everything works perfectly, but I know it is a bad design to have session in InProc mode as it is not scalable and it is tightly coupled to application pool. I didnt want to use Sql Server for managing sessions as it seems to be a last resort as speed is number 1 priority for us. So after doing a bit of research, it looked like Redis DB is the fastest option here compared to MongoDB, RavenDB etc. I used this provider a hrefhttpsgithub.comTheCloudlessSkyHarbour.RedisSessionStateStore relnofollowhttpsgithub.comTheCloudlessSkyHarbour.RedisSessionStateStorea. After implementing it as per instructions, it worked. But now I am getting occasional slow down of the site, where pages sometimes probably 30 of the time load very very slow. As soon as I switch it back to InProc mode it all runs fine. I wonder if I installed Redis incorrectly or there are some tricks that I have to do to make it run smoothly. Can anyone help If you require bits of code, I can provide it, but it is pretty much the same as per a hrefhttpsgithub.comTheCloudlessSkyHarbour.RedisSessionStateStore relnofollowhttpsgithub.comTheCloudlessSkyHarbour.RedisSessionStateStorea sample.

Negative 186 pIm fairly new in Android development so please forgive me if its a stupid question. Basically I have an iPhone app,which will compress UIImage into NSData, using UIImageJPEGRepresentation method, this is not a problem. The question begins when I am trying to read this data on an Android device. Im transferring the image data NSDatafrom iPhone to Android, and I want to display the image on Android. How should I do so Is there any customised class that can do function similar to UIImage imageWithData in Java, that can decode the data and turn it into Bitmap Or should I try to encode and decode using a different but stand method If so, what are the options Thank you so much for your helpp

Negative 186 pRecently I have received a project to make a webpage comply with WCAG 2.0 Level A. The part that I am running into a problem at the moment is the datepicker component. The datepicker component allows the user to select the date in two ways. One way is to manually type in a date, for example, 04062014. The other way is to select the small image beside it and a calendar would basically popup and the user can select the date from there.p  pWhile researching over the web, some people have suggested that we do not have to make the image part of the datepicker component accessible since the textfield itself provides an alternative for accessibility. Is this acceptable strongFirst Questionstrong p  pIf this is the right way to go, how do I make it so that accessibility technology like screen reader would ignore the image icon strongSecond Questionstrong I have also tried to research for this issue.

Negative 186 pIm currently developing an application targeted at android and desktop devices using apache cordova and HTML5. p  pIn order to get the numeric keyboard to pop up Ive used codeinput typenumbercode, which works fine. p  pHowever, the input field should also accept codestringscode. The current functionality of codetypenumbercode is that the ui seems to allow for strings to be entered, but the value property of the element is not changed if the input is invalid e.g not numberic. p  pstrongIs there a way of getting the numberic keyboard on mobile devices, while still being able to enter textstrongp  pMy inital tries consisted of capturing the keydown event and manually setting the codethis.valuecode property. Ive tried this using jQuerys code.valcode and of course the more native approach codeelement.val  charcode. None of which work. UI is updated, but the change is not reflected in the model. p  pstrongEDITstrongp  pFor the next guy trying to achieve this. p  pem1em The HTML solution.p  pAs LuudJacobs mentions in the comments below emTheres currently no way to decide which keyboard is shown except for defining the typeattribute.em Though some devices have a button to go back to alphabet keyboard, its not the case for every device. And can not be used reliably. p  pem2em Writing a phonegapcordova plugin. p  pIt is possible to write a plugin to show and hide the keyboard at will. But, as far as I could find, there is currently no way of programmatically telling it to default to the symbols keyboard. Thus the functionality achieved is similar to using codetypenumbercode and codetypetextcode in the HTML. Another problem with this approach is the diversity of keyboard for android devices, where even users themselves can install their custom keyboard. The functionality of the keyboard can are therefore unknown. What works on one device, may not work on the next. p  pem3em JSHTMLCanvas solutionp  pFinally... A feasible solution. I suggest taking a look at a hrefhttpcode.tutsplus.comtutorialscreatingakeyboardwithcssandjquerynet5774 relnofollowthis walkthrougha as it shows an easy way to creating the keyboard using just html and js. Another option would be to use a canvas, and draw the keyboard yourself, but I would imagine that this is more error prone and harder to do.p

Negative 186 pI have a large set of data that consists of coordinates x,y and a numeric z value that is similar to density.

Negative 186 pI have an array filled with arrays. Each array within the master array contains data scraped from a realty website. When I output them to a CSV file I want to make each category of data price, address, size, etc... its own separate column. Right now, each category is stored within a row. I have looked a few threads here about this and cannot get the code to work. I think its because this array does not contain strings, it contains arrays that each contain strings. I would like to know how to accomplish this. I tried doing arrayflip however it returned an error that said the array must contain strings or numbers.p  pHere is what I have right nowp  precodeltphp              URL HERE               html  filegetcontentsURLHERE                DOM  new DOMDocument             libxmluseinternalerrorstrue             DOMgtloadHTMLhtml                price              pfinder  new DomXPathDOM             classnamep  pricelarge             pnodes  pfindergtquery[containsclass, classnamep]             csvvaluesp  array             foreach pnodes as pnode                  csvvaluesp[]  pnodegtnodeValue                                          zestimate              zfinder  new DomXPathDOM             classnamez  zestimate             znodes  zfindergtquery[containsclass, classnamez]             csvvaluesz  array             foreach znodes as znode                  csvvaluesz[]  znodegtnodeValue                            address              afinder  new DomXPathDOM             classnamea  propertyaddress             anodes  afindergtquery[containsclass, classnamea]                             csvvaluesa  array             foreach anodes as anode                  csvvaluesa[]  anodegtnodeValue                                                 property details              dfinder  new DomXPathDOM             classnamed  propertydata             dnodes  dfindergtquery[containsclass, classnamed]             csvvaluesd  array             foreach dnodes as dnode                  csvvaluesd[]  dnodegtnodeValue                                  lot size              lfinder  new DomXPathDOM             classnamel  propertylot             lnodes  lfindergtquery[containsclass, classnamel]             csvvaluesl  array             foreach lnodes as lnode                  csvvaluesl[]  lnodegtnodeValue                                  year built              yfinder  new DomXPathDOM             classnamey  propertyyear             ynodes  yfindergtquery[containsclass, classnamey]             csvvaluesy  array             foreach ynodes as ynode                  csvvaluesy[]  ynodegtnodeValue                                                                Master Array              outputarray  arraycsvvaluesp,csvvaluesz,csvvaluesa,csvvaluesd,csvvaluesl,csvvaluesy              vardumpoutputarray               Export to .CSV              fp  fopenpropertydata3.csv, w or diephperrormsg             foreach outputarray as output                  fputcsvfp, output                          fclosefp              gt codepre

I do not want to keep the width of the text.  To get around this issue I have my pre text to be in a div that has word wrap break word.  This converts the text to only appear within the width of the mobile app  i.e. I dont have to scroll to the right.  Getting rid of word wrap break word makes the pre text go out to its original width.  I want to disable word wrap but keep my pretext within the codewidthcode of the app how do I do thatp
Negative 186 pIm trying to build a registry editor in C WinForms and am struggling to match the searching performance of Windows builtin regedit.exe. My only gripe with that program for many years has been that you cant type in a full key path and be taken straight to that key, so I decided to implement this functionality along with a few other minor improvements into my own program.p  pThe first hurdle that I had to overcome was developing a method to read the 10K or so keys in a typical Windows registry and display them to the user. From what Ive read on here and other websites and tried, it seems the fastest way to do this is to lazyload the keys into a TreeView. So my program starts by loading just five hive key TreeNodes into a TreeView along with a dummy child for each one so they can be expanded. Then as the user expands nodes their children are loaded as well.p  pThis works relatively well, but the second challenge is now to be able to find all keys whose names partially match a given string. This is synonymous to regedit.exes F3 search with only Keys checked and Match whole string only unchecked. I believe this performs a linear depthfirst search of the currently selected registry key and those below it, then loops around to those before it. So I originally thought that in my program, it is inevitable that any search will require a lot of extra loading on the fly, completely obliterating the performance benefits gained from lazyloading.p  pI then realised that on every search iteration, I could collate just the nodes that matched and add them all to the TreeView at the end. This improves things greatly but its still taking roughly 2 mins for my averagebymodernstandards computer to search the entire registry for a string that doesnt exist anywhere, and roughly 2  5 seconds for each occurrence of software to be found. regedit.exe seems to be faster by a factor of 0.5 or so.p  pSo can anyone give me any tips on how I could make this faster Heres the a hrefhttpsdl.dropboxusercontent.comu64884336RegEditor.zip relnofollowfull projecta for anyone that wants to take a closer look.

If anyone has some insight I would really appreciate it            h2Appetizersh2p  precode  ltpgt      ltstronggtMozzarella Sticksltstronggtltbr gt      Golden fried and served with marinara sauce.  7.49ltbr gt   ltpgt    ltpgt      ltstronggtSpicy Buffalo Wingsltstronggtltbr gt      An American classic with a kick Grilled to perfection      and tossed in the hottest sauce we got  8.99ltbr gt      ltstronggtSpicyltstronggt   ltpgt    ltpgt      ltstronggtCrab Wontonsltstronggtltbr gt      Crab, cream cheese, scallions, bell peppers.  6.99   ltpgt    ltpgt      ltstronggtVegetable Spring Rollsltstronggtltbr gt      Cabbage, ginger, carrots, celery, scallions, onions,      black mushrooms, glass noodles, rolled in a crispy      wrapper.  6.99ltbr gt      ltstronggtVegetarianltstronggt   ltpgt    ltpgt      ltstronggtNachosltstronggtltbr gt      Creamy white queso blended with fresh tomatoes,      red onion, cilantro and roasted poblanos.

Negative 186 pFor some reason, upon clicking submit, my page simply redirects back to an emptied form. I cannot seem to figure out the reason. My only guess is that its not recognizing the submit is true and simply returning to itself via the else clause. However, Ive switched the action for the form to a defined URL eg a hrefhttpgoogle.com relnofollowhttpgoogle.coma and had it send me to the target. Any assistance is greatly appreciated.p  pEdit I have been able to reliably show that is is the action value of my form tag which is not behaving properly.p  pI performed the following test I can enter in to either of the conditions for my ifelse statement and have that value echo below the conditionals. However, if I try to echo that above the form it returns nothing, but the values Ive entered in to the form WILL echo above the form eg. conferenceName as POST[conferenceName] will echo above the form.p  precodeltDOCTYPE htmlgt lthtmlgt     ltheadgt         lttitlegtConference Registration [This Page Not Yet Active]lttitlegt         ltlink relstylesheet typetextcss hrefcmxform.cssgt     ltheadgt     ltbodygt         ltform methodpost actionltphp echo action gt classcmxformgt         ltfieldsetgt             ltlegendgtExample Conference Registrationltlegendgt             ltol styleliststyletype nonegt                 ltligt                     ltlabel forconferenceNamegtApplicants Nameltemgtltemgtltlabelgt ltinput nameconferenceName typetextgt                 ltligt                 ltligt                     ltlabel forconferenceAgencySchoolgtAgency Schoolltemgtltemgtltlabelgt ltinput nameconferenceAgencySchool typetextgt                 ltligt                 ltligt                     ltlabel forconferenceAgencyAddressgtAgency Addressltemgtltemgtltlabelgt ltinput nameconferencePhysicalAddress typetextgt                 ltligt                 ltligt                     ltlabel forconferenceCitygtCityltemgtltemgtltlabelgt ltinput nameconferenceCity typetextgt                 ltligt                 ltligt                     ltlabel forconferenceStategtStateltemgtltemgtltlabelgt ltinput nameconferenceState typetextgt                 ltligt                 ltligt                     ltlabel forconferenceZipgtZipltemgtltemgtltlabelgt ltinput nameconferenceZip typetextgt                 ltligt                 ltligt                     ltlabel forconferencePhonegtPhoneltemgtltemgtltlabelgt ltinput nameconferencePhone typetextgt                 ltligt                 ltligt                     ltlabel forconferenceExtensiongtExtensionltlabelgt ltinput nameconferenceExtension typetextgt                 ltligt                 ltligt                     ltlabel forconferenceNumberOfAttendeesgtNumber of Attendeesltemgtltemgtltlabelgt ltinput nameconferenceNumberOfAttendees typetextgt                 ltligt                 ltligt                     ltlabel forconferencePointOfContactNamegtP.o.C.

Negative 186 pIm new to psychopy and python.  Im trying to program a way to quit a script that I didnt write, by pressing a key for example.  Ive added this to the while loopp  precodewhile n lt total   starttime.clock   if lenevent.getKeys gt 0     break    Another while loop here that ends when time is past a certain duration after start. codepre  pAnd its not working, it doesnt register any key presses.  So Im guessing key presses are only registered during specific times.  What are those times  What is required to register key presses  That loop is extremely fast, sending signals every few milliseconds, so I cant just add wait commands in the loop.p  pIf I could just have a parallel thread checking for a key press that would be good too, but that sounds complicated to learn.p  pThanksp  pEdits The code runs as expected otherwise in particular no errors.  core and event are included.  There arent any other event command of any kind that would affect the key press log.p  pChanging the rest of the loop content to something that includes core.wait statements makes it work.  So for anybody else having this difficulty, my original guess was correct key presses are not registered during busy times i.e. in my case a while statement that constantly checks the time, or possibly only during specific busy times...  Perhaps someone with more knowledge can clarify.p

Negative 186 pGood morning, Im testing the free version of Xamarin Studio and I want to connect my Android application to my database. As I write in the title Im using SQL Server 2008 R2 and I read that the best solution is to use a web service.

Someone can guide me I found this link a hrefhttpwww.asp.netwebapioverviewgettingstartedwithaspnetwebapitutorialyourfirstwebapi relnofollowhttpwww.asp.netwebapioverviewgettingstartedwithaspnetwebapitutorialyourfirstwebapia.

Negative 186 pI created a custom codePreferencecode for my Android App, a numberpicker preference to be exact. Its really a shame that Android dont provide already a builtin preference for that, but we need to deal with it so I created one and since I could reuse that code in future projects I decided to make it using codelongcode values, so it could handle very large numbers, but I found something very curious.p  pYou can store codelongcode values on the codeSharedPreferencescode but there isnt any codegetLongcode on a codeTypedArraycode which is used to access attribute values on Android.

Will the client get all of the messages that were sent to him while he was disconnectedp  pFor example lets consider LongPolling transport. As far as Im aware long polling is a simple http request that is issued in advance by the client in order to wait a server event.p  pAs soon as server event occurs the data getting published on the http request which leads to closing connection on issued http request. After that, client issues new http request that repeats the whole loop again.p  h1The problemh1  pSuppose two events happened on the server, first codeAcode then codeBcode nearly instantly.

Negative 186 pHi I have a delphi application that consists of multiple forms, I would like it so that when a user clicks to openshow a new form, the new form opens with the Form.Left and Form.Top which are copied from the previous form to the new form. I tried using a SenderTObject for this but I only have basic graphical delphi and object oriented knowledge. This is how I would have to do it each time manually for an example of opening the database form from the main menu form using an OnClick eventp  precodeMainMenuForm.Hide DatabaseForm.LeftMainMenuForm.Left DatabaseForm.TopMainMenuForm.Top DatabaseForm.Show  codepre  pHowever I have multiple forms with multiple OnClick events to each form so I would have to do this with different forms each time. I know that may have sounded confusing but hopefully someone knows what Im talking about and I know theres probably a simple solution to this problem, Thanks.p

Negative 186 pI have been struggling with passing objects between form modules for several days now and I am completely baffled as how to achieve this, what I would think would be, simple task. So I have made a simple database to explain the problem I am having.

I have tried a number of variations of Public, Static declarations all over the place on both the object variable and the subs but I cannot seem to figure out how to preserve the object across modules.p  pAnybody help  Thanks. p

Negative 186 pI am running into a problem in our iOS app. I have set up interstitials in both DoubleClick for Publishers Small Business. The implementation in our app was straightforward and interstitials get displayed when my triggers are being hit. p  pNow I want to limit the interstitials with a frequency cap of once per day. I have set this up in the corresponding line item, but this does not seem to be respected inside the app. p  pExample I have set up a frequency cap of once per day. I open the app, get to the point where the interstitial ad shows, I click away the interstitial and close the app. When I open the app again and navigate to the interstitial target point, I get another interstitial  although as far as I understand this the frequency cap should be working in this case.p  pAs a sidenote, in the Android app with a different line item, but otherwise similar setup, everything works fine.p  pDo I have to set something special inside the iOS Ad request code Or is there a special DfP setting for iOS apps to allow frequency cappingp

The a hrefhttpsgithub.comgitlabhqgitlabhqblob667c0a909bde1cf71f21d8ec9768e98b1c489030dochookscustomhooks.md relnofollowintroduction of custom hooksa has made this a lot easier as I no longer have to monkey with the Gitlab code to recover the hook positions it was previously hijacking.p  pThe codepostreceivecode hook in this location works great for all commits coming in via SSH. The problem I have is that these hooks do not seem to be called when the web interface built in editor is used to make a commit. Ive tried putting a codepostcommitcode hook in the customhooks folder of my repo but it does not seem to get called. It seems like this lack of hook calling is also the case if I use the HTTPS address for connecting to git rather than SSH.p  pIs there a way to configure Gitlab or a place to put my hooks such that it will be called for all commits that hit the repository, not just remote pushes via SSHp

I tried converting to binary, using a bagofwords, and an associativearray with each letter corresponding to a primenumber.p  pI looked into Googles word2vec just to convert the words into wordvectors, but Im looking for something I can implement in the browser. This is why I am looking for an algorithm that I can write in js.p  pI know theres node.js implementations of word2vec, but they just run word2vec in the commandline.p  pThis is different than this question, a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comq298800713743069herea, that I asked earlier because I am looking for something that retains semantic meaning. I thought about using word similarity techniques, but didnt know how to implement resnik similarity in js.p  pI greatly appreciate any help or direction in converting nl sentences, or just the topic of them, to wordvectors or an array of ints.p

Negative 186 pI have website based on Angular.js and html5. Its also based on mongoDB.p  pI need to load all the DB from the server to the client in order to support offline functionality. Whenever a user enters, the website must check that all the data from the DB has been downloaded and if its not, it downloads everything to the cache in background.p  pMy goal is to ensure that if the user goes offline, he would still be able to work with all the the modules I supply. Caching pages with manifest file is not enough.p  pFor example  If I manage a flights ordering website, so when the user goes to orders page, I must download in background all the info for flights, and if the connection breaks down, he would still see the flights page completely because it was downloaded before. The DB is being changed all the time so there must be a function that updates the cache when needed.p  pWhats the best way of doing thisp  pThanksp

Negative 186 pI ran into this issue late last night and I just figured out what happened, but I want to understand why. I tested my code in my local using sqlite and it worked fine, but when I deployed to heroku postgres, a summary table was not showing the right results.

I used gccfortran4.1.1.tar.bz2 basically I want to downgrade gfortran in Cygwin. the files in the tarball were lacking so I had to debug some things and add some files with some wgets like the most current versions of config.guess and config.sub to get it to configure I also used autoconf, autoreconf, and automake. Long story short, I tried to run make and I got a long list of errors. p  pI have access to a Linux machine with gfortran 4.1.1 already on it on which it works perfectly, and tried to make it there, but it gave a lot of errors as well, completely different from those from Cygwin. At the end are the errors, the first being those from Cygwin and the latter from Linux.

It was an executable, so it was nice to not have to build it. It downloaded and it works. However, there are a lot of errors. It didnt recognize all the comments beginning with c, so I changed them all to s. Then the compiler mentioned continuations. There are hundreds of continuations in the code, and only a limited amount are allowed per version and format type I think. Essentially the compiler processes Fortran 95 files naturallyits in the name, but the file is not a Fortran file. I tried to pass a stdlegacy or something similar, but apparently the only options are for Fortran 95, 2003, and 2008. Itd take forever to change a 7000line and a 3000line Fortran 7790 file to Fortran 95 files, so I stopped.

Negative 186 pIm currently creating an app that has the following architecturep  ul liViewController  this displays a list of RSS items articles at summary levelli liDetailedViewController  this displayed the RSS item article selected in more detailli liFeedModel  this parses the RSS feed and creates the article objectsli liArticle  this is the specifics of the article objectli ul  pThe articles are news items for sporting players, and what Im currently trying to do is allow the user to click a button on the DetailedViewController to save that sporting player, so that I can implement a MyPlayersViewController which will show articles only pertaining to the players they have saved. My issue is that when I save the players unique ID to a MyPlayersArray in the DetailedViewController I lose the ability to keep that information stored, so when the user goes back to the ViewController and then into another article about the same player the app has forgotten which players have been saved.p  pAny tips on how I should be trying to implement this or what I should read would be greatly appreciated.p

Negative 186 pi am a student and right now Im doing an internship working with a local library, and in this case i have the following problemp  pIn the project im making, i need to retrieve image data from a temporal table, constructed in ORACLE that receives its data from some triggers in an INFORMIX DB and parse it through a monitor made in JAVA, in a JSON format to a web service published in C and insert that image in a SQL Server DB. br p  pI looked around and i found that it was possible to parse images through JSON using Base64 encoding and whatnot but when they talk about it they say that you must have the image path file and encode it. as you may have realized by now, i cant use that route because i dont have those images, best case scenario, the triggers are able to feed some BLOB data by what Ive been told. but i have to insert them in the SQL Server DB as VarbinaryMAX.p  pTo summarizebr Informix DB has images  br       triggers feed an ORACLE Temptable images sent probably as BLOB or CLOB at mostbrmonitor made in JAVA must read those BLOBS or CLOBS and send them through JSONbr Web Service made in C must receive that JSON, and insert the images in a SQL Server DB where they need to be visible, without having the physical file to refer to.p  pthe schema im using it has been IMPOSED to me, i didnt had a saying in this is something similar to this its really long and tedious code so ill try to make it as neat and clean as possiblep  pThis is the part of the java monitor that specifies which fields from the temptable are feeding what fields in the JSON

I want to write a test for Play 2.4 application and the thing its codeplay.test.WithBrowsercode class relies on JUnit callbacks. I  found this workaround for the issuep  precode var testBrowser  TestBrowser     before     new WithBrowser       override def createBrowser Unit          super.createBrowser        testBrowser  browser        .createBrowser codepre  pp  pbut I believe its quite ugly and I suspect that there is a better way.  p  pSo, my question is if its possible to make these JUnit lifecycle callbacks work with ScalaTest And if it is possible, how to do that p
Negative 186 pIf I have a list codelist1[1,15,9,3,6,21,10,11]code how do I obtain the smallest 2 integers from thatp  pcodemincode gives me one number, but what about 2p
