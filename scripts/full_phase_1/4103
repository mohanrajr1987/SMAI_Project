Positive 4103 pIm binding to a codeListltMyCustomTypegtcode and when I put a breakpoint on property getters in codeMyCustomTypecode, they are seemingly being called repeatedly. What causes the codeDataGridViewcode to automatically reread the data and can I control thisp  pSecondly, I note that when I make changes to the data in the grid, these are not immediately replicated to the DataSource. Putting breakpoints on property setters in codeMyCustomTypecode, they only seem to be called when I click outside the grid control. How can I make sure changes made in the GUI are immediately applied to the data sourcep

Positive 4103 pI want to use codeDataGridViewcode basically as a fancy list control, where some columns use checkboxes and others allow selecting a value from a dropdown list of possible values.p  pI want to populate the view from registry key values e.g. the user selects the registry key, and values from that key are used to add rows to the view following some bespoke logic. As the user changes values in the Cells, these should cause the registry to be updated.p  pI believe an unbound approach no dataset is the best option here, manually adding rows and adding onchange event handlers to each cell. But I wanted to check this makes sense, and Im not trying to force my C view of things on to the more sophisticated .NET databinding approach  am I doing this in a reasonable mannerp

Positive 4103 pI have a datagrid binded to a dataset. So everytime I want to insert data I just click on the binding navigator to create then I write on the columns.

The deal here is when Im in the middle of the datagrid columns half inserted I cant focus and use other controls without that incomplete datagrid trying to issue the data validating. Everytime I do this it clears all my data I wrote when an exception is thrown because of table relations ships of not nulls and primary keys so it goes lost and its kinda boring for the end user.p  pI thought I could cancel a validating event process when Im just leaving the control and I keep the data half inserted on the columns of a new row.

Positive 4103 pI know this question is a lot like a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions3340192datagridviewboundtobindinglistdoesnotrefreshwhenvaluechangedthis other onea, but still I cant figure out the answer.p  pThing is, my class emdoesem implement INotifyPropertyChanged, and my grid emdoesem update... just not right away.  The values kindof update in bursts instead of real time as each one changes.  The bursts are about 3 seconds apart, at which time a whole bunch of values update at the same time.  Id like the grid cells to reflect the value updates immediately, and not in batches.  Its as if the grid is trying to improve performance by withholding a lot of individual changes in favour of waiting for a bunch of changes to accumulate before reflecting them in the UI.p  pMy specific binding scenariop  ul liWinformsli liDataGridViewli ligrid DataSource is a BindingSourceli liBindingSources source is SortableBindingList of MyClassli liSortableBindingList inherits BindingList of Tli liMyClass implements INotifyPropertyChangedli liBackgroundWorker threads make changes to individual properties of list items, with 5 threads running at one timeli ul  pUpdatep  pThe answer is essentially this a hrefhttpsmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibraryms171728.aspx relnofollowhttpsmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibraryms171728.aspxap  pHowever, as this is a pet project with me as its end user, I dont feel like going to this length right now, so Ive just caught the exceptions, and will put up with the slightly inconsistent grid update behaviour.

However, then that sources column name does not get updated, so they are out of sync. Just having the table as the Data Source does not automatically update column names like it does the actual data.p  pI figured Id use the ColumnHeaderCellChanged event to change these properties back to what they are supposed to be, because Id expect that the code above would fire that....but it doesnt.p  pSo I guess my questions are  Why does changing the column name of the data source have this effect changing properties of the DGVs column, Why is the ColumnHeaderCellChanged event not firing, And is there some other way I can manage to change both the DGV columns header and the data sources column name, plus have that columns other properties remain as they were or be put backp  pThank youp

Negative 4103 pWhile searching SO for approaches to error handling related to business rule validation, all I encounter are examples of structured exception handling.p  pMSDN and many other reputable development resources are very clear that exceptions are emnot to be used to handle routine error cases.em  They are only to be used for exceptional circumstances and unexpected errors that may occur from improper use by the programmer but not the user.  In many cases, user errors such as fields that are left blank are common, and things which our program emshouldem expect, and therefore are not exceptional and not candidates for use of exceptions.p  pQUOTEp  blockquote   pRemember that the use of the term   exception in programming has to do   with the thinking that an exception   should represent an exceptional   condition. Exceptional conditions, by   their very nature, do not normally   occur so strongyour code should not throw   exceptions as part of its everyday   operations.strongp      pstrongDo not throw exceptions to signal   commonly occurring events.strong Consider   using alternate methods to communicate   to a caller the occurrence of those   events and strongleave the exception   throwing for when something truly out   of the ordinary happens.strongp blockquote  pFor example, proper usep  precodeprivate void DoSomethingstring requiredParameter  if requiredParameter  null throw new ArgumentExpcetionrequiredParameter cannot be null  Remainder of method body...  codepre  pImproper usep  precode Renames item to a name supplied by the user.  Name must begin with an F. public void RenameItemstring newName      Items must have names that begin with F    if newName.StartsWithF throw new RenameExceptionNew name must begin with F     Remainder of method body...  codepre  pIn the above case, according to best practices, it would have been better to pass the error up to the UI without involvingrequiring .NETs exception handling mechanisms.p  pUsing the same example above, suppose one were to need to enforce a set of naming rules against items.  What approach would be bestp  ol lipHaving the method return a enumerated result  RenameResult.Success, RenameResult.TooShort, RenameResult.TooLong, RenameResult.InvalidCharacters, etc.pli lipUsing an event in a controller class to report to the UI class  The UI calls the controllers RenameItem method, and then handles an AfterRename event that the controller raises and  that has rename status as part of the event argspli lipThe controlling class directly references and calls a method from the UI class that handles the error, e.g. ReportErrorstring text.pli lipSomething else... pli ol  pEssentially, I want to know how to perform complex validation in classes that may not be the Form class itself, and pass the errors back to the Form class for display  but I do not want to involve exception handling where it should not be used even though it seems much easierp  hr  pBased on responses to the question, I feel that Ill have to state the problem in terms that are more concretep  pUI  User Interface, BLL  Business Logic Layer in this case, just a different classp  ol liUser enters value within UI.li liUI reports value to BLL.li liBLL performs routine validation of the value.li liBLL discovers rule violation.li liBLL returns rule violation to UI.li liUI recieves return from BLL and reports error to user.li ol  pSince it is routine for a user to enter invalid values, exceptions should not be used.

Negative 4103 pI have some basic questions around understanding fundamentals of Performance testing. I know that under various circumstances we might want to do  Stress Testing  Endurance Testing etc. But my main objective here is to ensure that response time is decent from application under a set of load which is towards a higher end or in least above average load.p  pMy questions are as followsp  ol lipWhen you start to plan your expected response time of application what do you consider. If thats the first step at all. I mean, I have a web application now. Do I just pull out a figure from air and say I would expect application to take 3 seconds to respond to each request. and then go about figuring out what my application is lacking to get that response timepli lipOR is it the other way round, and you start performance test with a given set of hardware and say, lets see what response time I get now, and then look at results and say, well its 8 seconds right now, Id like it to be 3 seconds at max, so lets see how we can optimize it to be 3 seconds But again is 3 seconds out of air I am sure, scaling up machines only will not get response time up. Itll get response time up only when single machineserver is under load and you start clustering pli lipNow for one single user I have response time as 3 seconds but as the load increases it goes down exponentially so where do I draw the line between I need to optimize code further which has its upper limit and I need to scale up my servers Which has a limit toopli lipWhat are the best free tools to do performance and load testing I have used Jmeter a bit. But is there anything else, that is good and open source pli lipIf I have to optimize code, I start profiling the specific flows which took lot of time responding to requests pli ol  pBasically Id like to see how one goes about from end to end doing performance testing for their application.

I would like a simple state machine framework that does have basic suspend  resume  abort without serialization, however.p  pIve downloaded the a hrefhttpcode.google.compstatelessStateless framework from Google Codea and am going to start playing with it, but would love to hear what the other .NET programmers out there are using.p  pstrongEDITstrong Stateless seems really simple to implement, but I do wonder if its the right thing for a candy machine.  In automation, I always feel conflicted about how state machines should be used.  Although I use the term state machine, I do so loosely because I use it more like a flow chart.  Instead of using states to represent the current mode a machine is in, I use it to execute functions.  So in this case with Stateless, Id actually be using the transition from one state to the next as the mechanism for calling functions in my candy machines controller.  Thoughtsp

Manual failover worked fine for several days.

Once I got Query events mapped out, most everything started working in the Publisher Channel.p  pI am now working on sending events back to SFDC Subscriber channel when changes occur in eDirectory. p  pI am using the upsert function in the SOAP API, and with Novell Identity Manager, you basically build the SOAP doc, and can see the results as you build it.

Negative 4103 pIm working on a new project that is in .net 3.5.p  pCurrently the client is using stored procs and we would really like to use LINQ to SQL instead. The main reason they use stored procs is because they believe they are easier to update and such, they dont use any special permissions or such that I can see justify the use of stored procs over LINQ to SQL just they dont want to change.p  pI figure if I can present them a solution whereby they can easily deploy changes to the LINQ to SQL they might be more open to changing their mind.p  pAs such Im curious with an asp.net project not mvc how to go about updating the various assemblies that get created during the build process.p  pSay for instance all of my LINQ code is in a System.DataAccess project and that gets deployed to production, a prod bug then gets identified with the LINQ. How difficult is it to just deploy the changed DataAccess project or rather any project that has had significant changes since the prod deployment.p  pOne thing Im not sure that will help the situation is that everytime there is a build the build number gets updated on all of the projects regardless of whether there was actually changes or not so just by looking at the version number of the projects would not be enough to determine the projects that need to be redeployed.p  pIm not even sure if its possible to modify a build so only the changed projects have their version updatedp  pSo basically Im just curious as to the various patching processes out there and pros and cons ie. requires iis reset etc.p  pCheersp

Other major derivatives are ethylene oxideglycol 13, ethylene dichloridevinyl chloride monomer 13 and ethyl benzenestyrene 6, with other uses such as acetaldehyde, alphaolefins, ethylenepropylene elastomers and vinyl acetate representing around 9 of demand. ltPgt         ltBRgt           ltPgtAlthough ethylene gas poses no risk to skin or eyes, the ethylene liquid can cause frostbite. Ethylene is a dangerous fire and explosion hazard. Exposure to ethylene occurs through inhalation, from leaks, spills, accidents, and cigarette smoke. While ethylene gas is invaluable due to its ability to initiate the ripening process in several fruits, it can also be very harmful to many fruits, vegetables, flowers and plants by accelerating the

And judging by my last thirty minutes of searching around, Im assuming that the answer is a resounding no.p  pSo if its a no, heres a follow up question Whats the best workaround Is a COM wrapper around the web service a viable solution for a VBA version that oldp  pMost of the functionality in the web service is simple data storage and retrieval, which I supposed I could do directly with a database connection. But this would result in a lot of duplicate work, and there are some actual procedural calls in the web service that I would still have to support somehow, perhaps in a standalone executable that gets called from the VBA code.p  pDoes anyone have any thoughts on this admittedly peculiar scenariop

Negative 4103 pI do not have any code to show, but using asp.net, vb.net, and SQL with stored procedures.p  pIf on a page I have an item that is added to the database and therefore that information is saved, is there a way to have an exit without saving button on the page that does away with those changesp  pUsing infragisitcs ultrawebgrid, you add an item to one table. You can add an item to another table on that page. i assume adding these items to the table automatically saves in the database. There is also a text box but without clicking save I do not believe that those items are actually added to the database. Update panel is used, I dont know if that matters.p  pIf after someone adds to the table but then decides.. oh wait.. I dont want to do this just yet, is there a oneclick way to act as if I never visited that page to add info Im assuming it would be deleting the entries but this would have to be limited to deleting ONLY those items added while making... we dont want people adding info, then going back and deleting once the save button has been pushed.p

Negative 4103 pIm new to SVN and theres something im stuck on.  For the longest time Ive been developing websites locally MAMP setup and then ftping the whole site live when it is ready.  Any small additional changes I make directly on the live site and every so often I will redownload all of the files on the live server to my localhost since I can never remember all of the files i have changed.  Obviously this is not the best way of doing things.  I was curious how I could setup SVN on a live web server, so every change I make locally it will get pushed onto the website when I tell it to.  Where do i create the svn repo  domain.comwwwsvn   Can i create the www directory as the actual repo, and if so is this bad practicep

Negative 4103 pIm writing a map in HTML that utilizes a background image and an image map to create hover over boxes when mousing over certain points. Below is a section of code for one of the boxes, sans relevant CSS. I discovered an issue with IE when I added the link to my URL this section codelta hrefTEST.COM styletextaligncenter paddingleft 80px titleTESTgtTEST.COM  ltagtcodep  pThe way the hover over map works is by using link classes and the ahover property. However, IE seems to think that it is smarter than every other browser and assumes that my end ending href tag for just the hyperlink also ends the entire box a class, effectively kicking everything below the link out of the box completely and leaves it visible on the side of the page. The intended ending href tag for the entire box is the very last thing on the code block. Naturally, Firefox interprets this perfectly.

Negative 4103 pIm attempting to build a windowbased application system a mini GUI, if you will within an Adobe Air environment Flex 4. When implementing window dragging, I account for the zorder by updating the now activated windows depth from a global function, which updates a hidden variable every time accessed ensuring the selected window is always on top. Note I chose global functions over a set of events because the goal of this action is to receive the returned value immediately, not to tell some other part of the system to do something, so I believe this to be a valid exception to the normal suggestion to use events to communicate between objects. I encountered dozens of possible solutions to create and call this global function, but the only one that has thus far worked isp  pcodeevent.target.parentApplication.obtainNewHigherDepthcodep  pAs you can see, its not really a global function call at all, but a call to a toplevel or more toplevel parent that happens to contain the function needed. In my test cases, this works just fine even as I add internal content components to the windows. However, when adding a Google Map as the windows content, clicking on the map type buttons results in an errorp  precodeReferenceError Error 1069 Property parentApplication not found on com.google.maps.wrappers. WrappableSprite and there is no default value. at WindowselectWindow[CUsersd04000196DesktopProjectsUI ConceptingErrorExamplesrcWindow.mxml18] codepre  pSo it appears that the Google Map API is attempting to call my code with the wrong context. Being new to FlexAir, I dont know how to bind the relevant context like one can do with Javascript. But that shouldnt be necessary.p  pIf there is a better way to create and call a truly global function and use the relevant global variable, this problem of the misaligned contexts wouldnt matter. Or, if there is a known solution for this particular issue with the Google Maps API, that might also work as a solution but wouldnt be as future proof.p  pThe below files are the minimum code required

Negative 4103 pIve got an SQLite database that will need to contain products.  Those products have a fixedformat composite product number, consisting of category, group and product number cccccc.gg.ppp.  Every time a new product is inserted, the new product number should be built using the category and group numbers, followed by the highest product number in that group incremented with one.p  pTo that end, I was thinking of storing all three numbers in separate fields, and use a view to dynamically assemble the product number.  For that to work, I would need to add leading zeroes, since the product numbers format is fixed.p  pHowever, I cant seem to find a builtin SQLite function which would let me do this... p  pId rather not write a custom function, since we might have to share the database with other developers, for them to read data from and I have no idea what platform or language theyre going to use.p  pCan this be done  Or will we have to find a different solutionp

Negative 4103 pthis problem has been doing my head in and I hope you can help Ive found the answers to a number of issues here before and hoping you people can work your magic again p  pOk so part of my app uses the Google Maps API to display an overlay on the map using a custom overlay class as well as the users location using mylocationoverlay. Now if I dont activate the mylocationoverlay everything works fine but if its activated then the app force closes with a codeConcurrentModificationExceptioncode. p  pNow the timer is used to refresh the overlay as its position is always changing. For this I used an async task to remove the overlay and add a new one with the updated position. Am I correct to assume the mylocationoverlay does a similar thing in the background If that assumption is valid then I have come to the conclusion that the mylocationoverlay and my async task are attempting to iteratemodify the same array at the same time. The only this is, I have no idea how to stop this from happeningp  pI cant really post my code here as its very big but I used an example code taken from github created by commonsguy and modified it to produce the same issue. p  pAny help would be greatly appreciated as this has been really really frustrating me.

Negative 4103 pIm working to establish a source control solution that will allow multiple vendors to contribute to a single project multiple Sitecore CMS sites in a single installation. Ideally wed like to go with TFS as it seems to fit our inhouse requirements and support best. Some of our vendors, however, prefer SVN. If we choose to go with TFS there seem to be a number of possible solutions to this.p  p1 Vendors commit to using TFS directly, using MS tools and CALse.g. Visual Studio for back end devs and tfs.exe etc for front end.p  p2 Vendors use TFS, plugging in with and adaptor to their current SVN tools SVN Bridge  SVN Tortoise  still requires a CAL per developer.p  p3 Vendors use a single CAL to establish a codebase from the TFS which they then use as an SVN repository. Vendors use SVN locally but use continuous integration between the SVN repository and the TFS to keep in synch.p  pThe third option looks cheaper in licensing terms, but would add considerable complexity and developer time in the synching, and would presumably lose checkin info on a per developer basis a single dev would check in all changes by his team to the TFS.p  pWe dont actually need a great level of detail and sophistication, just basic functionality. The vendors are responsible for their teams, we dont even really need to know who did what at that level, just that it came from vendor A or vendor B.p  pWhat are the relative drawbacks and benefits of the approaches above, and what tools would make my life easierp

Negative 4103 pIve inherited some JSP code that Im working on cleaning up, based on the warningserrors being given in Eclipse.  One of the common warnings is about a practice theyve been using to centralize configuration of the input field names, which Im given to understand is common.  Theyre using statically declared strings in the beans.  So for example, near the top we have the specific instance of the bean being defined and usedp  precodeltjspuseBean idmyBean scopesession classcom.company.package.MyBean gt lt   String[] sequence        myBean.getSequence   HashMap  statusLabelMap  myBean.getStatusLabels gt codepre  pbut then later on, static properties from the beans class are also used, in a nonstatic wayp  precodeltlabel forltmyBean.MODSTARTgtgtStart Withltlabelgt ltselect nameltmyBean.MODSTARTgt idltmyBean.MODSTARTgtgt codepre  pHeres the declaration for MODSTART in the bean itselfp  precodepublic static final String MODSTART       modStart codepre  pClearly the correct way to access MODSTART is MyBean.MODSTART, not myBean.MODSTART.  However, given the way the bean instance is being created, this syntax doesnt work.  I could addp  precodelt page importcom.company.package.MyBean gt codepre  pand then change the static property accesses.  But me being a relative lightweight for JSP coding, Im wondering if this is the most correct way to address this problem.  Or should I just let it go and leave the accesses using the nonstatic syntax  Id appreciate any guidance you can offer on best practices to cover this case.p

I can find the relevant row by searching the map, but how do I handle this nicely, so I dont have to start iterating through table columns and comparing the values of the cells to the variables of the object to see whether there are any differencesp  pBasically, i want to send a Stock object to the TableModel and update cells if there are changes and do nothing if there arent. p  pAny ideas about how to implement a TableModel that might do this Any pointeres at all would be appreciated. p  pThanks.p  pEdit p  pimport javax.swing.table.AbstractTableModel import ppwebsitemonitor.views.OrderTableModel.p  ppublic final class QuoteTableModel extends AbstractTableModel p  precode Attributes String[] columnName  new String[]Stock, Quantity, Price, Side, Status Class[] columnClass          new Class[]String.class, Integer.class, Double.class, String.class, String.class Object[][] rows  null  public QuoteTableModel    public QuoteTableModelObject[][] orders      this.rows  orders   public int getColumnCount      return columnName.length   public boolean isNewint row      return rows[row][4].equalsOrderStatus.NEW   public boolean isFilledint row      return rows[row][4].equalsOrderStatus.FULLYFILLED   public boolean isCancelledint row      return rows[row][4].equalsOrderStatus.CANCELLED   public void updateOrderPriceint row, Double newPrice       Object[] order  rows[row]     order[2]  newPrice     super.fireTableRowsUpdatedrow, row   public void updateOrderStatusint row, int status       Object[] order  rows[row]     order[4]  OrderStatus.States[status]     super.fireTableRowsUpdatedrow, row   public Object getValueAtint row, int col      return rows[row][col]   public int getRowCount      return rows.length   public String getColumnNameint col      return columnName[col]   public Class getColumnClassint col      return columnClass[col]  codepre  pp

Negative 4103 pIn a .Net project in which Im using NHibernate, I have a piece of code that build a list of expression trees depending on the values set in the filter by the user in the UI. The expression is build against a specific object of my domain model, lets say Customer. When I wanna create a filter criteria for a property of Customes, everythings fine, like in the following examplep  precodeExpressionltFuncltModel.Customer, boolgtgt expr  c gt                     c.Name  My Company codepre  pBut now, I need to create an expression that let me filter che customer based on a condition involving a one to many relation... lets say Order.

Negative 4103 pIm building an ASP.NET website to allow import of some tennis scores. I plan to have a line of textboxes for Player 1 and a line for Player 2 which allow for the scores to be input.p  pMy first task is to validate that the scores entered are valid. I could do this in code behind in an AJAX updatepanel so it happens seamlessly but Im wondering if I could do it with client side validation and jquery. Is this more efficient or less efficient than taking up server time to handle it The code would need to loop through the two textboxes for each set score and ensure that one of the players had 6 or 7 games and was 2 more games than the other player. If not its either a tiebreak in which case a pair of hidden tiebreak textboxes would need to be shown or the score is not valid and the text boxes need to be restyled to highlight it.p  pIs this viable If so Id welcome any pointers to get me going. Ive done little javascript jquery to date.p

Negative 4103 pI use a Tkinter window to visualize some output of my programm. The window is threaded see basic structure below and basically it works quite fine. So far, I only have trouble closing the window. When I clicke the X button for closing the window it works.p  pHowever, when I call the Monitor.close method from the main programm that starts the monitor thread, the window just freezes e.g., it doesnt react on clicking the X button and the thread monitor keeps running. Thus, the main program does not exit.p  pSo, at the moment, I also have to close first the window manually by clicking the closing button and then the main program. Not a big issue, but it would be great, if the main program could close the window by itself.

Negative 4103 pI need to define a read and a print function for a class that has an array of objects as a private variable. I have to read in objects from a text file and print them to the screen.

I read about Pool, Threads, Queues etc. but I am completely lost.p  pWhat I want to do with multiprocessing is that, convert my humble http downloader, to work with multiple workers. What I am doing at the moment is, download a page, parse to page to get interesting links. Continue until all interesting links are downloaded. Now, I want to implement this with multiprocessing. But I have no idea at the moment, how to organize this work flow. I had two thoughts about this. Firstly, I thought about having two queues. One queue for links that needs to be downloaded, other for links to be parsed. One worker, downloads the pages, and adds them to queue which is for items that needs to be parsed. And other process parses a page, and adds the links it finds interesting to the other queue. Problems I expect from this approach are first of all, why download one page at a time and parse a page at a time. Moreover, how do one process know that there are items to be added to queue later, after it exhausted all items from queue.p  pAnother approach I thought about using is that. Have a function, that can be called with an url as an argument. This function downloads the document and starts parsing it for the links. Every time it encounters an interesting link, it instantly creates a new thread running identical function as itself. The problem I have with this approach is, how do I keep track of all the processes spawned all around, how do I know if there is still processes to running. And also, how do I limit maximum number of processes.p  pSo I am completely lost. Can anyone suggest a good strategy, and perhaps show some example codes about how to go with the idea.p

Negative 4103 pI am attempting to populate a list of links depeding on what checkbox options are checked by a user. You can see what I have done so far here to give you an idea of what I am doing a hrefhttpdev.perfectdaycanada.comfilter relnofollowhttpdev.perfectdaycanada.comfiltera   the problem I am having is that I cant seem to get the checkboxes to populate links if only a county or a farm is selected. So at the moment one of the first set of checkboxes must be selected for the subsequent ones to work. Ideally any checkboxes ckecked should populate the list of links.p  pAny help would be much appretiated.p  pThanksp

Negative 4103 pI have a main.xml which I open in the Safari browser. It is processed just fine by the XSL file indicated at the top.p  pI have some javascript on the resulting page which should take a second XML file and process it using the given XSL in the href call.p  pThe XSL on the second file, category.xml, seems to work fine as evidenced by the alert but when it is inserted as a child to the contentbody div, it does not render as expected.p  pTo show what it should look like, I copied the output of the second XSL process, from the alert dialog, into the originally rendered contentbody div. It looks fine, just like a ul element should produce. When replacing it with the XSL output, it is very wrong.p  pI would really appreciate some help with this. Why is Safari Mac OS Lion and iPad mobile Safari not rendering the inserted HTML output by the XSL executed in Javascript properly How should I fix thisp  pThank you,p  pMatt.p  pmain.xmlp

Negative 4103 pThe site is about special discount events. Each event contains a period of time dates to be more precise that it is valid.

This requires the application code to calculate invalid dates upfront.p  pDoes anyone know of a better pattern to fit this requirement, or possible pitfall for my design This requirement is like a subset of a general calender model, because it does not require infinite repeating events in the future i.e. each event has a definite duration.p  pstrongUPDATEstrongp  pMy coworker suggested to have a periods table with start and end dates.

Negative 4103 pThe tableview I am implementing is a kind of phonebook, where I have an entryname and below that I am displaying hisher phone numbers. These data make my cell.  An entryname can have multiple phone numberseach phone number displayed in different lines. Against each phone numberin the same line I have an option to set some status message. How can I implement this.p  pThe way I have gone forward is I have created a 2 labels inside a cell. One for displaying the name and the other for displaying the numbers. These numbers are displayed in a multiline way. The problem I am facing is, adding the status message against each phone numberin the same row of each number. For that I may have to add the status as text in between the phone numbersdisplayed in a multiline way in the same label or I have to add another label inside this label. I am a bit confused regarding, how to go about this. Need help.p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comYB10V.png altenter image description herep

Negative 4103 pI am creating a data heavy application that needs to display several pieces of data and allow rows of that data to be selected for a more detailed view.  The application is destined for an iPad not an iPhone.p  pThe data is best suited for a grid layoutthere is multiple pieces of information and none is necessarily more important than the other data.  In other words, Im struggling to come up with a logical way to display it within the default single column world of a UITableView.  p  pHeres the question  should I suck it up and teach myself what appears to be the difficult task of subclassing UITableView and trying to use multiple views to create multiple columns or, should I just use a UIWebView, create a traditional HTML table, and capture clicks of rows of the table as events to spawn a new view.  I presume the latter option is possible  p  pIve looked at some of the available open source grid classesbut, they all seem a bit limited either in ascetics or in functionality i.e., being able to click on rows like a UITableView.  p  pIm starting to feel like Im treating the iPad like a glorified web browser, but, the limited text formatting and table formatting options within iOS is feeling pretty limiting.  But.. its hard to deny how easy HTML is to work withand, for a casual programmer, Im tempted by the lazy route.p  pId like to get peoples sense on what would be the best or acceptable practice.p  pThanks.  p

For instance I want codeC2, C3, C4.code The rest are extra information I dont care about.p  pNow someone might upload a file that has this headerp  precodeC1 C2 C3 C4 codepre  pAgain I am looking only for codeC2, C3, C4code.p  pI know I can have multiple formats but what I am getting at is I want them to be able to basically upload any file with any number of headerscould be 1000 for all I care and then have my application try to find the information I care aboutso in the case of the 1000 headers I maybe only want 3p  pIs this possiblep  pstrongEditstrongp  pbased on shamp00 commentsp  pMy goal is to fill in as much data as I possibly can determine, however cases like this might happen. I want C1, C2, C3. They give a file with C1,C3,C4. I got 2 columns of data I need but I dont have C2.p  pNow I had 2 ideas one was to display the data into 2 tables. Table 1 would have C1, C2, C3 and table 2 would have C1,C3,C4 and they basically take the data they have in table 2 and move the appropriate data into my expected columns.p  pWith this approach I am basically saying you did not give me 100 what I expected, now you have to format every single row into my format.p  pThe second approach would be 1 table and try to fill in as much data as possible. p  pFor example the user upload the file that has C1,C3,C4. I determine that their are 2 columns that are known but I dont have the full amount of expected data yet.p  pSo I would display all the rows back in a html table to the user with headers of p  precodeC1, C2, C3, C4 codepre  pC1 would be filled in, C2 cells would be blank as this is the data I am missing from them, C3 would be filled in, C4 would be filled in with this data was unexpected but who knows it might actually be the data C2 should hold but since they misspelled the header name my program could not figure it out.p  pThen essentially they would just fill in C2 with data they got from somewhere else or maybe from C4.p  pNow they only have to fill in 1 column in instead of all the columns that where expect. So in a sense I need a concrete class like MyClass was with C1,C2,C3 but at the same time I need to dynamic so I can hold codeC4,C5.....Cncode.p  pI would always display C1,C2,C3 first and the rest of these unexpected ones would come after and through the magic of javascript and stuff they could edit the missing info. If nothing is missing they nothing would show up to be edited.p  pBased on shamp00 comments I am now wondering if I need to return the data as a Data Tablefortunately this seems to be a system class as right now my code is in a service layer and I was return back a Domain Transfer Class as I want to keep my code independent from like web code classes and hence why I was trying to figure out how to the dynamic class FileHelpers generated..p  pThen somehow not 100 sure yet just keep track where those 3 columns I am really interested are so I know which data is what.p

Negative 4103 pWe recently adopted the TPL as the toolkit for running some heavy background tasks.p  pThese tasks typically produce a single object that implements codeIDisposablecode. This is because it has some OS handles internally. p  pWhat I want to happen is that the object produced by the background thread will be properly disposed at all times, also when the handover coincides with application shutdown. p  pAfter some thinking, I wrote thisp  precode    private void RunOnUiThreadObject data, ActionltObjectgt action              var t  Task.Factory.StartNewaction, data, CancellationToken.None, TaskCreationOptions.None, uiThreadScheduler         t.ContinueWithdelegateTask task                              if task.IsCompleted                                      DisposableObject.DisposeObjecttask.AsyncState                                                codepre  pThe background codeTaskcode calls codeRunOnUiThreadcode to pass its result to the UI thread. The task codetcode is scheduled on the UI thread, and takes ownership of the codedatacode passed in. I was expecting that if codetcode could not be executed because the ui threads message pump was shut down, the continuation would run, and I could see that that the task had failed, and dispose the object myself. codeDisposeObjectcode is a helper that checks if the object is actually IDisposable, and nonnull, prior to disposing it. p  pSadly, it does not work. If I close the application after the background task codetcode is created, the continuation is not executed. p  pI solved this problem before. At that time I was using the Threadpool and the WPF Dispatcher to post messages on the UI thread. It wasnt very pretty, but in the end it worked. I was hoping that the TPL was better at this scenario. It would even be better if I could somehow teach the TPL that it should Dispose all leftover AsyncState objects if they implement IDisposable. p  pSo, the code is mainly to illustrate the problem. I want to learn about any solution that allows me to safely handover Disposable objects to the UI thread from background Tasks, and preferably one with as little code as possible. p

When I got home I decided to try it on my hexcore modern gaming PC, and this is where we get our first issues.p  pI first adapted the code to run on Windows since that is what the gaming PC was using, but was saddened to find that the process was only getting about 15 of the CPUs power. I figured that must be Windows being Windows, so I booted into a Live CD of Ubuntu thinking that Ubuntu would allow the process to run with its full potential as it had done earlier on my laptop.p  pHowever I only got 5 usage So my question is, how can I adapt the program to run on my gaming machine in either Windows 7 or live Linux at 100 CPU utilisation Another thing that would be great but not necessary is if the end product can be one .exe that could be easily distributed and ran on Windows machines.p  pThanks a lotp  pP.S. Of course this program didnt really work with the Crays 8 specialist processors, and that is a whole other issue...

Negative 4103 pI am considering making a very simple form for clients to use in a sort of web browser kiosk fashion, where they submit some of their information through the computer in the lobby at their option instead of writing something out by hand.

Negative 4103 pHopefully I am overlooking a something simple.p  pI have tablix control with a table row in it.  I have it set to can grow as is necessary, it works great.   The only problem I have is that when the row grows, when printed, the entire table contents matches the row height of the row that grew.   So single spaced lines now appear to be doublespaced which is unnecessary for this report.   We want to keep it as small as possible.   Sure we can tinker with the spacing of the fields in the row but the minute we get data that is a character too big, that will end the reports usefullness.p  pLet me know if there is something I can do.  Either setting or code wise.   Again, on screen it appears fine, but when printed the rows grow to match regardless of any settings.p

It gave this error codeopen3 openGLOB0x610920, gtampmainOUT failed Invalid argumentcode. Why soli liIt seems that only one of the filehandles can write at a given time, and if I discard the handle thats holding on to the resource, the other handles keep on waiting.

This C program is basically a stub I wrote to interface with drivers and a bunch of APIs. Its practically empty in terms of complexity as it only used as a single entry point for hidden mechanisms, but its a few thousand lines long.p  pMe and my internship tutor have diverging opinions about how this should be done p  p1 The application and the modified framework clients communicate with the C program using sockets, and the C program is turned into a daemon server. The framework doesnt use any JNI rather java sockets and the applications might need to keep using a JNI implementation of sockets didnt try java sockets yet for a .apk. This has been tested to work.p  p2 Both the framework and the applications make calls to the C program, used somewhat like a library. This means IMO that we either exec from java bad or implement the whole code 2000 lines, for now inside the JNI.p  pMy biased opinion on this  1p  precode its proven to work  there is a clear separation between lowlevel and highlevel  there might be no JNI usage  because I use a C daemon, I can simulate the behaviour on x86 using an environment provided by the manufacturer  architecture is somewhat complex  depending on whether the .apk can use a java socket or not, the framework and the .apk wont use the exact same mechanisms to interface with the daemon java socket and JNI C socket codepre  p2p  precode architecture would be simple with the whole C in the JNI  maintaining is going to be a pain  its not simulable, development has to either be on target or on emulator  the android FW has to use JNI couldnt make this work so far because of a libc error  useless use of JNI from what I understand, should be used for heavy calculationslowlevel interfacing codepre  pWhats the correct Android way of doing this  Does one method seem more elegant than its counterpart p

Negative 4103 pSo what I am trying to do with this view is make it so that i can slide the UIView menuView up and down in and out of the screen.

Negative 4103 pI have a Java application that uses WebRenderer for a java headless browser. WebRenderer does not require xserver to run and I have confirmed this by uninstalling all x11 libs and xserver components. p  pHowever the problem is it throws an error codeGtkWARNING  cannot open displaycode in certain conditions. Upon research I found that it usually throws that error with systems that have openJDK installed. Also when the current java version is from Sun but openJDK is still installed. To fix it I would need to uninstall codelibatkwrapperjavacode and codelibgtk2.00code which also removes codedefaultjrecode, codecedteanetxcode, codelibatkwrapperjavajnicode, codelibgtk2.0bincode, and codeopenjdk6jrecode.p  pIt also throws the same error in openSUSE with Java from Sun. Would there be any way to fix this error without having to start up xserver or uninstalling a bunch of components that could be required for something else Any help is appreciated.p

Negative 4103 pI have search for quite some time now and found a good amount of old resources that at one point were working solutions to my current issue.

Im guessing what I have is probably incomplete.p  pHere is my relevant axis generation codep  precodeCPTAxis yRight  [[CPTXYAxis alloc] init] yRight.Title  Right Axis yRight.titleOffset  10.0f yRight.axisLineStyle  axisLineStyle yRight.majorTickLineStyle  axisLineStyle yRight.minorTickLineStyle  axisLineStyle yRight.labelTextStyle  axisTextStyle yRight.labelOffset  3.0f yRight.majorIntervalLength  CPTDecimalFromFloat10.0f yRight.minorTicksPerInterval  5 yRight.minorTickLength  5.0f yRight.majorTickLength  7.0f  axisSet.axes  [NSArray arrayWithObjectsx, yRight, yLeft, nil] self.hostView.hostedGraph.axisSet  axisSet  Next two lines are in charge of right aligning y axis axisSet.yAxis.axisConstraints  [CPTConstraints constraintWithUpperOffset0] axisSet.yAxis.tickDirection  CPTSignPositive this is commented out because I havent found it to do anything, though may be necessary for it to work once complete.

Negative 4103 pI have an app on the market which supports widgets.  Ive made some heavy changes to the app, reworking a lot of the internals, replacingrenaming activities, etc.  Other changes include sourcing the widget configuration data from different shared preference keys, though Ive written conversion code to handle the migration.  The app works as I wish it to, including the widgets, when installed from fresh.  However, Im now testing upgrading from an old version of the app to a new one via emulators.  Im seeing some bizarre behaviour.  On one occasion the widget appeared OK on initial launch, but when clicked on tried to launch an old activity rather than the new one Ive programmed.  So first question is, why didnt the widget update to the new code on app installp  pThe rest of my attempts at testing the upgrade have caused existing widgets to disappear entirely on a new version install.  What could be causing this  Nothing of note appears in the logcat logs. Any suggestionsp

Overwriting codetoStringcode of codeFunction.prototypecode is not an option, changing codefunccode to an object is also not possible since it might brake compatibility with older parts of the code.p  pstrongEditstrong The attempts made above are obviously not working since I am overwriting the codetoStringcode of the function codefunccode and not the codetoStringcode of the returned function. Now a better question Is there an elegant way to overwrite the codetoStringcode of all functions that are returned by codefunccode so that they share the same codetoStringcode. Means I dont have to specify the codetoStringcode for every returned function.p

Negative 4103 pAs a number of people have noted and encountered codeHashMap.putcode can go into an infinite execution loop when used concurrently see a hrefhttpjava.netjirabrowseGRIZZLY1207GRIZZLY1207a, a hrefhttpsissues.jboss.orgbrowseJGRP525sscctJGRP525a, possibly a hrefhttpshibernate.onjira.combrowseHHH6414HHH6414a, and this SO a hrefhttpstackoverflow.coma1003237277307answera.p  pcodeHashMapcode is clearly documented as not thread safe.  Obviously, the correct fix is to use a threadsafe implementation of codeMapcode, codeConncurrentHashMapcode in particular.  Im more curious about the concurrent timing that causes the infinite loop.  I encountered this loop recently with a Java 7 JRE and would like to understand the exact causes.  For example, is this caused by multiple puts at the same timep  pA look inside a hrefhttpgrepcode.comfilerepository.grepcode.comjavarootjdkopenjdk7b147javautilHashMap.javaHashMap.put28java.lang.Object2Cjava.lang.Object29HashMap.puta shows that codeHashMap.Entrycode contains a link to the next node in the bucket.  I assume these links are getting corrupting to contain circular references, which is causing the infinite loop.  However, I still dont understand exactly how that corruption is occurring.p

Negative 4103 pAs written in the pdf Adaptive Payments it is statedp  pIf you allow a third party to PayPal to execute an application on your behalf, the third party becomes the API caller because the party is now calling the Adaptive Payments API. The third party must also have permission from PayPal to use the advanced service. For example, if an application supports chained payments, both you and the third party must have permission to use the service.p  pWhen third party executes application on my behalf If I own my API keys I assumed I was always the API caller. What did Paypal mean by that p
Negative 4103 pFor a project I need to make a flashgame with the Kinect for Xbox. Using the AS3NUI library to get acces to most of the Kinect functions worked well for me.p  pIts a pong game where you have to move your paddle vertically through hand movement. Ive tried a few ways of moving the paddle, but none of them is really accurate. And if they are more accurate, they arent smooth at all anymore.p  pMy first methode was setting the paddle.y to the value of the hand.y.p  precode paddleLeft.y  userLeft.leftHand.position.y codepre  pOf course the result was terrible. This was my next tryp  precode paddleLeft.y  userLeft.leftHand.position.rgbRelative.y  stage.stageHeight2 codepre  pThis was pretty accurate, but not smooth at all, and sometimes it was very hard to reach the top of the stage, or the bottom.p  pAt last, I tried something else. I saved the hands last Y position, and checked if the new position was higher or lower, and on that I moved the paddle up or down. p  precode currYLeft  userLeft.leftHand.position.rgb.y  currYRight  userRight.rightHand.position.rgb.y  if currYLeft gt prevYLeft  10     isDown1  true     isUp1  false else if currYLeft lt prevYLeft  10     isDown1  false         isUp1  true   prevYLeft  userLeft.leftHand.position.rgb.y     prevYRight  userRight.rightHand.position.rgb.y codepre  pIn another enterframehandler, I make them move up or down.p  pThis is the most smooth way I achieved, but it isnt very accurate anymore. There is some kind of delay wich you dont have with the first two ways. p  pI would like to know if it is possible to make the movement smooth AND accurate at the same time And how this is possible.p

Negative 4103 pI am transforming a large xml document with the XSLT engine of Firefox. When this file is too large for Firefox, the browser just freezes much earlier in Mac Os  i7 than in a Windows  core 2 duo, surprising. p  pAs a way to make easier the process, I have splited the xml file in small parts, transforming them serially. This has improved things and velocity a lot. However, when the file is still large, I have the same symptoms.p  pNow, what I think is happening is that the transformToFragment function is asynchronous. It means that I am starting the following transformation before the previous one has finished, and at the end it blocks the browser and actually the computer as well.p  pThen, I cannot find any event that I could rely on before continuing with the process. Does anybody have any idea of how to do itp  pThanksp

For problem 67 it worked maverlously, but this time it stops working after the second iteration I have to perform the algorithm on multiple continued fractions.p  pThis is the piece of code I used an external module, namely sympyp  precodeimport time from sympy import  from sympy import fraction, Rational, Symbol  def contfracttofractioncontfraclist     acontfraclist[1]     bcontfraclist[2]     newreducedRationalb,1 Rational1,a     contfraclist[2]newreduced     del contfraclist[1]     if lencontfraclist1         print contfraclist To check         return contfraclist     else         contfracttofractioncontfraclist  def numeratorhigherdenominatorfraction     numstrfraction[0]     denstrfraction[1]     if lennumgtlenden         return 1     else         return 0  starttime.time  tally0  for k in xrange 1, 101     sqrteval[1]     for x in xrange 1, k2         sqrteval.append2     sqrtevalcontfracttofractionsqrteval     print sqrteval To double check     fractionresultfractionsoln[0] To introduce later     tallynumeratorhigherdenominatorfractionresult To introduce later  elapsedtime.timestart  print Solution , tally, Solved in , elapsed codepre  pI basically test just to see if it gets all the final fraction and the print from the function, before the return, gives the answer, but the print after I assigned the value to sqrteval prints None. Here is a test runp  blockquote precodeTest run [32] gt function print [32] gt sqrteval print [75] None [1712] None [4129] None [9970] None [239169] None [577408] None [1393985] None [33632378] None [81195741] None [1960113860] None codepre blockquote  pIve been searching thouroughly for an answer and cant quite find one.

Negative 4103 pSo, I have to develop a web component with a help of CQ5 a CMS in Java based on OSGi, Sling, JCR Content Repositoryp  pThis component should do the following Collect answers to three questions from the user, and then, based on those answers of the user, the response from the database will be provided to the user one could say its a calculatorp  pThe first question has 5 variants of answers, the second has 5 variants, and the third has also 5 variants.p  pBut the problem is, if the user has selected, say, option 1 as an answer to the first question, the number of possible answers the second question will be decreased  there will be only 3 possible answers left. p  pFor example, a user has questions Which country are you from Which state are you from Which city are you fromp  pIf the user answers Canada to the first question, he will then be able to choose only Canadian states as an answer to the second question.p  pSo, on event when the form is changed by the user, the data in it should be updated through ajaxp  pSo, the question is is it better to get all the data at once from the database there is not so much of it as you see, or is it better to make a request to database on each formchanging event Or maybe, it doesnt make any differencep  pTo my point of view, the second variant is better from the point of view of amount of code needed to be written, but whats better from the performance point of viewp

Negative 4103 pI do not have much experience with Python and need to figure out a few things regarding bufferingp  pI want to generate a list in which I can allocate a certain amount of buffer space do not know the specifics on this, to generate a list of integers.

Negative 4103 pI have a classic ASP application that uses a SQL backend.  The app used Access until earlier this week, when I changed it to try to resolve this problem, to no avail.  The problem is that the users leave the site open in IE all day long, and may take an hour or more between uses.  After its been sitting open for a while, when they try to make a request, the site hangs and eventually shows page can not be displayed.  If they hit the back button, then refresh the page, it works fine.p  pI just changed the app pool from Integrated to Classic, so that might fix it, but if anyone has any other ideas, I welcome them.  There is one other site on IIS 7.5 and while a user is experiencing this hang, there is no large resource usage on the server.p  pAlso, Ive turned on Failed Request Tracking for anything that runs over 3 seconds.  I get log files when these hangs happen, but they say that the request returned status code 200, but it always seems to stop in the log at NOTIFYMODULESTART  IsapiModule, Notification 128, Notification EXECUTEREQUESTHANDLER.

Negative 4103 pWe have a complex report that includes several calculations at different levels.p  pWhat I want to do is create a formula that says, if any of the records at this level fulfill this condition, then colour the header in the level above red.  p  pNormally I would do this by creating a formula lets call it ConditionFulfilled that says if condition fulfilled, print 1, else 0, then in the higher group, if ConditionFulfilled 1 then crred.  p  pHowever, I cant summarize the Condition field because its based on something that is already a summary.p  pIf I just use a formula that says if condition fulfilled, then crred at the header level, it doesnt colour any of the headers red because the condition isnt fulfilled in all cases while a  statement is colouring everything red even if the condition isnt fulfilled. p  pHas anyone encountered this problem with summaries before  Can you suggest a workaround that will allow me to achieve the same effect without summarizing a summaryp  pThank you. p
Negative 4103 pI have a program launching about 12 threads on 8core server. some of the threads are waiting for critical data. where its using a recv in loop, the recv will block until data comes.

Negative 4103 pI googled the heck out of this and never found a suitable answer. What Im trying to figure out is how much data flows between SSRS and the SQL server.

I run a report that returns thousands of rows that are then aggregated in SSRS report. Obviously, the source query runs on the SQL server. What Im not sure about is where those results are processed e.g. aggregates computed. Is it done on the SQL server e.g. does the output get written to temp tables on the SQL server and then all processed therep  pIs it passed back to the SSRS server and done there.p  pWhen I have drilldown reports that are collapsed by default, is a round trip to the server required when I drill down expand a section, or is the data in the client and just not visiblep  pIm sure there must be some documentation out there, just cant find it.p  pRegardsp  pmarkp

Negative 4103 pIve written an application which is rendering video into a texture basically using the code found in many posts here. I guess the original comes from some nVidia samples VideoSurfaceView found here a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions6414003usingsurfacetextureinandroid1499964814999648Using SurfaceTexture in Androidap  pThis example works perferctly fine on a mobile device and on a tablet  both based on a Tegra. Ive then tried the same code on a MALI 400 based android system Minix Neo5 and I can see that the video plays but I get mainly a black screen with some garbage on it just 3 or 4 linesp  pIve tried to use the OpenGL ES tracer to check what is copied from the SurfaceTexture back to the texture itself but it looks like the Tracer cannot show it correctly neither on the tegra systems nor on the tegra devices. Note that I dont get any OpenGL error nor any warnings whatsover. It looks like everything is working fine.p  pIs there any other tool that can show me what if anything is copied to the TEXTUREEXTERNAL  All TEXTURE2D are available on the tracer.p  pOne strange thing Ive noticed on the MALI system is that it cant play highdef videos at all. And my videos 1280x720 report on the debuger that they are using a SoftwareRenderer. Perhaps thats why the frames are not copied correctly to the OGLIMAGE that will be used as a texture. p  pI guess I need some better understanding of whats going on under the hood, but I expected an error telling the system cant do it or it should simply work, even if the performance is poor. Perhaps this is a modified version of android and the mediaplayer code is just broken...p
Negative 4103 pIm evolving a population of neural networks and Ive been struggling with normalizing fitness scores to values in range 0 to 1, so that the number on its own is most meaningful. The issue is that agents are tested under different conditions  they participate in different games, and for each game a different fitness function is used. Fitness functions look more or less like thisp  precodeagentsFitness[indiv][0]  Util.meanspeed  games[0].getConstant0  Math.sqrtMath.absspeed[LEFT]  speed[RIGHT]  games[0].getConstant1  Util.normalize0, 4000, maxIRActivation codepre  pbut each one will take different inputs. I can easily normalize numbers for each of them separately because I can estimate the maxima and minima of the input. Some of them will be in range of 30,000, 360,000 and some 0, 900.p  pPart that I find difficult is that the agents may be tested on two, three or more games at the same time, so their fitness score will be a sum of the scores on all of the games. Additionally, new games can be introducedevolved. Hardcoding normalizations min and max is not suitable here.p  pIf I try to use very large max and min, I end up with a scores in a range 0.40, 0.45 for the games that have smaller input values which hides the underlying diversity of the scores.p  pAny suggestions on how these fitness scores could be normalized will be greatly appreciated.p

Negative 4103 pIve got an Excel file that takes 10 inputs and outputs 5 numbers.

Negative 4103 pI am having difficulty getting multiplayer games to be multicomputer, not just multibrowser tabs. I went through the Real Time Multiplayer in HTML5 tutorial Build New Games, click a hrefhttpbuildnewgames.comrealtimemultiplayer relnofollowherea. It listens on port 4004, but I cant connect from my LANs other computer by visiting 192.168.1.44004, even though I can connect with my Apache web server on port 80 by visiting 192.168.1.4 Ive since disabled Apache and forwarding port 80 on my router, instead I forward port 4004. I used to connect to Apache from the outside world by visiting mydomain.com its DNS is hosted by my ISP. Now I cant connect from outside my LAN to my tutorial by visiting mydomain.com or mydomain.com4004. The tutorial uses node.js, socket.io, and express. You start it by entering codenode app.jscode in a terminal. You add a new player by visiting code127.0.0.14004code or code192.168.1.44004code. Here is the contents of app.jsp  precodevar     gameport         process.env.PORT  4004,     express          requireexpress,     UUID             requirenodeuuid,     verbose          false,     app              express   , http  requirehttp   , server  http.createServerapp   , io  requiresocket.io.listenserver   Express server set up.   The express server handles passing our content to the browser, As well as routing users where they need to go. This example is bare bones and will serve any file the user requests from the root of your web server where you launch the script from so keep this in mind  this is not a production script but a development teaching tool.      Tell the server to listen for incoming connections server.listen gameport       Log something so we know that it succeeded. console.logt  Express  Listening on port   gameport       By default, we forward the  path to index.html automatically. app.get , function req, res      res.sendfile dirname  index.html       This handler will listen for requests on , any file from the root of our server.     See expressjs documentation for more info on routing.  app.get  , function req, res, next            This is the current file they have requested     var file  req.params[0]          For debugging, we can track what files are requested.     ifverbose console.logt  Express  file requested    file          Send the requesting client the file.     res.sendfile dirname    file     Socket.IO server set up.   Express and socket.io can work together to serve the socket.io client files for you. This way, when the client requests socket.io files, socket.io determines what the client needs.      Create a socket.io instance using our express server var sio  io      Configure the socket.io connection settings.     See httpsocket.io sio.configurefunction       sio.setlog level, 0      sio.setauthorization, function handshakeData, callback        callbacknull, true  error first callback style            Enter the game server code. The game server handles     client connections looking for a game, creating games,     leaving games, joining games and ending games when they leave. gameserver  require.game.server.js      Socket.io will call this function when a client connects,     So we can send that client looking for a game to play,     as well as give that client a unique ID to use so we can     maintain the list if players. sio.sockets.onconnection, function client           Generate a new UUID, looks something like         5b2ca13264bd451399da90e838ca47d1         and store this on their socketconnection     client.userid  UUID          tell the player they connected, giving them their id     client.emitonconnected,  id client.userid            now we can find them a game to play with someone.         if no game exists with someone waiting, they create one and wait.     gameserver.findGameclient          Useful to know when someone connects     console.logt socket.io player   client.userid   connected          Now we want to handle some of the messages that clients will send.

Negative 4103 precently I wanted to start learning more low level types of programming from OS kernels to device drivers to embedded systems. A goal for me is to get a computer with no software at all on it to running some applications on it. It was recommended for me to buy a microcontroller board but not to use their APIs and library. I looked at a ton of them and a lot of forums but there are a lot of different answers but maybe I can narrow down what Im looking for. Cheap as possible. Has a decent amount of power. I think I want to stick with a 8bit or 16bit processor because I heard that 32bit processors are more complicated. Has good documentation on the actually chip and not just their APIs and library.

Negative 4103 pIm happy to accept that this might not be possible, let alone sensible, but is it possible to keep a persistent reference to an object I have createdp  pFor example, in a few of my views I have code that looks a bit like this simplified for clarityp  precodeapi  Webclient api.loginGPLAYUSER,GPLAYPASS url  api.getstreamurlstrack.streamid[0]  client  mpd.MPDClient client.connectlocalhost, 6600 client.clear client.addurl client.play client.disconnect codepre  pIt would be really neat if I could just keep one reference to codeapicode and codeclientcode throughout my project, especially to avoid repeated api logins with codegmusicapicode. Can I declare them in codesettings.pycode Im guessing this is a terrible idea, or by some other means keep a connection to them thats persistentp  pIdeally I would then have functions like codegetapicode which would check the existing object was still ok and return it or create a new one as required.p

Negative 4103 pSome say that FRP is about handling event streams without explicitly managing state. This person, for examplep  pa hrefhttpwww.slideshare.netborgesleonardofunctionalreactiveprogramminginclojurescript relnofollowhttpwww.slideshare.netborgesleonardofunctionalreactiveprogramminginclojurescriptap  pOthers motivate FRP by pointing out the difficulties of programming entirely by sideeffects, as one must do with asynchronous callbacks.p  pa hrefhttpcs.brown.eduskPublicationsPapersPublishedmgbcgbkflapjax relnofollowhttpcs.brown.eduskPublicationsPapersPublishedmgbcgbkflapjaxap  pHowever in experimenting with FRP flapjax, I keep hitting the same problem an inability to handle state, except explicitly, via sideeffects.p  pFor example, an animation queue. Changes arrive on an event stream. When the first change arrives, I need to queue a draw to happen some time in the future e.g. with window.requestAnimationFrame, and arrange to accumulate changes between now and the future draw event. When the draw event happens, I need to draw the accumulated changes.p  pThis is about six lines of code using an imperative style with observer pattern, but I cant find a reasonable way to express this in FRP. The only thing that comes close involves closing the related event streams over a shared state, and explicitly managing the state and rendering events via sideeffects. Its hardly an improvement on imperative callbacks.p  pHow is this supposed to be handled in FRPp  pHeres a flapjax utility for closing over statep  precodefunction worldEinit, handlers      var r  fj.receiverE     fj.forEachfunctionh          h[0].mapEfunction ev              r.sendEventinit  h[1]init, ev              , handlers     return r  codepre  pAnd here it is used in an animation loopp  precodefunction initializeopts      var blitE  fj.receiverE      function accumulatestate, data          if state.queued              window.requestAnimationFrameblitE.sendEvent                  return queued true, changes .extend, state.changes, data           function dodrawstate,           drawstate.changes         return queued false, changes            worldEqueued false, changes ,             [[opts.datasource, accumulate], [blitE, dodraw]]  codepre  pThings to note its larger, less readable and less maintainable than the equivalent callback code. It still requires explicitly managing state. And it operates via side effects.p  pIs there a better way of doing this in FRP A different pattern, or a different libraryp

Negative 4103 pOk so finding any material on codethiscode or codethiscode using any search engine is ridiculously hard. So I hope I havent missed something obvious.p  pBasically what Im trying to accomplish parsing of a clickd DOM object into a function and then operating recursively through that objects siblings and running some operators. you can find the code below along with a link to the live pagep  pAll the references Ive found thus far including a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions1051782jquerytthisa have involved calling builtin function on codethiscode such that codethis.findpcode however what Im trying to do is parse it as a parameter to my function thus codeinsertRowthiscode is this possible If not how can I use the above call style and access the object in my functionp  pHeres the code Ive got thus far. Ive included codeaddRowcode to show what Ive got working currently. And the works in progress are codeinsertRowrowcode and codeincrementRowsrowcode. I guess its also possible that Ive screwed up the layering of code.clickcode events in the document.ready area.

Negative 4103 pSome organizations have automated their telephone system so that messages can be sent via pushing the buttons on the telephone. The buttons are labeled with both numerals and letters as shownp  pNotice that certain letters are omitted, presumably for historical reasons. However, it is common to use  to represent letter q and  to represent letter z. Common schemes do not use a onetoone encoding of each letter. However, if we wanted such an encoding, one method would be to use two digits for each letter The first digit is the key containing the letter. The second digit is the index, 1, 2, or 3, of the letter on the key. For example, to send the word cat, wed punch 2 3 2 1 8 1 c a t An exception would be made for q and z, as the only letters on the keys  and  respectively. Give the dfa for communicating a series of any of the twentysix letters, where the input alphabet is the set of digits 1, ...., 9, ,  and the output alphabet is the set of available letters. Note that outputs occur only every other input. So we need a convention for what output will be shown in the transducer in case there is no output. Use  for this output.p

Negative 4103 pWith the asp.net MVC, we see a lot different view engines, like Razor, spark, webform etc. I thought the idea of MVC is separating of data and view, I assume view part should be something that allows a designer to do some work, even after it is created by a developer. But I see now most if not all view engines introduce new syntax, not stick with html. The old web form, you can use view designer to see how a page looks like even with some code blocks, designer could at least move blocks and html elements around, but now with engine like Razor, you cannot even view a page in designer mode. So I dont quite get what is the point This came to me when I tried to search for a server side templating that allows end user do some changes on the page. I perfer something stick to pure HTML, maybe Spark is the one, but I am not sure. Please someone can give me some idea.p  pThanksp

Negative 4103 pI have large database of annotations of images stored in an elasticsearch database. I want to use this database for keyword extraction. Input is text typically a newspaper article. My basic idea for an algorithm is to go through each term from the article and use elasticsearch to discover how frequent the term is in the image annotations. Then output terms from articles which are not frequent in order to prefer names of people or places over common English words.p  pI dont need something very sophisticated, these keywords are used just as suggestion for user input, but I want something faster then asking N search queries where N is number of terms in text to elasticsearch which can be slow on large texts. Is there some robust and fast technique for keyword extraction in elasticsearchp

Any Ideas would be greatly appreciated.p  pJust a note  My client thought the heart inside of a url would be cool and sent the letter by copying and pasting directly into the Constant Contact form.  Im assuming that CC takes the link and parses it using its own system and then rebuilding the link for tracking so as far as I can tell, linking with a Unicode Text Character is a big Do Not Try noone informed them of.  p  pIf the newsletter had not already been sent this would be a snap to fix but since its already out, the only thing I can do is try and find a way to direct the links to the right wordpress postsevents.   p

Negative 4103 pI am programming for the first time with BigDecimals.p  pWhy is the behaviour different in follwing two programsp  precode   1 BigDecimal d  new BigDecimal2.01.setScale4       System.out.printlnd       Gives me  2.0100    And      2 BigDecimal d  new BigDecimal2.01       d.setScale4   System.out.printlnd         Gives me  2.01 codepre  pWhy is this sop  pAlso I am having a functionality where I need to compare a row in CSV file with DB record record using some BigDecimal value.      DB columns have DB type as Decimal with different scales   e.g Quantity is the column with scale defined as 4.       when user enters value of quantity as 2 in CSV file it is retrieved as followsp  precode     BigDecimal q  new BigDecimal2      which gives me big decimal with scale as 0 and precision as 1 with value as 2. codepre  pwhen  I retrieve the same value from DB usingp  precode      rs.getBigDecimal54 where 54 is column index,    I get Big decimal with precision as 0 and scale as 4 with value as 2.0000 codepre  pNow As I have to compare hundreds of records in CSV in all the records in DB, I was thinking of creating SHA1 value of all the records in DB and compare it with SHA1 value of contents of CSV record.br         However I dont understand how to have same string representation of two bigdecimals with same value with different precision. I know 2 and 2.0000 are not technically same for computer but for users they are same.br  So I want to have same representation of them. I also tried calculating their hashcodes but they are also different which is right as they are altogether different numbers for computer.br  So how can I have 2 as BigDecimal being converted  to 2.0000 Bigdecimal so that I can get same String representation.p  pthis is really proving to be a blocker for mep

This is what I want to happen.  My question is can I always rely on this to workp  pIn code I am working on, we have this class hierarchy and in the b class there are macros used which static cast to the b type.

Negative 4103 pIm practicing my coding by remaking a game called Dope Wars using Python. If you arent familiar with Dope Wars, long story short  You travel from city to city buying and selling drugs. The goal is to make as much money as possible without being killed or arrested. Im starting out making the game to be played by command line and will code it into a GUI when Im done. The code Im posting has 2 cities available and 2 drugs to buy. The command line asks you which city you would like to go to, if you want to buy, what you want to buy, and how much. I got it to update the dictionary where I stored the values, but it doesnt save the value as you loop, and Im pretty sure its because of using .update, but I dont know what else to use. p  pSo Im basically looking for a way to keep the values in the inventory so they can be added to and taken from, bought and sold. I will also need to establish a money system, random police chases, a bank, a hospital, and a gun store, any help with those aspects will help greatly as well.p  pHere is what I have so farp  precodeimport random    Stores dope list with prices for each city nyDope  Heroin random.randrange1000, 2000, Coke random.randrange1000, 2000 laDope  Coke random.randrange1000, 2000   Stores references for cities to their dope list cityDict  New York nyDope, Los Angeles laDope    to print out dope list for NY def ny     for i in nyDope         printi     strnyDope[i]    To print out dope list for LA def la     for i in laDope         printi     strlaDope[i]  printPick your city city1  input if city1.lower.startswithn     ny elif city1.lower.startswithl     la else     printWrong answer, now you have to go to New York     ny  goAgain  True unitsHeroin  0 unitsCoke  0  while goAgain  True      inventory  Heroin intunitsHeroin, Coke intunitsCoke      printType what drug you want to buy     buyDrugs1  input     if buyDrugs1.lower  heroin         printHow many         boughtDrugs1  input     elif buyDrugs1.lower  coke         printHow many         boughtDrugs1  input     else         printThats not an option      if buyDrugs1.lower  heroin         inventory.updateHeroin intunitsHeroin  intboughtDrugs1     if buyDrugs1.lower  coke         inventory.updateCoke intunitsCoke  intboughtDrugs1      printHeroin   strinventory[Heroin], nCoke   strinventory[Coke]      printBuy more drugs yn     goAgain  input     if goAgain.lower.startswithy         goAgain  True     else         goAgain  False         break codepre

Negative 4103 pI know this is a dumb question, but Im not sure what I can do.  My program is to simply send a message through some servers. My program also has a console, which is just a JTextArea, to let the user know whats going on. For some weird reason, calling the append method takes a few seconds. In fact, it doesnt actually append until the message has been sent through the servers. Thats where Im lost.

Negative 4103 pWhen implementing a class that works like a set, one can inherit from codecollections.MutableSetcode, which will bestow the new class with several mixin methods, if you implement the methods they require. Said otherwise, some of the methods of a set can be implemented in terms of other methods. To save you from this boredom, codecollections.MutableSetcode and friends contain just those implementations.p  pa hrefhttpsdocs.python.org2librarycollections.htmlcollectionsabstractbaseclasses relnofollowThe docsa say the abstract methods arep  blockquote   pcodecontainscode, codeitercode, codelencode, codeaddcode, codediscardcodep blockquote  pand that the mixin methods arep  blockquote   pInherited codeSetcode methods and codeclearcode, codepopcode, coderemovecode, codeiorcode, codeiandcode, codeixorcode, and codeisubcodep blockquote  pAnd, just to be clear that codeupdatecode is not part of the Inherited codeSetcode methods, codeSetcodes mixin methods arep  blockquote   pcodelecode, codeltcode, codeeqcode, codenecode, codegtcode, codegecode, codeandcode, codeorcode, codesubcode, codexorcode, and codeisdisjointcodep blockquote  pHowever, codeSetcode refers to an immutable set, which naturally would not have codeupdatecode.p  pstrongWhy is codeupdatecode not among these methodsstrong I find it surprising  unintuitive even  that codesetcode contains this method, but codecollections.Setcode does not.

And sure thing, codeHttpContext.Currentcode is null. Its emnotem null when the codeSendEmailAsynccode is called inside the controller action, its not null after the await in the task continuation, but its null inside codeSendEmailAsynccode. p  pIm using the correct codeltsystem.webgtlthttpRuntime targetFramework4.5.1 gtltsystem.webgtcode  flags inside web.config, everything is by the book. And now, after updating emsomeem component  whether its a minor ASP.NET MVC version or ASP.NET Identity version  I dont know  codeHttpContext.Currentcode is null. p  pI have an ugly fix where I save the HttpContext.Current to a local var as my IdentityMessageService is created and set the current HttpContext to that value while SendAsync is executing, which works, but this definitely smells like a pretty serious regression inside the ASP.NET stack, somewhere. p  pHas anyone encountered anything similarp
Negative 4103 pThis is a followup to a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comq24691660245123820this20previous20questionthis previous questiona. So there you can find what I did so far.p  pIn short, I created a new codegitcode branch branching from a branch that is dcommited to a remote codesvncode repository. This new codegitcode branch is intended to only be used locally and never to be synchronized with the codesvncode. While I can ensure this manullay as explained in a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comq246916602451238this answera, the new codegitcode branch remembers its codesvncode originp  precode git svn info Path . URL [pathtohost][svnrepo]trunk Repository Root [pathtohost][svnrepo] Repository UUID [repositoryuuid] Revision [revision] Node Kind directory Schedule normal Last Changed Author sglecram Last Changed Rev [revision] Last Changed Date [date] codepre  pSo assume if I checkout the new codegitcode branch and commit some changes to the local codegitcode, I could run codegit svn dcommitcode sending the changes to the codesvncode. While I do not plan to do this, all it needs is to forget for a splitsecond on which branch I am on to publish all the secret changes in the secret git branch.p  pI would like to be able to unlink the new codegitcode branch from the codesvncode so that trying to dcommit from that branch results in an error. How can I do thisp

Negative 4103 pIm starting an embedded Jetty Server and using SelectChannelConnector for this. For legacy reasons I have to use Jetty 6.p  pIm unable to correctly simulate a connection close from the Servers end. On setting the connector.setMaxIdleTime to a very low value of around 20 ms, it still doesnt fail . p  pOn the client side Im reading a stream of data from the Jetty Server.p  pNote If I set the setMaxIdleTime value to around 10ms. The connection is correctly closed and I get an unexpected EOF from the Server, but this happens when The client side is parsing http headers. What I want to do is simulate the same behavior when Im reading the actual content.p

Negative 4103 pIm trying to export a HTML table to excel but unfortunately, I cant get it going.p  pI have a table that is populated from a database table based on the results of a previous pages filter form.

Ive tried storing the results again in a hidden form, and downloading via that doesnt work.

Negative 4103 pOkay so ive got a University assignment where I need to compress an image using both Runlength encoding and huffman encoding. Im focusing on the RunLength encoding atm since I dont think im going to have time to implement the huffman. p  pWhat I am currently doing is passing in a buffered image, Then doingp  precodepublic byte[] byteArrayBufferedImage image     ByteArrayOutputStream baos  new ByteArrayOutputStream     byte[] imageInByte  null     try         ImageIO.writeimage, BMP, baos         baos.flush         imageInByte  baos.toByteArray         baos.close     catchIOException e         System.out.printlne.getMessage           return imageInByte  codepre  pto get the bytes of the image. I then take that and do the actual compression, to do this atm Im using a stringBuffer which Im pretty sure is wrong but I cant think of another way to do it. so the code for that isp  precodepublic String getRunLength     StringBuffer dest  new StringBuffer             forint i 0 i lt imageByteArray.length i         int runlength  1         whilei1 lt imageByteArray.length ampamp imageByteArray[i]  imageByteArray[i1]             runlength             i                          dest.appendrunlength            dest.appendimageByteArray[i]           return dest.toString  codepre  pIm pretty sure I shouldnt be converting to a string since when I go back to the bytes then I will be getting the ascii values rather than the actual bytes. But I cant figure out how I would go about appending the run length to a standard Byte Array efficiently I think I could do it if I appended the run length to the start, then moved everything after byte[irunLength] down runLength amount in the array.. but that would be extremely inefficient and prone to error... probablyp  pI then need to save it as an image, which obviously isnt working at the moment but the code ive currently got for that isp  precode try         File newImage  new FileSaved.png         ImageIO.writerleImage, BMP, newImage     catchException e         System.out.printlnsomething fucked up      codepre  pThanks for any help you might be able to provide p  pJust noticed I missed out the part where I set the rleImage that is done likep  precode public BufferedImage stringToImageString runLengthEncode     ByteArrayInputStream bais  new ByteArrayInputStreamrunLengthEncode.getBytes     try         imageRLE  ImageIO.readnew ByteArrayInputStreamrunLengthEncode.getBytes     catchIOException e           decoderunLengthEncode     ifimageRLE  null         System.out.printlnimageRLE is null     return imageRLE  codepre

Negative 4103 pIn my MVC 5 EF Database First project I have been using UpdateModel method in my controller action successfully, but after including some additional fields previously unused by application I find that the new fields simply refuse to get values from the UpdateModel method call.

I have inspected both the codemodelcode and the codecollectioncode and they have the correct value, but the coderecordcode never gets the values stronguntilstrong I do a second post of the same data. Then the values get pushed in to the fields as expected.p  pI dont get any errors thrown and am at a bit of a loss as to what is going on. For the time being I have resorted to modifying my controller action to thisp  precode[HttpPost] public async TaskltActionResultgt EditRecordEditView model, FormCollection collection      if ModelState.IsValid              try                      var record  await db.Record.FindAsyncmodel.ID             UpdateModelrecord, collection             record.DetailsFile  collection[DetailsFile]  lt Manually insert DetailsFile value             db.Entryrecord.State  EntityState.Modified             await db.SaveChangesAsync                  catchException ex                      throw ex                    do more stuff here     ...  codepre  pAnd this works OK, however Im sure that I shouldnt have to do this, and hope that someone out there can explain what I am overlookingp

They included the following method example but did not state if this was meant to be an example within an Activity definition or a Fragment definition.  I was a little confused on this and wanted to ask for clearification.  based on the use of super it would suggest its inside the fragment getting passed up to the Activity, but this disagrees with their statement that the Activity gets called first.  If its meant to be an example in the Activity and super refers to the parent Application class, then I am not clear on how it gets referred back to the Fragment.

Negative 4103 pI have reviewed and implemented  tested all the messaging options with ServiceStack that I know of and Ive searched on and off for a long time.  The two are PubSub and RedisMQ.  Both of these have limitations that I needed to go beyond.  I have already done this and have a solution that works perfectly for my system.  The purpose of this posting  question is to see if I missed a better way, and a check on if my solution is really threadsafe.  So far it is working well and I think it is good.p  pWhat I did was create an exchange class, and then a pub class and a sub class. My need was to have an arbitrary number of publishers, in any number of threads, publish to an arbitrary number of subscribers, in any number of threads.  The only restriction is that my publisher and my subscriber can not be in the same thread, as this causes deadlock.  This is by design, so for me not a limitation, as I want blocking subscribers this could actually be changed with one line of code, but is not my application need and would actually be a negative.  Also note that the subscribers can be to unique publishers or any number of subscribers to the same publisher fanout.  This was the MQ limitation I needed to resolve.  The PubSub limitations were even greater, but lets not digress into why they did not solve my needs.p  pThe usage construct for what I call RedisMEnQ En  Enqueue because it uses Redis.EnqueueItemOnList is to instantiate the pub class for each publisher, and a sub class for each subscriber.  The pub and sub classes both own an instance of the exchange class, thus sharing the same exchange code.  There is no direct interaction between pub and sub classes except through Redis.

I didnt want to have unnecessary gaps in subscriber ids, so if a subscriber unsubscribes, the next subscriber will pick up the unused id.  I put the locks in so that a subscriber does not partly subscribe while a publisher is publishing.  Either the subscriber is fully subscribed or not at all.  p

Negative 4103 pIm new to CakePHP. Currently using cake 2.5. Also, Im a newbie in this great community. I hope I make the questions in the correct way p  pAfter reading and reading over the Internet and this community I still havent found a solution for my problem.p  h1The problemh1   pembIf you are in a hurry, read ONLY this section. If you arent in a hurry, you can find additional information about the exact context of my problem in the above section Additional Info.bemp  pIm developing a Cake application for reporting purposes which uses 2 databases a legacy MS SQL Server database which is used as readonly this is a must for getting data. And a regular MySQL database that will be used by the Cake application for storing reports, user prefs and some data related with some records of the readonly database. Sorry but I cant post any piece of code or real names of database tems because a nondisclosure agreement that I signed.p  pbThe Key Pointb I have a model with no table i.e codeuseTable  falsecode using a connection to the readonly database. Lets say bReadOnlyModelb.p  pbReadOnlyModelb gets data by running a custom query this is a must. I achieve that by using codethisquerysqlcode.p  pLets say the hardcoded MS SQL Server query by bReadOnlyModelb isp  precode SELECT      TABLEA.AID, TABLEA.ONESTRING,      TABLEB.PKCOL1, TABLEB.PKCOL2, TABLEB.PKCOL3,          TABLEB.ANEXTERNALID, TABLEB.ONECODE, TABLEB.ONEDATE,         TABLEB.ONENUMBER, TABLEB.ANOTHEREXTERNALID,      TABLEC.OTHEREXTERNALID  FROM SCHEMANAME.dbo.TABLEA TABLEA, SCHEMANAME.dbo.TABLEB TABLEB,      SCHEMANAME.dbo.TABLEC TABLEC  WHERE TABLEA.AID  TABLEC.AID AND TABLEA.PKCOL1  TABLEB.PKCOL1      AND TABLEA.PKCOL2  TABLEB.PKCOL2  ORDER BY TABLEB.PKCOL1, TABLEB.PKCOL2 codepre  pThe query runs ok and is getting correctly all the data. Despite there are bthreeb involved tables, for simplicity Im going to use only boneb Cake model to encapsulate the data because from the point of view of my Cake application, it doesnt make sense to interact with TABLEA, or with TABLEB or with TABLEC individually. Such joined records can be considered as unique entities in the Cake application side. p  pAt that point, I need to achieve that this bReadOnlyModelb behaves as a conventional and regular Cake model when dealing with common reading operations, i.e I need to be able to use all the Cake functionalities about finding, filtering, instantiating a model by ID and so on.p  pIs that possible What would be the right way I have read the Models and Paginator section of the official Cake book and I dont find the way.p  pIf it isnt possible, does it possible tu run the query and restructure the retrieved data array in a way than CakePHP expects For instance Something likep  precodeArray      [ReadOnlyModel] gt Array          [id] gt idvalue1         [field1] gt value1         [field2] gt value2         [field3] gt value3         ...           [ReadOnlyModel] gt Array          [id] gt idvalue2         [field1] gt value4         [field2] gt value5         [field3] gt value6         ...          ...  codepre  pAnd then assign that array to the codedatacode model property. Doing so, would act the Cake core as if the bReadOnlyModelb was a normal and regular codeuseTabletruecode model Would Paginator works normally and correctly in that case p  pIf it isnt possible, is there any way to override or hack some of the CakePHP core for getting the above mentioned behaviour p  pIf not or if that is not the right way, what alternative approaches could I follow Would it be implementing a custom Datasource a possible way to get successp  pThank you in advancep  pPS Sorry because I know my questions are very general, and no code samples are provided because of the above mentioned NDA. However, my question is more about coding techniques or specific programming problems regarding with CakePHP 2.5 capabilities and limitations. Sorry because of my english level, too.p  hr  h1Additional info  Clarifiying my context and needsh1   pembIf you arent in a hurry, you can find below additional details about my system, it context and it requirements and the reasons of many design decissions that Ive been forced to have made. Maybe, you can find here answers for your questions or doubtsbemp  ul lipThere is a really really BIG, MATURE, FULLYTESTED, HYPEROPTIMIZED, HIGHSCALED AND COMPLEX legacy system in production. In fact, is the biggest system I have ever faced. That system will act as a readonly master, as a huge readonly data provider.pli lipIm developing a Cake external application that only extracts several data from the master system, for reporting purposes mainly. pli lipBy requirement, there is bno possibility of altering that master system in any wayb at all. So I cant include there my own tables. Because of this, my Cake application will have its own mysql database for storing reports, user preferences and, in 45 cases, storing some data related with some records of the master system database that are needed in some reporting tasks.pli lipThe core of that master system is a huge MS SQL Server database which have more than 500 tables. Some of that tables are very large and wide for instance about 100K records and 120 columns . All table names and column names are not cakefriendly i.e capital letters and underscores everywhere. Besides, some tables have composite primary keys. pli lipThat master database is highly normalized, so there are tons of relations between tables, lots of levels of many to many relationships. For instance A hasManyAndBelongsTo B, B hasManyAndBelongsTo C, C hasManyAndBelongsTo D and D hasManyAndBelongsTo E, 4 levels. Besides, each of A, B, C, D and E tables have additional belongsToHasManyhasManyAndBelongsTo relationships with many many other tables.pli lipMy Cake application will be used ONLY for data extracting. Its not allowed any kind of operation that could finally introduce any modification in the state of the master system. DELETE or UPDATE querys are banned.pli lipThe Admin of the master system, will allow my Cake application to execute a set of previoysly known querys that I have to detail to him. I will provide him with a collection of query signatures that my Cake application will use and then he will made some kind of magic to include that querys in a whitelist for allowing execute them at the master system database. Additionally, he will do a number of perquery optimization tasks in order to speedup that querys.pli lipSo, that whitelist will be the only connection point between the master system and my Cake application. pli lipThe Admin of the master systems wants me to specify my list of query signatures, according to the next rules p  ul li1st I have to select which tables are needed in each queryli li2nd I have to select which existing schema columns will be used in each query. The  operator will not be allowed as column selector.li li3rd I can feel free to use any other kind of SQL stuff need in my querys such as aggregate functions, onthefly or calculated columns, conditions clause, using literal values, etc.li lip4th all the previus elements will be authorized. The rest denied.p  pE.g codeSELECT A.C1, B.C2 FROM A INNER JOIN B ON A.C3  B.C4code.      This signature let me operate ONLY with the A and B tables and with the C1, C2, C3, and C4 columns. Also, it would be possible to use aggregate functions, onthefly columns, and so on.p  pE.g codeSELECT A.C1, B.C2, A.C1  B.C2 AS NEWCOLUMN FROM A INNER JOIN B ON A.C3  B.C4code would be a valid query. NEWCOLUMN could be used.p  pE.g codeSELECT  FROM A INNER JOIN B ON A.C3  B.C4code will be rejectedpli ulli lipOnce I have defined my signatures querys, the rest of the database scheme not declared as needed will not be usable for my Cake application. Any future operation trying to access any table or column not declared in the whitelist will be denied. And any other query that is not contained in the whitelist will be rejected.pli ul  pbConclussionb I have to limit the automagically query creation capability of CakePHP for avoiding that CakePHP could try to execute unauthorized queries. So the queries executed against the master database have to be hardcoded although literals or injected values in the WHERE clause will be accepted.p

Negative 4103 pIm currently using Naudio to create a mixer with multiple inputs and multiple outputs. p  pFor each input, while the audio is playing, I would like to be able to add a sample sized delay whenever I choose to. The effect will be similar to pausing for, say 100 samples, and then playing again.  For example, a mixingSampleProvider is currently playing audio to output Channel 5, using multiplexingSampleProvider. On a certain button click, i would like to delay mixingSampleProvider by 200 samples, before it continues playing from the point it paused for a moment.p  pI would like to know if its possible to do so, and what options can be looked at to achieve this effect.p  pEdit  The specific problem which requires fixing, would be the knowledge gap I have in inserting Zeros to the buffer, while pushing all the rest of the samples back, while audio is playing. Here, Im not looking for code to be written, but am looking for resources to attempt to create a new class to solve this issue. Or whether it is even possible at all.p  pEdit 2 Code I have tried failedp  precode public int Readfloat[] buffer, int offset, int count              int sampleRead  source.Readbuffer,offset,count         int delaySamples  Math.Mincount, DelayBySamples  delayPos         float[] copyBuffer  buffer          for int n  0 n lt delaySamplesn                       buffer[offset  n]  0                  for int n  0 n lt sampleReadn                       buffer[offset  delaySamples  n]  copyBuffer[offsetn]                    delayPos  delaySamples         sampleRead  delaySamples           return sampleRead      codepre

Negative 4103 pMy question might sound too obvious but I am new to Amazon KMS.  After reading a lot of docs on AWS I understood that if I am using CMK directly for encryption and decryption I can directly do it by creating encrypt and decrypt request. But what I am not clear is when I generate a data key and debug using that,the documentation says I need to pass encrypted data key to decrypt API and I will get plain text key which I can use to debug text on my OWN. I dont understand this part. Can anyone please explain this and give a small example on decryption using data keys.

Negative 4103 pWhile building my SPA with angularJS, i came to the point where i want to implement user authentication in my angularJS website. However, i have no idea where to start and what the best practices are.p  pBasically i have a sure that can have one or more roles. Ive looked for examples so i could get a basic understanding of how to handle this properly, but so far ive only came across examples that are very simple or are not so secure like a hrefhttpjustinvoelkel.melaravelangularjsparttwologinandauthenticationthisa.p  pSo my question is, how to I implement a authentication service using REST or custom API urls to authenticate a user, and then display the user information on the page using angularJS, while also ensuring best security coverage by using for example the csrf token from Laravelp  pThanks in advance, Nick van der Meij p

Negative 4103 pOk, so before people start screaming DUPLICATE let me explain. I have spent the last few days trying to get some c code to be able to safely eject a USB key. I have been attempting to use the code from herep  pa hrefhttpwww.codeproject.comArticles13530EjectUSBdisksusingC relnofollowhttpwww.codeproject.comArticles13530EjectUSBdisksusingCap  pWhich is the only real code result that Google returns, and the only article that I see other people linking too on this site and similar ones, saying Hey, why didnt you try google first. p  pWell, I did, and that code is broken in many ways. I changed the compile target for my project to x86 and made a few of the suggested changes in the comments, and at least it will run without just throwing exceptions now. However, all the drive letters enumerate incorrectly. It will successfully eject my usb key with volume label F if I just run the Eject method on every volume it reports, but when it ejects F it thinks its ejecting the volume C according to the property stored in that device object. p  pA possibly related problem is the fact that it doesnt correctly detect which drives are removable. The IsUsb method returns true for C and D, the two partitions on my laptop SSD, and false for E and F, my daemontools cddrive and the actual usb key.p  pI have spent the past 3 days digging through the code myself and searching the web for fixes other people have reported this problem as well, but if people have figured it out, they havent posted their solutions. Im a nix developer making a temporary foray into this world, and I dont have the expertise to really make this worth much more of my time. p  pI was hoping to fix it and just post the answer, but my time and patience is running out and if I dont figure it out by endofday tomorrow Im just going to shell out to a command line utility with a permissible licence. That would be gross though and I hate admitting defeat. p  pSo, for the good of everybody who comes after me, can somebody please help me fix this code and post it where everyone can find it Id be happy to give more details about what Ive done so far.p

Negative 4103 pI have an application assembled that listens for a UDP packet broadcast on the local network and then gives a notification. The only problem is, when the screen is off and the packet broadcast, nothing happens... I have tried partial wake locks and am trying to integrate a foreground service, but I do not think that is what I need. I want it to work similarly to a text message application or facebooks notifications where at all times it is waiting and listening and then when it gets its info it notifies the user. Any ideasp  pThank you.p

Negative 4103 pWe hosted a site in AWS EC2 of type c4.8xlarge. It is a fairly large system with lot of memory and compute resources. Thousands of users tried to access the system during a 2 hour timeframe this weekend. While it did not crash, it slowed down quite a bit and failed to perform at the expected level. Analyzing the stats showed that limited network bandwidth is the main cause of the slowdown. The CPU usage stayed below 6, but NetworkIn and NetworkOut seem to have peaked at 60MB and 200MB respectively during that timeframe. While Im not an networking expect, some reading online seemed to indicate that all the traffic going through one NIC could be the main cause of limited network bandwidth. Is this true Would hosting the site on a different type of EC2 instance help increase the network bandwidth Here is how the networkIn and networkOut metrics looked like under heavy load.p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comKmLin.png altnetworkIn and networkOut metrics chartp

Negative 4103 pIve used archiving, user defaults, and some Core Data in my apps before, but Im running into a wall re the best method for my current scenario. I have an app that needs to instantiate some objects from a resource file each time before its used. An example of one of the objects could be a MathQuestion object that has the propertiesp  ul liquestionID Int  2341li liquestionText String  What is the square root of li liquestionVariable Float  4li licorrectAnswer a blockclosure that returns a Float  return sqrtvalue.li ul  pIdeally, Id just have something like a spreadsheet with columns for each of these properties and rows for each of the different questions. That way, I would really be able to visualize all the data and make quick changes during development.p  pMy app uses Parse, which is great for visualization and easy editing of values, but for this case, Id rather the resources remained on the device and not the Parse server. Ive been considering Core Data up till this point, but this could be my inexperience with C.D., Im unaware of any way to manually edit the dataand it seems like it may be overkill for what Im looking for anyways. I basically just need a way to upload and parse a CSV Any advice would be welcomep
Negative 4103 pIve made a multithreaded server that connects to a MySQL database and accepts requests from a client. The server should always be listening from client commands but this doesnt happen.

Negative 4103 pIm trying to display a static background image behind a scrolling codeWKInterfaceTablecode, that could contain one or more rows. Im trying to do this by placing the table inside a codeWKInterfaceGroupcode, and setting that groups background image. The issue is that if I set the groups height to Size to fit content, the table will not scroll, and if I set the groups height to Relative to container, the image does not take up the full display if there is only one row.p  pIs there a clever way around this problem What I need is for the image to be the height of the display regardless of whether the number of rows is enough to scroll the table or not.p  pPossiblep

Negative 4103 pI am currently in the process of designing the interface for a game engine that is written in JavaScript and ReactJS.p  pIf a game object has a texture, the source of the texture will show up on the game object. For that to work, a game object needs to have the reference of the texture or more specifically the source of a texture. What Im hoping for is to have a JSX snippet like the following one.p  precodeltGameObjectgt   ltTexture sourcemyimage.png gt ltGameObjectgt codepre  pThe best solution I could come up with to get the reference is to have the texture as a prop, like sop  precodeltGameObject textureltTexture sourcemyimage.png gt gt codepre  pIf the game enginespecific terminology is a bit too bewildering, think of it as a caption component inside a button component, where the caption component has specific data the button needs to access.p  pMy question boils down to this Is it possible to access childrens prop after the children have been mounted without hacks or being an antipatternp

However, after finally getting a report back that the output is not working Im really confused as to why Im getting the error that there were missing variables.

Im able to process basic summary statistic tables, but when I load the macro the output is not working.p  pWhy is the data set not loading  Does a macro require a certain type of data set  p  pNote  A limitation is that I do not have access to the data set, so I must send code to be run and wont get results for a few days.

Negative 4103 pI searched high and low now but I cant figure out how to get this to workp  pstrongI need to get the element whose class name contains a number that I pass with a variable.strong p  pFor better understanding This is inside a click event on a gallery. Whenever an img is clicked I search for the src, see which number the string contains and then want to find the matching p whose class contains the same number. So I can manipulate the matching text to the picture that is currently displayed Since the plugin I use strips away any id or class I can only identifiy a picture by its source name.p  pSo far it does work if I directly put the number in as a String.

Negative 4103 pI have 2 data frames df1 and df2. They share 3 cols in common permno, cusip, and ticker.  Each row of df1 is a unique stock.

Negative 4103 pI am making a website that uses the Javascript Parse SDK and calling codeParse.User.currentcode only works some of the times causing my redirect to kick users back to the login page even though codeParse.User.logOutcode has not been called. I am using the User class and not having them login through Facebook.p  pFunction to see if there is an active session. If there is, the page loads, otherwise the user should be redirected to the main pagep  precodefunction checkUser     var currentUser  Parse.User.current     if currentUser         the page loads      else         redirect user to the login page        window.location  loginurl       codepre  pThe above code is called in the codeltheadgtcode tag of each pagep  pcodeltscriptgtcheckUserltscriptgtcodep  pWhen the user logs in, I check to make sure codeParse.User.currentcode is not null and then redirect them to the main page. The first time they are sent to the main page, the codecheckUsercode function does not find a user, and they are sent back to the login page where my coderedirectcode function below sends them back to the main page because codeParse.User.currentcode is not null when it checks it. The second time they are sent to the main page, codeParse.User.currentcode has a user, so they stay on this page.p  pTo a user logging in, the above is not a problem, since after logging in, they end up on the right page, but the real issue arises when the user tries to navigate to a different page using the tabs codelta hrefnewurlgtnameltagtcode. When one of these is clicked, codecheckUsercode on the new page does not find a user so the user is pushed back to the login page, where coderedirectcode does find a user and sends them back to the main page where codecheckUsercode finds a user as well, so they end up back on the main page again.p  pI do not know what the issue is, but I think it has something to do with initially changing the pages programatically because if I log in and then type the url of a different page into my address bar instead of clicking on a tab, the codecheckUsercode finds a user and then I can use the tabs to switch pages without a problem.

I have a screen where are several buttons on bottom of the screen and then there is one, which is in the middle see screenshot to understand. The problem is that I cant get focused the middle button. Focus is only on bottom three buttons. The problem is obviously caused by the strongY positionstrong, when I move the button on bottom of the screen, it gets focused.p  pButtons are created in storyboard, there is no code in ViewController. Settings in storyboard for the middle button are equal with settings for bottom buttons. Do I have to handle this manually in code Or is it even possible to get focus movement like this I would appreciate any information, thanks.p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comXpk5o.png alt1]p  pIm still developing in simulator.p
Negative 4103 pIm running nginx and php7fpm and have problems with the SoapClient accepting local wsdl files. I use a local file like apibackendserverreservationreservationv012.wsdl but I get a 502 Bad Gateway error. When I use file I get an error failed to load external entity.p  pgetTypes is not delivering any types. The 502 Bad Gateway error occurs exactly at this position, when getTypes is called.p  pAny idea why its not running like it does with PHP 5.3 beforep

Negative 4103 pI know how to start a konsole with one executable running in it, and leave the konsole open after the program ends. I can do this using a .desktop file and change some options in it.p  pBut I would like one step further, to launch a KDE konsole with multiple tabs open, each running a particular program, and that when the program finishes it stays open and give you a prompt.p  pTheres no man page for konsole so I dont even know what options it can take. Or some dbus calls  Thanksp
