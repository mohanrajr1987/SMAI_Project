So using the above program I experiment it. On that program, the address of global variable a is 0x804a014. Each time main is called, the local variable i gets declared. So, I  expect, before the segmentation fault, the address of i is nearly to address of a. But, both the address are very different. So whats here going on. p  pWhy the address of a and i is not in the same range at the time of segmentation fault error.  So, how to cross check whether the main reaches the stack size and gets overflowed p

Positive 61 pFirst I have to mention that I run on a CentOS 7 tuned up to support 1 million connections. I tested with a simple C server and client and I connected 512000 clients. I could have connect more but I did not have enought RAM to spawn more linux client machines, since from a machine I can open 65536 connections 8 machines  64000 connections each  512000.p  pI made a simple Erlang server to which I want to connect 1 million or half a million clients, using the same C client. The problem Im having now is memory related. For each successfully codegentcpacceptcode call I spawn a process. Around 50000 open connections costs me 3.7 GB RAM on server, meanwhile using the C server I could have open 512000 connections using 1.9 GB RAM. It is true that on the C server I did not created a process after accept to handle stuff, I just called accept again in while loop, but even so... guys on web did this erlang thing with less memory  ejabberd riak  p  pI presume that the flags that I pass to the erlang VM should do the trick.

Positive 61 pI am having a problem with assigning new values to a dynamic int array that is a data member variable of the class IntersectionFlowRate. I can initialize and print the values of the array inside the constructor. However, when I exit the constructor to the another class and then later call a function within the IntersectionFlowRate class passing in variables to overwrite the initial values of the data member it will segmentation fault.

Positive 61 pI am performing statistics on 2 rather large 2 GB each 3D arrays and I perform that computation inside a functionp  precodedouble statsvectorlt vectorlt vectorlt double gt gt gt A, vectorlt vectorlt vectorlt double gt gt gt B codepre  pI believe that a large amount of the time taken by the program is simply passing codeAcode and codeBcode to my function, rather than actually performing the statistics eminsideem the function.p  pDoes this seem reasonable Is there substantial overhead from passing these codevectorcodes to a function If so, what is the best way to account for this I know that I could simply put all of these functions inside a codeclasscode and then refer to the arrays in terms of a class member, but I was hoping to keep these functions class agnostic if possible.p
Positive 61 pI have seen that lot of code bases specially server codes have basic sometimes advanced memory managers. Is the real purpose of memory manager is to reduce number of malloc calls or mainly for the purpose of memory analysis, corruption check or may be other application centric purposes. p  pIs the argument of saving malloc calls reasonable enough as malloc in itself is a memory manager. The only performance gain I can reason is when we know that system always ask for same size memory. p  pOr the reason for having memory manager is that free does not return memory to OS but saves in the list. So over the lifetime of the process, the heap usage of the process may increase if we keep on doing mallocfree because of fragmentation.p

Positive 61 pI am debugging my program with immunity debugger when I realized that there were data already written in it before the program replace them by the new datas. My question is  is it normal to see something written in a buffer before putting the new datas in it p

Positive 61 pAlright so Im going to try to explain one problem at a time so you can understand the issues Im having and hopefully someone will be able to tell me hoe to fix it. So my app runs perfectly but my users have been complaining of high ram usage and on average it runs any where from 120mb to 200mb IDLE which I agree isnt right so I went ahead and remembered a trick I used in a previous project and that was this line of code androidhardwareAcceleratedfalse. This removes about 10mb of ram per activity but Im still sitting at about 90mb of usage so i went and looked a little harder and found this androidprocessProcessName which takes my app from using 100mb to a mere 8mb of ram. But Im facing a problem while doing this and that is the fact that I have a LocalBroadcastManager in a service activity that sends data to my MainActivity and when these two have different processes they dont communicate with each other, and if I combine them into the same process the usage spikes yet again. So Im kinda stuck what to do at this point and I refuse to use the Android Memory debugger because it doesnt tell me jack crap about what my code is doing wrong. Quite literally I have 5 text views and an imageview inside of my MainActivity so I know its not that intensive by any means If anyone needs code please let me know but I figured someone really didnt need to look at the code to answer thisp

Negative 61 pProblem with dynamic controlsp  pHello all,p  pIm wanting to create some dynamic controls, and have them persist their viewstate across page loads.  Easy enough, right  All I have to do is recreate the controls upon each page load, using the same IDs.  HOWEVER, heres the catch  in my PreRender event, Im wanting to clear the controls collection, and then recreate the dynamic controls with new values.  The reasons for this are complicated, and it would probably take me about a page or so to explain why I want to do it.  So, in the interests of brevity, lets just assume that I absolutely must do this, and that theres no other way.p  pThe problem comes in after I recreate the controls in my PreRender event.  The recreated controls never bind to the viewstate, and their values do not persist across page loads.  I dont understand why this happens.  Im already recreating the controls in my OnLoad event.  When I do this, the newly created controls bind to the ViewState just fine, provided that I use the same IDs every time.  However, when I try to do the same thing in the PreRender event, it fails.p  pIn any case, here is my example code  p  pnamespace TestFramework.WebControls p  precodepublic class ValueLinkButton  LinkButton      public string Value              get                      return stringViewState[ID  vlbValue]                   set                      ViewState[ID  vlbValue]  value                 public class TestControl  WebControl      protected override void OnLoadEventArgs e              base.OnLoade          Controls.Clear          ValueLinkButton tempLink  null          tempLink  new ValueLinkButton         tempLink.ID  valueLinkButton         tempLink.Click  new EventHandlerValueClick          if Page.IsPostBack                      tempLink.Value  old value                   Controls.AddtempLink           protected override void OnPreRenderEventArgs e              base.OnPreRendere          ValueLinkButton tempLink  ValueLinkButtonFindControlvalueLinkButton  [CASE 1]          ValueLinkButton tempLink  new ValueLinkButton  [CASE 2]          tempLink.ID  valueLinkButton         tempLink.Value  new value         tempLink.Text  Click                      Controls.Clear         Controls.AddtempLink           void ValueClickobject sender, EventArgs e              Page.Response.Write[  ValueLinkButtonsender.Value  ]       codepre  pp  pSo, lets examine case 1, where the line next to [CASE 1] is not commented out, but the line next to [CASE 2] is commented out.  Here, everything works just fine.  When I put this control on a page and load the page, I see a link that says Click.  When I click the link, the page outputs the text [new value], and on the next line, we see the familiar Click link.  Every subesquent time I click on the Click link, we see the same thing.  So far, so good.p  pBut now lets examine case 2, where the line next to [CASE 1] is commented out, but the line next to [CASE 2] is not commented out.  Here we run into problems.  When we load the page, we see the Click link.  However, when I click on the link, the page outputs the text [] instead of [new value].  The click event is firing normally.  However, the new value text that I assigned to the Value attribute of the control does not get persisted.  Once again, this is a bit of a mystery to me.  How come, when I recreate the control in OnLoad, everythings fine and dandy, but when I recreate the control in PreRender, the value doesnt get persistedp  pI feel like there simply has to be a way to do this.  When I recreate the control in PreRender, is there some way to bind the newly created control to the ViewStatep  pIve struggled with this for days.  Any help that you can give me will be appreciated.p  pThanks.p

Negative 61 pIve been having a look at several MVC frameworks like rails, merb, cakephp, codeignitier, and similars...p  pAll the samples Ive seen are basically plain and simple CRUD pages, carrying all the infr needed in the querystring and the posted field values.p  pIve got a couple of apps made with some sort of framework built with classic asp.p  pThis framework handles some CRUD stuff a little more complex than the examples I found.p  pSomething like masterdetail, filtering by example, paging, sorting and similars.p  pI have a controller class that its just a finite state machine, that goes thru diferent states like new, browse, filter, show, etc., then performs the appropiate action depending on the event raised and finally retrieves the neede info to the calling page.p  pTo achieve this I have several hidden inputs to keep the state of the web page like current id, filter criterias, order criterias, previous state, previous event, well, you get the ideap  pWhat do you think would be the finnest approach to achieve this kind of funcionalityp  phidden inputs built in the view and used from the controller I guess that would be the equivalent of what Im doing right now in classi aspp  pp  padded in response to tvanfossonp  pbasically, my question refers to the third category, the contextdependent setting in respect to the other two categories I agree with you the info I was storing in hidden fields to store them on the querystring, I guess that when you click on the next page you include everything you need to save in the querystring, right so that piece of query string gets appended in each and every link that performns some kind of action...p  pIm not sure, what are the advantages and disadvantages of using the querystring instead of hidden inputsp

Negative 61 pIm working on a little Java game in which all sorts of events can happen.  There are at least a couple of dozen basic events that various event handlers may be interested in.  There are also several places in the code where these events might be triggered.  Rather than forcing the event listeners to know which class they need to register with, Id like to create some sort of a centralized messagedispatching system, which some classes would submit events into and interested classes could hook into to listen for certain kinds of events.p  pBut I have some questions.  Firstly, this seems like an obvious and common problem.  Are there favorite implementations of simple, inVM messaging systems  Seems like there would be.p  pSecondly, and more importantly, Im trying to work out a reasonably elegant way for the dispatching class to know as little as possible about types of messages.  Id love to be able to create new kinds of events without modifying the message dispatcher at all.  However, I have an opposite concern.  Id really like for the method signatures of the handling methods to be clear.  In other words, I would prefer the followingp  precodepublic class CollisionConsoleHandler implements CollisionListener    Override   public void spaceshipCollidedWithMeteor Spaceship spaceship, Meteor meteor         ...     codepre  pover something more generic and harder to readp  precodepublic class CollisionConsoleHandler implements GameMessageListener     Override    public void handleMessage GameMessage message        if message instanceof SpaceshipCollisionMessage           Spaceship spaceship  SpaeshipCollisionMessagemessage.getSpaceship         Meteor meteor  SpaeshipCollisionMessagemessage.getMeteor         ...            codepre  pBut I dont see any good ways to keep typespecific knowledge out of the dispatcher while at the same time keeping the method signatures clean and readable.p  pIdeasp

I looked up examples on the web, and I do not see any differences in code as to why mine will not work.p  pThe HTML for the section of the site is as follows  p  precodelt START NAVIGATION amp SUB NAVIGATION gt ltdiv classnavgt     ltulgt     ltligtlta classnavhome hrefgtltspangthomeltspangtltagtltligt     ltligtlta classnavabout hrefgtltspangtaboutltspangtltagtltligt     ltligtltagtltspangtresearchltspangtltagtltligt     ltligtltagtltspangtfindingsltspangtltagtltligt     ltligtltagtltspangtcontactltspangtltagtltligt     ltulgt ltdivgt ltdiv classsubnavgt     ltul classsubnavhomegt     ltligtltagtltspangtsub linkltspangtltagtltligt     ltligtltagtltspangtsub linkltspangtltagtltligt     ltligtltagtltspangtsub linkltspangtltagtltligt     ltligtltagtltspangtsub linkltspangtltagtltligt     ltligtltagtltspangtsub linkltspangtltagtltligt     ltligtltagtltspangtsub linkltspangtltagtltligt     ltligtltagtltspangtsub linkltspangtltagtltligt     ltulgt     ltul classsubnavaboutgt     ltligtltagtltspangtsub linkltspangtltagtltligt     ltligtltagtltspangtsub linkltspangtltagtltligt     ltligtltagtltspangtsub linkltspangtltagtltligt     ltligtltagtltspangtsub linkltspangtltagtltligt     ltligtltagtltspangtsub linkltspangtltagtltligt     ltligtltagtltspangtsub linkltspangtltagtltligt     ltulgt ltdivgt lt FINISH NAVIGATION gt codepre  pNote this is just testing information to make sure I can get the navigation working before implementing the real thing.

Then I have a listener for two of the nav links that should call codegetsubnavigationcode. That function will check if there is one showing just used 0 for defaultnothing and if there is hide it and if not, then show one.p  pAs you can see, it is not finished code but, I dont want move any further until I can get this figured out. p  pAny help is much appreciatedp

Negative 61 pIn my iPhone app I was using integers to keep track of a lot of variables.  I declared and initialized them all in my AppDelegate file its a multiview app, and then if I declared them in the other views classes and the values would stay the same.

Negative 61 pI have tried the simple test Silverlight 2.0 animation test at a hrefhttpbubblemark.com relnofollowhttpbubblemark.coma, surprisingly Moonlight provided only 26 fps on Linux. WindowsSilverlight 3 gave me 192 fps on the exact same machine. Why is Moonlight so much slower than Silverlightp  pThis performance gap is really important if you are planning to develop high fps, multi platform apps in Silverlight, since the current speed of Moonlight can be a limiting factor.p  pPlease dont answer if the only things you have to say are trivialities like moonlight is a reimplementation, it must be slower, or it lags behind the official version. p  pI am interested in some kind of an authourative answer, especially from someone familiar with the code and current state of Moonlight.p  pThanksp

Negative 61 pI am thinking that if a class will be instantiated only in another class so it is right to use it nested in that class.I think this will help us good design.When i look at my project i have almost never seen such nested structure.But if i try to nested classes so this time another questions appear in my mind.For examplep  pI have Board class, Move classes such as ShortCastle,LongCastle,EnPassant,Promote and Pieces like Pawn,Queen,Rook,Knight etc. So it is clear Board classes will instantiate Piece classes and Piece classes will instantiate Move classes. For a good design,Promote move  class should to be nested of Pawn because only pawn can promote itself.short and long Castles should to be nested of King because only king can have such type moves.p  pTrying to put all Piece classes into Board class is not looking good design because 89 class will be inside of Board class and it will really annoying one Board class file will be too large and hardly readable.I prefer keep each piece class in another file. Good that we can create partial Board class but still isnt it annoying 89 Partial Board class files will hold each piece class Is it better to not make them nested  Same about Pieces Create another partial Piece file just for another Move type class  If nested class just take small space so it wouldnt be any problem but if it takes many methods p

Negative 61 pI recently created a couple inline tablevalued UDFs and then referenced them in a couple views using Cross Apply in one case and Outer Apply in another case. After I got it working and tested, I thought it was a pretty cool use of UDFs and CrossOuter Applys. But then it occurred to me that I probably could have done the same thing using a view.p  pSo, my question is this. For those of you who have done this sort of thing, how do you decide to use an ITV UDF vs. a View I realize of course that the UDF can take parameters whereas a view cannot, but those UDF parameter values could be used in a Where clause when querying against the View.p  pThanks.p

Accordion TemplateStaticResource ajaxTemplategt           ltlayoutToolkitAccordionItem.Contentgt           ltTextBlockgt             The Accordion is a control that allows you to provide multiple panes and display them.ltLineBreakgt             There are several selection modes, so you can decide if only one pane can be open, ltLineBreakgt             or multiple.ltLineBreakgt             It is also possible to adjust the order in which the panes open and closeltLineBreakgt             Simultaneous or close first. ltLineBreakgt             ltLineBreakgt             The Accordion is implemented as an itemscontrol that contains AccordionItem controls. ltLineBreakgt             Each AccordionItem control has a template for its Header and its Content. ltLineBreakgt           ltTextBlockgt         ltlayoutToolkitAccordionItem.Contentgt       ltlayoutToolkitAccordionItemgt       ltlayoutToolkitAccordionItem Header2.

If more than one pane ltLineBreakgt           may be opened, space is divided equally among them.           ltLineBreakgt           Whether you fill to height or width is determined by the ExpandDirection property.ltLineBreakgt           An accordion will is able to expand to Down, Up, Left and Right directions.         ltTextBlockgt       ltlayoutToolkitAccordionItemgt       ltlayoutToolkitAccordionItem Header3.

This caused me a lot of pain. But I wanted to use the Repository pattern in a very generic way, a way which didnt care if the object was already attached or had been freshly created as the result of ASP.NET MVC binding. So I needed an codeUpdateUsercode method, and Ive attached it below.p  precode    public User UpdateUserUser user          if context.Entryuser.State  EntityState.Detached              context.Users.Attachuser             context.Entryuser.State  EntityState.Modified                  return user      codepre  pThe method obviously assumes that the object exists in the data store in some fashion, its called codeUpdateUsercode after all. If the object is already attached, you will benefit from the objects previous state, which in turn will allow for an optimised update to the DB. However, if the object was not attached, the method forces the whole thing to become dirty.p  pSeems obvious now, wasnt before. Hope it helps someone.p  pRichp

Negative 61 pOK. Im having a ridiculous problem. Im trying to use URL rewrite to redirection from www.domain.com to www.domain.comdefault.aspx.p  pI thought by setting default.aspx as the default document it would automatically drop the user there. But for some reason it still comes up www.domain.com.p  pThe reason I want it to go to www.domain.comdefault.aspx is that the login control on the page doesnt seem to want to work when it is just the www.domain.com. But of course if I type in the www.domain.comdefault.aspx then the login works fine. The login control doesnt seem to post at all if it is www.domain.com. Anyway, Im trying to avoid troubleshooting why the login control is not firing and just force it to land on default.aspx anytime someone tries to go to www.domain.com. Im using IIS7. Any ideas herep

Negative 61 pIve written a small library for creating servicesdaemons in Java. The idea is simple. When you start your application you pass a command and a port number. If the command is a start command, a new instance of your application will be started on the specified port. Otherwise, the command will be sent to any instance that might be running on that port.p  pIn short, the library provides a daemonize method that starts a daemon controller thread. It uses sockets to make your application communicate with instances of itself as youve probably already figured out.p  pFor clarity, heres an example of how you would use itp  precodepublic class MyApp extends Daemon      public static void mainString[] args              if daemonizeMyApp.class, args                       normal main body             startMyServerOrWhatever                  else                       failed to start or send command to daemon              probably wrong syntax or unknown command             printUsageInfoAndExit                    Commandstart  true     public static int start               executed on start command, e.g. java jar MyApp.jar start 8899         doSomeInitializing         return 0  return 0 or void to detach from console           Command     public static void mycmd               executed on mycmd command, i.e. java jar MyApp.jar mycmd 8899         doSomethingCool           Commandstop  true     public static int stop               executed on stop command, i.e. java jar MyApp.jar stop 8899         doSomeCleanup         return 0  used as application exit code       codepre  pThe library works really well and Ive used it to create a couple of daemons that will run on a Linux server. Whats missing now is some scripts to let the admins control these daemons like they control other daemons on the server e.g. start at boot.p  pUnfortunately my nix skills, especially when it comes to scripting, are not top level. I have a basic understanding of the BSDstyle init procedure rc.d, but looking at sample scripts like a hrefhttpwww.sourcecode.bizsnippetsjavajavaDaemonTest.sh.txt relnofollowthis onea I feel a little lost.p  pSo my question is, strongisnt there a simpler way to do thisstrong in my case I mean, my daemons already understand the commands and should themselves be responsible for any actions except in the case where a daemon doesnt respond to stop  it should then be killed after some timeout.p
Negative 61 pI like the using statement for its control of scope and for readability. Not only can you create objects, use them and dispose them neatly, but you can also use it like thisp  pSuppose myInstance is an instance of MyClass from some other place in code  ie a method parameter or somethingp  precodeusing var t  myInstance      t.Foo Hello     t.Bar World     ...  codepre  pDefinition of MyClassp  precodepublic class MyClass  IDisposable     public string Foo get set    public string Bar get set    ...     public void Dispose   codepre  pThis makes code neater and more readable I feel and certainly easier to type. However in order to use this widely you have to implement IDisposable. In this case theres no need for MyClass actually handle anything in Dispose, so its empty.p  pstrongMy question is, is there any drawback to using IDisposable in this waystrongp  pI appreciate that there are similar questions already on SO, but I dont think these deal with using IDispose for this purpose or they refer to specific classes.p  pstrongEDITstrongp  pOK, so I guess I was being a bit specifc, but theres a wider point here. The using statement is a handy, very neat way to define an instance for a specific length of time, and then you can forget about it. Its seems unfair that this ability should be restricted to IDisposable objects only.  Yes theres a certain amount of laziness in not just instancing and then setting to null, but the using block makes it very specific what the instances scope is. strongWhy shouldnt I be allowed to do it with non IDisposable classesstrongp

Negative 61 pIm fairly new to Python and was hoping I could get some advice before moving forward. I  have a group of integers and I want to check whether or not a given element is contained within that group as fast as possible speed does matter here.p  pWith Python, should I be looking at custom data structures tailored for these operations BST, etc, python trickery like wrapping with any, or are there any well known PythonC libraries that are standard for this sort of thing. I dont want to reinvent the wheel here, so Im interested to hear the common way to approach this in Python.p  pA little more background, elements are all inserted into the group up front, and none occur thereafter, so insertion time doesnt matter. This seems to imply that maintaining a sorted group and doing something like binary search will be the best approach, but Im sure this has already been implemented much more efficiently than I could implement and is available in a PythonC lib.

Negative 61 pI recently switched to R, and I love it.

Ive tried and tried to figure out how to do it in R, but one of the big pitfalls of using a language named R for which there is also a statistic R and searching for terms like Adjust are that I can only seem to find hits on adjusted R squared. Its beyond frustrating.p  pSo, at the risk of asking a really easy question, does anyone know how to do this Ive looked into predictive margins, and that seems like at least a related type of method, but its implementation usually involves standardizing the explanatory variables in some way. p

Negative 61 pSo Ive got a website that serves 1000 users, coordinating scheduling for events. Id like to enable our system to send SMS messages to users.

Negative 61 pQ1 What is the reason for the enormass bloating of FLA file size, when many edits and saves are made to a FLA file, yet assets are not being added to the library p  pQ2 What is the best technique to keep FLA files smaller in size with the problem described below. I am not talking about published SWF files or asset managementp  pOver many edits and many saves of my FLA files, they become 30 times the size on disk from where they start out. Example 750k can get as high as 34mb. In the past strongsave and compactstrong used to fill the role of reducing FLA file sizes but now that feature is gone. p  pThe issue is discussed here but does not provide a satisfactory solution or reason a hrefhttpwww.xllusion.neted20100504nosaveandcompactonflashcs5 relnofollowhttpwww.xllusion.neted20100504nosaveandcompactonflashcs5ap  pExtra Detailsp  pWhen I save as a CS4 file then back to CS5 the file becomes much smaller after it has become bloated, BUT I take a risk every time I do this that the file will become corrupted Ive had corruptions happen. p  pI have read that files which were created in CS5 and are never in the format of CS4 dont have this problem, but I find that theory unlikely since I have tried to follow this rule to no success.p  pI have also read that every FLA file tracks its history of assets. So adding and removing assets to the library will sometimes cause bloating because old assets that are removed from the library remain in the FLA file. This seems bogus because there is no purpose to this, but could be an indication of a bug in Adobe Flash Professional CS5, and CS5.5.p  pPersonal details the files I am editing contain personally created flash components, images, audio, many symbols 20 but no embedded video.p  pFor me personally, this bloating is a problem because Im dealing with hundreds of flash FLA files that should be about 14mb in size but are instead much larger. The overall effect is that I end up with gigabytes of files instead of hundreds of mbs. p  pThanks so much for your helpp

Negative 61 pIm no Java expert but the program Im making is going to be dealing with high throughput.  So I thought Id do a little crowd sourcing for opinions.  Heres the situation.p  pA java process will be watching a directory for files to process, these files will be paired data file to be stored and xml file with meta information to be cataloged.  So I need to get the list of current files, check for the required twins, and then process.p  pFiles will always have matching filenames and only differ by file extension e.g. filename1.jpg filename1.xml filename2.jpg filename2.xmlp  pI have three options Ive thought of so far.p  ol lipUse FilenameFilter with File.ListFileNamefilter call to check if the total files with a filename is greater than 1.pli lipUse two filenamefilters to generate a list of files with .xml and without .xml, convert the non XML file list to an ArrayList and call Collections.binarySearch.pli lipGenerate a list of all files without .xml extension, use this list as the keys for a hashmap of keyvalue pairs that assumes the .xml file based on the filename.  Then run through the hash list and check for the existence of the .xml twin before processing.pli ol  pAny thoughtsp  pEDITSCOMMENTSp  pAfter looking at the suggestions and tinkering Im for now going with using two FilenameFilters, one that lists XML files and one that does not.  The list of XML files is stripped of the xml extension and dumped into a hash.  Then the list of data files is iterated through, calling hashlist.contains to see if a match exists in the hashset before proceeding.p  pThere is the concern as mentioned below of processing incomplete files.  As I said in comments, I assume that a newly written file is not visible to nonwriting processes until that write is complete new files, not open for editp

Negative 61 pI have a django application in heroku and one thing I need to do sometimes that take a little bit of time is sending emails. p  pThis is a typical use case of using workers. Heroku offers support for workers, but I have to leave them running all the time or start and stop them manually, which is annoying. p  pI would like to use a oneoff process to send every email. One possibility I first thought of was using IronWorker, since I thought that I could simply add the job to ironworkers queue and it would be exectuted with a mex of 15 min delay, which is ok for me. p  pThe problem is that with ironworker, I need to put in a zip file all the modules and their dependencies in order to run the job, so in my email use case, as I use EmailMultiAlternatives from django.core.mail.message, I would need to include all the django framework in my zip file in order to be able to use it. p  pAccording to a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions3039639canaherokuappaddremovedynosorworkerstofromitselfthis linka, its possible to addremove workers from the app. Is it possible to start oneoff processes from the appp  pDoes anyone has a better solutionp  pThanks in advancep

Negative 61 pWe want to prevent infinite loops in java plugins as well as put limits on number of statements executed.  We have looked at many Java profiling tools and are not seeing any clear way to track this as the Java class is running as opposed to just getting some stats after it completes.p  pI should add that we are aware of jProfiler and this is not an option because we need to track potentially thousands of separate classes with minimal overhead and we need to do this all in code so we can kill a particular executing class should it exceed preset limits.p  pThanksp

Negative 61 pI need to see if a modifier key is pressedshift,ctrl,alt for my mouse eventbasically ctrlclickp  pI was wondering if there is a simple function to check if a key is pressed without implementing a keylistner or action events so as to not have the hassle of keeping track of where the focus is or where the variables are.p
Negative 61 pI have a page with many checkboxes, each of which are tied to a product with a price. Im trying to use jQuery to give a realtime readout of the 1 number of products, and 2 total price of the users selections.p  pThis emshouldem be very easy I would have done something likep  precodeinput.change function     var sum  inputchecked.length     var pricetotal  inputchecked.length  1.99  codepre  h3The Complicationh3  pThe element or elements embeingem changed are NOT counted in the above code. It seems that when clicking a blank checkbox to check it, jQuery will consider the current element not checked rather than checked, i.e. it reflects the checkbox embeforeem the change. As a result, my code gets significantly more complicated to accept the changed items.p  pIs there an elegant and simple way to get around thisp

Negative 61 pIn Scala, is it bad, from the point of view of efficacy and speed of incremental compilers sbt, sbt in Eclipse, IntelliJ, to use wildcard imports Does it adversely affect the way these incremental compilers decide what to recompile in case of changesp  pFor instance, if for a new class codeXcode, I would only need to import classes codeAcode and codeBcode and not codeCcode from package codepackcode, do I get a penalty for writing thisp  precodeimport pack. codepre  pinstead of thisp  precodeimport pack. A, B  codepre  pAssuming codeAcode and codeBcode have no dependency on codeCcode, would codeXcode be recompiled with the wildcard import and not with the more specific import when codeCcode changes, or would the dependency tracking system be smart enough to realize that codeCcode is not used by codeXcode despite the wildcard importp

Negative 61 pIs it possible to create a trigger that will check if a specific field is being set to NULL from a singleline or multiline update, and if it is, to revert that field back to its initial valuep  pIve searched on the site but not found anything that matches my exact requirements.p  pA bit of backgroundp  pWe have two applications a time management web app and microsoft project server sending updates to each other about the resources in our organisation. When a change is made in either system, it sends that update to the other system. However, there are certain fields that only exist in the time management web app table name coderesourcecode, and MSP server is forcing one of these fields field name codeGLMaskingValuecode to codeNULLcode with some of its updates not all, as far as I can tell. p  pI have no access to the code, just the web app database, and I dont want to make the whole update statement fail which I gather I could do using table constraints  I just want to revert this one field back when and if someone tries to change it to codeNULLcode.p  pIm going down the route of triggers but there may well be a much better way of doing this  if so please enlighten mep

Negative 61 pI have never worked with portals before. So I am confused now. We have an application which is working with Spring and tomcat 5.5. So now they are telling me to use JBoss portal on top of that. My question is that is it possible to link my application which is already done with jsp, spring, etc to the JBoss portal. When I want to install JBoss portal as options it has JBoss7 and tomcat 6 options. This wouldnt interfere with my own app which has to run on tomcat 5.5. Am I rightp  pThanks.p

Negative 61 pI need to create listview which should displays as a photo slider. I mean that it have to be only one item at the screen. And when user starts swiping up or down item above or below become be visible, but doesnt fill the screen. And when user swipes it at some defined point, this item fulfills the screen. And so forth. p  pAs a photo slider. You open it and see only one photo at the screen. Then you click on the photo and start swipe down. Accordingly to your swiping photo which is in bottom of current fulfills the screen. I want to implement such a principle at my listview items. p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comc6tGk.jpg altenter image description here img srchttpi.stack.imgur.comW83wC.jpg altenter image description here img srchttpi.stack.imgur.comq7wHj.jpg altenter image description herep  pI attached the files which can describe what I want to implement. So position 1  start position of the listview. Then user touches the screen and start to swipe left. You can see that on the 2nd picture  user sees the item 1 yet, but also see 2nd item. And, finally, when he swipe over 2nd item to the end, he sees only it on the screen. Im sorry for such strange explanation, but I think that it can make my question more clearly. Besides, I want to implement vertical swiping, not horizontal at my listview and it should be only one item on it.p

Negative 61 pI am dealing with a file in Java that is used to hold serialized objects.  In order to determine if the process that is writing to this file has timed out, I check the lastModified method on the file and expect it to be updated each time an object is written.  On Linux and Mac this works fine, but on Windows, the timestamp is not updated until the FileOutputStream is closed.  Ive also tried directly updating the timestamp using setLastModified to no avail. From what Ive gleaned from Google, it seems that this is known behavior with files on Windows.p  pMy question is how can I achieve what I want on Windows  I just need to be able to determine when something was serialized.  The rub is that the serialization and the monitoring are in different JVMs.  p  pId prefer to find a way to keep using the timestamp approach as it works great on all other platforms, but workarounds would also be appreciated.p  pThanksp

Negative 61 pCurrently, the only way to change the volume of a call is to use the volume buttons on the side of the phone. I find it annoying to have to fiddle around with those buttons when Im on  a call. Im trying make something that lets you set an individual callers voice volume ahead of time. I tried adding some buttons in IB that access the music players volume property, but that only affected the music volume level. Now, Ive implemented an MPVolumeView, but that also seems to only control the music volume. I was under the impression that there was thing called system volume, which includes call volume, that an MPVolumeView could let you manipulate. But apparently its just for the music volume. Is there any way to access and control call volume programaticallyperhaps with MPVolumeView p

Negative 61 pIn CRM 2011, notes get automatically created and attached to main record on lost focus event. Requirement is to remove this auto save functionality. Only till main form is open user should be able to edit notes. And newly added notes should only get saved once main form is saved. For example, if user add one note and closes the browser or do not save the main form, then that note should not get attached to main record, new note should get discarded.p  pI was thinking following solutionp  ol lipcreate new custom entity TempNotesHolderpli lipCreate 1N relationship with the entity where we want this functionality, for example Case entitypli lipMake actual cases note section read onlyit is requirement, user dont want to editdelete functionality for notes once note get createdpli lipWrite plugin for create event of Case and create one Record for TempNotesHolder and associate it with caseRegardingId field in TempNotesHolder  incidentId This will ensure one Case will always have only one associated TempNotesHolder record. There is no way in CRM 2011 to ensure One entity record will have only one record in associated entity i.e. 11 relationship. At least I dont know the way. Let me know if any one are aware about it.pli lipOn Case form, add one IFrame below Cases note sectionpli lipon case form load event, get TempNotesHolderId associated with case using fetchXml.There is no actual field in Case entity that refer to associated TempNotesHolder, hence need to use fetchXml. Some how we can add associated TempNotesHolderId to Case entity, and place that field on Case form, make it hidden, to avoid fetchXmlpli lipPrepare url to display only notes of TempNotesHolder record.controlsnotesnotesdata.aspxEnableInlineEditfalseampEnableInserttrueampidampParentEntitypli lipSet this url to newly added IFrame, so notes of associated TempNotesHolder get displayed in IFrame. It will also have link Add New Note.pli lipUser can add note to TempNotesHolder which are not directly added to Case record.pli lipNext develop plugin on pre save event of Case and check if there are any notes added to TempNoteHolder, if yes move those notes to Case record, and delete notes for TempNoteHolderId. This way notes will get saved to main record only on main form save.pli lipTo handle browser close event after adding few notes to TempNotesHolder, write plugin on Case pre Retrieve event, check if any notes present for associated TempNotesHolderId, if present then delete those notes. As notes are present on TempNotesHolderId, that means due to some reason these notes are not moved to actual case record and we no longer need them, so delete them. This will ensure on case load, TempNotesHolder note section always be blankpli ol  pThe above solution was fine till step 8. When I tried to add notes in TempNotesHolder, it gave me error, Record with  does not exists in TempNotesHolder. Then I checked that GUID, I disappointed to know CRM is taking IncidentId when I create note for TempNotesHolder. Then I tracked down the actual code for create notes to find why it is taking IncidentId instead of TempNotesHolderId. I found following code in staticcontrolsnotesnotes.htc function name UpdateNotep  pxml0CrmEncodeDecode.CrmXmlEncodevalueparentCrmFormSubmit.crmFormSubmitId.valuethis.parentEntityTypeCrmEncodeDecode.CrmXmlEncodecurrentTitlethis.userIdp  pCRM is taking parentCrmFormSubmit.crmFormSubmitId.value as objectid while creating note.p  pNow I stuck with this problem.

Ill read all your suggestions and will select a balance between productivity and speed. I admit it I am a performace addict thats the reason of my interest on this.

Negative 61 pMy problem is this, we have a set of legacy code that runs SiteMinder but very poorly.  It allows Anonymous at IIS and avoids any use of Active Directory.  p  pWe are rebuilding this application and would like to integrate SiteMinder with IIS and .NET 4.0.  I know that I can come in and build my own security framework that does everything without the need of a User Name and Password because we dont want that from SiteMinder, but I was wondering if there is a way to use the built in Windows Authentication Forms or Windows to integrate with SiteMinder.  p  pAdditionally I saw that older versions of .NET had Passport Authentication, but it has been removed.  I think this might actually solve our problem but it isnt supported in the most recent versions of .NET I.E. beyond 1.1.  p  pAny and all information regarding SiteMinder integration with ASP.NET 4.0 would be more than welcome.  Ive tried to stitch together enough information to get it working.  p  pI know that SiteMinder returns a set of customizable headers.  I want to use the fact that we have a verified Header that contains a Unique Identifier to log a user in, while at the same time using Windows Authentication.  Any guidance would be appreciated.  Id really like it if we could create a guide to integrating SiteMinder and ASP.NET because I havent found one but if anyone knows of something like that please post it upp

Negative 61 pIve been working on this for a week now and I just cant figure it out. I have a Pager Adapter with 4 views. It lets me swipe between them.

destroyItem is what I think is causing it, because when I remove it the app doesnt crash until I start swiping threw views.p  precodepublic class SplashPager extends PagerAdapter   Button b  Override

Negative 61 pI have an issue with Fancybox2, there is a very slight transparency during the transition from one gallery image to another. You can see a rough example of it on their site the Image Gallery examples, second row a hrefhttpfancyapps.comfancyboxexamples relnofollowhttpfancyapps.comfancyboxexamplesa  When the image transitions to the next one, you can see the background during a very short time.p  pNow otherwise this wouldnt be a big issue, but on one of my websites there are 2 images that are very similar, and they have a slow fade transitioneffect so that it would seem like they are kind of morphing back and forth. Here the problem is very pronounced because you can see all the website text behind the images when the transition happens. Ive tried changing various things in the fancybox .css and .js but none of it seems to help. p  pI also tried using the older Fancybox 1.x , which doesnt have the problem, but it also doesnt have crossfading so the image fades out completely before the next image starts to fade in.

Negative 61 pBasically, what I want to do here is read in a specific range of data Say, 10,000 values and see if it contains a match that Im looking for. If it doesnt contain that match, then it throws out those values and takes the next 10,000.p  pFor example, if I have the MD5 hash fac2a47adace059aff113283a03f6760 The value of which is stack, I will load 10,000 values from a CSV file and check to see if the MD5 hash in that line matches up with my given hash. If it does, then I print out the value after the comma on that line, and if it doesnt then throw those 10,000 values out of memory and take the 10,000 after that until I get a value.p  pApologies of this is a bit unclear... I cant think of a crystalclear way of explaining it. My current method of doing things is dumping a dictionary containing all the combinations of characters up to 5 to a text file via JSON and loading that back into memory to be searched, which doesnt work with 5 characters Throws a MemoryError.p  pThanks in advance for any help, and let me know if you need clarificationp

Negative 61 pIm trying to create a Shiny application, and I need the messages that the client sends to the server and the answers the server sends back especially the images.

We would like to save the  whole html, or just the image. with the current state of the menus as a string. I tried to save the html, but it did not contain the image. That is why I would like t those messages, because I guess they contain the data I need.p  pHowever, I chose Java, because these states should be saved to a graph showing stepbystep how the final form gained shape.

Negative 61 pI am using codeASP.NET MVC 4code and the latest version of codeFluent Validationcode. I am using Fluent Validation over data annotations.p  pI am looking at adding a validation error summary to my view where data is to be entered.  I currently just use the codeValidationMessageForcode with each input field.  Sometimes I need to do other validation like against a service after the form validation is true, and then have these messages displayed on the view if the validation failed.  And because this validation is not related to any input field I want to have this error displayed in a validation error summary.p  pLets take for example my employee number field, it is required and it cannot be longer than 10 characters.

If the textbox is empty then it displays the Required error message next to the textbox, and if it is more than 10 characters then it displays the Must not be greater than 10 characters error message.p  pNow I want to add my validation error summary to the view.  I added the followingp  precodeHtml.ValidationSummarytrue, Errors have occurred while. Fix the errors before saving. codepre  pI would like it to display some decent error message relating to the control above.  Although it displays Required next to the employee number if it is empty, I would like it to display something like Employee number is required in the validation error summary.  Currently it just displays the text Errors have occurred while. Fix the errors before saving..p  pAnd when I need to do other validation after form validation is true, like check if the employee is a valid employee, then I also want this error message to be displayed. If I have this in my controllers action methodp  precodeModelState.AddModelError, My test error message codepre  pI would like to have My test error message to be displayed in the validation error summary.p  pHow would something like this be possiblep

But if we want to prevent this we would have to declare more methods in the ReportGenerator class to forward the call to the Configuration object, and use defensive copy.p  pSo my question is that if you have a object A which contains another object B using composition and they both have getter and setter, do you prefer to change object Bs state via As getter method E.g.p  precodeA.getB.setTitle codepre  por do you prefer to add method to A to change Bs state basically forwarding call to Bp  pE.g.p  precodeA.setBTitle codepre  pand internally in this method, A call B.setTitlep  pSorry about the long question, I think I am not really sure what exactly I want to ask. Hope you can understand. Pp

Negative 61 pDoes anyone know of a way that I can gat data from 2 tables in a MySql DB using PHP My android app allows users to place items in a shopping carttable in MySql. When the user clicks on the shopping cart button on in the app it loads the Shopping Cart Activity and loads a listview with everything they have added to their cart based on a Session ID or Customer ID if they are logged in. What I do right now is when the item is added to the cart I capture the Product ID, Product Name, and Image URL, Quantity, and Price. It works great and quickly. What I am wanting to do is since the Product Name, image url, and price are already in the Products Table I want to do the same thing but when the user adds an item to their cart only capture the Product ID and session ID. When the customer goes to the Shopping Cart Activity I want my PHP Script to grab the Product ID in the ShoppingCart table then Search the Procucts Tables for that Product ID and return the Price, Image URL, Name, etc.p  pHere is my PHP Scriptp  precodeifTheFunctionLOADCART     response  array      requireonce DIR . dbconnect.php      con  new DBCONNECT      usersession  GET[session]     useritemstatus  GET[status]     ordertotal  0.00     result  mysqlquerySELECT  FROM shoppingcart WHERE SessionID LIKE usersession AND Status LIKE useritemstatus      ifemptyresult         if mysqlnumrowsresult gt 0              response[cartcontents]  array             result  mysqlfetcharrayresult             while row  mysqlfetcharrayresult                  myItems  array                  myItems[productid]  row[PID]                 myItems[productname]  row[Item]                 myItems[productprice]  row[Price]                 myItems[productqty]  row[Qty]                 myItems[imageurl]  row[URL]                 myItems[lineid]  row[ItemCount]                 linetotal  row[Price]  row[Qty]                 ordertotal  ordertotal  linetotal                 arraypushresponse[cartcontents], myItems                           success             response[success]  1             response[ordertotal]  ordertotal              user node               response[products]  array              echoing JSON response             echo jsonencoderesponse          else               no product found             response[success]  0             response[message]  No product found               echo no users JSON             echo jsonencoderesponse               else           no product found         response[success]  0         response[message]  No product found           echo no users JSON         echo jsonencoderesponse       codepre  pHere is what I am trying to do.

Is there a keyboard shortcut for it to take me to the layout file. I know if you click on it with kbdCTRLkbd it gives you this option on a popup, but I hate using the mouse. I cant find this on the keybinding section. Theres just plain open declaration which I have already changed because it was a horrible kbdF3kbd by default, but this usually takes you to the R filep

Negative 61 pWhat I am trying to do is to place a class object in the buffer and then be able to reference it correctly later.Essentially its a container class using a buffer for data storage.The best way I thought of doing so was storing the objects address in the buffer, reference it by its index, and then cast it.

Negative 61 pThis is more of a conceptual question than a technical one. My understanding of H.264 is that it relies on past and future frames in order to compress video data. Its trivial to take a fully compressed H.264 video file and stream it via RTP or any other protocol of your choice, however, how would this work with real time video In real time video you only have access to past and current frames and dont know the full length of the video, so how can the H.264 codec actually compress the video and prepare it to be an RTP payload Does it simply buffer and chunk the video into an arbitrarily sized smaller video and compress that The only way I can think of this working is to split the video into something like 1 second chunks, compress those as individual videos, and make them the RTP payload. Is this how its done or is there more magic happening than I suspectp

Negative 61 pI am having an issue. I have a bunch of inputs that share the same name. This creates arrays which are placed into the database and that all works fine but I am having a major dilemma in trying to keep the blank rows of inputs from creating blank entries in the database table.p  pThe code is as suchp  precodeforeachPOST[datetime] as dbrowgtstartdate  ifissetPOST[def]  start  startdate  abc  POST[abc][dbrow] def  POST[def][dbrow] ghi  POST[ghi][dbrow]   dbinsert  INSERT INTO tablename start, abc, def, ghi VALUESstart, abc, def, ghi codepre  pThis is fine and dandy but I cant get the if statement to work. The form that is using POST to get the users information has 5 rows of inputs each with fours columns start, abc, def, ghi. If I enter data in the form and submit it, then all the data goes to the database yay  success, if I only enter the data in rows 14 then the database still enters 5 rows of data. What am I doing wrongp  pEDIT Ok so upon a deeper look what appears to be happening is the code keeps wanting to submit ALL of rows of dynamically generated inputs whether they contain content or not. So I devised the following codep  precodedbtur  countarrayfilterstartdate fordbtotalusedrows0dbtotalusedrowsltdbturdbtotalusedrows   dbstartdate  POST[datetime][dbtotalusedrows]  dbabc  POST[abc][dbtotalusedrows] dbdef  POST[def][dbtotalusedrows] dbghi  POST[ghi][dbtotalusedrows]     dbinsert  ..... codepre  pIn theory what this does is dbtur counts up all of the inputs being used under the startdate variable. I then break it into a count array which should be able to be used as dbtotalusedrows. However this doesnt seem to be limiting the total number of rows of inputs being inserted into the database. So I guess its back to the drawing board unless someone else has a better idea of how to accomplish this. Im so ready to give up right now.p

Negative 61 pI have a question about scalability. Lets say I have a multiplayer game, such as Uno, where the server handles everything. Assume this is a textonly game for simplicity. For example, to get information printed out to the user in the client, the server might send codePRINT stringcode, or codeCHOOSE datacode to pick a card to play, etc. In this regard, the client is dumb and the server handles the game logic.p  pA quick example of how this might work on a protocol levelbr Server sends codePRINT Choose a cardcodebr Server sends codeCHOOSE Red 1,Blue 1code  user shown a button or something, and picks Red 1br Client sends codeRed 1codep  pLets say I have this architecturebr emPlayer Classem stores the cards the user has, maybe some methods such as codetellDataString datacode which would send PRINT data, codesendPMcode which could private message a userp  pemServer Classem handles authentication, allows users to create new games, shows users a list of games they can joinp  pemGame Classem handles users playing a card, handles switching to a new player for his or her turn, calls methods on player class like codetellDatacode, codepickCardcode, etcp  pemHow would I scale this, to run the server on multiple computersem Right now, all of the users connect to one server, and require the Player, Server, and Game class to interact with each other. If someone could provide some suggestions, andor point me to some good resourcesbooks on this, it would be greatly appreciated no, this is not a homework assignment or something for a business, this is just a personal project and curiosity of mine. In terms of scalability, Id like to just be able to add another server, and handle the additional load of playersbut the most concurrent connections would be 1000. p  pAlso, would this become significantly more difficult of a scalability challenge if we added in more games p  pFurthermore, what is the best way to store game data In a SQL database, or serializing objects, or what By this, I mean lets say 3 users are in a game of Uno, and want to return to it later. I dont want to store their cards and information about the game in the PlayerServerGame class RAM forever  I want to dump this somewhere, so when the user logs in, the info can be loaded from however this was dumped into RAM, and then the appropriate PlayerGame objects.p  pemFinally, how can I make changes to the server without having to kill it, and restart item Assume the server was written in Java or Python.p  pIf anyone can provide suggestions or some resources it would be greatly appreciated  this includes changing the architecture I originally stated.p  pThanks for any and all helpp  pstrongEDIT Are there any good books or talks you all would recommend on the subjectstrongp

Here is what the content switching jquery looks like p  pfunction contentSwitchersettings         var settings              contentClass  .contentToLoad,            navigationId  sideMenu,            servFront  clickHomeHomep  precode         Hide all of the content except the first one on the nav     settings.contentClass.notfirst.hide     settings.navigationId.findlifirst.addClassactive      onClick set the active state,      hide the content panels and show the correct one     settings.navigationId.finda.clickfunctione         var contentToShow  this.attrhref         contentToShow  contentToShow         dissable normal link behaviour         e.preventDefault         set the proper active class for active state css         settings.navigationId.findli.removeClassactive         this.parentli.addClassactive         hide the old content and show the new         settings.contentClass.hide         contentToShow.showslow           codepre  pcontentSwitcher p  pnote Ive cropped out a bunch of it just to show how it works on a basic level.p  pDoes anyone have any suggestions as to where to begin.

Negative 61 h3Backgroundh3  pIm attempting to write a semiportable Makefile that will be used on Windows without MinGW or Cygwin.  As a result I pretty much have to stick to standard commands provided by Windows.  Im aware of UnxUtils, but Id like to avoid using them as much as possible.  Additionally, Id like to avoid having to write any special batch scripts if I can help it.  The solution will be used on many different computers by people that arent particularly familiar with Linux, Windows, or commandline build systems, so environment paths cant be relied on and additional installations arent possible.  The solution will replace an existing system thats severely lacking in some of the more advanced make system features which are approaching necessity so Im trying to minimize impact of changes by avoiding any new software installs.p  h3Problemh3  pThe problem Im encountering has to do with how make interprets shell commands used as part of a rule.  I simply want to codeechocode a blankline in a way that can also be redirected to a file as part of a few different rules.  In Windows, the only way to echo a blank line is to add a code.code immediately after the echo command, without any spaces codeecho.code.  When provided as a line in a rule it causes issues though.p  precodesomerule     echo.    echo Text going to file gt someFile.txt    echo. gtgt someFile.txt    echo Other text going to a file gtgt someFile.txt codepre  pIn the example provided, the first line codeecho.code and the third line, codeecho. gtgt someFile.txtcode, cause an errorp  precodeprocessbegin CreateProcessNULL, echo., ... failed. codepre  pIve seen some explanations that say there shouldnt be a space on the third line and it should instead be codeecho.gtgt someFile.txtcode, but that makes no difference when I tested it.p  h3Explanationh3  pIm pretty sure the issue comes from the fact that make implements a manual look up of the implicit shell command and is detecting codeecho.code as the command rather than codeechocode.  The resulting error is that it didnt find codeecho..execode or the equivalent as either a command or executable in the environment path, triggering the error indicated above.p  h3Questionh3  pHow do I implement a command as part of a makefile rule to output a blank line such that it would work in the case above  My actual makefile looks more like the following, and Im hoping to replace either the codeECHOcode variable so it operates more like the Linux version of echo, or the codeNEWLINEcode variable so it can actually output a blank line in a way that allows it to either be printed to the terminal or redirected to a file.p  precodeNEWLINEecho.

Negative 61 pIm creating a site using codebootstrap 3.0.3code and implemented the bootstrap carousel in the header. p  pI had been pounding away at the page for days which had appeared to be working properly without issue and then I noticed something unusual. All of the images on the page were at one point at a 100. p  pI hadnt placed them on a grid and so that seemed to me to be normaldefault behavior. Now they are all displaying at their precise dimensions. This of course is affecting my HeroCarousel images when my browser is fully expanded as they are now displaying with some grey space to the right, however, they do resize and fill the page as I reduce the size of my window. p  pIve trouble shot this issue by downloading a fresh copy of bootstrap and creating a new html file code supplied below then adding the carousel template code from the bootstrap website in and placing the images I was using. After doing so, the images are still not bleeding to the edges when my browser is open to its maximum width. p  pIve never had this issue before with bootstrap or the carousel and so Im completely stumped. Is the default width of codeimgcode not 100 because it sure looked like it was in the codebootstrap.csscode file. Additionally Ive added codeimg width100 importantcode to the codeheadcode of my document and everything returned to the way it was before this issue occurred. p  pIm wondering if this is just a change that was made recently and when I updated bootstrap it changed everything And if so, is the carousel not supposed to stretch the image to the edgesp  precodelthtmlgt     ltheadgt         ltmeta charsetutf8gt         ltlink relstylesheet hrefcssbootstrap.cssgt     ltheadgt     ltbodygt         lt Carousel gt         ltdiv idmyCarousel classcarousel slide dataridecarouselgt             lt Indicators gt             ltol classcarouselindicatorsgt                 ltli datatargetmyCarousel dataslideto0 classactivegtltligt                 ltli datatargetmyCarousel dataslideto1gtltligt                 ltli datatargetmyCarousel dataslideto2gtltligt             ltolgt             ltdiv classcarouselinnergt                 ltdiv classitem activegt                     ltimg srcimghero1.jpg altFirst slidegt                     ltdiv classcontainergt                         ltdiv classcarouselcaptiongtltdivgt                     ltdivgt                 ltdivgt                 ltdiv classitemgt                     ltimg srcimghero2.jpg altSecond slidegt                     ltdiv classcontainergt                         ltdiv classcarouselcaptiongtltdivgt                     ltdivgt                 ltdivgt                 ltdiv classitemgt                     ltimg srcimghero3.jpg altThird slidegt                     ltdiv classcontainergt                         ltdiv classcarouselcaptiongtltdivgt                     ltdivgt                 ltdivgt             ltdivgt             lta classleft carouselcontrol hrefmyCarousel dataslideprevgtltspan classglyphicon glyphiconchevronleftgtltspangtltagt             lta classright carouselcontrol hrefmyCarousel dataslidenextgtltspan classglyphicon glyphiconchevronrightgtltspangtltagt         ltdivgt         lt JavaScript gt         ltscript srcjsjquery1.10.2.min.jsgtltscriptgt         ltscript srcjsbootstrap.jsgtltscriptgt     ltbodygt lthtmlgt codepre

Negative 61 pa hrefhttpplnkr.coedit3zxmNKppreview relnofollowhttpplnkr.coedit3zxmNKppreviewap  pI have 2 tables.  They both bind to the same data, but the 2nd table filters on codedesignation parttimecode.  When the codedesignationcode is changed in the 1st table, I want the 2nd table to rerun the filter and update.  For instance, initially there are 2 parttime employees if I change another one to parttime, a 3rd row should appear in the 2nd table.  Now, I have been able to accomplish this using a horrible hack as can be seen in the Plunker.  The hack is to slightly change the filter text to force the table 2nd table to be updated.p  pNow that if the filter text changes on an nggrid, the table will get updated.  In my case, however, it is the actual content, NOT the filter which I want to be changed in this case, codedesignationcode.p  pDoes anyone know how to accomplish this same behavior without this hackp

Negative 61 pI am not sure if this is even a question worth asking or I am just bit too much overworked to think through this hence, the community help would surely be great at this stage to resolve this issue.p  pSo, my question is that I have some 2025 screens in my Android app. The app overall comprises of navigation drawer, tabstrips, fragments and lists in most of those fragments some fragments only have listviews while some fragments have several other components and listviews as well. Now, few of these listviews have slightly similar row views but, not such that I could use the tag include due to placement and size issues. p  pFor example, in rowview1, I have one imageview ImageView1 and three textviews TextView1, TextView2, TextView3 to its right and finally, an imageview ImageView2 on extreme right on whose click an event occurs. Whereas, in rowview2, I have one imageview ImageView1 and three textviews TextView1, TextView2, TextView3 to its right. On extreme right, two more textviews which convey some extra info and an imageview ImageView2 beside ImageView1 and below TextView3. p  pSo, what would be a better and optimized approach in such a scenario 1 Having separate multiple rowview layouts 2 Having one rowview with all the static elements in one place and dynamically adding and removing the extra elements I believe it could be equally expensive for a rowview in a listview.p  pI am not sure if there can be any other approach. Any ideaguidance is most welcome.p  pThanks in advancep

My console program runs as intended on Windows, even when using Mono on Windows. p  pI have a service on our API that requires authentication.

The client is called, goes out to the server and grabs a list of objects as expected.p  pOn Linux however I try to run the app using  mono MyApp.exe arg1 arg2 arg3 it responds with a 302 trying to redirect me to a place to login. Naturally this indicates that ServiceStack was never told about my existing session for this particular request. So... Just to be sure I had closer look at the machine hosting our APIItself hosted with Apachemodmono it appears as if the initial authentication using credentialsauthprovider is working as expected, Im getting back an SSID to use, etc.p  pDigging deeper I had a look at the headers being sent to Apache. When executing this console app from Windows a cookie with the ssid is included in the request for DueRequest shown above as it should be. strongHowever when running the exact same executable with Mono on Linux, the cookie is absent.strong Again, this is running the exact same version of the executable and ServiceStack DLLs.p  pI would have to guess that this is more of a problem with Mono, Im just wondering if anybody has experienced this behavior before when using Mono on Linux  ServiceStack together. p  pstrongFurther infostrongp  pTo confirm that a cookie is not being sent, I went ahead and fired up TCPdump on the API server itself The one running Apachemodmono p  precodetcpdump i eth0 s 1024 l A port 80  egrep w cookieCookie codepre  pWhen making a request from a client that is working, I seep  precodeSetCookie sspidxZ1TG8ED1dhxntBOPLA path expiresSat, 04 Feb 2034 204809 GMT HttpOnly Cookie ssidxZ1TG8ED1dhxntBOPLA codepre  pWhen running with Mono from a Linux terminal p  precodeSetCookie sspidTTIJ2tYOXjRwUwCfvsn path expiresSat, 04 Feb 2034 204917 GMT HttpOnly codepre  pThe server is obviously responding with a cookie... but in the case of the second example the client is never sending one. p

Negative 61 pI am working through a set of online exercises found at Codingbat.com for my own amusement. One set of exercises focuses on recursive programming.

I tried to adapt my previous method, using codesubstringcode instead of codecharAtcodep  precode       public int countHiString str  Given a string, compute recursively no loops the number of times lowercase  hi appears in the string.               if str.lengthlt 2                 return 0             else if str.substring0, 1.equalshi                 return countHistr.substring1  1             else                 return countHistr.substring1               codepre  pHowever, this always returns 0. It looks like the testing conditionp  precode else if str.substring0, 1.equalshi codepre  pis never met, but I cant work out why. Hope someone can helpp  pstrongEDIT strongp  pAs Steve and JustinKSU pointed out, I was returning a single character substring. I thought that the index numbers in the codesubstringcode method referred to the index of characters as if they were stored in an array where 0 would be first character, 1 second etc. It looks like a better way to think about it is that the codesubstringcode indexes represent the count of character separators in the string, starting with a separator preceding the first character, such that codesubstring0, 1code emencapsulatesem the first character.p

Negative 61 pIm not experienced with system administration, nor the technical details of compiling Cbased programs, so bear with me if I say something inaccurate. p  pBasically, Im using a computing cluster that has a relatively old OS Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4.3, from 2006, for which I have no root access. I recurrently run into issues when compiling various programs. One common cause I can see is outdated libraries, notably the C library. I decided to compile a recent version of codeglibccode, thinking that linking to this new C library would solve many of my problems is this sound. That lead me down a rabbit hole of installing a more recent version of codegcccode and its dependencies including modern Linux kernel headers. p  pIn any case, I believe I have a working version of codegcccode.

Negative 61 pSo I am trying to find the distance between 2 markers. In the code, I place one marker on a left click and save the position of the marker to a variable start. I then place a second marker on a left click and save the position of that marker to a variable end. I then call a function to calculate the distance between the marker but it seems that the getPosition function isnt picking up the LatLng in the correct format. I am a bit confused on why it wont work. p  pCode is shown below. Any help would be greatly appreciated.

Negative 61 pIm currently designing a database to be implemented in SQL Server.

I believe this is because the constraint is trying to reference codeConfigIdcode, only one half of the composite key, and for this to work Id need to reference the codeClientIdcode too, is that correct p  pBut my problem is that I first did the design for this database in MYSQL Workbench, and there I indicated that codeConfigurationcode and codeMailcode, as well as codeClient and Configurationcode, have a 1n identifying relationship because a codeMailcode instance cannot be created if there isnt a codeConfigurationcode instance first, and at the same time a codeConfigurationcode instance cannot exist without having being assigned to a codeClientcode first, and as such it created the composite keys for codeConfigurationcode and codeMailcode. You can see a picture of that a hrefhttpi.imgur.com4LzYNtR relnofollowherea.p  pSo my question is, how can I translate this identifying relationship to SQL Server Or is that not possiblep  pstrongEDITstrong As suggested I will remove the composite keys from the codeConfigurationcode table, albeit my question still stands emIf I have a 1n identifying relationship where one of the tables involved uses composite keys, how can I display this on SQL Serverem Or is such a case never supposed to happenp  pstrong2ND EDITstrong To anyone who might come across this question, a hrefhttpstackoverflow.coma28148101499934thisa post is well worth a read.

Negative 61 pIm building custom WP theme and I have issues with sliders. None of those Ive tried to install worked. When I looked into the developers console, and searched for their jscss files, they where not there. Not in the header or the footer.

There are no js errors, because there are no files to cause them. WP version is 3.8.3. jQuery 1.9.3 is included and working fine.

Negative 61 pI have a PHPMySQL program that generates a large excel workbook to make distributing it easier. i had been outputting one large xml file from PHP with multiple worksheets within one workbook. But the file has gotten unwieldy at over 1 mb in size in addition to being very hard to debug whenever theres a problem in the xml.p  pI am now outputting each worksheet as a separate file and reading them in separately using OpenXML. It allows me to debug each sheet and I only have to update the sheets that change. I read the xml into a temporary workbook using openxml, then copy the sheet to the master workbook. However, when openxml runs, it tries to resolve all references to other sheets. I say cancel and let it run. But the cells with references to other sheets have REF in them. If I put the cursor in the formula and hit return, it resolves correctly. But I cant do that individually on every of thousands of formulas with references to other sheets.p  pIs there a way to read an xml file right into the existing master workbook p  pIs there a way to have excel reevaluate all formulas as if I clicked on it and hit enterp  pPeterp

Negative 61 pI am working for an project in which i need to listen from the several clients very often, do some processing on that and save the processed data into the database. I used producer and consumer approach for it. This can only insert or update.p  pAnd then user open separate application which is GUI Swing baseto see this data mostly though JTable. Whenever any new entries made to the database then it should be visible on GUI as well automatically. Through GUI user can allow to update or delete the data.p  pMy doubt is which design pattern should i use for it. What i thought to use singleton in the first case as only 1 connection is allowed and insertion is allowed one after another.p  pfor GUI i am not able to figure out what to use.p  pInitially i thought to use MVC but i thought it would make my code more complex as my viewer and controller1st part is not related. person who login from GUI is not contact or linked with the 1st part.

Negative 61 pWe have the following requirements for an online payment solutionp  ul liThere are two types of users Buyers and sellers.li liOnly digital stuff is exchanged.li liWhen a buyer buys content, money is sent to the seller immediately as well as a small fraction of the money to the website owners.li liA buyer must before he can sell his offerings connect his account that may be PayPal or any other service to the platform to be able to receive money.li ul  pNow, Im not an expert in this field but my initial idea was to have a PayPal account with Mass Transactions enabled for this website which will receive all payments and then send money out to the sellers via API calls.p  pHowever, it would be very nice if it is possible to make this process completely external, a.k.a. use a service for payment which sends the bulk of the money to the seller but a small fraction to the shareholders website owners. Of course, a seller must first connect his account to the platform to make sure in case one of his offerings was bought he can receive money.p  pAny ideas are well appreciated.p
Negative 61 pI need to write a customized function that will be called many times by other fixed functions. In this function, at the first called time, it will return the total number of lines of a file. The second called time of this function, forward, will return the number of lines in small sections of this file. My question is how I keep the first returned resulttotal number of lines of a file and use it for the next called times of my function. I need to write or declare any thing only in this functionnot in the caller. Something like thisp  precodemyFunctionInput, MyResult, FirstResult     calculateInputFunctionInput, Result,    ,    MyResult is Result,    ... . codepre  pThe problem is, every time myFunction is called, it receives different Input and returns different MyResult. But I would like to keep the first MyResult to use for next called times of myFunction. How can I do that Thanks very much for your answer in advance. p  precodemyFunction[V1,V2], Result    reset,   cachedallaV1,V2,   use V1, V2 to calculate Result,    ...   reset,   finishedCode.  codepre  pThe above is my function, there are other functions that will call myFunction by transfering value of V1, V2 to this function and get Result back.       p

Negative 61 pIm creating an activity tracker similar to the Moves app that seeks to track steps, distance, calories and active time.p  pFor Iphone5s devices, I am using the built in M7 chip to determine Steps, and then making estimates at the rest from that.  For M7 devices I never use GPS.  There is basically no battery drain and the interpolated numbers are reasonable enough for the need.  This gets walkingrunning data reasonably enough.p  pHowever to support Iphone5 and Iphone4 at least, I need to use GPS to get location and then interpolate steps and calories from the distance.  Im running into significant battery drain issues somewhat expected, and am seeking advice on how to minimize this.  Im also using the accelerometer in addition to speed to help make an educated guess on activity type walking,running,biking,transportp  pSome things Ive tried for GPS optimizationp  ol listrongDeferred Updatesstrong  The Iphone5 and a minimum version of IOS supports this.  The code to do this is straight forward, however whether the device actually uses it is questionable.  Ive only seen it work on 1 out of 4 devices, where it does regularly.  3 other devices have never deferred updates from the same code.  Another user suggested other apps prevent the device from sleeping, including when I had Moves also installed. This thus hasnt helped much beyond theory.li listrongReduce Accuracystrong reduce the accuracy of continuous location polling.  I started at High, but reduced to 10m, then hundreds of meters, etc.  This doesnt seem to help and polling still seems to occur at a regular interval anyway.li listrongstartMonitoringSignificantLocationChangesstrong  In order to reduce endless gps polling when the user may not be moving for hours at a time especially at night, I switched from continuous polling to significant changes only after the device stopped moving for an arbitrary 2 minutes.  I then re enable continuous tracking after any significant location update.  This works pretty much as expected if it stops tracking then battery drain slows, and when it resumes continuously, battery drain resumes.  Further, if a user starts walking, there is no guarantee of a significant motion event for some time. This is very poor for accuracy.  Sometimes it doesnt seem to resume at all.li ol  pIve been relatively impressed that the Moves app, among others is able to track location so well with respectable battery drain.  It can go most of a day until needing a charge.  With my code, users have reported full battery drain in a couple of hours.p  pWhat kind of optimizations could be used to improve this but still maintain a reasonable accuracy in tracking movementp  pstrongPROGRESS UPDATEstrong strongstartMonitoringSignificantLocationChangesstrong.  I set this up with a timer that switches to significant monitoring after 2 minutes of inactivity not moving.  Normal location tracking is then resumed again on any significant change, or when the app becomes active from reopening. This seems to work well.  My phone still goes from 100 to 10 in 8 hours overnight of sitting around.  It is an old iphone with some battery troubles, but normally it might just lose 3040 uncharged overnight with no apps running. I need to test more, but startMonitoringSignificantLocationChanges still seems to use some battery.p  pFurther, startMonitoringSignificantLocationChanges has some expected accuracy issues in terms of when it restarts the app.  In rural setting, it can go several kilometers before restarting.  This could be okay for a long drive, but strongif I want to catch a 30 minute walk, it may miss that entirely.strong In urban setting it seems to kick in within 23 blocks of movement, which is reasonable.p  pEven if I used continuous location tracking that stoppedstarted on a timer to check for movement, Id still likely have worst case of a minute of lag between restarts before resuming continuous logging.p  pstrongPROGRESS UPDATE 2strongp  pSignificant change updates described above have a fatal flaw for me they dont always start fast enough.  Sometimes it takes 12 miles it seems   p  pAs an a better approach, Ive tried keeping continuous location updates on, but toggling the desiredAccuracy property from high to low accuracy when the device is not moving.  This should essentially turn the GPS receiver off during inactivity.  Ive been experimenting between 100meter and 1km accuracy for inactivity with promising results.  It does seem to use slightly more batter than only using significant change monitoring, but it seems more responsive as well.p

This is why I am using these, but this is kind of irrelevant to what Im actually struggling with. p  pSo lets assume I have a class which contains an array of lambdas. This class has a method which will run all these lambas in sequence using Q, aborting on error. Exactly what I would achieve with the following code p  precodeQ.fcalldoSomething.thendoSomethingElse.failreportError codepre  pHowever, in this case codedoSomethingcode and codedoSomethingElsecoderesides in an array of functions, rather than a fixed number of steps. This is because I want it to be reusable, i.e. being able to run in multiple scenarios depending on the task at hand. So I want to avoid hardcoding the chain of functions to run.  p

Negative 61 pI am looking to implement a menu like used on the Android Uber app.  p  pIt seems to be like an action bar on top with 3 small settings stripes on left side.  probably not a real action barbr When clicking in that area a black menu slides out from the left and occupies 70 of the screen.br The right side of the screen still showing the map is darkened to keep focus on the menu.  p  pI like that style, it looks good and everyone immediately knows how to use it.br I would like to have the same but dont know where to start or if there is maybe something available that would do something similar.  p  pThe actionbar itself only offers the menu on top right which is better for pure settings.br I also experimented with a split action bar having the menu items on bottom but that also seems superior to the clean interface Uber provides.  p

Negative 61 pMany times I read that data in NOSQL databases is stored denormalized. For instance consider a chess game record. It may not only contain the player ids that participate in the chess game, but also the first and lastname of that player. I suppose this is done because joins are not possible in NOSQL, so if you just duplicate data you can still retrieve all the data you want in one call without manual application level processing of the data.p  pWhat I dont understand is that now when you want to update a chessplayers name, you will have to write a query that updates both the chessgame records in which that player participates as well as the player record of that player. This seems like a huge performance overhead as the database will have to search all games where that player participates in and then update each of those records.p  pIs it true that data is often stored denormalized like in my examplep

There are already other websites published on the same network that    use IE8 with no problem.   Tried to disable all javascripts in both login.aspx and Master page.   Tried to add  codeltmeta httpequivXUACompatible contentIEedgegtcode  with different values in content IE8, IEEmulateIE8... with no luck.p  ul liRunning the application from VS solution on deployment server works fine, but after publishing on IIS, same problem occurs.li ul  pAny suggestionsp  pEdit I could narrow the resolution area IE 8 does not keep session variables  I tried to redirect the login to a plain page that doesnt use session variables and it worked.  Also, when I replaced the session variable with a constant value in the directed page, it worked.  So the questions becomes how to preserve session variables between pages programmaticallyp

Negative 61 pI would like to use codegsubcode to replace every occurrence of a backslash in a string with 2 backslashes.p  pCurrently, what I have I tried is codegsub, , xcode. This doesnt seem to work though. However, if I change the expression to instead replace each backslash with a, it works fine.p  precodegt gsub, ,  [1]  gt gsub, a,  [1] a gt gsub, ,  [1]  codepre  pThe last character is only a single backslash R just prints 2 because it prints escaped characters with the backslash. Using codencharcode confirms that the length is 1.p  pWhat causes this functionality The second argument to codegsubcode isnt a regular expression, so having 4 backslashes in the string literal should be converted to a character with 2 backslashes. It makes even less sense that the first codegsubcode call above returns an empty string.p

Negative 61 pI am trying to build my own calendar control in WPFXAML, both as an exercise and to be used in a hobby project. This calender will be a grid where each cell obviously represents a day in the chosen month. Each cell should be able to display a list of items. The inputs for the calendar should be an identification of a month and a list of days. Those days will be of a custom type, something likep  precodepublic class CalendarDay      public int DayNumber get set     public ListltDayItemgt Items get set  codepre  pwhere a codeDayItemcode could represent something like an appointment or a todo.p  pIm implementing this as a user control. The XAML for this calendar is a codeControlTemplatecode that contains a codeUniformGridcode of 1x7 for the day names data bound to a collection 7 strings and a codeUniformGridcode of 6x7 for the days data bound to a collection of codeCalendarDaycode.p  pA view user control that emcontainsem this calendar conceptually looks like thisp  precodeltUserControl namemyView ... xmlnscalclrnamespacethe calendar namespacegt      ltGridgt         ltcalCalendar DaysBinding DaysWithItems CurrentMonthBinding DisplayMonth gt     ltGridgt  ltUserControlgt codepre  pAs Im applying MVVM, codemyViewcode will have a DataContext that is set to some view model class that has a property codeDaysWithItemscode a list of codeCalenderDaycode instances and a property codeDisplayMonthcode.p  pIdeally, the consumer of this calendar control should only have to provide the two inputs as mentioned. Moreover, codeDaysWithItemscode should, from codemyViewcodes point of view pun is coincidental, be a list of 28, 29, 30 or 31 elements, depending on the month. This means that the list should somehow be padded to 42 items. I think this should be the responsibility of the calendar control, not codemyViewcodes view model.p  pNote that Im also not provding the day names. This too should be the responsibility of the calendar control. This shouldnt be provided explicitly.p  pHeres my problem. If, in the calendars control template, I want to bind to the string collection for the day names and the 42 element collection of codeCalendarDaycode, the datacontext should be the codeCalendarcode class itself because of the responsibilities I explained earlier. On the other hand, in codemyViewcode, Im binding the calendar to codemyViewcodes codeDaysWithItemscode the logical collection that contains 28..31 elements, so there the calendars datacontext should be codemyViewcodes view model.p  pCan I use some sort of internal datacontext  internal to the control template and also some sort of external datacontext  a datacontext as provided by the consumer of the calendar controlp

Negative 61 pI have a a system which has high concurrency rate. In a web service method which tamper the entity data, I place a pessimistic read lock on the entity under processing to avoid multiple access to the entity in 2 different web service call threads. However, it seem that if there is 2 access in the same moment, one of the locks proceed while the other thread lock is hanged until the transaction is timed out. I thought that if requesting 2 locks at the same moment, Eclipselink should reject any lock request on a entity that is already locked by another thread and throw an exception immediately, but what happens here is that the second lock is hanged until the transaction is timed out. Is this a bug in eclipselink If we assume its a bug, is there any way to detect if an entity is locked, so that If there is already a lock on the enity, I can avoid calling lock again in any other thread that will call lock on the entityp

Negative 61 pI am confused as my application is leaking memory. It is a tcp server that process hundreds of thousands of packets per minute. I have checked the code, improved it and profiled the memory.p  pEverything seems okay, testing locally with low traffic actually shows that the gc releases the memory properly. But when on the live heavy traffic server it doesnt.p  pSo I tried using the codeexposegccode option and added the forced gc to every disconnection and now I found that the memory is not leaking anymore or was it every even leakingp  pSo, my conclusion is the gc didnt activate. My server has 3GB of memory and the application in just a few hours gets to eat 2.8GB of that.p  pNow with the forced gc the application is not leaking anymore. It is maintaining around 200MB of memory.p  pSo, my question, why wasnt the gc getting triggeredp

Any idea how to do this so that only the role being affected recycles instead of all roles recyclingp  pMy codep  precode    public void AddInstance              XDocument configDoc  this.GetDeploymentConfiguration         var ns  configDoc.Root.GetDefaultNamespace          configDoc.Root             .Elements ns  Role              .FirstOrDefault r gt r.Attribute name .Value.ToLower  this.RoleName.ToLower              .Element ns  Instances              .Attribute count              .Value   int.Parse configDoc.Root                            .Elements ns  Role                             .FirstOrDefault r gt r.Attribute name .Value.ToLower  this.RoleName.ToLower                             .Element ns  Instances                             .Attribute count                             .Value   1 .ToString          string encodedString  Convert.ToBase64String Encoding.UTF8.GetBytes configDoc.ToString           this.SetDeploymentConfig encodedString            public XDocument GetDeploymentConfiguration              string uri  string.Format this.servicePropertiesOperationFormat, this.subscriptionID, this.serviceName, production,           ServiceManagementOperation operation  new ServiceManagementOperation this.thumbprint, this.versionID           var xdoc operation.Invoke uri          var myelm  xdoc.Element wa  Deployment .Element wa  Configuration           var mystring  Encoding.UTF8.GetString Convert.FromBase64String myelm.Value            return XDocument.Parse mystring            public string SetDeploymentConfig string configurationFile               string uri  string.Format this.servicePropertiesOperationFormat, this.subscriptionID, this.serviceName, production, compconfig          ServiceManagementOperation operation  new ServiceManagementOperation this.thumbprint, this.versionID          string payloadString  string.Format             ltxml version1.0 encodingutf8gt             ltChangeConfiguration xmlnshttpschemas.microsoft.comwindowsazuregt                     ltConfigurationgt0ltConfigurationgt             ltChangeConfigurationgt, configurationFile           XDocument payload  XDocument.Parse payloadString          return operation.Invoke uri, payload       codepre
Negative 61 pIm very new to python doing it as a first year level course at university and I installed WindIDE as was recommended by the course convenors, as well as a Python 3.4.2 package for Mac OS 10.6.

Negative 61 pIm working on an Excel sheet with 15k rows. I need to find out empty cells in a particular column and output the row corresponding containing the empty cell. Is there any way I can do thisp
Negative 61 pHello I need to merge two data frames. The relevant ID columns of the two data frames contain commaseparated lists of IDs as string. p  pFor example those two data frames should be mergedp  precodeID             value    abc,def,ghi  5 jkl          8 stu,xyz      2       ID             value def,xyz      7 klm          6 opq,stu      9 codepre  pMy matching criterion would be positive if any of the individual ids in one IDlist is also present in the other. So the merged data frame should look like for a leftjoin like mergep  precodeID             value.Data.frame.1   value.Data.frame.2 def,xyz      5                    7 jkl          8                    NA stu,xyz      2                    9 stu,xyz      2                    7               codepre  pMy real data actually has more than one value column in the data frames. Usually for the merge I would do something likep  precode mergedata.frame1, data.frame2, byID, all.xTRUE codepre  pin which case I only merge rows with exact string equality in the ID columns.p  pIs it possible to override the match criterion in the merge function somehow Or is there another efficient way to achieve the same goal in Rp

Negative 61 pstrongBackgroundstrong I am doing ajax calls to a PHP script which returns data to fill a form based on some file key a user inputs.

Negative 61 pIm programming my first 2D game in Qt.p  pI have QWidged where I draw my game isometric view. When mouse enters border of widget it moves map view like in every strategy game.... p  pAnd here is my trouble... Im tracking mouse position with mouseMoveEvent but it fires only when mouse moves only when position changes. So map moves only when I move mouse at borders. If mouse stand still, map does not move mouseMoveEvent is not triggered. And I have no idea how to solve this. Its annoying when you try to play it.p  pThis is my first post here.. and I hope that I explained my problem clearly  p  pbEditb little more clarify br Imagine this you want to move map. So you move mouse to the edge of screen QWidget but at the moment when you stop mouse, map stops moving too. But mouse is still at edge of screen. What I want to do is that map will still move after mouse stops at edge.p

Negative 61 pI am a little confused, so Ill start by explaining my understanding and hopefully someone can correct me and explain where I am going wrong. In C arguments are passed by value, so if we want to change the pointer from within a function that it is being passed to, we must define the argument as a pointertopointer, such that we can then modify the actual pointer rather than the value. If this is correct, could someone explain how does the sprintf function, for example, manage to change the str pointerp

Negative 61 pLets say I as an app developer want to encrypt something with a key thats stored somewhere in my app. Ultimately, I have to load that key into memory and pass it, along with the plaintext data, to some Java class in javax.crypto. Since those classes are provided by the JVM at runtime, if an attacker is able to control the JVM and swap out the implementation of those classes on his own Android device, hell be able to see both the key and the plain text that my app wants to encrypt. And since Android is opensource, anyone can modify it and build it to run on their own device, and run my app on it. Wouldnt that mean that they can steal my apps key and see my plaintextp  pIf so, is there any way to protect against that For example, use a thirdparty crypto library thats included in my APK Although someone could just as easily decompile the APK and swap out those classes too, couldnt theyp

Negative 61 pSo I came across a very strange problem in writing a convenience function to count the number of rows in each dataframe in a list of dataframes.

Negative 61 pI have some nested objects, PackageDocumentsPages.  The package contains a set of documents, the document contains a set of pages.  I have the relationship with PagesDocuments and DocumentsPages both set to EAGER because when I request a package I want it to get all of the documents along with all of the pages.p  pNow I have another requirement to get only the PackageDocuments, but I dont want to also retrieve DocumentPages because this query needs to be more efficient and doesnt need that data.  p  pIs there a way using the same model objects that I can turn off the EAGER fetch  Or is there a way I can change it to LAZY and then force it to be eager without having to loop through every document in the package and call getPagesp  pWhats the preferred, most efficient way of doing thisp

It seems like its getting stuck on the hover in.

Negative 61 pIve written a short Python script to pull a popular image from a randomlyselected subreddit every day, and then set it as my desktop background. Im on a Macbook, 10.9.5, Mavericks. p  pThe first thing I do is grab a random image from coderSomeSubRedditcode and then save it as codetoday.jpgcode. So, every day, I rewrite codetoday.jpgcode. This all works fine. The problem happens when I try to run the followingp  precode Setting the desktop background              def changedesktopbackgroundfile                 print Now changing desktop background...                 ws  NSWorkspace.sharedWorkspace                 fileurl  NSURL.fileURLWithPathfile                 for screen in NSScreen.screens                     result, error  ws.setDesktopImageURLforScreenoptionserrorfileurl, screen, , None             changedesktopbackgroundDIR  today.jpg codepre  pIf Im starting from a fresh desktop background i.e. some emotherem image, not codetoday.jpgcode, then it works fine. I run my code.pycode and it changes it to the reddit image. If I try to run it emagainem, codetoday.jpgcode will be overwritten successfully  but it doesnt refresh the background.p  pI have a vague understanding that the Mac desktop background stuff changed between 10.8.x and 10.9.x e.g. after reading through a hrefhttpsderflounder.wordpress.com20131026mavericksdesktopbackgroundpicturesettingsmovedfromlibrarypreferencescomappledesktopplist relnofollowthisa, and that this may be the problem. I read somewhere something about Mac saving localcached copies of your desktop image... somewhere. So my suspicion is that trying to refresh the background using a different image emwith the same file nameem is the problem.p  pIndeed, if I rename the file to, say, todays date so code2015July21.jpgcode, code2015July22.jpgcode, etc., it works. But Id really prefer to overwrite a file named codetoday.jpgcode to avoid crazy proliferation of old desktop background images. Though I guess I could use codeshutilcode or something to delete past images, any tips to avoid this would be appreciated.p

Negative 61 pI am trying to calculate some statistics for a moving window and am using rollapply in the zoo package. My question is how do I get rollapply to apply that function to the previous n observations instead of the current observation and the previous n1 observations as align right seems to do.  p  precoderequirezoo z lt data.framex111111, x2111211, x3as.Date31131generate data outputltdata.framedateszx3,                    rollapplyz[,12],by.columnTRUE, 5, max, fillNA, alignright codepre  pI have a hunch this is answered by rollapply If width is a plain numeric vector its elements are regarded as widths to be interpreted in conjunction with align whereas if width is a list its components are regarded as offsets. In the above cases if the length of width is 1 then width is recycled for every byth point. If width is a list its components represent integer offsets such that the ith component of the list refers to time points at positions i  width[[i]]. But I have no idea what that means in terms of R code an no example is provided.p
