Positive 14012 pMaking a game. My folder tree looks like this ClassHoleContentDB, Screens, Utilities. and ClassHoleGraphicsCharacers, Items, Effects, etc. HeroSelectscn is in the Screens folder. I want to make a character select screen with a TileList. My character MovieClips are in ClassHoleContentDBCharacters. They are made with the graphics from GraphicsCharacters. Id like to use the single image from ClassHoleGraphicsCharactersPlayablePokemonRbySphHeros and they images are 0.png, 1.png, etc. At first I thought that I could just reference the character MovieClip but that didnt work.

Positive 14012 pIve stumbled onto yet another fatal Flash bug, which I barely nauseous enough to describe.p  pStoring things in array such as below is common. levelDataEdible is an array containing strings. You access it to find out a string based on the current level. This has worked until suddenly, without reason.p  precodestatic public var comboType14Array               [Bomb,             Constants.levelDataEdible[Constants.currentLevel],             Gem,             Constants.levelDataEdible[Constants.currentLevel],             Gem,             Constants.levelDataEdible[Constants.currentLevel],             Frog          ]  static public var levelDataEdibleArray  [ null, Fish, Golfball, Gloves, Logger, Burger, Beer, Snowshoes, Smore, Pontoon, Binocular] codepre  pYou have to dynamically create the variable.  Access it by strong[classname][match]strong. In this case strongScoreKeep[match]strongp  precodevar matchString  comboType  StringConstants.currentLevel codepre  pThen, whats new and changed, is that now the result is always for currentLevel  1. Even if currentLevel  5 or 7. p  pFlash does not evaluate variables inside of arrays based on their current state. I dont know what it does, but this works fine in dozens of other areas of the game. For some malicious reason, not here.p  pAmazingly, I cant even engineer a workaround. Ive tried putting a function in the array that returns the string for the currentLevel, and instead of the string it returns Function function or some nonsense. p  pI even tried converting the array into a vector, duplicating the array, copying the string values to another array, no matter WHAT I do, Flash figures out a way to stop me. Its really, truly something else. Inhuman, malicious. p

Positive 14012 pSo, the way flash works is that it requires user input in the same frame that a codefile.savecode is called, otherwise it throws an error.p  h2Problemh2  pIm using alivePDF to render out a PDF of some things on screen from my web app. It takes a few seconds to render everything, so the user is left looking at the same screen without being able to click anything, then the save dialogue pops up. I want to throw up a loading screen, just so the user is aware of whats happening. However, it wont render on screen while the PDF is being created, since the frame hasnt ended yet, so the loading screen appears just as the save dialogue is promped, so theyre left looking at the same screen still.p  h2My Temporary Solutionh2  pWhat I ended up doing was waiting for the PDF to load before prompting the save dialogue. However, as I said before, flash will throw an error without user input on that frame. So, I added a save button that prompts the dialogue. This is less than ideal, because then its like 3 clicks to save a PDF and its just less than desirable. Click the savePDF button, wait, click the save button again, then click the save dialogues save button. See my issuep  pIs there a way to delay the user input by 1 or 2 frames so flash will let me call the codesavecode dialogue automatically Or maybe force a render call midframe to show the loading screen while the PDF is getting ready, so that the user input, the loading screen, and the codesavecode dialogue are called in the same frame, but the render is called at the onset of the PDF loadingp

Positive 14012 pIm making an endless straight road from top to bottom and using a single bitmapData for it that I use in multiple tiles. Those tiles are arranged correctly from top to bottom lets say top to bottom of screen by using a formula that calculates what their scale values should be. The scale value of the first tile is calculated according to its position then all other tile are calculated according to their previous tile. This works great except that when everything loops I can see the bottom tile the first one having its width getting slightly larger than it should around 5 pixels too large. When that first tile goes out of screen its sent back to the top of screen and the next tile takes the role of top tile, etc ... But because of the slight width enlargement the road has a slight jump in size when the transition occurs. So that means my formula is close but slightly wrong in calculating the scale of the first tile. What is wrong with the formula and what should be correctedp  precodevar speedFactorNumber  speed  lengthsize of screen top to bottom  var bitmapRoadTile  tiles[0]  bitmap.y  speedFactor  bitmap.y scaled speed       var distanceNumber  length  bitmap.ycalculate position and determine scale            ifdistance lt 0      distance  length  Math.absdistance  else      distance  bitmap.y             var scaleNumber  distance  length     bitmap.scaleX  bitmap.scaleY  scale   scale is calculated but is slightly wrong. codepre  pYou can see the result here a hrefhttpangrybot.ustestsroad relnofollowhttpangrybot.ustestsroadap  pNotice the bottom of the screen where the width of the road slightly changes and then jumps back to normal when the top tile is removed and sent back to the beginning.  I now got a better result by applying a mask but thats really just a hack.  I also got a better result by adjusting the scale of the top tile according to the width it needs to be at the bottom of the screen. Still not perfect though. p  pI think I know what Im missing and Im gonna work on that adding in the formula the angle of the graphic. Here the tile side have a angle of 28 the engine works with tile of different side angle. Basically the angle needs to be added to the formula so that when the top tile moves down, its new scale is calculated according to what the tile width needs to be at the bottom of the screen that width needs to always be the same so no jump occur in the road displayp

Positive 14012 pIm using dropbox to distribute large swf files with corresponding html files that load the swfs. All the large swf files access a small Key swf in the same folder as the html file. That all works fine. But when the large swf files also try to access a remote text file on my server I get a security sandbox violation. After reading about this, I see that this is by design for security reasons. p  pBut there has to be a way around this without having the user authorize the domain containing the txt file. The reason I say this is because the swf files are running right from the browser on the persons computer. I then thought about a cross domain policy. Not sure what it would look like since its a local computer thats asking. I hope this makes sense. I was hoping I could put the cross domain policy or some other file on the users computer right along with the other files, but I dont think thats what theyre for.p  pThis is an update to the question above as my problems relate to crossdomain policys.

Negative 14012 pI am developing a .NET 2.0 WinForms utility that connects to a SQL Server 2005 database. I have found reference material, such as a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions42833howdoiavoidhavingthedatabasepasswordstoredinplaintextinsourcecodeAvoiding Plaintext Passwordsa for handling the actual encryption of the connection string data. I now need to implement the encryption during the installation process so that an administrator can install the utility on a users desktop, but not provide the user with the database connection information.p  pThe sample code all seems geared toward performing the encrypting within the primary application. So the app would need to be executed once for the encryption to take place. If the application is installed but not executed, the configuration information would be in plain text in the configuration file.p  pCan anyone provide information showing how the encryption can be performed from the setup app. Other approaches to the problem are welcome as well however, due to business requirements, I am not in a position to require Windows authentication for the database connection  I am limited to SQL Server authentication.p  pstrongEditstrong I may have been overly brief with my description. We have already performed a risk assessment and determined that using the builtin .NET framework functionality for encrypting the connection information provides sufficient security for the application. p  pWe understand that a truly determined individual could eventually obtain the connection information, and we readily accept that risk. The purpose of encrypting the connection data is to simply raise the bar of effort and to help keep honest people honest.p  pHaving already worked out the means of performing the encryption, I am now trying to work out a method of performing the encryption from within the installation process.

Negative 14012 pWere embarking on a new middle tier service that will allow internal client systems to create and update and query records in some underlying data stores.

And it should be done in runtime, without coding and redeployment, because it will be done by customers or administrators, not developers.p  pWhat approaches and tools would you consider for storing such data Will it be separate table for each class of objects and altering table each time structure is changed, or 1tomany relationship between object and its property values like table StringProperties with fields ObjectID, PropertyID, StringValue or one big table for all objects with generic fields StringField1, NumericField2, etcp  pHow would you make indexing workp  pWould you consider using less mainstream tools like CouchDB Are there any other tools I should know aboutp  pAre there any existing examples of application with similar idea  allowing users to define and augment their own data structuresp  pEDIT I do not expect anyone to solve my entire design problem. Rough ideas or links to tools like CouchDB or Prevayler are more than welcome. Any article links are welcome too.p

This is preserved in the RecursiveIteratorIterator because each set of results represents a separate Iterator and thus keyvalue pairs.p  pAnyway, what I am trying to do now is find the best way to combine these, such that when I iterate over the new iterator, I can get the key is the class name from the codedefinedclassescode iterator and the value is the original file path, alap  precodeforeachclassesandpaths as filepath gt class       print class gt filepath outputs      Class A gt file1.php      Class B gt file1.php      Class C gt file2.php  codepre  pAnd thats where Im stuck thus far.p  pAt the moment, the only solution that is coming to mind is to create a new RecursiveIterator, that overrides the current method to return the outer iterator key which would be the original filepath, and key method to return the current iterator value. But Im not favouring this solution becausep  ul liIt sounds complex which means the code will look hideous and it wont be intuitiveli liThe business rules are hardcoded inside the class, whereas I would like to define some generic Iterators and be able to combine them in such a way to produce the required result.li ul  pAny ideas or suggestions gratefully recieved.p  pI also realise there are far faster, more efficient ways of doing this, but this is also an exercise in using Iterators for myselfm and also an exercise in promoting code reuse, so any new Iterators that have to be written should be as minimal as possible and try to leverage existing functionality.p  pThanksp

Negative 14012 pI generally try to use unit tests for any code that has easily defined correct behavior given some reasonably small, welldefined set of inputs.  This works quite well for catching bugs, and I do it all the time in my personal library of generic functions.  p  pHowever, a lot of the code I write is data mining code that basically looks for significant patterns in large datasets.  Correct behavior in this case is often not well defined and depends on a lot of different inputs in ways that are not easy for a human to predict i.e. the math cant reasonably be done by hand, which is why Im using a computer to solve the problem in the first place.  These inputs can be very complex, to the point where coming up with a reasonable test case is near impossible.  Identifying the edge cases that are worth testing is extremely difficult.  Sometimes the algorithm isnt even deterministic.  p  pUsually, I do the best I can by using asserts for sanity checks and creating a small toy test case with a known pattern and informally seeing if the answer at least looks reasonable, without it necessarily being objectively correct.  Is there any better way to test these kinds of casesp

Negative 14012 pHeres the problem I am trying to solve I have recently completed a data layer redesign that allows me to loadbalance my database across multiple shards.  In order to keep shards balanced, I need to be able to migrate data from one shard to another, which involves copying from shard A to shard B, and then deleting the records from shard A.  But I have several tables that are very big, and have many foreign keys pointed to them, so deleting a single record from the table can take more than one second.p  pIn some cases I need to delete millions of records from the tables, and it just takes too long to be practical.p  pDisabling foreign keys is not an option.  Deleting large batches of rows is also not an option because this is a production application and large deletes lock too many resources, causing failures.  Im using Sql Server, and I know about partitioned tables, but the restrictions on partitioning and the license fees for enterprise edition are so unrealistic that they are not possible.p  pWhen I began working on this problem I thought the hard part would be writing the algorithm that figures out how to delete rows from the leaf level up to the top of the data model, so that no foreign key constraints get violated along the way.  But solving that problem did me no good since it takes weeks to delete records that need to disappear overnight.p  pI already built in a way to mark data as virtually deleted, so as far as the application is concerned, the data is gone, but Im still dealing with large data files, large backups, and slower queries because of the sheer size of the tables.p  pAny ideas  I have already read older related posts here and found nothing that would help.p

Negative 14012 pIve come across a strange scenario related to class inheritance in ObjectiveC.p  pLets say i have three classes A, B and C that inherit from a base class X. Classes A, B and X have the constructorp  precode idInitWithStringNSStringsomeString andDelegateidltSomeProtocolgtaDelegate codepre  pthe only difference being that every class uses a different protocol for the delegate.p  pWhat happens is that for A and B the compiler tries to use the method from C. A warning informs me that the protocols required by class Cs constructor is not implemented by the provided delegate. There is nothing wrong with the delegate itself, since each class has a delegate that implements the right protocol for the classes own constructor. Everything works fine at run time and the right functions are called for all classes.p  pI tried having the constructors return A, B or C instead of the anonymous id, though this still doesnt solve the problem.p  pThe only thing that works is making a cast to the right class like thisp  precodeinstanceOfA  [A[A alloc] InitWithString andDelegateaDelegate] codepre  pThis seems superfluous and unnecessary. Im probably missing something obvious here.p

Negative 14012 pI was posting some comments in a a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions2915395cachelayerformvcmodelorcontrollerrelated questiona about MVC caching and some questions about actual implementation came up. How does one implement a Modellevel cache that works transparently without the developer needing to manually cache, yet still remains efficientp  blockquote   pI would keep my caching   responsibilities firmly within the   model. It is none of the controllers   or views business where the model is   getting data. All they care about is   that when data is requested, data is   provided  this is how the MVC   paradigm is supposed to work.p blockquote  pSource a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions2915395cachelayerformvcmodelorcontroller29154692915469Post by Jarrodap  pThe reason I am skeptical is because caching should usually not be done unless there is a real need, and shouldnt be done for things like search results. So somehow the Model itself has to know whether or not the SELECT statement being issued to it is worthy of being cached. Wouldnt the Model have to be astronomically smart, andor store statistics of what is being most often queried over a long period of time in order to accurately make a decision And wouldnt the overhead of all this make the caching useless anywayp  pHow would you uniquely identify a query from another query or more accurately, a result set from another result set What about if youre using prepared statements, with only the parameters changing according to user inputp  pAnother poster said thisp  blockquote   pI would suggest using the md5 hash of   your query combined with a serialized   version of your input arguments.p blockquote  pIs the minuscule chance of collision worth worrying aboutp  pConceptually, caching in the Model seems like a good idea to me, but it seems in practicality and due to the nature of caching the developer should have direct control over it and explicity code it into the controller logic.p  hr  pstrongUpdate for Bountystrongp  pI am indeed using an extremely lightweight ORM somewhat similar to ActiveRecord but is capable of doing complex joins and subqueries without the coden2code problem. I built it myself, so it is flexible and isnt restrictive in terms of relations or column names, and I just want to understand how I should implement the caching mechanism.p  pFollowing the advice of the helpful people, I would take a hash probably md5 of the query concatenated with a list of its parameters, and use this as the key for that particular data store. Should I implement the caching individually in the Model classes that require it, or should it be part of the ORM layerp  pHow do I know when it should be invalidated Would I have to parse the UPDATEDELETEINSERT queries and sub in parameters manually to find out which records are being modified Or worse, do additional queries whenever data is modified to keep track of which things have changed and what should be invalidatedp  pI will award the bounty to whoever can give me a clear conceptual explanation whether or not this is really necessaryefficient to be done transparently, and if so, has some implementation details for the Model caching. I am using PHP and MySQL if that helps to narrow your focus.p

Negative 14012 pIm in the process of updating a tool that uses a Lucene index. As part of this update we are moving from Lucene 2.0.0 to 3.0.2. For the most part this has been entirely straightforward. However, in one instance I cant seem to find a straightforward conversion.p  pBasically I have a simple query and I need to iterate over emallem hits. In Lucene 2 this was simple, e.g.p  precodeHits hits  indexSearcher.searchquery forint i0  ilthits.length  i    Process hit  codepre  pIn Lucene 3 the API for codeIndexSearchercode has changed significantly and although I can bash together something that works, it is only by getting the top codeXcode documents and making sure that codeXcode is sufficiently large. p  pWhile the number of hits in my case is typically between zero and ten, there are anomalous situation where they could number much higher. Having a fixed limit therefor feels wrong. Furthermore, setting the limit really high causes OOME which means that space for all codeXcode possible hits is allocated immediately. As this operation is carried out emalotem, something reasonably efficient is desired.p  pstrongEditstrongp  pCurrently Ive got the following to workp  precodeTopDocs hits  indexSearcher.searchquery, MAXHITS for int i0  ilthits.totalHits  i      Process hit  codepre  pThis works fine except that p  pstrongastrong what if there are more hits then codeMAXHITScode p  pand p  pstrongbstrong if MAXHITS is large then Im wasting memory as room for each hit is allocated before the search is performed.p  pAs most of the time there will only be a few hits, I dont mind doing follow up searches to get the subsequent hits, but I cant seem to find a way to do that.p

Negative 14012 pIm in the process of building my first web application using ASP.NET MVC 2 and the Entity Framework. I am using the repository pattern. From information I have gathered on Stack Overflow and other websites it appears that the consensus is to have one one controller per domain model object and one repository per aggregate root object.p  pThe question I have is how I should be accessing nonroot aggregate objects through the aggregate root repository. In the example I am dealing with there is a Customer model and a Boat model. Boats can only exist with a FK reference to a Customer and Boats only need to be referenced within the context of a Customer. This led me to believe that I had an aggregate with these two objects and that the Customer was the root.p  pNow in my Boats controller I have an Edit action methodp  precodepublic class BoatsController  Controller      private ICustomersRepository customersRepository     public BoatsControllerICustomersRepository customersRepository              this.customersRepository  customersRepository             public JsonResult Editint id, FormCollection collection              var boat  customersRepository.GetBoatid          Update boat       codepre  pMy question is how do I want to retrieve the Boat object in the repositoryp  precodepublic class SQLCustomersRepository  ICustomersRepository      DatabaseEntities db  new DatabaseEntities      public Boat GetBoatint id              return db.Boats.SingleOrDefaultx gt x.ID  id           OR          return db.Customers.Wherex gt x.Boats.Anyy gt y.ID  id                            .Selectx gt x.Boats.FirstOrDefaulty gt y.ID  id       codepre  pIs it acceptable for me to reference db.Boats from the Customers Repository It seems to be the cleanest, but it would mean that I would have to alter my FakeCustomersRepository to have a List of Customers AND Boats.p  pIt seemed more reasonable to me to access the Boat through db.Customers, however I couldnt figure out how to return a single Boat object without repeating myself in the LINQ query which really didnt sit well with me.p  pI know I still have a lot to learn so hopefully you can point me in the right directionp  pThanksp

I chose the second option. However, i have some difficulties to connect between the global variable and my singleton pattern. how to i create the instance of timing in the Timing.cpp filebr i tried Timing timing  CreateInstance, however this doesnt work..br i cant create the instance in the main because then i will be implementing the first option..br do i need to write in main timing.CreateInstance br i hope i explained my self clearly. thanks for your helpp

Negative 14012 pIve been recruited to work on a form for tracking specimens.  Each specimen is associated with a subject each specimen also has a particular slot in a 9 x 9 storage box.  For ease of data entry, I think it would be best if the Access form mirrored the box itself and the paper forms that will be used to enter data into Access nine columns by nine rows, with each element consisting basically of a text box for the specimen ID.  This is basically how Id like it to lookp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comHr5ak.png altalt textp  pSo the data entry person would essentially type in the box number and specimen IDs, then click Create Records to pop all of those records into existence you can see some other stuff going on here, but thats not really important right now.  Im not really sure about the best way to code this, however.  Right now, the best process I can think of is to 1 run an insert query to create the box if it doesnt exist, 2 run an insert query to create the subject person, if it doesnt exist, and 3 run an insert query for each specimen, hardcoding in its row and column e.g. boxcol  A, boxrow  1.p  pNote the subject ID and specimen ID would both be parsed out of the ID field  its goofy, not my idea, but thats how its set up.  I can handle that, though.  p  pThis is a certainly a kludge, but Im not sure what else to do and most of what Ive googled up hasnt been pertinent to multiplerecord creation from a single form.  Is there a better way to do this  Should I simply abandon the idea and go with a more traditional bound subform approach  Id be very grateful for your insights and suggestions.  Thanks so much.p

Negative 14012 pThere are two primary methods of getting data onto a page when it comes to associating that data to markup using some kind of Repeater performing data binding in the markup DataBinder.Eval, etc. and overriding the OnItemDataBound event, finding the control on the page, and setting the value on the control in the code behind.

Negative 14012 pI am writing an iPad application which uses a menu from a popover to change the view displayed. I have a root view controller which is always present and changes its content view to the sub view controllers, e.g Home, News, etc...p  pNow heres the problem Lets say Im on the Home controller in portrait mode, then go to the news controller, then rotate to landscape, the root controller rotates fine and so does the news controller it contains. But when i go back to the home controller, it is still in portrait mode. The view is rotated to landscape orientation but its size is still in portrait so the width is still 768 px wide. The root view controller which presents all subcontrollers rotates correctly the content view does not rotate if it is not presentp  pHow do I fix this Im thinking something I could set in viewWillAppear but trying to set the interfaceOrientation forcefully does not work as it is readonly.p  pThanksp
Negative 14012 pWe have a project that was implemented in linq to sql and is being migrated to LLBLGenPro runtime using the adapter pattern.p  pThe first version of the app did a huge amount of caching, placing entire tables into the httpcache and then doing all the linking in the codebehind.  sighp  pSo you get something like p  precodefrom p in MyCacheObject.ProductPages join cmpp in MyCacheObject.ProductContentMemberships on p.ProductPageId equals cmpp.ProductContentId join pl in MyCacheObject.ProductPlans on cmpp.ProductLinkId equals pl.ProductPlanId                          codepre  pNow, in our new repository pattern, I can build such joins with prefetch paths.

Negative 14012 pZend Framework has a great component called ZendLocale.

Also there are languages   and regions which are not only   abbreviated with 2 characters.   Therefor you should NOT strip the   region and language yourself, but use   ZendLocale when you want to strip   language or region from a locale   string. Otherwise you could have   unexpected behaviour within your code   when you do this yourself.p blockquote  pPerfect. Except Ive been testing out various language translations. Assuming you browse with Firefox, change your settings and add some languageregion profiles...change the default order. Youll see that Zend only pulls the default. The docs even say sop  blockquote   pIf a user provides more than one   locale within his browser, ZendLocale   will use the first found locale. If   the user does not provide a locale or   the script is being called from the   command line the automatic locale   environment will automatically be   used and returned.p blockquote  pThis is unfortunate. If you have 5 languages defined, you want to go through all the locales the user defined in the browser and use a language that matches...p  pSo my question is, what approach would you take to parse the full list and pull out any matchesp  pstrongUPDATEstrong Theres a ZendLocalegetBrowser method which returns the full list. Great Not sure why ZendTranslate only seems to pull the first one then. Ill come back after checking how that works... will probably need to build the array of langs you have translations for and compare it to the results of getBrowser and pull the first match.p  pstrongUPDATE2strong I did implement a solution, but its still kind of hacky, because ZendTranslate and ZendLocale are not small little classes. Internationalization is a large topic, obviously. Theres a fair bit to research.p  pBut in essence it boils down to checking each language for matches against the browser preference list.p

Negative 14012 pWhen creating an interface having methods that are expected to be called in a specific order, is such dependency good practice, or should more patterns and practices be applied to fix it or make the situation betterp  pIts important users of some interfaces call methods in a specific order. p  pThere are likely many various examples. This is the one that came to mind firstp  pA data source interface of which the author envisions the init method to always be called first by any caller i.e to connect to the data source or look up preliminary meta info, etc, before any other of the operation methods are called.p  precodeinterface DataAccess        Note to callers this init must be called first and only once.     void InitSelf        operation get the record having the given id     T OpGetDataValueltTgtint id       operation get a cound     int OpGetCountOfData       operation persist something to the data store             void OpPersistobject o              etc.  codepre  pHowever the caller may choose not to call the initialization method first. p  pIn general Im wondering if there are better ways for this situation.p

Negative 14012 pThis is bothering me for longp  pWhen I raise my owns exceptions in my Python libraries, the exception stack shows the raiseline itself as the last item of the stack, this is obviously not an error, is conceptually right, but points the focus on some that is not useful for debug when your are using this code externally, for example as a module.p  pMy question is if there is something to avoid this, and force Python to show the previoustolast stack item as the last one, like the standard Python libraries.p  pThanks.p

Negative 14012 pWe are planning to write an API layer for our .net Winforms application. I have tried to google around for good examples for some best practises but didnt find much that could answer my questions. We current have the following structurep  pBusiness logic are in separate assemblies based on the business areas. So codeST.Invoice.Business.dllcode, codeST.Order.Business.dllcode and so on. Then we have codeST.Invoice.Bussiness.DC.dllcode, codeST.Order.Business.DC.dllcode and so on DC means data contracts which has all the interfaces. We have the same structure for the Data layer codeST.Invoice.Data.dllcode These assemblies are loaded through the Service Factory on run time and you can access them by going through codeServiceFactory.InvoiceBusinessService.GetInvoices...code. Now we need to exposes functionality to other 3rd party applications. If I were to give them all the functionality of let say invoices, can I just given the above assemblies relating to invoices or do I need to create another assembly say called codeST.Invoice.BusinessAPI.dllcode which would have pretty much the same public methods which then calls the methods in the codeST.Invoice.Business.dllcode to get the work donep  pI just need a guideline on how to write API and does it mean giving them our dlls to use our BI and talk to our DBp

Negative 14012 pIm trying to add line numbers to a JTextArea and am having some difficulties. The line numbers appear, but they do not scroll properly. p  pI have a linkedlist of a custom class that stores a line of data log message and a line number associated with it as well as visibility on whether it should be shown in the text area or not. So what I did was create two JTextAreas... one to store the logs, and the other to store the line numbers. p  pThe layout works and the line numbers populate correctly with the logs. The problem is when I try to scroll up or down. The logs adjust properly as you scroll, but the line numbers do not. Nothing shows beyond the initial 28 line numbers that are shown initially.

Negative 14012 pI would like to create an Android custom component for a game.  The basic idea is that the custom component would be square in shape and contain other square ImageView components inside it.  The ImageView components inside may be scaled andor cropped as needed, but must remain square.  The number of rows  columns, always.  The difficulty level determines the exact value of rows and columns at runtime.  As the game gets more difficult, the number of rows and columns will increase equally, but the scaled size of each ImageView will shrink accordingly.  I would like the components to have some fixed small spacing between them, mostly so it looks nice.  The display wont be scrollable, all items must fit on the display at the same time.  p  pAfter a bunch of failed attempts, Im getting frustrated and Im not sure what is the best approach is to make this custom component.  p  pMy latest idea would be to do roughly the following  p  pI create my custom component class by extends FrameLayout.  In my constructor, I create an arbitrary small square ImageView object in code.  Id like others to reuse my custom component someday, so I do it in code rather than XML so that the custom component doesnt rely on any external XML drawable having to be defined.  I set the scale type so that the ImageView retains its squareness I think I want fitStart.  I set the square ImageViews layoutwidth and layoutheight to fillparent, so the ImageView fills in as big a space as is available in the containing FrameLayout.  I add the now large and square ImageView to my layout using addView.  p  pNext I create a RelativeLayout object and also programmatically add it to myself using addView.  Because my base class is a FrameLayout, I think this will make the size of the RelativeLayout the same as the square ImageView previously added.  At least thats how I read the documentation.  p  pNext I measure the ImageView to see how large it is.  I dont think I can measure myself because my previous attempts failed at this.  I kept getting 0 for my size.  My research said this was because I cant measure myself during construction.  This turned into a Catch22.  When I tried to scale my image to the available space, I couldnt because there was no space available yet.  My hope is that because I changed to using the FrameLayout as my base class and I add the ImageView to it, I will be able to measure my newly created and correctly scaled large square ImageView.  p  pIf all goes as planned, I now know how big the space available is on the users device for my RelativeLayout because its the same as my ImageView.  By knowing how much space is available and how many rows and columns need to be displayed, I can correctly scale each ImageView I add accordingly, assuming I remember to account for the spacing between the ImageViews I add.  Now I no longer need the square ImageView and can make it go away if I want.  p  pIf reasonable, I would like the large ImageView to have rounded corners and each ImageView added also have rounded corners.  With a small gap between ImageViews added, this would look cool for gameplay.  This way I can leave it as a background.  p  pThis seems like a good solution, and better than my previous attempts that didnt work, but if theres a better way..., Im listening.  p  pHeres some psuedocode that says mostly the same thing as above to the best of my understandingp  pre construct      ImageView squareImageView  new ImageViewSquare     LayoutParams squareImageLayoutParams  new LayoutParamsLayoutParams.FILLPARENT, LayoutParams.FILLPARENT     squareImageLayoutParams.addRulefitStart     addViewsquareImageView, squareImageLayoutParams      RelativeLayout relativeLayout  new RelativeLayoutcontext     LayoutParams relativeLayoutParams  new LayoutParamsLayoutParams.FILLPARENT, LayoutParams.FILLPARENT     addViewrelativeLayout, relativeLayoutParams      int size  squareImageView.getWidth  Should be the scaled size and square.       squareImageView.setVisibilityINVISIBLE  maybe      loop for each row and col              crop, scale and add each image to the relativeLayout object.         pre  pMy most basic question is if this seems like a reasonable solution  If so, theres a bunch of things in the psuedocode I dont know how to do yet.  p  ul liHow do I create a small square ImageView in codeli liHow do I set the scaleType in codeli liWill I be able to measure my square ImageView and get the correct sizeli liIs there a better way to remove the square ImageView other than making it invisibleli liWill making my square ImageView invisible make it unmeasurable  li liI see something called a ShapeDrawable, would this be better than an ImageView for making a square  li liHow do I crop an ImageView to be square, distributing the loss equally to both sides  li ul  pI certainly dont expect anyone to know all these answers, but if you know any answers you can share, I would appreciate it.  p  pThanks.p

Negative 14012 pI have a user control which is used to display search results.

Negative 14012 pAfter dabbling in Chrome Extensions Ive noticed that when the data inside the Page Action gets to a certain point the scroll bars automatically attach themselves to the popup, this I expect.  However, instead of pushing the content to the left of the scroll bar it overlays the content causing a horizontal scrollbar to become active.  I ended up just adding a check on my data and applying a css class to push the content to the left more to run parallel to the scroll bar and beside it not under it.  What is the correct way to handle this besides my hackish solutionp

Negative 14012 pIve an existing stored procedure SP1 which is simple select from a table. Its being used at multiple places. p  pNow there is a new code which uses this SP1 along with an update statement in one serializable transaction. Im seeing deadlock where two transactions are able to acquire read lock on same set of rows and now want to convert that lock to update. p  pOne possible solution is to make this SP1 execute in read committed isolation level. strongBut I think this is not the right fix,strong as there can be lost updates. Another solution is to hint codeUPDLOCKcode in SP1s select statement. This will resolve the deadlock as whatever transaction acquires that UPDLOCK will only proceed. The other transaction will have to wait for this to commit.p  pNow adding codeUPDLOCKcode to this SP1 unnecessarly adds this overhead for other places which call SP1 but dont want codeUPDLOCKcode. So one might think to duplicate this SP1 and have new codeSP1UPDLOCKcode which is same as SP1 but with codeUPDLOCKcode. I dont want this duplication.

Make a codefillcode pointer a part of slide item class, assign the codefillcode object to the codefillcode pointer for those objects which support fill, and for rest of them keep it null.

Negative 14012 pI am developing an ASP.NET application in C.p  pI have two Database tables strongFoodId, Name, Descriptionstrong and strongFoodLogId, FoodId, FoodName, FoodDescription, ChangedFields, Datestrong. As the name indicates, strongFoodLogstrong stores the modification history made by the users to strongFoodstrong records and specifies in the strongChangedFieldsstrong field which fields have been modified compared with the previous version of the record.p  pTo display to the user a specific strongFoodstrong record I use the strongDetailsViewstrong control. When the user presses the strongUpdatestrong button an strongUpdateCommandstrong linked to the strongSQLDataSourcestrong is executed. This strongUpdateCommandstrong just modifies the corresponing Food record.p  pIn order to add a new record to the strongFoodLogstrong table I need to catch an event fired by the strongDetailsViewstrong upon update. When I catch this event I manually compare the record inserted by the user not yet committed to the DB with the one in the strongFoodstrong table matching its Id in order to keep track of the modified fields and store them in the strongChangeFieldsstrong field in the FoodLog table. Now in order to perform this task I can use two events fired by strongDetailsViewstrongp  ul lipstrongItemUpdatedstrong It is launched after the strongUpdateCommandstrong is executed. This way I lose track of the modified fields because the previous version of the record has been already overwritten.pli lipstrongItemUpdatingstrong It is launched before the strongUpdateCommandstrong is executed. This way I have still the old version of the record in the DB and I can make the comparison and then dtore in the FoodLog table. However if then the UpdateCommand fails for some reason I have a record in the log that do not correspond to a change on the Food table.pli ul  pAnybody might help with this problem Is it possible to write two different SQL expressions in the strongUpdateCommandstrongp  pThanksp

Negative 14012 pApples camera app seems to save video straight to the photos album. Im wondering if that capability can be accomplished by us mere mortal developers.p  pBoth methods Ive come across and tested, copy a video file to the photos album. The larger the file, the longer it takes to save. A 2 minute creation can vary in the save time. Two timings I have are, 45 seconds, and 1 minute 12 seconds to copy to copy files about 150MB in size. A file of similar size from the Apple Camera app can take as little as 6 seconds.p  pIve looked at the AVCam demo code and it uses one of the two methods Ive already tested.p  blockquoteALAssetsLibrary instance method writeVideoAtPathToSavedPhotosAlbumcompletionBlockblockquote  blockquoteUIKit Function UISaveVideoAtPathToSavedPhotosAlbumblockquote  pIm using AVFoundation to connect to the camera and open up a stream to a file.

Negative 14012 pnote This question is for some schoolwork Im doing. I dont need to know how to implement this, just need to know if its possible and how can I learn more about itp  pId like to use a user level buffer for a file using only a file descriptor and not using a FILE. I know codestdio.hcode has, at least, 1 fifo user level buffer for all codeprintfcode and codescanfcode functions.p  pMy questionp  pI was asked to do a system that uses the codewritecode linux function. That function is a system call. The objective here is to complete a small extra challenge I was given by the professor which is p  blockquote   pUse or make a user level buffer for the writting of those files.p blockquote  pBecause I use the function write and I use file descriptors I cannot use any of the codefprintfcode functions because it is documented that mixing system calls write and fprintf has an undefined result.p  pIs there an alternative way to use the same buffer as stdio or is there an equivalent buffer offered by linuxs libraries to write to that file Note I also need to know how to flush that bufferp  pI dont have special problems making a fifo buffer, but If I can save some work, thatll be useful.p  pNote My code is for linux. If there is portable code possible for this, please tell me about the portable code. If there isnt any portable code, then please give me linuxs way.p

Negative 14012 pI have a web application in which one of the workflows, users can download files that are dynamically generated. The input is a form which has parameters needed to generate the file. p  pMy current solution is to let them submit this form amp on the servlet side I change the response header  content disposition to be an attachment amp also provide an appropriate mimetype. p  pBut I find this approach to be inadequate. Because there are chances that the generation of file can take a very long time, in such cases after a certain timeout I directly get 500 or 503 errors in the browser. I guess this is to be expected for the current approach. p  pI want my workflow to be flexible enough to tell the users as soon as they submit the form that it might take time for the file to generate amp that we will display the link to the file as soon as it is ready.

Negative 14012 pI would like to know how to order efficiently in Rails. We all know that you can do simple ordering in Rails with the following methodsp  precode Model.ordercreatedat ASC.limit10 codepre  pIn this case Im just pulling the first 10 entries. If I wanted to add a nontime delineated ordering I could create a column in the Model eg customordering column and input values to order the objects. That case you would just modify the ordercustomordering ASC call.p  pBUT lets say I want to order based off a users predicted preference. In this case, its not feasible to create a new column because each user has different tastes. What would be a smart, efficient way to accomplish this taskp  pOne method would be to create an algorithm to predict a users rating of an object from Model called modelratingobject. This algorithm would spit out an positive integer value of their rating. If I went down this path, how would I efficiently order the Modelp  pAnother method would be to set the algorithm up as a modelentry.userpreferenceuser. Then I could order by p  precode Model.all.sort  b, a a.userpreferenceuser ltgt b.userpreferenceuser   codepre  pBut this strikes me as inefficient. It has to call all the entries in the model and then sort them which, even if you use efficient sorting methods like merge or bubble sort, gets poor performance on models with large numbers of entries.p  pAre there other paths I am not considering Can anyone point me in the right direction herep

Negative 14012 pI recently received a closedsource SDK consisting of a C header file code.hcode, a library file code.libcode, and a dynamic library code.dllcode. They were compiled using Microsofts Visual C. However, I am attempting to write my code using MinGW GCC ported to Windows, for anyone unfamiliar with the project. It appears that ld is unable to link to the code.libcode file. I was wondering if it was possible to write a compatibility wrapper between the VScompiled code and the GCC code Im writing.p

Negative 14012 pA project I am busy on now requires many different kinds of stats, most notably number of visitsviews to a product detail page for a specific period of time. This would of course require storing each visit in a table, e.g.p  pid  visitdate which will be a UNIXTIMESTAMP  productid  ipaddress for countryrelated statsp  pThis way stats can be generated per product and for a selected timeframe and using a DB like MaxMind GeoIP per citycountry as well.p  pOnly problem is this table will fill with millions and millions of records very quickly.

Negative 14012 pIve encountered this problem for a second time now, and Im wondering if there is any solution to this. Im running an application on Google App Engine that relies on frequent communication with a website through a hrefhttpsgithub.comThePiachuGoHTTPJSONRPCblobmastergaehttpjsonrpcgaehttpjsonrpcClient.go relnofollowHTTP JSON RPCa. It appears that GAE has a tendency to randomly display a message like this in the logsp  blockquote   pThis request caused a new process to be started for your application,   and thus caused your application code to be loaded for the first time.   This request may thus take longer and use more CPU than a typical   request for your application.p blockquote  pAnd reset all variables stored in RAM without warning. The same process happens over and over no matter how many times I set the variables again or upload newer code to GAE, although incrementing the app version number seems to solve the problem.p  pHow can I get more information on this behaviour, how to avoid it and prevent data loss of my Golang applications on Google App Enginep  pEDITp  pThe variables stored in RAM are small classes of strings, bytes, bools and pointers. Nothing too complicated or big.p  pGoogle App Engine seems to start a new process in matter of seconds of heavier use, which shouldnt be long enough time for the application to be shut down for not being used. The timespan between application being uploaded to GAE, having its variable set and a new process being created is less than a minute.p

Negative 14012 pI am using ObjectContext.ExecuteStoreQuery to return a list of entities, about 30K.p  pI need to improve performance so I will be selecting 4 properties that I really need, instead of the total 20 properties.p  pI could create a DTO with these 4 properties and pass it to ObjectContext.ExecuteStoreQuery, but I would prefer to use a DataReader, iterate over the 30K, and build my list.p  pI tried both options and it seems they take the same time did not measure it. My question is does ObjectContext.ExecuteStoreQuery iterate over the result set, as I am doing manually with a DataReaderp  pI found this in MSDN, but does not really answer my question. Thank you.p  blockquote   pCalling the ExecuteStoreQuery method is equivalent to calling the   ExecuteReader method of the DbCommand class, only ExecuteStoreQuery   returns entities and the ExecuteReader returns property values in the   DbDataReader.p blockquote
Negative 14012 pI was wondering where I could find some nice resource material on how I could write some clean collision detection coding.p  pIm pretty new to XNA programming, and have a general understanding on how I would want to write my game, but I am having serious trouble with the idea of collision detection.

Negative 14012 pI know this is rather a trivial question but anyhow I want to know if it is solvable.p  pI have an ASP.NET webform page with a nested masterpage and JavaScript includes. I make extensive use of jQuery and Ajax calls. Once a page is loaded, all communication with the server is done with Ajax calls, so I dont need ViewState enabled, and this is resulting in a reduced HTML output code.p  pI now have to implement a page where a user can upload a file. So I used the AsyncFileUpload control of AjaxToolkitFileUpload. Once a file is uploaded, I do a Ajax call to the server to request the filename.p  pIt all works fine but I noticed that FireBug found 10 errors per file upload between the OnClientUploadStarted and the OnClientUploadComplete events. The file is uploaded properly and the events on the client side are working too. But I cant ignore the fact that there are errors thrown so I went looking for the problem.p  pI rebuild the page piece by piece and I found out that this control needs the Viewstate enabled. However with emviewstatedisabledem in the page directive the file size is 76.6kb, and with emviewstateenabledem the size is 99.2kb. p  pAgain, I know it is trivial and will not affect performance on the site, but it is a nice to know. br  Why does this control needs the viewstate I suppose because it actually post the file to a iFrame or something like thatbr  How can I reduce the viewstate and let this control still work properly  p

Negative 14012 pI have been trying to incorporate the Windows 7 taskbar APIs in a regular MFC MDI multiple document interface application. I am using Visual Studio 2008 where I have redirected the SDK path to use the Windows 7 SDK. p  pThe idea is to provide custom live preview bitmaps for each of the childframe windows that gets created inside the application. Though I have been able to make progress, there is a bit of struggle that I am going through with the final bits and pieces which do not seem to go right.Just wanted to know if I am missing anything.p  pOk, p  ol lipso we need a proxy window, which I have as the live preview APIs work only on top level windows this is a disappointment. This window handles the WMDWMSENDICONICTHUMBNAIL and WMDWMSENDICONICLIVEPREVIEWBITMAP which provide the APIs with the required bitmaps for thumbnail preview and live preview.p  precodecase  WMDWMSENDICONICTHUMBNAIL      get the bitmap of the client window      set it as thumbnail          width  HIWORDlParam         height  LOWORDlParam         hBitmap  CreateBitmapFromHandleAndResizehwnd, width, height         if hBitmap                      SetThumbnailhBitmap, hwnd             DeleteObjecthBitmap              break case WMDWMSENDICONICLIVEPREVIEWBITMAP         hBitmap  CreateBitmapFromHandlehwnd         if hBitmap                      SetThumbnailForPreviewhBitmap, hwnd             DeleteObjecthBitmap                  break codepreli lipBoth the functions CreateBitmapFromHandleAndResize and CreateBitmapFromHandle create a DIB aka device independent bitmap which are food for the APIs DwmSetIconicThumbnail and DwmSetIconicLivePreviewBitmap. pli ol  pProblem faced The problem I am facing is in the live preview bitmap area where the following code does the work. The hBitmap is a 32 bit depth DIB which when saved on the disk seems to be a proper screenshot of the child window that I would like to display. But when I preview it, somehow the title bar and the bitmap doesnt seem to be of the same quality as of the window itself. In fact it looks like an out of focus representation of the child window. I would like to have the same quality image displayed because the user should not feel the difference.p  pCurrently I take the print of the entire window including the frame and position the live preview exactly on top of the existing window so that when the live preview is on, the user is deceived to see the bitmaps instead of actual child windows. p  pI hope this is the expected behaviour here of live preview. Please let me know if I am wrong here.p  pOne other problem was the offset. Not sure whether I am doing something wrong here. But it simply does not work when I just do a diff of the two rects. The correction factor of 8 and 14 was done with a trial and error methodp  precode    void SetThumbnailForPreviewHBITMAP hBitmap, HWND hWnd           StateInfo pState  StateInfo GetWindowLongPtrhWnd, GWLPUSERDATA           CWnd pMainFrame  pStategtmpParentWndgtGetParent           pStategtpTaskBargtSetTabActivehWnd, pMainFramegtGetSafeHwnd, 0           RECT rectClient, rectMainframe          pStategtmpParentWndgtGetClientRectamprectClient          pStategtmpParentWndgtClientToScreenamprectClient           pMainFramegtGetWindowRectamprectMainframe           POINT offset          offset.x  rectClient.left  rectMainframe.left  8          offset.y  rectClient.top  rectMainframe.top  14           HRESULT hr  DwmSetIconicLivePreviewBitmaphWnd, hBitmap, ampoffset, 0         codepre  pMy questions in a nutshellp  ol lipIs there anyway to get the bitmap being displayed with the same quality as that of the window itself so that no difference is being felt.pli lipIs the offset calculation correct. Why does it not work with straightforward RECT diffspli lipWhether my understanding is correct with respect to the behaviour of live preview in an MDI appp  pstrongIn the thumbnail preview areastrong The the MDI main window is always displayed along with the other thumbnails. Thebr thumbnail images are individual representations of the child windows. p  pstrongIn the live preview areastrong If you hover over individual thumbnails, the live preview always displays the MDI mainbr frame along with the child windows.

I have a common class codeTGLItemcode which is used to create a number of inheritance classes. For example, codeTGLCarcode is inherited from codeTGLItemcode and is added to the list codeTGLItemscode. This custom list class is part of the control.p  pWhen the control draws, it does a loop through this item list and calls the codeDrawcode procedure of each item. codeDrawcode is intended to be overridden by the inheritance classes where the actual drawing of the item occurs. So the real work is done from the codeDrawcode procedure which is implemented in the codeTGLCarcode class but it is only called from the main control.p  pThe main control codeTGLImagecode shall have no knowledge of what the actual inherited item is, but be able to call its codeDrawcode procedure expecting it to draw to OpenGL.p  pHow do I structure this item list and item base in a way to accommodate for this scenario Heres what I have so farp  precode  TGLItems  classTPersistent   private     FItems TList     function GetItemIndex Integer TGLItem     procedure SetItemIndex Integer const Value TGLItem   public     constructor Create     destructor Destroy override     procedure AddAItem TGLItem     function Count Integer     property Items[Index Integer] TGLItem read GetItem write SetItem default   end    TGLItem  classTPersistent   private     FPosition TGLPosition     FDimensions TGLDimensions     FOwner TGLItems     FItemClass TGLItemClass     procedure PositionChangedSender TObject     procedure DimensionsChangedSender TObject     procedure SetPositionconst Value TGLPosition     procedure SetDimensionsconst Value TGLDimensions   public     constructor CreateOwner TGLItems     destructor Destroy override     procedure Draw     property Owner TGLItems read FOwner     property ItemClass TGLItemClass read FItemClass   published     property Position TGLPosition read FPosition write SetPosition     property Dimensions TGLDimensions read FDimensions write SetDimensions   end codepre  pimplementation...p  precode TGLItem   constructor TGLItem.Create begin   FPosition TGLPosition.Create   FPosition.OnChange PositionChanged   FDimensions TGLDimensions.Create   FDimensions.OnChange DimensionsChanged end  destructor TGLItem.Destroy begin   FPosition.Free   FDimensions.Free   inherited end  procedure TGLItem.DimensionsChangedSender TObject begin  end  procedure TGLItem.Draw begin   Draw to gl scene  end  procedure TGLItem.PositionChangedSender TObject begin  end  procedure TGLItem.SetDimensionsconst Value TGLDimensions begin   FDimensions.AssignValue end  procedure TGLItem.SetPositionconst Value TGLPosition begin   FPosition.AssignValue end   TGLItems   procedure TGLItems.AddAItem TGLItem begin   FItems.AddAItem   Expects objects to be created and maintained elsewhere   This list object will not createdestroy any items end  function TGLItems.Count Integer begin   Result FItems.Count end  constructor TGLItems.Create begin   FItems TList.Create end  destructor TGLItems.Destroy begin   FItems.Free   inherited end  function TGLItems.GetItemIndex Integer TGLItem begin   Result TGLItemFItems[Index] end  procedure TGLItems.SetItemIndex Integer const Value TGLItem begin   TGLItemFItems[Index].AssignValue end codepre  pThe OpenGL part of it isnt necessarily relevant in this scenario, I just wanted to explain a little detail of what this is intended for to have an idea of how I expect this to work.p  pI also have the idea of passing the codeTGLItemscode list object to each individual item in its constructor, and having each item register its self in the item list. In this case, the item list wouldnt have any add procedure, and I probably wouldnt even need a separate list object. Im just sure there should be some big trick to this that Im missing, and Im open to any large scale changes to the structure to more efficiently accommodate for this.p

Negative 14012 pI used EF fluent API for mapping my POCO classes to database tables. I need to use the mapping configuration in my own application logic.

If I had used the data annotation attributes I could find my key property using reflection. My question is that is it basically possible achive the same when I define my mappings with fluent APIp  hr  pThanks diaho. I exactly came to the solution that you suggest but still it is not a good solution since entity framework does not allow us to make query using a field which is not pure entity field. Take the following example I want to write a generic method which return an entity based on its id. I came to the following solutionp  precodepublic TModel GetByIdltTModel, TKeygtTKey id where TModel  ModelBaseltTKeygt      return context.SetltTModelgt.wheree gt e.Id  id.FirstOrDefault  codepre  pThis code however doesnt work since entity framework complains that codee.Idcode is not a field of drived entity class its a field of parent class. Of course its possible to hack this issue by converting codeSetltTModelgtcode to list as follow to force executing query earlier. But this is terrible in terms of performance since it load all entities to memory to retrieve a single one. p  precodepublic TModel GetByIdltTModel, TKeygtTKey id where TModel  ModelBaseltTKeygt      return context.SetltTModelgt.ToList.wheree gt e.Id  id.FirstOrDefault  codepre  pDo you have better suggestion for this scenariop

Negative 14012 pIs it possible to change the conflict markers to something user definedp  pstrongMotivationstrongp  pIt has happened several times to me that, due to hasty and not very careful merging of several branches, there are some left over merge tags in my LaTeX document. With most programming projects these tags would result in an syntax error and therefore I would spot them. However, in Latex the ltltltlt,  and  tags are just compiled into some other character sequences without any warning.p  pTo remedy this I would like to change these conflict markers into something that doesnt compile, or at leasts make them very obvious to spot e.g. page breaks, huge font warnings, or compile warnings. p  pI could of course make a bash script that replaces all those markers by something of my choice, but I would prefer it a more elegant solution to this problem.p  pP.S. Ive found the merge.conflictstyle option, but the diff3 option only adds the  marker which also compiles without warning.p
Negative 14012 pWell, I have developed a java application using several objects relationships that make the memory usage too expensive.

Negative 14012 pa hrefhttpsgithub.comosinkasubset relnofollowSubseta looks like an interesting, thin MongoDB wrapper.p  pIn one of the examples given, there are Tweets and Users. However, codeUsercode is a emsubdocumentem of codeTweetcode. In  classical SQL, this would be normalized into two separate tables with a foreign key from Tweet to User. In MongoDB, this wouldnt necessitate a codeDBRefcode, storing the users codeObjectIdcode would be sufficient.p  pBoth in Subset and Salat this would result in these case classesp  precodecase class Tweetid ObjectId, content String, userId ObjectId case class Userid ObjectId, name String codepre  pSo theres no guarantee that the ObjectId in Tweet actually resolves to a User making it less typesafe.

Is this possible, and if so, how What are good alternativesp

Negative 14012 pI am using Django Celery with a RabbitMQ backend, all hosted on Heroku.p  pFrom the Celery docs, it is clear that Celery is designed to create new queues for tasks.  My problem is, when I go into my RabbitMQ console, I see that only the default queue has any consumers celeryd instances hooked up to it.  The result is, all the tasks on the nondefault queues never run.  p  pSince the Celery docs explicitly state that Celery is supposed to create many queues, I feel like I must be missing something very basic here with my config.  Nonetheless, I cant get my consumers to jump around and look for non empty queues  they just stay on the empty default queue.  p  pAny ideas on how to solve this problemp  pThanksp

Negative 14012 pUsing Microsoft Unit Test Wizard, it creates Accessor objects if you need to test a nonpublic property in another project. Inside my Unit Tests I create helper functions so that I dont repeat the same code just in every Unit Test method. Currently I have two tests that are almost identical except one takes a standard object, and the other takes the Accessor version. Since the Accessor is based on the standard version I should be able to have one function and I assume I should be able to use Generics to accomplish.

Negative 14012 pI am evaluating ReactiveExtensions and ReactiveUI for my current project. Both look very promising. However, I just ran into following problem. I have a type called RecordSet that defines a read only property of ReactiveCollectionltMyRecordTypegt called Records. I need to manipulate some properties of every record item to be added to the collection as well as other items that are already in the collection right before the new item is added to the collection. Some of the manipulations are based on total count of the items that are already in the collection but not including the item to be added. I was trying observing records.BeforeItemsAdded but for some reason OnNext callbacks invoked too late after items count in the collection already equals to the total number or items that are eventually added to the collection. What is recommended Rx pattern for attacking problem like this p

To do this, I just need to give those Buttons more width and height so they will be easier to click.p  pMy problem comes when I see that those Buttons are using background to store the image and so, whenever I make them bigger so does the image inside.p  pMy question is, am I stuck with having to create a layout on top of it, assign the listener to this new, bigger layout, and then leaving the button as an image, or is there any easier wayp  precode                                              lt outter layout                                                                                                                 BUTTON       gt        BUTTON                                                                                                                                             codepre  pThanksp

Negative 14012 pTo check my visitors site usage I use PHP session variables and cookies. But I found out a problematic. When a Twitter for iPhone user visits my site, that application stores my cookies successfully. But I cant check for session variables.  p  pI cant check it because I have no iPhone device. Does this application makes PHP to create  different session IDs in every request  p  pWhen the same user visits my site from Safari, everything is fine again. But it seems like that application also serves web pages inside.p  pEdit Of course sessions are stored inside server. But all my sessionscookies works well except the users that uses Twitter for iPhone. I cant find the the session for the user, whom came to my website even 30 seconds ago. That thoughts me that source of the problem can be that application.p  pEdit I found out that same issue happens also in Twitter for iPad visitors.p
Negative 14012 pI need help with the SELECT statement in an application that I will call appUpdateUsers. This application is designed to update records in a Users table. The application code makes reference to the following tables  p  ul liStates  li liCountiesli liOrganizationsli liUsersli ul  pThe States table contains a list of all 50 US states. The Counties table contains a list of the 58 counties in the state of California. The Organization table contains a list of organizations that may be located in any state and that provide services in one or more California counties. When adding or updating a User record, I want to filter the list of Organizations based on the state in which they are located and the county or counties in which they provide services.p  pThe application has three selecttype statements to create picklists of attributes in a Users record. I have written code that works for the first two statements, but I am having problems with the code for the third statement. The fields referenced by these statements are    uState   uCounty   uOrganizationp  pThe statements for the uState and uCounty fields invoke onChange Ajax processing to update the selections on the picklist for the uOrganization field. The options for the picklists for first two fields are selected with the following codep  pFor the uState fieldp  precodeSELECT stAbbr, CONCATstAbbr,   , stStatePK    FROM States     ORDER BY stAbbr codepre  pFor the uCounty fieldp  precodeSELECT cCounty, cCounty     FROM Counties     ORDER BY cCounty codepre  pThe records in the Organizations table can have multiple counties listed in the oCounties field because an organization can operate in multiple counties. Therefore the options for the picklist for the uOrganization field are currently selected with the following code p  precodeSELECT oName    FROM Organizations     WHERE oCounties LIKE uCounty     ORDER BY oName ASC    codepre  pI can also select records in the Organizations table based on the state in which they are located with the following code p  precodeSELECT oName, oName    FROM Organizations     WHERE oState  uState     ORDER BY oName ASC  codepre  pHowever, the logic that I want to use for selecting the options for the uOrganization field would combine these two code snippets. In plain English, it would go something like this If the uState field is set to California, then select records from the Organizations table based on the value in the uCounty field. IF the uState field is not set to California, then select records from the Organizations table based on the value in the uState field. p  pThe following IF . . . THEN . . . ELSE syntax gets the point across, but it doesnt workp  precodeIF uState  CA THEN    SELECT oName, oName    FROM Organizations     WHERE oCounties LIKE uCounty     ORDER BY oName ASC    ELSE    SELECT oName, oName    FROM Organizations     WHERE oState  uState     ORDER BY oName ASC  ENDIF codepre  pWhat is the correct way to write this code p

On the first startup of the solution, or if I remove the .suo file, the conditional references are not processed and the solutions fails to build. My condition is this onep  precodeltChoosegt ltWhen Condition ConfigurationDebugUsingDLL or ConfigurationReleaseUsingDLL gt   ltItemGroupgt   ltProjectReferencegt...ltProjectReferencegt   ltItemGroupgt ltWhengt ltChoosegt codepre  pI understand that the selected Configuration is stored in the .suo file, which is why this works fine as long as the .suo exists on the disk.  p  pHowever, because we are using solutions to automate our builds , we always check out the source in a new folder, but the .suo file must not be check in because it is user dependent.  p  pTo better understand, we use four configurations Debug Release DebugUsingDLL and ReleaseUsingDLL, and we have different projects for DLLs and for static libraries thus the references must change based on that.br I tried to only have DebugUsingDLL and ReleaseUsingDLL in the solution, which would mean the test should always yield true for this solution, but the reference are not processed correctly either.p  pCan you confirm this looks like a bug in the IDE  Can you suggest an alternative p

Negative 14012 pMy db keeps the top 10 records.  When the db is empty, the db records the scores and inserts them correctly all the way until there is 10 records.  Then, for example, when the db has 10 scores, and the user gets a score that should be the new 1 score, it just replaces the current 1 score with the new one instead of inserting and bumping everything below it down one and deleting the bottom score.  Hopefully I explained that well but if not just comment and I will try to clarify further.p  pMy question is how can I get the high scores to perform correctly as in when the high scores is full with 10 records already, a new record is inserted into the correct spot and the rest below it are all moved down one with the last record getting bumped off completely since it is the new 11.p  pstrongDatabaseHelper.javastrongp  precodepublic class DatabaseHelper extends SQLiteOpenHelper        SQLiteDatabase db      private static final int DATABASEVERSION  6      private static final String DBNAME  test3      private static final String DBPATH  datadatamatt.lyons.bibletriviadatabases     private static final String TABLE  HighscoresList        Table columns names.      private static final String RANK  id      private static final String SCORE  score      private static final String PERCENTAGE  percentage     private static final String TOTALSCORE  totalscore     private static final String CATEGORY  category      Constructor for a DatabaseHelper.     public DatabaseHelperContext context           supercontext, DBNAME, null, DATABASEVERSION            Open the DB so it is editable.     public SQLiteDatabase openDB          db  this.getWritableDatabase         return db           Delete a selected one row.     public void deletelong lowScore          lowScore  getLowest         db.deleteTABLE, TOTALSCORE    lowScore, null           Sort rows in order of the TOTALSCORE column.     public long getLowest          Cursor c  db.rawQuerySELECT  FROM   TABLE   ORDER BY   TOTALSCORE, null         long count  c.getCount         long lowScore  1         ifcount  10              c.moveToLast             lowScore  c.getIntc.getColumnIndexTOTALSCORE                  return lowScore           Calculate the TOTALSCORE based on the SCORE and PERCENTAGE of a game.     public long calculateTotalScorelong score, int percentage          long i         return i  percentage  1000  score           Check if new record makes the top 10.     public long checklong score, int percentage, long sum          Cursor c  db.rawQuerySELECT   TOTALSCORE   FROM   TABLE, null         long count  c.getCount         long lowscore         ifcount  10              c.moveToLast             lowscore  c.getIntc.getColumnIndexTOTALSCORE             return lowscore          else              return count                    Insert new record.     public long insertlong score, int percentage, long totalscore, String category          ContentValues values  new ContentValues         values.putSCORE, score         values.putPERCENTAGE, percentage         values.putTOTALSCORE, totalscore         values.putCATEGORY, category          return db.insertTABLE, null, values           Create the table and all columns.     public void onCreateSQLiteDatabase db          db.execSQLCREATE TABLE   TABLE                     RANK   INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,                  SCORE   LONG,                  PERCENTAGE   INTEGER,                  CATEGORY   STRING,                  TOTALSCORE   LONG                         codepre  pstrongResults.javastrongp  precodepublic class Results extends Activity       DatabaseHelper dh      public void onCreateBundle savedInstanceState           dh  new DatabaseHelperthis         dh.openDB         showResults           public void showResults           totalscore  dh.calculateTotalScorescore, percentage         ifdh.getLowest  1              dh.insertscore, percentage, totalscore, category          else              dh.deletedh.getLowest             dh.insertscore, percentage, totalscore, category                codepre

Negative 14012 pIm working on a benchmark tool which among other things measures the time and memory used by an external process performing an operation. Im mostly interested in the peak pageable memory size a.k.a. PageFileBytesPeak performance counter  Process.PeakPagedMemorySize64  peak private bytes. This is a .NET project so a pure .NET solution would be preferable, however this is most likely not a possibility.p  pThe problem here is that I wont know the peak memory usage before the process has exited. I cant read the performance counters for the process when it no longer exists. So I could instead poll it while the process is running.p  pHowever this is not preferable as if I poll too often I will interfere with the time it takes for the process to complete its work, and if poll too rarely the result wont be accurate the process will most likely hit its peak memory usage right before it exits. So Im hoping there is some way to do it reliably that is less hacky than the solutions I have come up with so farp  ol liInject DLL into process, report value via IPC mechanism on DLLPROCESSDETACH.li liPatchHook ExitProcess in target process, report value via IPC mechanism before executing real ExitProcess.li liPretend to be a debugger, measure value on EXITPROCESSDEBUGEVENT the process wont be cleaned up by the kernel before ContinueDebugEvent is called.li ol

Negative 14012 pI want to display a strong.docxstrong file in a codeViewcode in Android. The file has mathematical symbols and also images in between the text. I want to display many such files and flip through them via codeswipecode gesture. I have successfully done the same for strong.txtstrong files. And can now very easily go to the next page on swipe. The code for strong.txtstrong file is as followsp  precodepublic String readTxtString fileName                try              InputStream is             is  context.getAssets.openfileName  .txt             ByteArrayOutputStream byteArrayOutputStream  new ByteArrayOutputStream              int i             i  is.read             while i  1                              byteArrayOutputStream.writei                 i  is.read                           is.close              return byteArrayOutputStream.toString                     catch IOException e                       e.printStackTrace                   return fileName      codepre  pThis code returns the text which I then display in my codeTextViewcode. This way I only need to change the name of the file dynamically and on swipe the Text changes.p  pNow I want to modify this code so that I can display MS Word files.docx which contain text,images and mathematical symbols.p  pI have already checked many similar threads on this topic on stack overflow as well as on other forums  These are the links many people have suggested as answers to similar questions and I have already given these a try a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions12816281howtoreaddocandexcelfileinandroidLink1a and a hrefhttpwww.chrisumbel.comarticleandroidtextviewrichtextspannablestringlink2a p  pAlso on many other threads people have recommended strongJopendocumentstrong. I have also read about that and learnt that Android does not support open document format. so that option seems unlikely. But if you have any workaround or a good detailed explanation with respect to adding the JOpenDocument library to the project and displaying rich text then please share that solution because I have searched for it a lot but couldnt find any. p  pThere is also another library called strongOliveDocLibrarystrong to display rich word files on android. here is the a hrefhttpscode.google.compandroidofficedemodownloadslistlinka from where I downloaded the lib. The demo included in that download package works just fine.But the lib is a trial version. So am currently trying to work with this library and see where it goes. But am still in search of better options.p  pAny help regarding this is appreciated. Any pointers other than the ones mentioned above are most welcome.p  pstrongUpdatestrongp  pI got a suggestion which told the use of strongApache POIstrongHWPF more specifically in the first bounty I started on this question. After exploring Apache POI for some time, I got few codes which were writing into a doc file, reading the doc file, updating the excel sheets etc.p  pSuch Sample codefor Java which I found off the internet goes something like thisp  precodeimport java.io. import org.apache.poi.hwpf.HWPFDocument import org.apache.poi.hwpf.extractor.WordExtractor  public class ReadDocFile  public static void mainString[] args  File file  null WordExtractor extractor  null  try   file  new FilecNew.doc FileInputStream fisnew FileInputStreamfile.getAbsolutePath HWPFDocument documentnew HWPFDocumentfis extractor  new WordExtractordocument String [] fileData  extractor.getParagraphText forint i0iltfileData.lengthi iffileData[i]  null System.out.printlnfileData[i]   catchException exep   codepre  pSo I added this libraryApache POI to my Android project in eclipse and tried this sample code with some changes. And tried displaying it on a codeTextViewcode. The problem here though is it doesnt display the images like strongOliveDocLibrarystrong does. So if Someone is going to suggest Apache POI, then I request for a solid pointer or a code which reads a strongdocxstrong file and strongallstrong its contentsthat includes images and displays them in a custom view.p  pstrongApache POIstrong is a great thing but sadly I didnt find any good examplessamples implementing those libraries. If you know a good source of examplesw.r.t MS word only then please share them in comments. p  pstrongUpdate 2strongp  pIn strongOliveDocLibrarystrong package the code provided works fine. There is water mark of Olive on the View though. Currently am working on performing codeSwipecode on that code. But the problem remains that its a trial version.p  pstrongUpdate 3strongp  pI think strongOliveDocLibrarystrong is the most efficient way to do it. Though it has a disadvantage of being a trial version, I think no other library does a better job than this library to full fill my specific requirement. The detailed answer has been posted a hrefhttpstackoverflow.coma160532092021499belowa. As the bounty time is about to get over. I would request the people who may have an alternate and better solution to post it as soon as possible. For now am going with strongOliveDocLibrarystrong and accepting my own answer.p

Negative 14012 pI have some troubles with CATextLayer, that could be due to me, but I didnt find any help on this topic. I am on OS X on iOS it should be the same.p  pI create a CATextLayer layers with scale factor  1 and what I get is a blurred text. The layer is rasterized before applying the scale, I think. Is this the expected behavior I hope it is not, because it just makes no sense... A CAShapeLayer is rasterized after that its transformation matrix is applied, why the CATextLayer should be differentp  pIn case I am doing something wrong... what is itp  precodeCATextLayer layer  [CATextLayer layer] layer.string  I like what I am doing layer.font  bridge CFTypeRef[NSFont systemFontOfSize24] layer.fontSize  24 layer.anchorPoint  CGPointZero layer.frame  CGRectMake0, 0, 400, 100 layer.foregroundColor  [NSColor blackColor].CGColor layer.transform  CATransform3DMakeScale2., 2., 1. layer.shouldRasterize  NO [self.layer addSublayerlayer] codepre  pThe solution I use at the moment is to set the contentsScale property of the layer to the scale factor. The problem is that this solution doesnt scale if the scale factor of any of the parent layers changes, then contentsScale should be updated too. I should write code to traverse the layers tree to update the contentsScale properties of all CATextLayers... not exactly what I would like to do.p  pAnother solution, that is not really a solution, is to convert the text to a shape and use a CAShapeLayer. But then I dont see the point of having CATextLayers.p  pA custom subclass of CALayer could help in solving this problemp  pEDIT Even CAGradientLayer is able to render its contents, like CAShapeLayer, after that its transformation matrix is applied. Can someone explain how it is possiblep  pEDIT 2 My guess is that paths and gradients are rendered as OpenGL display lists, so they are rasterized at the actual size on the screen by OpenGL itself. Texts are rasterized by Core Animation, so they are bitmaps for OpenGL.p  pI think that I will go with the contentsScale solution for the moment. Maybe, in the future, I will convert texts to shapes.

Negative 14012 pI have an installation of Magento that integrates with Wordpress using the Fishpig Wordpress module. p  pAs most WP users will know, when uploading an image Wordpress will create resized versions referencing the dimensions set in Media Settings e.g. Thumbnail Size, Medium Size and Large Size. It also creates images for each custom thumbnail size you specify e.g. via functions.php.  p  pIt appears as though the Fishpig Magento module only uses the Thumbnail image size.p  pUnfortunately I need to be able to display different sizes of the same image i.e. the resized versions that Wordpress creates on different pages. For example, the category page will display a small version, the post view page will display a larger version. p  pI was wondering if anyone has had any experience retrieving the other resized images via this module as I cant find much documentation on it or if its even possible with this module as I also couldnt see any code that would suggest this functionality.p  pGreatly appreciate the help.p

Negative 14012 pIve seen a number of older questions on this but Im wondering if there is a more recent problem. Earlier this year I rebuilt my Ubuntu box, installed the GH system 7.6.2, and GNU Emacs 24.2.1. Ive recently had some time to return to Haskell but my environment is not working nearly as well as it did on my previous machine... On my previous system the Flymake module worked wonderfully in this environment. Now it seems to only be partly functional. It no longer highlights warnings and errors, autosaves and recompiles, etc. It will give some tooltip type information when I hover the mouse over a pointer, and it attempts to help with indentation, though it gets confused as often or not. p  pHas anyone else experienced problems with recent versions Any suggestions on how to repair p

When I fastclick them, its like the area covered by the ul element is flashing in grey for a millisecond, showing the area being covered.p  pIm not sure what could cause this.

Negative 14012 pJNDI LDAP auth requires a cleartext password to be passed Context.SECURITYCREDENTIALS to almost all security mechanisms or at least how I understand it. It looks like to be designed in a way, that the password originates from the current JVM. But what about a password, that has to be sent from another machine This approach forces it to be sent in a recoverable fashion the most simple is cleartext with little security.p  pTo be more specific, lets consider a 3tier setup client, java server and an LDAP server. The user enters the username and password in the client which is sent to the java server. Then the java server communicates with an LDAP server in order to authorize these credentials. Is there a way to make the transmission from the client to the java server secure I understand, that we can use SSL or another way to secure the channel itself, but its still no good that we have to send the password in a recoverable fashion through this even secure channel.p  pI tried to search for an answer, but it looks like most of them consider a 2tier setup. There were also some 3d party java libraries recommendations instead of JNDI, but it wasnt clear, if that they can handle my task. If they actually do so, could you please give an example utilizing them for my taskp  pMy target platforms are Delphi XE3 Client, Java SE 6 Server and an AD LDAP. But Im also interested in a more theoretical discussion not restricted to these concrete client and LDAP.p

So most of what i need works. It took me a while to figure out how to get it to use the previous answer as the first number again, but then came another problem. After it prints out the first answer, it goes straight to asking for the second number again instead of letting the user select another operator. What i tried was having a continue statement, but then it will just keep going back to asking for an operator and not let the user do a second problem. I also tried doing two separate if statements instead of just the one you see above, but that doesnt work either. Im not one that wants someone to necessarily fix this for me. I want to understand what happens and know how it works. If anyone could lend me a hand, i would greatly appreciate it. p

There is then a method to split a string called text into an array of string using Regex.Split. So far all good.  Next there is a foreach loop which loops through the array, but the next part trips me up, it is checking if frequencies contains the particular word, if it does then increase the value of it by 1 or if it doesnt yet have a value set it to 1. But how does the dictionary get populated with the word key in the first place to allow it to be checkedp  pIt looks to happen in this linep  precodefrequencies[word]  1 codepre  pBut I cant find a reference anywhere that says specifying a dictionary object followed by square brackets and an assignment to a value also populates the key.

Negative 14012 pI am trying to make a webapp that will load a page from a remote server, but allow the user to play audio from files that are on their local drive not downloaded from the remote server.

Negative 14012 pI debug django application and want to suspend code execution at the point where exception occurs with cursor pointing to problematic place in code. Pretty HTML display by django would be helpful either but not mandatory. My IDE is PyCharm.p  pIf I set pycharm to suspend on termination of exception, then I never catch it, because django handles the exception with HTML debug info and exceptions never terminate. Setting DEBUGPROPAGATEEXCEPTIONS  True inside settings.py causes HTML debug info to disappear but the execution does not terminate either.p  pIf I set pycharm to suspend on raise of exception, then I have to pass all existing exceptions inside py internals such as copy.py, decimal.py, gettext.py, etc, which is inconvenient there are so many of them that I could never reach exceptions caused by my code. p  pIf I set temporary setup to suspend on raise of exception which occurs after given breakpoint which I place at the last line of settings.py then django server does not start.p  pThanks in advance for your help.p

Negative 14012 pI am developing a WPF application using Windows 8 as developer machine with .NET 4.5. I have also used some DevExpress controls.p  pOn the developer machine the applications UI responds normally.p  pWhen I test the application on Windows 7, either using virtual machines or other PCs, the UI is shown but it does not respond normally. For example, I have a DevExpress Grid Control, and when i click on a row the row isnt highlighted as selected, when the mouse hover buttons and menus, also nothing happens.p  pThe magic begins when I press the CTRL key After that the WPF app responds normally, as it does on Windows 8.p  pI guess that when I press that key, something happens that has to do with Focus. Also when the window is resized the changes on the grid appears, but after it freezes again. Only by pressing CTRL the problem is gone.p  pAny ideas why that is happeningp  pThanks a lotp

Negative 14012 pWhat should the effect of the CSS rule texttransform capitalize be in the case where the text contained within the HTML tags is in Italian, Spanish, Portuguese, French, etc... these languages AFAIK dont make use of capitalizing the first letter of every word as this is specific to English and not to these locales. I was thinking of the case where you have a multilingual site where you can select the language for the content to be extracted from the database and displayed on the pages from a dropdown menu in the upperright hand corner. In this scenario, since the CSS should likely be the same and indpendent of the language, what should the effect be when the opening tag is, say,p  blockquote   plt html langfr , lt html langpt , lt html langes , lt html langit , etc...p blockquote  pinstead of p  blockquote   plt html langen p blockquote  pp  pIMHO this should turn off the behavior of texttransform capitalize, please correct me if Im wrong, or if this should be achieved in some other way, perhaps only by overriding the base CSS file with another CSS file for each supported language.p  pThank you for your replies concerning this I18N issue with CSS.p

Negative 14012 pFor a long time I have been using sfLapply for a lot of my parallel r scripts. However, recently as I have delved more into parallel computing, I have been using sfClusterApplyLB, which can save a lot of time if individual instances do not take the same amount of time to run. Were as sfLapply will wait for each instance of a batch to finish before loading a new batch which may lead to idle instances, with sfClusterApplyLB instances that complete their task will immediately be assigned to remaining elements in the list thus potentially saving quite a bit of time when instances do not take precisely the same amount of time. This has led me to question why would we ever want to NOT load balance our runs when using snowfall  The only thing I have found so far is that, when there is an error in the paralleled script, sfClusterApplyLB will still cycle through the entire list before giving an error, while sfLapply will stop after trying the first batch.

Negative 14012 pSo my question, as stated sort of in the title, is about the behaviour in some respects of the Javafx namely 2.2 Popup. Most of the time, you get a popup, and you give it a window to act as its parent, you give it some scene, and it tends to act relatively independently. p  pThis is all fine, however, in my case, I needed a popup that would anchor itself to a particular stage window, at a particular location, when an event happened. That popup would then, in turn, disappear when the window disappeared minimize, off screen, whatever, moved when it would, and in all essence and functionality, be a physical extension of the window, just with a custom shape. p  pNow of course, there are a lot of nuances with that, and everything for the most part, works great. The only thing I cant seem to figure out is that normally in a platform like Windows 7 64 bit, say. You open two programs, alright. Then if the programs are overlapping a little bit, whichever has focus gets to have the entire program displayed, whereas the other one gives the impression of being behind the other window. Whether or not windows actually renders application graphics behind a window when another has focus on the same spot, Im not sure.. Normally, javafx also supports this functionality just fine. But for some reason, The Popup class in javafx see docs a hrefhttpdocs.oracle.comjavafx2apijavafxstagePopup.html relnofollowherea doesnt do that. Its always on top of whatever its displayed with, without exception. For the point of completeness, heres my pretty straightforward popup code at least the part pertaining to showing it and its properties p  precode        Popup myPop  new Popup         Popup Property Setter         ampampampampampampampampampampampampampampampampampampampampampampampampampampampampampampampampampampampampampampampampampampampampampampampampampampampampampampampampampampampampampampampampampampampampampampamp         myPop.setWidthwidth         myPop.setHeightinitialHeight         myPop.setAutoHidefalse         myPop.setAutoFixfalse         myPop.setHideOnEscapefalse         myPop.setXxLocation         myPop.setYyLocation         ampampampampampampampampampampampampampampampampampampampampampampampampampampampampampampampampampampampampampampampampampampampampampampampampampampampampampampampampampampampampampampampampampampampampampampamp         end of Popup Properties         myPop.getContent.addmainanchor         myPop.showFileChooserWindow.getstage codepre  pmain anchor has some various components i include inside of the myPop popup, and FileChooserWindow is a nonnull parent window that will be open at the time of this method calling without exception. p  pHere is a screenshot as well of the behaviour Im referring to.

Also, the window that the popup is anchored to can be seen in the back of the pdf poking out from the left.  img srchttpi.stack.imgur.com9Xj1k.png altImage Of the stubborn popupp  pAny help you guys can give would be much appreciated.

Negative 14012 pSo heres a question. What I want to do is generate a data structure given a set of input values.p  pSince this is a multiple language submission, lets consider the input list to be an array of keyvalue pairs.

Negative 14012 pI have developed an ExtendedDataModel that supports Pagination on the server side by querying a db. Everything works as i expected, the pagination occurs and works fine. But, at the same time, i want to load the data of each page in client side with ajax, so i would also like to set the clientRows property for my extendedDataTable, and not only the rows attribute that divides each logical page. In general, i want to be able to set clientRows lt rows, so i get pagination  ajax loading in each page. But, at the moment this only works when i set clientRowsrows which obviously isnt what i need. p  pWhat is happening right now is that if i set the clientRows attribute, then the walk method recieves a range which goes only up to clientRows rows, and ignores the row attribute completely. If i dont set clientRows, then the row attribute is passed ok as the range limit totalRows. I dont know if this helps.p  pI post relevant code below. p  pThe PaginationDataModel is as followsp  precodepublic abstract class PaginationDataModelltTgt extends ExtendedDataModelltTgt   private SequenceRange cachedRange private Integer cachedRowCount private ListltTgt cachedList private Object rowKey        param firstRow   param numRows   return   public abstract ListltTgt getDataListint firstRow, int numRows public abstract Object getKeyT t public abstract int getTotalCount  Override public void walkFacesContext ctx, DataVisitor dv, Range range, Object argument       SequenceRange sr  SequenceRange range      if cachedList  null  equalRangescachedRange, sr          cachedList  getDataListsr.getFirstRow, sr.getRows         cachedRange  sr           for T t  cachedList          if getKeyt  null                            the 2nd param is used to build the client id of the table              row, i.e. mytable234inputname, so dont let it be null.                          throw new IllegalStateExceptionfound null key                  dv.processctx, getKeyt, argument           The rowKey is the id from getKey, presumably obtained from  dv.process....

Negative 14012 pI recently set up a Mavericks Server with Xcode Continuous Integration. I created a bot and the bot itself works well running tests and archiving from a remote git server by polling.p  pMy problem is that when I use the web view to view logs the page does not refresh automatically. As an example if I open the server while a integration test is running or if I start integration tests manually from the web view the information just show the spinning wheel like it keeps running, and I have to refresh the page manually to get updated information.p  pThe same happens when I use the Big Screen mode that cycles through the bots showing various information. The views never refresh. I thought that was the whole point with Big Screen to have a screen that always show updated information.p  pI have tried with several different browsers on different machines, and restarted the Xcode service on the server and restarted the server itself with no change. I also tried creating a test project that uses a git repository stored locally on the OS X Server.p  pHas anyone had similar issues Does this work at all Ive tried googling but cant find anything.p
Negative 14012 pWe know how to compose functions codeX gt M[Y]code, where codeMcode is a monad, with codegtgtcode. p  pFor example if I have functions codegetOrdersList[Order]code and codegetOrderItemsorder OrderList[OrderItem]code I can easily compose them to get codegetAllOrderItems List[OrderItem]codep  pre val getAllOrderItems  getOrders  getOrderItems  pre  pThis composition works emiffem codeListcode is a monad and provides codeflatMap[B]f A gt List[B]codep  pSuppose both functions codegetOrdercode and codegetOrderItemscode return codeOption[List]code rather than codeListcode. Can we still compose those functions with codegtgtcode   No, since there is no codeflatMapcode for codeOption[List]code.p  pIn order to compose  codegetOrdercode and codegetOrderItemscode we have to write a emwrapperem codeListTcode, which wraps codeOption[List]code and any codeM[List]code where codeMcode is a monad and provides codeflatMapcode. Now we can redefine the functions to return codeListTcode and then compose those functions with codegtgtcode as we used to.p  pDoes it make sense p

Negative 14012 pI would like to disable cstates on my computer.p  pI disabled cstate on BIOS but I dont obtain any result. However, I found an explanation  Most newer Linux distributions, on systems with Intel processors, use the intelidle driver probably compiled into your kernel and not a separate module to use Cstates. This driver uses knowledge of the various CPUs to control Cstates without input from system firmware BIOS. This driver will mostly ignore any other BIOS setting and kernel parametersp  pI found two solutions to solve this problem but I dont know how to applyp  p1   so if you want control over Cstates, you should use kernel parameter intelidle.maxcstate0 to disable this driver.p  pI dont know neither how I can check the value of intelidle.maxcstate  and neither how I can change its value.p  p2  To dynamically control Cstates, open the file devcpudmalatency and write the maximum allowable latency to it. This will prevent Cstates with transition latencies higher than the specified value from being used, as long as the file devcpudmalatency is kept open. Writing a maximum allowable latency of 0 will keep the processors in C0p  pI cant read the file cpudmalatency.p  pThanks for your help.p  pComputer Intel Xeon CPU E52620 Gnome 2.28.2 Linux 2.6.32358p

Negative 14012 pThough I have been developing with Sql Server for a log time, the primary reason I wanted to move to MySql was because of some client requirement.

How do I access the id from variable of outer from inside of any of the doSomething methods  The only thing I can think of is to use the syntax     var x  outer.id but the method that has knowledge of the name of the variable of that particular instance.p  pSo I have to create a function that makes one of these things, and use a temporary variable inside that function thats assigned to the object, and refer to that variable within doSomething.p  pIs that the best wayp  p[edit] My proposed solution I mentioned above would look like thisp  precodevar outer       list [                      field1 111,             field2 222,             doSomething function                  var x outer.id                      ,                      field1 333,             field2 444,             doSomething function                  var x outer.id                            ],      id 0,  codepre  pIm trying to avoid the inner objects from knowing the identifier outer...  but I guess thats the best that we can do  and probably good enough.p

Negative 14012 pIm going to explain what Im trying to do before I ask my specific question.p  pIm taking a large set of JSON data from a CouchDB of keys mapping to values which contain the URL of other JSON objects. I wrote a python file that parses through the original JSON object, opens the URL to the other ones contained in there, and saves all the data in a URL. However, it takes about 11 seconds to open this URL every time.p  pIs there a possible way that I can have a python file to parse this JSON object every 15 minutes or so and host it online so that I can access it without it taking forever to load but still be able to update every 15 minutes p  pI am using the data from this JSON object to make a javascriptjquery web page and the web page takes forever to load as well.p  pThank youp

The 2nd parameter BSTR  colors suppose to stand for the 1st string address in my string array.p  pNow this is the code I used to call up the interface from my C applicationp  precodeICertainInterface obj  GetInterface string[] strArray  new string[4]  strArray[0]  aaa strArray[1]  bbb strArray[2]  ccc strArray[3]  ddd  obj.Func4, ref strArray[0] codepre  pOnce I run the application, error given Attempted to read or write protected memory. This wont happen if the array size is only 1. It seems to me that, because the string array is managed data in C. So the memory allocation is not predictable, Once I pass strArray[0] as a reference to C interface, the interface will take it as the starting address of an array and assume add by 4 will get the address for next element but which could not be go in the same way in C memory allocation.p  pI searched some post from online, seems most interfaces user ref string[] as the pointer to an C array but not like this ref string which I can only refer to the 1st element in the array I even dont know if it is the right approach, because in C the 1st element address is equivalent to the array address.p  pFurther more, I did a same test in excel VBA code which called the same interfacep  precodeDim msColor4 As String msColor0  aaa msColor1  bbb msColor2  ccc msColor3  ddd  Dim obj as ICertainInterface  Set obj  GetInterface  Call obj.Func4, msColor0 codepre  pThis VBA code works perfect without any error. p  pNow I totally have no idea how to fix this in my C application.

That makes sense of course, it simply transitions from 345 to 15. I could fix this by transitioning from 345 degrees to 375 degrees, but that makes it hard to use predefined css classes.p  pAny ideas to get this working I can always revert to javascript animation as a workaround, but i really prefer css transitions.p

Im assuming, maybe incorrectly, that by doing these checks this will help lower the amount of time jQuery is spending on each page running unobtrusive wireup code that isnt necessary based on the current view.p  pIs this a common practice to follow for unobtrusive javascript or is there a more common practicebr Note This is not SPA.p  precodefunction       if .flagdialog.length gt 0   check if this block is even necessary for the current page         document.onclick, .flagdialog button.c, function               ui.modalDialog.close.flagdialog             return false                   more code...       function       if .commentsection.length gt 0   check if this block is even necessary for the current page         document.onclick, .commentsection button.s, function                ....                   more code...       codepre

Negative 14012 pI have a web page that is supposed to start a longrunning process. By longrunning here I mean it might take an hour or so. I dont want the web page to sit there for an hour, so I create a Process object, start it up with no wait, and then return an ok I started it message. The process updates some files, and I plan to have a log that the user can check to see if its done. Thats not the issue. My problem is, its timing out at 20 minutes. If I modify parameters on the job so it runs in less than 20 minutes everything works fine, it does its updates, the unicorns frolic in the pasture, and everything is good. But theres a timeout somewhere killing it at 20 minutes.p  pI searched for a property on Process to specify the time limit, and no luck. This limit must be settable somewhere. Any idea wherep

Negative 14012 pI am well experienced in the C languages, but for a project that I have been assigned in one of my classes, I am considering using it as a project to introduce me into Python.

Negative 14012 pI want to set an alarm thats repeating in different ways, for example, every day, every week, every other week, on weekdays, on weekends, etc.. The problem is with weekdays and weekends. I know that for example Vibrator has an option to set repetition pattern, so i was wondering if AlarmManager has it too I couldnt find anything on this. Obviously, i can calculate times myself and set every day repeating alarm 5 times for weekdays, and 2 times for weekends, but Im wondering if theres a better way i didnt find  Thanks p

Negative 14012 pIm working on a project that needs to create a XML with certain data on a certain format, send it to a thirdparty service, and then process the result. The thirdpartys function here is to validate both the data and the format of the XML, and then create a codified string a stamp certifying everything complies with the requeriments. This stamp has then to be added to the original XML and stored on database.p  pNow, the thirdparty is still to be chosen, so I have to create my project in a way it can work with so far two different web services before release, with the chance of adding another one and, after release, changing the chosen one. Although the final result is the same the stamping of the XML each web service does things differently e.g. one returns only the stamp string, while the other returns the XML with the stamp included, and the pending one returns the byte array of a zip file containing the XML I dont know who told them that was a good idea, but meh, thats another storyp  pWith this in mind, I decided to create a static class that wraps the web service calls one method per web service. All these methods receive the XML and return either the stamped XML or an XML with an error code and message in case something went wrong. The class that handles the data has then only to create the required XML, call one of these methods, and process the result.p  pSo far it looks something like thisp  precodepublic class EDocument      This class handles all the data that will be included in the XML      public void Stamp              Here the XML string is created, sent to the correspondig thirdparty web service, and processed back          string xmlString         code to create the XML         ...          If needed, I only have to change this line to call the corresponding method         WebServiceCalls.MainWebServiceCall stamper  WebServiceCalls.FirstServiceCall         stamper.BeginInvokexmlString, StampCallback, null           public void StampCallbackIAsyncResult ar              AsyncResult result  AsyncResultar         WebServiceCalls.MainWebServiceCall caller  WebServiceCalls.MainWebServiceCallresult.AsyncDelegate         string response  caller.EndInvokear         Call another async method to save to database the stamp, create the XML file, email and store it, and notify the results...         or create the exception with the error details and raise event here to notify the error       codepre  pWeb service calls...p  precodepublic static class WebServiceCalls      Here Ill put the necessary web service calls. In the end there will be only one,     but if on future the web service changes, a method with the same signature will be created here     replacing the previous one      public delegate string MainWebServiceCallstring XmlData      public static string FirstServiceCallstring XmlData              FirstWebService firstWs  new FirstWebService         string serviceResult  firstWs.StampXmlData This returns only the stamp string         Check the result, add the stamp to the original XML or create the error XML, and return...         return serviceResult           public static string SecondServiceCallstring XmlData              SecondWebService secondWs  new SecondWebService         string serviceResult  secondWs.StampXmlData This returns the XML with the stamp already added         Check the result, create the error XML if something went wrong, and return...         return serviceResult           public static string ThirdServiceCallstring XmlData              ThirdWebService thirdWs  new ThirdWebService         string serviceResultString         byte[] serviceResult  thirdWs.StampXmlData This sigh returns the byte array of a ZIP file...

Negative 14012 pI have a largish 2d numpy array, and I want to extract the lowest 10 elements of each row as well as their indexes. Since my array is largish, I would prefer not to sort the whole array.p  pI heard about the codeargpartitioncode function, with which I can get the indexes of the lowest 10 elementsp  precodetop10indexes  np.argpartitionmyBigArray,10[,10] codepre  pNote that codeargpartitioncode partitions axis 1 by default, which is what I want. The result here has the same shape as myBigArray containing indexes into the respective rows such that the first 10 indexes point to the 10 lowest values.p  pstrongHow can I now extract the elements of codemyBigArraycode corresponding to those indexesstrongp  pObvious fancy indexing like codemyBigArray[top10indexes]code or codemyBigArray[,top10indexes]code do something quite different. I could also use list comprehensions, something likep  precodearray[row[idxs] for row,idxs in zipmyBigArray,top10indexes] codepre  pbut that would incur a performance hit iterating numpy rows and converting the result back to an array.p  pnb I could just use codenp.partitioncode to get the values, and they may even correspond to the indexes or may not.., but I dont want to do the partition twice if I can avoid it.p

Negative 14012 pWe have a Coldfusion server that hosts multiple applications, all in their own subfolder. Something likep  ul liwebrootfolderapplicationAli liwebrootfolderapplicationBli ul  pFurthermore, on the development server, we have a copy of a given application per developer, each being a Subversion working copyp  ul liwebrootfolderapplicationAdev1li liwebrootfolderapplicationAdev2li liwebrootfolderapplicationAdev3li ul  pSince we are running Coldfusion 7 with major resistance to upgrading, I find myself stuck as I want to use CFCs in packages. Here are the various issues, attempted solutions and issues with these toop  ul liUsing a relative component name only works if there is a single package, which would make a mess of components in a single folder.li liUsing subpackages works as long as you never reference components in parent packages, which seems to easily happen when extending, instanciating or using a component as a cfargument type.li liUsing a full CFC path starting from the root doesnt work with our multiple copies per developer.  Using a dynamic path with a variable was my solution as of now... until I realized it doesnt work with extends or cfargument type...  Using server mappings doesnt work in development as we would have one alias per developer copy. I expect the code to be folderindependant.  Using application specific mappings defined in Application.cfc doesnt work because CF7 and not CF8.li liCreating local dummy copies of needed CFCs and cfincludeing the content of the actual CFCs with relative paths .... was my previous solution. It works, but its so messy having these clones all over.  Very recently, I have discovered this solution does not always work. Coldfusion gets confused by samenamed functions being included in various CFCs apparently.li liUsing development Coldfusion servers on each developers machine, allowing for the application path to always be codewebrootfolderapplicationAcode suggested by Mark A Kruger.  Main issue here would be to convince the computer team to let us install this. It might take a long time, which I fear I dont have.  There may be other issues with network configuration giving access to DB maybe, Im not sure which will also have to go through the network team and take a while, if its even allowed.li ul  h2One website per application  folder  Changing the rooth2  pI have taken time to explore the way the websitesapplications are configured in IIS 6. After some research, I found out its possible to create bindings just like what I was used to under UnixApache. At the moment, all applications are in their own subfolder of the web root. Aliases are configured, making domain.comappA point to the webrootfolderapplicationA folder, for example. But it is still a single IIS website with lots of sub paths. The Coldfusion root for CFC and includes is thus based on the root of that one website webrootfolder.p  pI made a quick test and managed to have a second IIS website on the server, bound to port 8080 instead of the default 80. I made this one point directly to webrootfolderapplicationAcfm which is really the root of the app. With this, Coldfusion recognizes that folder as the root and instanciating the Object CFC looks for it as codewebrootfolderapplicationAcfmObject.cfccode.p  pThis is exactly what we had in my previous job and it worked really well. That said, it was a small company and I fear this solution may have issues. Mostly how do I point people to this website Using port binding isnt very user friendly our users are not techies. Having a specific domain for each application sounds nice but might be costly, especially if HTTPS is involved or so Ive heard. Subdomains might be another solution but seems to have similar issues.p  h2So...h2  pHave I missed anything Am I stuck with one of the messy solutionsp  pI have access to the Coldfusion admin panel and possibly the IIS configuration, though Ill most likely be limited if a solution affects the paths or URLs of emotherem applications on the server.p

Negative 14012 pIv developed an SDK for all of my applications to use, and Im having a bit of problem.p  pIm using AFNetworking and FMDB, together and Im calling a method in codeapplicationDidEnterBackgroundcode  to send the data gathered in the current session, but it seem that the data doesnt come to the server from time to time, unless i relaunch the application from background.p  pIm testing from my iphone 6 and nothing is wrong, even with edge and very bad connection the data arrives to the server no matter what but in my other devices, like iphone 4s and iphone5, it doesnt always arrive when i left the application with simple click of home button.The weird part is, when i relaunch the application the data immediately arrives.p  pIs it a hardware problem that my old devices isnt fast enough p  pI dont think thats the problem, when i use the simulator it works without a problem, the data reaches everytime.p  pso any ideap  pOr any suggestions of where to call this methodp  pCheers.p
Negative 14012 pIm wondering if it would be possible to achieve an accelerate, then coast animation with css, like in this a hrefhttpbl.ocks.orgmbostock10395901 relnofollow3D.js exampleap  pBasically, an object starts with 0 speed and accelerated its movement until a certain point, and after that, it keeps a constant speed.p  pI thought it could be accomplished by applying the rotation animation twice to the same element, but with different parameters   first rotation the object rotates during 2 seconds, with no delay, with an easein function   after that the object rotates during 1.5 seconds with a 2 seconds delay to account for the first rotation, with a linear function. This time the rotation repeats infinitely. p  pSo I tried the following codep  precode.square      width 120px     height 120px     background c00     webkitanimation         spin 2s 0 easein 1,         spin 1.5s 2s linear infinite     mozanimation         spin 2s 0 easein 1,         spin 1.5s 2s linear infinite     animation         spin 2s 0 easein 1,         spin 1.5s 2s linear infinite       mozkeyframes spin      100  moztransform rotate360deg   webkitkeyframes spin       100  webkittransform rotate360deg    keyframes spin       100  transformrotate360deg   codepre  pI know its not the same as the 3D.js example, but its close enough. The problem is that the object stops a bit before finishing the first rotation and it looks really weird.p  pIve prepared a fiddle to show the problem a hrefhttpjsfiddle.nete0sLc8sw relnofollowhttpjsfiddle.nete0sLc8swap  pAny ideap  pThanks everybody for your helpp

Negative 14012 pstrongBriefstrongp  pI am relatively new to Django but have been working with Python for some time. What I am attempting to do seems to be a little complicated to explain, but I will try my best to describe my Django configuration and what steps Ive taken in an attempt to attain the desired behavior or results.p  pI have searched Google for some examples on how to validate fields upon submission from the admin user interface. At this point the closest thing I have seen my admin UI do is if a required field is left empty, then when the entry is saved the admin interface produces an error requiring me to put some data in the field before it can continue. However unlike a regular view if I enter alpha numeric data in a numeric only field and click save, the admin seems to be successful and states the entry was updated when clearly it was not..p  pIm not sure why the admin would do this seemingly by default but I have tried a few things that were suggested during Google searches.p  psome people recommended setting the form variable in admin.py. For examplep  precodefrom django.contrib import admin from  models import MyModelUser from forms import Sheet1  class SheetUserDataAdminadmin.ModelAdmin     form  Sheet1 admin.site.registerMyModelUser, SheetUserDataAdmin codepre  pBut I must explain that I am using a form wizard so in forms.py I have a multipart form linked to a model well actually its one of the multiple models constructed from a single abstract base, but I believe Django just treats it as an ordinary model. But this raises a problem for the above code because now I have to combine multiple forms like sop  precodefrom django.contrib import admin from  models import MyModelUser from forms import Sheet1, Sheet2, Sheet3  class SheetUserDataAdminadmin.ModelAdmin     form  Sheet1, Sheet2, Sheet3 admin.site.registerMyModelUser, SheetUserDataAdmin codepre  pWhich Im not sure how to go about doing that.

Negative 14012 pQuick rundown on what Im trying to do. I have a codeforcode loop creating an array using the value of codeicode, where codeicode goes from 0 to a rather high number 90000. While in the for loop, I want to have a counter that updates some text on the screen basically a percentage of how far along it is. I also need to use the array, when the loop is finished. So far the only thing Ive gotten working is the following a basic examplep  precodefunctioncallback      var counterText  document.getElementByIdtext     for var i0 ilt100001 i          functionindex              window.setTimeoutfunction                  counterText.innerHTML  index                 if index1  i callback             , 0         i      functiondata      alertDONE  codepre  pThis works perfectly in Chrome. But in FF and IE11, the text doesnt update until after the loop is complete and then you see the alert and text at the same time.p  pIve tried a number of different things. Almost everything Ive come across regarding a DOM counter and loops uses some form of an codeifcode statement instead of a codeforcode loop. The problem with using an codeifcode is that it seems to be magnitudes slower than a codeforcode, to the point of being unusable with the size of looping I need.p  pIm not sure why the above function doesnt work in FFIE.p  pjsfiddle of it a hrefhttpjsfiddle.netuxs84g1y1 relnofollowhttpjsfiddle.netuxs84g1y1ap

Negative 14012 pI am trying to add a black status bar into my a hrefhttpwww.bakerframework.com relnofollowBakerFramework for iOS Newsstand Appa when issues are viewed in iOS 7. Previously in iOS 7, the status bar disappeared when issues were viewed.p  pThe first page of the magazine is the cover page, and consists of an HTML page with an codeIMGcode tag in the body, which is sized to codemaxwidth100 maxheight100code. In Safari, viewing that HTML file, resizing the window to the proper aspect ratio, the image simply fills the screen and there is nothing else  no additional spaces or anything. The image is of the correct aspect ratio 1536px x 2008px to fit in the iPad screen under the status bar and then fill the screen perfectly. Now initially, without the status bar, the codeIMGcode fills the iPad screen except for an empty 20px space at the bottom. But when we add the 20px status bar to the top, everything should be perfect, rightp  pI added this code into the codedidFinishLaunchingWithOptionscode methodp  precodeif [[[UIDevice currentDevice] systemVersion] floatValue] gt 7      self.window.clipsToBounds  YES     [[UIApplication sharedApplication] setStatusBarStyleUIStatusBarStyleLightContent]     [self.window setAutoresizingMaskUIViewAutoresizingNone]     self.window.frame   CGRectMake0, 20, self.window.frame.size.width, self.window.frame.size.height20     self.window.bounds  CGRectMake         self.window.frame.origin.x,         self.window.frame.origin.y,         self.window.frame.size.width,         self.window.frame.size.height       codepre  p...and this into the BakerViewController.m filep  precode BOOLprefersStatusBarHidden      return NO  codepre  pThis gives me a status bar like I want, and it moves my content down 20px so that the status bar is not overlaying my content and so that the cover codeIMGcode fills the rest of the screen perfectly. However, it also seems to keep the empty 20px space underneath my content, shoving that space offscreen Since this is a BakerFramework App, all my content is HTML. In the HTML, sometimes we have a CSS codepositionfixed bottom0code element on some pages. This fixed position element seems to locate itself along the base of the bottom space, 20px under the bottom of the screen, instead of along the base of the screen itself I expected the bottom space to be completely removed by the above code changes, but it has not been. p  pIts like the code above doesnt actually resize the HTML document window... rather it only moves the HTML document window down by 20px. I need to actually resize the HTML document window.p  pI am very, very new to iOS development, so I will need handholding. If you have any suggestions for me to get rid of the empty 20px space under my content, I would very much appreciate them.p  pThanksp

Negative 14012 pFirst, the big picture. Im writing a codesinatracodebased web app. One thing its going to do is determining users birth years. For that it interacts with the other app. It first asks the users data, like first name, last name, sex, birthday month and day, whatever. And then makes search requests with all these data plus some year 2015, 2014, so on.

Negative 14012 pIs it possible to perform circular crossautocorrelation on 1D arrays with a numpyscipymatplotlib function I have looked at numpy.correlate and matplotlib.pyplot.xcorr based on the numpy function, and both seem to not be able to do circular crosscorrelation.p  pTo illustrate the difference, I will use the example of an array of [1, 2, 3, 4]. With circular correlation, a periodic assumption is made, and a lag of 1 looks like [2, 3, 4, 1]. The python functions Ive found only seem to use zeropadding, i.e., [2, 3, 4, 0].

Any suggestions as to approaches I can take to do this.p  precode9 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0  0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0   include ltstdio.hgt include ltstdlib.hgt  int mainint argc, char argv[]    int A    FILE file    char ch    int i    int j    int N    int t     if  argc  2   argc should be 1 for correct execution            printf you need to input one argumentn        else        file  fopenargv[1], r opens file name       iffile  0          printfFile couldnt me openedn       else           ifchfgetcfile1             N  ch  0                      A  mallocN  sizeofint            for i  0 i lt N i             A[i]  mallocN  sizeofint           whilechfgetcfile  EOF             i4             for i1iltNi                   for j1jltNj             ifiltN                A[i][i] ch2  0                      for i  0 i lt N i              for j  0 j lt N j                printfd , A[i][j]             printfn                    fclose file              codepre

I thougt about reflections, but this is bad when it comes to performance as the controller code is executed for every request. p  pThe nicest solution would be without logic in the view anyway..p
Negative 14012 pI have a VS project with several XAML designed windows and user controls. A while ago they still opened fine in Blend 5, but recently dont know what changed it doesnt want to load any file anymore. On loading even the simplest window, it gives lots of errors likep  precodegt UserControl is not supported in windows presentation foundation.  gt Window is not supported in windows presentation foundation  gt Slider is not supported in windows presentation foundation codepre  petcetera. Which is obviously silly, as these are very basic components of WPF. Also, in Visual Studio 2012 the windows load absolutely fine. p  pI did find this a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions2174621blendwindowisnotsupportedinawpfprojectvery related questiona, so I ensured that my project setup has indeed an codeAnyCPUcode setup.

Negative 14012 pIm trying to model a manytomany relationship using domain driven design.p  pA scheme in my model has zero or more parent schemes and zero or mode child schemes. The relationship between a pair of schemes is described as followsp  pParentScheme, ChildScheme, RelationshipRule, RelationshipPriorityp  pI was thinking of modelling this using the following Scheme entityp  precodepublic class Scheme       public int Id get set     public string SchemeName get set     public IEnumerableltSchemegt Parents get set     public IEnumerableltSchemegt Children get set  codepre  pThe problem with the above entity is that it doesnt capture the RelationshipRule and RelationshipPriority values. So I was considering creating a separate entity named SchemeRelationship p  precodepublic class SchemeRelationship       public int Id get set     public Scheme Scheme get set     public Scheme ChildScheme get set     public string RelationshipRule get set     public int RelationshipPriority get set  codepre  pAnd also changing my Scheme entity to refer to becomep  precodepublic class Scheme       public int Id get set     public string SchemeName get set     public IEnumerableltSchemeRelationshipgt Parents get set     public IEnumerableltSchemeRelationshipgt Children get set  codepre  pThe problem I have with this approach is that in my domain a scheme relationship isnt really an entity. It doesnt really make sense for it to have an id. Perhaps it would make more sense to model the relationship as a value object The only reservation I have about making it a value object is that value objects are supposed to be immutable, yet in our domain the RelationshipPriority could change for a relationship. Im new to domaindrivendesign so any advice on how best to model this would be appreciated.p

Negative 14012 pIm trying to trigger a SPI communication using a timer on the NXP LPC1788 microcontroller. In the features of the DMA user manual its written that the controller can use a timer for triggering a DMA burst.

However the next field in the query pinged has no value in the database and this is where it fails.  If I add a value to this field then the new value is added to the sql exception error message but I run into problems a few fields later where there are more fields that have no values.  If I add values to all fields then the query runs.p  pI dont want to start modifying the wordpress database.  How can I handle empty fields in the database that are not null but have no valuep  pstrongUPDATEstrong I think it is the date fields that are causing the problems.  The default value for a date in the wordpress database is 00000000 000000.  If I have a row in the database that has values for all fields then the dates like 00000000 000000 dont cause a problem.  However if I have a row that has fields with no value and other date fields have values like 00000000 000000 then I get the above error.  Alternatively if all date fields have proper date values then fields with no value dont cause any problems.  So it appears that the problem is only caused when I have rows with 00000000 000000 as the value for date fields and I also have other fields with no value.  All my date fields are marked with TemporalTemporalType.TIMESTAMP like sop  precodeTemporalTemporalType.TIMESTAMP Columnnamepostmodified private Date postModified codepre

Negative 14012 pIve used Visual Lint as a frontend for PClint in the past and somehow configured it to use a different options.lnt file for different projects.  My recollection, which might be incorrect, is that it was configured to automatically pick up anything called options.lnt in any projects directory  i.e. I didnt have to configure this for each project individually.  p  pSo for example I might have two projects, ProjX and ProjY, and I might have different options.lnt files in each of themp  precodeCMyProjectsProjXoptions.lnt CMyProjectsProjYoptions.lnt codepre  pPossibly those might refer to certain sets of general options stored in other files for example I have CMyProjectsLintoptions.lnt for very general things, and then more specific options files for things related to certain packages for example I have CMyProjectsLintoptionsboost.lnt for use by projects that use Boost.  So if ProjX uses Boost, CMyProjectsProjXoptions.lnt will contain at least the linesp  precodeCMyProjectsLintoptions.lnt CMyProjectsLintoptionsboost.lnt codepre  pWhereas perhaps ProjY doesnt use Boost, and so its options.lnt would have the general line, but not the Boostspecific line.p  pThis was all working fine, but Ive migrated to a new computer, and I cant seem to get it working again.  When I run Visual Lint against ProjX, it shows messages that should be suppressed by for example entries in CMyProjectsLintoptionsboost.lnt.p  pI have gone into Visual Lints Tools  Options, and under the Analysis tab, I have set Preferred Analysis method to Per project.  I have the Professional edition, which I believe is required for this functionality.  I am using version 5 whereas the previous machine, on which this was working, was version 4.  p  pAm I perhaps missing some additional configuration I need to set up in order to get Visual Lint to pay attention to the projects options filep

Negative 14012 pI wonder if there exists any Scalapack routine that may convert a triangular matrix back to a general one, i.e. copies the lowerupper part to the upperlower part  I couldnt find it yet. I know there exists an easy workaraound using pgeadd with manipulation of the diagonal, but that one consumes twice as much memory as theoretically needed and I cant afford that... So it seems strange to me, that ScalapackPBLAS doesnt provide any routine solving this relative simple problem. If anybody knows more than I please let me knowp  pThanksp

Negative 14012 pIm working on a filtered live search module with Meteor.js.p  pstrongUsecase amp problemstrongp  pA user wants to do a search through all the users to find friends. But I cannot afford for each user to ask the complete users collection. The user filter the search using checkboxes. Id like to subscribe to the matched users.

Negative 14012 pOkay, so I am working on a project for my Java class where we basically create Microsoft Paint. My professor has a few guidelines as for where we put certain code however. I am to create a Frame class that creates the JFrame and a Panel class that creates the JPanel. My issue right now is that a JToolBar which is where my free hand button, line button, and other shape buttons are needs to be added directly to the JFrame, but the MouseListeners and ActionListeners are in my JPanel class. Whenever I was just testing my code, I found that if I added my JToolBar directly to my JPanel class, all of the listeners work like they should, but if I add the JToolBar to my JFrame class, the listeners do not work. Any other time I would just have the JFrame in the same class as my JPanel to fix this error, but as I said, my professor wants them to be in separate classes. I do not feel like I should add my MouseListeners to my JFrame class obviously because they need to paint stuff on my JPanel. I can post my code if needed, but I just feel like I might be adding my ActionListener in the wrong place or something really simple like that. Thank you And just in case I can prevent this response, I need the JToolBar added to the JFrame to make it moveable, adding it to my JPanel keeps it stationary.p

Negative 14012 pI am writing a commandline tool for Android such that it would be called via adb shell or the like, as opposed to being launched via the Android interface.p  pI want to write something that uses the same kind of information as the pm list packages tool that you can run from an adb shell, which I presume uses getPackageManager or something like it.p  pSo Ive figured out how to compile and run a Java tool in Dalvik, but I cant figure out how to get it the context it needs for getPackageManager to work.p  pIve also tried writing a command line tool using Android Studio by simply not creating any views and by calling my code and then finish in onCreate, but thats not quite right either, as it still briefly takes over the Android interface and it has an icon installed and so forth, which is, Im fairly certain, not how pm works.p  pSo  how do I write a script like pm that can access installed package info, without creating an Android Appp

Negative 14012 pI am trying to create a Chrome extension with the following specsp  ol liInstall extension.  Click on the extension icon. li liEvery time the icon is clicked, a background script checks if access token exists. li liIf access token doesnt exist which is the case for the first time user, a separate window will display using window.open prompting the user to login. li liIf access token exists, a chrome extension popup should show up once the icon is clicked. li ol  pIn my current implementation, I am not setting a default popup in manifest.json. If the background script finds an access token to exist, it sets the popup using chrome.browserAction.setPopup. But, the popup shows up only after I click the icon twice. I know this is because it sets the popup on the first click, and then displays it on the second. But, is there any way to get it to display on the firstp  pIs there a better way of implementing this logic so I dont have to keep setting the popup every time access token is detected and requiring the user to click twice this is not very userfriendly in my opinion p  pThanksp

Negative 14012 pI am facing an issue right now in my application, below are few details around it.p  pHigh Level Design  Our SPA application talks to a Windows Service via SelfHosted SignalR. This windows service runs as a Local System user on clients machines. This service other than communicating with certain scanners connected to client machine , is also responsible for installing a new version of the required components  update itself with new version Kind of like windows updates. All components we are sending for update have to signed digitally. There is a logic built in this windows service that  validates signature of the downloaded packages with CERT Revocation list over internet using WinCert.dll. p  pClient Requirement  Few of our clients would now have Proxy configured on their client machines. Which is an issue for our windows service now  , as it is running under local system account , it cant reach to internet to download updates  validate against CERT revocation list. And if we try to retrieve proxy settings inside service we cant get those as proxy is configured for logged in user and not local system.p  pDesign to Address Requirement  So what we are doing is , we are launching an EXE using pinvoke like CreateProcessAsUser etc. for logged in user from windows service. Inside this EXE we are retrieving proxy settings now we can query coz EXE is launched as logged in user and setting them at process level. Then we are hosting a Duplex WCF Service using named pipe  tcp binding inside EXE itself. Once EXE is started , proxy retrived and service is hosted , we are making requests from windows service to the WCF Service hosted inside EXE and raising callbacks to service from EXE. p  pIssue  The issue is that , we are not able to host WCF Service with TCP  Pipe binding inside EXE , when that EXE is launched from Windows Service. However if I launch that EXE manually from windows explorer by saying run as administrator , everything works fine. I am local administrator , so when I double click it  launch it from windows service for logged in user who is me, in task manager it shows me it is running as AUgane only , which is same when I say run as administrator. In both occasions it shows me I am launching exe for my user only. p  pFor PIPE binding p  ol lipWhen EXE is Launched from Windows service  It hosts the service , however when I try to communicate with it from service after my hosting is successfully which I very in logs , I am getting error There was no endpoint listening at net.pipelocalhostValidatorServicepipe1 that could accept the message. This is often caused by an incorrect address or SOAP action. pli lipWhen EXE is Launched from Windows Explorer as Administrator  When I do this I skip launch logic for EXE and make WCF calls  directly . Everything works in this scenario.pli ol  pFor TCP binding p  ol lipWhen EXE is Launched from Windows service  It hosts the service , however when I try to communicate with it from service after my hosting is successfully which I very in logs , I am getting error The service endpoint failed to listen on the URI net.tcplocalhost9931ValidatorService because access was denied.  Verify that the current user is granted access in the appropriate allowAccounts section of SMSvcHost.exe.config. Here it took all the suggestion provided in google and added my SID to SMSvcHost.exe.config to allowed accounts inside SMSvcHost.exe.config but that did not help.pli lipWhen EXE is Launched from Windows Explorer as Administrator  When I do this I skip launch logic for EXE and make WCF calls  directly . Everything works in this scenario. pli ol  pI think what I am seeing here is an obvious issue with launching code. As it is not able to launch EXE as an Administrator. I googled around a bit but suggestion offered were either tricky to implement or they are going to have me disable UAC , which is not possible when this app is distributed to thousands of clients. p  pI have attached here the code that I have wrote to launch the EXE , but it looks like something needs to be tweaked in this code to run the process as Administrator.p  pPlease suggest if you guys have came across anything like this before. Also suggest if this idea is architecturally correct. If you get a chance to look at the attached launch code , and point out something obvious then that will be very helpful.p  precode    public static bool LaunchUSCAsUserbool visible              IntPtr hUserToken  IntPtr.Zero         var startInfo  new STARTUPINFO         var procInfo  new PROCESSINFORMATION         var pEnv  IntPtr.Zero         int iResultOfCreateProcessAsUser          var bResult  true         var hImpersonationToken  IntPtr.Zero         var pSessionInfo  IntPtr.Zero          This gets us the session ID for whoever is logged into the pyshical console local keyboard, mouse, monitor         uint activeSessionID  WTSGetActiveConsoleSessionId          if activeSessionID  INVALIDSESSIONID                      throw new ExceptionString.FormatLaunchProcessAsUser WTSGetActiveConsoleSessionId returned INVALIDSESSIONID.

Negative 14012 pIm trying to build a new project in Backbone.js, having come from a background developing webapps in Java, PHP, Rails, Perl, and so on. Ive done a quite a bit of JS stuff, including JQuery and some Node, but Im having a little bit of trouble wrapping my head around the best practice for building entire apps in Backbone. It seems like the stuff in the tutorials tends to differ from how I see realworld applications implemented.p  pIve been reading Addy Osmanis a hrefhttpaddyosmani.github.iobackbonefundamentals relnofollowBackbone Fundamentalsa. His examples have you create a static HTML file into which you put the skeleton of the app, which is then modified by JS.

Negative 14012 pI am assembling a cross compiling unit testing rig for an ARM system and running the tests on a host machine with codeqemusystemarmcode. Specifically, Im using qemu to emulate the Stellaris LM3S6965 eval board as it contains a Cortex M3 processor like my target environment. The binary run in qemu is built with GNU Tools for ARM.p  pThere is no OS involved. The test suite is run as a bare metal application with qemu in codenographiccode mode. The toolchain and the test rig itself are working fine. And the tests successfully run to completion and produce test results within qemu just fine as well.p  pThe problem is in wrapping up qemu in an automated build tool Rake in this case. Other than keyboard commands I have not yet found a good way to cause qemu to exit after the test suite runs and spits out its results. This causes the build environment to hang  rely on user intervention.p  pI have looked high and low and have found no good sources on how to accomplish a simple exit after program termination. I did find a couple suggestions of running qemu with the codenorebootcode option and then triggering a system reset from the program running in the emulator. I have tried this. It works kinda. I write the appropriate values to the emulated processors reset vector after codemaincode executes, and this does trigger a reset. After running the test suite qemu reports catching a system reset. However, it reports this as a hardware error, dumps register contents, and then exits angry error message below. While this does accomplish exiting after the test suite runs, it then breaks the automated build script due to qemu exiting with an error condition.p  precodeqemu hardware error System reset codepre  pId like to avoid hacking the insertion of keyboard commands into the build to simulate user intervention. Id also like to avoid relying on qemu exiting in an error state.p  pIt seems Im close to a clean exit but not quite there.

Negative 14012 pI am trying to dig a bit deeper into memory allocation, addressing and I also run into the concept of stack alignment, and in general, memory alignment. I would like to understand if I got correctly all the concepts. My questions are all referred to nowdays computers and processors such as the one we have on our laptops. I wish to underline that I read lots of other questions on stackoverflow, and most of my actual knowledge come from them. p  pMy first doubts were related to the concept of memory word. The memory word define not only the registers and bus size, but also the basic memory unit e.g., 64 bit on 64bit arch, 32 bit on 32bit arch ecc. However, as far as I know, each address references exactly strong1 bytestrong of memory, regardless of the size of a memory word. So we might say that each byte has its own address. Butp  pstrong1strong Is it correct that the CPU is not able to access a single byte but it access the entire word in which that byte is contained Thus, if a specific byte is request for example, I access a the direct address of a emcharem, it access the entire word and makes some calculations to remove the other portion and return the exact bytep  pstrong2strong Is it then correct that the CPU can practically access ONLY memory word unit and that each memory word starts from a even address, multiple of the unit itselfp  pSo, for example, on a 64bit architecture the memory word are 8 bytes thus the example address 0x2710 10000 in base 10 would be the start of a memory word. If I try to access 0x2711 the CPU will access from 0x2710 to 0x2717 and then extract only the single byte. Correctp  pSecond. As, I said before, I run into the memory alignment. At start It created me some confusion. Please, help me to understand if I got it right. The problem essentially is related to performance or, in some cases, to SSE specific instructions that need 16bytes alignment. In the first case, for example, If on a 64bit arch a 8 bytes data e.g., a long int is stored across 2 memory words, the CPU needs 2 access instead of one. p  pstrong3strong So, take the following examplep  precode0x2710  ....  0x2711  ....  0x2712  ....  0x2713  ....  0x2714  data  0x2715  data  0x2716  data  0x2717  data  0x2718  data  0x2719  data  0x2720  data  0x2721  data  0x2722  ....  0x2723  ....  0x2724  ....  0x2725  ....  codepre  pIn this case memory is not aligned. Correct With alignment, CPU would have stored data only from 0x2710 or, if occupied until 0x2713, it would have inserted padding and then stored the 8bytes data from 0x2718. Rightp  pstrong4strong Thus, memory alignment essentially consists in storying multibyte data only starting from address which are multiple of the desired bytes unit usually, the memory word itself but also other custom units  e.g., using mpreferredstackboundaries on GCC. I said multibyte data because if the data is only onebyte it will always fit inside only a single word. Is all this correctp  pstrong5strong Memory alignment is applied by the compiler Thus, is it applied in the binary assembly code or it is applied in some way by the CPU when storing data And, isnt it a big waste of memory I mean, if it is always applied each multibyte data may imply also a padding I can be an enormous waste of memory spacep  pThats all Thanks, really thanks in advance p
Negative 14012 preimplementing an editor in MFC, I got stuck with a problem that seems to be unbelievable amp unsolvable at least to me Its very simple The editor starts and a custom CControlBarderived toolbar shows up, docked to the editors right edge. I maximize the editor but the toolbar remains in the same size, instead of stretching its height to fit the dimension of the editor.p  pAttempting to track down whats wrong, I spotted that the toolbars OnNcCalcSize handler receives from a certain point in the editors lifetime always delayed information about the window size  so when maximized, it receives that window is in original yet unmaximized state.

Negative 14012 pIm looking for the best way of storing list of entities of different Kinds that  have a common parent.

Negative 14012 pIts well known fact that exposing the STL containers over the boundary is very bad idea due to the compiler compatibility issues, move semantics, etc... Therefore the arraylike data is passed with pointers begin and size, or begin and end or with the custom object.p  pLogically, it seems that exposing constructors with codestdinitializerlistltgt constampcode over the boundary is a bad idea too. Is this correct Also, is there a way to ensure similar experience that codestdinitializerlistcode provides, but in the safe manner For example, having custom codeVectorcode object, which encapsulates codestdvectorltintgtcode but can be constructed using codeVector1,2,3,4,5code from other client assemblies.p
Negative 14012 pIm quite new into programming and Im really stuck with one problemp  pIm creating an app using MIT App Inventor 2. One function I would like to implement is sharing a file containing a list in textformat to the same app on another device. The other person should be able receive the file for example by email and open it directly with my app. The idea is that the list in the file should be shown with my app and afterwards also be saved within the app. I already managed to add an intentfilter into my androidmanifest.xml, so it is possible to open the app by clicking on the link. But this  only brings me to the start screen of my app and doesnt show the test that I wanted to share.p  pIve read a couple of times through the android help about intents and intentfilters. Also, I tried deeplinking. But all explanations seem to be too complicated and I just dont manage. Can anyone give me a detailed description of how to do thisp  pThank you very much in advancep

Negative 14012 pWith Retrofit, what is the best way of loading more data in a paginated REST responsep  h3Backgroundh3  pIm migrating to Retrofit from AsyncTasks  Loaders. Unlike the situation of OP in this related a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions24890133howtohandlepaginationinretrofitSO questiona, I would like to have Retrofit fetch data only on request as opposed to downloading all items at once. Currently, its easy to do this when the user scrolls to the end of the current list view page by invoking codeLoaderManager.restartLoadercode. p  pA sample response of the API our client consumesp  precode   data [            nid 4382,       commenttext some user comment, ...     , ...   ],   paging      nextPage httpapi.domain.netv2commentspage1amppageSize20amprequestLandmarkM4ewMnwxDUsdadf0NTIwfDU2OA3D3D,     itemsTotal 5164,     page 0,     pagerMax 218,     requestLandmark M4ewMnwxDUsdadf0NTIwfDU2OA     codepre  pI know that we can provide the page param to our APIService like thisp  precodepublic interface APIService    GETcommentspage    ListltCommentgt getCommentsPathpage int page  codepre  pHowever, the challenge is that we have many other endpoints that get us different lists of data besides comments user stories, likes, trending, etc, and we wouldnt like to write a codeloadMorecode method for each endpoint we have to fetch additional pages for if theres a better alternative. In other words, it would be clumsy to maintain a currentPageIndex for strongeachstrong GET requestservice we have as it would clutter the Fragment which hosts our list views. The codeLoaderManagercode structure worked neatly for us because we created a wrapper class that would simply take in the callback of the respective list view, and thus we had a single point to manage pagination regardless of data model type. That is, our Fragments recyclerview onScroll listener looked like thisp  precodeOverride public void onScrolledRecyclerView recyclerView, int dx, int dy      ...     mLoadHandler.handleNewItemLoadingfirstVisibleItem, visibleItemCount, totalItemCount     ...  codepre  pand mLoaderHandler is an instance ofp  precode   Handles new content loading for ListView if the list has been scrolled to the end   public class ListLoadMoreHandler       private static final int MAXPAGESTOLOAD  10      private boolean mLoadingContent     private int mPageIndex  0     private int mTotalItemCount     private final LoaderManager mLoaderManager     private final int mLoaderId     private final LoaderManager.LoaderCallbacksltgt mCallBack      public ListLoadMoreHandlerLoaderManager loaderManager,                                   int loaderId,                                   LoaderManager.LoaderCallbacksltgt callback          mLoaderManager  loaderManager         mLoaderId  loaderId         mCallBack  callback                  Trigger loading of new items when end of list view is reached       param firstVisibleItem first visible item in list view       param visibleItemCount visible items in list view       param totalItemCount total items in list view           public void handleNewItemLoadingint firstVisibleItem, int visibleItemCount, int totalItemCount          if totalItemCount  0  totalItemCount lt RestClient.DEFAULTPAGINATIONSIZE              return                   int visibleTrigger  2         if mPageIndex lt MAXPAGESTOLOAD ampamp mLoadingContent ampamp                 totalItemCount  visibleItemCount lt firstVisibleItem  visibleTrigger              Log.dTAG, restarting loader             mLoadingContent  true             mPageIndex             mLoaderManager.restartLoadermLoaderId, null, mCallBack                   ...  codepre  pAny suggestions on how to write a strongscalable, retrofitcompliantstrong version of ListLoadMoreHandlerp
