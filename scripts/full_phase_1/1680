As the testmakecounter function shows clearly, there is no way, that the closure lives longer than the variable codecntcode. Even if I removed the block inside codetestmakecountercode they would still have the identical lifetime. With the block, the codecountercode will die before codecntcode. And yet, Rust complains p  blockquote   psrcmain.rs4,2 error  captured variable codestatecode does not outlive the enclosing closure   srcmain.rs3,1 warning  note captured variable is valid for the anonymous lifetime 1 defined on the block at 30p blockquote  pIf you look at the codealtmakecountercode function now, the lifetime of codestatecode should basically cause the same error message, right If the code captures the state for the closure, it should not matter if the pointer is passed in or if the variable is bound inside the function, right But obviously, those 2 cases are magically different.p  pWho can explain, why they are different bug, feature, deep insight, ... and if there is a simple rule one can adopt which prevents wasting time over such issues now and thenp

Three times if its the 3rd time, etc. p  pI speculate that the table variable is part of the closure formed by the function because even if I set table  null the same thing happens.p  pHow can I prevent thisp  pstrongDataTables Functionstrongp  precodeCreate a DataTable on tableElementID using pageUrl as the source     function ajaxLoadTable  pageUrl, tableElementID            window.table  tableElementID              .on init.dt, function               The success function is used internally so it should NOT be overwritten, have to listen for this event instead             Add our custom fields length refers to an element generated datatables                                                            if  additionalElements.saveButton                       tableElementID  length.afterltdiv classdataTablesfiltergtltbuttongtSave All Editsltbuttongtltdivgt                                   if  additionalElements.selectState                       tableElementID  length.afterltdiv classdataTablesfiltergtltlabelgtProject State ltselect nameprojectState stylewidthautogtltoptiongtSelect ...ltoptiongtltoption valueActivegtActiveltoptiongtltoption valueHistoricalgtHistoricalltoptiongtltselectgtltlabelgtltdivgt                                   if  additionalElements.searchBox                       tableElementID  length.afterltdiv classdataTablesfiltergtltlabelgtSearchltinput typesearch idcustomSearch stylewidthautogtltlabelgtltdivgt                                              .DataTable                          processing true,                         serverSide true,                         ajax                             type POST,                             url pageUrl,                             data  function  additionalData                                           .serverData.each function index, element                                              if element.nodeName  SELECT                                               additionalData[element.name.toUpperCase]   element.options[element.selectedIndex].value                                               return true return true is equivalent to continue for .each                                                                                          additionalData[element.name.toUpperCase]  element.value                                                                              ,                             dataType json                                                             ,                           pageLength 4,                          lengthMenu [ 4, 8, 12, 16, 24 ],                          searchDelay 1500,                          columnDefs                                             targets 0,                                              orderable false,                                                  data                                                      display                                                                                                          codepre  pstrongDestruction Functionstrongp  precodeLoad the selected project state     html.on change , [nameprojectState] ,function         var currentState  optionselected, this.val          projectState.valcurrentState      Remove the old table records and the datatables.

So, for instance, inp  precodemyObj   name  Charlie, getType  function  return typeofthis    console.logmyObj.getType  codepre  pthe object invoking the function codegetTypecode is codemyObjcode and therefore codetypeofthiscode is codetypeofmyObjcode.p  pWhy, then, do I always see codethiscode inside jQuery functions For instance, inp  precode.nottallerthan50pixels.eachfunction       if this.height gt 50 this.height50  codepre  pdoesnt code.nottallerthan50pixelscode return an array of jQuery objects and so inside the codeeachcode the invoking function is a jQuery object and so codethiscode would refer to that jQuery object and I can simply write codeif this.height gt 50 this.height50code p

The line number xyz is doing something like thisp  precodervar1,rvar2  methodThatReturnsMultipleValuesparam1,param2 codepre  pI debugged the code and found that codemethodThatReturnsMultipleValuescode returns code[false,false]code, something like thisp  precodemethodThatReturnsMultipleValuesdef param1,def param2      ...     return [false,false]     codepre  pHowever when I step out of the method while debugging the line number xyz gives above exception. According to groovy, this should assign both codervar1code and codervar2code to codefalsecode. I tried to replicate the exception on smaller code like thisp  precodeclass TempClass      static maindef args               boolean bvar1  false          boolean bvar2  false          bvar1, bvar2  returnMultipleValues          println bvar1          println bvar2           static private returnMultipleValues              boolean a  false         boolean b  false         return [a, b]       codepre  pHowever, unfortunately above code works perfect and correctly prints codefalsecode twice. So am not able to replicate the issue on small code. Surprisingly, when I change the line xyz top  precodedef a  methodThatReturnsMultipleValuesparam1,param2 codepre  pcodeacode gets assigned with codetruecode and continues in desired manner, given that I am testing for scenarios in which codervar1code and codervar2code will not be used. Its only when I change back the line xyz to p  precodervar1,rvar2  methodThatReturnsMultipleValuesparam1,param2 codepre  pthe error pops up again, failing scenarios where codervar1code and codervar2code will be used.p  pI am just lost with direction where should I be looking for. Especially that codejava.lang.Boolean.getAtcode is not making me much sense.p  pPS I know only explaining the behavior of code as I observe might not be completely helpful to resolve my query, and I should be giving the full code so that others can also observe more stuff, but honestly my code is not easy to make standalone, I mean directly callable from codemaincode. So let me know if I should take extra effort to really make it callable from codemaincode and really replicate the issue on as small code as possible. But before that I will really appreciate any blind guesses towards resolving this.p

Positive 1680 pstrongTLDRstrongp  pNontrivial memory leak, can be seen easily in Resharper. See minimal example below.p  hr  pIm seeing a memory leak in the following program but failing to see why. p  pThe program sends pings to a number of hosts asynchronously and determines if at least one is ok. To do that, a method codeSendPingcode that runs these async operations is repeatedly called which runs them in a background thread it doesnt have to, but in the actual application codeSendPingcode will be called by the main UI thread which shouldnt be blocked. p  pThe task seems pretty trivial but I think the leak occurs due to the way I create lambdas inside the codeSendPingcode method. The program can be changed to not use lambdas but Im more interested in understanding what causes the leak here.p  precodepublic class Program       static string[] hosts   www.google.com, www.facebook.com       static void SendPing              int numSucceeded  0         ManualResetEvent alldone  new ManualResetEventfalse          ManualResetEvent[] handles  new ManualResetEvent[hosts.Length]         for int i  0 i lt hosts.Length i             handles[i]  new ManualResetEventfalse          BackgroundWorker worker  new BackgroundWorker         worker.DoWork  sender, args gt                      numSucceeded  0             Actionltint, boolgt onComplete  hostIdx, succeeded gt                              if succeeded Interlocked.Incrementref numSucceeded                 handles[hostIdx].Set                           for int i  0 i lt hosts.Length i                 SendPingi, onComplete              ManualResetEvent.WaitAllhandles                   worker.RunWorkerCompleted  sender, args gt                      Console.WriteLineSucceeded   numSucceeded             BackgroundWorker bgw  sender as BackgroundWorker             alldone.Set                   worker.RunWorkerAsync         alldone.WaitOne         worker.Dispose           static void SendPingint hostIdx, Actionltint, boolgt onComplete              Ping pingSender  new Ping         pingSender.PingCompleted  sender, args gt                      bool succeeded  args.Error  null ampamp args.Cancelled ampamp args.Reply  null ampamp args.Reply.Status  IPStatus.Success             onCompletehostIdx, succeeded             Ping p  sender as Ping             p.Dispose                   string data  aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa         byte[] buffer  Encoding.ASCII.GetBytesdata         PingOptions options  new PingOptions64, true         pingSender.SendAsynchosts[hostIdx], 2000, buffer, options, hostIdx           private static void Mainstring[] args              for int i  0 i lt 1000 i                      Console.WriteLineSend ping   i             SendPing                codepre  pResharper shows the leaks are due to uncollected closure objects codecDisplayClass...code. p  pa hrefhttpi.stack.imgur.comHhBJt.png relnofollowimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comHhBJt.png altenter image description herea a hrefhttpi.stack.imgur.comki1T5.png relnofollowimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comki1T5.png altenter image description hereap  pFrom what I understand, there shouldnt be a leak because there are no circular references as far as I see and therefore GC should take of the leaks.

Negative 1680 pI have a tabBarController with two tabs, first of which contains an instance of NavigatorController.  The navigatorController is initiated with a custom viewController peersViewController that list all the network peers on a tableView.  Upon selecting a peer, an instance of FilesListViewController  which list files in the c directory is pushed into the navigationController stack.  p  pIn this filesListViewController I have a button to let it navigate to say documents directory.  To do this Id wired the interface to call a gotoDirectoryNSStringpath method in the rootViewControllerp  precode voidgotoDirectoryNSStringpath       [[self navigationController] popToRootViewControllerAnimatedYES]      NSArray files  [self getFilesFromPeerAtPathpath]      FilesListViewController filesVC  [[FilesListViewController alloc] initWithFilesfiles]      [[self navigationController] pushViewControllerfilesVC animatedYES]      [filesVC release]  codepre  pHowever, when I press that button, the navigationController did pop my view to the root view controller, but then the FilesListViewController that I instantiated did not appear.  From the log, I know that the custom initWithFiles method was indeed called and network stuffs did happen to get the file names.p  pSomething else is screwy about this.  I tried clicking on the second tab and then click back to the first tab, and huala the file names I needed are there.  It looks like the data and the filesListViewController was indeed pushed into the navigatorController stack, but the display was not refreshed but stuck at the screen of rootViewController peersViewController.p  pAm I doing anything wrongp  pBen.p  p Edited like 15 minutes after posting the question.  Id found a workaround, but it bothers me that pop and then push doesnt work.p  precode voidgotoDirectoryNSStringpath       PeersListViewController rootViewController  PeersListViewController[[[self navigationController] viewControllers] objectAtIndex0]      [[self navigationController] setViewControllers[NSArray arrayWithObjectrootViewController]]      FilesListViewController filesVC  [[FilesListViewController alloc] initWithFilesfiles]      [[self navigationController] pushViewControllerfilesVC animatedYES]      [filesVC release]  codepre  pIt doesnt seem like the navigationController should be circumvented this way, and Id probably have to release all the viewControllers that were in the original stack.  This does however work on the iphone 3.0 simulator. p  pIf Im using this code though, how should the memory release be handled should I get the original NSArray of viewcontrollers and release everythingp
Negative 1680 pWe have a WPF application that has custom windows on a canvas which in turn contain custom controls the main canvas containing the custom windows is again custom control displaying stuff.

To show the dragampdrop adorner an adorned element and an adorner layer is needed.

Negative 1680 pI am  in the process of switching over from DataTable to BindingList. I bind the DataTable to the DataGrid object.p  pHere my dilemma while I certainly see the advantages of switching over, my circumstances will make it a bit complex and I am wondering whether it is worth it to switch over.p  pMy scenario I have a DataGrid which displays chemical samples. There are 5 kinds of sample type, where the columns in the grid will differ for each type and sometimes within the same type based on other parameters. Some columns remain the same, some are present in 3 types, some in 4 etc etc. Not exactly a case of simple inheritance. Currently, I have a DataTable which makes it easy since I can load whichever columns I want without having to have properties for each sample type which is what I will have to do if I use BindingList. But then, BindingList will make it much easier down the road to refer to sample properties.p  pThis is my first experience with this object BindingList so any suggestions welcome. From what I know BindingList binds to properties. So if I havep  precodepublic class Sample      protected string mseq     protected string mid     protected string mweight     protected string munits      public Sample                public string Seq              get  return mseq          set  mseq  value            public string Id              get  return mid          set  mid  value            public string Weight              get  return mweight          set  mweight  value            public string Units              get  return munits          set  munits  value         end of class codepre  pThe grid will be bound to the properties of Sample class if I have something likep  precodeBindingList samples  new BindingListltSamplegt codepre  pWhich means I am going to have 6 types of samples, all with properties defined.

The structures of the entities are as followsp  precodepublic abstract class EntityltTEntity, TIdgt     where TEntity  EntityltTEntity, TIdgt      public virtual TId Id  get protected set      public override bool Equalsobject obj...     ...   public class EntityAltEntityA, longgt  EntityltEntityA, longgt      public virtual EntityB B  get private set       ...    public class EntityBltEntityA, longgt  EntityltEntityB, longgt       ...   codepre  pIn my model, every EntityA must contain exactly one EntityB, and every EntityB that exists is there to be part of an EntityA. Its a common strongonetoone relationshipstrong.p  pNow, to the mappingsp  precodepublic class EntityAMap  ClassMapltEntityAgt      public EntityAMap              Idx gt x.Id         HasOnex gt x.B             .Cascade.All          ...         public class EntityBMap  ClassMapltEntityBgt      public EntityBMap              Idx gt x.Id             .GeneratedBy.ForeignId          ...        codepre  pThen I create an EntityA, that creates by itself an EntityB. Then when I save itp  precodevar entityA  EntityAFactory.CreateNewValidEntityA session.SaveOrUpdateentityA codepre  pstrongNHibernate throws an exception, Unable to resolve property Id.strongp  pHowever, my log shows that an EntityA was inserted into the DB, and by debugging, I can see that EntityA.Id was attributed a value ie, nhibernate did a good job saving entityA, retrieving the Id generated by the DB and setting the entityA.Id property accordingly.p  pHowever, no entityB was created empty database, and log shows nothing. So, it looks to me that NHibernate had problems to access this property, when saving EntityB, through the GeneratedBy.ForeignId definition. Maybe its because the property Id is not directly a property of EntityA, but from EntityBase, however what I did looks correct to me.p  pWhere is the problem How can I solve itp  pThanksp  pEDIT Here I show some of the stack trace, if it might help.

Negative 1680 pWhere in the solutionprojects, should I put the models for the data access layer. For example, if I have a login module that needs to use a Users table in a database, and I have a User.cs model. Where would that file go. If other modules need to be able to access this User.cs for information, then I cannot put it in the module. But then I fail to see how this can remain loosely coupled.p

Negative 1680 pI have got a Windows Service class  inherits from ServiceBase  which at construction time is  provided with a List of objects. Each Operation describes a DoWork virtual method.br The point of of the Service class is to manage all the underlying Operations, addremove them to the List at runtime and execute their DoWork method in a ThreadPool thread.br Each Operation has a System.Timers.Timer object which is instantiated and run with the Operation class. Each Operation exposes up an event to signal the managing class that its own timer is up and it has to fire its own DoWork method in a thread.p  pThe TimedService class binds each elapsed timer event to a method that requests a thread from the pool  p  precodeprivate void CheckOperationsListobject source, EventArgs e   try        foreach Operation op in this.operationsList            lock this.operationsList                op.TimerElapsed  new Operation.ElapsedEventHandlerthis.RequestThreadFromPool                  catch Exception ex  this.ManEV.WriteErrorthis.serviceName, ex.Message     codepre  pAnd of course, the RequestThreadFromPoolobject sender, EventArgs e method does the following thing  p  precode    ThreadPool.QueueUserWorkItemnew WaitCallbackOperationsender.DoWork, new object   codepre  pI am receiving weird behavior from the processes. I have tried to implement a dummy Operation with a timer set to 10 seconds which simply keeps the processor occupied for a couple of seconds  p  precodefor Int16 i  0 i lt Int16.MaxValue i        for short j  0 j lt short.MaxValue j            codepre  pEvery time an Operation runs alone in the queue  I pass a List of only one element to the Service  everything is normal. The process spawns its own thread, keeps the CPU up for a couple of seconds, then leaves.  p  pI implemented a lighter version of the dummy method above  basically the same without the inner loop  to simulate a lightweight thread.p  pAs soon as I get two or more operations in the queue  with different timers  all the threads spawn three or four times and then everything stops.br I get no activity at all. In Visual Studio it looks like the Timer of each Operation has stopped ticking  I get no calls to the event, I get no calls to the delegate that is supposed to handle the event each Operation class has its own timer and always refer to the timer via this.   p  pI tried monitoring all the catches, and tried wrapping each DoWork method in a try , but I am getting no exceptions.p  pWhat is puzzling me is that if I run several identical Operations  i.e. two or three long operations or two or three short ones  everything runs as normal. Looks like as the Event comes from another class, everything gets messed up.p  pI am starting to think that the System.Timers.Timer class is the cause of all the above  I have tried calling Stop to the timer right before calling the Event, but to no avail. I get 45 iterations of each Operations DoWork method and then everything quites down. p  pemeditem I forgot to clarify Each Operation I run is inherited from the base Operation. I.e  p  precodepublic class TestLongOperation  Operation    public TestLongOperationdouble secondsInterval  basesecondsInterval     public override void Workobject buh        for Int16 i  0 i lt Int16.MaxValue i            for short j  0 j lt short.MaxValue j             codepre  pp  pAny suggestions I can provide more code if the above is not sufficient.

Negative 1680 pI am currently working on a project where I am trying to detect a few coins lying on a flat surface i.e. a desk. The coins do not overlap and are not hidden by other objects. But there might be other objects visible and the lighting conditions may not be perfect... Basically consider yourself filming your desk which has some coins on it.p  pSo each point should be visible as an Ellipse. Since I dont know the position of the camera the shape of the ellipses may vary, from circle view from top to flat ellipses depending on the angle the coins are filmed from.p  pMy problem is that I am not sure on how to extract the coins and finally fit ellipses over them which I am looking for to do further calculations.p  pFor now I have just made a first attempt by setting a threshold value in OpenCV, using findContours to get the contour lines and fitting an ellipse. Unfortunately the contour lines only rarely give me the shape of the coins reflections, bad lighting, ... and this way is also not preferred since I dont want the user to set any threshold.p  pAnother idea was to use a template matching method of an ellipse on that image, but since I dont know the angle of the camera nor the size of the ellipses I dont think this would work well...p  pSo I wanted to ask if anybody could tell me a method that would work in my case... p  pstrongIs there a fast way to extract the three coins from the image The calculations should be made in realtime on mobile devices and the method should not be too sensitive for different or changing lights or the color of the background.strongp  pWould be great if anybody could give me any tips on which method could work for me...p

My understanding is that Python will read one line, apply each function in turn, and write the result to the output, and then it will read the second line only emafterem sending the first line to the output, so that the second line does not enter the pipeline until the first one has exited. Do I understand correctly how this program will flow If this is how it works, is there any easy way to make it so that multiple lines can be in the pipeline at once, so that the program is reading, writing, and processing each step in parallelp

Negative 1680 pHeres the problem.  I run a query in SQL Server Management Studio.  I click Save results As... and save the file as CSV.  When I open the CSV file with Notepad or any text editor, trailing spaces have been added on every column to make them a uniform width.  This is extremely frustrating, because when I open the file with Excel, it autoconverts the fields into columns, changing account numbers and such to scientific notation.p  pWith SQL Server 2005, there are no trailing spaces added, so Excel just puts all the data in a single column.  Then I can convert text to columns and specify every column to be Text.  But my company has switched me to SQL Server 2008 and now the only way to get the correct formatting is to import the CSV into Access, run Trim functions in Access and thus change the field names to get rid of the spaces, then export from Access to Excel.  PLEASE HELP  Why the heck is SQL Server 2008 adding trailing spaces and where is the option to make it stopp  pSOLVED Please see my answer below.p

Negative 1680 pIve got some browser tests that run using Watir webdriver and FXDriver and things are generally working ok. However there is one test that loads a lightbox that contains a lot of HTML, and when the tests open this lightbox, Firefox shows a popup complaining that Utils.js line 432 from FXDriver has become an unresponsive script and the test times out.

Second query uses indexed view, and performs great, and the first query denies to use it, using indexes on tables instead. I repeat myself  both queries are the same, to the same table, at the same server, they differs only by number in top part.  I tried to force optimizer to use indexed view in the first query by updating statistics, destroing indexes it used and so on.

Negative 1680 pI use forkexecwait rather than system when the command has user input as some of its arguments so the user cant put something like...p  precodeamprm rf home ampamp echo HAHA codepre  p... as an argument.p  pIm assuming popen is as dangerous as system because it takes a single string and not a list of strings like the exec family of functions do.p  pI can only get the return value from the exec functions though.  Is there a safe version of popen that I can run with user input and process stdout  stderr back in the parent processp

Negative 1680 pI like to pop out results in a window so that theyre easier to see and find e.g., they dont get lost as the console continues to scroll.  One way to do this is to use codesinkcode and codefile.showcode.  For example  p  precodey lt rnorm100 x lt rnorm100 mod lt lmyx sinktempSink, typeoutput summarymod sink file.showtempSink, delete.fileT, titleModel summary codepre  pI commonly do this to examine model fits, as above, but also for a wide variety of other functions and objects, such as codesummarydata.framecode, codeanovamodel1, model2code, codetablefactor1, factor2code.  These are common, but other situations can arise as well.  The point here is that both the nature of the function and the object can vary.  p  pIt is somewhat tedious to type out all of the above every time.  I would like to write a simpler function that I can call, something like the following would be nice  p  precodesinkShow lt functionobj, fun, titleoutput      sinktempSink, typeoutput     applyobj, , fun     sink     file.showtempSink, delete.fileT, titletitle  codepre  pClearly, this doesnt work.  There are several issues.  First, how would you do this so that it wont crash with the wrong type of object or function without having to have a list of conditional executions i.e., codeifis.listobj  lapply...code.  Second, Im not sure how to handle the codemargincode argument.  Lastly, this doesnt work even when I try simple, contrived examples where I know that everything is set appropriately, so there seems to be something fundamentally wrong.  p  pDoes anyone know how such a situation can be handled simply and easily  Im not new to R, but Ive never been formally taught it Ive picked up tricks in an adhoc manner, i.e., Im not a very sophisticated R programmer.  Thanks.p

However Ive now identified what appear to be some weaknesses with this approach, for example if there is a need to pass around some auxillary data e.g. objects that cannot be encoded in forms like BufferedImages, metadata useful for optimisation etc..p  pIm sure this is a solved problem in the Lisp world  What would typically be the best intermediate representation for this kind of DSLp

Historically there is a finite number of overlaps 6 is the current max, but it would be possible to have more.p  pCurrently, I do this type of analysis in Excel, with a helper column that compares the current record with previous records to determine if theres an overlap or how many and it works ok, but it seems like I should be able to accomplish this strictly within SQL.p  pEDIT  Heres a sample from Excel, but the data is held in a single, SQL table.  I have admin priveleges for the database, so I can implement just about any solutionexcept changing the database structure its a COTS system.  Ive included the formula for the overlap column.

Negative 1680 pI have a javascript routine that grabs an XML stream via AJAX and then parses it. It works fine in FF and Chrome but in IE 9, if there are consecutive Line Feeds within a node, IE compresses them into a space and one line feed.p  pSpecifically, where retNode is an xml node, retNode.text has the compressed white space in IE, but includes all the characters in FF and Chrome.p  pI have tried writing my own routine to parse the XML, but that seems fragile and a waste of time. I tried using the PreserveWhitespace property, but that does not seem to be available in javascript. I tried using retNode.nodeValue instead of retNode.text, but nodeValue had no value.p  pId prefer a solution that does not use jquery because I dont know jquery, and I am not sure what other code I would need to add to make jquery work.p  pThanks in advancep

Negative 1680 pSuppose I have a constructor for an object that takes about 6 parameters, but two or more of the parameters are related, for example p  precodeLoanProductCurrencySum maxSum, CurrencySum minSum, Interest interest, etc codepre  pstrongCurrencySumstrong is a wrapper for two objects a emBigDecimalem and an emEnumem representing currencies.p  pstrongIntereststrong is an interface with two sublasses strongFixedIntereststrong and strongVariableIntereststrong.p  pstrongVariableIntereststrong wraps a emBigDecimalem representing a fixed value and an strongVarIndexstrong object that is the varying bit of the interest  VarIndex is basically libor 1m, libor 2m, etc VariableInterest  BigDecimal fixedValue  VarIndex variableValuep  pNow, the bit that annoys me is that when a strongLoanProductstrong is created, I have to check in the constructor if emmaxSumem and emminSumem are of the same strongCurrencystrong, and if strongVariableIntereststrong holds a strongVarIndexstrong corresponding to that strongCurrencystrong, as  a LoanProduct in euros cant have a VarIndex set for libor, it has to be euribor.p  pIs there an elegant way to construct the LoanProduct without all this checking  Im considering using the builder pattern and make all the checks in the builder, but it still seems ugly.p

For each row of the cursor, some but not all of the fields need to be inserted into another table called LineItem, and in addition to this I need to take the total of all those rows in the cursor and create a parent row in an Invoice table.p  pWould it be easier to read the cursor back into the Java app, then iterate over its contents performing INSERTS as necessary, or is it possible to do all of this within the same Stored Procedure I am thinking multiple stored procedures should be used to avoid complexity, but am not sure if this can be done and for it all to remain as part of one transaction.p  pI am trying to avoid creating a super complex Stored Proc, but dont want a dreadful solution either.p  pThanksp

Negative 1680 pIm working with XCode 4.5. For my current project, I need to build an UI element similar to a textfield. Because I will have to reuse this custom element in a whole bunch of ViewControllers, Im looking for a way to build this custom textfield in such a way that I can use it for drag amp drop in the XCode interface builder, instead of adding it only programmatically thats what I found so far.p  pHow can I achieve this emIm looking for a tutorial that explains the whole process in a simple example project.emp  pstrongSpecificationstrongp  pThe result Im going for is having a custom UIView that I can use just like every other predefined UI element such as a textfield. That means I want to be able to drag amp drop it from the object library into some controller in my storyboard, edit its attributes, especially the custom ones,  with the attributes inspector and get visual feedback about that changes in IB. I dont want to subclass predefined UIViews over and over again, for two reasonsp  ol liFirst, adding custom a subclass to predefined UI elements means more work, since I need to repeat that over and over again for every single element I need to customize. More or less the whole visual part of my app will be build of custom UI elements to match a certain design I have to implement for my client.li liSecond and more important, I literally dont get the picture how my UI will finally appear if I build the biggest part of it programmatically by customizing its appearance in subclasses that should hold custom functionality.li liFinally, I consider it a bad coding practice to break the beautiful MVC separation the iOS SDK provides by generating static UI parts of my program that will never change at runtime programmatically in the controller part.li ol  pThis is why I need to design a custom UI element lets call its corresponding class UITextFieldCustom that I can use in the process of designing the UI like any other premade library object such as a textfield. Is that possiblep

Negative 1680 pIm writing an app that needs to overwrite a readonly file. Specifically the etchosts file. To do that I need to ask for permission from the user to get root access and thereby permission to overwrite the hosts file.p  pI have searched all over the internet, but I have not been able to understand how to do this. I realize that a method called AuthorizationExecuteWithPrivileges used to be used for this, but that it is deprecated in OSX 10.7.

Negative 1680 pThe site Im modifying is www.fashiontogo.cap  pPlease view the source code via Google Chromes ability to view source as I cant provide the HTML or the CSS directly here. It isnt my site, and I didnt develop it from scratch. Look at the profile picture in the top right, or any of the images on the page. Youll see a 1px left border there is a margin associated with the profile picture, but not the others. That needs to be removed. p  pThe CSS file Ive been provided for the site does not contain anything causing this. Ive tried removing all instances in the CSS that are either border or borderleft and nothing has changed. The only possible thing that Ive been able to do is to remove the surrounding div element for the images named .imgcontainer. A hack fix that Id rather avoid would be to use jQuery to dynamically remove all the imgcontainer divs at load time, but Id much rather find some CSS fix to this.p  pAny suggestions or ideas Any help would be appreciated.p
Negative 1680 pIve seen a lot about doing this in CSS far from ideal, but Im thinking of building a Chrome extension and it requires that a div is inserted prior to another for clarification, I mean that when testing the extension I need to drag the div above the other using Chrome Dev Tools. Is there a way to do this upon page load using JavascriptJQuery or some other way which can be done via Chrome Extension p  pIn previous attempts Ive tried using codeinsertAftercodecodeinsertBeforecode and codebeforecode and had no luck although I might be missing something obvious, so I guess another question is do these need to be used in a certain way within a Chrome Extension p  pThanks in advance for any helpp

I noticed that sometimes the InnerException is different. Sounds like a threading problem, but it is strange that it works without futures. But Im not using threads for loading the data, just for adding items hmm, but maybe, because I notify when my items are added, and I load the items in answer to that message, I think that load would be executed in another threadp  pEDIT 2 The error seems pretty random.

Negative 1680 pI believe this is similar to the thread a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions13637670canonedsdk211onosxedsopensessionexcbadaccessCanon SDK 2.11 on OSXap  pHowever the solution there did not work for me.  Im perplexed because Im not sure how to figure out what has changed.  I had some working software, did not work on it over the holiday and now when I open it up to work it fails.  Not only my software but the demo app included with the SDK, which I have never changed and indeed used to work just fine.p  pI have tried with two different cameras 5DmII and 5DmIII with the same result.p  pwhen I try and run the application, the camera is recognized but, as it attempts to open a session it receives a EXCBADACCESS signal.  In each program it happens when a call is made to EdsOpenSession with this message...p  pemem [NSConcreteData release] message sent to deallocated instance 0x8157af0p  pInterestingly, when I tried to use the EOS Utility that would crash also.  So I updated and now that works great.  I followed the suggestion in the above thread and copied the EDSDK.framework from the working bundle to my program and recompiled but I get the same results.p  pIm trying to figure out how to contact Canon to get some information but they dont make it easy to get help so Im appealing to the one group I know is responsive.p  pThe only thing I can think is that sometime over the holiday I updated some critical library without knowing it.p  pHas anyone else run into and been able to solve this p  pIm running OS X 10.7.5, xcode 4.1, and EDSDK 2.11.3p

Negative 1680 pIm trying to use static .html pages for a website that encounters large traffic spikes. The website is an codeMVC3code app. The static .html pages are in a directory structure something like the followingp  precodeapproot content         index.html     staticpages             page1.html             page2.html             page3.html codepre  pIve set the defaultDocument in codeweb.configcode to codecontentindex.htmlcode. If I simply include the .html files in the project and deploy the app, it runs fine.p  pWhat we want to do is put all of the html files as blobs in a storage container. A background task run in WebRole checks for any updated files at a regular interval. The background task also checks to see if the .html files exist or need updating when the servers starts up. Ideally, wed rather not have to include the .html files in the project and just grab them from storage when the server starts.p  pThe background task pulls down the files and puts them in the proper directories just fine. However, when trying to access the website at say www.mysite.com, IIS returns a code403code error. If we try to access any of the other .html pages we get a code404code error. This does not occur when testing the codeMVCcode app in a local development environment. p  pWhen I turn on directory browsing in codeIIScode, none of the files or the directories appear when getting a directory for the site. Once again using just the domain like www.mysite.com. p  pIf I do include the .html files in the codewebrolecode project and then try to update one in storage, the codeblobcode is pulled from storage, but codeIIScode serves up the old page. Ive deleted my browser cache to be sure that wasnt an issue. The new file is being updated correctly on the server. Ive copied it to my local machine and looked inside it and it is indeed the updated version.p  pSo, from what I can deduce so far it seems like codeAzure cachescode the entire website as it is deployed and doesnt seem to allow for content change. p  pIs there a way to force codeAzurecode to recognize the changes or are we going to be forced to redeploy whenever theres a change to a static .html page  p

Im close..p  pCode is below, explanation further below.p  precodevar activeTopic .posttest.php,              requestgetActiveSection,         courseidcourseid     ,     function data, status          if data  none              activeTopic  data             displayActiveTopic               alertactiveTopic codepre  pIm using Jquerys POST function to make a call to test.php. PHP takes the course ID and returns the currently active topic. The PHP code is returning the correct value. I know this, because if I alertdata, the correct value is displayed. p  pHowever, if I alertactiveTopic outside the function, I notice the global variable activeTopic hasnt changed. Whyp  pThanks in advance for the help. When I have some time, Im going to put a bunch more effort into learning JS. Its a lot of fun so far... very different from PHP, but fun nonetheless. p

Negative 1680 pI have weekdate data in the form codeyyyywwcode where codewwcodeis the week number in two digits. The data span code200701code to code201030code. The week counting convention is ISO 8601, which as you can see here a hrefhttpen.wikipedia.orgwikiWeeknumberWeeknumberingon Wikipedias Week number articlea, occasionally reaches 53 weeks in a year. For example 2009 had 53 weeks by this system, see the week numbers in a hrefhttpwww.timeanddate.comcalendarcustom.htmlyear2009ampmonth1ampmonths12ampcountry1amptyp2ampdf1this ISO 8601 calendara. See other years as per the Wikipedia article, 53rd weeks are fairly rare.p  pBasically I want to read the week date in, convert it to a codeDatecode object and save this to a separate column in a codedata.framecode. As a test, I reconverted the codeDatecode objects to codeyyyywwcode formats by codeformat[Dateobject], format  YWcode, and this threw up an error at code200953code. That week fails to be interpreted as a date by codeRcode. This is very odd, as other years which do emnotem have a 53rd week in ISO 8601 standard are converted fine, such as code200753code, whereas other years that also do not have a 53rd week in ISO 8601 standard also fail, such as code200853codep  pThe following minimal example demonstrates the issue. p  pMinimal examplep  precodedates lt c200950, 200951, 200952, 200953, 201001, 201002 as.Datex  pastedates, 1, format  YW w  [1] 20091214 20091221 20091228 NA           20100104  [6] 20100111  other.dates lt c200753, 200853, 200953, 201053 as.Datex  pasteother.dates, 1, format  YW w  [1] 20071231 NA           NA           NA      codepre  pThe question is, how do I get codeRcode to accept week numbers in ISO 8601 formatp  pNote This question summarises a problem I have been struggling with for a few hours.

Negative 1680 pI had a Delphi 6 application with a 16x16 icon. Recently I made the 64x64 version of it and recompiled the application.p  pThis highresolution icon is displayed on Windows 7 Superbar and in task manager when I run the application. It is displayed in .exe file properties.p  pBut when I make a shortcut on desktop, it shows me a stretched lowresolution icon 16x16. When I go to this shortcuts properties  it shows me the 64x64 version. To display the High resolution icon on the shortcut I have to go to shortcut icons properties, click on the only hires icon available, click Ok and apply and do this sequence twice.p  pIf I delete the shortcut and try to create it again, it shows the 16x16 icon again until I assign the icon twice.p  pI have specially looked into .res file  there is only one icon.p  pI have cleared icons cache, logged out and logged in. Still no change of behaviour. Such a behaviour is reproducible  on other computer with Windows 7.p  pI have no idea what is happening. Is it making the lowresolution version from highresolution or it has cached the previous version somewherep

The key is unique. The salt is different for each password.p  pEvery time you call CRYPTpassword you get a LazyCrypt object. This object can be serialized into a string. The string you get is always different because it contains a random salt. You cannot compare two of those strings because you always get false, even for the same password. Yet you can compare a LazyObject with a string and the lazy object will use the same algorithm and the same salt from the string to compute the hash and compare it with the hash in the string.

It has a cool extension method strongAfterClosingDostrong, which runs a coroutine after that child was deactivated and closed.p  pHowever, when I run another ConductResult using codeAfterClosingDocode, basically this happensp  ul lifirst child VMis closedli liDeactivated event occurs, ConductResult runs AfterClosing actionli liin AfterClosing, I open second child VM using ConductResult in parent Conductorli lisecond child VM is properly activatedli lihowever, the deactivation of first child VM still isnt completed, and strongnullstrong item is set as active in the Conductorli ul  pFirst VM basically shows progress of a load operation, second VM shows actual data.

Negative 1680 pIt is not a strictly programming question, but knowing hardware is the critical part of programming.p  pSo I start this thread, hope people here can share their experience in  programming on Kepler GK10X or GK110.p  pFirst I start minep  pI am doing some programming on GK110 at the moment, for some applications, GK110 is significantly faster than a Fermi, close to its theortical peak e.g. 2.53X faster. But for others, it isnt, e.g. only  5060 faster.p  pCorret me if I am wrong, but it seems to me, the main performance bottleneck of Kepler is resource pressure is very high herep  pOn a perSM level, Fermi actually have far more resources comparing to GK110, on each SM, Fermi only has one SIMT unit, whilst Kepler has 6.p  pYet on each SM,  Fermi has 32K registers file, a maximum of 1536 active threads, whilst on each SM of Kepler, there are only 33 more active threads, 100 more registers, with 800 insturctionissue units, and same amount of L1 cache.p  pThe latencies regarding memory and computation are about the same in absolute terms half in terms of GPU cycles.p  pSo resourcepressure is much higher on GK110, comparing to GF110.p  pWith 800 of instructionissue units, it seems that Nvidia want to use more aggressive TLP and ILP to hide latency on Kepler, but it is certainly not as flexible, since L1 cache is the same, and active threads is only increased by 33 instead of 500 like its SIMT units.p  pSo, to utilize maximum efficiency of Kepler, it is much harder,  first code has to contain significantly more ILP yet take singificantly less sharedmemory to take the advantage of a massive instructionissue unit of Kepler, seconldy, on a perwarp level, workflow has to be very computationally intensive such that Kepler schedule dont need to switch alot of warps to hide latency and it certainly dont have alot of avaiable warps to chose from to begin with.p

Negative 1680 pWhat are the pros and cons of using codeAzureServiceBusMessageQueuecode vs. codeAzureMessageQueuecodep  pI understand that there are differences between these 2 transport bindings on Azure alone, such as message size, concurrency, duplication behavior etc. However much of this is already being coordinated by NServiceBus or so I presume  because NServiceBus documentation is very scarce on the subject. NServiceBus itself allows you to store the payload in a blob storage.p  pSo then what are the pros and cons of using one as opposed to the other Im mostly concerned about the performance, scalability, payload limitation, flexibility to move solution on and off premise and cost.p

Negative 1680 pIm now using codeQGraphicsViewcode and codeQGraphicsScenecode for showing some charts. Depending on values of that charts they are histograms I change the scale. I also draw some text they are derived from codeQGraphicsItemcode for showing their values like thisp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comhsM0a.png altenter image description herep  pBut I dont scale texts like charts, so it brings to a problem. If I dont scale texts, so I get its bounding rects real coordinates. I want to get scale of y axis for drawing texts in right positions. p  pSo my question how may I get the scale in codeQGraphicsItemcode or in codeQGraphicsScenecode.p  pThank you in advance.p

Negative 1680 pOur company is a proud owner of a STM32f4 evaluation board  cortex M4F , We received another evaluation board that is ARM7TDMI board.p  pBefore starting the migration to the ARM7 evaluation board, we want to know if the hardware is strong enough for us,so we wont waste anytime to discover it later.p  pOur project utilize many DSP algorithms that takes advantage of the FPU , heavy usage of SDIO , and around 1 megabyte of memory  .p  pSo , i was thinking to do the following tests on both evaluation boards ,and see the performance differences  between them p  pMath  Addition , Subtraction,Division,Multiplication , Abs and Sqrtf  . It will run i a loop  and only floating numbers will be used. SDIO  readwrite a 2 kilobyte buffer in a loop Memory  readwrite to the external and internal RAM in a loop.p  pIn your opinion , do this results will give as any indication about the performance differences ,and what  to expect from the real project  p  pThanks Michaelp
Negative 1680 pMy Visiblox charts shrink to fit the available space, and sometimes the axis title gets shrunk so much it gets cut off.  So I figured I would just create a new ControlTemplate for the LinearAxis, using Blends starter code for the template.p  pI added a ViewBox around the AxisLabel textblock, but it wasnt working right.  Theres some interesting stuff you have to do with the Grid row and column, because the code needs to be generic enough to work on horizontal or vertical axes.  After a lot of trial and error, along with some external support, I have a working template that shrinks my Axis Title to fit the available space.  See answer below.p

Negative 1680 pIm trying to implement nonnegative matrix factorization using the KullbackLiebler divergence as a similarity measure. The algorithm is described in a hrefhttphebb.mit.edupeopleseungpapersnmfconverge.pdf relnofollowhttphebb.mit.edupeopleseungpapersnmfconverge.pdfa. Below is my python  numpy implementation, with an example matrix to run it on.p  pIn a nutshell, the algorithm is supposed to learn matrices Wn by r and Hr by m such that Vn by m is approximately WH. You start with random values in W and H, and by following the update rules described in the Seung and Lee paper, youre supposed to get closer and closer to good approximations for W and H. p  pThe algorithm is proven to monotonically reduce the divergence measure, but thats not what happens in my implementation. Instead, it settles into an alternation between two divergence values. If you look at W and H, you can see that the resulting factorization is not particularly good.p  pIve wondered whether to use the updated or old H when calculating the update for W. I tried it both ways, and it doesnt change the behavior of the implementation.p  pIve checked my implementation against the paper a bunch of times, and I dont see what Im doing wrong.

Negative 1680 pI am having some issues understanding how to implement the Resource Owners Password Flow with oAuth2rize and passport.js specifically with the transmission of the clientid and the clientsecret so that i can do some checks on the client to ensure anything coming into this end point token using the specific password grant type is specifically an official application and no others based on the id and secret.p  pWhen building out the solution i can get a token back, but that is before i have tried to do any validation on the client.  When i try and access the client variable posted to the end point passed into the password exchange strategy i receive the user credentials username, password which based on documentation is expected but not what i need to achieve here.p  pI am at a loss to understand how i get the actual client credentials, i can see in the password function source code you can provide additional options to override the default assignment to req[user] but does that mean i have to provide some sort of code to add to the req objectp  pI have setup some integration tests and here is how i am calling my endpoint using SuperTestp  precode                requesthttplocalhost43862                     .postoauthtoken                     .typeform                     .send granttype password                      .send clientid goodClient                      .send clientsecret asecret                      .send username gooduser.com                      .send password goodpassword                      .expect200, done codepre  pFor some reason i seem to be completely over thinking this but for some reason am completely stumped....p

Negative 1680 pwe have some issues with the native popover controller used on the ipad, maybe someone of you already found some workarounds.p  pIssue 1 Some of our Popovers used in a form have also a navigationcontroller embedded, so if we dismiss the popover after orientation change and show it again, all data would be lost. Surely we can store the data in a cache but this wouldnt be nice.p  pIssue 2 We are using a mapView which contains various annotations which are clustered for performance reasons by SuperPin Framework.

Negative 1680 pI am in processing of finalizing MVVM UI framework for few WPFC applications, which we are expected to kick start. Just to deliver the idea, these applications can generally be categorized into small  large based on some quantifiable weight eg. total number of screens and much more.p  pI presume to propose a hrefhttpcaliburnmicro.codeplex.com relnofollowCaliburn Microa for small and a hrefhttpcompositewpf.codeplex.com relnofollow PRISMa for the large category. The rationale behind this is to avoid heavy weight framework since these applications are low latency systems time bound and I am trying to cut short all corners which is overkill.p  pBut this is where I am stuck, as it is highly likely for an individual category to be elevated or lessen to other category. In such case, I might sometime end up having light framework for larger application when we elevate category from small to large or larger framework for small application when we lessen category from larger to small. I am not so confident to go with my approach two different type of framework since I had rely on two different framework to achieve this with have no flexibility of switching.p  pstrongQuestionstrong Is there any framework which has the elasticity to offload components, which i dont need in my application p

Negative 1680 pId like to define some functions for processing natural language text. Each of these functions adds some annotations to the text, e.g.p  precodeclass Annotationval begin Int, val end Int class Sentencebegin Int, end Int extends Annotationbegin, end class Tokenbegin Int, end Int extends Annotationbegin, end codepre  pSo I might have a Tokenizer function that adds Token annotations, a SentenceSegmenter function that adds Sentence annotations, etc. These functions have some constraints on the order in which they can be run. For example, the Tokenizer might require Sentence annotations, so it would have to be run after the SentenceSegmenter. In this case, Id like to get a compile error if I accidentally compose these functions in the wrong order. So codesentenceSegmenter andThen tokenizercode should compile, but codetokenizer andThen sentenceSegmentercode should not.p  pBelow is my attempt. I defined a special container type for the text, where the type parameter specifies via compound types what annotations have been added to the text, and then the functions specify their type parameters appropriately to ensure that they cant be run until their prerequisites are part of the compound type.p  precodetrait AnalyzedText[T]    def text String   def [U]annotations Iterator[U] AnalyzedText[T with U]    val begin AnalyzedText[Any] gt AnalyzedText[Any]  identity def sentenceSegmenter[T] AnalyzedText[T] gt AnalyzedText[T with Sentence]   def tokenizer[T lt Sentence] AnalyzedText[T] gt AnalyzedText[T with Token]     compiles val pipeline  begin andThen sentenceSegmenter andThen tokenizer  fails to compile  good val brokenPipeline  begin andThen tokenizer andThen sentenceSegmenter codepre  pSo far, so good. The problem arises when I try to actually define one of the functions. For example, Id like to define codetokenizercode something likep  precodedef tokenizer[T lt Sentence] AnalyzedText[T] gt AnalyzedText[T with Token]    text gt text  S.r.findAllMatchIntext.text.mapm gt new Tokenm.start, m.end codepre  pBut the Scala compiler cant figure out how to infer the type argument for the codecode method, and unless I manually specify the type parameter, codetext.[Token]...code, this produces the errorp  precodetype mismatch  found Iterator[Token]  required Iterator[Nothing] codepre  pIs there a way to get this type parameter to be inferred Or, alternatively, am I thinking about the problem wrong Is there a better way to capture these kinds of functioncomposition constraints in Scalap
Negative 1680 pIm trying to directly cast a stream of data into a structure that actually has a variable number of other structures as members.

Negative 1680 pI am learning how to program apps in ios.  Anyone out there know of a recent tutorial that shows how to push a new instance of a table view controller object on top of the stack without the need to create and hookup new nibp  pI found an old tutorial at iphone SDK Articles dated 32009. The website does not exist anymore as its domain expired. But the article, using a prepackaged 2009 NavigationBased Application in xcode, shows how to drill down a table using the same view controller rather than incorporate a new  nib file. In the article, the view controller is identified as a rootview controller. p  pI have managed to modify the code to populate the data from the plist to a table cell using a UIViewController class with UITableViewDelegate and UI TableViewDataSource.  This was not difficult to do.  However, my problems begin when a cell is activated with the didSelectRowAtIndexPath method.  The tutorials code creates a new instance of the same table view controller class, updates the cell data and pushes it to the top of the stack to effect the drill down.  When I apply the same method to my controller class, xcode throws an error.  Admittedly, my ignorance is the likely cause of the problem.  That is why I am looking for help.     p  pThe tutorial code implementing the didSelectRowAtIndexPathp  precodeRootViewController.m   voidtableViewUITableView tableView didSelectRowAtIndexPathNSIndexPath indexPath   Get the dictionary of the selected data source.

Negative 1680 pIn the past, whenever I create a custom table layout, I create the children views in java and then add them to the table using codetableRow.addViewchildViewcode. Presently, instead of creating all my children views by hand, I created them in xml and then inflate them into the tableRow.p  pSo for example I do p  precodeRelativeLayout gameView  RelativeLayout mInflater.inflateR.layout.mygame,             new RelativeLayoutcontext   edits to gameView gameView.requestLayout ViewGroup gameView.getParent.removeAllViews tableRow.addViewgameView addViewtableRow codepre  pMy problem however is this If I leave out the line codeViewGroup gameView.getParent.removeAllViewscode then I get an error that the view already has a parent and that I must first call coderevomeViewcode on the childs parent. Not able to find any method called coderemoveViewcode, I use coderemoveAllViewscode. But then when I do, I get a NullPointerException on the parent.p  pSo the question how do I inflate a view and then add it to a table layoutp

Negative 1680 pIm working on a project that involves hooking WSARecv. I know how to hook this function, I mean its just the same as hooking another function. Anyway the hard part is when WSARecv is used to perform overlapped operations. The idea is that when an application receives data to intercept that and be possible to modify this, Im using pipes for this. The native dll tunnels all data to a managed server. This processes the input etc and returns it back to the native dll. This works great for WSASend, send and recv. However the hard part is when an application uses overlapped sockets. So I need the received data first before I can process it, this is the hard part. How would I do something like this I thought of this, but they both seem like a messp  pWhen WSARecv is called using the WSAOverlapped Create a new thread, use WaitForSingleObject and pass the hEvent of the WSAOverlapped structure. When the event is signaled process the data to the managed server and pass the data to the program.p  pWhen WSARecv is called using the completion routine Create a new thread, modify the call to the original function with lpOperationCompleted to a new function. Use SleepEx to put the thread in an alertable state. When the OperationCompleted is called process the data and pass data back to the program.p  pemI could post my code but I didnt write because it seems like a bad solution.. So there is not really a point for that.emp  pI cannot think of a better solution and this seems horrible because when an application calls WSARecv a lot for example a large server using overlapped sockets to handle lots of clients it creates a new thread for every call and that just seems like a bad idea.p  pSo how can I do such thingp  pemPS If you think this is not a question, well it is because I dont know how to do this..emp

I tested the percentComplete variable from the BulkProcessor class, and this variable does in fact update as expected. So for some reason the thread is not fetching the update values using BulkProcessor.getPercentComplete the second time the thread is called. Anybody have any insight on this Any help is much appreciated.p

Negative 1680 pI have a service that is configured to handle a command object.  In the Handle method I am throwing an exception in specific business cases.  When this occurs it send the error to the Error queue and I think the Particular Management service is processing the Error queue.  It is my understanding is that the Particular Management service will monitor the Error queue and process the messages, that is to say, mine the metadata and persist it to RavenDB.  Lastly, it should forward the message to the Error.Log queue.  Regrettably, every message seems to get routed to the Service.Management.Errors queue.  Presumably, because the Particular Management service handler is failing.p  pIf I look the Extension Headers of the messages in the Service.Management.Errors queue, I see the following informationp  precodeltHeaderInfogt ltKeygtNServiceBus.ExceptionInfo.ExceptionTypeltKeygt ltValuegtSystem.NullReferenceExceptionltValuegt ltHeaderInfogt  ltHeaderInfogt ltKeygtNServiceBus.ExceptionInfo.MessageltKeygt ltValuegtObject reference not set to an instance of an object.ltValuegt ltHeaderInfogt  ltHeaderInfogt ltKeygtNServiceBus.ExceptionInfo.SourceltKeygt ltValuegtNServiceBus.CoreltValuegt ltHeaderInfogt  ltHeaderInfogt ltKeygtNServiceBus.ExceptionInfo.StackTraceltKeygt ltValuegtSystem.NullReferenceException Object reference not set to an instance of an object.              at NServiceBus.Unicast.Transport.TransportReceiver.ProcessMessage              TransportMessage       message in cTeamCitybuildAgentworkd4de8921a0aabf04srcNServiceBus.CoreUnicastTransportTransportReceiver.csline 357 codepre  pat NServiceBus.Unicast.Transport.TransportReceiver.TryProcessTransportMessage message in cTeamCitybuildAgentworkd4de8921a0aabf04srcNServiceBus.CoreUnicastTransportTransportReceiver.csline 235    at NServiceBus.Transports.Msmq.MsmqDequeueStrategy.Action in cTeamCitybuildAgentworkd4de8921a0aabf04srcNServiceBus.CoreTransportsMsmqMsmqDequeueStrategy.csline 170      p  pSince the ServiceInsight Particular Management service is presumably supposed to be generic in nature, I would assume that it does not need to know about the actual types of messages.

Negative 1680 pI have few general questions concerning android.support.v4.view.ViewPager. For my app I set as min sdk version 14.

Negative 1680 pIm reviewing some legacy code and came across a snippet which seems like it will throw unwanted exceptions.  In essence the code an EntityFramework query looks like the followingp  precodevar serviceId  Guid person.Services.FirstOrDefaults gt s.Name  foo.Id bool inService  serviceId.HasValue codepre  pThat is, a codepersoncode has multiple services assigned to them, and were returning the first service whose codeNamecode is codefoocode.  Then, we get the Id property a Guid on that codeServicecode instance, and cast it to a nullable Guid.  Finally, if that nullable Guid has a value, then the person must be in that service.p  pNote this is not how I would choose to write the above, its just what Im working withp  pI have a feeling that this code simply throws exceptions when the person does not belong to a service with the name foo or really, any service at all, because the codeFirstOrDefaultcode invocation will return a codenullcode codeServicecode instance, and accessing the codeIdcode property will just throw an NPE.p  pI asked the original developer about this snippet, and I was told that doing the followingp  precodeT entity.ltnonexistent entitygt.SomeProperty codepre  pWill simply return a null object, instead of throwing an NPE.  Also, this type of safe null handling occurs with Entity Framework queries.p  pThis seems incredibly counterintuitive, and doesnt even feel like it should be possible.  I tried researching this, but I havent found anything along those lines.  Does anyone have any experience with this  Im 100 happy to find out that Im wrong and to learn something new, but it does not feel correct to me.p  pemAs an addendum, I did try running the query above in Linqpad by using the EntityFramework connection, and I did indeed generate an NPE when trying to access the null objects propertyem p

Negative 1680 pI have a Logitech C920 webcam that provides properly formatted h264 video, and a mic hooked up to an ASUS Xonar external USB sound card.

The audio flow consistently starts with 250ms of garbage noise, and the resulting mp4 video is 250ms 7 or 8 frames at 30fps out of sync.p  pSeems like the sources start simultaneously, but the sound card inserts 250ms of initialization junk every time. Or perhaps, the camera takes 250ms longer to start up but reports an incorrect start of stream flag. Or, maybe the clocks in my devices are out of sync for some reason. I dont know how to figure out the difference between these and other potential root causes.p  pWhatever the cause, Id like to patch over the symptoms at least. Ive been trying to do any of the following in the gstreamer pipeline, any of which would satisfy my requirementsp  ul liCut out the first 250ms of audioli liDelay the video by 250ms or 7 frames li liSynchronize the audio and video timestamps properly with attributes like alsasrc slavemethod or v4l2src iomodeli ul  pAnd Im apparently doing it wrong. Nothing works. No matter what, I always end up with the video running 250ms7 frames ahead of the audio. Adding the queue elements emreportedlyem fixed the sync issue as mediainfo now reports Duration values for audio and wideo within 20ms of each other, which would be acceptable. But thats not how the resulting videos actually work. Clap my hands, the noise arrives late.p  pThis can be fixed in post processing but why not avoid the hassle and get it right, straight from the gst pipeline Im all out of tricks and just about ready to fall back to fixing every single videos sync by hand instead. Any ideas out therep  pThanks for any help, tips, ideas.p

Negative 1680 pIn one of the background files of my chrome extension Im checking for cookies and ran into a problem. In my function codechrome.cookies.geturl domain, name name,functioncookie code I am able to get the cookie object and pass it into the last parameter an anonymous function as the variable emcookieem and access its value with emcookie.valueem.p  pThe problem is that I am only able to send a return response from the parent function and not the nested anonymous function from within the codechrome.cookies.getcode call.p  pIn my example below I am able to return a response verified with an alert on another page with strongvalue1strong but strongvalue2strong is never being returned... After doing a lot of reading I think I narrowed down the problem to a scoping error... By that I mean my response call strongsendResponsestrong a parameter in the parent function is not being accessed by the nested anonymous function.p  precodefunction getCookiesrequest, sender, sendResponse, domain, name      chrome.cookies.geturl domain, name name, functioncookie              sendResponsemyvarvalue2 DOES NOT WORK             ifcookie                 anotherFunctioncookie.value             else                 anotherFunction0                       sendResponsemyvarvalue1   WORKS  codepre  pSo basically, I just need to figure out some method to push my strongsendResponsestrong parameter down to the anonymous function or recreate a similar method that would not cause this scoping issue.

Negative 1680 pIm currently rewriting a website that need a lot of different sizes for each images. In the past I was doing it by creating the thumbnails images for all sizes on the upload. But now I have a doubt about is performance. This is because now I have to change my design and half of my images are not of the right size. So I think of 2 solutions p  ol lipKeep doing this and add a button on the backend to regenerate all the images. The problem is that I always need to know every sizes needed by every part of the site.pli lipOnly upload the real size image, and when displaying it, put in the SRC tag something like srthumbs.phpimgmyimagepathimage.jpgampwidth120ampheight120. Then create the thumb and display it. Also my script would check if the thumb already exists, if it does it doesnt need to recrate it so just display it. Each 5 Days launch a script with a crontask to delete all the thumbs to be sure to only use the usefull ones.pli ol  pI think that the second solution is better but Im a little concern by the fact that I need to call php everytime an image is shown, even if its already created, its php that give it to display...p  pThanks for your advisesp

Negative 1680 pLong story short, I have a reporting system that allows users to enter a custom logic. p  pFor example their logic might be code1 AND 2 OR 3 AND 4code. p  pEach of the numbers in the logic represent a filter criteria. If the filter criteria matches, it replaces the number with codetruecode, if not it replaces the number with codefalsecode.p  pI wanted to find a way to validate if the logic above matches the criteria. So I created the following code and used MySQL to check itp  precode The filter criteria...  filters  array     1 gt true,     2 gt false,     3 gt true,     4 gt true    The users custom logic logic  1 AND 2 OR 3 AND 4   Put brackets around each number so that 10 doesnt conflict with 1 logic  pregreplace[09], [1], logic   logic now looks like [1] AND [2] OR [3] AND [4]   Go through each filter and replace the relevant number foreachfilters AS filterid gt filterbool      logic  strreplace[ . filterid . ], filterbool, logic    logic now looks like true AND false OR true AND true   Check the query logic using MySQL match  mysqlgtgetrowSELECT  . logic .  AS result   Result if matchgtresult  1     echo Filters match else     echo Failed codepre  pMy question is, is there a way for my to validate the logic without using MySQL If I have 10,000 records to validate, it has to make 10,000 MySQL calls to check each one.p  pHopefully I am making sense  Thanks in advancep

Negative 1680 pI am trying to set up a solution to allow full debugging of javascript code directly on an Android tablet.  This is an HTML5 app running in a standard mobile browser such as Chrome or Firefox that needs debugging. By full I mean that the ability to set breakpoints and step through the code in,over,out is required.p  pBeing able to debug directly on the device is important for cases in the field where a PC to debug remotely with is not available.  At some point the ability to debug offline capable web apps will be needed, where the proxy server will not have to do anything, assuming the front end code has already been loaded into the browser andor cached on the device before losing the network connection, but that is not the focus of this question.p  pI was able to get a Weinre solution working, but discovered that Weinre does not have the capability of setting breakpoints or stepping through code.  Then I discovered the a hrefhttpswww.jshybugger.com relnofollowjsHybuggera app, a forpay product which I can run on the tablet, which proxies request to the server and then serves up a debugging interface which I can actually view using a different browser tab on the same android tablet device.p  pThe piece that I am missing is that jsHybugger does not support https, and therefore will not talk to the server that is serving up the code to be debugged.   It is important to use https and not http because sensitive information is being passed between the server and the browser.  Since the debugging is occurring in the field it is not like it is on a LAN where lack of https is not so critical.  It is always possible to do some debugging in a more controlled setting, but inevitably errors will occur in the field which require emergency debugging using real not dummy or sanitized for http data.p  pI know that there are reverse proxies that are out there  for instance I can reverse proxy https to http in apache very easily.  But the problem is, since the connection between the tablet and the server needs to be encrypted, I cant do the proxying on the server, and since another nonAndroid device is not always available, I need to do it on the tablet.  And so far, I have not found any apps out there that obviously look like they will do what I need.   For instance, I have look at iJetty, since I have read that Jetty upon which it is based can do what I am looking for, but all the examples I see on proxying are Java code, and I would like to avoid needing to write any code myself for this.  I have also looked at Fiddler, but it doesnt appear to run on Android, despite the bold claim that it is The free web debugging proxy for any browser, system or platform.  Obviously the claim that Fiddler is here to help, no matter what platform or language you use to develop is false in this case.  I have also looked at various apps in the Google Play store, without finding anything.  Perhaps this feature just isnt advertised prominently, and I have missed it.   Hopefully there is some app out there already that does what I need with a minimum of config fiddling.  Ideally it doesnt require root if it does it isnt a showstopper, but its less preferred as rooting just to be able to debug can be a hassle as nothing else we do requires it, and some devices are more fiddly to root than others.p  pAlternately, if there is a better way to accomplish what I am trying to do, I will accept that as an answer instead.p

Negative 1680 pI find using the regular Forms api easier than ModelForm but i dont find any methods for saving the data to the database i have read the Working with Forms, the Forms API, searched google etc. How are you suppose to save the form data to the database, do you have to instantiate a model you have, then populate the fields with the form data and then use the model objects save method  If thats the case then maybe ModelForm would be a lot easier in the long run because saving to the database would be a lot less coding...p  pI dont always want to save data to all the fields in the database, only some and that seems to create a problem when using ModelForm, or is this where the exclude keyword comes in  The ModelForm API seems a little too complicated then it should be just to save data from a form which is why ive used the regular Forms API where i can create what i need easy but saving the data seems to be a hassle, what are you pointers on this, can i use the regular Forms API or do you strongly recommned me to take another read through ModelForm and use that  I think it would be easier to use the regular Forms and i dont mind a litte more coding but if its a lot more than i might check out the ModelForm after allp

So Im trying to define an association in my user.rb something likep  precode    hasmany followinguserposts, through gt following codepre  pObviously this isnt quite right, but where am I going wrongp

Negative 1680 pI have created a set of custom navigation elements for a video, to simulate walking around a building for fire training. When an overlay is pressed, the routine jumps to a predetermined spot using vidElmt.currentTime  5 for example. This works fine on Windows Chrome, FF, and IE 11 and on the iPad Safari, but when I try it on my Android phone 4.3, using Chrome or the builtin browser, the videos jump to the wrong spots. For example, if I set it to jump to the 5 second spot, it looks like it jumps to 2, 3 or 4 second spot.p  pI know some people may point out that I could be trying to jump to a spot not yet loaded, but I know the parts of the video Im jumping to are definitely already loaded.p  pI wonder if its something about my video format mp4.

Negative 1680 pI have sets of large numbers of files 5000 per directory which are significantly slowing down my file system access. I have plenty of space, and the data is important. Id like to combine them into a single file per directory. Creating an archive would be the simple solution, but I dont want to reduce the recoverability. Some sort of flat image e.g., an uncompressed tarfile would work fine, but I would think theres a format that could actually be more recoverable e.g., by storing parity information in the same amount of space. Im working in an mixed unixlinuxmac environment.p  pIs there an imagecompression format that minimizes compression while providing paritytype information, or would a raw image be the maximally recoverable file formatp

Negative 1680 pCan the F compiler separate out code paths by currying a function in which different types imply different paths through subsequent called functionsp  pConsider the following discriminated union.

Negative 1680 pI am just starting to learn android application development. I was looking through the checkbox and probing on various possibilities of dynamically creating it and much more.  Now, I have a small doubt out of curiosity.  QUESTION   Say I have 10 items in a string array with each one having their own names. Now , all I needed to know is.. I can implement checkbox manually for these 10 items. But my question is , Say I have 100 items listed with each one having unique name.I want to create checkbox dynamically on reading the number of items in my string array and also to set the text of each checkbox to the correspondingly read item in my string array. p  pExample say I have 4 names. Apple, Google, Microsoft, Linux.  Now in my activity i wanted to set 4 checkbox dynamically and set the text of each checkbox to these four values. A generalized solution i.e. to expand your code for any number of items for this question will be appreciated .p  pAny help on this is highly appreciated. Thanks to those genius developers out there and I am so happy to be a part of this forum as well. This forum has taught me so many things with those incredible developers out there.p

Negative 1680 pI am using a hrefhttpsws.apache.orgwss4jdownload.html relnofollowWSS4Ja to create a soap request signer with a certificate from the keystore. My keystore format is .pkcs and everything works with the first signing, but if I try to run the program to sign more than one document and it doesnt find the certificate in the keystore. It seems to me that the certificate is possibly consumed during signing, which means that it no longer exists for the current environment. If the program stops and starts again it will sign the first request but the second request fails. I have stepped through multiple times and cannot figure out what the cause is. This code is the last thing being called before the certificate disappears from the keystore codethis.certUri  getWsConfig.getIdAllocator.createSecureIdX509, certs[0]code this is found on line 556 in codeWSSecSignature.classcode.

Negative 1680 pWell, this question may be done due to my poor understanding of the job of the delegates. p  pUsing the modelview framework. I have made several derived delegates till now, but what I need right now is to get a selectoptiondelegate for example a combobox to show as options the data saved on a column of my QTableModel I select. Im not being able to do this, since I think while reimplementing, the arguments of the functions, doesnt contain the whole model but only the item of the QTableModel.p  pI dont know how to fill the delegates editor with the data of the model column. I think this cant be done due to safety issues on programming, I have tried to send a signal from the delegate asking for the model, but it appears that delegates cannot emit signals.p  pCan anyone guide me on how to do thisp  pI have looked at a combobox delegate with custom options example that is around but that one does not read the options from a model, the options are loaded as constants.p
Negative 1680 pIm really stumped on this one. We had a table with a two part primary key. The parts were a reviewid a foreign key from another table and a timestamp. Whoever designed this table didnt realize that some situations could result in two entries having identical timestamps, and I was getting ORA00001 unique constraint errors. p  pHowever, as this table was a log, it had no real need to have a primary key in the first place, so I removed the primary key constraint. Despite this constraint no longer existing, Im still getting the same error.p  pIve tried adding elements to the PK to prevent the conflict as well as restoring the constraint but disabling it. Oracle SQL Developer insists that the database reflects the changes Ive made, but the behavior suggests that its still using the original PK.

Negative 1680 pI am building a web application Django and googles NDB and have to structure my models now. I have read many examples about how to implement OneToMany but  to be honest  Im even more confused right now after having read these.p  pLet me describe my problem with a similar example I have users and each user can read multiple books. A user can stop reading at any time and the progress is saved. Even if a book has been finished, the progress will be saved and never deleted.p  pI need to check the progress of all books a user has started to read all the time, so this has to be efficient and should require as few db reads as possible. The amount of books is not too much lt 1000 and also the books are thin say, only one chapter, title, author thats it. Its the mass of progress and the permanent lookup of the progress that Im fearing since every user has his own progress to probably every book.p  pHow can I structure my models best to these requirements If I use the StructuredProperty in my User model will the size of the books that are refered to in Progress count towards the limit of X MB hope not If not I guess something like this is the best way to go I can read progress fast, without additional lookup, and if neccessary get the book from the db.p  precodeclass Bookndb.model     name  ndb.StringPropertyrequiredTrue     ...  class Progressndb.model     book  ndb.KeyPropertykindBook, requiredTrue     lastpageread  ndb.IntegerPropertyrequiredTrue, default0     ...  class Userndb.model     name  ndb.StringPropertyrequiredTrue     booksandprogress  ndb.StructuredPropertyProgress, repeatedTrue     ... codepre

Why is that In order to delete a node, we only gotta do 3 things...First, unlink the pointer of the node we want to delete.

Negative 1680 pModern PHP frameworks like Zend, Symfony, Phalcon all use a DI container and you simply pass it around to access all the framework functionalities. Im wondering if I shouldcould use the DI container in my business code. Lets say I need to use a database access object and a mailer object and they are already in the DI because the framework use them. Could I simply pass the DI container when instantiating a business class p  pFor example, I have a class that deals with users in the database, you could call it my user model class. Right now I simply pass the DI container to the constructor of the model class when instantiating it in a controller and its fine and easy. Just toss everything in the DI container and done. p  pBut Im about to develop an API that will also use this user model class. Since it expects a DI container, I would need to know before hand what the dependencies of the model are and initialize a DI container with the right ones. Before, I would just pass each dependency as a parameter in the constructor but with IoC I need to know, without looking at the parameters, what are the dependencies of the class and what is the name used to access each dependency. For instance, I would need to know that there should be a PDO object identified by db in the DI container. Is this a good approach for businesslibrary codep  pIm probably mixing up terms here but I hope you get the idea.p  pThanksp

However, this doesnt solve the problem, because it comes back when I use the story board again later, and sometimes it comes back when I simply try to open Xcode.p  pI have also tried restarting my computer and clearing out the derived data, neither of which have solved the problem. I also turned indexing off so that Xcode wouldnt index all my files and run really slowly. This didnt help though.p  pIve seen other people with this same problem using older versions of Xcode, but none of them have provided a solution that worked for me.p  pPlease help. Thanks.p

Negative 1680 pCan entities in the C standard library legally be forward declared in Cp  pI just asked this same question but for C and so far the answer seems to be yes.p  pa hrefhttpstackoverflow.comq277202581128289Forward declare entities in C standard libraryap  pI know that entities in the C standard library cannot be forward declared for the reasons given in the linked question above. Before thinking of this question I would have said that the C standard library is part of the C standard library and therefore entities in the C standard library cannot be forward declared in C.p  pNow Im not sure. It would be surprising if the C standard mandates something about the C standard library that the C standard does not.p  pMy understanding is that in practice, implementations of C tend to come with an implementation of C and the same header files and libraries are used for each but optionally rebranded as  for C. So in practice, forward declarations of entities in the C standard library will likely compile just fine in C. Still, Im curious about what the C standard mandates.p

Negative 1680 pI am in the process of building a calculator to determine how long a childs colic is going to last.p  pI have the calculator working correctly just need it to take the value it gets and run it through the array and match the next closest value to the value shown and then reference it to its associated week.p  pSo for instance if you select week 2 and then week 5 the calculation returns childs colic will end in .5614399999999999 weeks. You would then run the .5614 through the wesseldata array and find that .5614 falls in between week 6 and 7. I would then take the next closest week which is week 7 and show that instead of the .5614. So it should say childs colic will end in .64 weeks. Now that it has found the .64 I want it to output the associated weeks so that it would say childs colic will end in 7 weeks.p  pThis is what I have written to find the next associated value but cant get it to work.p  precodefunction closest num, wesseldata                  var curr  wesseldata[0]                 var diff  Math.abs num  curr                 for var val  0 val lt wesseldata.length val                      var newdiff  Math.abs num  wesseldata[val]                     if newdiff lt diff                          diff  newdiff                         curr  wesseldata[val  1]                                                  return curr       codepre  pI also have a fiddle so you can see what I am talking about.p  pa hrefhttpjsfiddle.netjessemfultonrguoz7bp6 relnofollowFiddleap
Negative 1680 pIm a beginner HTML learner and I was selftaught on the way through. This is the first website I have ever done by scratch using HTML and CSS and JS.

Negative 1680 pAndroid Device Monitor fails to start with an error message that says to read the log file. However, the log file has a lot of information that is impossible to interpret without a better understanding of the program. Several people seem to have posted a similar question, but I cant find any useful answer.p  pOn Windows 7 64 bit, I have Android Studio 1.0.2 and Eclipse Luna installed, both in 64 bit versions. Each have their own Android SDK installed. Everything in both environments seems to be working normally. I have Jre7 64 and jdk7 64 installed, and also jre7 32 for a separate program that requires the 32 bit java. JAVAHOME is set to CProgram FilesJavajre7 and the first path in the PATH variable is CProgram FilesJavajre7bin.p  pI am unable to start the device monitor from the tools directory of either SDK installation using the monitor.bat file. I am also unable to start the device monitor from its 64 bit subdirectory using the monitor.exe file directly, which is what the batch file calls anyway.p  pThis one has me completely stumped. Everything seems to be installed and working correctly. I am reluctant to spend hours trying various possible solutions, such as removing and reinstalling java, removing and installing the Android SDK, etc. when I have low confidence in those solving the issue. Ive already spent a good bit of time trying to find an answer. If anyone can shed some light on this, it would be great.p  pRegards, Michaelp

Negative 1680 pFor marshalling purpose and automatic type building with native API, I need to validate field names for some structure during runtime.

Negative 1680 pGiven a list codeAcode of bool elements and another list codeBcode with the same length, the goal is to do something essentiallyp  precodeB  [B[i] for i in xrangelenA if A[i]] codepre  pHowever, sometimes codeBcode is not a basic python list for example, it might be created with codemanager.listcode, where codemanagercode is an instance of codeManagercode from the codemultiprocessingcode module.  The above list comprehension will turn it into a plain list, which will lose the desired function to share data between subprocesses.p  pWhat I come up with is something likep  precodedef myfilterA, B     c  0     for i in xrangelenA         if not A[i]             B.popic             c  c  1 codepre  pSo that codemyfilterA, Bcode will turn codeBcode into its sublist where the elements of codeAcode are codeTruecode.p  pHowever, this is a bit ugly.

Negative 1680 pIve been tasked with optimizing a mature 2D Unity project.  The biggest performance hiccup occurs when the app plays particle animations, so Im trying to prerender the graphics containing these animations into a spritesheet using a RenderTexture at runtime the storage restrictions prevent me from doing this as a preprocessing step.  Ive added a camera to the project and in the constructor for the GameObjects in question, I supply the camera with a RenderTexture, position it a fixed distance from the object, and then call the objects animator.Update1.0f30 while moving the camera viewport across the RenderTexture, thereby rendering the frames.  It works, mostly.  The problem is the particle systems dont render, and the animation doesnt seem to advance properly, though it does advance.  Would anyone know why the particle systems are not rendering, and why the animation is not advancing properly  Ive copied my code below.  Thank you.p  precode        if this.animatedGameObject  null              GameObject nobj  GameObjectRoutineRunner.Instantiate this.animatedGameObject, new Vector3100, 100, 10, new Quaternion             Animator animator  nobj.GetComponentltAnimatorgt             if animator  null                  RenderTexture active  RenderTexture.active                 RenderTexture rt  RenderTexture.GetTemporary 2048, 2048, 16                 Camera c  GameObject.Find ParticleCamera.camera                 int x, y                 float frameStep                  rt.DiscardContents                 c.enabled  true                 c.targetTexture  rt                 if nobj.renderer  null                      Bounds b  nobj.renderer.bounds                     c.transform.Translatenobj.transform.position  new Vector3b.size.x0.5f, b.size.y0.5f, 10.0f, Space.World                  else                      Debug.Lognobj.renderer is null.n                                  if animator.animation  null ampamp animator.animation.clip  null                      Debug.Log Animation clip found, using length of   animator.animation.clip.length   seconds.n                     frameStep  animator.animation.clip.length64.0f                  else                       I always seem to hit this else case, so render the                      animation at 30fps.

Negative 1680 pTake, for example, the following naive implementation of a right fold in Schemep  precodedefine foldrite kons knil clist   if null clist     knil     kons car clist foldrite kons knil cdr clist codepre  pThis is obviously not a candidate for tail call elimination since the recursive invocation of codefoldritecode has to complete before calling codekonscode. Now, I might be a little clever and use continuationpassing style insteadp  precodedefine foldritecps kons knil clist kontinuation   if null clist     kontinuation knil     foldritecps kons knil cdr clist        lambda x kontinuation kons car clist x codepre  pNow codefoldritecpscode is tail recursive, but the intermediate continuations built up during recursion will still have to be kept somewhere. So while I might not blow out the stack, Im still using about as much memory as with the first version, and somehow I get the feeling that first collecting a massive pile of continuations and then unravelling them all in one fell swoop should be bad for performance, although the second version was actually measurably faster on my machine.p  pBut if a left fold can run in constant space minus the value being accumulated and a right fold on a list is the same as a left fold on its reverse, then I imagine there should be a way to implement a tailrecursive right fold that can also run in constant space. If so, how would I do that Getting even more general, what ways are there to make a nontail recursive function into a tailrecursive one, preferably one that can run in constant space assuming that an explicit loop can be written in an imperative language that also runs in constant space Have I made any wrong assumptionsp  pAlthough Ive tagged Scheme and Lisp, Im interested in solutions in any language the approaches should apply to functional programs in general.p

Negative 1680 pHow do I make the styling of codeltbuttongtcode elements resemble codeltagtcode elements as closely as possiblep  pI dont need linkspecific codetextdecoration underline color bluecode and such  Im resetting those anyway. Basically, I want the codeltbuttongtcode to be like plain text until I apply classes.p  pBackground In a JavaScript app, I have click handlers bound to codeltagtcode elements. Those codeltagtcode elements dont have a natural codehrefcode, which messes up keyboard accessibility in some browsers. It seems that replacing codeltagtcode with codeltbuttongtcode would reflect the intent of the element better. But when I use codeltbuttongtcode, the browser messes up the styling badly.

Negative 1680 pI am using PyCharm to debug a moderately complex Pyramid web application with a lot of dependencies. When I run the application inside PyCharm using PyCharms emDebugem run, the application start up slows down significantly. This kills the normal web application workflow of edit, save, refresh.

Negative 1680 pI have a RADGrid using AJAX where I create a custom ButtonColumn. This column holds buttons obviously which need to use FullPostBacks rather than PartialPostBacks. The grid also allows for paging. In the grids ItemCreated event I add the visible buttons ie the first 10 items if paging is set to 10 items per page to the ScriptManagers RegisterPostBackControl method. This works perfectly fine.p  pThe problem I have is that when a user jumps to another page, they are causing a PartialPostBack which redraws the grid with the next set of records to be viewed, which also runs the code to RegisterPostBackControls. However, these buttons do not perform FullPostBacks...they stay as PartialPostBack controls. It seems that the ScriptManager.RegisterPostBackControl method does not function when called from a PartialPostBack.p  pAnyone know how I can add the buttons within the grid to the list of FullPostBack controls when a user moves to another page of records within the gridp  pBenp
Negative 1680 pI have a Bootstrap listgroup with several items in it, and a filter text box.  When more than one item is added or removed from the group at the same time, the items get reordered.p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comuC5AI.gif altfiltering reorders items before animationp  pIn the removal case, all the remaining items are shifted to the top, and the removed items are shifted down for their animation. For example, suppose a list of three items x, y, and z.  The filter suddenly filters out x and z, leaving y in place.  Item y gets placed into xs box, x into ys box, and then the second two boxes do their animation.p  pIn the addition case, the items are placed in sorted order, the existing boxes are filled by the first n items of the sorted list, and then the remaining items get animated boxes below it.  In our x, y, z list example, suppose x and z are already filtered out, and the only displayed item is y.  When the filter is removed, x takes ys box, two boxes are created below and filled with y and z.p  pHeres a snippet of my codep  precoderender      let tables  this.state.tables     let items  []      for let i in tables          let table  tables[i],             tableName  table.name,             tableId  encodeURIComponenttableName.replacesg, ,             isTableSelected  this.state.selectedTable ampamp table.name  this.state.selectedTable.name,             show  tableMatchesFiltertable          if show              items.push                 ltdivgt  wrap in div so we dont have to deal with animating padding                      ltListGroupItem                          classNameclassNameslistgroupitem, active isTableSelected                          onClickthis.handleTableSelect.bindthis, tableId                         itemKeytableId keytableId stylewhiteSpace pre                         headertableNamegt                         table.description                     ltListGroupItemgt                 ltdivgt                                 return   ...           ltdiv reftableListGroup classNamelistgroup colxs12gt             ltReactCSSTransitionGroup transitionNametableListGroupgt                 items             ltReactCSSTransitionGroupgt         ltdivgt          ...        codepre  pIm trying to figure out how to get the items to stay in their boxes and have the correct boxes appeardisappear.p
Negative 1680 pIm currently building an application that will have addresses inside it and Im using pregmatch to do some character detection and throw an error the users way if they use invalid characters to make sure its secure.p  pMy problem is using pregmatch it seems to be behaving strangely and I dont think Im using it correctly or not because of how its acting.p  pMy code below should allow letters A to Z, both upper and lowercase for the City, County and Country. The code below is an example of the city when that field is updated p  precode The user wants to update the city so lets go through the update process if  issetPOST[city]         Check that the city is different before we try to update it     if  newcompanycity  companycity             Check that the city is less than 50 characters and contains valid characters         if  strlennewcompanycity lt 50 ampamp pregmatch[AZaz], newcompanycity                 The city is fine so lets update it             updatesuccess  true             mysqliquerysql, UPDATE clients SET city  newcompanycity WHERE companyid  companyid or diemysqlierrorsql           else                The city doesnt meet the requirements to be update so return an error             updatefail  true             cityerror  true                   codepre  pNow the issue is that codecityerrorcode is being triggered when the current value is Sheffield and you change it to York it returns an error as the codecityerrorcode variable becomes true. However changing the value from Sheffield to Sheffield 1, it then works and updates the database.p  pAm I missing something here I thought that AZaz only checks for letters and if there are only letters then it should work. But this doesnt seem to be working at all.p  hr  pJust a quick update before I posted this. I just realised I need to add a space at the end of string and then it works. Im really confused with this. So without a space it returns an error as pregmatch doesnt allow it but with a space even though its not defined inside pregmatch it allows it. Surely this isnt normal behaviorp

Negative 1680 pDoes anyone know how lead qualifying works internallyp  pPlease, consider following scenario I created new lead record, so I am an owner and it was created by me of course.br I have a worflow registered on onCreate of lead, this workflow is owned by another user and it sets one field on newly created record.  So my new lead record has these lookups  Owner  me, CreatedBy  me, ModifiedBy  another user.  If I want now to Qualify a lead, I check the Account and Opprtunity checkboxes in Qualify lead dialog and hit OK, then I have got missing privillege record create Opportunity.  My user has User privillege on Create of Opportunity. CRM wants to use ModifiedBy user as owner and creator for new Opportunity record, it is the only explanation.p  pSo my another question is whether someone knows whether this is an OOB behavior of CRM or there is plugin or something in my organization I am working on. I did not find such a plugin or workflow or script.p  pThanks for all your answers.p

Negative 1680 pI have made a GCM chat application. The problem I am facing is that I am not able to fetch message content and sender name from the notifications that are received by the receiver.

Negative 1680 pI want to use pool to store objects which make expensive parsing from other objects in memory. codeMyObjectcode is created on the basis of codeStringcode key provided to identify the object in the pool.p  pI came across a solution to use codeorg.apache.commons.pool2.impl.GenericKeyedObjectPoolcode to implement this functionality. I created a factory which extends codeBaseKeyedPooledObjectFactorycode and overrides the codecreateString keycode and codewrapMyObject valuecode methods. In codewrapcode I write only codereturn new DefaultPooledObjectltMyObjectgtvaluecode. The main object creation logic goes into codecreatecode.p  pAfter the object is created in the factory, its a readonly kind of object i.e., it wont be changed after getting out from the factory, only data is fetched from it but kept unaltered. Now the problem is, once I codeborrowObjectcode, the same object isnt accessible until codereturnObjectcode is called on the same key with the same object reference. This step is irrelevant in my application. So can I make changes in the factorypoolcodeDefaultPooledObjectcode to avoid calling codereturnObjectcode everytime after the object is borrowed. Once the object is borrowed, it must not be required to be returned and the next call to codeborrowObjectcode must return the same object instead of creating a new one as happens when it is called if object wasnt returned.p  pAlso, my application is singlethreaded, so I dont need to waste time on synchronization. Is there any other class available in the API to do sop
Negative 1680 pIve created a codeGUIcode using codePyQt5code wich takes codeshapefilescode and one code.dwgcode file as inputs. In the code.dwgcode file, I have a certain amount of standard codelayerscode that should be inside.

But Ive looked and codePyAcadcode or codePythonCADcode dont seem to be very implemented yet. If anyone has used Python for AutoCAD, I am looking for some advicetips. And if you have an alternative idea for my problem that would be greatly appreciated p

Negative 1680 pI recently switched my openldap backend from HDB to backsql and PostgreSQL. I slightly modified the backsql rdbmspostgres database schema files provided in OpenLDAP to create my database and mappings. Im basically only using persons and organizational units to create my tree structure. However, I have noticed that searches performed from PHPLDAPAdmin and other tools are very slow. When clicking on an ou object that has 535 persons under it, simply displaying the ou attributes will take seconds as opposed to milliseconds with HDB. When viewing all children for the OU and retrieve the 535 objects, it takes 0.08 seconds with HDB, as opposed to 6.19 seconds with Postgres and the backsql. Is there a way to improve  this performance limitation with Postgres Are there configurations to enable in openldap The Postgres database itselfp  pThank you,p

Negative 1680 pI have encountered a problem with a portion of my database.I am the sole user, coder, and webmaster for my site.p  pThe following problem is associated with a PHP program of mine.p  pProblem Descriptionp  pThis problem only occurs on my iPhone.When I go to the designated page on my site, I normally expect to see a list of 45 rpm records for sale,listed in alphabetical sequence by record label. For many of the items listed, there is an image of the item for sale. These images are all JPG files and each has a unique name that is called for by the image source html for each particular item that is for sale and has an associated image many items have no image, that is normal. The problem is that when I look at this page on my iPhone iOS 8.4, it is sometimes pulling in the wrong image for some items. For example, it might show the image for a record on the Excello record label but tie it to a Geffen record. But when my wife views the same page  on her iPhone, it seems to display properly  I think she has an earlier version of iOS.p  pHas anyone else ever seen a similar problem to this, and associated with iPhone The images show properly on my macbook,. The program used is a PHP program, as I mentioned above. Many of the other pages on my site also use PHP programs of similar design, but they are not showing any image problems as far as Ive noticed.p  pI have had this program in place for several years, and this problem never occurred before.Ive added more items for sale recently to that page and Im wondering if there is a max allowable record count that i have exceeded that could cause a glitch.p  pBut I dont understand why the wrong image would ever be tagged to a record when the name of thatimage is not called for in the detail record.p  pAny help and  or commentary would be much appreciatedp  pThank youp

Negative 1680 pAs you know a FrameworkElement has a property of type codeResourceDictionarycode named codeResourcescode, in XAML we can declare it easily like thisp  precode ltFrameworkElement.Resourcesgt      ltSomeObject xKeysomeKeygt      ltSomeOtherObject xKeysomeOtherKeygt  ltFrameworkElement.Resourcesgt codepre  pIts some kind of implicit syntax, all the elements declared inside will be added to the codeResourceDictionarycode.

It serves as a fallback solution when  every other rewriteredirect fails e.g. in an aliased environment without  modrewrite. Additionally, this reduces the matching process for the  start page path  because otherwise Apache will apply the rewriting rules  to each configured DirectoryIndex file e.g. index.php, index.html, index.pl. DirectoryIndex app.php  ltIfModule modrewrite.cgt     RewriteEngine On       Determine the RewriteBase automatically and set it as environment variable.      If you are using Apache aliases to do mass virtual hosting or installed the      project in a subdirectory, the base path will be prepended to allow proper      resolution of the app.php file and to redirect to the correct URI. It will      work in environments without path prefix as well, providing a safe, onesize      fits all solution. But as you do not need it in this case, you can comment      the following 2 lines to eliminate the overhead.     RewriteCond REQUESTURI1 ..2     RewriteRule .

So in case you get a too many redirects error or you always get redirected      to the start page because your Apache does not expose the REDIRECTSTATUS      environment variable, you have 2 choices       disable this feature by commenting the following 2 lines or       use Apache gt 2.3.9 and replace all L flags by END flags and remove the        following RewriteCond best solution     RewriteCond ENVREDIRECTSTATUS      RewriteRule app.php.

Negative 1680 pIm trying to copy a OneNote page to another Notebook with a new title. That works so far with GetPageContent and UpdatePageContent. It copys all items except Images. The Image Object is created, but it only shows a red x. I tried to fix that problem on my own, wrote the XML of the old page and the one of the new page in files. The only difference between the Image Objects was that the format attribute was missing in the new page. Then I wrote the content of my XML string in a file before UpdatePageContent, loaded the content from my new Page and wrote it in another file. So I had my string which I used to UpdatePageContent and the XML String wich actually was shown in OneNote. Before UpdatePageContent the format attribute existed and after it was missing. I even tried manually adding the attribute in the file and then loading it and updating it, but that didnt change something, it was also removed after UpdatePageContent.p  pIs that missing attribute causing the red x or is there something else to check And if it is the problem, how can I avoid that the format attribute is removedp  pEvery help is appreciated.p  pHere is my code to copy the page and update the page ID is the ID of the page I want to copyp  precode      onApp.CreateNewPageID, out A, NewPageStyle.npsBlankPageWithTitle         var XMLPageContent  XDocument.ParsePageContent         onApp.GetPageContentA, out xml         var NewXD  XDocument.Parsexml         NewXD.ElementNS  Page.AttributepageLevel.Value  XMLPageContent.ElementNS Page.AttributepageLevel.Value         NewXD.ElementsNS  Page.Elements.Remove         getChildXMLPageContent.ElementNS  Page, NewXD.ElementNS  Page         var Title  NewXD.DescendantsNS  T.First         Title.Value  NewPage         onApp.UpdatePageContentNewXD.ToString         onApp.GetPageContentA, out xml         doc  XDocument.Parsexml         StreamWriter SW  new StreamWriterCxml.txt         SW.Writedoc.ToString         StreamWriter SW2  new StreamWriterCxml2.txt         SW2.WriteXMLPageContent.ToString         SW.Close         SW2.Close              private void getChildXElement PXE, XElement NXE                   if PXE.Elements  null                              foreach XObject XE in PXE.Nodes                                     try                                         XElement XEE  XElement XE                         XElement toAdd  new XElementXEE.Name.ToString                         foreach XAttribute XA in XEE.Attributes                                                      if XA.Name.LocalName.ContainsobjectID                                                              try                                                                      toAdd.AddXA                                                                  catch Exception e                                                                      MessageBox.ShowXA.Name.ToString                                     throw e                                                                                                                 if toAdd.AttributescallbackID.ToArray.Length gt 0                                                      string[] hilf  toAdd.AttributecallbackID.Value.Split,                              string xml                             onApp.GetPageContentA, out xml                             var doc  XDocument.Parsexml                             hilf[1]  doc.ElementNSPage.AttributeID.Value.Split, [1]                             toAdd.AttributecallbackID.Value    hilf[1]      hilf[3]      hilf[5]                                                     getChildXEE, toAdd                         NXE.AddtoAdd                                    catchInvalidCastException                                      NXE.AddXE                                                             else return          codepre

Negative 1680 pI have a REXX program, running in Windows 10, that makes thousands of copies of the same file, all on C, for a total of tens of gigabytes. The strange thing is that the time per copy varies unpredictably, by as much as a factor of 10, over the course of the process. Monitoring the process I can see that initially it runs very quickly until the cache is full, and then it slows down dramatically, which I guess I can understand. But even after that it can slow even more and then speed up again.p  pI dont start any other processes while this one is running. Anything automatic, such as an online check for updates to some app, would only run for a few seconds, but the slow periods can last 2030 minutes. I never see any competing processes in Task Manager.p  pCan anyone explain this or suggest a way to improve the performance Thanks.p
