Positive 82352 pFollowing your recommendation to ask rather than using the answer field, below is my question. The reason I asked inside a thread was because it was the closest topic I could find, thought it may be in the right environment.p  pPlease permit me newcomer to add my experience with inability to have a New Window or Tab. Here is my site a hrefhttpzahnerbusse.tripod.com relnofollowhttpzahnerbusse.tripod.comap  pBeen on the search for years for answers  found the most promising here. I am using the good old drop down menu because it is forgiving when typos happen. I dont like it when selecting a line that the current page is replaced by the new one. I want the current page to remain for more selection kind of table of contents and the new page in a new TAB  Window. Tab preferred. One menu line enables resetting the menu to its basic coded state, because after selecting the new page the menu sits on the last selected line. The [targetblank] does not work whether added to the submit area or to the actual URL.p  pWhat do I need to change and stay in HTML, please. Just search menu in the webpage code to drive about. Many thanks.p

Positive 82352 pI have a select dropdown list just like thisp  precodeltselect nametype idtypegt ltoptiongtFirst optionltoptiongt codepre  pAnd so on...and I have more than 100 of these options. How can I, through PHP, retrieve the INDEX of the selected value, and not the selected value itself For example is someone selects First Option Id like to get the value 1 or 0, instead of First Option. I know I could just add a value1 but it would take a lot of time to add this for all the elements so Id like to know if there is a quicker, easier method.p  pThanks a lotp

Positive 82352 pI have an online html form that uses a select field to choose a record from an existing record list postcodes specifically which then autopopulates other fields on the form with the rest of the address. This all works fine except that the dropdown list on the form only goes up so far. I need to know if this a limit on the html dropdown or how many records can be passed to the list in the first place Also, ideally, it would be great if there was a way to do it via autocomplete so as you start typing the postcode, it only shows those beginning with said characters  is this possiblep
Positive 82352 pThis might be covered already but Im trying to create dependent drop down lists in MS word. I saw some examples online that help create VB code to do the same.However I had tough time creating one.p  pSo for example if i had to create dependent drop down list like p  p2 drop downs, one for cars, bikes, trucks as the main classification and the next should look likep  pNissan, Ford and chevy as the drop down list when i select cars  Harley,Honda  as the drop down list for bikes Volvo, Freight liner, kenworth   as the drop down list for trucks.p  pSo when i click on the selection trucks from the main classification i should get Volvo, Freight liner and kenworth as options in the word document and same would be the case for others.I would like to know If there are other meanslike softwares or methods to do the same. Thanks for the help in advance. p
Positive 82352 pIm having an issue trying to create an HTML file that runs completely offline except for loading in jQuery for the script.p  pThe page allows the user to first select a state from the state select menu. This triggers an event in which all of the counties of a second select menu are looped through and the ones belonging to the selected state are shown, the others hidden.p  pIn Google Chrome the only browser I am concerned about at the moment the last two states in my list Oklahoma and Tennessee correctly trigger the event and subsequently their inline style is changed to block from  none by jQuery. However, in Chrome I am unable to click on the county list and see the counties displayed. If I change the order in which the counties are ordered in the list, it is always the last two states that do not display their corresponding counties.

Negative 82352 pI have a table in my MYSQL database which does not have a primary key, but has a unique key on two columns.  When using MyEclipses Hibernate reverse engineer tool to create a mapping for that table, it generates two classes, one for named after the table itself, and one with an Id suffix.  It seems most of the useful methods ended up in the Id class, so it seems that is the one you would instantiate and save to persist data.  I can appreciate the fact that the Id class is created in order to represent a unique row in the table  mapped object, but what is the use of splitting out this into two classes, and what, then is the use of the nonIdsuffixed classp  pMy colleague argues you can accomplish the same with just one class and scoffs at using the reverse engineering for these tables which dont have a primary key.  I, on the other hand, assume MyEclipse developers are much smarter than me and that there is a really good reason to do it this way.  Is therep

Negative 82352 pI am working on a new domain model for an application that will have order processing for items built in well, too keep it simple for this question anyway.  I have a class VendorItem that represents items that can be ordered.  Originally the Order class was going to have a list of VendorItems associated with it, but I have come across problems with it so far. p  pLets say that the system has been creating orders for some time just fine.  One day a user comes along and decides that a vendoritem has changed price or some other detail like packaging size.  I wouldnt want the previous orders to be affected by such change.p  pAt first wash I was going to make a OrderLine class that is basically a copy of the VendorItem class, but that just feels smells wrong in the OO sense.p  pIs there a better way to refactor this so I dont have copies of classes and information in the domain modelp

Negative 82352 pIm working on an application for Linux in C which uses multiple threads. The threads which are spawned by the main function do most of the work, and therefore usually finish last. Im seeing some strange behavior, and I believe its due to the main thread terminating before the spawned threads have a chance to finish their jobs. Heres some sample code to illustrate what Im talking aboutp  precodedefine POSIXCSOURCE 200112L define ISOC99SOURCE define EXTENSIONS define GNUSOURCE  include ltpthread.hgt include ltstdio.hgt  void mycleanupvoid arg       printfcleanup sn, char arg    void  threadstuffvoid arg       printfthread startedn      pthreadcleanuppushcleanup, running      if arg           pthreadexitvoid 2      pthreadcleanuppop0      pthreadexitvoid 2    int main       int err      pthreadt tid1, tid2       err  pthreadcreateamptid1, NULL, threadstuff, void 1      err  pthreadcreateamptid2, NULL, threadstuff, void 1       sleep10                  change the value here if you want        return SUCCESS  codepre  pWhen this code is run, the message from the cleanup function is printed twice, as it should be, but other times when it is run, I see the message printed only once sometimes, and other times I see it printed three times or not at all. You add in the sleep function in the main function to play with how long it takes the main function to terminate.p  pWhat can I do to make the program run as it should I suspect it has something to do with joining to the children, but I dont entirely understand the concept of a join or how to apply it to this situation.p  pThanks in advancep

Negative 82352 pI mainly develop C web type applications but recently someone in our engineering group wants to recreate this rather simple C client based app to a C web based app.  Well I found out that all the application does is create a network folder structure a parent directory with some sub directories within it.p  pI then mentioned what are the benefits to making this a web app being that all it does is create some network folder structure.  Well he mentioned that he does not want to create a client application and have say 50 users install this client application.  He wanted it to be in one central place.  So I thought cant you just create one C app and throw it on the network and have multiple people open it and use itp  pIs that possible  I am not a client developer so I would think logically this is possible, but then I thought that if it was a network app then one user opening this application would lock other users out  I personally dont like the idea of webifying this application making it web based as to me it really doesnt make sense to be a web app.p  pThoughts  Ideas p  pstrongMore Info EDITstrongp  pWell I guess I should of included more information. The folders are created via some database data. So it cannot be a batch file or a script.  The end user has to select some entry from a drop down list and that value becomes the value of the parent folder name.p

My employer is considering a switch from CVS to SVN, but Im wondering whether I should push for Mercurial or some other DVCS instead.p  pOne wrinkle with Mercurial is that it seems to be designed around the idea of having a single repository per project.  In this organization, there are dozens of different executables, DLLs, and other components in the current CVS repository, hierarchically organized.  There are a lot of generic reusable components, but also some customerspecific components, and customerspecific configurations.  The current build procedures generally get some set of subtrees out of the CVS repository.p  pIf we move from CVS to Mercurial, what is the best way to organize the repositoryrepositories  Should we have one huge Mercurial repository containing everything  If not, how finegrained should the smaller repositories be  I think people will find it very annoying if they have to pull and push updates from a lot of different places, but they will also find it annoying if they have to pullpush the entire company codebase.p  pAnybody have experience with this, or advicep  hr  pRelated questionsp  ul lia hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions2383826gitbasedsourcecontrolintheenterprisesuggestedtoolsandpracticesGitBased Source Control in the Enterprise Suggested Tools and Practicesali lia hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions2476356distributedversioncontrolforhugeprojectsisitfeasibleDistributed version control for HUGE projects  is it feasibleali ul

Negative 82352 pI have created a small application that, basically, exists in the system tray and the user only needs to open the actual application in VERY few cases.

The only UI that is always accessible is the tray icons contextmenu.p  pSo here is the thing How can I dispose of the WHOLE UI every time the application is minimised I have tried several things in WPF but I can never get rid of the UI objects as WPF keeps references to them.p  pWhat I would love is Open application UI loaded  Minimise to tray  Whole UI disposed and the only memory left is that used by the business logic...

Negative 82352 pI help maintain and build on a fairly large Swing GUI, with a lot of complex interaction.  Often I find myself fixing bugs that are the result of things getting into odd states due to some race condition somewhere else in the code.p  pAs the code base gets large, Ive found its gotten less consistent about specifying via documentation which methods have threading restrictions most commonly, methods that must be run on the Swing EDT.  Similarly, it would be useful to know and provide static awareness into which of our custom listeners are notified on the EDT by specification.p  pSo it came to me that this should be something that could be easily enforced using annotations.  Lo and behold, there exists at least one static analysis tool, a hrefhttpcheckthread.orgCheckThreada, that uses annotations to accomplish this.  It seems to allow you to declare a method to be confined to a specific thread most commonly the EDT, and will flag methods that try to call that method without also declaring themselves as confined to that thread.p  pSo on the surface this just seems like a lowpain, hugegain addition to the source and build cycle.  My questions arep  ul liAre there any success stories for people using CheckThread or similar libraries to enforce threading constraints  Any stories of failure  strongWhy did it succeedfailstrongli listrongIs this good in theorystrong  Are there theoretical downsidesli liIs this good in practice  strongIs it worth itstrong  What kind of value has it deliveredli liIf it works in practice, strongwhat are good tools to support thisstrong  Ive just found CheckThread but admit Im not entirely sure what Im searching for to find other tools that do the same thing.li ul  pI know whether its right for us depends on our scenario.  But Ive never heard of people using something like this in practice, and to be honest it doesnt seem to have taken hold much from some general browsing.  So Im wondering why.p

Negative 82352 pIm not sure Im using the right terms.  Long ago I tinkered with Eclipse and recall there were environment variables that could be specified in project settings and compiler directive fields in the GUI itself to customize builds.

Basically, I want to pass several variables into the Additional compiler arguments, like user name, FlashBuilder version, date time, and anything else from the list of variables that might be accessible and interesting.p

Negative 82352 pI have a MVC2 web app without a database that is being hosted by IIS7. The model is a custom index of some properties of a filesystem, and right now the index is stored in memory. The problem is that on a regular basis, the data stored in memory gets released, and the index must be recreated. Maybe the best solution would be to serialize the index object and load it when the index gets released, but it would be much simpler if I could prevent the data from going anywhere.p

So, I came up with a kludgey method of narrowing the numbers see MyGetHashCode. p  pDoes anyone have any pointerstipscriticism for this implementation of the hash function and in general Thanks in advancep  precodeusing System using System.Collections.Generic using System.Linq using System.Text using Microsoft.VisualStudio.TestTools.UnitTesting namespace HashMap      class Program               public class MyKVPltT, Kgt                      public T Key  get set              public K Value  get set              public MyKVPT key, K value                              Key  key                 Value  value                                 public class MyHashMapltT, Kgt  IEnumerableltMyKVPltT,Kgtgt             where TIComparable                       private const int mapsize  5000             private ListltMyKVPltT,Kgtgt[] storage             public MyHashMap                              storage  new ListltMyKVPltT,Kgtgt[mapsize]                           System.Collections.IEnumerator System.Collections.IEnumerable.GetEnumerator                              return GetEnumerator                          public IEnumeratorltMyKVPltT, Kgtgt GetEnumerator                              foreach ListltMyKVPltT, Kgtgt kvpList in storage                                      if kvpList  null                                              foreach MyKVPltT, Kgt kvp in kvpList                                                      yield return kvp                                                                                           private int MyGetHashCodeT key                              int i  key.GetHashCode                 if ilt0 ii1                 return i  10000                           public void AddT key, K data                              int value  MyGetHashCodekey                  SizeIfNeededvalue                  is this spot in the hashmap null                 if storage[value]  null                                      create a new chain                     storage[value]  new ListltMyKVPltT, Kgtgt                     storage[value].Addnew MyKVPltT, Kgtkey, data                                  else                                       is this spot taken                     MyKVPltT, Kgt myKvp  Findvalue, key                     if myKvp  null key exists, throw                                              throw new ExceptionThis key exists. no soup for you.                                           if we didnt throw, then add us                     storage[value].Addnew MyKVPltT, Kgtkey, data                                             private MyKVPltT, Kgt Findint value, T key                              foreach MyKVPltT, Kgt kvp in storage[value]                                      if kvp.Key.CompareTokey  0                                              return kvp                                                        return null                           private void SizeIfNeededint value                              if value gt storage.Length                                      ListltMyKVPltT, Kgtgt[] temp  storage                     storage  new ListltMyKVPltT, Kgtgt[value1]                     Array.Copytemp, storage, temp.Length                                            public K this[T key]                               get                                       int value  MyGetHashCodekey                     if value gt storage.Length  throw new IndexOutOfRangeExceptionKey does not exist.

Negative 82352 pI have designed an ecommerce system whereby I have products which can belong to multiple categories. This works well for searching and browsing and allows users to find products more easily.p  pHowever, I have also implemented breadcrumbs on the product page, and I dont know how to determine which category the product should be shown as being in, seeing as it could be any of the categories that the product is in. Ideally I would prefer not to just select a category randomly.p  pDoes anyone have any ideas I would be grateful for only helpp  pThanks, Nicop

Negative 82352 pIve been working on this problem for awhile now, and havent been able to come up with a good solution thusfar.p  pThe problem I have an ordered list of three or more 2D points, and I want to stroke through these with a cubic Bezier curve, in such a way that it looks good. The looks good part is pretty simple I just want the wedge at the second point smoothed out so, for example, the curve doesnt doubleback on itself. So given three points, where should one place the two control points that would surround the second point in the triplet when drawing the curve.p  pMy solution so far is as follows, but is incomplete. The idea might also help communicate the look that Im after.p  pGiven three points, x1,y1, x2,y2, x3,y3. Take the circle inscribed by each triplet of points if they are collinear, we just draw a straight line between them and move on. Take the line tangent to this circle at point x2,y2  we will place the control points that surround x2,y2 on this tangent line.p  pIts the last part that Im stuck on. The problem Im having is finding a way to place the two control points on this tangent line  I have a good enough heuristic on how far from x2,y2 on this line they should be, but of course, there are two points on this line that are that distance away. If we compute the one in the wrong direction, the curve loops around on itself.p  pTo find the center of the circle described by the three points if any of the points have the same x value, simply reorder the points in the calculation belowp  precodedouble ma  point2.y  point1.y  point2.x  point1.x double mb  point3.y  point2.y  point3.x  point2.x CGPoint c  Center of a circle passing through all three points. c.x  ma  mb  point1.y  point3.y  mb  point1.x  point2.x  ma  point2.x  point3.x  2  mb  ma c.y  1  ma  c.x  point1.x  point2.x  2  point1.y  point2.y  2 codepre  pThen, to find the points on the tangent line, in this case, finding the control point for the curve going from point2 to point3p  precodedouble d  ...  distance we want the point.

Negative 82352 pI am designing a UDP protocol which only requires there to be a single client and a single server, however I would like the ability to support multiple clients, or even better, multiple clients on the same machine. p  pWhen a client connects to the server, the server receives the clients IP and outgoing UDP port along with the message. However, I have not had any success in responding to the client via that outgoing port. p  pI guess my question is about what the right way of implementing something like this is, if data is to be sent both ways client to server, and server back to client. It appears to me now that a single socket will not be sufficient, and that both the client and the server must maintain both a listening socket, and a separate sending socket. The sending socket must also be repeatedly opened and closed if the recipient changes. Perhaps the server would have one sending socket per connected client. p  pSince it seems like the outgoing UDP port isnt an actual useful value, I have to keep track of the ports from within my protocol, so that two clients on a particular machine can work out their individual listen ports, relay that to the server, and the server will simply send the data to the appropriate ports after explicitly being informed of what they are.p  pEdit Okay, I dont want the Use TCP answer, even though it may be a valid answer. Ill describe the application a little bit I am controlling hardware remotely in realtime through the internet. I want there to be as little latency as possible, and TCPs data integrity and inorder guarantees are simply not going to help. I just need somebody who is familiar with datagram based netcode to help me make sure that my approach is sane. p
Negative 82352 pIve been stackling and googling for hours. And Im kind of desperate now. I would like to change the language of my application inside the app not only with the default language.p  pFrom what Ive tried I stuck like everybody with the reboot step. Meaning, apples forces you to restart the app manually. Meaning you have to quit the app and then starting it up again.p  pWell, after googling, I was trying to setup an alarm and then forcing later the app to exit withp  precodeexit0 codepre  pMy bad, apple seems not to like this and prevent developer from using it... I guess Im not pointing in the right direction.p  pFinally despite all the problem I could meet I would like to discuss about that.p  pAny hints p  pThanks p  pGp  pEDIT, infos from APPLEp  blockquote   pIn general, you should not change the   iOS system language via use of the   AppleLanguages pref key from within   your application.  This goes against   the basic iOS user model for switching   languages in the Settings app, and   also uses a preference key that is not   documented, meaning that at some point   in the future, the key name could   change, which would break your   application.p      pIf you want to switch languages in   your application, you can do so via   manually loading resource files in   your bundle.  You can use   NSBundlepathForResourceofTypeinDirectoryforLocalization   for this purpose, but keep in mind   that your application would be   responsible for all loading of   localized data.  p      pRegarding the exit0 question, Apple   DTS cannot comment on the app approval   process. You should contact   appreviewapple.com to get an answer   for this question.p blockquote  pWell, I have to choose sofar.p

Negative 82352 pDue to the nature of the way the website I am working on was designed I have an issue I now must resolve.br I will try to write this question as languageindependent but the site is done in ASP.Net with C.  p  h2Overviewh2  pThe structure of our site looks like this for any given objectp  ul liASPX Page  ul liMultiple UserControls ascx    pages ul liTextboxes, Comboboxes, Labels, Buttons, etc.li ulli ulli ul  pWhat this means is, if we have a User page and that page might have 3 UserControls.  One for User Information Name, email, etc., one for Address City, State, Zip, etc. and one for Regional Settings Time zone, language, etc.  p  pAll of these fields on the 3 UserControls are all stored in the same table in the database.  p  pNow, we are using DataBinding and EntityFrameworks to fill in the data and this means that when we save an object, we are actually calling save 3 times 1 per UserControl.  p  blockquote   pLanguageAgnostic We dont actually   assign values like codeUser.Name    Bobcode, it is handled by a Frameworkp blockquote  pBecause the UserControl only knows about the fields it contains, when the Databinding saves it thinks the other fields are now blank. i.e. Address control saves and now Email and Name are null values.  To fix this there is a method called MapOldToNew which goes out and grabs the old record and fills in the values on the New object that is about to be saved.  This is generic, which means we dont have a method on the Address Usercontrol that says go get the Name and Email fields and fill them in, instead it loops through all the properties of the Entityobject and if a value is codeNULLcode on the New object but codeNOT NULLcode on the Old object the one currently in the database about to be overwritten it will make the New value equal to the Old value.  p  h2The Problemh2  pDates.  We allow NULL dates in our database.  p  pIf a User fills in Birthday and saves, they now have a Birthday value in the field in the database.br If they go back and clear out the Birthday field on the web page and save, the codeMapOldToNewcode method grabs the old record, sees that Birthday is not null there and is Null on the New object about to be saved, it will override the New value NULL with the Old value 7231981 for example.  p  h2Solutionsh2  ol liRework our system to not use UserControls but instead have all controls on the same Page, thereby reducing the number of times we need to Save and not requiring codeMapOldToNewcode.  For now, lets assume this is an impossible solution even though it is the one I feel like should be done for plenty of reasons.   li liStore all dates as Strings and do conversion on Load and Save. Strings dont have the same problem because once a string has been modified it is now an empty string, and not NULL   li liDo not allow NULL dates in the database and always store codeDateTime.MinValuecode and do not display it On Load.li ol  pThose are the ideas I have come up with off the top of my head.  For arguments sake, lets assume 1 is not possible because I have a feel management wont like the time it will take to accomplish.  p  pstrongHow would you fix thisstrongp  pstrongAnother Explanationstrong  p  pHere is the problem broken down more. User Record has 2 fields.  Name and Birthdate.br Assume that there is 1 ASPX Page with 2 UserControls ascx.br UserControl1 has a single DatePicker DataBound to BirthDate.br UserControl2 has a single TextBox DataBound to Name.br When UserControl1 calls Update on the ObjectContext the User object it sends looks like thisp  precode Name  NULL, BirthDate  8131980    codepre  pMapOldToNew looks at the Database Record and sees that Name should be Bob so it fills the value in and the record saves.  p  pUserControl2 calls Update now and the User object looks like thisp  precode Name  John, BirthDate  NULL  codepre  pMapOldToNew sees that BirthDate is NULL so it overwrites it with 8131980 from the database and the record saves and the database has the correct values.  p  pNow assume the user goes back in and deletes the BirthDate value.  When UserControl2 calls MapOldToNew, it sees that BirthDate is NULL which the user wants and overwrites it from the Database.br If it DIDNT overwrite it from the database, it would always save it as NULL and the user would never be able to set the BirthDate.p

Negative 82352 pIm looking for the best way to implement the following.p  pI have a MySQL query that analyses performance of a company, and outputs sales, revenue, costs and so on, and basically outputs a final Gross Profit and Net Profit figure. Its working well, and managers can select any date range to run it for, and it will output everything for that range  therefore they can in theory see how the company performed today, yesterday, this week, last month or on the 17th of three months ago... you get the point.p  pThere comes a problem however when some of the figures to be used for the report are variable, and involve fluctuating external costs, such as overheads and so on. I allow users to specify these costs and overheads in a settings table, and the performance query uses these to calculate its figures. But these variable figures represent emnowem, so would bear no relevance if you wanted to look at the company performance from X monthsyears in the past, when the overheads for today are being offset against them, creating inaccuracy.p  pI thought of a couple of solutions.p  ol liI could allow the managers to set a date range to apply the overheads for. For example, for June 2011, the daily overhead was 2000, whereas in July 2011 the overhead is 2250.li liOr I could save the performance reportquery to another table, which would obviously have the variable figure locked in from the time it ran. This could even be automated with a crontab, and perhaps just ran every night.li ol  pWhich way would you recommendp

Negative 82352 pIm using windows 7 and I have 2 networks one wireless with internet connection and one wired with no internet connection. The computer is connected to booth.

Negative 82352 pOK I have a website project within visual studio 2010 running under iis express. The nature of the website is such that an upload folder exists on a shared server and is accessed via a virtual directory within the website..p  pe.g.p  precodeweb server one web root  dwebsmysite web server one virtual dir  documents from sharedserveruploadfolder web server two web root  dwebsmysite web server two virtual dir  documents from sharedserveruploadfolder codepre  pThis setup works just fine and as expected. In the production environment there is no execute access to the folder, it just allows read access to the files.p  pHowever, in the development environment I have an issue. I attach a virtual directory within visual studio and the website runs fine i.e. I can get websitedocumentblah.txt with no problems. However if a file such as a .rpt or .cs is uploaded, when I build the website within visual studio it trawls the virtual directory and detects files it thinks it could build and attempts to build them producing errors p  pIs there a way for me to tell VS not to build the contents of the virtual directoryp  pThanksp

Negative 82352 pI have a nightly SSIS process that exports a TON of data from an AS400 database system.  Due to bugs in the AS400 DB software, ocassional duplicate keys are inserted into data tables.  Every time a new duplicate is added to an AS400 table, it kills my nightly export process.  This issue has moved from being a nuisance to a problem.  p  pWhat I need is to have an option to insert only unique data.  If there are duplicates, select the first encountered row of the duplicate rows.  Is there SQL Syntax available that could help me do this  I know of the strongDISTINCT ROWstrong clause but that doesnt work in my case because for most of the offending records, the entirety of the data is nonunique except for the fields which comprise the PK.p  pIn my case, it is more important for my primary keys to remain unique in my SQL Server DB cache, rather than having a full snapshot of data.  Is there something I can do to force this constraint on the export in SSISSQL Server with out crashing the processp  pstrongEDITstrongp  pLet me further clarify my request.  What I need is to assure that the data in my exported SQL Server tables maintains the same keys that are maintained the AS400 data tables.  In other words, creating a unique Row Count identifier wouldnt work, nor would inserting all of the data without a primary key.p  pIf a bug in the AS400 software allows for mistaken, duplicate PKs, I want to either ignore those rows or, preferably, just select one of the rows with the duplicate key but not both of them.p  pThis SELECT statement should probably happen from the SELECT statement in my SSIS project which connects to the mainframe through an ODBC connection.p  pI suspect that there may not be a simple solution to my problem.  Im hoping, however, that Im wrong.p

Negative 82352 pIm puzzled as to why a JTextField doesnt seem to just clear out by using the setText method on it, when this is coming from a KeyListener. It works fine from an ActionListener, except that, most amazingly, if the KeyListener method tries to invoke the ActionListener method, with a dummy action event created on the fly as a simple test, it still leaves the typed text in place.p  pIn other words, when you run it from the command line, if you type, for example, a 3 into the field, you will see the setTexttest method does not wipe out the 3, as I would expect and desire, but rather leaves it in place. You will then see test3 in the display. I have noted this line with a comment. Clicking the JButton will wipe out the text properly. The JButton and JLabel will change text properly. but the JTextField wont. If you then press the button, you will see that the action event clears out the JTextField properly. Now, if you toggle the commented out line, you can see an attempt to invoke the actionPerformed method from the KeyTyped method And still, when you type a 3 into the text field, it will not get wiped out. I would expect the setText method to clear it out, which it wont.

Negative 82352 pFor a class, a question that was posed by my teacher was the algorithmic cost of multiplying a matrix times its transpose. With the standard 3 loop matrix multiplication algorithm, the efficiency is ON3, and I wonder if there was a way to manipulate or take advantage of matrix  matrix transpose to get a faster algorithm. I understand that when you multiply a matrix by its transpose you have to calculate less of the matrix because its symmetrical, but I cant think of how to manipulate an algorithm that could take less than On3. p  pi know theres algorithms like Coppensmith and Straussen that are faster general matrix multiplication algorithms but could anyone give any hints or insights on how to computationally take advantage of the transpose p  pThanks p

Negative 82352 pWe are using Datamapper in a Sinatra application and would like to use case insensitive like that works on both Sqlite locally in development and Postgresql on Heroku in production.p  pWe have statements like p  precodeTreeItem.allname.like gtterm,unique gt true,limit gt 20 codepre  pIf codetermcodeis BERL we get the suggestion BERLIN from both the Sqlite and Postgresql backends. However if codetermcodeis Berl we only get that result from Sqlite and not Postgresql.p  pI guess this has to do with the fact that both dmpostgresadapter and dmsqliteadapter outputting a codeLIKEcode in the resulting SQL query. Since Postgresql has a case sensitive codeLIKEcode we get this for us unwanted behavior. p  pIs there a way to get case insensitive like in Datamapper without resorting to use a raw SQL query to the adapter or patching the adapter to use codeILIKEcodeinstead of codeLIKEcodep  pI could of course use something in between, such asp  precodeTreeItem.allconditions gt [name LIKE ,term],unique gt true,limit gt 20 codepre  pbut then we would be tied to the use of Postgresql within our own code and not just as a configuration for the adapter.p

Negative 82352 pI currently have an application deployed using Tomcat that interacts with a Postgres database via JDBC. The queries are very expensive, so what Im seeing is a timeout caused by Tomcat or Apache Apache sits in front of Tomcat in my configuration. Im trying to limit the connections to the database to 2030 simultaneous connections, so that the database is not overwhelmed. Ive done this using the .. configuration, setting maxActive to 30 and maxIdle to 20. I also bumped up the maxWait.p  pIn this scenario Im limiting the USE of the database, but I want the connectionsrequests to be POOLED within Tomcat. Apache can accept 250 simultaneous requests. So I need to ensure Tomcat can also accept this many, but handle them appropriately.p  pTomcat has two settings in the strongHTTP Connectorstrong config filep  ul listrongmaxThreadsstrong  Max number of request processing threads to be created by the Http Connector, which therefore determines the max number of simultaneous requests that can be handled.li listrongacceptCountstrong  The maximum queue length for incoming connection requests when all possible request processing threads are in use. Any requests received when the queue is full will be refused.li ul  pSo Im guessing that if I set maxThreads to the max number of JDBC connections 30, then I can set acceptCount to 25030  220. p  pI dont quite understand the difference between a thread that is WAITING on a JDBC connection to open up from the pool, versus a thread that is queued... My thought is that a queued thread is consuming less cycles whereas a running thread, waiting on the JDBC pool, will be spending cycles checking the pool for a free thread...p

Negative 82352 pI have a large matrix from which I would like to randomly extract a smaller matrix.  I want to do this 1000 times, so ultimately it will be in a for loop.

The trick is that I do not want any of the row or column sums in the final matrix to be 0.  Another important thing is that I need to know the original number of the rows and columns in the final matrix.  So, if I end up randomly selecting rows 4, 5, and 7 and columns 1, 3, and 8, I want to have those identifiers easily accessible in the final matrix.p  pHere is what Ive done so far.p  pFirst, I create a vector of row numbers and column numbers.

For some reason, R does not like to subset the matrix this way.p  pSo my question is, is there a better way to subset the matrix by the random vector rand3 after the zero columns have been removed OR is there a better way to randomly select three complementary rows and columns such that there are none that sum to 0p  pThank you so much for your helpp

Negative 82352 pI am trying to build a Rails 3.1 app in which users can preview individual pages of documents or whole documents as a slideshow of pages. Thumbnailing is not a requirement but the ability to show the image at a size that allows reading isp  pThe documents are generated by me and so I control their format. Hence, if it helps to have individual pages as image files, then that can be done. But if its better to have them as PDF, then that is possible too. At any rate, the documents are all housed on a remote server  a VPS perhaps  and they are pulled for preview based on user selection andor permissionsp  pAnd so, I was wondering if anywhere here could make a suggestion for a Gem or a plugin example Cooliris that I could incorporate. I apologize for not being precise enough. But this is one of those times when I dont enough to even start asking the right question. I dont know, for example, what to do a Google search for or whether I really need to set up a media RSS feed  as Cooliris requiresp  pThanks in advance Abhinavp

Negative 82352 pThis seriously is one of the biggest thorns in my side. SFDC does not allow you to use complex objects or collections of objects as parameters to a future call. What is the best workaround for thisp  pCurrently what I have done is passed in multiple parallel arrays of primitives which form a complete object based on the index. Meaning if I need to pass a collections of users, I may pass 3 string arrays, say  Name[], Id[], and Role[].

Negative 82352 pI would like to know what is the best way to communicate between two asp.net user controls which are brothers. The scenario is like this  there is a father contorl, called Main.Aspx, and inside there are two instances of child controls, called  Left.aspx and Right.aspxp  pI would like to send a string from left.aspx to right.aspx, so right.aspx will do some server work on it. As much as I know, javascript functions on both controls are visible to each other, so perhaps JS is the better way to communicate but in that case controls would be less generic Or is it better to use some sort of this.Parent.FindControlRight on server sidep  pThanks aheadp

Negative 82352 pI am working with the AR Drone to develop new application.p  pI want to establish a dependency between two projects. So when I compile one, I hope Xcode will help compile the another one automatically. I had searched with Google for this question. The solutions found are quite old and not applicable for Xcode 4.p  pRight now, I have two project, namely, ARDroneEngine.xcodeproj and FreeFlight.xcodeproj.p  pARDroneEngine is a library for FreeFlight. Here comes the screenshot.p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comQR7Zk.png altenter image description herep  pIf I compile FreeFlight with iPhone  iPad simulator, it is fine since the ARDroneEngine is last compiled with the same setting. This is where the question lies. To test my application, I want to compile and run FreeFlight in my iPhone. So when I change the setting to FreeFlight  xxxs iPhone and compile, the error occurs Apple MachO Linker Error.p  pI think the problem is rooted from the Target Dependencies between two projects. A quick workaround will be Compile the ARDroneEngine again with the new Scheme ARDroneEngine  xxxs iPhone and launch FreeFlight in Xcode for my iPhone.p  pBut I want a more complete solution with the dependencies between projects. If more information is required to solve the problem, I can always provide new info.p  pThanks, Stevenp

Negative 82352 pThis is going to be sort of long and probably more computerscience related than anything language specific though I need to be using Java. You have been warned. p  pIm trying to model the propagation of electrical signals on parallel wires to simulate basic computer hardware. Each path has various elements on it causing for delay, magnification, and other such transformations of my original signals. p  pHere is an image I just made p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comyWgxZ.jpg altA simple example of what Im trying to representp  pThankfully Im not trying to represent any complex signals  just 0s and 1s. In the example there are 4 inputs say the user selects them to be 1011. Then I need to send forward these inputs through the wires and into the gates, with the gates producing the appropriate output and continuing to propagate the signals.p  pThe issue is timing. I assign every wire and every gate a time delay. For example, if the top leftmost wire has a time delay of 0.5, then it takes 0.5 units of time for the first gate to receive the input. Ive draw every gate as multiinput, so the following might happen consider an AND gate input1 arrives in 1.1 units of time, and is high the output is still zero. But then input2 also high had a 1.3 unit delay to get there, so 0.2 units later the output will be recalculated to turn high. In fact each gate itself will have a delay, so say the AND gate takes 0.5 units to compute the final high output will take 1.3  0.5  1.8 units to turn high. p  pThe current programming model I have is this wires and gates are objects which can connect to each other and send a signal forward. For example wireAinput is connected to an actual input and wireAoutput is connected to a gate. So the input signal comes in changes from its previous value, and that action should call the sendsignalwireA, input. This function changes the value on wireA to the input value after wireAdelay. Then wireA does sendsignalgateA, wireAvalue, which causes the gate to recompute its value and then send it forward to the next object after gateAdelay, etc. p  pBut I need propagate signals in parallel  I cant just focus on one serial path So my idea was to make multiple threads for every input. At most Im thinking Ill need 32 input signals, so 32 threads. I would love to schedule them in a roundrobin order for equality, Im not sure if I can do this with the JVM. Either way theyll all get the same priority. p  pNow the ith input thread does what I describe above  it propagates down the signal. But what happens when a path branches out to many paths p  pIts important to note that gates can have multiple fan outs, i.e. links to other places from their output. That value will typically be 4 at most. So after gateA gets set, it knows that it needs to call sendsignalwireBE, gateAvalue 4 times, one for each of its fanouts. p  pIdeally I would like to not branch out to different threads, that would really suck and probably be impossible for larger designs, but hey maybe the whole notion of threads was unnecessary in the first place. I dont need to simulate at ridiculous speeds, just enough to appear responsive to the human user. p  pSo back to my possible implementation  an input thread is propagating along a serial path until BAM  it branches out to 4 different paths. Heres my idea let the same thread have the 4 paths, for now. Each path has its own delay ex 1.4, 2.2, 3.6,  1.1. Multiply each delay by 100, and loop through N iterations where N corresponds to the max delay in this case 360. At various checkpoints in the loop corresponding to the other delays i  110, 140, 220, propagate those various paths one step forward i.e. send the signal to the immediate next object on the path. But then we need to add this object to the looping list and count for the appropriate  of iterations again before we propagate further down that particular path. p  pWhen the 1 to 4 path has all 4 paths branching out to 4 more paths and so on and so on, then Im sort of screwed but maybe this approach is enough to get me started p  pAgain I may be coming at this problem from the complete wrong direction, and Im willing to step back and rethink it. Hence why Im asking you guys.p  pThank you very much for any input at all, or even reading this damn thing. Cheers.p

Negative 82352 pHaving a very frustrating time solving this issue. I have a model which automatically stores a users latitude and longitude. Im trying to use that information to place markers on a Google Map for each instance of that model. Seems simple enough. Using JavaScript appears the simplest way and Django template tags can apparently be placed within script tags as long as these are on the template. Looping through the model, though, doesnt appear to be working. Theres likely just a simple error here but my JavaScript is weak and Firebug illustrating what exactly is wrong.p  pIs something simple missing Perhaps theres a better way to do this through a specific Django view or a Python wrapper that works better for this purpose Any insight or expertise is greatly appreciated.p  pHeres the pagep  precode extends base.html    block pagetitle Stentorian endblock   block headline Stentorian Storyline endblock     block content   ltdiv classrowgt     ltdiv classspan12gt          lth2gtWelcome lta href url profilesprofiledetail user.username gt user.username ltagtlth2gt ltbr gt                        ltdiv idmapcanvas stylewidth 300px height 200px borderright 1px solid 666666 borderbottom 1px solid 666666 bordertop 1px solid AAAAAA borderleft 1px solid AAAAAAgtltdivgt ltbr gt          ltdiv classaccordion idstoryaccordiongt            for story in stories              ltdiv classaccordiongroupgt                 ltdiv classaccordionheadinggt                     lta classaccordiontoggle storyheader datatogglecollapse dataparentstoryaccordion hrefstory story.id gt                          story.author    story.title    story.date                      ltagt                 ltdivgt                 ltdiv idstory story.id  classaccordionbody collapse if forloop.counter0  0  in endif gt                          ltdiv classaccordioninnergt                             lt lth2gtlta href url detail story.id gtstory.titleltagtlth2gtgt                              ltspangtlta href url profilesprofiledetail story.author.username gtstory.authorltagt ltspangtltbrgt                              ltspangtstory.topicltspangtltbrgt                             ltspangtstory.zipcodeltspangtltbrgt                              ltspangtstory.dateltspangtltbrgt                              ltpgtstory.copyltpgt                         ltdivgt                     ltdivgt                 ltdivgt                  ltbrgt                 endfor              ltdivgt          ltdivgt     ltdivgt ltscriptgt function mainGeo               if navigator.geolocation                             navigator.geolocation.getCurrentPosition mainMap, error, maximumAge 30000, timeout 10000, enableHighAccuracy true                   else                        alertSorry, but it looks like your browser does not support geolocation.                       var map         function mainMapposition                   Define the coordinates as a Google Maps LatLng Object            var coords  new google.maps.LatLngposition.coords.latitude, position.coords.longitude              Prepare the map options            var mapOptions                                   zoom 15,                       center coords,                       mapTypeControl false,                       navigationControlOptions style google.maps.NavigationControlStyle.SMALL,                       mapTypeId google.maps.MapTypeId.ROADMAP                            Create the map, and place it in the mapcanvas div             map  new google.maps.Mapdocument.getElementByIdmapcanvas, mapOptions               Place the initial marker             var marker  new google.maps.Marker                       position coords,                       map map,                       title Your current location                         function error              alertYou have refused to display your location.

Negative 82352 pI have a DLL that takes 5 to 10 seconds to load, which means that I have to wait that long every time I compile and run the executable that uses it. Is there a way to keep the DLL loaded in memory so that it can be immediately accessed every time I compile the corresponding executable Im compiling the program on QT MinGW, if thats relevant.p  pEDIT No luck so far. Loading the DLL on another program seems to have no effect the original program still loads the DLL, and takes just as long to do so. I would guess I need to load the DLL and its functions differently if theyve been loaded into another program, but I dont know how to do this. Right now Im using LoadLibrary and GetProcAddress.p

Negative 82352 pIve got a queue object which plays quite an important part in my project and I cant afford for there to be any bugs in it.p  pThe idea of it is to be like the builtin codeQueuecode, its base class, but it stores the data, or part of it at least in a file to preserve memory. I decided to keep some of it in memory as this should speed things up. I have put the code a hrefhttpsgithub.comGP89BufferedGzipQueue relnofollowherea, it might be easier to see it than for me to explain itp  pIt may seem an odd thing to want to do but I need to queue up a lot of work, which queues up much faster than I can get through it, and it will use far too much memory if I used a standard codeQueuecode. I cant just put a maxsize on the codeQueuecode and block the worker putting things in the queue as I want to know the total amount of data to process as soon as possible. I also cant work out a total first, but not queue it and then go back through putting in the codeQueuecode as the total will be different each time I go through the data, and at the end the totals wont match.p  pMy question is how can I test this thoroughly to be sure that theres no items being lost or more importantly any blocking on a getter when theres items still in the buffer or the file, or after complete has been called and the queue is empty.p  pSome things seem very easy to test and set up unit tests for when you know what the output should be for some given input, but testing something like this Im not really sure of an effective way to do it. Is it possible to test this kind of thing with unit testsp  pIve set up a test program that puts and gets items in at different, varying speeds of different number of items and it seems fine, but Ive seen evidence of a getter blocking on code.getcode with items still in the queue, so Im lead to believe there is a problem.p  pWhats the best way I can test this thoroughly to find any remaining bugs or be near certain its bug freep  h2EDITh2  pCan generate some test data similar to what I use with the following code, I only have the checksum for a file under certain conditions in the project and other times it is codeNonecode so I just generate it some of the time in the code below to try and simulate thatp  precodeimport os import hashlib  def hashfobj     md5  hashlib.md5     while True         data  fobj.read8192         if not data             break         md5.updatedata     return md5.hexdigest  def produceatonce,totalitems     items[]     count0     for dir,folders,files in os.walk         for f in files             try                 fpath os.path.joindir,f                 fsize os.path.getsizefpath                 fmtime os.path.getmtimefpath                 with openfpath as fileobj                     fhash hashfileobj if fsize2 else None                 items.appendfpath,fsize,fmtime,fhash                 count1             except Exception as err                 print ,err,             if lenitems gt atonce                 yield items                 items[]         if count gt totalitems             break     if items         yield items codepre

Negative 82352 pIve recently installed VS2008 on a new machine, and now find that it will not link with DLLs built on an older machine, giving error LNK2001 unresolved external symbol forceCRTManifestCUR.  I presume that this pertains to an issue with SideBySide.p  pHaving researched a little, I now suspect that the issue is that the old VS2008 installation is upgraded to version 9.0.30729.4462 QFE, whereas the new VS2008 installation is on 9.0.21022.8 RTM.p  pOn researching further, I read that I needed to install SQL Server 2008 to at least SP1 in order to upgrade VS2008 to the later version.  I installed SQL Server 2008 on the new machine however, and it is now at SR3, yet VS2008 is still on version 9.0.21022.8.  I suspect that the SQL Server that I installed was preservicepacked up to SR2, and that this might be the problem.p  pWindows Microsoft Update shows no pending updates for either SQL Server 2008 or Visual Studio 2008.p  pPlease can you suggest a way of forcing Visual Studio to upgrade to the 9.0.30729.4462 QFE versionp  pAlternatively, are there any other solutions to this problem that dont involve recompiling all of my precompiled DLLsp

Negative 82352 pI have a C program that was handed down to me by a developer who left. I am trying to figure out exactly what he had goign on and get the software rearranged into something more logical so I can build it easier. I am using CMake to build, whereas he was using Make.p  pThere is one src folder that had several source files in it, and out of those, about 4 had main methods. The files with the main methods are in files that are named more as if they are utilities, or  tools, or whatever. This kind of strikes me as odd, because he also had a lib folder, with some other things in it that were built and looked more like libraries. Should I split out those main methods into driver source files, and make the methods that are also defined in those files to be other libraries If I do this, I know how to make CMake go look for a library and build and link it to the driver for execution.p  pIf it is acceptable to build those library source files where they are, in the src folder, should I just set CMake up to build everything in that folder all at once, or should I create a directory structure for at least some logical separation p  pJust as an idea, here is the current directory structurep  precodeproject ...src ......file1.c ......file2.c lthas a main as well as other methods ......file3.c ......file4.c lt has a main as well as other methods ......file5.c ...lib ......lib1 .........file1.c ltreferences top level include folder files .........file2.c ......lib2 .........file1.c ltrefs top level and local include files .........file2.c .........file2.h ...scripts ...include . . . codepre  pAny advice on best practices for restructuring this build or configuring it in CMake is appreciated.p

Negative 82352 pIm using the Razor template engine in a C console app and trying to expand an object tree to a text file.  Im having some difficulty figuring out how to get hierarchical expansion to work.p  pIt is probable that I have completely misunderstood how hierarchical template expansion is supposed to work in Razor.  I need to know if my current approach is almost right and just needs fixing, or if I am doing it completely the wrong way, then what is the right way of doing thisp  pBonus question Is Razor the right tool for this or is there a better alternativep  pI have created a small test app to demonstrate the problem.  The class codeTemplateTreeModelcode defines the model that is passed into Razor.  This class defines a tree, the codeChildrencode member is a list of child codeTemplateTreeModelcode instances.p  pI want to instance the model and pass it into Razor like thisp  precodevar model  new TemplateTreeModel ... add children to the tree ... var expanded  Razor.ParseTemplate, model codepre  pcodeTemplateTreeModelcode has a member function codeExpandChildrencode that does the hierarchical expansion.  I use it within the template like thisp  precodeModel.ExpandChildren codepre  pMy test app generates very odd results.  Some of the leaf nodes are repeated in the output and only level 3 nodes are present.  The root node level 1 and the level 2 nodes are missing from the output.p  pUpdate For some more context on this, the real use case for this is that I want to generate code from an abstract syntax tree.  So I have a bunch of templates that represent the script to output for each AST node.  I then want to expand recursively from the root AST node to translate the AST into a script file.p  pFollowing is the full code for the test app.  To get this working you need to put the code in a C console app and reference RazorEngine available here a hrefhttprazorengine.codeplex.com relnofollowhttprazorengine.codeplex.coma.p  precodeusing System using System.Collections.Generic using System.Text using RazorEngine using RazorEngine.Templating  namespace RazorTest      public class Program              public class TemplateTreeModel                      private static int nextID  1              public TemplateTreeModelstring template, int level                              this.Level  level                 this.ID  nextID                 this.Template  template                 this.Children  new ListltTemplateTreeModelgt                           public int Level  get private set              public int ID  get private set              public string Template  get private set              public ListltTemplateTreeModelgt Children  get private set               public string ExpandChildren                              var output  new StringBuilder                  foreach var child in this.Children                                      output.Appendchild.Expand                                   return output.ToString                           public string Expand                              var expanded  Razor.Parsethis.Template, this                 return expanded                           public TemplateTreeModel DefineChildTemplateTreeModel child                              this.Children.Addchild                 return this                                public static void Mainstring[] args                      try                              var template  Node Model.ID Level Model.LevelnModel.ExpandChildrenn                 var root                      new TemplateTreeModeltemplate, 1.

Negative 82352 pI have a Symfony2 form with an input text field that I hide with jQuery to use an autocomplete field in its place the css of the input field is set to display none. Given that the field is required, when I try to submit the form without making a selection, I get a validation error message as expected. However, the problem Im running into is that the HTML5 clientside validation error shows up bubbles up outside of the browsers window attached to the lower left corner, instead of where the autocomplete field is located. That happens because the input field that sets the position of the error bubble is hidden.p  pIs there a simple way to attach the error bubble from HTML5 form validation to another element so that it shows up in the correct position Perhaps attach it to the input fields label instead of the widget or to the ul element created with the jQuery plugin To give a little context, Im using the a hrefhttploopj.comjquerytokeninput relnofollowLoopj Tokeninput jQuery plugina, that creates a ul element in place of the forms input text field setting the style of the latter to display none.p

Negative 82352 pI am doing some work updating a data access library that our company uses to call stored procedures on an Oracle database.  The library currently allows the calling application to use a single OracleCommand IDbCommand object and a single OracleConnection IDBConnection to make several calls.  This means the caller would add parameters for a call, make the call, clear the parameters and repeat.  When finished, the consumer application calls dispose to clean everything up.p  pI can make things much cleaner by using using statements within the library to make sure the command and connection objects are cleaned up after each call but this would mean the above functionality would be lost and a new commandconnection would be created per call. I see this being done in most examples I find, but then they are usually only simple examples.p  pMy question Is it worthwhile to allow the command andor the connection to persist between calls  Is it overly expensive to recreate them each timep

Negative 82352 pI have come across a funny permissions issue with nested views that I dont think is caused by ownership chaining.  All servers mentioned are SQL Server 2008 R2.p  pI have a linked server that is configured to use a specific login, say, Bill.  On my remote server I have a view, lets call it codeViewAcode, which in turn selects from another view, lets call it codeViewBcode.p  pI can do a select through the linked server which works just finep  precodeSELECT  FROM [LINKEDSERVER].[DATABASE].[SCHEMA].[VIEWA] codepre  pThis returns a happy result set, no problem.p  pNow, I have a stored procedure which is attempting to query from the same view.  It is using the same linked server, remember, which is using the same login, Bill.  p  pWhen I codeEXECUTEcode the stored procedure through management studio, which in turn queries codeViewAcode through the linked server, I getp  blockquote   pemSELECT permission denied on ViewB.emp blockquote  pThe login that the linked server is using, Bill, is part of a role which has explicit access to codeView Acode. Both views are part of the same schema, and all objects are owned by dbo.  p  pNotice it is not complaining about codeViewAcode, which Bill has explicit rights to, but codeViewBcode, which Bill should have rights to because of ownership chaining.p  pI dont understand why I can query through the Bill Linked Server directly, but the stored procedure fails.p  pAny ideasp

Negative 82352 pI am writing a java simulation application which has a lot of entities to simulate. Each of these entities has a certain state at any time in the system. A possible and natural approach to model such an entity would be using the a hrefhttpen.wikipedia.orgwikiStatepattern relnofollowstate or state machinea pattern. The problem is that it creates a lot of objects during the runtime if there are a lot of state switches, what might cause bad system performance. What design alternatives do I have I want performance to be the main criteria after maintainability.p  pThanksp

Negative 82352 pstrongOriginalstrongp  pthis is my first time asking a question on stackoverflow so i hope the solution isnt too blazingly obvious. I am trying to use antlr to parse data from an xml file to generate usable tokens for a java program i am creating in eclipse. I only have experience using antlr with the antlrworks IDE to generate the java code i need to incorporate. The thing is, is that my xml file is very large and complex, and so to start off with, i am only interested in looking at a few attributes at a time. To make things simpler for me, i am attempting to use the filter option to sift through and grab only the data that matches my token definitions. I realize that the filter option can only be used if you are defining your parser and lexer grammar separately, but when i tried to adapt my combined grammar, i suddenly started getting error after error complaining about missing or unwanted tokens, I have been pulling my hair out trying to understand why one works and not the other. I have them saved in the same file, and removing the options statement does nothing to fix the issue.p  pHere is my combined grammar, followed by my adapted grammar, if anyone can offer me any help or direction i would be so grateful.p  pstrongCombinedstrongp  precodegrammar dataExtract  prog        .

The parser grammar seems to work just fine, and antlrworks even generates a Java class without complaining, however, the lexer rules seem to break still when i save the lexer definition in its own .g file, even if the only rule i define is All      ., i get an EarlyExitException. Also, if i understand correctly, the tokenVocab option searches for the token file from the lexer grammar, but since i am getting an error and it is not generating any code, there is no token file created yet, and so i would assume that the parser should not be generated correctly without it. Any idea what is happening I have tried searching similar issues but alot of the material seems to assert that this error is caused when no tokens are found in the input that match the rules, but since i havent even gotten to the point where i am giving it input this cant be the case.p

Negative 82352 pIm writing a crossplatform .NET library that uses some unmanaged code.

On windows, this works fine with codeLoadLibrarycode from kernel32.dll.  Im trying to do the same with codedlopencode on Linux, but I get a codeDllNotFoundExceptioncode when it comes to loading the PInvoke methods later on.p  pI have verified that the library libindexfile.so is successfully saved to the temp directory and that the call to codedlopencode succeeds.  I delved into the a hrefhttpsgithub.commonomonoblob1429f06a9e3baf56245ec2433dcdb77e76eba684monometadataloader.cL565mono sourcea to try figure out what is going on, and I think it might boil down to whether or not a subsequent call to codedlopencode will just reuse a previously loaded library.

Negative 82352 pAfter attempting to add multithreading functionality in a Haskell program, I noticed that performance didnt improve at all. Chasing it down, I got the following data from threadscopep  pimg srchttpi.imgur.comPlxz8.png altGraph 1 Green indicates running, and orange is garbage collection. img srchttpi.imgur.comd31qp.png altGraph 2 img srchttpi.imgur.comcv0dM.png altGraph 3 Here vertical green bars indicate spark creation, blue bars are parallel GC requests, and light blue bars indicate thread creation. img srchttpi.imgur.comU4ILV.png altGraph 4 The labels are spark created, requesting parallel GC, creating thread n, and stealing spark from cap 2.p  pOn average, Im only getting about 25 activity over 4 cores, which is no improvement at all over the singlethreaded program.p  pOf course, the question would be void without a description of the actual program. Essentially, I create a traversable data structure e.g. a tree, and then fmap a function over it, before then feeding it into an image writing routine explaining the unambiguously singlethreaded segment at the end of the program run, past 15s. Both the construction and the fmapping of the function take a significant amount of time to run, although the second slightly more so.p  pThe above graphs were made by adding a parTraversable strategy for that data structure before  it is consumed by the image writing. I have also tried using toList on the data structure and then using various parallel list strategies parList, parListChunk, parBuffer, but the results were similar each time for a wide range of parameters even using large chunks.br I also tried to fully evaluate the traversable data structure before fmapping the function over it, but the exact same problem occurred.p  pHere are some additional statistics for a different run of the same programp  precode   5,702,829,756 bytes allocated in the heap      385,998,024 bytes copied during GC       55,819,120 bytes maximum residency 8 samples        1,392,044 bytes maximum slop              133 MB total memory in use 0 MB lost due to fragmentation                                      Tot time elapsed  Avg pause  Max pause    Gen  0     10379 colls, 10378 par    5.20s    1.40s     0.0001s    0.0327s   Gen  1         8 colls,     8 par    1.01s    0.25s     0.0319s    0.0509s    Parallel GC work balance 1.24 96361163  77659897, ideal 4                          MUT time elapsed       GC time  elapsed   Task  0 worker     0.00s     15.92s       0.02s      0.02s   Task  1 worker     0.27s     14.00s       1.86s      1.94s   Task  2 bound     14.24s     14.30s       1.61s      1.64s   Task  3 worker     0.00s     15.94s       0.00s      0.00s   Task  4 worker     0.25s     14.00s       1.66s      1.93s   Task  5 worker     0.27s     14.09s       1.69s      1.84s    SPARKS 595854 595854 converted, 0 overflowed, 0 dud, 0 GCd, 0 fizzled    INIT    time    0.00s    0.00s elapsed   MUT     time   15.67s   14.28s elapsed   GC      time    6.22s    1.66s elapsed   EXIT    time    0.00s    0.00s elapsed   Total   time   21.89s   15.94s elapsed    Alloc rate    363,769,460 bytes per MUT second    Productivity  71.6 of total user, 98.4 of total elapsed codepre  pIm not sure what other useful information I can give to assist answering.

Negative 82352 pIve researched previous posts which say that basically the API is read only, these were back in 2010.

Negative 82352 pI have recently been writing a Java NIO based server with nonblocking sockets and Ive bumped in to some problems in regarding writing the data out. I know by now that there are conditions where nonblocking write fails to write some, or all of the bytes in a ByteBuffer. p  pThe way I currently handle such scenario is by either rewinding or compacting the buffer and later trying to send it again in next selection iteration. This how ever results in significant performance loss and it is imperative that I get the data sent fast.p  pI have attempted using something like p  precodeByteBuffer bb  ... SocketChannel sc  ... whilebb.remaining gt 0    sc.writebb    codepre  pBut the problem with this is the fact that it might write 0 bytes and still quit the while loop. Im not sure why, but it seems like write  method will hit ByteBuffers limit regardless of whether it actually sent all the bytes or not.p  pAnother problem Ive had with this writing method is when it sometimes under heavy load will cause a buffer overflow exception even when Im not attempting a blocking write.p  pI desperately need some advice on how to properly perform blocking write and what condition might cause SocketChannel.writeByteBuffer to overflow the buffershould it not stop when limit is hit.p  pThanks in advance.p  pEdit I still have not found the reason why sc.writebb would set position in buffer to bb.limit even if it wrote 0 bytes. My only resort remain to be rewinding the buffer after failed write attempt.p

Negative 82352 pI had an eclipse project that was taking around a minute to assemble the war file. There was a huge amount of javascript code50mb that wasnt actually necessary anymore so I stripped it out. When I did this, it went from taking a minute and a half to assemble the war to taking 5 seconds. p  pI assume that the extra time was spent compressing the javascript code. While this makes sense, there are plenty of other static files being included in the war that dont seem to be causing a delay. Theyre mostly jpeg files, so I assume that the war generation process knows not to compress jpegs.p  pIs there a list of what files do and dont get compressed, and is this list configurablep

Negative 82352 pAlright, Im trying to implement a simple 2D matrix class right now. This is what it looks like so farp  precodetemplate lttypename Typegt class dyMatrix      private         Type mat          int width, height         int length      public         dyMatrix int width, int height              widthwidth, heightheight, mat0                      length  width  height             mat  new Type[length]                              int getWidth              return width                   int getHeight              return height                   int getLength              return length                              Typeamp operator int i, int j              return mat[j  width  i]                   Typeamp operator int i              return mat[i]                              dyMatrix              delete[] mat           codepre  pTo test it, and compare with static multidimensional arrays, I wrote the following snippet of codep  precodeinclude ltiostreamgt using namespace std   matrix class goes here   struct Coord      int x, y      Coord          x0, y0           Coord int x, int y          xx, yy           void print          cout ltlt x ltlt ,  ltlt y        int main      dyMatrixltCoordgt adabo5, 7     Coord inakos[5][7]      int i  5, j  0      adaboi, j  new Coordi, j     inakos[i][j]  new Coordi, j      inakos[i][j].print     adaboi, j.print      return 0  codepre  pAdabo and Inakos being arbitrarily chosen names. Upon execution, codeinakoscode prints its contents but the program crashes before codeadabocode can do anything. Another interesting thing is that, if I give codeicode and codejcode values other than 5 and 0, like 5 and 1, respectively, it works fine.p  pI dont know what exact numbers work and which make the program go haywire, I only know that theres a irregularity here. What am I possibly doing wrong Im an amateur at C, so I may or not have misused something in any of the structures.p  pIf anyone also has the time, Id very much like to know if theres any other error of notice in my matrix class. Anything thats not possibly related to the problem, but is a fallacy nevertheless.p  pIve also tested it with the following main, but it still crashes after codeinakoscode prints its contents in [5][1]. Maybe it has to do not with dyMatrix, but a looselyimplemented Coordp  precodeint main      dyMatrixltCoordgt adabo5, 7     Coord inakos[5][7]      for int i  0 i lt adabo.getHeight i          for int j  0 j lt adabo.getWidth j              adaboi, j  new Coordi, j             inakos[i][j]  new Coordi, j              inakos[i][j].print             cout ltlt                    cout ltlt nn          cout ltlt nnn      Coord temp     for int i  0 i lt 7 i          for int j  0 j lt 5 j              temp  adaboi, j              temp.print             cout ltlt                    cout ltlt nn           return 0  codepre  pedit It hasnt to do with Coord.

Negative 82352 pI am currently having trouble including resources from the NDK manifest file and I am sure that it is a quick fix error. There are plenty of files that are shared between projects and operating systems in a large library.  Therefore, in order to keep the files up to date with other projects and keep from updating each individual project with the latest API each time an update occurs, a whole bunch of native header and source code files need to be referenced with relative paths.p  pWithin Eclipse, I have clicked and dragged across the files without copying them, but by using a relative path that would be needed by the current application in a local folder structure in the project.p  prepprojectFolder    jni       externalProjectFiles          src          include pre  pWith this folder structure within Eclipse I have an Android.mk file with the following structurep  precodeLOCALPATH  call mydir  include CLEARVARS  LOCALMODULE  projectLib  LIBRARYSRCFOLDER    wildcard LOCALPATHexternalProjectFilessrc.cpp  LOCALCINCLUDES  LOCALPATHexternalProjectFilesinclude  LOCALSRCFILES   projectLibNDK.c LOCALSRCFILES   LIBRARYSRCFOLDERLOCALPATH  LOCALLDLIBS     LSYSROOTusrlib llog landroid LOCALCFLAGS      Wnomultichar DANDROID DLIBDIRc  LOCALCFLAGS      DUSETCPLOOPBACK DMDNSUDSSERVERPATHvarrunmdnsd DINLIBRARY DBUILDINGLIBICONV DUSEBONJOUR  LOCALCFLAGS      DXRTARGETANDROID DKSBUILDINGKS Wnopsabi Wnomultichar DGNUSOURCE DHAVEIPV60 DNOTHAVESALEN  LOCALCFLAGS      DUSESNETLINK DHAVELINUX DTARGETOSLINUX LOCALCPPFLAGS    frtti fexceptions  include BUILDSHAREDLIBRARY codepre  pHowever, when I attempt to include the first header in the projectLibNDC.c it prints the error of bNo such file or directoryb. pcodeinclude externalFile.hcodep  pIs the approach that I am taking a possible solution  br Do I have to provide the relative paths in the Android.mk file itself for the files  That would be a bit more of a hassle instead of referencing a local folder of referenced files.brp  pIn theory, it sounds as though I would be able to create a library through the NDK in this manner.  But, perhaps I am not setting up the project properly.  Any aide would be helpful JNI has a tendency to throw me around on occasion.pp  pbEDITb  It would seem that Eclipse which is an amazing IDE does not have any glue behind the references to the linked files that it keeps in its project settings.  If I drag referenced files into the project, there are no physical files put into those folders to represent a linked files existence.  That information is only stored in project settings apparently.  Which is not helpful for the Android.mk file.brbr This means that any scripts or makefiles would not have any reference as to what files are supposed to be included.  Unfortunately, I will have to reference folders and files individually from the makefile itself.  I might leave the references in the project as a hint to their existence from other programmers.  Unfortunate that I cannot design it that way, but that is the conclusion that I have received thus far.p

Negative 82352 pI only begin to learn Haskell. Ive read that it is a pure functional language and everything in it is immutable.

Negative 82352 pI have codeUITableViewControllercode with static grouped cells. In a particular view, I want to remove some of the cells.  If I just hide them, it leaves an empty space, so I want to set the cells coderowHeightcode to code0code instead.  Im having trouble doing this because I cant seem to get the indexPath of the cell I want to hide.  I have a reference to it via IB connection.

Negative 82352 pI have an IIShosted WCF service that connects to a SQL database backend using Entity Framework 4.1.  Occasionally, I will receive the following exceptionp  blockquote   pAn EdmType cannot be mapped to CLR classes multiple times.  The   EdmType Model.EmailTemplate is mapped more than once. An item with   the same key has already been added.p blockquote  pThis happens rarely enough that Im not sure its even always the same class, but theres definitely nothing special about the class mentioned above, and it definitely does not appear in the edmx more than once  I believe it simply blames the first class it tries to access after whatever happens that sends Entity Framework off the rails.p  pThe model is generated from the database tables using the designer and doesnt have any complicated mappings or anything.p  pWhen this happens, it will continue to throw that exception until I do an iisreset, and then when it comes back up its perfectly happy.p  pThis does not appear to be happening in production as far as Im aware, but it has been happening in both dev and test, two different environments with different SQL server instances.  In both cases, doing an iisreset makes it go away until the next time it becomes offended.p  pI cant reproduce this consistently enough to be sure when it happens and what is causing it.  However, there are two possible things I can think ofp  ul lipThe WCF service and a win32 service share the same assemblies and configuration files to connect to the same database.  I guess its possible some sort of occasional combination of timing between the two of them is annoying one of them, but theyre different processes and using different credentials so Im not sure how they could be affecting each other...pli lipThere is a point where it talks to a second separate database, on which it calls some stored procedures using codeSqlCommand.ExecuteReadercode.  It instantiates an EF context just to call codeObjectContext.TranslateltResultSetTypegtreadercode.  The result set types that call takes as generic parameters arent types that are mapped in the context and notably nothing to do with the type mentioned in the exception above, theyre just POCO. Nor are they even connecting to the same database as the object context is on, as the appropriate SqlDataReader is already ready to roll.  The object context is just used as a convenient way of automatically translating entities from the other database.  This call would be static if a static codeTranslateltTgtDbDataReadercode existed.  This is probably whats tripping it up, as its a bit of a hack and probably doesnt appreciate being used that way... but the block is wrapped in a using with a TransactionScopeOption.Suppress using directly inside it, so I still feel like it shouldnt have this effect on subsequent calls made with other contexts instantiated later...pli ul  pAnyone ever run into anything like thisp  pstrongEdited to addstrong  It is a MappingException, and the stacktrace is below.p  precodeat System.Data.Metadata.Edm.ObjectItemCollection.LoadAssemblyFromCacheObjectItemCollection objectItemCollection, Assembly assembly, Boolean loadReferencedAssemblies, EdmItemCollection edmItemCollection, Action1 logLoadMessage    at System.Data.Metadata.Edm.ObjectItemCollection.ImplicitLoadAssemblyForTypeType type, EdmItemCollection edmItemCollection    at System.Data.Metadata.Edm.MetadataWorkspace.ImplicitLoadAssemblyForTypeType type, Assembly callingAssembly    at System.Data.Objects.ELinq.ExpressionConverter.TryGetValueLayerTypeType linqType, TypeUsageampamp type    at System.Data.Objects.ELinq.ExpressionConverter.GetCastTargetTypeTypeUsage fromType, Type toClrType, Type fromClrType, Boolean preserveCastForDateTime    at System.Data.Objects.ELinq.ExpressionConverter.CreateCastExpressionDbExpression source, Type toClrType, Type fromClrType    at System.Data.Objects.ELinq.ExpressionConverter.ConvertTranslator.TranslateUnaryExpressionConverter parent, UnaryExpression unary, DbExpression operand    at System.Data.Objects.ELinq.ExpressionConverter.UnaryTranslator.TypedTranslateExpressionConverter parent, UnaryExpression linq    at System.Data.Objects.ELinq.ExpressionConverter.TypedTranslator1.TranslateExpressionConverter parent, Expression linq      at System.Data.Objects.ELinq.ExpressionConverter.TranslateExpressionExpression linq    at System.Data.Objects.ELinq.ExpressionConverter.MemberInitTranslator.TypedTranslateExpressionConverter parent, MemberInitExpression linq    at System.Data.Objects.ELinq.ExpressionConverter.TypedTranslator1.TranslateExpressionConverter parent, Expression linq    at System.Data.Objects.ELinq.ExpressionConverter.TranslateExpressionExpression linq    at System.Data.Objects.ELinq.ExpressionConverter.TranslateLambdaLambdaExpression lambda, DbExpression input    at System.Data.Objects.ELinq.ExpressionConverter.TranslateLambdaLambdaExpression lambda, DbExpression input, DbExpressionBindingampamp binding    at System.Data.Objects.ELinq.ExpressionConverter.MethodCallTranslator.OneLambdaTranslator.TranslateExpressionConverter parent, MethodCallExpression call, DbExpressionampamp source, DbExpressionBindingampamp sourceBinding, DbExpressionampamp lambda    at System.Data.Objects.ELinq.ExpressionConverter.MethodCallTranslator.SelectTranslator.TranslateExpressionConverter parent, MethodCallExpression call    at System.Data.Objects.ELinq.ExpressionConverter.MethodCallTranslator.SequenceMethodTranslator.TranslateExpressionConverter parent, MethodCallExpression call, SequenceMethod sequenceMethod    at System.Data.Objects.ELinq.ExpressionConverter.MethodCallTranslator.TypedTranslateExpressionConverter parent, MethodCallExpression linq    at System.Data.Objects.ELinq.ExpressionConverter.TypedTranslator1.TranslateExpressionConverter parent, Expression linq    at System.Data.Objects.ELinq.ExpressionConverter.TranslateExpressionExpression linq    at System.Data.Objects.ELinq.ExpressionConverter.Convert    at System.Data.Objects.ELinq.ELinqQueryState.GetExecutionPlanNullable1 forMergeOption    at System.Data.Objects.ObjectQuery1.GetResultsNullable1 forMergeOption    at System.Data.Objects.ObjectQuery1.System.Collections.Generic.IEnumerableampltTampgt.GetEnumerator    at System.Collections.ObjectModel.ObservableCollection1.CopyFromIEnumerable1 collection    at System.Collections.ObjectModel.ObservableCollection1..ctorIEnumerable1 collection codepre

Negative 82352 pI guess the answer is no, but from a compiler point of view, I dont understand why.p  pI made a very simple code which freaks out compiler diagnostics quite badly both clang and gcc, but I would like to have confirmation that the code is not ill formatted before I report misdiagnostics. I should point out that these are strongnot compiler bugsstrong, the output is correct in all cases, but I have doubts about the warnings.p  pConsider the following codep  precodeinclude ltiostreamgt  int main   int b,a   b  3   b  3  a  1  b  2   b  2  a  2  b  1   a  a   stdcerr ltlt a ltlt stdendl  codepre  pThe assignment of codeacode is a tautology, meaning that codeacode will be initialized after the two ternary statements, regardless of codebcode. GCC is perfectly happy with this code. Clang is slighly more clever and spot something silly codewarning explicitly assigning a variable of type int to itself [Wselfassign]code, but no big deal.p  pNow the same thing semantically at least, but shorter syntaxp  precodeinclude ltiostreamgt  int main   int b,a  b3,               b  3  a  1  b  2,               b  2  a  2  b  1,               a   stdcerr ltlt a ltlt stdendl  codepre  pNow the compilers give me completely different warnings. Clang doesnt report anything strange anymore which is probably correct because of the parenthesis precedence. gcc is a bit more scary and saysp  precodetest.cpp In function int main test.cpp715 warning operation on a may be undefined [Wsequencepoint] codepre  pBut is that true That sequencepoint warning gives me a hint that coma separated statements are not handled in the same way in practice, but I dont know if they should or not.p  pAnd it gets weirder, changing the code top  precodeinclude ltiostreamgt  int main   int b,a  b3,               b  3  a  1  b  2,               b  2  a  2  b  1,               a0  lt i just changed this line   stdcerr ltlt a ltlt stdendl  codepre  pand then suddenly clang realized that there might be something fishy with codeacodep  precodetest.cpp714 warning variable a is uninitialized when used within its own initialization [Wuninitialized]              a0               codepre  pBut there was no problem with codeacode before... For some reasons clang cannot spot the tautology in this case. Again, it might simply be because those are not full statements anymore. p  pstrongThe problems arestrongp  ul liis this code valid and well defined in all versionsli lihow is the list of comma separated statements handled Should it be different from the first version of the code with explicit statementsli liis GCC right to report undefined behavior and sequence point issues in this case clang is missing some important diagnostics I am aware that it says strongmaystrong, but still...li liis clang right to report that codeacode might be uninitialized in the last case then it should have the same diagnostic for the previous caseli ul  pstrongEdit and commentsstrongp  ul liI am getting several rightful comments that this code is anything but simple. This is true, but the point is that the compilers misdiagnose when they encounter commaseparated statements in initializers. This is a bad thing. I made my code more complete to avoid the emhave you tried this syntax...em comments. A much more realistic and human readable version of the problem could be written, which would exhibit wrong diagnostics, but I think this version shows more information and is more complete.li liin a compilertorture test suite, this would be considered very understandable and readable, they do much much worse  We need code like that to test and assess compilers. This would not look pretty in production code, but that is not the point here.li ul

Negative 82352 pSo, I was trying to read a Trie, relatively a new data structure for me. And where ever I read, every node in the trie, would consist of an integer variable which would mark the end of an word, and would also consist of 26 pointers, each pointing to nodes in the lower levelassuming the words only contain small letter characters.p  pNow the problem I am facing is, where ever I seeread the implementation, they mark the node with a character.

However, in Java the gospel seems to be that the JVM deals efficiently with shortlived objects and that there is consequently nothing to be gained from patterns such as object pools.p  pI should add that the most performancehungry part of the application is the parser, which does indeed create a whole lot of shortlived objects as part of its operation.p  pWhat do you think the time spent in codeObject.ltinitgtcode is due to Is it indeed linked to memory allocation Could I benefit from using an object pool or some other trick to reduce memory allocationp  pEDITp  pIn reaction to Mike Dunlaveys answer, here is the interpretation of hprofs output by a hrefhttpjperfanal.sourceforge.netJPerfAnalmanual.html relnofollowJPerfAnala, giving inclusive times.p  precodeMethod Times by Caller times inclusive 3076 ticks   1 java.lang.Object.ltinitgt 71,26 2192 inclusive  2191 exclusive     2 com.sun.demo.jvmti.hprof.Tracker.ObjectInit 0,03 1 inclusive  0 exclusive       3 java.lang.Thread.currentThread 0,03 1 inclusive  1 exclusive   1 parser.ParseData.ltinitgt 34,33 1056 inclusive  0 exclusive     2 parser.ParseErrors.ltinitgt 13,98 430 inclusive  1 exclusive       3 java.lang.Object.ltinitgt 7,18 221 inclusive  221 exclusive       3 java.util.ArrayList.ltinitgt 6,76 208 inclusive  208 exclusive     2 java.lang.Object.ltinitgt 13,52 416 inclusive  416 exclusive     2 java.util.ArrayList.ltinitgt 6,83 210 inclusive  0 exclusive       3 java.util.ArrayList.ltinitgt 6,83 210 inclusive  210 exclusive   1 parser.Matcher.parse 34,33 1056 inclusive  0 exclusive     2 parser.ParseData.ltinitgt 34,33 1056 inclusive  0 exclusive       3 parser.ParseErrors.ltinitgt 13,98 430 inclusive  1 exclusive         4 java.lang.Object.ltinitgt 7,18 221 inclusive  221 exclusive         4 java.util.ArrayList.ltinitgt 6,76 208 inclusive  208 exclusive       3 java.lang.Object.ltinitgt 13,52 416 inclusive  416 exclusive       3 java.util.ArrayList.ltinitgt 6,83 210 inclusive  0 exclusive         4 java.util.ArrayList.ltinitgt 6,83 210 inclusive  210 exclusive   1 java.util.ArrayList.ltinitgt 28,38 873 inclusive  419 exclusive     2 java.util.AbstractList.ltinitgt 14,76 454 inclusive  0 exclusive       3 java.util.AbstractCollection.ltinitgt 14,76 454 inclusive  0 exclusive         4 java.lang.Object.ltinitgt 14,76 454 inclusive  454 exclusive codepre  pJPerfAnal also generates an inverted tree where the childs are the callers of the parents.

Negative 82352 pIm new to c though I have basic knowledge of Java, Im trying to make a program that converts roman numeral input and then finds the equivalent arabic number and outputs it. However I am having an issue of finding the specific prefixes in the roman numerals Im trying to use the str.find function and then using str.substr to test to see if the prefix exists and if so it gives the arabic value, and then will continue onto the next prefix.

would be greatly appreciated thanks.p  pEDIT So I took the advice and it all seems to be working alright Code has been edited, so thanks alot for that.  p  pHowever, since it is checking for X separately and deleting it my program is translating the input IX as 11 when it is actually 9. I know this has to do with the order that my program finds the prefixes in the strings, however Im not sure on how to fix it, so any help on that would be great. p  pThanks againp

This seems to be same technique that Twitter is using for their homepage when you visit it signed out. This technique has gotten the image size down to about 180 KB which is acceptable to me.  Its the same size as Twitters.  p  pHowever, I want to be able to provide even higher resolution versions of the image for high res screens such as my Macbook Pro Retina and iPad.  I know I can do this with media queries but if the resolution goes up so does the size. Are there any compression technologies that would allow me to apply more or less compression to specific sections of an image In this image, it would be idea to apply more compression to the out of focus sections behind the grill while leaving the asparagus and grill itself less compressed. Since the out of focus area is a large part of the image this should save a lot of space.p

Negative 82352 pI have an .NET Web MVC4 application that is being developed by 2 people me and another person.p  pWe are currently developing new controllers and views, each one with its scope.p  pWe are both using VS2012 and TFS on Microsofts cloud www.visualstudio.com.p  pOur problem is every time one of us create new controllerviewmodelview on one side, even if we check it in, the newly created files are not downloaded at the others project, either by using Get Latest or Get Specific Version. Remembering that a new controller is a class file and a new view is a folder with some .CSHTML files.p  pEven deleting the whole project and creating a new one from TFS the files are not added to project. In that case, the files are downloaded to their correct location on disk but not added to the Solution Explorer project.p  pSo its being painfull to keep both of us with the same file.p  pHope someone can help us to solve that.p

Negative 82352 pUser enters a query and I need to get webpage relevant to that query, once webpage is retrieved then I need to get important image from that webpage. p  pOne approach might be to get the image defined in codeOpen Graph Protocolcode image tag, the way facebook does it, but the problem is that not many websites are conforming to OGP at the moment and thus most of the times no image is returned.p  pThe second approach might be to assign score to every image base on its size, aspect ratio e.t.c as discussed in one of questions at SObut at the moment I cant follow that approach due to some constraints.p  pThe third approach that I was thinking is to see if the caption of the image contains any words from query, if it does then I can get that image. Not many image contains captions, but atleast I can get ones which have caption.p  pThe problem I am facing is that how to determine whether image has a caption or not At the moment I am gettimg image element via BeautifulSoup library, and then I examine the next element. if next element contains text and if text contains words from query I get the image. But a lot of captions gets missed and many times noncaption text is retrieved.p  pDo you have a better idea on how to tackle the problem Any help is highly appreciated.p

Negative 82352 pI declared one variable inside for loop and compiled the class. In next class I did the same but this time I just declared variable outside loop. In both cases byte code generated was same but when jvm executed code for both performance readings were different.p  pMy Question is p  ol lipDoes Same byte code means same source code  I think no because I had different code each timepli lipHow does same JVM gives different performance measurements for same bytecode. I have captured data for each bytecode several times hence I am asking this question. Same JVM is also used and there were no other applications running on systempli ol  pThere are so many links available for variable declaration inside and outside loop in java.p  pI am really waiting for a strongest answer p
Negative 82352 pAccording to webpagetest.org, my 2 pages have very different latency, so it seems that on one page memcache speeds it up or what is otherwise the reason for that page 2 is so slow when Iv tried to use memcache and even turned off images and turned off javascript and page 2 is still slow Why is the time to first byte so slow at the list page when I use memcachep  pimg

IA32e mode has two submodes.p blockquote  pThis two submodes is codeCompatibility modecode and code64bit modecode. Thus codeIntel 64code architecture contains 4 operating modes protected mode, realaddress mode, system management mode, IA32e mode. But I dont understand for what protected mode is needed in codeIntel 64code Compatibility submode of IA32e permit to run legacy 16 and 32bits application without recompilation to 64bit OS and 64bit submode permits OS to run application which access to 64bit linear address space.

However, the data gets presented in codeltdivgtcodes that are inside the codeltdivgtcode that knows the array index and the event doesnt hook with him for some reason.p  pWhen you run it, you see that the log only lists the contact whenever the green middle codeltdivgtcode gets clicked but strongnotstrong the red information codeltdivgtcodes.

Negative 82352 pI want a scroll bar appear in a stack panel when there are too many items to fit in a screen, just like ListBox does. I cant just put it into a scroll viewer, because in that case horizontal StackPanel stops to scale elements verticaly. ScrollViewer tells its content, that it has infinite place to fit in, and items always keep their original size and ScrollViewer just crops elements and shows vertical scrollbar if height is too small or leaves blank space if it is too big.

Negative 82352 pI am wondering if anyone is aware of a way to simulate a ball for example moving in 3D in SpriteKit a 2D framework. Like if a soccer ball is rolling, or a stripped pool ball, or even a baseball with the red stiches. I think 2D treatment of this sort of thing makes it look like it moves around on a sheet of ice instead of a realistic rolling behavior. That works for objects like a hockey puck, but not for a realistic roll of a ball. Any thoughts on doing this would be great. I have played games that get this to work and the devs claim to be using a 2d engine. The most recent that I can remember is Miniclips Pool game. They claim to have used Cocos and it is a 2D game if I recall correctly from an article I read.p

Negative 82352 pI understand the role of the bias node in neural nets, and why it is important for shifting the activation function in small networks. My question is this is the bias still important in very large networks more specifically, a convolutional neural network for image recognition using the ReLu activation function, 3 convolutional layers, 2 hidden layers,  and over 100,000 connections, or does its affect get lost by the sheer number of activations occurringp  pThe reason I ask is because in the past I have built networks in which I have forgotten to implement a bias node, however upon adding one have seen a negligible difference in performance. Could this have been down to chance, in that the specifit dataset did not require a bias Do I need to initialise the bias with a larger value in large networks Any other advice would be much appreciated.p

Negative 82352 pIs there a way to hyperlink the items of an a hrefhttpvitalets.github.ioxeditabledemobs3.html relnofollowxeditablea list p  pIn the example link, Id like to have html and javascript hyperlinked in the Select2 tags mode row. The hyperlink structure would follow the content of the tags e.g. hreftagshtml for the html tag. The idea being that when the user isnt in edit mode, he could click on the tag to see other items with the same tag.p  pIf this isnt easily achieved, suggestions for hyperlinking the Checklist row in the same example, or another library all together, would be appreciated.p

Negative 82352 pI have a program that creates logs and these logs are used to calculate balances, trends, etc for each individual client. Currently, I store everything in separate MYSQL tables. I link all the logs to a specific client by joining the two tables. When I access a client, it pulls all the logs from the logtable and generates a report. The report varies depending on what filters are in place, mostly date and category specific.p  pMy concern is the performance of my program as we accumulate more logs and clients. My intuition tells me to store the log information in the usertable in the form of a serialized array so only one query is used for the entire session. I can then take that log array and filter it using PHP where as before, it was filtered in a MYSQL query using multiple methods, such as BETWEEN for dates and other comparisons. p  pMy question is, do you think performance would be improved if I used serialized arrays to store the logs as opposed to using a MYSQL table to store each individual log We are estimating about 5001000 logs per client, with around 50000 clients and growing.p

In code it goeslike thisp  precode def textparserstring, command     stringlist  []     commandlist  []      for x in string         stringlist.appendx      for x in command         commandlist.appendx      if lenstringlist  0      checks to see if user have entered anything         return False      if stringlist gt commandlist  stringlist lt commandlist is 1     returns false if string has more items than command         return False      else         if stringlist[lenstringlist]  commandlist[lenstringlist]             return True         else             return False codepre  pAnd you can call this function byp  precodeif textparserhel, hello is True     printThis returns True  if textparserhel, Foo is True     printThis returns False codepre  pNow this code works perfectly.. exactly what I need for it to do. If I type in se and its other endmembers for the command search it will always be true... but now comes my biggest problem.. Say i have two commandsp  pquit and quaff and the user only inputs qup  pAccording to my algorithm it will execute both the quit and the quaff, because my code is set up asp  precodeif text parser check     blah if text parser check     blach etc....    The only way out of this is to do nested ifs and elifs.. which will look messy.. codepre  pWhich is not what I want to do at all. As you can see many more problems can arise the more commands you set up with the game. p  pWhat will be a good algorithm set up for text parsing Or do I just need to change a few things in my already existing code to address the bugs that can pop up with this set up... Thanksp

Negative 82352 pI am attempting to publish and consume versioned NuGet packages of class libraries while avoiding headaches for local development. Here is a sample Visual Studio solution layoutp  precode Libraries    LibraryA    LibraryB    LibraryC  Applications    ApplicationD    ApplicationE codepre  pThis is a single solution containing both shared class libraries and multiple applications. Currently references to the class libraries by the applications are local insolution references.p  pWhat I would like to do is to publish the libraries A,B,C as versioned NuGet packages which are then referenced by the applications as needed D,E. This allows a change to a shared library to be independent from an update to an application which is deployed. Without this, changing one library could cause the binaries to change in a dozen or more applications, all of which would technically need to be tested. This is undesirable, and versioning with NuGet fixes this.p  pHowever, let us say that I want to update the content of LibraryA and ApplicationD at the same time. In order to do this after we have switched to NuGet, I will have to make changes to LibraryA, commit them, wait for the package to be created, tell ApplicationD to update its reference to LibraryA, and then test or develop in ApplicationD. This is far more complicated than simply working with both at the same time using local insolution references.p  pWhat is a better way to get both the robustness of versioned NuGet packages for my shared class libraries while also keeping development simple even if it spans over multiple projects and applications The only other solutions I have found all involve too much overhead or headache, such as having to constantly change the references for ApplicationD between the NuGet package and the local project.p  pstrongEDITstrong To clarify the premise, this question assumes the followingp  ul liThe architecture solution and project organization cannot be significantly reorganizedli liShared libraries are going to change at a nontrivial frequencyli liChanging a shared library cannot force any application to be updatedli liApplications can reference different versions of shared librariesli ul

Negative 82352 pI have written an excel addin that queries an external csv file.

My question concerns linking the addin with the appropriate filepath of the .csv, which may change from time to time.p  pIm trying to avoid having to manually enter a filepath upon installation of the .csv, to allow for flexibility to change the path later without reinstalling.  My initial thinking is to have a button on the ribbon that lets the user choose the filepath via browsing.  However, Im not sure how to make that filepath choice permanent so that it isnt lost upon closing and restarting Excel.  So, essentially, I want to have the user be able to save the filepath as a preference that endures, without needing to touch the developer tab, which many find to be overwhelming and scary.

Negative 82352 pi am trying to have apache in OSX to have override. With MAMP is properly working but with my apachectl dont work. So my .htaccess is proper. Ty for any help. Confs below. p  petcapache2httpd.confp  precode  This is the main Apache HTTP server configuration file.  It contains the  configuration directives that give the server its instructions.  See ltURLhttphttpd.apache.orgdocs2.4gt for detailed information.  In particular, see   ltURLhttphttpd.apache.orgdocs2.4moddirectives.htmlgt  for a discussion of each configuration directive.   Do NOT simply read the instructions in here without understanding  what they do.  Theyre here only as hints or reminders.  If you are unsure  consult the online docs. You have been warned.     Configuration and logfile names If the filenames you specify for many  of the servers control files begin with  or drive for Win32, the  server will use that explicit path.  If the filenames do not begin  with , the value of ServerRoot is prepended  so logsaccesslog  with ServerRoot set to usrlocalapache2 will be interpreted by the  server as usrlocalapache2logsaccesslog, whereas logsaccesslog   will be interpreted as logsaccesslog.    ServerRoot The top of the directory tree under which the servers  configuration, error, and log files are kept.   Do not add a slash at the end of the directory path.  If you point  ServerRoot at a nonlocal disk, be sure to specify a local disk on the  Mutex directive, if filebased mutexes are used.  If you wish to share the  same ServerRoot for multiple httpd daemons, you will need to change at  least PidFile.  ServerRoot usr    Mutex Allows you to set the mutex mechanism and mutex file directory  for individual mutexes, or change the global defaults   Uncomment and change the directory if mutexes are filebased and the default  mutex file directory is not on a local disk or is not appropriate for some  other reason.   Mutex defaultprivatevarrun    Listen Allows you to bind Apache to specific IP addresses andor  ports, instead of the default. See also the ltVirtualHostgt  directive.   Change this to Listen on specific IP addresses as shown below to   prevent Apache from glomming onto all bound IP addresses.  Listen 12.34.56.7880 Listen 80    Dynamic Shared Object DSO Support   To be able to use the functionality of a module which was built as a DSO you  have to place corresponding LoadModule lines at this location so the  directives contained in it are actually available before they are used.

User www Group www  ltIfModulegt   Main server configuration   The directives in this section set up the values used by the main  server, which responds to any requests that arent handled by a  ltVirtualHostgt definition.  These values also provide defaults for  any ltVirtualHostgt containers you may define later in the file.   All of these directives may appear inside ltVirtualHostgt containers,  in which case these default settings will be overridden for the  virtual host being defined.     ServerAdmin Your address, where problems with the server should be  emailed.  This address appears on some servergenerated pages, such  as error documents.  e.g. adminyourdomain.com  ServerAdmin youexample.com    ServerName gives the name and port that the server uses to identify itself.  This can often be determined automatically, but we recommend you specify  it explicitly to prevent problems during startup.   If your host doesnt have a registered DNS name, enter its IP address here.  ServerName www.example.com80    Deny access to the entirety of your servers filesystem.

You will also likely      need to provide a ltDirectorygt section to allow access to      the filesystem path.            ScriptAlias This controls which directories contain server scripts.       ScriptAliases are essentially the same as Aliases, except that      documents in the target directory are treated as applications and      run by the server when requested rather than as documents sent to the      client.

Negative 82352 pTheres quite a good amount of code in this project.  At the moment, Im not getting a callback to add the remote stream to my codeRTCPeerConnectioncode.  Instead of providing a code sample at this point, Id rather just verify that Im taking a valid approach to setting up the connection.p  ol liA node.js backend server manages websocket connections to facilitate peer discovery. The server is working just fine.li liWhen a client requests the peer page, it sets up the connection during the onload handler.li liDuring onload, the client opens a websocket to the server, the server remembers the client by IPPORT string.li liThe client calls codegetUserMediacode and during the success callback, the codeRTCPeerConnectioncode is created, and codecreateOffercode.  During the callback, the localDescription set, which is what kicks off finding ICE candidates.li liWhen all ICE candidates have been gathered, the client registers with the server, sending its local description, ICE candidates, etc. to the server.li liThe server notifies any other connected clients that a new per has joined, sending the sdp object and all ICE candidates as well.  This makes each client aware of the ICE candidates and SDP object for all other clients.li liAll peers react by creating a UI element for a user to click to initiate a call.li liWhen the user clicks the UI element, the associated remote peers information is looked up and each one of the remote peers ICE candidates are added to the peer connection, SDP object is added as the remote description, and the an invite request is sent to the server.li liThe server notifies the associated client that is being invited.li liThe peer that receives the notification then looks up the peer that is initiating the call and adds all of that peers ICE candidates and remote description.  It then calls codecreateAnswercode.li ol  pAt this point, my expectation is that the WebRTC stack would start the underlying session initiation and both peers would get the addstream callback to hook up the video.  Is this a good approach  Is it necessary for the workflow to happen in a different orderp  pThe WebRTCinternals log thanks Philipp Hancke shows the following.

So where is the bottleneck and how to improve itp  pan examplep  precode  data lt lista  data.frametime  1180, alpha.upper  sample1180,                beta.middle  sample1180, gamma.lower  sample1180,                 b  data.frametime1180, alpha.upper  sample1180,                 beta.middle  sample1180, gamma.lower  sample1180  gt data a     time alpha.upper beta.middle gamma.lower  1      1         133         179          99  2      2         175         147          56  3      3         169           9          24  4      4         116         129          75  5      5          92          65          65  6      6         141          73          49 b     time alpha.upper beta.middle gamma.lower 1      1         111           2          89 2      2          84          81         159 3      3          93          82          84 4      4          44          58         125 5      5          31          33         131 6      6           1         120          63 codepre  pmy code isp  precodegt data2ltlapplydata, functionx                 xltgatherx,stn,value,time                xltarrangex,time                xltddplyx,ctime,stn,value, functionx                   if grepl.upper,xstn  TRUE                                      xdepthlt1                    returnx                                    if grepl.lower,xstn  TRUE                                      xdepthlt3                    returnx                                    if grepl.middle,xstn  TRUE                                      xdepthlt2                    returnx                                                  returnx               codepre  pthe result should bep  precodegt data2 a     time         stn value depth 1      1 alpha.upper   111     1 2      1 beta.middle     2     2 3      1 gamma.lower    89     3 4      2 alpha.upper    84     1 5      2 beta.middle    81     2 6      2 gamma.lower   159     3 b 1      1 alpha.upper    38     1 2      1 beta.middle   151     2 3      1 gamma.lower    93     3 4      2 alpha.upper    61     1 5      2 beta.middle    56     2 6      2 gamma.lower    66     3   codepre

Negative 82352 pI need to solve the knapsack problem recursively, memoized and with dynamic programming. Currently Im stuck at the recursive method. p  pThe issue is that Im not actually sure whether my code is doing what its supposed to and Im not sure how to check, either. I adapted the code from what I found elsewhere on the internet.p  pThe problem involves profit and mass. Each item has a profit and mass associated, there is a MAXN umber of items available and a MAXCAPACITY for mass. The aim is to have as much profit in the knapsack as possible.p  pHere is the complete codep  precodeinclude ltstdio.hgt include ltstdlib.hgt  define MAXx, y x gt y  x  y define MINx, y x lt y  x  y  define MAXN 10 define MAXCAPACITY 165  int m[MAXN][MAXCAPACITY]  int knapsackRecursiveint capacity, int mass[], int profit[], int n      if n lt 0         return 0     if profit[n] gt capacity         return knapsackRecursivecapacity, mass, profit, n1     else         return MAXknapsackRecursivecapacity, mass, profit, n1, knapsackRecursivecapacity  mass[n], mass, profit, n1  profit[n]   int knapsackMemoizedint capacity, int mass[], int profit[], int n     int knapsackDynamicint capacity, int mass[], int profit[], int n     void test       int M1[4]  6, 3, 2, 4     int P1[4]  50, 60, 40, 20      int M2[10]  23, 31, 29, 44, 53, 38, 63, 85, 89, 82     int P2[10]  92, 57, 49, 68, 60, 43, 67, 84, 87, 72       a     knapsackRecursiveMAXCAPACITY, M1, P1, MAXN     knapsackRecursiveMAXCAPACITY, M2, P2, MAXN       b     knapsackMemoizedMAXCAPACITY, M1, P1, MAXN     knapsackMemoizedMAXCAPACITY, M2, P2, MAXN       c     knapsackDynamicMAXCAPACITY, M1, P1, MAXN     knapsackDynamicMAXCAPACITY, M2, P2, MAXN    int main      test  codepre  pAs I have mentioned, Im not actually sure how I would check whether the calculation is correct in the first place as in, where to insert debug codeprintfcodes. I tried printing the end result of M1  P1 and that resulted in 170 which I dont think is correct.p  pEDIT Here is an example provided by the exercisep  blockquote   pExample Given a knapsack of capacity 5, and items with mass[]  2, 4, 3, 2   and profit profit[]  45, 40, 25, 15, the best combination would be item 0 with mass 2 and profit 45 and item 2 with mass 3 and with profit 25 for a total profit of 70.

Negative 82352 pI currently have some images with color varying in a somewhat smooth way, i.e. regions blending into each other.  Think Tie Dye maybe.  I would like to average the image by averaging each pixcel with adjacent ones, using an input N for  N pixcels in X and Y. Ideally, it should go to a solid color as N increases, but for smaller N simply blur regions.   I have read up on LABspace in order to do this rather than RGB, as well as the trick of averaging quadratically i.e. adding squares and then taking the square root for each RGB or LAB channel.  This code I have written however only works for the N0 case in returning the original image, however any value N1 returns a solid color.  I would expect that local variations would take a while until getting my solid image.

Negative 82352 pClass apache HttpClient was declared deprecated with Android SDK 22 v 5.1, but it is not present in Android 23 v 6.0p  pThe trouble is that all advertising SDKs, I know, apart from recent release of AdMob SDK as a part of GMS use HttpClient class and therefore as far as I can see it will crash with Android 6.0 unless maybe in compatibility mode, which I want to avoid in order to use new 6.0 features.p  pSDKs, like MobFox and MoPub are open source, so they could be modified for Android SDK 23 by replacing HttpClient with URL.openConnection this is what I actually did with MobFox, but unfortunately majority of SDKs are not like that.p  pThe issue can be addressed to SDK developers, but on my experience it will take ages to wait for the new release.p  pSurprisingly enough no one posted this issue before, so I assume there should be a solution.

Negative 82352 pIm not sure if what Im trying to do is flawed or whether Im missing a vital step in Visual SVN somewhere but Im getting bogged down with this and would appreciate some helpp  pSay I have two existing solutions in my subversion repository Sol1 amp Sol2.p  pBoth Sol1 amp Sol2 currently contain a webProject, a dataProject and a servicesProject.  These projects are unique to each solution and contain entirely separate code.p  pNow lets say that Sol2 also has a modelsProject which contains model classes for interaction with a 3rd party database we use.  I am now modifying Sol1 and it also requires access to that 3rd party database.p  pFairly obviously to me at least I dont want to create a completely separate copyversion of the modelsProject to use in Sol1, I simply want to usereference the existing modelsProject as exists in Sol2 because it will be exactly the same code in either solution.  However when I try and add existing project to Sol1 in Visual Studio, it quite correctly, of course tells me that it wont be adding the modelsProject to the Visual svn for Sol1 as it is outside the working copy root.p  pAm I missing a fundamental logic problem here In this kind of scenario where the modelsProject exists in its own right and just happens to be contained within Sol2 at the moment an incorrect solution and I should instead have modelsProject as a standalone visual svn solution which creates a dll and then reference that dll from both Sol1 amp Sol2p  pThinking about it I can see that svn would have an issue tracking changes if they were being made from either Sol1 OR Sol2 on the same set of code in modelsProject so maybe the standalone modelsProject as a dll referenced in Sol1 amp Sol2 is the logically correct way forward...p

As you can see, all the rows have the codelinkidcode in common. That is the column which separates the category groups.

This is the way Ive tried, but it doesnt update any rows.p  precodeUPDATE categoryrelationships SET parentid  SELECT categoryid FROM       SELECT linkid, categoryid, sortorder    FROM categoryrelationships    AS t1  WHERE t1.linkid  categoryrelationships.linkid AND t1.sortorder  1  WHERE sortorder  2 codepre  pThis approach wont do them all at once, but thats ok, I can just populate them one level at a time.p

Negative 82352 pAs part of a benchmarking task, I was investigating the different mechanisms that can be used to measure elapsed time. Ive finalised on using codeclockgettimecode, but I did do sufficient research and testing with the codeRDTSCcode instruction as well. I have several question regarding the same based on what I read on several online threadsp  ul lipOn newer processors Pentium 4, the TSC ticks at the maximum frequency of the CPU on the system. Is this correct In that case is it valid to use the number of ticks and frequency to determine the timepli lipIf the above is true, it means TSC is unaffected by changes in CPU frequency due to power saving and other features. Knowing this, would it mean the total ticks obtained by using codeRDTSCcode are NOT the actual ticks used by the sampled piece of code  since the code would run at the frequency of the CPU and not that of the TSC In addition, does this mean the time obtained by using the TSC ticks and CPU frequency isnt the actual time used by the code piecepli lipIm finding lots of different statements about the synchronizing of the TSC value across cores see a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions3388134rdtscaccuracyacrosscpucores titlethis threadthis threada. Im not sure what is correct and Im guessing it depends on the processor model as well. But can it be assumed to be synchronized among cores on newer CPUs This is without using codeschedsetaffinitycodepli ul  pDo note that Im not using codeRDTSCcode due to the various problems associated with it portability, reliability etc. These questions are just to improve my understanding of how TSC works and of benchmarking in general.p
