Positive 902 pI have a single page app that has a dojo dgrid grid and a map.  All the elements on the map appear in the dgrid grid.  When a user clicks on an item on the map, I would like to programmatically jumpscroll to the element in the dgrid grid.  I havent come across any documentation that explains how to do this.  Is this possiblep  pThanks in advancep

Positive 902 pI am trying to understand why the opening tab gets focused automatically. It is created programmatically. And vendordojo files we do not change as they are part of build so any idea on how I can correct or override this behaviour Is this a normal behaviour There is a tool tip attached to the label of the tab, so it fires up also when it is focused which is not ideal as the tooltip can be massive since it is dynamically filled.

Negative 902 pWe attempt to do agile development at my current job and we succeed for the most part. The main problem seems to be that the developers on the project are always waiting for requirements at the beginning of the sprint and rushing to get get things down by the end. The business analysts who are delivering the requirements are always working nonstop to get the requirements done.p  pstrongEDIT Additional Informationstrong We are customizing a COTS application for our internal use. Our user stories just consist of what part of the application we will be customizing in the specific sprint and also what systems we will integrate with internally. The integration with different systems normally works pretty well because we can start working on that right away. The customize x screen are the main problems areas because the developers cant do anything from that. We have to wait until we get the requirements from the BAs before we can really do anything.p  pstrongEDIT More insightconfusion perhapsstrong I wonder if part of the problem is that the screen that are being customized are already there as this is a COTS product that is being heavily customized. People suggest that the user stories should be along the lines of make a screen that does X. Thats already done. Maybe there isnt a good way to do user stories for these requirements... maybe this need to be a whole new question.p

Negative 902 pThe reason I am asking this is that I had accidentally done a codegit commit acode that included a file I did not yet want to commit. My solution was to do the followingp  precodegit reset soft HEAD git reset  filewithchangesnottocommitted git commit C HEAD1 codepre  pHere, Ive rewound the branch by one commit while keeping the index and working tree, then pulled codefilewithchangesnottocommittedcode from a yet older revision into the index, and then I committed the index using the commit message from the previous branch head commit. Neither codegitresetcode invocation touches the working copy, so my modifications to codefilewithchangesnottocommittedcode persist, but are no longer recorded in the codeHEADcode revision.p  pHowever, it would have been easier if I could pull codefilewithchangesnottocommittedcode from the codeHEADcode revision right into the index emwithout touching the working copyem. Since the index otherwise already represents the state I want, I could then just amend the codeHEADcode commit, producing a sequence like thisp  precodegit magicpony HEAD filewithchangesnottocommitted git commit amend C HEAD codepre  pThis is emalmostem what I would get by replacing codegitmagicponycode with codegitcheckoutcode, except for the requirement that the working copy be left untouched and only the index updated. It seems there is no way to make codegitcheckoutcode not touch both.p  pMy question is does codegitmagicponycode exist, and if so, under what namep

Negative 902 pMy Web host has refused to help me with this, so Im coming to the wise folks here for some help blackbox debugging. Heres an edited version of what I sent to themp  pI have two among other domains at dreamhostp  p1 thefigtrees.net   2 shouldivoteformccain.comp  pI noticed today that when I host a CGI script on 1, that by the time the CGI script runs, the HTTP GET query string passed to it as the QUERYSTRING environment variable has already been URL decoded. This is a problem because it then means that a standard CGI library such as perls CGI.pm will try to split on ampersands and then decode the string itself. There are two potential problems with thisp  p1 the string is doublydecoded, so if a value is submitted to the script such as 2525, it will end up being treated as just  decoded twice rather than 25 decoded oncep  p2 more common if there is an ampersand in a value submitted, then it will get properly submitted as 26, but the QUERYSTRING env. variable will have it already decoded into an amp and then the CGI library will improperly split the query string at that ampersand. This is a big problemp  pThe script at a hrefhttpthefigtrees.nettest.cgi relnofollowhttpthefigtrees.nettest.cgia demonstrates this. It echoes back the environment variables it is called with. Navigating in a browser top  pa hrefhttpthefigtrees.netleetest.cgixy26z relnofollowhttpthefigtrees.netleetest.cgixy26zap  pYou can see that REQUESTURI properly contains xy26z unencoded but that QUERYSTRING already has it decoded to xyampz. If I repeat the test at domain 2  a hrefhttpwww.shouldivoteformccain.comtest.cgixy26z relnofollowhttpwww.shouldivoteformccain.comtest.cgixy26za  I see that the QUERYSTRING remains undecoded, so that CGI.pm then splits and decodes correctly.p  pI tried disabling my .htaccess files on both to make sure that was not the problem, and saw no difference.p  pCould anyone speculate on potential causes of this, since my Web host seems unwilling to help mep  pthanks, Leep
Negative 902 pThis is my problem. I have a program that has to run in a TTY, cygwin provides this TTY. When I redirect stdIn the program fails because it does not have a TTY.

Negative 902 pI installed Resharper in VS2008 and it seems to have taken over some of the snippets Ive come to rely on. For instance, prop, foreach, etc...p  pHow can I tell Resharper to let VS2008 use its own snippets or at least not to overwrite snippets that already exist.br  Better yet, is there a way to selectively tell Resharper which snippets it can overwrite and which it shouldntp  pI know about the Live Templates menu item that lets you pick and choose, but after deselecting foreach, for example, VS or probably Resharper treats it as a function. In other words, when I type fore and hit tab for autocomplete, I end up with foreach instead of the snippet operation.  p  pThanksp
Negative 902 pI have an objectdatasource that will return a potentially large collection up to 200,000 records that are bound and paged in a gridview.  I am using default paging and caching on the objectdatasource.  The data being returned is only updated weekly so stale data is not an issue.   The paging in this solution was also faster than when I created a solution using custom paging.   p  pMy questions are  Is caching a record set this large acceptable to you  If not, why  Are there any performance counters that you use to see the impact on memory that your cached data is creatingp  pThanks p

Negative 902 pI have written presumably some of the first code to modify the memory of a popular new MMORPG in such a way as to create a macro framework, allowing for advanced automated reactions, skilllevel gain, large scale data retrieval, and botting.p  pIts my supreme pleasure to automate tasks in this way, I cant help but think of any manual approach as broken. In fact I find myself rather unable to complete even single player games before dissecting their mechanics and gaming them, in a specifically readonly not cheats, per se mouse and keyboard input only fashion. Supplementing my advancement toward a game related goal with my own programming knowledge seems natural, its really not emfunem otherwise, like ignoring your firearm in an FPS.p  pSince I love this form of reverse engineering I assume others do as well, theyd appreciate the end result at least. I tend to feel a project should somehow ship be sold, open sourced, or freely distributed. Happiness only real when shared. Otherwise its just me and my timesink.p  pThe strongproblemstrong is that there are several moral stances involved with a project of this naturep  ol lipAn evil is released upon the virtual world. Those with the program have an advantage, the game is unbalanced, youve got to use, simply to be on equal footing. Its no longer about the game, but the tools, an arms race. Its like every other MMORPG. Therefore, keep the code private.pli lipThe above is eminevitableem, so release a peremptory free distribution to give players equal access to the advantage and potentially deny someone else a more evil e.g. elitist, commercial, etc. release. Between evils the least is selected, though its necessity is disagreeable.pli lipSell the program, reap the benefit of your proclivity, its work for which you deserve recompensation, fair trade and regardless of ToS violations. Follow the likes of WoWGlider. Is it better in fewer handspli lipKeep the code private. Respect at least this much of the companys Terms of Service you agreed to.pli ol  pWhat is a morally defensible approach What havent I considered In my experience ToS agreements are a largely ineffective form of dissuasion, and the gaming of MMORPGs and subsequently results described in 1 is indeed inevitable, but theres something to be said in not pulling the trigger yourself  or is it not so badp  hr  pI did a poor job on the original phrasingtitling of this question, I was really looking to see if there were special circumstances when it emcould beem morally defensible, not whether or not it would emnormallyem be, in hope my code could have constructive purposes.p  pAs a new user I didnt realize 99 of the responses would be immediate, before my update. That said, I still received some very helpful answers regarding commercialization and the original question merited the answers provided, so well done on that front.p  pI emdoem have my answer despite the inevitability of bots, dont pull the trigger yourself Be the change, etc. 3 was never on the table for me personally, but elicited some brilliant answers.p

Upon returning, transaction ends and lock is gone a case with server managed JTA manager. So, no point, loosely speaking. There are valid cases, though.p  pAnother example is much more trivial. Suppose you fire a query to get some entity, that has a lazy loading onetomany association with some other entity. Upon returning the DAO method, transaction ends. Lazy loading wouldnt work anymore, you simply get codenullcode or something. To cope with that we load it eagerly manually. we do something like codea.getBList.sizecode.p  pThus, IMO its better to not make a DAO exclusively, and do it in your business bean, this way you will be able to take advantage of those useful features. Or ORM API can be considered a DAODatalayer itself, arguably. So, we dont need to make another.p  pWhat you folks think about itp  pstrongNote I dont say, by any means, that the DAO pattern is obsolete. Indeed it depends case to case.strongp

Negative 902 pIn my company we have developped some applications. We have to create an API for one application say application A, so that the others can use it an its data.p  pThe question is  we already have developped PHP classes for the model of Application A, if we want to create an API, should we br  reuse these classes too much functionnalities for an API, too heavy...br  create one PHP class, with some basic functions, that takes in input and returns only raw values like strings, array... NOT complex classesbr  create another set of PHP classes, simpler, and designed only to be used by an external application so only to get data easilyp  pUsually, an API is the 2nd solution to be used as well with PHP than as a web service for example, but i find it too bad that we made a complex and usefull class modelisation, then we tear it apart just to have functions, strings and array. The 3rd one seems to me to be the compromise, but a collegue of mine insist that this is not an API. Too bad...p  pWhat do you think p

Negative 902 pI am writing an application that writes to SQL Compact files that have a specific schema, and I am now implementing the New File use case. The simplest approach seems to be to use a Template pattern first, create a template file that lives in the application directory. Then, when the user selects New File, the template is copied to the name and destination specified by the user in a New File dialog.p  pThe alternative is a scripted approach Use the same New File dialog, but dispense with the template file. Instead, create an empty SQL Compact file using the namedestination specified by the user, and then execute a TSQL script on it from managed code.p  pAt this point, I am leaning toward the Template approach, because it is simpler. Is there any reason I should not use that approach Thanks for your help.p

Negative 902 pI recently switched from using Linq to Sql to the Entity Framework. One of the things that Ive been really struggling with is getting a general purpose IQueryable extension method that was built for Linq to Sql to work with the Entity Framework.  This extension method has a dependency on the Like method of SqlMethods, which is Linq to Sql specific.  What I really like about this extension method is that it allows me to dynamically construct a Sql Like statement on any object at runtime, by simply passing in a property name as string and a query clause also as string.  Such an extension method is very convenient for using grids like flexigrid or jqgrid.

Negative 902 pWe are working on using a 3rd partys ActiveX control within a web page.  Our page includes JavaScript to access and manipulate the control.  Part of the controls functionality requires it to access files on the local filesystem.p  pIf we generate the page programmatically, this functionality fails  the ActiveX control appears unable to access the filesystem.  If we take the generated page source, copy it into a static file, and serve that file from the same web server, everything works as expected  the ActiveX control gets the info it needs from the filesystem, and we go merrily on our way.p  pI have used a JavaScript debugger to walk through the two different pages, and verified that the calls to the ActiveX control have identical parameters.  I have verified that both the static page and the dynamic page are listed in the Local Intranet Zone in IE so they should have the same security constraints.p  pI have used SysInternals ProcessMonitor to see what the ActiveX control is doing in the system, and what differs.  Interestingly, when the calls to the control succeed, there are ProcessMonitor traces showing where the control is querying the registry for filenames, and accessing the filesystem.  When the process fails, its not the case that there are failures accessing the filesystem, but rather, the control never queries the registry to find the filename, and never tries to hit the filesystem.p  pThe vendor of this control is mystified, and Ive run out of ideas of what to try.  Is there something that I ought to be checking Some difference between dynamicallygenerated pages and static pages that IE or an ActiveX control might be able to detect, that would cause behaviors to change  The URI is different, the static page has a .html extension....  Theres not much else thats different, as far as I can tell.p  pAny ideas would be welcome....p

Negative 902 pI just worked out, by trialanderror, that IE 7 has an upper limit of 32 stylesheet includes i.e.  tags.p  pIm working on the frontend of a very large website, in which we wish to break our CSS into as many separate files as we wish, since this makes developing and debugging much easier.p  pPerformance isnt a concern, as we do compress all these files into a single package prior to deployment.p  pThe problem is on the development side. How can we work with more than 32 stylesheets if IE 7 has an upper limit of 32p  pIs there any means of hacking around thisp  pIm trying to come up with solutions, but it seems that even if I loaded the stylesheets via Ajax, Id still be writing out  tags, which would still count towards the 32stylesheet limit.p  pIs this the case Am I stuck with the 32file limit or is there a way around itp  pNOTE Im asking for a strongclientsidestrong solution to this. Obviousy a serverside solution isnt necessary as we already have a compression system in place. I just dont want to have to do a recompress every time I make one little CSS change that I want to test.p
Negative 902 pIm building a server that serves two clients using streamreaderswriters using networkstreams, using newline symbols to indicate the startend of a new command.  Because readline and writeline too, but thats not an issue, will block until there actually is a line to read, I use socket.select in order to determine when there is a line to read.  However, because I dont know how many lines there are to read, I just read one, and loop back using socket.select again.  Which, according to the documentation a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibrarysystem.net.sockets.socket.select.aspx relnofollowhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibrarysystem.net.sockets.socket.select.aspxa says that if its still readable, it will make the list to the readable sockets and continue, or if youve read everything, it wont.  Here is my codep  precodeDateTime startTime  DateTime.Now DateTime endTime  startTime.AddSecondsDouble.ParseplayTime ListltSocketgt clients double secondsLeft while secondsLeft  endTime  DateTime.Now.TotalSeconds gt 0      clientSockets  new ListltSocketgt  clientSocket1, clientSocket2      Socket.SelectclientSockets, null, null, intsecondsLeft  1000000     if clientSockets.ContainsclientSocket1              handlePlayerreader1, writer1, writer2          if clientSockets.ContainsclientSocket2              handlePlayerreader2, writer2, writer1       codepre  pHowever, in a unit test, when the clients send a lot of words in rapid succession, it will only read the first word from each player and then scoekts.select will freeze until the timout is reached.

This works great, my app now responds to any part of the screen and it doesnt look like a button is being pressed. So the first part of my question is this is this bad If so, whyp  p2 Well nearly any part of the screen responds. For some reason, the very bottom 5 or so of the display doesnt respond to the touch and Ive no idea why. The button is stretched down to the bottom and theres nothing else down there to intercept the touch. Any ideasp  pThanksp

Negative 902 pSo my most basic question here is stronghow do you build TCP interfaces into your Java EE applicationsstrong Instead of interacting with a legacy EIS, I need to interact with a block of TCPIP ports. Ideally, Id like a messagedriven bean to have its onMessage method invoked by an incoming TCP request and also be able to respond back over the same connection.p  pJCA seems general enough to be capable of something like this within a Java EE environment. Would developing a custom connector be the appropriate technique for integrating inboundoutbound TCP interfaces in a Java enterprise ecosystemp  hr  pAs far as what Ive tried so far were currently utilizing a lifecycle module which starts by kicking off a number of TCP listeners this invokes a messagedriven bean which calls a business method, and it all returns over the same TCP stream. This is actually working alright, but the lifecycle support in my application server Glassfish feels like it has been added as an afterthought. So, JCA seems like a firstclass solution to this sort of problem and it seems to enable us to communicate over TCP.p  pHowever, from the initial research weve conducted, it does seem like the connector architecture is targeted towards legacy information systems, not generalized TCP communication. So, my question could be rendered are people using custom JCAs to integrate TCPIP into their Java EE applications  or is there a better technique for accepting TCP connections from my EJBsp

Dont know if thats allowed or not.p  pAnyways, I wanted to know what your thoughts on it is, and if there could be anything that could be improved. I try to read up a lot on designing, but trying to design always have things that are a bit off from the things you read and you start to wonder if it is correct or not.p  pI presentp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comRrX1U.png altSpace Invaders Architecturep

Negative 902 pIm looking at the feasability of implementing a bidirectional text parsing framework to allow formatted text to be processed using a combination of common paradigms such as Markdown, BBCode, DocuWiki, and so on. Practically speaking this means that each implentation must be able to translate to and from a common format. That could be HTML, but more realistically an intermediate more easily parsable format like XML or YAML.p  pThis will probably utilize a tokenizer to break the document into its relevant components. Does this sound like the best approach and can you forsee any significant roadblocksp  pLastly, is anyone aware of an existing implementations or attempts.p  pNote that this is focused on PHP, but other solutions are welcome.p
Negative 902 pJonah pointed me to the following explanation he has provided a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions4591586questiononviewcontrollersview45917464591746Question on View Controllers viewap  pI currently have a emMainViewControllerem whose mainroot view contains an Add Record UIButton which is linked to the following method and is dependent on which empageem the user currently has open in a UIScrollViewp  precodepragma mark  pragma mark Add View Support   voidaddidsender   MyAddViewController controller  nil       Dynamically creating and allocating the Add View Controller if dataViewPageControl.currentPage  0      controller  [[MyAddViewController alloc] initWithAddType1]  else      controller  [[MyAddViewController alloc] initWithAddType0]   controller.delegate  self       Slide the new AddViewControllers view in from the right     CGPoint initialCenter  self.view.center controller.view.center  CGPointMakeinitialCenter.x  320, initialCenter.y [self.view addSubviewcontroller.view]  [UIView beginAnimationsanimation contextNULL] [UIView setAnimationDuration0.35] [UIView setAnimationDelegatecontroller] controller.view.center  CGPointMakeinitialCenter.x, initialCenter.y [UIView commitAnimations] codepre  pp  pMainViewController is the delegate for MyAddViewController which has a CANCELCLOSE button and when its close button is clicked the MyAddViewController is released through the close method in this MainViewController.p  pAs you can see, MyAddViewControllers view becomes a subview to the current root view Bad Bad Bad MyAddViewControllers view is as a FULL size view 320x416 but whose top half is transparent, so that MainViewControllers view can be seen below on the top half and the bottom half contains the AddViewControllers view and textfields etc....p  pBased on what Ive read from Jonah just now at the link at the very top this sort of design is BAD, BAD, BAD. Ive noticed when testing in strongInstrumentsstrong that MyAddViewController sometimes emlagsem when sliding in. Ill click the ADD button to fire this method and there is sometimes a 3  5 sec delay before the view slides in. Some sort of delay in all the memory management and cleanup p  pIm assuming I can fix this by making a single MyAddViewController property inside MainViewController which will then prevent me from allocating and deallocating on every button click. That should make things smoother My only worry is that this will cause a greater memory imprint at application load time. strongInstrumentsstrong seems to show a 516KB allocation every time I click ADD for the first time in my app. p  pAny recommendations though on design and how to improve this The reason I like having separate view controllers with nested views like this is because MyAddViewController has a stronglotstrong of logic with Core Data and such and MainViewController is pretty busy enough already as it is. Trying to keep things modular.p  pThanks in advancep

Negative 902 pI am working on an Android app and I need to make sure that the device has reached a certain point described with lat and lon. The only thing that I can think of is to have something like that p  precode    Location initLoc  theManager.getLastKnownLocationLocationManager.GPSPROVIDER     double lat  initLoc.getLatitude     double lon  initLoc.getLongitude     MyPoint firstPoint  getPoints.get0      double dist  CalcHelper.getDistance1lat, lat, firstPoint.getLat, firstPoint.getLon      whiledist gt 30          initLoc  theManager.getLastKnownLocationLocationManager.GPSPROVIDER         lat  initLoc.getLatitude         lon  initLoc.getLongitude         dist  CalcHelper.getDistance1lat, lon, firstPoint.getLat, firstPoint.getLon       codepre  pBut that causes the program to crash. I would be very appreciative if you could lead me to the right direction here.p  pLet me take the opportunity to ask a further question. As I said I am new to Android and GPS and having in mind there is little documentation and information on how to properly develop applications that work with GPS I am working in blind basically. So my question isp  pThis is how the onLocationChanged method looks likep  precode            public void onLocationChangedLocation location               double lat  location.getLatitude             double lon  location.getLongitude             MyPoint firstPoint  MainScreen.dataset.getPoints.get0              double dist  CalcHelper.getDistance1lat, firstPoint.getLat,lon, firstPoint.getLon              ifdist lt 10                  Context context  getApplicationContext                 CharSequence text  Start reached.

So, when I start the program I receive a reasonable estimate on the distance. The problem is, when I start moving, the distance does not seem to be updated, it gets updated but after moving 50meters, it says i have only moved 5 say. On the other hand, when I start the application and I am less than 10m away from the starting point, it detects it properly. So basically, while I am moving with the device, the onLocationChanged method does not seem to give me the correct location that I am now on. Can you tell me what I might be doing wrong  p

Negative 902 pI need an extremely tiny implementation of maybe a subset of Javascript. Code size and memory usage are extremely important speed isnt in the question, it can run as slow as it likes.

Any suggestionsp  pEDIT Both of the responses I have seem good, exceptp  pSpiderMonkey concentrates a lot on making it faster, I dont care if its fast at all. br  QuadWheel sounds good, except the activity on it, and code comments are few I will be porting this to another architecture if that helps.p  pSo, any other responses would be great.

Negative 902 pIm currently working on a graph library for C and now got stuck at a point where I get an assertion error in debug mode during runtime. I also had a look an some other question here on SO but none of the questions and answers lead me to a solution. After reading in some forums I have the impression that this error happens because iterators become invalid as soon as the vector content is changed. for example when using codeerasecode But as you can see in my code, Im not modifying the vector, just iterating.p  pThe error is in the line I marked with codeASSERTIONcode. The strange thing is that codeneighboritcode doesnt point to the first object in codevertexitgtneighborscode but to code0xfeeefeeecode. When debugging through the code I can clearly see that the neighborsvector contains at least one item.

Negative 902 pI have the following problem. Sounds are hidden from the public folder, cause there are only certain Users who should have access to the sound files. So I made a certain method, which acts like a sound url, but calculates first, whether the current user is allowed to access this file. p  pThe file gets sent by the senddata method. The problem is just, that I it works quite slow if it works even... The developer of the jplayer plugin, which I use to play the sound, told me that I should be able to accept byte range requests to make it work properly...p  pHow can I do this within a rails controller by sending the file with senddata or sendfilep  pThanks, Markusp

Negative 902 h2Contexth2  pI am working on a java based desktop application that makes classroom reservation for a highschool. Each reservation is kept in an object of class RoomBooking whose content is as follows simplifiedp  precodepublic class RoomBooking implements java.io.Serializable       private int id     private String roomName, userName     private Date bookDate     private int beginTime        represents the reservation begin time i.e. 8 means 08.00      private int endTime       represents the reservation end time i.e. 9 means 09.00      private int  roomId  Constructor and settersgetters follow the above code .....  codepre  pI retrieve the reservataions from the database and put them into an ArrayList object which keeps an instance list of class RoomBooking i.e. ArrayList. The order of the objects in the list is based on the reservation date in increasing order.p  h2Problem Definitionh2  pNow I try to create a swing based UI i.e. JFrame which shows a 5 by 7 grid view using JTable It should look like a tabular calendar just like google calendar. The columns of the Jtable should be like Monday, Tuesday....Sunday and the cells in the Jtable will keep the days of a specific month from 1 to 28, 30 or 31 depending on the month e.g. 28 for February. The purpose here is to color a cell for which a reservation is present and place some informative text in it e.g. reservation time interval like 08.00  09.00p  pConsidering that the data in the previously mentioned ArrayList is linear and ordered based on the reservation date, I need map each reservation to a specific cell in the so mentioned JTable. p  pFor this purpose, I tried to write a method that receives the date for a reservation and returns the corresponding row and column number of the related cell in the Jtable. This introduces several side problems. For example, if the first day of the month does not start on Monday, the above mentioned method should be able to shift rowcolumn indexes it will return accordingly.p  h2Questionh2  pi Do you know if there is a freely available java bean component that will provide a tabular calendar view whose columns are the days of the weeks and the cells are days of the month cells should be able to take additional data in text like 08.0009.00p  pI found some commercial solutions in my google search but I am interested in opensource solutionsproposals. I am under kinda pressure and a readytouse component would be highly appreciated.  p  pii Has anoyone faced an issue similar to the one described in problem definition If so, could you please provide me some guidelines on writing the so mentioned mapper method. p  pAny suggestionhelp would be highy apreciated. p  pThanks in advance.p  pBest Regards, Fardap

Negative 902 pIm running into the following design problemp  pIm using the Qt C library for an application.  In this library there are the model classes which all inherit from codeQAbstractItemModelcode like codeQAbstractTableModelcode, codeQStandardItemModelcode, etc..  I want to inherit from several of these classes but define my own interface they must each share.p  pThe way Im currently doing this is by defining an interface pure virtual class and having the inheriting classes inherit from this as well.  As an example, lets say I want a class to inherit from codeQAbstractTableModelcode to have a codedoSomethingcode functionp  precodeclass MyInterface  public     virtual void doSomething  0  class MyModel  public QAbstractTableModel, public MyInterface      ...  codepre  pHowever, I just want to pass objects around as a codeQAbstractItemModelcode.  To use the interface classes I have to cast them to codeMyInterfacecode objects and then call the functions, which leads to casts all over the place.  Further, if anyone else makes their own class inhheriting from codeQAbstractItemModelcode it seems like theres room for error if they do not inherit the interface as well.p  pIs there a better design I could be using to accomplish all thisp

Now Im trying to implement the ability to use the arrows on the keyboard to move the selected box, but A TImage does not get any focus, and B TImage does not have any key events because it cannot get focus. I guess I could cheat and switch on the forms KeyPreview property and catch them there, but theres many other controls on this form and Id need to make sure the user is intending to work with the image.

Negative 902 pSo Ive found myself needing to do a little bit of flash...p  pIm playing a song and syncing up some visual changes with that song.  The issue is that in order for the song to play when I preview my changes to the animation, I have to start playing my flash project from frame 0.p  pThis becomes a problem when I am trying to sync to things that occur later in the song.  For example, if Im trying to sync something at frame 300 then I have to replay the entire animation from frame 0 in order to hear the song at frame 300 and beyond.p  pIs there any way to get the song to play, starting from the correct position, regardless of where I start running my animation while developingp  pI could hack something up in action script to move the play head and play the song if it currently isnt being played but Id rather not go down that route as there must be a simple solution to this problem.p

I want to have the second command not block. According to the info page of systemp  precodeIf a program is started with this function, in order for it to continue running  in the background, the output of the program must be redirected to a file or  another output stream.

I tried p  precodecmdecho 1 gt tmpmyfifo gt devnull 2gtamp1 amp codepre  pBut to be honest that seems nonsensical. p  pstrongEDITstrong p  pMy ultimate goal is to write to a fifo that may never be read from, and time out the write after 5 seconds. So, if I can manage to get this command to not block the php executition, I can sleep 5 seconds and then cat tmpmyfifo  devnull 2amp1 to unblock the original write. p  pCan anyone think of a better way to have my write not hang indefinitely in neither the background nor the foregroundp

Negative 902 pIve been following the UnitTest.proj amp IntegrationTest.proj per component practice for a while now.  However, Im finding that as my solution grows things start getting messy with all the tests projects etc... Also, Im exploring some BDD tools so now I may have to add another project specs to hold my specifications.  What Im thinking about doing is to create one test project per component then have folders and namespaces for Unit  Integration  Specs.  The have my build server discriminate on which tests to run based on the namespace.  So my CI builds will run Unit. and the nightly build will run all of them.

We have a report generation feature that can take a bit of time to complete, lately on average around 3.5 minutes. The problem is that while the report is generating on the server, at about the 2 minute 10 second mark, IE will redirect to Internet Explorer cannot display the page. In FF, after the same amount of time, its a blank white page.p  pWhile troubleshooting, I came across IISs connection timeout property, which is 120 seconds by default. That seemed very close to 2 minutes 10 seconds, so I upped it to 5 minutes, but the browsers still redirected after 2 minutes 10 seconds. I then tried lowering the value to 10 seconds in IIS for the website just to see what would happen, but still the browser redirected after 2 minutes 10 seconds. The connection timeout property does not seem to be doing anything at all, from what I can tell. I tried restarting the website, restarting the app pool, and even restarting IIS, with no change in my results.p  pMy first question is what kind of result the user would see in their browser if IIS was actually enforcing the connection timeout. Would they see the Internet Explorer cannot display the page page, or something differentp  pI have also looked through my web.config for any values that might affect a timeout, but nothing stands out. Im beginning to worry that theres a browser limit thats been set by group policy in the registry, but I cant be sure because the registry is locked down on end user machines.p  pDoes anyone have any idea why IIS would not be enforcing that timeout limit Am I looking in the wrong place, or is there another timeout value that could be causing this behavior, perhaps outside IIS completely Any help would be much appreciated.p

Negative 902 pIve read and studied about Interrupt Handling.br What I always fail to understand, is how do we know where to return to PC  IP from the Interrupt Handler.br As I understand it   p  ol liAn Interrupt is caused by a device say the keyboardli liThe relevant handler is called  under the running process. That is, no context switch to the OS is performed.    li liThe Interrupt Handler finishes, and passes control back to the running application.li ol  pThe process depicted above, which is my understanding of Interrupt Handling, takes place within the current running process context. So its akin to a method call, rather than to a context switch.br However, being that we didnt actually make the CALL to the Interrupt Handler, we didnt have a chance to push the current IP to the stack.br So how do we know where to jump back from an Interrupt. Im confused.   p  pWould appreciate any explanation, including oneliners that simply point to a good pdfppt addressing this question specifically.br [Im generally referring to above process under Linux and C code  but all good answers are welcomed]p

Negative 902 pUntil recently, our game checked collisions by getting the colour data from a section of the background texture of the scene.

This is compounded by us needing to run the same function twice once for each player and not being able to keep the same data they may not be on the same tile.p  pWeve tried moving the GetData calls to the tiles Draw function and storing the data in a member array, but this does not seem to have solved the problem As we are still calling GetData on a tile quite regularly  down from twice every update to once every draw.p  pAny help which you could give us would be great as the power that this collision system affords us is quite fantastic, but the overhead which render targets have introduced will make it impossible to keep. p

So  if i am clicking on a left menu link, a connection is established between client and  server using codeclient IP and Portcode to codeserver Ip and portcode. But before the response comes,  suppose i clicked on other link of menu then how server knows that old conneciton is  terminated and new connection is established.next thing,when i clicked on a link, request  goes to server, server process the request but before sending the response if connection  is terminated from client side, what happens to that response, does server discards the  response and takes the new request for process. p  pactually i have lot of confusion, so if anyone can explain me the full clientserver round trip process,that will really very helpful . p  pThanks in advancep

Negative 902 pIm trying to upgrade an old Wordpress plugin that lists a users latest commits on their website. It was very straightforward with github API v2, but v3 is making it a whole lot more complex. p  pFeaturewise, its very simple when the plugin is running, it lists the commits on the Wordpress site, and automatically refreshes its content every N minutes configurable by the Wordpress admin. The administrator just needs to set it up once and it figures out when to requery github to get the latest data. p  pBut with github API v3 any request to get even public data requires the OAUTH token. After reading over their docs again and again, it appears that it cant be automated to work the way I want. p  pFirst, I dont want to store the users github password anywhere because it would need to be encrypted twoway to be used in the API calls, which isnt safe enough, so the basic authentication method is out. Which leaves the  Web Application Flow example here httpdeveloper.github.comv3oauth. But that involved redirecting the actual user to github to accept the request. This is no good either.p  pAm I misunderstanding anything, or is it simply not possible to recreate the plugin to work as it currently doesp  pPlease let me know if Im not clear on anythingp

Negative 902 pWe have a requirement where only filesartifacts which have been peer reviewed manually should be released to production. How to do this in TortoiseSVNserver p  pThe solutions I am thinking are not really elegant or clean , e.gp  ol lipA precommit hook where if a file has been changed, some text like Modified gets added in the file and then when a reviewer specific user A reviews and changes the file, the keyword is removed by another hook. We we release, no files with this keyword in them can be released.pli lipDo a DIFF between current set of files to be released and last RELEASED files from tagrelease note or something, manually compare and find which files were not reviewed. pli lipAdd some metadataproperties to it, every time a file is reviewed and then process.pli ol  pWhat am I missing, any properties, keyword substitution or something else  Or should I just go ahead and look at off the shelf tools like Trac peer review, Crucible or Jupiter Eclipse Plugin etc. though none of them except Crucible provide me tracking of whether a fileversion has been reviewed before it gets released.p  pI have Eclipse IDEJenkinsSVNJIRAMavenQCSONAR already running.

Negative 902 pA while ago i wrote an Attached Behavior for two way syncronisation between a XamDataGrid and a Business Object as ObservableCollection. The XamDataGrid is the source and the ObservableCollection as DataSource is the Target. I did not use a ListCollectionView since for specific reasons.p  pstrongThe problemstrongp  pWhen the DataContext of the DataGrid is changed to another Vehicle the currently loaded DataGrid does not update the DependencyProperty of the behavior. p  pI cannot figure out why.p  pThe only solution i can think of is to hook the DataContextChanged of the DataGrid and do a new BindingOperation with a Path that is then set relative to the DataContext to figure out the SelectedItems property. But in that case the DependencyProperty of the behavior should be set to a Path to the SelectedItems property and not a binding.p  pstrongHaving the following classesstrongp  pA example modelp  precodepublic class Vehicle        public PassengerList Passengers  get set     public class PassengerList  ObservableCollectionltPassengergt       public PassengerList               SelectedPassengers  new ObservableCollectionltPassengergt           public ObservableCollectionltPassengergt SelectedPassengers  get private set    public class Passenger      public string Name  get set   codepre  pstrongThe xamlstrong p  precodeltigDGXamDataGrid DataSourceBinding Passengersgt ltiInteraction.Behaviorsgt    ltbXamDataGridSelectedItemsBehavior SelectedItemsBinding PathPassengers.SelectedPssengers gt ltiInteraction.Behaviorsgt ltigDGXamDataGridgt codepre  pPS I have also tried a Element binding to the DataGrid as element but that doesnt fix it.

Negative 902 pIts quite a topic, emblobs vs tables vs SQLem, and despite all I read so far I still cant find some proper reasoning on what to use when.p  pWe have a multitenant SaaS webapplication which we are about to move to Azure. We use an SQL Server 2008 database. We store documents and log information that belongs to the documents. Kinda like dropbox does. p  pThe forums state that you better use Azure Tables when you are considering large objects. We typically store hundreds of documents per user where the size of the documents vary from 5kb to 30mb where the vast majority will be around 1MB p  pAre there some ground rules when to go for Blobs, Tables, Sql I already learned that I shouldnt store my documents in SQL since it is too expensive. But when does it get beneficial to store the documents in Blobs and when would I be better of with tables Is there some kind of formula like p  pcodeif objects  MBobject  objectrequested gt y then blobs, else tablescodep
Negative 902 pIm just starting out learning OBJC but I do have an endgoal app that Im working toward building this app will be a masterdetail app on the iPad that will be required to keep itself updated with a webservice in real time. It will also need to send data to the remote MySQL DB when one of the multiple users on separate iPads performs certain actions within the app.p  pstrongEDIT As lxt has so helpfully clarified Is it appropriate to use push notifications as a cue to poll a webservice  the answer is sort of.strong p  pThe example Ive imagined for the purposes of this question is a Widget Inventory Manager that has incoming inventory that flows into the table view and inventory storage bins that the users will draganddrop inventory to in the detail view.p  pLike sop  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comK8iN9.jpg altenter image description herep  pstrongNOTE My application DOES NOT require itself to stay updated when not in the foreground. It can happily sleep away until its launched again at which point it would need to update itself with the most recent data. Kyle has provided an answer for this specific aspect of the problem using a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions4919950applicationwillenterforegroundreloaddatafromviewcontrollerapplicationWillEnterForegroundastrongp  pIn order to accomplish this without overtaxing my webservice server Ive imagined a solution that combines webservice polling and PUSH notifications to trigger the polls when one user iPad makes any changes to the data. So, the flow would be like sop  ol lipA default poll of the webservice would fire every minute regardless of any actions a user may perform.pli lipWhen a user drags an inventory item from the tableview and drops it in a storage bin that would initiate a PUSH notification to any other iPad logged in to the same overarching account and trigger a webservice poll to refresh its data.pli ol  pIn short Any time a user on iPad A changes anything a PUSH notification is sent to iPad B, iPad C, etc. When the PUSH is received by B,C,D, etc. they then poll the server to refresh their data.p  pThe alternative to this is to have every iPad on the account firing webservice polls every 15secs which seems bandwidthexpensive to me and would often result in no changes to the data.p  pMy question is less of a How do I ... and more of a How should I .... I realise StackOverflow may find this somewhat subjective, but I think this is a very worthy question considering Ive spent two days researching this specific practice using PUSH notifications to trigger webservice polling and found exactly zero relevent articles.p  pThanks for taking the time to read this. Any help would be appreciated. Example code andor specific frameworkkit information would be greatly appreciated. But really right now I just need to know if this is a good idea or not.p

Negative 902 pI have searched quite a bit, but all results I find deal with calendar apps, how to register apps as ics file handlers, etc.p  pInstead, the problem I have is the following We have a list of events on our page. We use PHP to dynamically create an .ics file for each event, so that it can be directly imported into the users calendar software. This works well with Outlook and on iOS download prompt on PC so I can open in Outlook, iPhone displays a file symbol and name and gives me an open in calendar option, but when I click the link from an Android device Galaxy S3, the browser just displays the .ics file as raw text, instead of opening it in a calendar or at least letting me download it.p  pIs there any way to make the browser open the file in the users calendar or at least download it, so that the user 1 doesnt see ugly text and 2 can import the file using some app of his own Or is there maybe a different file format that I could use or any other way, so that similar functionality can be achievedp  pRequiring the users to change some settings or use this or that app is not really an option, so it would be nice if there was a way to trigger such behaviour just using a link.p  pEdit Or, now that I think about it  is there even a standard format that would work across all or at least most Android devices They dont share any standard inbuilt calendar as far as I know, do theyp  pstrongUpdatestrong I have now managed to make it download the file had an error in my header information textxvCalendar instead of the correct textcalendar, that PC browser and iOS dont seem to notice, but Android did. I then had some parsing error, but that seems to come from empty lines that sometimes got into the files.p

Negative 902 pIm learning how to write character device drivers as dynamicallyloadable modules for the Linux. Typically I use the following sequence of function calls to register the device and create a device file which appears under codedevcodep  precodeallocchrdevregionampfirst, 0, 1, myclass myclass  classcreateTHISMODULE, myclass devicecreatemyclass, NULL, first, NULL, mydevicefile cdevinitampcdev, ampfops cdevaddampcdev, first, 1 codepre  pThe device file then appears at codedevmydevicefilecode and Im able to interact with it.p  pThis made me wonder what would happen if passed an existing device file name instead of emmydevicefileemp  precodedevicecreatemyclass, NULL, first, NULL, null codepre  pThis resulted in codedevnullcode being replaced by my character device file  and more concerning an onslaught of error messages in my console from daemons expecting the original codedevnullcode. Not even removing my faux codenullcode module fixed this.p  pWhile in practice there should not be an existing device file with the same name as the one my module uses, the fact that it is theoretically possible to overwrite another device file still bothers me.p  pHow do I protect against the case that a device file already exists with the same name as the one I intend to usep  pstrongUPDATEstrong I suppose what Im really tying to find out is why udev is permitting the replacement.p

Negative 902 pI am developing an application using Jboss AS 7, CDI, JPA, and some other resources bundled. p  pstrongMy question isstrong When I create a project in Eclipse using the mavenjbosswebapparchetype it generates some files, which I have been extensively studying and trying to get along with. The problem is that sometimes I see myself a little bit confused whether I am using Hibernate resources or JPA resources. p  pSecond question When I use multiple OneToMany relationships in the same Entity I notice two behaviors p  pa Without specifying EAGER type for Fetch, it deploys the application but when I try to use the list it gives me the LazyInitializationException error so vastly discussed here. p  pb When I specify Eager for the FetchType on the ToMany relationship it just doesnt deploys the application.

But I need to use multiple relationships in this entity in specific. I dont know what to do anymore, because I have tried several approaches, Lazy fetching, and all of them present some kind of issue. For example, if I leave only one FetchType.EAGER in the class then it deploys my app but it doesnt runs properly because when I try to fetch a List from the database it gives me the error strongLazyInitializationExceptionstrong, and when I try to put all of them using the FetchType.EAGER it just doesnt deploy because it gives the error Cannot instantiate multiple bags.p  pSo my issues here are related top  p1 Mavenjbosswebapparchetype uses hibernate or jpa or both 2 How can I attack this problem of using multiple OneToMany relationships in an Entity And although I know that fetching eagerly the Collections in the model is not the best approach because when the system grows I will probably have performance issues right So how can I properly work with Lazy loadingp

Negative 902 pFor any given Mutation is there an advantage to serializing an object to create a Value object to pass to said Mutation Or is it better to just pass a CharSequence Object.toString as the valuep  pOnly issue Ive found with using Values is that I have to deserialize the Value byte array to get a workable Object. This leads to the loss of some type resolution but ultimately I still have an instance of whatever the object was when I converted it to a Value.p  pThe problem I see with just storing a String is complete loss of type resolution, disregarding Strings of course, and the consequential need to have first hand knowledge of what the Object type was before hand, for the purposes of casting, if any form of analysis is to be performed.p  pAny Insightp

Negative 902 pSo to try and give you an idea of what im working with, I have two drop down boxes. The first drop down box has a list of 4 Applications. The second drop down box changes dynamically with my selection in the first drop down box. I have a chart for each selection in the second drop down box. I have 16 charts total. Each time i change the second selection, the chart changes so that there is only one chart showing at a time. Im using if else statements and it has become way to hard to keep up with.

Negative 902 pIm developing an address system which provides a mechanism to hide fixed addresses of applications e.g. IPbound. For example, a application may be referred to as codeAPP1code. If this application fails, this mechanism silently links the IPaddress of a backup instance to abstract address codeAPP1code. The program talking to codeAPP1code will however never notice this hidden address change.p  pCommonly, people refer to such behaviour as codetransparentcode even though hiding and making things invisible is exactly the oposite of making things transparent.p  pIs codetransparentcode the correct terminology And if yes, why Does the argument come from some different viewing perspectivep  pTo prevent comments and flags about this question being of topic Im writing a technical specification which is a very important step during system development, and therefore needs the same level of exactness as programming the system, hence just see this as a programming question in a little bit broader sense.p

Negative 902 pI am an experienced LabVIEW programmer but a newbie at C. I am using C on Visual Studio 2010. I am making a program to automate a wafer prober. I need to make a wafer map control that shows the current probe position, a different color for probedunprobed die, etc. A wafer map is a 2d grid of rectangles, where the height and width of rectangles is programmable at runtime. The color of each rectangle shows the status of that die on the wafer probing in progress, untested, passed, failed, etc. So for each X,Y location, there is a color that can indicate the die status. So far the only way I have seen to do this is to make a custom bitmap and display this in the GUI. Is this the only way to make a wafer map I am still coming up the learning curve on Windows Forms. Is there some shortcut I am missing using Forms or WPFp

Negative 902 pI am tentatively serving up a crap site with a good amount of traffic until new development is finished.p  pThe server is a 4GB cloud server with 2 CPU cores running NGINX, PHPFPM, APC, Memcached and a cloud database server Rackspace.p  pThe site, to let you know how bad it is, gave me an uncached load of 1.2 with JUST be roaming around on it quickly. Terrible. 170 queries per page, some with 2000 records or more. Terrible.p  pSo, being on Joomla, I enabled APC. QUICKLY snapped up the site to more than livable while we develop.p  pNow the site is live and consistently has 30  60 live visitors according to GA.p  pHeres the weird part. Regardless if I use APC or Memcached, as the site runs quickly at first after resetting phpfpm.. and then it goes for a while and gradually loads up and the CPU is at 1.x, 2.x and upward gradually. Never coming back down even after visits subdue a bit.p  pWhy is this happening Ive scoured the internet looking for any consistent direction for phpfpm settings, APC settings, etc.. Its so mismosh out there so Im hoping for some sound advice on calculating and determining what settings need to be as the demand changes.p  pBelow are my settings  at this point the only thing I can think of would be to CRON service phpfpm restart every 30 minutes or so.p  precode[APC] apc.stat  1 apc.maxfilesize  2M apc.localcache  1 apc.localcache.size  128M apc.shmsegments  1  apc.ttl  3600 apc.userttl  600 apc.gcttl  3600  apc.cachebydefault  1 apc.filters   apc.writelock  1 apc.numfileshint  7000 apc.userentrieshint  5000 apc.shmsize  64M apc.mmapfilemask  tmpapc.XXXXXX apc.includeonceoverride  0 apc.fileupdateprotection  2 apc.canonicalize  1 apc.reportautofilter  0 apc.statctime  0  apc.stat  0 codepre  pthis also ends up fragmenting pretty hard  I have apc.php available if anyone needs more informationp  precodepm  dynamic pm.maxchildren  80 pm.startservers  32 pm.minspareservers  16 pm.maxspareservers  56 pm.maxrequests  1000 codepre  pIve played with these.. never seems to make much difference but I dont think Ive found any sound advice eitherp  pAny help or pointers would be greatly appreciated p

Negative 902 pIve got an application which is working perfectly fine on Weblogic 11. But when trying to run it on weblogic 12c, I get this exceptionp  precode... Caused by java.lang.IllegalStateException No Factories configured for this Application. This happens if the facesinitialization does not work at all  make sure that you properly include all configuration settings necessary for a basic faces application and that all the necessary libs are included. Also check the logging output of your web application and your container for any exceptions If you did that and find nothing, the mistake might be due to the fact that you use some special webcontainers which do not support registering contextlisteners via TLD files and a context listener is not setup in your web.xml. A typical config looks like this ltlistenergt   ltlistenerclassgtorg.apache.myfaces.webapp.StartupServletContextListenerltlistenerclassgt ltlistenergt      at javax.faces.FactoryFinder.getFactoryFactoryFinder.java286     at javax.faces.FactoryFinder.getFactoryFactoryFinder.java206     ... codepre  pIve got this listener in my web.xml.

I realized that if I can treat the codeint[]code array as a byte array then I can simply modify the bytes directly, instead of doing all this shifting, which I imagine would be faster. However, I cant figure out how to do that.p  pWhat I want is to have codeint[] pixelDatacode and codebyte[] pixelDataBytescode both point to the memory. Just be two different views of the same bits in memory if you understand what I mean. Then I can update the individual bytes as they come in without shifting them, while still maintaining the codeint[]code representation I need for other parts of the code. It seems like this should be possible, but I havent figured out how to do it yet.p

Our password policies require 15character minimum passwords, and obviously these wont fit when we run the application in Windows 8. p  pBecause the character sizes change with the operating system not application side, we suspect the problem is with a .dll file or a font that is being referenced by the PowerBuilder application. Are there any ideas where the password mask is being calledp

Negative 902 pI have a WCF service which uses claims based authorization.p  pWhat I want to do is to attribute an operation with a codeClaimsPrincipalPermissionAttributecode and only have the authorization check trigger once in my custom codeClaimsAuthorizationManagercode. However I am finding that this authorization check is being triggered twice once for the URL and then a second time on the operation itself.p  pI cant find much information on this subject, but what I have found indicates that this is by design. Is it possible for me to overwrite this behavior and not perform any authorization on the URL, and only authorization based on the operationp  pI have no interest in authorizing based on URLs, and would really rather avoid adding claims for each and every URL as I am likely to have a lot of them and they may change in future.p  pI have read several articles, and seen videos from Dominick Baier on this subject, and while I have learnt a lot from these I still cant find an answer to this. Is this simply not possible and I just have to deal with having to authorize based on the URL as wellp

Is there a way to have a folder tree structure of projects AND have this structure be reflected on my computers actual file system  I tried using working sets, but when I view my workspace folder in Windows Explorer, the folder structure is still flat and also working sets apparently cant be nested.  I also tried putting project folders in subfolders in Windows Explorer, and then going back into Eclipse and both hitting refresh in the package explorer which resulted in the moved projects not being recognized at all and going to import  existing projects into workspace which resulted in the moved projects being recognized but still being shown in a flat structure in the package explorer.p  pIdeally, what I would like is for any changes to the folder structure in Eclipse to be immediately and automatically reflected in the computers file system, and to be able to change the folder structure in Windows Explorer and hit refresh in Eclipses package explorer and have Eclipse recognize the new structure.  Is there any way to do this in Eclipse  Or if not, is there some other Java IDE that can do thisp

As bdl comes in initially it has length 15, so x will equal 1.4 . The first time through the loop the first println says X  1.4 so count  20 which is correct. The second time through however when x should  0.4, it instead says X  0.3999999999999999 so count  7. I understand that casting x20 to an int at that point and time will give me 7, but my question is Why is x not equal to 0.4 .p

Negative 902 pI have a project idea which is suggested by my lecturer to create an adhoc mobile network using WiFidirect available in android mobile phones. the purpose of this network is to send data over a long distance from one android device to another using several other android devices as intermediate nodes and also to use a MANET routing protocol for path selection when theres more than one path available to reach the destination.  I have looked into some of the questions related to this where some have asked how to implement a similar type of network but most of those answers were pretty old at which time WiFidirect was not available widely, as I assume.  Im pretty much new to android and Im learning it now for this purpose. so I would like to know weather this can be done using an android app, some guidelines to start if possible and any sample codes i can refer to get this done.p  pThank you in advance.p

Negative 902 pI have a Google Marketplace app that is currently using OpenID for federated login.p  pWhen an admin installs the application to the domain users are able to login via a site.comlogindomain.com link.p  pCurrently when a user uses this link they are being asked to consent once again for Know who you are on Google scope. I understand that this is something to do with my OpenID realm not matching. The problem is I cannot find where to edit that realm in the new console. My research shows that OpenID has been abandoned for OAuth2 authentication. Please correct me if I am wrong.p  pIs there a good example anywhere that shows how to authenticate a user that an admin has already granted scopes for on the domain so that they strongdo not get asked to consent againstrong Ive looked up and seen documentation to make a call to a hrefhttpsaccounts.google.comooauth2auth relnofollowhttpsaccounts.google.comooauth2autha but Im unaware of how to actually skip the user consent since the admin already authorized the scopes domainwide.p  pUsing C but Im open to any example as Im sure I can figure out how to get it back into C.p

Negative 902 pI have been using C for about a year now, but so far the only things I have programmed has been useless console applications. I would really like to try my hand at GUIs, but the problem is that I have had a VERY hard time to find out where to start  I have been searching this forum and others and the most common reply is to try out Qt. Thats cool, but I need somebody to push me in the right direction  are there any books or websites that give a thoughoug walkthrough of GUIs AND which is written in a language for mortals Thanks in advance Andersp

Negative 902 pHi I have written some code for calling a stored procedure in a MySQL database using a MariaDB client, however the stmtbind parameter is not being populated with the necessary MYSQLBIND array for receiving the necessary data.p  pAm I doing something wrong or is there a bug with the driver  Mallocing the data does not break the implementation, but MySQL has its own more efficient means of managing memory for these arrays than malloc.p  pIf you are asking, I am using and abusing a switch statement, as I would like this function to be made eventually asynchronous in a cooroutine functor class working against a pool of connections, where a state value is used to control where we are in the switch statement.p  precodethe function that does all the heavy lifting for persistence

Negative 902 pI am using Visual Studio Express 2012 for the VB.net frontend and an Access 2010 database for the backend with an ODBC System DSN as the connection link.p  pI have the following two tables with their respective fieldsp  pstrongtblRepairRequeststrong [ID], [RequestType], [SubmitterFirstName], [SubmitterLastName],  [SubmitterIDNumber], [DateSubmitted], [TimeSubmitted], [SupervisorFirstName], [SupervisorLastName], [SupervisorIDNumber], [PositionLocation], [ProblemDescription], [DateClosed], [TimeClosed], [Status] strongWherestrong [ID] is the primary key Auto generated number by the databasep  pstrongtblRepairRequstNotesstrong [ID], [RepairRequestID], [NoteType], [UserFirstName], [UserLastName], [UserIDNumber], [DateNoted], [TimeNoted], [Notes] strongWherestrong [ID] is the primary key Auto generated number by the database and [RepairRequestID] is the foreign key the primary key from tblRepairRequestp  pThere is a 1tblRepairRequest to ManytblRepairRequestNotes relationship between the two tables.p  pI have created a form with all the fields in these two tables laid out on the form.  This will be used to search the database.  The more fields on the form the user enters data into, the more refined the search will get using AND with LIKE in the SQL statement.p  pI do not not want to show duplicates to the user.  So lets say the query runs and you get the following based on the search criteriap  p6 records from tblRepairRequest matched [ID] 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, amp 6p  p10 records from tblRepairRequestNotes matched [RepairRequestID] 1, 1, 4, 4, 4, 9, 9, 9, 15, 16p  pThese should be combined so that the results are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 9, 15, 16.  Since the combined results are in essence my primary key [ID] from tblRepairRequest, I want the user to see the following fields from tblRepairRequest in a datagridview as the search results for each one of the [ID] numbers from those combined results p  p[ID], [RequestType], [SubmitterFirstName], [SubmitterLastName], [SubmitterIDNumber], [DateSubmitted], [TimeSubmitted], [DateClosed], [TimeClosed], [Status]p  pThis way I can have the user doubleclick a result and then I can show more details in a new form.p  pWhat I need help with is the SQL statements.  I just need to understand how the basic format of  the statements needs to be. I am assuming there will be joins which for the life of me I am just not grasping.  Or maybe it needs to be done differently, like two separate queries and then somehow merge those results together, I really dont know.  I tried searching and nothing seemed right for what I am trying to do, either that or I am just totally lost which very well could be.  Once I have the basic query structure down, I can get the rest. I will fill in the code to dynamically build the statement based on what data fields are filled in by the user.  I am not using a binding source.  I am doing it by code using data adapters, data sets, data views, and data tables and then I set the source property on my datagridview.p  pThanks in advancep

Negative 902 pIm writing an App.net client and using ADNKit as the framework that communicates with the ADNs servers.

Negative 902 p.NET 4.5 changed the implementation of Array.Sort to what is called introspective sort which is a hybrid algorithm, consisting of choosing between quicksort, insertionsort, and heapsort depending on the input data.  It is detailed herep  pa hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibrary6tf1f0bcvvs.110.aspx relnofollowhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibrary6tf1f0bcvvs.110.aspxap  pIt is well documented that the sort is unstable, meaning two elements containing the same sort order value may or may not preserve the order from the original input.  However, I need to know whether or not it is deterministic, in the sense that any arbitrary input data will reproducibly return the same output data every time it is sorted.  Specifically, I know that quicksort can be implemented either deterministically or nondeterministically if the pivot is chosen at random, but Im not sure which implementation is used for .NETs introspective sort.  p  pFrom my testing, it seems to be deterministic, as I have not seen any particular set of data return differently between runs, but obviously you cant prove something doesnt exist simply because you havent seen it p  pI suppose I plan on looking at the code to help try to figure out whether or not introspective sort is deterministic, but I was hoping that someone here knows offhand and can save me the effort p  pThanks    Ryanp

Negative 902 pI want to be able to move a node from Point A to Point B by following through a custom bezier path by using applyImpulse method of SKPhysicsBody. The reason I want to use the applyImpulse is because it simulates a nice natural movement starting fast and slowing down depending on the initial impulse. It seems that when an object is applied impulse via applyImpulse, it only stops when the friction with environment causes its speed to reduce to zero. I want it to follow my path and stop at the end. How could I go about it p

Negative 902 pIn the SQLite documentation, it statesp  precodeDeferred means that no locks are acquired on the database until the database is first accessed. Thus with a deferred transaction, the BEGIN statement itself  does nothing to the filesystem. Locks are not acquired until the first read or  write operation.  codepre  pBut when does this first read or write actually occur  Suppose I start a deferred transaction, then do a bunch of INSERTs or UPDATEs, then a COMMIT.  Am I correct in thinking that the first write should not occur until I actually do the commit, or is it possible that the write might occur before thatp  pI basically want to allow multiple threads to perform transactions consisting of multiple inserts or updates, without the possibility of blocking other threads due to the way the design was done, if this occurs there will be a deadlock.  I dont care about the order of the insertsupdates between threads, only that each set is done at the same time as a single transaction.p

Negative 902 pIm looking for a way to monitor,on group owner side, any new incoming WiFi p2p connection using wifi direct, whenever a group already exists. I mean, let suppose we have a group which consists of two devices, D1 as group owner and D2 as client. A third device D3 wants to join the existing group as client. So, it D3 calls connect method towards D1. Now D1 should add D3.  Which is the notification which tells me that everything has been correctly done on group owner side I know, for sure, that WIFIP2PCONNECTIONCHANGEDACTION is used in order to notify that a new connection has been established for the first time .Is it valid for every client which wants to join the group after it has been createdp  pNote Im interested in knowing what happens on group owner side, not on client.p  pThanks in advance for your time.p

Negative 902 pI have a kind of general question I wrote several unit tests for a bunch of connected classes and all unit tests are succeeding.p  pHowever, after implementing my first integration tests I got some errors because I didnt take some shared behavior between the classes into account.p  pMy question is Am I supposed to fix my unit tests because they failed to find the bugs Are unit tests not supposed to take the other classes into account and I just bugfix my productive code because it is sufficient that the integration test cover such things.p  pEDITp  pdue to the responses it seems necessary to specify my problem further. I am still not sure which test is responsible for what.p  pLets assume I have a classlets call it ListClass which contains a list of objects, an index, a getCurrentValue, and a incrementIndex function. I guess the function names speak for themselves.p  pThe index starts with 1 and if you call getCurrentValue with 1 it returns you nullp  pI also have a reset function which sets the start index back to 1.p  pOkay my tests have 100 code coverage, I created mutants which were detected by my tests, so everthing seems fine.p  pMy second class is a handler which is responsible to set all Permutations everytime i call Handler.Next. p  precode listContainer1.index  1, listContainer2.index  1,  handler.addlistContainer1 has 2 values handler.addlistContainer2 has 2 values  handler.next  listContainer1.index  0, listContainer2.index  0 handler.next  listContainer1.index  0, listContainer2.index  1 handler.next  listContainer1.index  1, listContainer2.index  0 handler.next  listContainer1.index  1, listContainer2.index  1 codepre  pAgain 100 code coverage, mutants were detected I used mocking to define the behaviour of the listContainerp  pHere is the Integration test which broke the code Calling reset on a listContainer, after several handler.next calls Because the container index was 1 the next handler.next call resulted in an not expected state.p  pHow can I predict such an outcome in an unit test in my handler without being depent on my ListClass Or as I asked in my original post .. Is it sufficient if the integration test catches the error.p  pFor me it seems both unit test classes covered their own responsibilities ...p

Negative 902 pI am building a generic visualizer of objects with GWT. For this, I am using the reflection capabilities offered by a hrefhttpscode.google.compgwtent relnofollowgwtenta. With it I can explore methods and fields and thats enough for classes. One problem I still have is that gwtent does not allow me to explore arrays. It gives me the type of its components, but not a get or a set method, as java.lang.reflection.Array does.p  pSo I have used the native java.lang.reflection.Array, which curiously works when in debug mode how is that possible, but when I go into production mode the compiler complains.p  pI have tried some tricks, for instance by converting the array to an ArrayList with java.utils.Array.asListT... a but theres not way for making it work. I have seen a similar problem a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions4972709creatingnewarraywithclassobjectingwtherea.

Negative 902 pIm going to implement an element in Angular which would be able to set a value to a hidden field and change a state of the element on mouse click.

Negative 902 pI want to keep a map of singleton objects based on their ID, just to ensure that everyone gets the same copy. The creation of these objects happens seldom, and I dont want or need the overhead of a concurrent map which will internally keep essentially multiple maps in memory. But I do need the map to support weak keys, so that when nobody is using a particular instance the record will be dropped from the map.p  pSo what choice do I have Guava codeMapMakercode and codeCacheBuildercode create concurrent maps, which use a lot more memory than I need. I dont need concurrency  I just need thread safety. Yes, I could set the concurrency level to code1code, but according to the API documentation this is is only a hint, and may be ignored altogether in the future.p  pI could use Java Collections to create a simple synchronized codeHashMapcode and use codeputIfAbsent...code, but that doesnt give me the benefit of weak values. I could store weak references, but they wouldnt automatically be expunged on access of the map.p  pIf I had a version of Javas codeWeakHashMapcode that supported weak values instead of weak keys, I could wrap it in a synchronized map and be done with it.p  pI believe that long ago Apache Commons Collections had a map builder that allowed the specification of weak values, but were using Guava instead.p  pAny suggestions And please, read the full question before jumping to throw in a suggestion Ive already mentioned.p

I wonder whether is the author of this plugin close the website to provide this service or not. If they do stop the service now, please also let me know, so I can give up using it anymore.p  pThis is the fourth time Im asking a question in this website.with no answer last three which is diametrically different from what I expect Hope any genius can give a answer this time.

Negative 902 pIve searched for this a bit on Stack, but I cannot find a definitive answer for https, only for solutions that somehow include http or unencrypted parameters which are not present in my situation.p  pI have developed an iOS application that communicates with MySQL via Apache HTTPS POSTS and php.p  pNow, the server runs with a valid certificate, is only open for traffic on port 443 and all posts are done to a hrefhttpsthedomain.netobscurefolderobscurefile.php relnofollowhttpsthedomain.netobscurefolderobscurefile.phpap  pIf someone knew the correct parameters to post, anyone from anywhere in the world could mess up the database completely, so the question is Is this method secure Let it be known nobody has access to the source code and none of the iPads that run this software are jailbreaked or otherwise compromised.p  pEdit in response to answers There are several php files which alone only support one specific operation and depend on very strict input formatting and correct license key retreived by SQL on every query. They do not respond to input at all unless its 100 correct and has a proper license e.g. password included. There is no actual website, only php files that respond to POSTs, given the correct input, as mentioned above. The webserver has been scanned by a third party security company and contains no known vulnerabilities.p

Negative 902 pIm trying to develop my first Jenkins plugin and Im not sure about several issues br So far I have a class that creates a new job type. It basically looks just like the FreeStyleProject of Jenkins and it works fine. brbr 1 Now I would like the plugin to create an additional section on the configuration page of the job of the new type. I tried adding a config.jelly in the resources package, but it didnt work. Then I copied Jenkins configureentries.jelly from resourceshudsonmodelProject and added my information here. Is it ok to do it like this br 2 Furthermore, I want to add something to the project page. I found out that a file called jobMain.jelly can be used for that, but just creating the file in the resources package doesnt change anything. So instead I copied Jenkins main.jelly from resourceshudsonmodelAbstractProject and added something here. Is that ok It works, but Im not sure if I can get into trouble later. brbr Thanks in advancep

Negative 902 pGiven two convex polygons which may or may not overlap they should be layed out such that they dont overlap  see comments in the tightest possible way. I.e. they should take up as little screen real estate as possible.  Formally lets define the tightest possible way to be the one whose bounding box is of the minimum area but Im open to other sensible definitions as well .  NB Everything here is in 2D. A bonus would be to even consider the ratio of the sides of the bounding box e.g. that it should be 169 but I suspect itd be too much to ask .p  pIs there a betterthanbruteforce algorithm to do this Brute force would be like laying them out in every possible direction and calculate the area of the bounding box.  Ive been looking for a solution but I havent found one though it doesnt look to be a very unique problem to me...p  hr  pThis is what I do now which is emapproximate onlyem to the requirements above  I take one polygon fixed codep1code and calculate its center point codec1code. I then find the point on the circumflex of codep1code which is the closest to codec1code lets call it codexcode. Note The codec1, xcode vector will define the direction of movement of codep2code.  Lets then define the separatng axis as a line perpendicluar to codec1,xcode at codexcode. The two polygons will touch at codexcode at the end.  Then I calculate y which is the farthest point of codep2code from the separating axis in the direction of codex,c1code vector reversed lets call its distance codedcode.  I then move codep2code in the direction of codec1,xcode by codedcode.p  pIt ensures that codep2code is as close to the center of codep1code as possible  unfortunately with regard to codep1code only.  But it does not take codep2codes shape into account so it may be that they can be placed tighter by choosing a different displacement direction.p

Negative 902 pIn my office, many of us use SSRS to schedule recurring reports. I want to view the schedule of upcoming report runs, for the next few days or a week, so that we can see whether 20 reports are all going to try to run at the same time. How can I accomplish that  Ive created tsql reports that show subscription information, but they only show last run dates and times.  Thats not helpful for predicting tomorrows bottlenecks. The solution should include datadriven subscriptions too.p

Negative 902 pIve made a today widget for the german ice hockey league DEL.p  pIm loading the next games from our server an show them in a tableView. The loading process is started in the proposed method widgetPerformUpdateWithCompletionHandler. Initially im loading some cached data in viewWillAppear.p  pEverything works great so farp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comI6bGI.png altScreenshot of the working widget.p  pBut after a while one day the widget stops working. When I open the notification center the widget appears normal, but it is never updated again. I have to remove the widget from the notification center and have to add it again. After that the widget works for a day and then again it stops working.p  pTo see what the widget ist doing, Ive added a simple white view with a status text above the table view while loading the data in widgetPerformUpdateWithCompletionHandler to see if the widget is doing anything. The white view appears when the widget is working. When it is not working the status view doesnt appear. So I think the method widgetPerformUpdateWithCompletionHandler isnt called after the widget is active in the notification center for a while.p  pIve got no clue what causes the widget to stop working. Any ideasp

Negative 902 pI have a Sprite in my scene and there is a particle emitter inside this sprite. So, when I move the sprite using MoveTo action, then i can see moving animation for both, sprite and particle emitter. MoveTo animation wasnt affected to old particles which were emitted before animation was started and i can see something like a tail, like from a comet. So everything is ok. Now, if i will create move action for sprite and move it by, let say, 100 pixels up and make an action with 100 pixels down for emitter then emitter will move by 100 pixels relatively to sprite, but will stay still relatively to screen and there will be no comet tail effect. So, it means that emitted particles arent belong to sprite, but to something else. p  pSo, my question is how can I make move comet tail effect without actual moving relatively to screen Or imagine, I have a layer with a sun emitter. And on some point I will decide to move this layer scroll it and my sun emitter will also scrolls with the layer, but old emitted particles will make comet tail effect because theyre not belong to the layer, but to something else. How can move that scene without comet tail effectp  pThank Youp

Negative 902 pThe hosting provider for one of the web sites I manage has forced us to only be able to modify the site as a web project instead of as a web application. When it was initially a web application it was working fine, but after converting to a web site project I had many issues involving missing namespaces and references and was able to resolve them by placing all of my libraries inside of the toplevel AppCode folder of the web site.

Negative 902 pI am now working on a solar tracker project with the ATMEGA1284P and, after configuring PWM it is time for discovering the mechanical limitations of the tracker so I can define boundaries for the servos.p  pFor this, I have prepared a simple code.

The idea is to move a servo with two pushbuttons connected to gnd and later configure UART so I can send the current servo position to my computer. Ive tried also go call the pwmset1 function outside of the if loops but it doesnt respond at all.p  pThe switches are also wired up correctly and Ive also checked with voltmeter on the uC pins and they are both working fine, i.e. GND when pressed, pullup resistors configured as yo can see in the code below.p  pAny suggestions are highly appreciated.

Negative 902 pIve inherited a frontend project which is using Three.js to render a map, and its animating the position of a car on that map based on data that comes regularly. So youve got this little car driving along on this little map, and thats fine.p  pBut Ive been tasked with adding an overlay onto this scene  which is great, because this legacy project already added an overlay scene and is using the same camera to render it, as well, so anything added to the overlay scene shows up over the map, and theres logic to make sure that it remains positioned over the map correctly as the map moves around within the viewport as this thing runs.p  pWith me so farp  pHeres the problem I need to specify the size x and z of my overlay in pixels. The overlay is designed to fit over the map, so whatever size the map is is the size the overlay should be. But the map is a .dae file and the overlay is a .svg file and as far as I can tell neither one encodes actual specific size information.p  pSo. Given that I have access to the THREE.js scenes, camera, etc, all I want to do is reverse engineer the size of the underlying map. I can get the viewport size, but thats not what Im after  I want the length and width of the rectangle representing the map, and I know that the camera is 50 units up from the surface. There must be some way to get these two numbers, and it would make my life so simple.p  pSo, uh, does anyone know how I should go about doing this I tried looking at various Three.js docs and guides but this is a pretty specific use case and I didnt find anything after a cursory examination.p

Negative 902 pI just received an email this morning that testflightapp.com will no longer be active as of 2262015, and that I should be using the iTunes Connect TestFlight service instead. This is fine and dandy for app store apps, but most of my projects are enterprise apps, and that is not supported in iTunes Connect. On top of that, iTunes Connect TestFlight requires iOS 8, and a good chunk of Enterprise users are still on iOS 7. p  pDoes anyone have a solution outside of TestFlight for deploying Enterprise iOS apps to a set of registered users I am hoping there is an easier solution than setting up my own MDM, but at this point I think that may be the only option.p

Negative 902 pI have implemented a dynamical system in NetLogo using rk4, which makes the updation extremely slow. I cant observe anything when see the model. Is there any efficent way to record the simulation. p  pI know not much about graphics what does frame rate mean, does increasing that be of any helpp  pFrom what I understand how NetLogo does it is it records each update of view and plays at a specified frame rate. But in my case I want the frame rate to extremely high like about 1k10k frames per sec. So what I am trying to do, is depending upon the frame rate, make Netlogo record lesser snapshots of the view.  I dont know if I am conceptual wrong somewhere. p  pSo essentially a correlation btw the frame rate and snapshots of view recording to discard frames which may not have such a effect in the overall video playing at such high rate.p

Negative 902 pIm observing an apparent discrepancy between the results of the EXACT function and the conditional formatting tool.  p  pTwo cells in Column B have the same apparent text about 3040 words.  But the highlight cells tool doesnt recognize them as duplicate values. Comparing the two cells with the EXACT function returns TRUE, however.  This also occurs when comparing the results of the CLEAN function applied to both cells. The cells include characters like  and square brackets although why that should be a problem I dont know, especially since other such cell are correctly identified as duplicates by conditional formatting tool.  p  pCan anyone suggest why this might be happeningp  pAn example, obfuscated with Uuppercase, xlowercase and ddigit   p  blockquote   pUFOUO UUUUU Increment d shall comply with current UUUxxx and UUUU Meta Data Repository MDR commercial, DoD, and Intelligence Community IC metadata standards and shall have a xxxxxxxxxxxx controlled metadata tagging capability to tag all messages, products, and data files that are posted to the network MRICObjective.

Negative 902 pI have a website which users register an account. On the registration field, the form fields arep  ul liNameli liEmailli liConfirm emailli liUsernameli ul  pBut there is no password field. When they hit submit, they are emailed a password which is very complex, such as strongLHJVjhwnvuu5strong or strongRbWM9jeDZUQbstrong.p  pI have appealed to my developer to instead make it so that the users can set their own password on the registration form. To confirm that password on the form, and then be sent a confirmation link to their specified email. Then this way they can at least log in to their account and verify their email via confirmation link. Or if they didnt, every time they log into the site it could remind them to verify their email etc or else they cant do much on the site example. This way even if they strongdont getstrong the confirmation link, they can strongstillstrong update their account email to a different email strongand have it resentstrong. At least at this stage, they can log into their account, instead of strongnot at allstrong.p  pThe response I have received from the developer is as followsp  blockquote   pThe problem with providing the password on registration is that   youll have loads of fake accounts. So people that just register with   a nonexistent email address. At least with the email validation   youre proving the user exists, to a certain extent. If they register with the wrong email, they can just reregister.p blockquote  pstrongId like to ask you all if the current approach the developer has employed is acceptablestrongp  pstrongIf not, what are some good reasons I could use to convince the developer to changestrongp  pIve tried to explain the followingp  ul lipEvery day there are 910 people who register strongand thenstrong directly use the password reset form strongright afterstrong. This form involves them putting in their email address that they signed up with, and then it emails them a link to SET a new password. So if they are setting a new password stronganywaystrong, why not just have them set it in the first place on the registration form Why would there be 910 people every single day using the password reset field, directly after registration Im pretty sure its because they are seemingly struggling with these complex passwords which I am not against that are being emailed to them and are missing a key or character, or do not seem to be aware of copypaste or something like that. If they could just set their own password the strongfirst time aroundstrong, they wouldnt need to run to the password reset field right after because of their emailed password not working. I thought it was weird how everyday theres always password reset emails. Not for everyone, but a good 910 people a day ever since I started using Mandrillapp to track the outgoing emails. This is backed up by the next point.pli lipEvery day there are at least 23 people who fill out the contact form indicating that the password they received is not working. Could all be avoided if they just could set it on their own. There may be even more that just dont bother contacting.pli lipOut of nearly 8000 accounts, 50 have never logged in. My strong suspicion is that the Registration email containing their password goes to their junk folderspam folder. This is despite me having proper SPF, DKIM, etc setup. 2 months ago, I decided to start using Mandrill to send mail to ensure it goes to the inbox, but still theres at least 12 peopleday that say that they did strongnotstrong get their email.. which perplexes me. If they could define their own password, they wouldnt have to worry about waiting for their password via email, or not getting it entirely. This just further highlights my initial concern.pli ul  pThank you for your timep

Negative 902 pI have a 2d array of vectors of pointers to Entities in a game. The array represents a grid of game world to improve performance when detecting collisions. When an entity moves I check if it moves over to another gridtile of course but this is where everything goes to hell. If I move the object in the array when it changes tile CPU goes to 100 instead of 8 and game physics no longer apply.p  pThis is the update function where it stops workingp  precode    for int i  0 i lt xGridCount i              for int j  0 j lt yGridCount j                      for auto it  grid[i][j]                               itgtupdate                    update gridpos                 if int itgtxgridSize  i  int itgtygridSize  j                                      grid[itgtxgridSize][itgtygridSize].emplacebackstdmoveit                                             codepre  pDeclaration of grid arrayp  precodestdarrayltstdarrayltstdvectorltstdsharedptrltEntitygtgt, yGridCountgt, xGridCountgt grid codepre  pThe update gridpos is where it collapses.

But the thing about that would be that I would have to keep 2 pointers of every object, one for hit detection and one for updatingrendering and that doesnt sound like a good solution.p  pWhy is it so CPU heavy And how else could I do itp

This will allow the addition of these listeners that I will be creating to any JComponentp  precode    import java.awt.AWTEvent     import java.awt.BorderLayout     import java.awt.Component     import java.awt.Graphics     import java.awt.LayoutManager     import java.awt.Toolkit     import java.awt.event.AWTEventListener     import java.util.ArrayList     import java.util.EventObject     import javax.swing.JComponent   public class MyJComponentDecorator extends JComponent implements MyListener      protected JComponent child  public MyJComponentDecoratorJComponent c      child  c     this.setLayoutnew BorderLayout     this.addchild   Override public void eventDispatchedAWTEvent e      System.out.printlne         Override public void addGlobalListener      final MyJComponentDecorator component  new MyJComponentDecoratorchild      Toolkit.getDefaultToolkit.addAWTEventListenercomponent, AWTEvent.MOUSEMOTIONEVENTMASK          AWTEvent.MOUSEEVENTMASK          AWTEvent.KEYEVENTMASK      this.addcomponent    codepre  pAnd my main class for testingp  precodepublic static void mainString[] args      try          JFrame frame  new JFrame         frame.setDefaultCloseOperationJFrame.EXITONCLOSE         frame.setSize500, 500         frame.setLayoutnew FlowLayout          MyJComponentDecorator button  new MyJComponentDecoratornew JButtonA Button         button.addGlobalListener         frame.getContentPane.addbutton, null          frame.setVisibletrue            catch Exception e          e.printStackTrace          codepre  pThis is currently everything that I have and it compiles and runs just fine, but the global listener is still listening to the entire frame and not just the button as intended. I realize that what I am trying to do sounds counter intuitive trying to get a global listener to not listen globally, but from what the assignment details say it seems like that is what my professor wants so I am really confused. Sorry if this is drawn out I just did not want to leave anything out, any help is greatly appreciated.p

Ive installed the linuximage3.16.04amd64amd64 kernel because I think it is not possible to get more than 3GB of memory on a PAE machine.p  pUnfortunately, the whole toolchainlibraries are still i386. I guess I need a special flavour of GCC multilib and the amd64 version of some libraries.p  pIve found tutorials on how to compile 32bit stuff on 64bit rootfs systems, but not the other way round. I dont want to crossgrade the whole system to amd64 just for this test, sop  pIs there a way to safely compile and run 64bit code on this setup with as little changes to the system as necessary Ideally it would be possible to crossgrade from this setup at some point in the future. Alternately, would it be possible to create a 64bit chroot environment from a Debian Live CD, chroot into it, compile the code and run it from there Or compile it statically and run it outside the chrootp  pstrongEDITstrong Installing gmultilib solves the problem compiling 64bit using the codem64code option. Can anyone help with the chroot  crossgrade part of my questionp
Negative 902 pI need to announce some text to all users of my application when they perform some action. To do so I use codeAVSpeechSynthesizercode.

Negative 902 pI have a UIView shaped like a circle that expands and contracts. strongI need to have a sublayer positioned at its center  that stays the same size as it is animatingstrong. The code below contains four sample views showing things I have tried. It can be copied and pasted as is.p  ol liThe first UIView is a not animated. Its sublayer is positioned at its center, but strongit has to be positioned relative to the UIViews origin. This is a problem when UIViews bounds and origin is changing during an animation.strongli liThe second UIView has two animations one for codeboundscode and one for codecornerRadiuscode. This arrangement causes the sublayer to end up at the screens origin top left.li liThe third UIView also has two animations this time for codebounds.sizecode and codecornerRadiuscode. The sublayer stays the same size, which is good, but it does not stay at the center of the UIView. I tried to use code[thirdView.layer setNeedsDisplayOnBoundsChangeYES]code to compensate for the bounds change but it didnt work. I also tried    codethirdView.contentMode  UIViewContentModeRedrawcode.li liThe fourth UIView has one animation for codetransform.scalecode, which seems to be a bit more efficient as far as expansion animations go. The sublayer stays at the center of the UIView like I want it, but it does not stay the same size.

Negative 902 pHey guys i am having an issue with java script and implementing a chart dashboard for my spread sheet. For testing purpose i have followed a tutorial by google to create a chart dashboard using my own spreadsheet. I tried to create a simple chart by substituting the URL address with my own spread sheet URL however this sort of backfired on me as i get this error message Data columns for axis 0 cannot be of type string p  pA copy of the table i am trying to implement into a chart is located here a hrefhttpsdocs.google.comspreadsheetsd10fFAoMxyLx1apRXiepR91UJXO2KA5ucRx2XB66bc4Qedituspsharing relnofollowhttpsdocs.google.comspreadsheetsd10fFAoMxyLx1apRXiepR91UJXO2KA5ucRx2XB66bc4Qedituspsharinga it form 3 called Attendance Record which i want as a chartp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comW3Ese.png altscreenshotp  pso i followed the steps of the first link from google and edited to make sure it links right and points to a selected range of cells but changed the gid to gid3 as i read that the number at the end represents what form you are referring to. Then i specified the range at the end of the link by adding amprangeB2C4 as i only want the name and number columns to be in the chartp  pThe link below is the one i edited and replaced .p  pa hrefhttpsdocs.google.comspreadsheetsd1FOVmfesx7ATNe8qjWjkU2GbjBCBZxL0BRswJv6rcGPseditgid3amprangeB1C4 relnofollowhttpsdocs.google.comspreadsheetsd1FOVmfesx7ATNe8qjWjkU2GbjBCBZxL0BRswJv6rcGPseditgid3amprangeB1C4a p  pbut for some reason it bring up the error message as stated in my question.p  pUltimately correct me if i am wrong but i think it is something to do with the URL link i am using because i tried it with another link that they used as an example and it worked. I even copy and pasted the same data they used into my spreadsheet and then copied the url and still it didnt work. p  pSo how do you get the correct linkp

Negative 902 pI created web service consumer using Axis 1.4 tool. It generated java classes which I am trying to use in order to call web service methods. But for some reason I got 503 Service Unavailable error in log no matter which method I would call. When I created xml soap request message and sent it with curl I received correct response so it must be problem on client my side. Is it possible that Axis somehow builds faulty request messages I suspect that it calls wrong service so I obtain 503 error code. If it does how can I check it so I could fix itp

Negative 902 pIm running application logic through JavaScript in an iOS app with the help of JavaScriptCore codeJSContextcodes. Recently, the need to use some kind of Promise library emerged and unfortunately, the WebKitnative Promise implementation doesnt work in headless codeJSContextcodes. However, all the PromiseA libraries require some mechanism to dispatch a callback to the message queue, and in browsers, the option with the best performance is codesetImmediatecode nowadays.p  pHowever, neither codesetImmediatecode nor any of the mechanisms which are typically used in browsers to polyfill it are available in a headless codeJSContextcode like codepostMessagecode or codeMessageChannelcode.p  pFor that reason, I inject the following implementations for codesetTimeoutcode and codesetImmediatecode p  precodeimplementation JSContext TimingPolyfills   voidinjectTimerPolyfills       self[setTimeout]  JSValue function, JSValue timeout          dispatchafterdispatchtimeDISPATCHTIMENOW, int64t[timeout toInt32]  NSECPERMSEC, dispatchgetmainqueue,              [function callWithArguments[]]                    self[setImmediate]  JSValue function          [function callWithArguments[]]         end codepre  pThis seems to work fine. However, the performance impact of dispatching to native and back to JS is huge. The following microbenchmark might not be supermeaningful, but it shows the costs of making a roundtrip to nativep  precode takes around 10.5s for 1.000.000 iterations [context evaluateScriptsetImmediatefunction ]  takes around 6.5s for 1.000.000 iterations [context evaluateScriptfunction ] codepre  pSo the big question is Are there any options to get codesetImmediatecodefunctionality in headless codeJSContextcodes which have a smaller footprint than dispatching to native and back to JSp

Negative 902 pI have a chat website using node js and angular, and I have made the loginsignup and chat page using these. but the problem is, whenever I load the chat page it uses the style from the other pages, and basically acts like a different section of the same page, It also merges the loginsignup together, which is ok, because they have the same style just different number of form boxes, I want to stop angular from merging the styles from the loginsignup with the chat and have it use its own style.  All help would be very much apreciated, thanks in advance.  And as far as I have been told and know, there is nothing in my own code that is preventing this, it is only angular itself. strongstrong textstrongBy the way, As far as I know, certain things the body of the different pages cant be individually styled, and If I were to merge htmls it would take a while and research and I dont really want to do so.p

Negative 902 pI am wondering if anyones ever tried tagging scenarios on the fly. p  pHeres the use case We have hundreds of scenarios for the regression tests, and some of the tests might fail because the API is down which usually means that the next time it runs, this should pass, or the data changed which means that either the scripts are not robust enough and we need to fix it, or we need to change the data, or the requirement changed which means that we need to change the scripts. p  pFor the latter 2 cases, the same scenario should fail multiple times. p  pWe need to tag the ones that require human intervention either rewrite the scripts or change data with quarantine, and take out the regression tag so that it wouldnt be run over and over while we know it would fail anyways. p  pIve not seen anyone does this. Is this doable Or is the only way to do this in Cucumber without resorting to complicated shell script p

Negative 902 pIve recently migrated a project from Maven to Gradle IE replaced the pom.xml file with a build.gradle file.  Since my company still has several downstream Maven projects that depend on it we must continue to publish a pom file along with class, source, and javadoc JARs to our Nexus repository so that the downstream projects can still consume this project as a Maven dependency.  This is what the mavenpublish plugin for Gradle is for.  Here is what my build.gradle file looks like with configurations for the mavenpublish pluginp  pre classlangjava prettyprintoverridecodeapply plugin java apply plugin mavenpublish  group  com.my.company version  myProductSNAPSHOT  repositories      mavenLocal     maven  url httpnexus.my.company.netnexuscontentrepositoriesbuildtestrelease      maven  url httpnexus.my.company.netnexuscontentrepositoriesbuildtestsnapshot      maven  url httpnexus.my.company.netnexuscontentrepositoriescentral      maven  url httpnexus.my.company.netnexuscontentrepositoriesthirdparty    dependencies       Stuff   sourceSets      main           Stuff        task sourcesJar type Jar      classifier  sources     from sourceSets.main.allJava   task javadocJar type Jar, dependsOn javadoc      classifier  javadoc     from javadoc.destinationDir   publishing      publications          mavenJarsMavenPublication                Classes             from components.java               Sources             artifactsourcesJar                  classifier  sources                            Javadoc             artifactjavadocJar                  classifier  javadoc                                repositories          maven              url httpnexus.my.company.netnexuscontentrepositoriesbuildtestsnapshot             credentials                  username user                 password password                             codepre  pThis generates a Gradle publish task that will generate the required pom.xml file as well as the class, source, and javadoc JARs.  Once thats completed it will publish the jars to the buildtestsnapshot Nexus repository.p  pThis works perfectly fine on my machine as well as our build servers and most of my coworkers boxes.  However, some coworkers have been complaining because the gradlew publish command note that a Gradle 2.4 wrapper has been included with the project is failing on them with errors like thesep  pre classlangtext prettyprintoverridecodeCUsersuserPerforceWORKSPACEprojectsrcmainjavacommycompanytestrandomizati onRandomHelper.java18 error unmappable character for encoding Cp1252     private static final String NONENGLISHCHARACTERS  1234567890    amp. codepre  pInterestingly enough, the gradlew build command which compiles the project using javac executes just fine on everyones machines.  Its the gradlew publish command which has problems on some machines either passing or failing on both Mac and Windows.p  pI cant tell what the key difference is here, but I suspect that the affected users have their Perforce clients misconfigured no P4CHARSET specified and have all of the project files synced to their machines with the default encoding.  Its not clear to me how to check what encoding Perforce used when syncing though, so this is just a theory.  As far as I understand, even if they fix their configurations theyll still need to wipe out their enlistments and download everything from the Perforce server again to get all of the files with the correct encoding utf16lebom.p  pRegardless of any Perforce issues the blame is falling back on me since Im the one that switched us over to Gradle in the first place.  If theres some way that I can configure the mavenpublish plugin to work around the issue then Id prefer to do that.  If javac can compile the nonstandard characters from these files into classes then theres no reason that the plugin cant read them and generate javadoc for them, right  Maybe it needs to be explicitly told what encoding to usep  pIve already tried playing around with the Dfile.encodingxUTF16LEBOM option in JAVAOPTS and GRADLEOPTS this made no difference.  Ive also found the following snippet used for specifying the encoding for Compile tasks in Gradlep  precodetasks.withTypeCompile      options.encoding  xUTF16LEBOM  codepre  pUnfortunately, this is for Compile tasks, and the project is already compiling successfully.  Im not sure what type of tasks the mavenpublish plugin is generating, so I dont know how to apply this approach for those tasks is this possible.p  pstrongWhat else can I try to make the Gradle mavenpublish plugin stop tripping over fileencodingsstrongp

Negative 902 pIm trying to create a RegExp object in JavaScript, but cant because of quoting limitations. Im searching a part of my HTML document that Ive converted into a string, codedataCellsTextcode, using the codeouterHTMLcode property.p  pSince its an HTML document, and I have a tendency to switch between codecode and codecode quotes at times, I figured I would check for both, hence the code[]code. But that code[]code is whats preventing me from doing this. I need to use the constructor, codenew RegExpcode, because I need to insert a variable into the expression, meaning that I have to surround the expression with codecode or codecode quotes, both of which are already taken.p  pGiven all this, what I need is a third quoting level. I know of code...code, but I figure that would interfere with the regex. I also know about codeampquotcode, but this is not XML or HTML, so that would not apply either.p  pThe following is the jumbled mess that my regex code has become the syntax highlighting will further illustrate my pointp  precodevar regexXSearch  new RegExpltdiv id[]ww[]sdatacellx  cellCoords.x  gt, g var regexXResults  regexXSearch.execdataCellsText codepre  pIs there any way out of this quotation avalanche As previously mentioned, a third type of quote would be what I need, but it looks like theres no such thing that will work in this context.p

Negative 902 pI have created some tabs that slide out upon hover with only CSS and HTML. I am running into some issues with the hover position and sensitivity. I know that I can somewhat combat the sensitivity with the transition speed, but it seems as though when I hover in a space that isnt on the tab, said tab will pop out. Specifically if I attempt to access the price filter or any of the categories in the sidebar. I would like to limit the action to only be invoked once my mouse has hovered over the actual tab.

Negative 902 pI have a lockfree multi producer, single consumer queue, based on a circular buffer. So far, it only has nonblocking codepushbackcode and codepopfrontcode calls. Now I want to add blocking versions of those calls, but I want to minimize the impact this has on the performance of code that uses the nonblocking versions  namely, it should not turn them into emlockbydefaultem calls.p  pE.g. the simplest version of a blocking pushback would look like thisp  precodevoid pushbackBlockingconst Tamp pkg      if pushbackpkg          uniquelockltmutexgt ulmux         while pushbackpkg              cvnotFull.waitul                codepre  pbut unfortunately this would also require to put the following block at the end of the nonblocking codepopfrontcodep  precode     stdlockguardltmutexgt lgmux     cvnotFull.notifyall  codepre  pWhile the codenotifycode alone has hardly any performance impact if no thread is waiting, the lock has. p  pstrongSo my question isstrongbr emHow can I using standard c14 if possible add blocking codepushbackcode and codepopfrontcode member functions to my queue without severely impeding the performance of the nonblocking counterparts read minimize system callsem At least as long as no thread is actually blocked  but ideally even then.p  hr  pFor reference, my current version looks similar to this I left out debug checks, data alignment and explicit memory orderingsp  precodetemplateltclass T, sizet Ngt class MPSCqueue      using INDEXTYPE  unsigned long     struct Idx          INDEXTYPE idx         INDEXTYPE versioncnt          enum class SlotState          EMPTY,         FILLED          struct Slot          Slot  default                        stdatomicltSlotStategt state SlotStateEMPTY         T data          struct Buffert          stdarrayltSlot, Ngt data          Buffert              data.fillSlot SlotStateEMPTY, T                   Slotamp operator[]Idx idx              return thisgtoperator[]idx.idx                  Slotamp operator[]INDEXTYPE idx              return data[idx]                                       Buffert buffer     stdatomicltIdxgt head     stdatomicltINDEXTYPEgt tail0      INDEXTYPE nextINDEXTYPE old  return old  1  N       Idx nextIdx old          old.idx  nextold.idx         old.versioncnt         return old      public          bool pushbackconst Tamp val          auto tHead  head.load         Idx wrtIdx         do              wrtIdx  nexttHead             if wrtIdx.idx  tail                  return false                       while head.compareexchangestrongtHead, wrtIdx          buffer[wrtIdx].data  val         buffer[wrtIdx].state  SlotStateFILLED         return true           bool popfrontTamp val                          auto rIdx  nexttail         if buffer[rIdx].state  SlotStateFILLED              return false                  val  buffer[rIdx].data         buffer[rIdx].state  SlotStateEMPTY         tail  rIdx         return true       codepre  hr  pstrongRelated questionsstrongp  pI asked a similar question specificly about optimizing the usage of codeconditionvariablenotifycode a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions32577466useconditionvariablenotifywithoutloackingmutexnoredirect1comment5301053032577466herea, but the question got closed as a supposedly duplicate of a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions2763714whydopthreadsconditionvariablefunctionsrequireamutex9920condition20variable20functions20require20a20mutexthis questiona.br I disagree, because that question was about why the mutex is needed for condition variables in general or rather its pthread equivalent  focusing on codeconditionvariablewaitcode  and not ifhow it can be avoided for the codenotifycode part.

The object is disposed, so I cannot read its codeStreamcode property Remember we disposed it after caching itp  pNow, one way to solve this, is to never dispose the cached entities.

Negative 902 pso I am trying to parallize my matrix in such a manner that the matrix rows are divided by the number of threads provided and they calculate the rows assigned to them. The kicker is that the size of the matrix will be decreased by every iteration.p  pSo within the main matrix, I will be doing calculations for a submatrix and dividing that matrix between threads.p  pTo make this easier to visualize, Ill provide some pseudo code.p  precodefor i  0 i lt matrixSize i       begin  matrixSize  inumOfThreads  threadNum  i      end  matrixSize  inumOfThreads  threadNum  1  i  1          forj  begin  j lt end j               get which row to calculate within the main matrix             for k  i  1 k lt nsize k                   calculations for the columns                             codepre  pThe issue is setting the values of the begin and end. Because the size of the matrix may be prime number, say 991, the first block of calculations will have to do an extra row.p

Negative 902 pI want to run selenium tests simultaneously. But there is a twist here, I dont want to run tests simultaneously on different browsersdifferent machines.p  pIn my case i am using selenium to configure my servers from GUI I am not intended to test anything. For example i use the following command p  precodejava cp ltclasspathgt seleniumserverstandalone2.44.0.jar Package.ClassName param1 param2 param3 codepre  pThe above command will start configuring one server using parameters param1,param2,param3. Simultaneously i want to start another server configuration with different parameters.p  pIf i run the above command once, configurations are good. If the run the above commandwith different parameters by opening 3 instances of putty and run them simultaneously, things are messing up.p  pI am using the default port 4444 for all the above processes. I thought it might have caused issue. So, i started selenium in three different ports. and run the above command on three different ports. still the result is messing up.p  pI am not sure if selenium grid will help, as i dont want to run tests simultaneously on different browsersdifferent machines which selenium grid is meant for.p  pPlease help, many thanks p

Negative 902 pI have a program that returns an error after Ive compiled it in g, then run it in a Unix environment. The error is that my program says Segmentation error before it can do anything. This error is occurring when I try to set a new nodes data pointer equal to something. I know this because when I test this code in Visual Studio when I try to  check codeifcurrgtdata  chcode with codecurrcode being a pointer, codedatacode being the codecharcode element that the list is made up of, and codechcode being the codecharcode passed into the codebool LinkedListfindchar chcode function, Visual Studio breaks stops at that line of code.
