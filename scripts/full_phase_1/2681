Positive 2681 pI am working on an asp.net mvc5 web application, which is available to public users no login is required . and i need to prevent the same user from submitting more than 5 contact us requests within an hour. so i need a way to differentiate if the Request i am receiving  is coming from the same user or not. so i found the  codeRequest.UserHostAddresscode , which will contain the user IP if i am not wrong the public IP. but my question is will this value be unique per user all over the world  or users might share this value  if the answer is that  users might share the  codeRequest.UserHostAddresscode , so which value will give me better way to authenticate the user   p
Positive 2681 pAlright I know there are bunch of ways to connect to a oracle 11g database. And I have seen lots of tutorials on this topic. My problem is that Im not the one that host the server, its unlikely to get the SID of the server and the database name from the people that hosted it. I only know the server IP address and ports and Im able to send and receive Httprequests to or from the server using my username and password. p  pIs there a possible way to get the information I needed for the connection stringp  pMy goal is to use odp.net.

Positive 2681 pI have a python application that needs to select a specific local source address for IPv6 connections but can use the any 0.0.0.0 for IPv4 connections.  But the application is using a host name in             codesocket.connecthost, portcode to allow codesocket.connectcode to do the address lookup from name.p  pSo how do I bind both the specific IPv6 source address and the IPv4 any address to the local socket given that I dont know before codesocket.connectcode is called whether an IPv4 address or an IPv6 address will result from the name lookupp  pRight now I am handling it with an exception on codesocket.EAIADDRFAMILYcode as suchp  precodetry     sock.bind2601a2a0a0aa1d00aeaaaaffaa6caaab,0     sock.connecthost, port except socket.gaierror, e     if e[0]  socket.EAIADDRFAMILY         sock.bind0.0.0.0,0         sock.connecthost, port codepre  pBut of course there is no guarantee that the codesocket.connectcode in the exception handler will resolve host to an IPv4 address just because a previous codesocket.connectcode did.p  pThere must be a better way.  I suspect its going to be that I have to implement the address lookup and selection myself and pass an address, not a name to codesocket.connectcode.  That way I will know when I am doing my local address binding whether codesocket.connectcode will be using IPv4 or IPv6.  But it seems silly for me to have to reimplement the name resolution and selection that codesocket.connectcode already does.p

Positive 2681 pI am writing a distributed programming framework and I have reached a wall on what it comes to templated object declaration and creation on client side.

Positive 2681 pI currently have a problem while working with Mina. I am able to create a NIOAcceptor and Connector and connect the client to the server. Upon session being created in the Server, it sends the handshake packet which in turn validates and sends back validation to the server to see if files are uptodate, etc. The server receives this validation and correctly deciphers the packet and sends the packet to the Client to display the game window. However, after this initial connection, I can no longer send packets to the server via the Client.

Negative 2681 pIm trying to integrate several components to build a custom reporting solution. One of these components is a templatebased report generator. It reads a template consisting on a RTF file with placeholders and perform the substitution. This works great, and generates an RTF report.p  pAlthough it can generate the results as a stream instead of a physical RTF file, it has a property meant to specify the full name for the template input file. This is Ok on desktop applications but when talking about a WCF Service I would like to avoid the need to have a physical file in the HD.p  pAll the templates are stored inside a database. The application reads it from there as a stream and then saves it to the HD as an RTF file.  Id like to know if it would be possible in c to cheat the report generator in such a way that I could specify a string consisting on a kind of virtual  or fictitious path and then the componet would open the template from a memory stream as it was a real physical path on disc.p  pAny help will be appreciated.p  pThanks in advance,p  pGonzalop

Negative 2681 pIve been having some issues with calling codebecomeFirstRespondercode on a codeUITextFieldcode contained with a view controller that is presented modally. I call this method in the modal view controllers codeviewDidLoadcode method so that the keyboard is immediately displayed. What I expected is for both the keyboard and the modal view controller to animate from up the bottom of the screen at the same time. However, what Im observing is the followingp  ol liThere is a 0.2 second UI lag between clicking the button that calls the codepresentModalViewControlleranimatedcode method on the parent view controller and when the child view controller begins to animate modally.li liThe keyboard is immediately presented with absolutely no animation as soon as the modal view controllers animation begins.li liOnce the modal view controllers animation is complete, everything else seems to operate smoothly.li liDismissing the modal view controller results in it being smoothly animated off screen along with the keyboard, coincidentally.li liClicking the button that presents the modal view controller any time after the first time results in the same pattern except that there is no 0.2 second UI lag.li ol  pIts as if the keyboards animation and the modal view controllers animation are both competing for some lowerlevel Core Animation resource at the same time, but I dont see why this should be happening. What further seems to corroborate this hunch is if I dont ask the codeUITextFieldcode to become the first responder i.e., if I dont ask the keyboard to present itself, then there is absolutely no UI lag, and the modal view controller animates instantly.p  pInterestingly, if I do something like code[self.textField performSelectorselectorbecomeFirstResponder withObjectnil afterDelay0.0001]code then the animation of the keyboard happens nearly at the same time as the modal view controllers animation  its extremely difficult to tell that they arent both being animated at the exact same time when running on the iPhone Simulator. However, when running on an actual device, its easily noticeable that the keyboard doesnt appear until after the modal view controller is presented. Importantly, though, theres no more UI lag.p  pHas anyone experienced anything similar to thisp

Negative 2681 pMy website makes extensive use of imagemaps. The images are of pages from a medieval manuscript. The mouseOver event of the AREA tags has a tooltip attached to it, which displays a modern typographic transcription of the ancient script for the line the mouse is hovering over. p  pI just checked my website out on the iPad at the Apple store. The iPad is in many respects a joy to use, however, I am wondering about Apples mapping of the mouseevents to the fingertouch events. Apple probably had a good reason for doing things as they did, but their choices seem counterintuitive and overly complicated to me. p  pSpecifically, the iPad Safari browser clearly was responding to both fingerDown and fingerTap, and in different ways. When I tapped an area of the imagemap, the tooltip wired to the mouseover event of the AREA tag was displayed, and remained visible until I tapped somewhere else. When I held my finger down on an area of the imagemap, the area changed color. So if iPad Safari detects a mouseOver eventhandler, it executes the mouseOver code on the clicktap and apparently prevents the click event from propagating, so that if you also have something wired to the click event, it doesnt work Is that rightp  pBut more importantly, why isnt fingerDown the iPadSafari counterpart for mouseOver FingerDown seems a more likely candidate than Tap when mapping the mouseOver event. I would have expected things to be mapped in this wayp  precode MouseClick  FingerTap i.e. finger down and then immediately up  MouseOver  FingerDown finger down and stays on the spot codepre  pIf Apple had treated fingerDown as the counterpart to mouseOver, then the tooltip could be displayed upon FingerDown and made invisible again on fingerUp, which would be the counterpart to mouseOut.p  pPerhaps someone could enlighten me about the thinking process that led Apple to these particular mousetotouch eventmappings Thanksp

However as I sometimes want to build the item name dynamically like codeitemicode, I need to have some surrounding method to access the variable.p  pI already tried codemodel.getitemicode, and codeparams.getitemicode, but model is null and params is an empty Map. I also tried pageScope, but though I can access an item via codepageScope.itemNamecode, I can not use codepageScope.getitemicode because pageScope is not a Map.p  pProbably there are multiple solutions to solve this Id be glad about an easy one . One solution I see is to pass myModel as the only parameter and then always use codemyModel.get...code, however this would mean that I had to change all my existing GSPs to always refer to myModel instead of accessing items with fixed names directly so if theres a way where I dont have to change the model passed to the GSP, this would be my favorite.p  pIf someone could also say a few words about the difference of model and params in this context, this would be additionally helpfulp

Negative 2681 pIm having a problem using RMagickImageMagick to open a file uploaded through a Rails form. I believe this is due to the fact that Rails Tempfile behavior is to eliminate the file extension. From what Ive read, ImageMagick should prefer to use magic number rather than file extension to detect the image file format, but that doesnt seem to be the case in my installation. Im doing thisp  precodeimg  MagickImage.readfullsizeimage.path codepre  pwhere fullsizeimage is the Tempfile object returned from the upload form controller, which creates an error like p  blockquote   pno decode delegate for this image format varfoldersuIuIsldaxoHkiXKWYFuTWs4TITmpRackMultipart20101031101441hiwlw0  errorconstitute.cReadImage532p blockquote  pThis is happening on Mac OS X 10.6 with Rails 2.3.8, RMagick 2.13.1 and ImageMagick 6.6.55. Ive confirmed that ImageMagick can convert the file Ive been using to test through the upload form successfully, and that the tempfile pathfile actually existsis readable.p  pI suspect that either a something in my ImageMagick installation is somehow preventing it from using magic number to detect the file type   getting ImageMagick working on Snow Leopard from source was an adventure itself or b there are just cases where this doesnt work and I somehow need to make Tempfile preserve the original file extension.p  pI know that I can get the original file name from the Tempfile object, but I havent found a way to rename the file. I suppose I could make some kludge where I use a File object and somehow create a copy of the Tempfile with the original extension on it, but that just seems unseemly. Whats the right way to solve this problemp  pThanks for your help.p

Negative 2681 pLets say I have three tables, [ONE], [ONETWO], and [TWO]. [ONETWO] is a manytomany join table with only [ONEID and [TWOID] columns. There are foreign keys set up to link [ONE] to [ONETWO] and [TWO] to [ONETWO]. The FKs use the ON DELETE CASCADE option so that if either a [ONE] or [TWO] record is deleted, the associated [ONETWO] records will be automatically deleted as well. p  pI want to have a trigger on the [TWO] table such that when a [TWO] record is deleted, it executes a stored procedure that takes a [ONEID] as a parameter, passing the [ONEID] values that were linked to the [TWOID] before the delete occurredp  precodeDECLARE Statement NVARCHARmax SET Statement   SELECT Statement  Statement  NEXEC [MyProc]   CAST[onetwo].[oneid] AS VARCHAR36    FROM deleted JOIN [onetwo] ON deleted.[twoid]  [onetwo].[twoid]  EXEC Statement codepre  pClearly, I need a BEFORE DELETE trigger, but there is no such thing in SQL Server 2005. I cant use an INSTEAD OF trigger because of the cascading FK. p  pI get the impression that if I use a FOR DELETE trigger, when I join [deleted] to [ONETWO] to find the list of [ONEID] values, the FK cascade will have already deleted the associated [ONETWO] records so I will never find any [ONEID] values. Is this true If so, how can I achieve my objective p  pIm thinking that Id need to change the FK joining [TWO] to [ONETWO] to not use cascades and to do the delete from [ONETWO] manually in the trigger just before I manually delete the [TWO] records.

Currently the app requires photos to be categorized in several ways before they are valid, hence users must upload photos one at a time and categorize them in order to save them to the database.p  pCategorization takes some time, so Id like to allow users to upload batches of photos and then come back and categorize them when they have time, but when photos are stored without being fully categorized I dont want them mixed in with complete photos.p  pId ideally like this to be a sort of Wizard system where users can upload a bunch of photos at once and then proceed through their personal queue and categorize each photo to finish creating it when they have time.p  pMy question is how would you approach a problem like thisp  pIve been thinking about using Single Table Inheritance to create two subclasses of Photo codeIncompletePhotocode and codeCompletePhotocode.

Negative 2681 pIs there any way to customize the map annotation bubbles in Appcelerator Titanium Specifically, Id like them to be able to display more text than what they show ideally, by expanding to fit the text.

Negative 2681 pUsing CakePHP Im getting multidimensional arrays and I cant seem to figure out why sometimes I can access them via key and sometimes I cant. For example I have an employee model with associated Plant information and find all correctly gets both sets of data and stores it in an array. The info is stored and accessed as codevar[Emp]code and codevar[Plant]code when I use codeEmpgtfindallcodep  pThis gives a nice keyed array, like thisp  precodeEmployee  Array     [Plant] gt Array             [0] gt Array                  [ID]... codepre  pHowever for some employees admins they arent associated with lists of plants, so instead of using their accociated plant data, I need to give them a list of all plants period, so I use codePlantgtfindallcode. The problem is the generated array is in a weird format as seen below p  precodeplants  Array     [0] gt Array             [Plant] gt Array                     [ID] gt... codepre  pSo I cant access codeplants[Plant]code, and I cant use the top level array as my codeEmployee[Plant]code array.

This xml file will have a list of employees where each emplyee have a reference to the Job chosen from the global xml file.p  pObviusly the program will have much more data, but this explains how it works.p  pIm still not sure if I must use a relational databse, what really frighten me in case I use one, is that I will have troubles in allowing the user to exportimport data if he install the program on a new computer. Also I would like to avoid to force the user to install a database on his computer well, an sqlitelike database could be ok because is on a file.p  pAny suggestion about this Thanks to everyonep

Negative 2681 pIm working with JPA Hibernate as provider and an underlying MySQL database.p  pI have a table containing every name of streets in Germany. Every streetname has a unique number. For one task I have to find out the number of the name. To do this I wrote a JPQLQuery like the following p  precodeSELECT s FROM Strassencode s WHERE s.name  name codepre  pUnfortunately there are streetnames in Germany which only differ in small and capital letters like Am kleinen Feld and Am Kleinen Feld. Obviously one of them is gramatical wrong, but as a name for a street, both spellings are allowed and both of them have a different number.p  pWhen I send my JPQLQuery to the database, Im usingp  precodequery.getSingleResult codepre  pbecause of the fact, that every streetname in the table is unique. But with the underlying MySQLDatabase, Ill get a codeNonUniqueResultExceptioncode, because a mySQL database is doing a case insensitive comparison by default. The common way to force mySQL is to write a query like p  precodeSELECT abc LIKE BINARY ABC codepre  pas discribed in chapter 11.5.1 in the mySQL Reference Manual, but there is no corresponding keyword in JPQL.p  pMy first attempt was to annotade the field codenamecode in the class withp  precodeColumnnullable  false, columnDefinition  varbinary128 codepre  pAnnotated like this, the database is automatically doing a case sensitive comparison, because one of the strings is binary. But when I use this solution, Im running into troubles when Im reading the names out of the databse, to write them into a file, because letters like , ,  are interpreted wrong then.p  pI know, that the field codenamecode should get a uniqueConstraint and its one of my goals to do so, but this is only possible if the database will do a case sensitive string comparison.p  pIs there a solution, where I can configure JPA to do case sensitive string comparison without having to manually finetune the databasep

Negative 2681 pIm having an issue with my progress bar. Now I have looked through all of the questions in overflow and Ive been through alot of google searching. I may have overlooked something, but Ill bet you anything this problem is something really simply I keep overlooking. Heres the deal.p  pMy progress bar seems to work just fine. Im using ajax, everything is in the right panel, it fires immediatly when the button is pushed and actually it stops once the process is completed although I have no idea how I did that. Please note, this is as simple as it gets. Its just a GIF, nothing special. Using Visual Studio 2010, SQL Server 2008, Ajax, and C. Im not using a jquery or js, although I may have too. p  pMy application is simple. It sends orders to a different server, so I am on the client side. Once the button is clicked, the orders are in the process of being sent. My Problem is, although the orders are being sent, when the progress bar stops, and the process is done, my labels success or error and order database tables do not fire. Why is this I find this very odd because the application sends the orders, it functions 100, but nothing changes on the user side. p  pHere is some code, if you need more then just say the word.

Negative 2681 pIn my application I have thee tabs in the ViewFlipper. When the activity is started I initialize all the tabs and the views inside of them.p  pBut the problem is at the 3th tab. On the initialization of this tab, I want to know the distance of an TextView to it parents left side. Therefor I call the TextView.getLeft.p  pBut when this tab isnt shown I receive 0 from this method. Therefor I can not initialize the view correctly.p  pNow it becomes strange When I start the activity to the first tab, then go to the third, the getLeft return 0 of startup and on tab click.... But when I start the activity to the third tab, the getLeft returns a valid value....p  pSo, how can I get the correct value  I guess the ViewFlipper doesnt have the correct X,Y coordinates of views when the tab isnt shown.p  pPs. It was hard to explain. If I need to clarify something, please let me know. p

The problem was in the XSLT. The tag which should have the value as bsicad2box actually has kalkulation. So there you go, I was under a time crunch so could not think out of the box. Thanks again for everyone.p  pRegards.p
Negative 2681 pIf I am the page admin of a page and an owner of an app, does that mean I automatically get managepage permission to the pages I administerp  pI basically am seeing that when I do meaccounts and pass my apptoken I get accesstokens for  all pages I manage. p
Negative 2681 pIm sitting here scratching my head with a validation problem in ASP MVC3.p  pSomehow Im able to validate the field Quantity, but the field OrderNumber does not validate. I can leave it empty and it still accepts it.

Negative 2681 pI am trying to extract all the images in a PDF and then convert them into DIB format. First part is easy. I extract all the contents in the PDF, then iterate through them and whenever I find a PDEImage, I put them in an array.p  pBut I am clueless about how to go about the second part. Looks like all the AVConversion methods allow you to convert a whole page of a PDF, not just images, into other formats.p  pIs there any way I can accomplish this task Thanks in advancep  pstrongEDIT Further elaborating the problem.strongp  pI am writing an Adobe Acrobat Plugin using Visual C with .NET Framework 4.p  pThe purpose of the plugin is to among other things extract image data from a PDF file, then convert those data to DIBs. The need to convert to DISs is because I then pass those DIBs to another library which do some image correction work on them.p  pNow my problem is with converting the said image data in PDFs to DIBs. The image data on PDFs are found in a format called PDEImage Ref Link where apparently it contains all the color data of the image. Now Im using the following code to extract the said image data bits from the image to be used with CreateCompatibleBitmap and SetBitmapBits to obtain a HBITMAP handle. Then, I pass that along with other necessary parameters to the GetDIBits to obtain a DIB in the form of a byte array as stated in the MSDN.p  precodevoid GetDIBImagePDEElement element      Obtaining a PDEImage     PDEImage image     memsetampimage, 0, sizeofPDEImage     image  PDEImageelement      Obtaining attributes such as width, height     of the image for later use     PDEImageAttrs attrs     memsetampattrs, 0, sizeofattrs     PDEImageGetAttrsimage, ampattrs, sizeofattrs      Obtainig image data from PDEImage to a byte array     ASInt32 len  PDEImageGetDataLenimage     byte data  byte malloclen     PDEImageGetDataimage, 0, data      Creating a DDB using said data     HDC hdc  CreateCompatibleDCNULL      HBITMAP hBmp  CreateCompatibleBitmaphdc, attrs.width, attrs.height       LONG bitsSet  SetBitmapBitshBmp, len, data  Here bitsSet gets a value of 59000 which is close to the images actual size      Buffer which GetDIBits will fill with DIB data     unsigned char buff  new unsigned char[len]      BITMAPINFO stucture to be passed to GetDIBits     BITMAPINFO bmpInfo     memsetampbmpInfo, 0, sizeofbmpInfo      bmpInfo.bmiHeader.biSize  sizeofBITMAPINFOHEADER     bmpInfo.bmiHeader.biWidth  LONGattrs.width     bmpInfo.bmiHeader.biHeight  LONGattrs.height     bmpInfo.bmiHeader.biPlanes  1     bmpInfo.bmiHeader.biBitCount  8     bmpInfo.bmiHeader.biCompression  BIRGB     bmpInfo.bmiHeader.biSizeImage  bmpInfo.bmiHeader.biWidth  bmpInfo.bmiHeader.biBitCount  31 amp 31 gtgt 3  bmpInfo.bmiHeader.biHeight       bmpInfo.bmiHeader.biXPelsPerMeter  0     bmpInfo.bmiHeader.biYPelsPerMeter  0     bmpInfo.bmiHeader.biClrUsed  0     bmpInfo.bmiHeader.biClrImportant  0      Callling GetDIBits     Here scanLines get a value of 0, while buff receives no data.     int scanLines  GetDIBitshdc, hBmp, 0, attrs.height, ampbuff, ampbmpInfo, DIBRGBCOLORS      ifscanLines gt 0              MessageBoxNULL, LSUCCESS, LMessage, MBOK          else              MessageBoxNULL, LFAIL, LMessage, MBOK       codepre  pHere are my questions  concerns.p  ol lipIs it correct the way Im using CreateCompatibleDC, CreateCompatibleBitmap and SetBitmapBits functions My thinking is that I use CreateCompatibleDC to obtain current DC, then create a DDB using CreateCompatibleBitmap and then set the actual data to the DDB using SetBitmapBits.

Negative 2681 pIm working on a project that generates a iOS static library, and some sample code describing how to use the library... The code for the library will not be made public, but the sample code obviously will be.  I also use the sample code as a simple test harness for the library, so during dev, I point it directly to the private source files, and test wo the library dependency.  The trouble is, I then have to manually make changes to the sample code project to get it ready for general consumption.  I would like an easy way to test changes to the library while in dev mode, then build and package the library along with the sample code now pointing to an actual .a file  headers into a releasable file hierarchy.  I know how to build everything in manual steps, my question is more to the point of how you set up your folderproject structure, as well as how to set up any build scripts to make the whole process automatic.

I know that typically you run web apps from the webapps directory which uses Tomcats default server configuration server.xml.

Negative 2681 pI use memcached to save about 5MB data.

Negative 2681 pIm using ASP.NET to send REST requests to a server I have no control of. One type of request is for a specific product. The product may be available in many different variations. Some of the variations could be Size, Color, Metal gold, silver, etc. In the case of some products there could be a Year variation and a Make Ford, Dodge, etc.. The point here is that the variations are many and sometimes there is only a single variation, while other times there may be 3 or 4 variations for a product.p  pAlso, there are not set lists of how many selections a variation might contain. For example, one product may be available in Pink, Green, Blue of a Color variation, while another product might only be available in Black or White. Size could sometimes contain 8, 10, 12 and 14 for a jewelry item, or Small, Medium, Large for a clothing item.p  pThe combination of variations for a product are always returned in the REST response. For example, Ill always know a products variation attributes like Color, Size, etc. Ive found that the cleanest way of presenting these variation options is by using DropDownLists. I can dynamically create a DropDownList of Color and populate it with options of Pink, Green and Red  or whatever.p  pA product with a Color of Pink and a Size of Small has a different product ID than one which is Pink and Large.p  pSo, if a web visitor looks up a product and then selects the desired variations, I need client side script logic that will associate a product ID based on the variations selected so the product can be added to his shopping cart.p  pThe REST response contains an array of product IDs that are associated with the combinations of variations.p  pIm sorry for such a lengthy explanation, but I dont have any code to present at this point. p  pWhat Im wanting to know is, since JavaScript doesnt support multidimensional arrays, what options do I have to use clientside Javascript logic to determine a product ID based on the selected values of one or more DropDownListsp  pOne the server side, either in my XSLT templates or in the ASP.NET codebehind, I can use Page.ClientScript.RegisterArrayDeclaration in some fashion, but I really need some logic thats ignorant to what the specific variation names are.p  pSo, for example, I have a product called WIDGET and it has the following variations layed out as ProductID, variation1, variation2p  precode00001, Black, Small 00002, Pink, Small 00003, Red, Small 00004, Black, Medium 00005, Pink, Medium 00006, Red, Medium 00007, Black, Large 00008, Pink, Large 00009, Red, Large codepre  pAnd I have 2 DropDownListsp  pColor Black, Pink, Redp  pand p  pSize Small, Medium, Largep  pHow would I determine the ProductID based on the selected Values of variation1 and variation2 Keep in mind these attributes are dynamically createdpopulated. The client Javascript needs to be generic. I probably need to create several arrays for the Javascript logic.p  pOne to pass the possible variationsp  precodePage.ClientScript.RegisterArrayDeclarationproductvariation, Color Page.ClientScript.RegisterArrayDeclarationproductvariation, Size codepre  pAnother, as above, to contain the ProductIDs and their associated variationsp  precodePage.ClientScript.RegisterArrayDeclarationproduct1ID, 00001 Page.ClientScript.RegisterArrayDeclarationproduct1Color, Black Page.ClientScript.RegisterArrayDeclarationproduct1Size, Small  Page.ClientScript.RegisterArrayDeclarationproduct2ID, 00002 Page.ClientScript.RegisterArrayDeclarationproduct2Color, Black Page.ClientScript.RegisterArrayDeclarationproduct2Size, Medium codepre  petc. etc. But to be honest, I do not know Javascript and I just dont know how to pull this off without seeing an example. Ive searched, but havent been able to find anything close. I could also create some hidden inputs in the asp page if it would help with the client side script.p  pCan anyone point me to an example that will help me with a solution to this Is there an easiermore suitable way of doing what I needp  pThank you for reading all of this. I almost didnt post it since its so lengthy...p  pstrongEDITstrongp  pThe ideas submitted by gilly3 below are right on with how I thought this should work. Again, I have very limited experience with Javascript of any flavor, but Ive followed the instructions as best as I can. Am having a problem someplace though, so I wanted to display my progress and ask if you see whats wrong.p  pIn Product.aspx I create a hidden field containing the variations of the product being viewedp  precodeltinput idhfdatalist typehidden value[ Id 00001,Color Tidal, Size 2, Id 00002,Color Tidal, Size 4, Id 00003,Color Tidal, Size 6,  Id 00004,Color Tidal, Size 8,  Id 00005,Color Tidal, Size 10,  Id 00006,Color Tidal, Size 12,  Id 00007,Color Tidal, Size 14,  Id 00008,Color Tidal, Size 16 ] gt codepre  pAnd a hidden field containing the variation attributes Color and Sizep  precodeltinput idhfpropctlmap typehidden value ddSize Size, ddColor Color gt codepre  pI have two dropdownlists. One for Size with an id of ddSize and another for Color with an id of ddColor. ddColor in this case has only one option, Tidal. ddSize has multiple options, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14 and 16. Clicking any option in either of these dropdowns will fire the following Javascript.p  pIn Product.aspx I include the Javascript example as provided by gilly3. I made some assumptions about where to put some of the code, but for the most part Ive used it verbatimp  precodelt Augment JS files gt ltscript typetextJavaScript src..Scriptsaugment.min.jsgtltscriptgt  lt Variations Support Script gt ltscript typetextJavaScriptgt     select.changefunction            var data  .parseJSON[idhfdatalist].val         var propertyControlMap  .parseJSON[idhfpropctlmap].val         var filteredData  data          var selections  select.mapfunction               return                  Property propertyControlMap[this.id],                 Value this.val                      .get          filteredData  data.filterfunction item              return selections.everyfunction selection                  return item[selection.Property]  selection.Value                               var selectedId  filteredData.length  1  filteredData[0].Id           [idSelectedVariationASIN].valselectedId       ltscriptgt codepre  pI realize this code is a little messy since I have some debugging assistance included. There are 2 alerts that display the contents of the hidden fields saved to variables test and test1. Both of these display the value of the hidden fields perfectly I think.p  pI set a breakpoint and view the contents of the data variable. There are 8 elements to the array 07 and each one of them contains correct Id, Color and Size values. The property names appear correctly and the actual data is valid.p  pSame with propertyControlMap. When I view its data, the Property names and values are correct. There are 2 elements 01.p  pOf course, filteredData is also correct since its just a copy of the data var at this point.p  pThe next var I look at is selections. Here is the first sign that something isnt quite right. After selections is assigned and I view its value, I can see there are 9 methods and 2 elements 01. Upon looking at the elements, selections[0].Property is undefined and its value is incorrect 1036682. I recognize the value from the value stored in another hidden field on the page called hfSearchIndex. I have no clue why this happens. This field isnt referenced in the script at all. It has nothing to do with this part of my program logic.p  pOdd though, selections[1].Property also contains undefined, though Value contains the actual value of whatever Size I clicked on in the ddSize dropdownlist. So, its partially correct.p  pFrom this point, the code is unpredictable and probably not worth commenting on, except to say that the last line of code, selectedId, returns .p  pgilly3 or anyone else, can you see what Ive done wrongp  pstrongEDIT 2strongp  pgilly3 mentioned that the propertyControlMap might not contain the correct IDs of the dropdownlist controls. Im not positive, but I think it does contain the correct IDs. However, there is a Master Page involved and also an aspPlaceHolder control. So the Name attribute does have some mangling going on.p  pHere are some factsp  ol lihfdatalist looks perfect as displayed above.li lihfpropctlmap looks perfect as displayed above.li livar data gets initialized correctly. Each element of the array contains perfect ID, Color and Size values as specified in the hfdatalist hidden field. ie 00001, Black, Small.li livar propertyControlMap gets initialized correctly. Each element of the array contains perfect ID of dropdownlists and the correct variation name. ie ddColor and Color.li liThe first indication of a problem is at codevar selections code in the Javascript. After this line of code is executed, codeselectionscode doesnt contain valid data. Instead of selections equal to ID00001, ColorBlack, SizeSmall it equals undefined1036682, ColorBlack, SizeSmall.

I do suspect, like gilly3, that there is something incorrect about the way Im referring to control IDs, though propertyControlMap does contain completely validcorrect data in all of its elementsproperties.p  pIf this is a problem with control IDs due to a Master Page and PlaceHolder, how do I get around this p  pNOTE The dropdownlist controls are created in an XSLT Transform using XSLT Stylesheets ran on the REST response received. The hidden fields are created in the page codebehind using a deserialized REST response.p  pThank you for helping me on this gilly3. Im really stuck due to my lack of knowing Javascript. I have to use Javascript to be crossbrowser compatible in this situation.

Right now, if i run it with a path named dir1 it treats it like dir1 relative instead of absolute.p  pThis is the main function, it calls the recursive function. pathname is the given path, buf will contain the real path.p  precodeint readlinkchar pathname, char buf, sizet bufsize     char name[DIRSIZ]     char realpathname[100]      memsetrealpathname,0,100     realpathname[0]        ifgetrealpathpathname, name, realpathname, 0, 0        memmovebuf, realpathname, strlenrealpathname        return strlenrealpathname           return 1   codepre  pThis is the recursive part. the function returns an inode structure which represents a file or directory in the system. it builds the real path inside realpath. ilock an iunlock are being used to use the inode safely.p  precodestruct inode getrealpathchar path, char name, char realpath, int position     struct inode ip, next     char buf[100]     char newpath[100]      ifpath           ip  igetROOTDEV, ROOTINO ip gets the root directory     else         ip  idupprocgtcwd  ip gets the current working directory      whilepath  skipelempath, name  0name will get the next directory in the path, path will get the rest of the directories         ilockip         ifipgttype  TDIRif ip is a directory             realpath[position1]  0             iunlockputip             return 0                   ifnext  dirlookupip, name, 0  0next will get the inode of the next directory             realpath[position1]  0             iunlockputip             return 0                  iunlockip          ilocknext          if nextgttype  TSYM if next is a symbolic link             readinext, buf, 0, nextgtsize buf contains the path inside the symbolic link which is a path             buf[nextgtsize]  0             iunlockputnext              next  getrealpathbuf, name, newpath, 0call it recursively might still be a symbolic link              ifnext  0                 realpath[position1]  0                 iputip                  return 0                           name  newpath             position  0                       else         iunlocknext          memmoverealpath  position, name, strlenname         position  strlenname         realpath[position]         realpath[position]  0          iputip          ip  next            realpath[position1]  0      return ip  codepre  pI have tried many ways to do it right but with no success.

Negative 2681 pIm running Python 2.7 on a Win32 OS, but im hoping to write platformindependent code. Im trying to use Python to interact in realtime with a Java program i wrote, and figured pipes would be the best way to do this. My Python script is calling Java as a subprocess. Essentially, Java is the GUI and Python is the back end. I dont want to use Jython or wxPython because i only want to be dependent upon the standard libraries each language provides. Trying to set up communication between the two has been terrible. I can send a message from the parent Python script to the child Java class usingp  precodeprocess.stdin.writemsg process.stdin.flush codepre  pbut reading Javas output has not worked. I usep  precodeprocess.stdout.read codepre  pbut apparently this blocks forever if theres nothing to read. And codeprocess.communicatecode is off limits because it doesnt do anything until the subprocess terminates. According to my research, a common method people use to get around this problem is to use threads although someone suggested appending a newline when writing  didnt work, but being new to Python and threading in general i have no idea how that would look. Ive tried looking over the standard librarys codesubprocess.pycode source but that hasnt helped. Is there a way to see if stdout is empty, at least If not, how do i accomplish thisp
Negative 2681 pProxy  what code and where translates ProxyService into RealService calls Whywhen use this Layers  how to implement Memento  why not just persist state to a cache or filep  pMy understanding of the strongProxystrong pattern is that you have some kind of codeServicecode interface that has codeProxyServicecode and codeRealServicecode concretions. For some reason, you cant access the codeRealServicecode, so you code against a codeProxyServicecode instance and then let the framework link the proxy to the real instance of your service. Only two problemsp  ul liI cant think of a single example when I would have access to codeServicecode and codeProxyServicecode, but not codeRealServicecode  can someone provide examples as to when this could happenli ul  pHow is this different from the strongMementostrong pattern My understanding of Mementos definition is that it is used for saving an object state, which is what a Proxy is really doing, yes If not please explain how Memento is different than Proxy Thanks in advancep

Negative 2681 pA common practice in C to implement Object Oriented is using an array of function pointers. This seems to be similar to the C vtable and in essence the C virtual functions mechanism is just syntactic sugar around an array of function pointers.br But the C mechanism has an additional feature which is missing in C. A function pointer can be NULL and the caller can check if the function is NULL to see if an object implements a certain method. In C however a method cannot be NULL and a class cannot not implement a method.p  pWhat is the closest way of mimicking this behavior in Cp

Negative 2681 pAlright Gents, p  pIm trying to search a vb.net combo box for an item. The combo box is already bound to dataset. The display member is set to display just a single column of the selected record. I had it set initially so the objects displayed in the combo were a customized class. In this class I specified all the properties I wanted to keep track of and that seemed to work well. However now that I am using the combo box in its bound state it is much more difficult to manipulate the data. p  pMission To have the user type a number, if the number is contained in the ComboBox, the combo box should then move to that record so that all the other items bound to that control will update as well. p  pResearch I have looked into the System.Windows.Forms.BingingManagerBase class and that seems to have the information I need. I just cant figure out the bridge between that and what Im trying to do. I want to throw something together so I tried to simply do a SQL search against the dataset for the text in the combobox. Unfortunately that requires late binding and my targeted version of the .Net compact framework does not support that. p  pHere is an example of the late binding I was attempting. Im working with VB.net 2005, Compact Framework 3.5 I believep  precodeFor i as integer  0 to combobox.items.count  1       dim Dsr as Dataset.Row       dim dv as dataview      Dsr  DirectCaseDv.row, Dataset.Row       If Dsri.DesiredColumn  DesiredRow.Desiredcolumn then      Do such and such code     End If   Next  codepre  pI want to be able to search the dataset for a specific record matching a query. After I find that row matching the query I want to be able to move my combo box to the row found in the SQL query. The main problem seems to be that the Combo works in Datarowviews and my datasets are mostly cast to rows pertaining to the DS. p  pAnyone have some insight on this it would be much appreciated. p  pThanks againp

Negative 2681 pSo Im building my app around facebook oauth, and was hoping to use the fbsr token to identify loggedin users so that the facebookjs stuff stays in sync with my site.p  pUnfortunately, it appears that these fbsr cookies are set to expire within a day. Which means if the user comes to my site a day later, they have no cookie and are shown a loggedout experience.p  pThe facebookjs then runs, recognizes them, creates the fbsr cookie, and gives me a callback. I can choose to do a hard page refresh rather jarring, or try to do fancy inplace ajax updating tons of complex code, still slightly jarring. Is there a reason these cookies dont have a longer expiration so the user stays loggedin seamlessly Most websites allow you to remember me when you log in to avoid constant cookie expirations, so Id rather not have my facebookenabled website keep logging me out.p  pIs there anything I can do about this I suspect I can probably switch to serversideoauth where I manage identity and cookie expiration myself yes. But it seems strange that clientsideoauth would have such a limitation, so Im hoping Im missing something.p

Negative 2681 pI have a series of classes that I am converting to XML using .NETs DataContractSerializer in .NET 4.0. The serialisation is working fine, and I can parse the XML and recreate the .NET objects later without any difficulty.p  pHowever, most of the DataMembers are not required. [DataMemberIsRequired  false]. This works great on deserializing the XML, where you can then just miss the XML node out of the document, but when serializing an exisiting object into XML, the DataContractSerializer insists on writing out properties that have null values as nodes with an attribute e.g. p  precode[DataContractName  response, Namespace  httpdomain.comname] public class MyResponseClass      [DataMemberName  count, IsRequired  true, Order  0]     public int Count  get set       [DataMemberName  info, IsRequired  false, Order  1]     public InfoClass Info  get set       [DataMemberName  metadata, IsRequired  false, Order  2]     public MetadataList Metadatas  get set    codepre  pcan be serialised fromp  precodeltresponse xmlnshttpdomain.comnamegt     ltcountgt4ltcountgt ltresponsegt codepre  pHowever, if I serialise the object, it createsp  precodeltresponse xmlnshttpdomain.comname xmlnsihttpwww.w3.org2001XmlSchemainstancegt     ltcountgt4ltcountgt     ltinfo iniltrue gt     ltmetadata iniltrue gt ltresponsegt codepre  pIs there any way to get the DataContractSerializer to not write the node instead, when it has a null valuep
Negative 2681 pIm working on a Python application that makes use of libupnp which is a C library. Im using CTypes to use the library which is easy enough. The problem Im having is when Im registering a callback function for read requests. The function has a prototype of the following formp  precodeint readcallbackvoid pFileHandle, char pBuf, long nBufLength codepre  ppFileHandle is just some file handle type. pBuf is a writable memory buffer. This is where the data is output. nBufLength is the number of bytes to read from the file. A status code is returned.p  pI have a Python function pointer for this. That was easy enough to make but when I define a Python function to handle this callback Ive found that pBuf doesnt get written to because Python strings are immutable and when you assign or modify them they create new instances. This poses a big problem because the C library expects the char pointer back when the function finishes with the requested file data. The buffer ends up being empty every time though because of the way Python strings are. Is there some way around this without modifying the C libraryp  pThe handler should modify the buffer parameter that is given which is my problem.p  pSo what I want to have happen is that the Python function gets called to perform a read of some file could be in memory, a file system handle, or anything in between. The pBuf parameter is populated by a read of the stream again in Python. The callback then returns to the C code with pBuf written to.p

Negative 2681 pIm just starting with PHP, so sorry if Im confusing.p  pI created my index page index.php by laying it out with HTML and Styling it with CSS.p  pI have a couple of questions that I would like to ask to get a basic idea of what I will need to look at or do.p  pSo on my home page index.php I have a signup and login form. Im not necessarily worried about the Sign Up form just yet, but more on the log in form. I also found a tutorial on how to do this, but it works a little differently than how I want it to work.p  pI need the user to log in and go to the control panel maybe control.php. Im guessing thats fairly simple. But if the user makes an error, I need the error message to display on the index page under the log in form. So do I need to create a separate page named login.php to set the action on the form, or should I set the action to index.php and just put the log in code on the home page.p  pAnother thing is a language changer. To start with, Im offering this website in French, Spanish, and of course English. I have a selection box that onchange runs a javascript function that changes all of the text using .InnerHTML to that certain language, but I want to make sure the user doesnt have to do that every time they come to the website. Im guessing you use a cookie for that. But how would I do this By using a form so I can on page load check to see what language and go to www.mysite.comindex.phpenglish.. Im completely new to this.. So basically, Im asking how would you do this Can I keep the Javascript function, or will I have to recode that to PHP the text changerp  pAny comments, answers, or suggestions are appreciatedp  pThanks Ryanp

Is there a way to get the callback to fire right away without being queued like this so that I get to run some code WHILE the window is being dragged and not when dragging stopsp

Negative 2681 pI have a MasterPage sectioned into a codeltdivgtcode tag for a Logo, Banner and a ASCX LogIn control, with the rest of the page in a codeltdivgtcode having the codeltaspContentPlaceHoldergtcode to host all my ASPX pages. The Login control is in an Update panel.p  hr  pstrongProblem strong  Some of the ASPX pages have an ASCX page with a input form with text boxes with Custom Validators. When I click on the LogIn button, the resulting postback also tries to post this input data and fails since the forms are blank with no data....and thus the codepostbackcode for the LogIn too does not go through. On other ASPX pages with no validations, the LogIn goes through.p  pI could solve this by having a separate page for Login...maybe with a ModalPopup etc  But isnt there any other way to tackle 2 buttons on the same page....one of which comes from the Master p

Negative 2681 pI know this question sounds familiar, but I have read so many of the similar questions and have not been able to find my specific situation.p  pI have a javascript object called gds GlobalDataStructure. As its name suggests, this object contains all the information I need for all the web pages of my project and is stored in localStorage hence why I am not just updating view model and need to map in the first place. It contains all sorts of feeds that are read via AJAX.p  pI use a constructor function to create gds. To massively simplify this structure and hopefully make this question simple, lets say gds wasp  precodefunction gdStructure     this.lastUpdate  new Date2010,1,1     this.family  new Object     this.series  new Object     this.product  new Object  codepre  pso I have p  precodegds new gdStructure codepre  pthen once i have populated the js array with data from initial feeds, I do the following.p  precode    viewmodel  ko.mapping.fromJSgds     ko.mapping.fromJSgds,viewmodel codepre  pThe view model is then bound to each page withp  precodeko.applyBindingsviewmodel codepre  pSo this all works no problem. This issue arises when I, for example, get a new family feed and I want to update that object. I can do the followingp  precodegds.familyfeed ko.mapping.fromJSgds,viewmodel codepre  pAnd all would work fine, but that is mapping a MASSIVE JS object every time. This is extremely slow so I need to find a way where I can update just the feed that has changed. ideally something like..p  precodeko.mapping.fromJSgds.family, viewmodel.family codepre  pBut this appears not to work. Also because it is an OBJECT I cant just do. p  precodeviewmodel.familygds.family codepre  pCan anybody help me I am sure this must be so simple.p  pThanks in anticipation.p

Negative 2681 pI am trying to make a scatter plot from some data with x, y, and z values.p  pMy code is the same as the example on the NVD3 website, a hrefhttpnvd3.orgghpagesscatter.html relnofollowhttpnvd3.orgghpagesscatter.htmla, except I also calculate a z value. Lets say z  x  y. Instead of changing the value of the radius, I would like to set the color by interpolating between two colors.p  pAll the points are displayed on the chart, but I can not figure out how to set the color for individual points, only for the series. For simplicity, I first tried setting the points to a static color like thisp  precode[keyX Plus Y,values[x0,y0,z0,colorff0000, ...] codepre  pbut this does not work, so I guess I need to do this in javascript. I took a look in scatterChart.js but didnt see an easy way. But I am in no way a javascript expert so I may have easily missed something.p  pAny advice on how to do this Do I need to learn how to create a new model filep  pI would also like to display the z value in a tool tip, but that will be step 2.p  pThanksp

Negative 2681 pIm a little confused about the .api file which gets created when using Google Cloud endpoints.  This seems to list all methods and parameters.  It gets auto generated using the Google Plugin for Eclipse or when running endpoints.sh.  The .api file seems to be needed, otherwise a 404 is returned when accessing the API.p  pIf I generate the endpoint class from an Entity class it creates the .api file AND the Endpoint.java file.  My question is if I want to create a custom Endpoint.java file e.g. different parameters, then how do I do this   Am I supposed to update my code then manually modify the .api file, or is there a way to generate just the .api file.p  pOr is Google App Engine saying you can generate the Endpoint with its basic methods and thats all that is possible...  I would have thought that the .api file should be generated based on registered endpoints in web.xml at deployment time or better still just scan for Api annotations at deployment time and build the necessary config then.p  pAlso if youre not using the plugin in Eclipse e.g. youre using Maven some further manual steps are required e.g. updating web.xml.  This is documented in the Generating Client Libraries section of the App Engine website  but this is surely doing more than generating a client library, its creating the necessary deployment config server side too.  I found this confusing.p

Negative 2681 pI need to implement a custom View object, which extends the TextView and  supports pinch zooming and scrolling of zoomed the text. Android documentation says that the TextView class can take care of its own scrolling without needing a ScrollView container, but I failed to implement this behavior. My custom TextView will have a fixed frame and usually the text which will be shown in it will be vertically larger than the frame. If we pinchzoom to the text, the text will be larger horizontally as well. Most of the examples I found were using a TextView inside of a ScrollView, but I specifically want to do this only with my TextView extending class, if it is possible.p  pThanks in advancep
Negative 2681 pCurrently I am working with the programmers and UX at my company to create a PatternComponent Library for use in our software. Think of it as our own version of something like Twitter Bootstrap, jQuery UI, or Yahoo Design pattern library. p  pI will be creating this library using HTML5, CSS3, and jQuery possibly with CoffeeScript. Should I be using a library like Jasmine to be testing my js The reason I ask is because any components that use jQuery wont really be doing much more than fancy effects. So, I guess, is it worth it to test things like, Does this button change class on hover or Does my accordion menu work correctly p  pI am unfamiliar with testing practices for simple frontend code, so I wanted some advice.p

And using codesomething  someFunccode assigns the function directly not its result to that variable And its mostly used to assign functions to events. e.g. I can assign a function to a onclick event.p  pBut what I dont understand is what happens when using either in some html element inline event, as in the examples, since the assignation is not to a javascript variable, but to an html attribute, which happens to be an event Please explain.p  pAnd also, is there a difference on assigning a inline onclick function to an anchor codeacode that to other elements e.g. codespan div labelcode etc Do they have the same effect p  pSidenote Ive been reading a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions134845hrefattributeforjavascriptlinksorjavascriptvoid0herea about how to run a function when clicking on a link, and I already understood is that is should emnotem be done inline, but instead using unobtrusive javascript.

Negative 2681 pFor example, I have a block of text which contains several instances of the string imagefilename.jpg where filename.jpg can be any filename, and I want to replace everything within the s with an image tag where the image is found by using the filename, e.g. Model.findbyattachmentfilenamefilename.jpg.p  pIs it possible to do thisp  pEditp  pExample inputp  precodeLorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipisicing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua.   imagesomefile.png  Ut enim ad minim veniam, quis nostrud exercitation ullamco laboris nisi ut aliquip ex ea commodo consequat. codepre  pDesired outputp  precodeLorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipisicing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua.   ltimg srcsystemattachmentsmodelsomefile.pnggt  Ut enim ad minim veniam, quis nostrud exercitation ullamco laboris nisi ut aliquip ex ea commodo consequat. codepre  pThe desired outputs image tags src attribute would be found by using codeModel.findbymodelattachmentfilenamesomefile.png.modelattachment.urlcodep  pThat is, something likep  precodestring.gsubimage., ltimage srcContentAttachment.findbycontentimagefilename[].contentimage.urlmain codepre  pwhere [] is replaced by a reference to what was replaced with gsub.p  pOr, how do I reference the first argument within the second argument of gsubp
Negative 2681 pFor example, I have an abstract class with a virtual methodp  precodeclass A  public     virtual void setColumnint i, string s  set column i to show string s     ...  codepre  pThe class is derived by some other abstract classes like codeBcode and codeCcode.p  pI find for most of objects of A follow the rule it has 2 columns name and description. To avoid repeating code the real case is more complex, so Id like to avoid the repeat, I add 2 more virtual methods in codeAcode because concretes classes have different implementations for codesetNamecode and codesetDescriptioncode.p  precodeclass A  public     virtual void setColumnint i, string s              if i  0             return setNames          if i  1             return setDescriptions           virtual void setNamestring s      virtual void setDescriptionstring s      ...  codepre  pThus, users just need to reimplement codesetNamecode and codesetDescriptioncode if the concrete class follow the rule. If not, they need to reimplement codesetColumncode. However, the 3 virtuals codesetNamecode and codesetDescriptioncode implement codesetColumncode make me feel the design has some problem. Any good design for itp

Negative 2681 pWhat does codeCoCreateGuidcode in ole32.dll used by codeGuid.NewGuidcode in .NET use to get entropy for its psudorandom number generatorp  pAt a guess I suspect it uses coderandcode or coderandscode but it may use codeCryptGenRandomcode to get higher entropy.p  pWhat I am mainly wondering do virtual machines running on the same physical machine share any of this entropyp  pI know that RFC4122 doesnt state that guids need to be truly random only unique, are there any elements of this entropy implementation that could be easily obtained and used to determine guids in the futurep  pIm mostly interested if running an application on multiple virtual machines that are hosted on the same physical machine will be more incline to generate guid collisions.p  pFor the most part we can assume we are dealing with v4 guids and not v1 which contain the mac address as part of their generationp

Negative 2681 pUsers of our platform will have large amounts of stored data on our system.

Negative 2681 pWe have a need to refactor a code base.

Negative 2681 pI recently integrated codefastclick.jscode into my project to eliminate the 300ms delay when physically tapping one of the links on a touchscreen device. Now Id like to test it to make sure that its integrated properly. If this is properly integrated I should be able to benchmark the 300ms speed difference.p  pAccording to Google...mobile browsers will wait approximately 300ms from the time that you tap the button to fire the click event. The reason for this is that the browser is waiting to see if you are actually performing a double tap.p  pIm having difficulty thinking up the logic I can use to benchmark this, however...p  pThe issue is that if I bind this to the link clicking event and set codevar startTime  new Datecode there, it will only run the benchmarks after the link is registered after the 300ms, and I wont be able to get an accurate benchmark that way.p  pAny ideas on how I can benchmark the difference and test that codefastclick.jscode is properly integrated into my projectp  pI can try starting the timer at the codemouseovercode event, but is there a better alternative to thatp  pa hrefhttpsgithub.comftlabsfastclick relnofollowHeres the link to the fastclick.js repository on GitHubap

Negative 2681 pCurrently i am experiencing a problem with AS3.p  pI was trying to draw a very long image which its size exceeds the range of the stage. The problem is that the part that exceeds the range of the stage will still be drawn so when I test my program using flash or on webpage the result doesnt look very good.p  pI set the stage size to 960 by 640, but the parts that beyond 960 and 640 or even xlt 0 ylt0  are still drawn.p  pIs there a way to hide the parts that are out of the range and only draw things within the range of the predefined stage p  pFrom my understanding the stage width and height should be the only viewable range but I dont know why things out of this range can still be seen.p  pBtw I am using FlashDevelop.p  pThanks very much.p

Negative 2681 pAs a bit of a learning exercise, Im writing a security app that, when an arbitrary event happens, needs to turn the camera on, take a picture, and turn the camera off, without worrying about flash, focus, or displaying a preview. I followed along the online demos and made a working app that takes a picture, but it uses previews and all that. So I started working on getting it to work without a preview. Anyway, I keep getting takePicture failed exceptions, and I have no earthly idea why. I was hoping someone with more experience with the Camera API could take a look and point me in the direction of a solution. Below are my pertinent files.

Negative 2681 pI am trying to CHMOD 777 all .doc files on my Mac.  Is there is a way through Terminal that I could do thisp  pp  pThanks for the responses.  I thought this was the way to change permissions on Word doc files.  I have 2 users on Mac make that share a folder.  But when one creates a doc file the other just has read permissions. I want both of them to have this, or everyone.  It doesntmatter. I also want to go back and retroactively make all the past docs, some of which user A has readampwrite permissions, and some of which user B has readampwrite permissions for, readampwriteable by both of them. Is there another way to do this  From what I can tell, this is a Mac permissions issue, nothing in Word. I thought CHMOD 777 in terminal was the way to do this.p
Negative 2681 pI have a postgres query written for the Spree Commerce store that sorts all of its products in the following order In stock then first available, Backorder then first available, Sold out then first available. p  pIn order to chain it with rails scopes I had to put it in the order by clause as opposed to anywhere else.

Negative 2681 pI am pulling data from a codeMySQLcode Server using an codeODBCcode connection to the codeMySQLcode tables. Unfortunately, the table names are now being appended to the variables, which means I have to run an extra step after the data pull to rename every variable for use. Why is this happening and how can I prevent this p  pE.G., MySQL table Sched has the following variables codeMAPID, TEST, TYPE, APPOINTcode, etc. but when I pull the data they come down as codeSchedMAPID, SchedTEST, SchedTYPE, SchedAPPOINTcode, etc.p  pI am using SAS 9.3 64b and setting a lib ref that includes the libname MySQLLib, type of connection odbc, the codeDSNcode, username and password. The connection obviously tests fine or I wouldnt be able to see the data, much less pull it. Basically, I set the data using the followingp  precodelibname MySQLLib odbc dsnMySQLSSH userampMySQLID pwdampsqlpwd  Data MySQLSched  Set MySQLLib.Sched  run  codepre  pGenerally, a local SAS table MySQLSched is created that I can then manipulate and use as I need, without further touching the original Sched table. I still can, but every variable has the table name appended.p  pI am not sure if this is a SAS issue or a codeMySQLcode issue. I will also ask this same question in the SAS forums. IF I receive a pertinent answer there, I will update this post with that answer.p  pAny ideasp

Negative 2681 pI have a TreeView which holds approximately 100,000 TreeNodes or even more, I have optimized everything related to loading or unloading them on deserialization process but now Im stuck with an issue I cant overcome. p  pIts important to mention I decided not to use the LabelEdit default event given by the control since its pretty tricky to make it work as I wanted to, Its widely known that there are a lot of problems with this particular event which have pushed many devs to implement their own custom TreeViews. p  pIn my case I am using a ContextMenu which has a Rename option, this brings a textbox right in front of the TreeNode and then I just simply change the TreeNode.Text property to whatever the user input was in the TextBox keydown event, once we trigger this event, the whole GUI freezes for a couple of seconds 45, Im not doing any Depth search over the TreeNodeCollection or anything, I am directly accessing the TreeNode and modifying the property... p  pSo, any thoughts on what could be wrong here I already tried BeginUpdate  SuspendLayout  or even a custom solution found here a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions487661howdoisuspendpaintingforacontrolanditschildrenHow do I suspend painting for a control and its childrena and nothing seems to help.p

Negative 2681 pI am writing a simple clientserver program in python. In the client program, I am creating two threads using Pythons threading module, one for receiving, one for sending. The receiving thread continuously receives strings from the server side while the sending thread continuously listens to the user input using rawinput and send it to the server side. The two threads communicate using a Queue which is natively synchronized, LIKE.p  pThe basic logic is like followingp  pReceiving threadp  precodeglobal queue  Queue.Queue0  def runself     while 1         receive a string from the server side         if the string is QUIT signal             sys.exit         else             put it into the global queue codepre  pSending threadp  precodedef runself     while 1         str  rawinput         send str to the server side         fetch an element from the global queue         deal with the element codepre  pAs you can see, in the receiving thread, I have a if condition to test whether the server has sent a QUIT signal to the client. If it has, then I want the whole program to stop. p  pThe problem here is that for most of its time, the sending thread is blocked by rawinput and waiting for the user input. When it is blocked, calling sys.exit from the other thread receiving thread will not terminate the sending thread immediately. The sending thread has to wait for the user to type something and hit the enter button. p  pCould anybody inspire me how to get around with this I do not mind using alternatives of rawinput. Actually I do not even mind changing the whole structure.p  pEDITp  pI am running this on a linux machine, and my Python version is 2.7.5p
Negative 2681 pI have 5 scheduled tasks that are scheduled to run every day at 9.30am. The schedule is basically a vbs script that opens an excel workbook and runs a macro.

Negative 2681 pIm trying to better understand the potential of AWS Secure Token Service, and looking for thoughts on how best to solve a particular problem.p  pLets say I have a bunch of IAM users that are currently fairly well carved up into different groups that restrict access to the AWS services that are needed admins, dbas, datawarehouse, etc.. However, even with this setup, there are still a bunch of longlived keys that will inevitably end up hard coded into various utils, committed to version control for all to see, etc. You can manually rotate all of these keys, of course, but thats a lot of effort.p  pSo, it seemed to me that a better solution was to adopt a stance of keys on demand. The IAM user accounts remain intact, and associated with the groups that grant them whatever access comes with that group, but without active API keys, the accounts are useless. I started writing a python app that first authenticates users against LDAP internally, and then allows them to click a button to generate a new API key for their AWS account. Then, I would run a cron job every minute or hour or whatever, to find keys that are older than 12 hours, send an API call to AWS to delete that key.p  pI got about 80 done with that, and stumbled on STS. Is my scenario a perfect usecase for STS Could I just create roles that mirror the various permission sets I need, and allow IAM users to have default stance of no access, but assume a role on demandp  pAnything else I need to be considering I.e. anything that might break by implementing something along these linesp

Negative 2681 pI cant figure this out, I hope someone here can point me in the right direction. Ive searched for an answer but was unable to find it. p  pI want to create a Facebook app which would manage ads download ads reports and statistics. Ive got user account, registered as developer, created and whitelisted the app. Ive got only Development Access and that means means I can query only ad accounts owned by the admins of the app, set up in the account list associated with your application.p  pProblem is that the account with ads is a business account so I cant add this account as part of developers team and get the statistics. I get permissions errors when trying to access the business account I have access token and everything, it just wont let me see the ads data due to insufficient permissions. p  pIs there a way to do this without applying for Basic access not sure if Ill get it since the app is not done Cant I really somehow connect my developers account with that business account p  pAbout access limits a hrefhttpsdevelopers.facebook.comdocsreferenceadsapiaccessv2.2limits relnofollowhttpsdevelopers.facebook.comdocsreferenceadsapiaccessv2.2limitsap

Negative 2681 pIm planning to program a reusable framework that manages its own views. To get started, I already managed to get the static library and a separate bundle assets etc working fine.p  pWhat Im trying to do now is somewhat comparable to the behavior of a jQuery plugin. The main application that depends on my framework and bundle should define an element in its view that it can hand over to my framework as a reference. The framework will then render itself within this element.p  pIt is necessary that the main application can handle itself how that container is being displayed overlaying the main app entirely, or being displayed in only a certain portion of the main app...p  pI was already looking at Container Views but am not sure if this is the suggested approach to accomplish this. Any ideas, or resources  tutorials that could point me in the right directionp

And it has to be on Windows. It has to be something, possible to do with one simple bat file, very fast, good quality,small size, just like original mp4 only with subs hardcoded. Thanks.p

I have forwarded port 80 to my pc ip 192.168.1.111, static and disabled all the firewalls see images. When i turn on WAMP, and enter localhost or 127.0.0.1 or 192.168.1.111 or even my wan ip 93.103.90.XXX everything connects and I get my test html page but when I enter my wan ip on any machine that is not connected to my router the page doesnt load  i dont even get 403 forbidden and yes my wamp says server online an i have edited the httpd.conf. Also a hrefhttpwww.yougetsignal.comtoolsopenports relnofollowhttpwww.yougetsignal.comtoolsopenportsa and a hrefhttpwww.whatsmyip.orgportscanner relnofollowhttpwww.whatsmyip.orgportscannera say port 80 is closedtimed out. Everything worked fine a week ago and i could access my server from anywhere with my public ip. I also tried other ports but i get the same thing, tried WAMP 2.4 with no success. All i did from last week was downgrade from Ultimate to Home Premium and install the drivers of course but I guess that has no effect and upgraded my router firmware linked above. Any idea why it doesnt work Does anyone have the older firmware, so I can try downgrading to itbr br Thank you for reading, David O img srchttpi.stack.imgur.com2j0zS.png altwindows firewallimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.commflsq.png altport forwardingimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comV3dRF.png altrouter firewallp

Negative 2681 pIm using the same class for two different tasks, when Im using it for the primary task everything works fine. But when I add the parameter ExportDestination  which is newworksheet.rangeA1  when running my class, Excel does not loop through all pivottables but loops the first one every time. p  pThe number of loops is correct  confirmed by Debug.Print wSheetSource.PivotTables.Count  3 , but the loop is stuck at the first pivottable created. Also, when adding the new chart it does not create an empty chart, but rather a copy of the previous chart  from the previous loop   can be seen by stepping through the code. p  pAll this does not happen when the parameter ExportDestination is omitted, but I cant find a way in which way the parameter would corrupt the procedure. p  pIn short, all the pivottables are correctly produced, and so are three corresponding charts, but all chart sourcedata are linked to the first pivottable created... Its especially fishy where the .AddChart2 method doesnt create a new blank chart but rather makes a copy of the previous loops chart, which it should not do. p  pThe issues relate to the CreateCharts

Negative 2681 pTo start off, heres a bit of info on what Im trying to accomplish, so if theres a better way of doing it, Id love to hear your thoughts.p  pIm creating and Android Kiosk application that leverages Lync UCWA to sit at the entrance of my work and when visitors enter the office, theyll use the Kiosk to notify somebody in the office that there is a guest.p  pIve had a new Lync user created for this purpose, which will be the account authenticated on the kiosk and will be the user sending outgoing messaging invitations.p  pWhat I want to accomplish is to create a group conversation by adding multiple people to a conversation so that everybody gets the message and somebody can then respond to the group chat letting everybody else know that they will go to the front and greet the guest.  Im able to send a message to a single person, but havent figured out how to get multiple people on a conversation.p  pIve tried to start a conversation with a single person and then call the strongaddParticipantstrong endpoint to add others to the conversation, but that hasnt worked for me yet.  From what Im seeing, I cant add somebody until the 1st person accepts the invitation, which poses the problem as I cant be guaranteed that person will accept it.p  pAm I taking a wrong approach here or am I missing something  I tried to think what code would be helpful here, but didnt think it would help, so if I see that its needed by followups, Ill post anything relevant to the topic.p

Negative 2681 pSo I have a data frame of 16 columns and 17 million rows.p  pI would first like to do some codeddplycode on the data frame and then look at the correlations between the different columns.

Negative 2681 pI need to retrieve a huge picture from a server but the server cant do that because the image is too big. I can give coordinates so that I can retrieve small parts of that picture. So I split the picture in to 100 tiles and than append 10 tiles to a row and than I append each row. That works well when I do it sequentially. Right now I download 10 tiles  append them to a row  download next 10 tiles  append them to a row  append the second row to the first one  download next 10 tiles etc.simplifiedp  precodepublic static void downloadWholeImage    int xcoord0    int ycoord0    outer loop for each row    forint i  0 ilt10 i       all tiles of a row are stored here       BufferedImage[] tilesForRow  new BufferedImage[10]       inner loop for each tile of a row       forint j  0 jlt10 j          downloads the image          BufferedImage tile  downloadImagexcoord,ycoord          removes all black pixels of the image          BufferedImage[j]  removeBlackColortile          increments xcoord so the next tile          xcoord              each row gets appended on top of the first row       ifi0          BufferedImage firstRow  appendTilesToRowtilesForRow        else          BufferedImage actualRow  appendTilesToRowtilesForRow               firstRow  appendActualToFirstfirstRow, actualRow        incrementing ycoord for next tile       ycoord        writeImagepath,firstRow  codepre  pBut since the rows are really big it takes very long to append them to each other. While they are being appended, I thought that I could create a thred that downloads the other tiles. And here is the problem. I am not used to program concurrently. I know how it is done technically implement Runnable etc. but how should I design it I had the Idea to run codedownloadImagexcoord, ycoordcode in another thread but that leads to the question where to put the coderemoveBlackColortilecode . Also in the thread or after the thread is finished.. And who should wait for what with join  I hope it was not that confusing. Please let me know if you need more clarification somewhere.p
Negative 2681 pI ask for your kind expertise on this issue.p  pBasically I need to combine two datasets, on matching fields, however, where there is no matching record in table1 against table2, the output table must include a value in a vote field to indicate it has not been missed off with a value of 0.p  pThe scenario this applies to, is a voting system.  Three tables ELECTIONS, CANDIDATES and VOTES.p  pThe final output table must output all the positions in the ELECTIONS table where there is a CANDIDATE.  However, there may not be any votes in the VOTES table for them for all the candidates for a position.  The output still must return the position, and a 0 against the VOTE.

Negative 2681 pI need to limit the number of orchestration instances spawned while debatching a large message in a streaming disassemble receive pipeline. Lets say that I have a large xml coming in that contains 100 000 separate Order message. The receive pipeline would then debatch it and create 100 000 ProcessOrder orchestrations. This is too much and I need to limit that. p  h2Requirementsh2  ol liThe debatching needs to be done in a streaming manner so that I only load one Order message in memory at a time before sending it to the messageboxli liThe debatching needs to be throttled based on the number of current running ProcessOrder orchestration instances say if I already have 100 running instances, the debatching would wait till one is over to send another Order message to the messagebox.li ol  h2Where Im ath2  ol lipI have the receive pipeline that does the debatching and functional modifications to my messages. It does what it should in a streaming manner and puts individual messages in VirtualStreamspli lipI have an orchestration and helper methods that can limit the number of ProcessOrder orchestration instances.pli ol  h2The problemh2  pI know that I can run a receive pipeline inside an orchestration and that would solve my problem since on every getnext call to the pipeline, I could just hold on if there are too many running orchestration instances strongbutstrong, digging in biztalk dlls, I noticed that using Microsoft.XLANGs.Pipeline.XLANGPipelineManager still loads up all the messages in memory instead of enumerating them like Microsoft.BizTalk.PipelineOM.PipelineManager does. I know they are putting every messages in VirtualStream but this is still inadequate, memory wise, for such a large message number.p  h2Questionh2  pMy next step would be to run the receive pipeline directly in the receive port so it would use Microsoft.BizTalk.PipelineOM.PipelineManager without having the orchestration that limits the number of ProcessOrder instances, but to meet the requirements, I would need to add a delay logic in my pipeline. Is this a viable option If not, why and what other alternative do I havep

Negative 2681 pIm working on a iOS kiosk type application that is utilizing Air Print to print a 10ish page document.p  pThis document is taking a very long time to print more than 1 minute and people are walking away before the print job is finished because they think its done. Its also printing the first two pages, waiting about 20 seconds, and then printing a few more. This is when people are walking away.p  pAs a test, I printed a longer and very image intensive document from a windows machine, to the same printer and on the same wireless network. This took less than 20 seconds, so its not the printer. Also, the wifi network for testing this is very strong, and both the printer and iPad are near the wireless router.p  pI made sure the print document is in Grayscale, and tried everything I can to slim down the document, but it always takes the same amount of time to print.p  pFor creating the print job, I have a custom class to create the print document, which takes no time at all to create.p  pBelow is the code that is actually connecting to the printer and sending the job. The only thing funky is that I am storing the printer instance globally so that the customer doesnt have to select a printer for each print job. p  pThis does all work, its just too slow.

Negative 2681 pI have a situation with an application I am building for a KIOSK in a public setting.  p  pThe application authenticates to website A with OAUTH.  Website A has the option to login, create account, or social login via OAUTH to FB, Twitter, LI.  p  pIf the user selects to OAUTH a second time to LI, FB or TW, each of those 3 websites set cookies and persist the login.  p  pOnce this OAUTH is completed, it redirects via callback back to my application.   This all works flawlessly with one Major exception.  The social logins cookies persist.p  pThe next person to login, if they also select OAUTH the second time, it will automatically login with the previous users information.  this is the same for all 3 social sites.p  pIf I block cookies, the logins wont work.  I tried to log the users out by setting iframes to the logout url for each of the sites, this didnt work, as their logouts require CSRF.p  pI tried changing browser settings as this is an isolated environment with no luck.p  pThe only work around I can see is to set a few iframes with the site, using javascript click the logout links on those pages.p  pIm also exploring using each of the social platforms javascript sdks, but havent had a chance to test that yet... p  pAny recommendations or help would be amazing  p  pTHANKSp

Negative 2681 pim recently having a big issue with uploading an image as an attachment to a strongcouchDBServerstrong. Ive implemented a function, that can upload an image to the server, coming from a codeHTMLinputTagcode, which is a fileObject. It works.

Negative 2681 pIve inherited a MVC project that seems to use Telerik Open Access to handle data instead of using something Im more familiar with like entity framework.  Im trying to understand the whole concept of how to work with this data method, but right now Im just needing to find out how to add a table.  Ive limited my code examples to one table, but in reality there are dozens of them.p  pSo I see that the class OpenAccessContext.cs has a database connection string, but it also has a IQueryable item made up of the class tblMaterial.  The tblMaterial class is defined in tblMaterial.cs.  I dont understand how this class is connected to the SQL database version of tblMaterial so feel free to educate me on that.p  pI have a table called tblContacts in the SQL database.  What do I need to do to connect it to my project  Theres no update from database option when I right click any object in the solution because theyre all just classes.  Will I need to create a new class manually called tblContacts.cs  If so, how do I connect it to the database version of tblContacts  Am I going to need to manually change multiple classes to add the table OpenAccessContext, MetadataSources, Repository, etc.p  pI tried to keep this as one simple question how do I add a table so I dont get dinged, but any light you can shine on the Telerik Open Access would be helpful.  Please dont ding me for asking that  I checked out the Telerik documentation here a hrefhttpdocs.telerik.comdataaccessdevelopersguidecodeonlymappinggettingstartedfluentmappinggettingstartedfluentmappingapi relnofollowhttpdocs.telerik.comdataaccessdevelopersguidecodeonlymappinggettingstartedfluentmappinggettingstartedfluentmappingapia , but its related to setting up a new open access solution.

Negative 2681 pOk.  Bare with me please as this is a doozy.p  pSo I have a strange issue.  I am building an app that pulls files from SharePoint 2013 or SharePoint 2010 for view in HTML.  In C, files are pulled out of SharePoint multipage documents like Word, Excel, PDF, TIFF, etc, then are fed into various 3rd party software DataLogics and Aspose  which break the documents down into their individual pages, then streams the individual pages to the browser in PNG format.  p  pSo in HTML, we have an img element whose src is set to a specific URL in an ASHX service.  The ASHX service grabs the file out of SharePoint and, based on query string params, returns the desired page as a Stream.p  pHere is how we shoot it backp  precode[WebServiceNamespace  url] [WebServiceBindingConformsTo  WsiProfiles.BasicProfile11] public class FileTransfer  IHttpHandler, IReadOnlySessionState      public void ProcessRequestHttpContext context         var stream  GetStreamcontext.Request         int chunkSize  2097152 2MB         byte[] chunk  new byte[chunkSize]         int bytesRead  0          do              bytesRead  stream.Readchunk, 0, chunkSize             HttpContext.Current.Response.OutputStream.Writechunk, 0, bytesRead                  while bytesRead gt 0  codepre  pThis works perfectly 100 of the time in any browser when the file we are breaking down comes directly from SharePoint.  p  pWe also provide a feature where the user can upload a document.  This is where the problem comes in.  Uploaded documents are not saved in SharePoint.  Instead their data is stored in SessionState until the user chooses to save.  Files are uploaded to an ASMX service, then the browser requests their individual pages via the above ASHX.p  pFiles are uploaded like this in an ASMX servicep  precode[WebMethodEnableSession  true] [ScriptMethodResponseFormat  ResponseFormat.Json] Public object Upload      var request  HttpContext.Current.Request     if request.Files.Count  1              var uniqueId  request[uniqueId]         var file  request.Files[0]          using var memoryStream  new MemoryStream                      file.InputStream.CopyTomemoryStream             docInfo  UploadItemuniqueId, pageNum, memoryStream.ToArray                codepre  pUploadItem adds the uniqueId and byte[] to SessionState.p  pFiles are sent from javascript like this FileUpload being tied to the change event of an input of typefilep  precodethis.FileUpload  function files      var upload  new XMLHttpRequest     upload.onreadystatechange   gt          if this.curUploadRequest.readyState  4               handle response                    UpdateFormDigestltanygtwindow.spPageContextInfo.webServerRelativeUrl,ltanygtwindow.spFormDigestRefreshInterval      var data  new FormData     data.appenduniqueId, uniqueId     data.appendpageNum, pageNum     data.appenddata, files[0]      upload.openPOST, myurl     upload.setRequestHeaderXRequestDigest, REQUESTDIGEST.val     upload.senddata  codepre  pstrongNow we come to the actual bug.strong  p  pImages are rendered usingp  precodeltimg srcurl to ASHX service gt codepre  pIn FireFox and Chrome, page images from uploaded documents always show up just fine.  But in IE 9, 10, or 11, it renders only the first portion of them, then shows broken image icons on the image placeholders.  For these broken images, the NET tab of IE shows it received 0kb and the error event is hit.  But if I put a breakpoint in the ASHX just before it returns the stream, it always has a size.p  pMore interestingly, if you take the url that the src is pointed to, open a new window and paste it in, the image shows up just fine.  p  pI even tried to load the images in javascript first like thisp  precodevar img  new Image img.onload  function     use jquery to append image to page  img.src  url to ASHX service codepre  pIn this scenario, Chrome and Firefox work fine as usual, but IE fails again.  Except this way, the NET tab of IE shows it received the correct size kb in response.  However, it still shows the broken image icon and wont render images to the screen after some unknown threshold.  The first several images come back, but once one breaks, all of the rest break.p  pI also modified the ASHX service to return base64 data instead of a stream, then bound the base64 to the src.  In the debugger you can see the base64 assigned to the src of the img elements that show the broken image icon.  So the data is there for sure, but IE just isnt rendering it...p  pI tried to recreate this problem outside of our SharePoint environment in this fiddle using knockout JS.  Basically, I grab a ton of big images and throw them on the screen with each button click.  But it works just fine.  It works perfectly if I use jQuery too. p  pa hrefhttpjsfiddle.netbsdez92f relnofollowhttpjsfiddle.netbsdez92fap  pNot sure where to go from here.  p  pAny ideasp

Negative 2681 pIn my previous question which was answered greatly, I was told how to interact with a website with selenium but unfortunately interacting with the flash game itself is now the problem. I have tried researching how to do it in Selenium but it cant be done. Ive seen FlashSelenium, Sikuli, and AutoIT.p  pI can only find documentation for FlashSelenium in Java, Its easier for me to use AutoIT rather than Sikuli as Id have to learn to use Jpython to create the kind of script I want to, which I am not straying away from learning just trying to finish this as fast as possible.

Negative 2681 pWe have a requirement where we need to process things for each account separately. For this, we thought of using codemultiple queuescode so that process of that corresponding account is assigned and handled by the specific queue. Also we planned this because we would need to handle only one process for each account i.e codeconcurrencycode in each queue. On looking into the codedocumentationcode, we could see that sidekiq recommends to have not more than codehandful of queuescode. In our case there will more number of accounts and each account will have a multiple process. So how can we achieve our requirement and what should be the good practice or way to do it. We also need multiple queues because we are planning to pause or stop the process specific to the account and we hope this can be handled at ease, if we have specific queues.p  pIf in case more queues are recommended in pro version we are ready to move but, how should we set codeconcurrency to 1code for each queue that needs to be added dynamically. Also tell us how we can handle adding more queues as the account growsp

Negative 2681 pApologies if the question is poorly phrased, Ill do my best.  p  pIf I have a sequence of values with times as an codeObservable[U,T]code where U is a value and T is a timelike type or anything differenceable I suppose, how could I write an operator which is an autoreset onetouch barrier, which is silent when codeabsun  ureset lt barriercode, but spits out codetn  tresetcode if the barrier is touched, at which point it also resets codeureset  uncode.p  pThat is to say, the first value this operator receives becomes the baseline, and it emits nothing.  Henceforth it monitors the values of the stream, and as soon as one of them is beyond the baseline value above or below, it emits the elapsed time measured by the timestamps of the events, and resets the baseline.  These times then will be processed to form a highfrequency estimate of the volatility.p  pFor reference, I am trying to write a volatility estimator outlined in a hrefhttprads.stackoverflow.comamznclick0470181990 relnofollowhttpwww.amazon.comVolatilityTradingCDROMWileydp0470181990a ,  where rather than measuring the standard deviation deviations at regular homogeneous times, you repeatedly measure the time taken to breach a barrier for some fixed barrier amount.p  pSpecifically, could this be written using existing operators  Im a bit stuck on how the state would be reset, though maybe I need to make two nested operators, one which is oneshot and another which keeps creating that oneshot... I know it could be done by writing one by hand, but then I need to write my own publisher etc etc.p  pThanksp

Negative 2681 pMy team has an API we wrote in PHP using the Slim Framework. Its being consumed by a web app and a third party mobile app. p  pWe use the standard OAuth 2 workflow to provide access to our resources. We can see if someone is a sending a valid access token along with the API request and that part of the flow makes sense.p  pThe stumbling block were running into is how to most efficiently authorize access to a resource depending on the permissions of the user associated with the access token.p  pFor the sake of simplicity lets say that we just want to ensure that the owner of the resource in question matches the owner of the access token. To me that seems like something that a route middleware would handle, for every request, before processing the request make sure that the resource owner ID matches that of the access token.p  pThe problem in my mind is that resource permissions arent necessarily consistent across all routes, a route isnt necessarily going to have an ID in the same section of the URI, it might not have an ID in the URI at all, etc. etc. p  pMy current solution has been to have an authorization utility class that takes in an email and checks it against the user thats currently logged in token owner. p  precodeclass Authorization      checkResourcePermissionsemail           if loggedInUsergtemail  email               return true                        codepre  pObviously this is a simplification, but what this means is that since a route middleware wont have the context of a request until that request goes through I will need to call this authorization method inside of every API route, responding with an error if necessary, etc. Our API is fairly large, essentially boiling this down to a large amount of copy and paste which always makes me very nervous. p  pWhat am I missing  p
