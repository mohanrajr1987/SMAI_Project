It  have function to search the flight, show the search result,book the flight and online payment.So, for the authorization I am planning to use oAuth. When the user visit the travel agency site they can search,book the flight and can do payment .Here, they dont have to authenticate for searching the flight and booking but payment is done by using third party.

So here goes...p  pstrongBackgroundstrong I have an ASP.NET MVC 5  Web Api 2  codebackbone.jscode multitenant SPA that already contains an implementation of the codeOAuthAuthorizationServerProvidercode along with a custom set of codeIUserStoreltMyIdentityUsergtcode and related implementations. The SPA calls the codeTokenEndpointcode by default, codetokencode using codejQuerycode to get a token and authenticate users. As you can probably tell, even though I coded this and have seen it work in production for almost two years, I am way too sketchy on the details of how it all actually works and whether what I am doing even makes sense.p  pstrongMotivationstrong The app is a multitenant app and I need to be able to lock down tenant sites prior to going live so they can test on a publicbutprotected URL specific to the tenant. Lets say McDonalds and Wendys are tenants. Then I have two MVC action URLs to lock down codesitemcdonaldscode and codesitewendyscode and every API route codeapicode so that the server should not respond to requests on any API route and respond with a challenge on the MVC route to perform tenantlevel login for the customer to view the site prior to deployment. That challenge could be basic auth, a form I dont necessarily mean the technical term codeForms Authenticationcode, I dont care  but the result should be that for subsequent requests in a time period, they are authorized to access, say, any of the URLs. I figure that once I have this working I can restrict it further to make sure tenants cannot see each others things. Let me also note that users are not tenantspecific in this application by design multiple tenants can share a single user with one or more profiles in each tenant.p  pstrongConfusionstrong Since I do not understand the relationship between the aforementioned concepts, I am having trouble understanding whether andor how I can segregate the two types of authentication  in my view, completely unrelated with different underlying stores  since it seems like the for a given app, you can only have one codeOAuthAuthorizationServerProvidercode and codeStartupcodetype class. I could try to mix in this new store and make the codeIUserltTgtcode more complicated carrying both a loggedin tenant andor a loggedin user, and requiring neither necessarily. I could try to implement authentication somewhere else, say, as a codeMessageHandlercode that sends a Basic Authentication challenge and sets the codeThread.CurrentPrincipalcode on a valid response. I could try to set some sort of cookie that is independent of the existing cookie that gets created when logging in via codetokencode. But before I can really know what to do, and unless I am just told what to do, I really need to understand at a conceptual level what the relationship is between these things and emespeciallyem strongwhich, if any, of these things must be unique in a given Xstrong, where strongXstrong is application, request, thread, session, etc. I think that last part is the hardest for me to understand.p

Negative 58679 pAlright, I recently wrote a ajax push script which had php on the backend sleeping while waiting for someone to make an update. However, the sleeping processes took up a lot of cpu.

Negative 58679 pI have a grid of rectangular cells covering a plane sitting at some distance from the coordinate system origin and would like to identify the grid cell where a straight line starting at the origin would intersect it.p  pThe cells on the grid have equal sizes dx,dy and there are no gaps between cells, but since every cell on the plane has a different distance from the origin, the solid angle they cover is not constant  if it was I could find a simple function that translates a direction theta,phi into a cell index ix,iy.p  pCurrently I use something like a nearestneighbor search to find cells, but this doesnt exploit the griddedness of my cells at all.

Negative 58679 pWhats the best way to execute a function emexactly onceem every time a button is clicked, regardless of click speed and browserp  pSimply binding a click handler works perfectly in all browsers except IE.p  pIn IE, when the user clicks too fast, only dblclick fires, so the click handler is never executed.  Other browsers trigger both events so its not a problem for them.p  pThe obvious solutionhack to me at least is to attach a dblclick handler in IE that triggers my click handler twice.

Negative 58679 pIm on a fairly new project where were still modifying the design of our Oracle 11g database tables.  As such, we drop and recreate our tables fairly often to make sure that our table creation scripts work as expected whenever we make a change.p  pOur database consists of 2 schemas.  One schema has some tables with codeINSERTcode triggers which cause the data to sometimes be copied into tables in our second schema.  This requires us to log into the database with an admin account such as codesysdbacode and codeGRANTcode access to the first schema to the necessary tables on the second schema, e.g.p  precodeGRANT ALL ON schematwo.SomeTable TO schemaone codepre  pOur problem is that every time we make a change to our database design and want to drop and recreate our database tables, the access we codeGRANTcodeed to codeschemaonecode went away when the table was dropped.  Thus, this creates another annoying step wherein we must log in with an admin account to recodeGRANTcode the access every time one of these tables is dropped and recreated.p  pThis isnt a huge deal, but Id love to eliminate as many steps as possible from our development and testing procedures.  Is there any way to codeGRANTcode access to a table in such a way that the codeGRANTcodeed permissions survive a table being dropped and then recreated  And if this isnt possible, then is there a better way to go about thisp

Negative 58679 pI have been reading about bit operators in ObjectiveC in Kochans book, Programming in ObjectiveC.p  pI am VERY confused about this part, although I have really understood most everything else presented to me thus far.p  pHere is a quote from the bookp  pstrongThe Bitwise AND Operatorstrongp  pBitwise ANDing is frequently used for masking operations.  That is, this operator can be used easily to set specific bits of a data item to 0.  For example, the statementp  precodew3  w1 amp 3 codepre  passigns to w3 the value of w1 bitwise ANDed with the constant 3.  This has the same ffect of setting all the bits in w, other than the rightmost two bits to 0 and preserving the rightmost two bits from w1.p  pAs with all binary arithmetic operators in C, the binary bit operators can also be used as assignment operators by adding an equal sign.  The statementp  precodeword amp 15 codepre  ptherefore performs the same function as the followingp  precodeword  word amp 15 codepre  pAdditionally, it has the effect of setting all but the rightmost four bits of word to 0.  When using constants in performing bitwise operations, it is usually more convenient to express the constants in either octal or hexadecimal notation.p  pOK, so that is what Im trying to understand.  Now, Im extremely confused with pretty much this entire concept and I am just looking for a little clarification if anyone is willing to help me out on that.p  pWhen the book references setting all the bits now, all of the bits.. What exactly is a bit.  Isnt that just a 0 or 1 in 2nd base, in other words, binaryp  pIf so, why, in the first example, are all of the bits except the rightmost 2 to 0  Is it 2 because its 3  1, taking 3 from our constantp  pThanksp

Negative 58679 pIve been puzzling over how best to architect an application Im due to begin work on shortly and nothing simple is coming to mind. Maybe someone else can see something that Im missing. p  pThe objective is pretty simple  construct an app in CWinForms to allow the user to specify a file to be loaded, then visualize that files contents in 3D, allow the user to tweak some properties, and then run a simulation.p  pThe tricky part is the backend. I have two files to load.p  pThe first isnt specified by the user, but rather comes emoutem of an older C application and is XML format and will be loaded automatically. The XML file describes its object structure  each class, its properties, and the corresponding min, max, and default values for those properties, as well as a text field documenting the property. This file is used to set updefine the classesproperties. This file continues to change on a fairly regular basis, so the objective here to is import these XML definitions so as not to link this new UI too closely with the older app.p  pThe second file contains the input that is relevant to the user. This file describes what objects will be used and the values relevant to a subset of the classesproperties  described in the first file.p  pThats it.p  pAs I said, Ive considered several ways of doing this, but they all seem archaic. One method Ive thought about this First, create a factorydispatcher that reads and constructs a class of type Loadable to represent those classes defined in the XML then create a generic Property to store the properties themselves and store them in a collection of some sort within the Loadable object. My thought is that this way, I can reference those Loadables later on when loading the users file or when pulling them up in a PropertyGrid for userediting.p  pThoughts Am I on crack Is there a simpler way to tackle this that Im not seeing through the trees Any comments would be welcome.p

Negative 58679 pIm looking to create a glowing line effect in BlitzMax, something like a Star Wars lightsaber or laserbeam.

Im happy to use 3D features, but it will be for use in a 2D game.p  pSince it will be on blackspace background, my strategy is to draw a series of white blurred lines with color and high transparency, then eventually central lines less blurred and more white. What I want to draw is actually bezier curved lines. Drawing curved lines is easy enough, but I cant use the technique above to create a good laserneon effect because it comes out looking very segmented. So, I think it may be better to use a blur effectshader on what does render well, which is a 1pixel bezier curve.p  pThe problems Ive been having arep  ul liApplying a shader to just a certain area of the screen where lines are drawn.

Negative 58679 pEDIT I cant get some of the indents to work correctly, but the code is complete and blocked correctly. Sorry.p  pFor a class assignment Ive had to implement part of a simple UNIX shell. It must support redirection, piping, and backgrounding. I was provided with a parser that populates a struct called Commandline Ill include the struct prototype below. My job is to write a function that processes these Commandlines handles redirection, backgrounding, piping, and executes programs. p  pIve almost got it working but for some reason it doesnt properly handle commands of the form emprogram1  program2  fileem. For example, cat lt file1.in  cat  file2.in. The problem doesnt seem to be in the redirection as Ive written test programs to put in front of the pipe that do not require redirection but still cause the same problem. The pipelining does work in most cases its just these programs with  as an argument that cause problems.p  pWhen I run one of these problematic command lines, the output from the first program is printed and the process hangs up I have to manually suspend and kill it. It does not give the user a prompt afterwards or react to input aside from ctrl  z which I use to suspend the process.p  pAny advice on how to get this working would be much appreciated.p  pHeres the structp  precode This is the structure that holds the information about a parsed   command line.

Negative 58679 pGood morning all, Wondering if you could please help me with the following query I have just started learning Python last weekend after a colleague of mine showed me how to dramatically cut the time a Bash script takes to execute by rewriting it in Python.  I was amazed at how fast it ran.  I would now like to do the same thing with another script I have.p  pThis other script reads a log file and using AWK it filters certain fields from the log and writes them to a new file.  See below the regex the script is executing.  I would like to rewrite this regex in Python as my script is currently taking about 1 hour to execute on a log file with about 100,000 lines.  I would like to cut this time down as much as possible.p  precodecat logspdulogfe.log  awk F print 1,NF  awk F. print 1,NF  awk print 1,4,5  sort  uniq  while read service command status do echo Service service, Command command, Status status, Occurrences grep service logspdulogfe.log  grep command  grep status  wc l  awk  print 1  gtgt logspdulogfeclean.log done codepre  pThis AWK command gets lines which look like thisp  precode20110516 094622,361 [Thread4847133] PDU D ltGCCSMSSERVICE51408656.O CCSMSSERVICE51408656ServerThreadVASPSessionThread7ee35fb07e8711e0a2da00238bce423bTRX  20110516 094622  OUT  submitresp pdu L 53 ID 80000004 Status 0 SN 25866 980530907f9011e0a2da00238bce423b opt   gt codepre  pAnd outputs lines like thisp  pCCSMSSERVICE51408 submitresp 0p  pI have tried writing the Python script myself but I am getting stuck writing the regex.

The current log file, as I mentioned previously, has thousands of lines like thisp  p20110516 094622,361 [Thread4847133] PDU D p  pAll the lines in the log file are similar and they all have the same length same amount of fields.

Users start with a basic pizza and then can add toppings to it until theyre done.  So the first thing that my newPizza function does is declare the new Pizza as a codePlaincode, which is a subclass of abstract class codePizzacode.p  pThen they get to enter their choice of toppings.  Each time, a pointer to the same codePizzacode object is sent to the codeaddToppingscode function, the new decoration is added, and the pointer is returned.  Each decoration inherits from a price category, which inherits from codepizzaToppingscode, which inherits from codePizzacode.p  pThis is the relevant part of the main order functionp  precodePizza MenunewPizza  cout ltlt nNew Pizza  accept the next choice int choose  0  create the new pizza Plain  currentPizza  new Plain  until they choose to end the order while choose  3      accept the choice     cin gtgt choose      switch choose              if they want to add a new topping     case 1                      add topping to current pizza            and this is where the problem is spotted by the compiler             addToppingcurrentPizza             break          codepre  pThe issue is that when I try to send the pointer codecurrentPizzacode to the function codeaddToppingcode, I get  RunTime Check Failure 3  The variable currentPizza is being used without being initialized.p  pDidnt I  just initialize it right there on line 7p  pIf I hit continue, the program keeps going, and works, but I get that same error every time I call the function.

Negative 58679 pIt may sound silly, but if every class implicitly extends Object class and it is allowed to extend one more class, how is it not multiple inheritance From users point of view it may be argued that they dont support multiple inheritance, because user is not allowed to extend more than one class. However, the languages seem to have internal support for multiple inheritance, which is just not exposed to user probably to keep it simple. Am I making sense p  pNote Im not arguing for or against support of multiple inheritance. Just trying to clarify some thoughts.p

Negative 58679 pIve been using Checkstyle with Eclipse, with a rule for making all local variables final. This rule is enforced when saving, so if a file containing a local variable without a final modifier is saved, final is automatically added to the variable declaration.p  pNow Ive switched to IntelliJ IDEA, and im using Checkstyle to enforce this same rule here. But, instead of automatically adding the final modifier when saving, the variables are marked as erroneous, and I have to press ALTenter enter to get the final modifier added, once for each variable.

Negative 58679 pIm in the process of understanding how to put instruments to better use. I just finished a leak management exercise, and instruments is reporting very few leaks. Ill figure those out later. In the mean time, my app is crashing, and it appears that its related to memory pressure.p  pSo I looked at this in Instruments. I have Allocations and Memory Monitor in use. Allocations shows a pretty steady 3 to 4 MB Live bytes while I just let my app initialize and come to equilibrium.

I tried explicitly cloning the element passing true to preserve data and events, then appending that element, but the problem persists.p  pI can resolve the issue by using HTML5 codedatacode attributes in the HTML for the anchor, rather than using the code.datacode function. Thats fine for now, since theres only a few, but its not as easily scalable.p  pSo, I have a few questionsp  ol liIs my thoughtassumption likely to be correct Is calling code.appendcode with a newly created element from a popup to add to an element in the parent window likely to clone the element even though there seems to be no reason to do soli liIs there a way  other than going in and modifying the jQuery source code  to tell code.appendcode and similar functions to preserve data and event information for any clones it creates as part of execution I dont think it does this by defaultli liAm I doing something inherently wrong in the above code thats causing the problemli ol

Negative 58679 pI have a large bit of code that takes about 5 minutes to run in debug mode of Visual Studio, and about 10 seconds to run in release mode. p  pThis becomes an enormous issue when I have to debug code at the end of the program, where I have to wait far too long just for the program to hit the breakpoint.p  pI gave serialization a shot, and used boostserialize to serialize all the variables before the debug code, but it turns out that deserializing all those variables still takes a minute or two. p  pSo what gives Im aware that many optimizations and inline stuff is disabled when running code in debug mode, but it strikes me as very peculiar that it takes almost 2 orders of magnitude longer to run the code in debug mode. Are there any hacks or something programmers use to bypass this wait time I know theres lots of programs out there much more computationally intensive than mine, but I highly doubt that they would wait 5 minutes just for their debug code to hit a breakpoint.p

You need to be able to run a background process on the server, install   an SSL certificate, and be able to make outgoing TLS connections on   certain ports.

Negative 58679 pIm storing file system hierarchies of directories and files.p  pIn an innodb table, I store the details of each directoryfile and maintain the parent child relationship with a foreign key constraint that will cascade on delete.p  pA myisam table is used to search these directoriesfiles with a full text search. It contains the names and ids of each row.p  pAny rows in the data table innodb table will have a corresponding row in the search table myisam table and adding or removing rows from the data table must be reflected in the search table.p  pIm trying to find the best solution to maintain data consistency between the two tables when deleting a parent directory. The innodb table is fine. I delete the parent, the delete cascades through the children until they are all deleted. Deleting the corresponding rows from the myisam table is more difficult.p  pMy first thought was to use an ondelete trigger on the innodb table. When a row is deleted, it deletes the corresponding row from myisam table. However, since MySQL does not activate triggers during a cascade delete a known bug for 7 years that was fixed by mentioning the lack of support in the manual, that is not an option.p  pMy second thought was put a parent child relationship in the search table, but it is a myisam table to support the full text search functionality, and so it does not support foreign key constraints.p  pI had heard that innodb now supports full text searches, so I thought maybe I could change the search table engine, but its only available in the lab release.p  pMy last thought was to abandon foreign key constraints and use only triggers to maintain data consistency. On delete, delete from both innodb and myisam table where parent  OLD.id. However, to prevent endless loops that could corrupt all data in the table, MySQL does not support manipulating the data in the same table that activated the trigger.p  pI have resorted to programmatically retrieving all children under the parent directory through a loop of requests, however, I feel there has got to be a better option. strongIs there any other work around that would be more efficientstrong At this point, the only two options I can think of are waiting for one of the above approaches to be fixed or changing to a different RDBMS like PostgreSQL that does support firing triggers from a cascade delete.p  pAny other ideas would be greatly appreciated.p

So why dont we say C or other languages are also a platform independent languages.p  pemJava is actually very much dependent on the Java platform. Also, C is arguably a very portable language.

Negative 58679 pI have a question about mobile application development. Im wanting to develop an application for my Kindle and looking through the tutorials I found that HTML5 CSS and JavaScript could be used to develop Mobile Applications instead of native Programming language like Java, Objective C and so on. p  pDont get me wrong I have nothing against learning a little more Java and the KindleAndroid specific APIs. But knowing that you could use HTML5 CSS JavaScript for the Android, Blackberry  and iOS platforms AND WEBSITES sound very interesting to me. Ive have also seen Game frameworks like Playn from Google that seems to do a pretty good job with HTML5 and JavaScript. p  pMy question is, is it worth the learning curve of each individual API, and programming languages or are HTML5 CSS JavaScript just going to change the way we do front end developmentp  pAny input on this will be very appreciated. p

Here is the codep  precodeimport Control.Applicative import System.IO  ex x y   ltgt x ltgt y  test1  ex abc [pqr, xyz]   only this works correctly as expected test2  ex abc [Just pqr, Just xyz] test3  ex abc Just pqr test4  ex Just a [pqr, xyz] test5  ex return abc IO  [Just pqr, Just xyz] codepre  pThis produces a lot of type errors, which though I can partially understand, I couldnt resolve them at all.p  pThe errors are given at the end.p  pSo, how do I combine the Maybe Applicative and the List Applicative for examplep  pHow do I combine the State Applicative and the List Applicative for example Are there any other examples, lets say, combining Maybe and List, Maybe and State and finally the dreadful of all the IO and State applicativesp  pThanks.p  pThe GHCi error msgs follow.p  precodeexample.hs619     Couldnt match expected type [Char] with actual type Maybe a0     In the return type of a call of Just     In the expression Just pqr     In the second argument of ex, namely [Just pqr, Just xyz]  example.hs719     Couldnt match expected type [[Char]] with actual type Maybe a0     In the return type of a call of Just     In the second argument of ex, namely Just pqr     In the expression ex abc Just pqr  example.hs823     Couldnt match expected type Maybe with actual type []     In the second argument of ex, namely [pqr, xyz]     In the expression ex Just a [pqr, xyz]     In an equation for test4 test4  ex Just a [pqr, xyz]  example.hs921     Couldnt match expected type  with actual type [Char]     In the first argument of return, namely abc     In the first argument of ex, namely return abc  IO      In the expression       ex return abc  IO  [Just pqr, Just xyz] Failed, modules loaded none.

Negative 58679 pIn my ObjectiveC application, I have a hierarchy of subclasses of codeNSObjectcode which constitute a model. These objects have no functionality on their own, i.e. they only have properties and their sole purpose is to hold data. Furthermore I have a single controller that manages instances of this hierarchy tree. p  pOnly that controller shall be allowed to make changes to the tree e.g. the properties of the objects in the tree. Other parts of the program shall have readonly access to the whole tree.p  pWhat is the easiest way to accomplish this type of access managementp

Negative 58679 pI am a beginner with Akka, and I enjoy many of the functionalities it provides for asynchronous programming, such as Actors, Agents or Futures.p  pA strong selling point of Akka is the fact that when an actor crashes, an equivalent actor is created anew by the actor system and plugged in place of the old one, guaranteeing strong stability.p  pSome other systems I am told JMS is one go one step further and persist the messages sent between actors continously. This way, if the machine crashes physically  say because of a hardware failure  it is still possible to restore the state as it was before the fault.p  pThis is very appealing for the application I am developing right now. Does Akka provide any such mechanism If not, is there some way to integrate it with an external system in such a way that this can be achievedp

Negative 58679 pI have a simple question that concerns security in WebMatrix razor Cp  pI for a very brief period of time considered using character checking to help validate forms to combat SQL injection, however, after realizing that parameterizing queries is the best way to combat this, I have since commented out this check which looks something like thisp  precode    foreachchar c in POIName              ifc  c  c  camp  c  c  c  clt  cgt                      errorMessage  You have entered at least one invalid character in the POI Name field. Invalid characters are [], [], [amp], [], [], [], [lt], [gt], and []               codepre  pNow, my question is this Should I remove lines like these entirely, as they are not needed to allow maximum user freedom in textareas etc. or should there still be some character checking specific to WebMatrix or not specific to it for that matter.p  pPerhaps not allow  or  or lt or p  pFrom what I understand paramaterizing the queries as I have auto escapes harmful characters and rewraps the whole thing as a string or something like that anyway, lol, and my database has proven impervious to any of the SQL injection attacks I have thrown at it.p  pI guess I am concerned because I am not sure if razor can be effected somehow or if I should worry about XSS no I am not a blog or anything that should ever accept html tags or even angle brackets of any kind.p  pSorry if this question is kind of all over the place, but I dont know where else to turn to find as definitive of an answer as Stack Overflow usually provides e.g., I trust this community much more than a few Google searches, which I assure I have tried before posting.p  pThanks for any helpp

Negative 58679 pOn my page, when you swipe right on an element, the element will move. I have the following code to handle these swipesp  precodewindow.addEventListenertouchstart, touchStart, false window.addEventListenertouchmove, touchMove, false codepre  pProblem is, its not just affecting the elements that I want to be swipeable. Instead, if I swipe anywhere on the page, it will run codetouchMovecode. To fix this, I triedp  precodevar content  document.getElementByIdcontent content.addEventListenertouchstart, touchStart, false content.addEventListenertouchmove, touchMove, false codepre  pThis sort of worked, but when a div was shown via user interaction over codecontentcode, the events would still fire.p  pAnother solution that I considered was binding these events to the elements in codecontentcode, the ones that should have swiping enabled. Problem is, these elements are added to the page dynamically, so when the function above is called on page load, the elements arent accounted for. I then looked to using jQuerys code.oncode method, like sop  precodecontent .row.ontouchmove, touchMove, false codepre  pBut thats not calling codetouchMovecode at all.p  pIs there a better way to do all of this Does it make sense that codetouchMovecode would get called on an element thats not a child of codecontentcode when  the event listener is assigned to only codecontentcodep

Negative 58679 pI am working on internationalizing an old MFC project and I have many thousands of hardcoded strings to move into the string table.  Im looking for a macro, addin, or some information on creating a macro, addin, or wizard that would allow me to semiautomate the process.  I would like to be able to highlight a string, rightclick and select something like move to resource and have the string added to the string table for the project.  Something customizable would be great such that I could edit the identifier created and have the tool replace the hardcoded string in the code with a look up function that I provide the name of.  I searched for a few days and cant find anything like this.  Does anyone know of a tool already in existence, or can provide some info on what VS extensiblity classes I can use to write one  I am using VS2010.p  pThanks.p

This theme uses two scripts columnize.js and columnizer.js to display posts in three columns.p  pOne of my goals was to make the theme swap between 1, 2 or 3 columns depending on the size of the window.p  pIm able to do that on document.ready, but for some reason I cant trigger a change on window.resize under my two conditions I can just trigger it with a width size change, but it would do it nonstop and a timer isnt what Im looking for.p  pIve made these changes to columnize.js, which is being called inside a  right before the .p  pThis is what my latest attempt looks likep  precode    jQuery.noConflict var smallWindow var windowsize  jQuerywindow.width need to use jQuery instead of   jQuerydocument.readyfunction     if windowsize lt 868  if page opens on a small window         jQuery.mcol.makeacolumnlistscols 2, colWidth 305, equalHeight ul, startN 1 creates the columns         jQuery.mcol2.makeacolumnlistscols 3, colWidth 293, equalHeight ul, startN 1         smallWindow  true for the next if condition on resize         alertsmallWindow just to check if it works          else  if page opens on a big window         jQuery.mcol.makeacolumnlistscols 3, colWidth 305, equalHeight ul, startN 1         jQuery.mcol2.makeacolumnlistscols 3, colWidth 293, equalHeight ul, startN 1         smallWindow  false         alertsmallWindow        jQuerywindow.resizefunction      if windowsize lt 868 ampamp smallWindow  false nothing works here, these conditions were here to keep the function from triggering when not necessary, i.e. would only trigger below a certain width if window above that width         jQuery.mcol.uncolumnlists removes old columns         jQuery.mcol.makeacolumnlistscols 2, colWidth 305, equalHeight ul, startN 1 creates new columns         smallWindow  true changes to stop the function from triggering on further resize down         alertsmallWindow          else if windowsize gt 867 ampamp smallWindow  true         jQuery.mcol.uncolumnlists         jQuery.mcol.makeacolumnlistscols 3, colWidth 305, equalHeight ul, startN 1         smallWindow  false changes to stop the function from triggering on further resize up         alertsmallWindow          else false  codepre  pI have no idea of what Im doing wrong. Any help would be greatly appreciated.p  h2Edit 1h2  pThanks for the help.

Got to scratch my head on that, but Ill share my issue here because youre faster than me. p  h2Edit 2h2  pOkay, I got it. I had to make the smallWindow variable false when it should be true and vice versa, so I could force the resize function to trigger on load. Still, I feel stupid because Ive tried multiple ways but I still cant declare a global variable... So Im repeating myself with the windowsize var...p  precodejQuerydocument.readyfunction   var windowsize  window.width if windowsize lt868      var smallWindow  false  else      var smallWindow  true   window.onresize, function       var windowsize  window.width      if windowsize lt 868 ampamp smallWindow          .mcol.uncolumnlists         .mcol.makeacolumnlists cols 2, colWidth 305, equalHeight ul, startN 1          smallWindow  true      else if windowsize gt 868 ampamp smallWindow          .mcol.uncolumnlists         .mcol.makeacolumnlists cols 3, colWidth 305, equalHeight ul, startN 1          smallWindow  false      .triggerresize  codepre  pThanks for the helpp

Negative 58679 pSo I am trying to figure out an algorithm for a program that would use recursion for taking an int array of x numbers and dividing it into n sets. These numbers can be both positive and negative. The sets need to have the smallest difference possible between them. p  pFor example if you gave the program the int array [1, 2, 3, 4] and tell it to divide into 3 groups, then it would divide it into [1, 3] [2] and [4] where the difference between the sets is 2.  Another example is if you gave the array [6, 6, 6, 10, 10] and tell it to divide into 2 groups, then it would divide it into [10, 10] and [6, 6, 6] where the difference between the sets is 2. p  pWe can assume the array is sorted into ascending order with smallest at the left and largest at the right since sorting it would be a simple sort statement. Any ideasp  pEDIT I understand that I am dealing with a Partition problem and I have tried the Greedy Algorithm where you go from largest to smallest numbers and put them in the group with the lowest sum but it wouldnt work for the second example I gave above so I am looking for a more reliable algorithm. p
Negative 58679 pI can not find why the background of my subview shrinks toward the upper left corner of the subview the first time I move it or animate it.  not sure if it is technically a subview since the object I dragged on to my main view was labeled Viewp  pFor this example, I will provide an animated example so that you can see what is going on easier.p  pHere are my .h entries 2 objects, a button and a viewp  precodeproperty weak, nonatomic IBOutlet UIView floatPad  IBActiontoggleButtonUIButton sender codepre  pFor this example iPad the view is located at 20, 800 with a size of 728, 186.  I also set the background to light grey in the Interface Builder to show whats going on better.p  pThe button toggles the view on and off the screen, sliding via animation code off and on through the bottom of the screen.p  pHere are my .m entries 1 BOOL, 1 UIColor, plus the viewDidLoad and toggleButton codep  precodeinterface ViewController   property assign, nonatomic BOOL floatPadVisible property retain, nonatomic UIColor redBackground  end  implementation ViewController  synthesize floatPad synthesize floatPadVisible synthesize redBackground   voidviewDidLoad  floatPadVisibleYES     redBackground  [UIColor colorWithRed179255.0 green1255.0 blue54255.0 alpha1.0]      [super viewDidLoad]    IBActiontoggleButtonUIButton sender   if floatPadVisible  is floatPadVisible BOOL set to YES     [UIView beginAnimationsfloatPad contextnil]     [UIView setAnimationDuration1.5]     [UIView setAnimationDelegateself]     [floatPad setFrameCGRectMake20, 1004, 584, 145]     [floatPad setBackgroundColorredBackground]     [UIView commitAnimations]     floatPadVisible  NO      else      [UIView beginAnimationsfloatPad contextnil]     [UIView setAnimationDuration1.5]     [UIView setAnimationDelegateself]     [floatPad setFrameCGRectMake20, 800, 584, 145]     [UIView commitAnimations]     floatPadVisible  YES       codepre  pThe problem is that the first time you hit the toggle button, the view doesnt move, only the background shrinks.  I say shrinks, because you can still the the 20 point space on the left side of the view.  If you put an object inside the view, it doesnt move, which tells me the view isnt shrinking, only the background.  After the first toggle the button operates as expected.  I added the background change color code to show that the first toggle never calls the animation code, evident by the fact that the background doesnt change color until the second toggle.p

Negative 58679 pFirst of all, I should admit I have submitted this question on the altera forum a hrefhttpwww.alteraforum.comforumshowthread.phpt40494 relnofollowhttpwww.alteraforum.comforumshowthread.phpt40494a. I am asking here too because I think it is likely to be quite a different audience. If this duplicate post is against any stack overflow rules or etiquette please let me know and Ill remove it. If not ill update the forum submission with any answers I receive here and vice versa. p  pIm trying to integrate an I2C core from opencores to my Cyclone IV device. Apparently the version Im using should just drop into the SOPC and work after being wired to some outputs a hrefhttpalterawiki.comwikiI2C28OpenCores29 relnofollowalterawiki.comwikiI2COpenCoresa. The core compiles with no errors or warnings. p  pThe I2C docs with the core show 6 relevant registers addressed one after another PRERlo, PRERhi, CTR, TXR, RXR, CR, SR. However, when I attempt to write to these registers the write is put into the wrong address whether from my code or manually in debug memory window. p  pTo investigate this I set the registers to initial values in VHDL to see the result in the debug window. This showed that the register addresses for TXR and CR are not what is suggested in the docs. p  precodeAddress   0  1  2  3  09866160 AA 00 00 00  PRERlo 09866164 00 00 00 00  PRERhi 09866168 BB 00 00 00  CTR 0986616C DD 00 00 00  RXR 09866170 FA 00 00 00  SR 09866174 CC 00 00 00  TX 09866174 EE 00 00 00  CR codepre  pThis would be fine, however, when I attempt to write to address 09866174 TXR the value is inserted at 09866164 PRERhi. Similarly when I write to 09866178 CR the value is inserted into 09866168CTR. This happens whether the write comes from the code or manually from the debug window. This is particularly confusing as writing to these registers works fine in VHDL.p  precodedefine IOWRbase,offset,value builtinstwio unsigned intBASE  OFFSET, DATA IOWRI2CMASTERBASE, 5, 0x1D  codepre  pI have attempted to debug this from signal tap also. However, triggers on any of the registers are never implemented.p  pId really appreciate if anyone can point me in the right direction here. p  pThanks p  pupdate I have been using the VHDL version of the core.

Here is what i wonder The comments in the code say that when we use proxy image objects, if we load a picture into memory, just that image is loaded. But if we do not use proxy and directly create real images, when we load an instance of this class, we load all instances of the class into memory. I do not understand why this is the case. Yes, the whole point of proxy pattern is to do this, but i do not understand why all 3 of the highResolutionImageNoProxy objects are loaded into memory when we call highResolutionImageNoProxy2.showImage . Can anyonbody explain itp  pThanksp  pstrongEditstrong I think i figured out why. Because the ImageProxy class calls the constructor of HighResolutionImage class only when it tries to do an operation on the object, but if we create a HighResolutionImage directly, then since its constructor creates the object, all of them are loaded into memory.p

So I wrote the following python programp  precode complexity.py from PIL import Image from cStringIO import StringIO import time import sys  def mesurecomplexityimagepath, iterations  10000     with openimagepath, rb as f         data  f.read     dataio  StringIOdata      t1  time.time     for i in xrangeiterations         dataio.seek0         Image.opendataio, r     t2  time.time     return t2  t1  def main     for filepath in sys.argv[1]         print filepath, mesurecomplexityfilepath  if name  main     main codepre  pIt can be used like thisp  precodepython complexity.py blank.jpg blackandwhitelogo.jpg trees.jpg random.jpg blank.jpg 1.66653203964 blackandwhitelogo.jpg 1.33399987221 trees.jpg 1.62251782417 random.jpg 0.967066049576 codepre  pAs you can see, Im not getting the expected results at all, especially for the blank.jpg file it should be the one with the lowest complexity quickest decompression time.  So either the article I read is utterly wrong I really doubt it, it was a serious scientific article, or PIL is not doing what I think its doing.  Maybe the actual conversion to a bitmap is done lazily, when its actually needed  But then why would the codeopencode delays differ  The smallest jpg file is of course the blank image, and the largest is the random image.  This really does not make sense.p  pNote 1 when running the program multiple times, I get roughly the same results the results are absurd, but stable.  p  pNote 2 all images have the same size width x height.p  pstrongEditstrongp  pI just tried with png images instead of jpeg, and now everything behaves as expected.  Cool I just sorted about 50 images by complexity, and they emdoem look more and more complex.  I checked the article BTW, its an article by JeanPaul Delahaye in Pour la Science, April 2013 the author actually mentions that he used only lossless compression algorithms.  So I guess the answer is that codeopencode emdoesem decompress the image, but my program did not work because I should have used images compressed with lossless algorithms only png, but not jpeg.p

Negative 58679 pIn OpenCL, I want to store a vector 3D using a Shared Exponent representation for compact storage. Typically, if you store a 3D floating point vector, you simply store 3 separate float values or 4 when aligned properly.

Negative 58679 pI am trying to write an Android application that can send and receive serial data to and from an Arduino board that is connected by an OnTheGo OTG adapter. I am using the a hrefhttpcode.google.compusbserialforandroid relnofollowusbserialforandroida library.

I basically want these two to send data back and forth.  The Arduino side of this project is working perfectly, whenever it receives data it records everything to an SD card, and if it detects the T it will send a T back to tell the Android it can send again.p  pHere is my code, sorry for the length but I feel that there could be multiple places that could be the problemp  precodepublic class MainActivity extends Activity   private boolean canSend

codepre  pNotice that I am trying to use two separate drivers with the same IO manager. I am not sure if that should negatively affect it. I am able to send the data to the Arduino, and the Arduinos TX led comes on, so I know something is being sent. The onNewData method that is triggered when the SerialInputOutputManager listener detects incoming data is never being ran.  So I take it that the driver for the managers listener is not getting initialized correctly or something.  p  pIf anyone has a better method of talking between the Android and the Arduino via twoway usb serial, please let me know what it is.  I have had a lot of trouble trying to get this to work.      p

Negative 58679 pI am just learning C and looking deeper into data types.  p  pWhy isnt a codeboolcode data type 1 bit in sizep  pIt seems it can only hold one of two values true or false, so wouldnt that only take up 1 bit of space to represent that value  p  pIs it because the smallest addressable size of a value is a byte 8 bits as referred to in a hrefhttpstackoverflow.coma20645651063287this postap  pMy overall aim was to logically envisage the different size of each data type in C so I was trying to create a list of all data types and their allocated bit size and this threw me.  p

Negative 58679 pIm developing a website in which there must be at least five codeltsectiongtcodes, each the size of the viewport.p  pHeres a a hrefhttpjsfiddle.netxBswq relnofollowFiddlea.p  pBut instead of solid colors, Im dealing with large at least 1000px images, all resized according to codebackgroundsize covercode. That works fine in WebKit browsers, but Firefox is a different story. The larger the images get, the choppier Firefox becomes. And it all has to do with codebackgroundsize covercode. Without it, everything is smooth. In fact, Ive found it applies to all image scaling in Firefox.p  pA coworker suggested I use codeltcanvasgtcode to draw the image offscreen to the proper size, convert the canvas to base 64, and apply it as the codebackgroundimagecode to each codeltsectiongtcode, but that only works for small images. Like I said, these images could be very large, so that option doesnt seem feasible.p  blockquote   pSo my question is how can I use these large background images, resize them properly, and maintain good performance in Firefoxp blockquote  pemSide note Im running a MacBook Pro with Retina display, so I dont think my system specifications are the issue here. It has also been tested on other nonRetina MacBook Pros and the problem persists.emp

Negative 58679 h2Im trying to use the Dynamic load on my website using Jquery code.loadcode and this is how I found my way with ith2  ul liThere are a bunch of pages index.html, page1.html, page2.html, pageOVERNINETHOUSAND.html, etc.brli liindex, as I want it, needs to open the page1.html and page2.html.li lipage1 is where rests the navigation of the site. All main links go here, so I want to load it in a codenavcode tag that will be at top of the page.li lipage2 is the main page, the content, that will be loaded in the index as well. It has to load in an codearticlecode tag.li liAll other pages must replace the page2, since I want to keep page1 always there.li ul  pThats pretty simple, initially. What I did was load both pages on index, and the links in page1, the navigation, were set to replace the codearticlecode tag.p  pBut what if someone enters another page, not index, for example a random user finds my page4.html through google What will happen is that there wont be the navigation, therefore, it fails.p  pThe solution I found was to make all pages work like the index, where all of them have the codenavcode and codearticlecode tags and make the navigation replace all the body of the current page.p  pstrongindexstrongp  precodeltDOCTYPE htmlgt ltheadgt ltscriptgt document.readyfunction     body.loadpage2.html  ltscriptgt ltheadgt  ltbodygt ltbodygt lthtmlgt codepre  pstrongpage2, the main onestrongp  precodeltDOCTYPE htmlgt ltheadgt ltscriptgt document.readyfunction     nav.loadpage1.html   ltscriptgt ltheadgt  ltbodygt ltnavgt page1 will be loaded here ltnavgt  ltarticlegt  Lots of code here ltarticlegt ltbodygt lthtmlgt codepre  pSo every single page will need to have this same code that will call the strongnavigationstrong to be displayed. But that kind of invalidates the codearticlecode, instead it uses the body tag to change the content and the dynamic load becomes not so dynamic. Plus itll make me insert codenav.loadpage1.htmlcode in all of the god knows many pages.p  pI wanted to only replace the codearticlecode, not the entire page and avoid the massive copy and paste. But I cant see to find a solution to the problem of the navigation display without this.p

Negative 58679 pNote Im still relatively new to ASP.Net MVC, so Im emprobablyem taking the wrong approach here dont hesitate to say so.p  pThe summary of the issue is that, if I have a view thats stronglytyped to some collection of model objects say, codeIEnumerableltModelStateTest.Models.DataObjectgtcode, and I have multiple forms on the view  one for each model object in the collection  then posting any one of those forms causes ALL of the forms to reflect the values from the particular object that was edited.p  pI understand emwhyem it does this if you do some serverside validation or processing, and it fails, you dont want to throw away all the users changes and revert to what was previously stored in the database. What I dont know is how to manage this behavior on a page with forms bound to multiple objects.p  pHeres some sample code that demonstrates the behavior. If you click any of the Save buttons, all three forms then reflect whatever field values were in the form you saved. Id like for that to emnotem happen I want only the row that was saved to reflect the posted form variables.

Instead I want to deference the pointer so I can access a node it is pointing to which is what I did in the second code snippet p  hr  pdata next lt current  p  hr  pSo now I am thinking that pointers act differently when you initialize them  you can directly declare a pointer to a memory address when you initialize it by using the operator but you could no longer do this after initialization. Thats pretty odd..p  pAm I right or is there something else going on p

Negative 58679 pLets say I have a method that throws an Exception of some kind. The exceptionthrowing code lies in a thirdparty library that access an external service. I have a few classes that do a good deal of work with external services and there is a LOT of exception handling throughout to deal with potential problems. The issue Im hitting is that I may have a lot of exceptions, but I may only need to perform one of a few actions if there is one, and there are a ton of trycatch blocks peppered about. The type of exception may not even be relevant, or different methods may throw the same type of exception, but different actions need to be taken depending on the method throwing it.p  pWhat Im looking for is an annotation that can supplant trycatch and simply dictate the behavior to be taken when there is an exception in that method. I know that Spring ApsectJ can do this sort of thing, but Im not currently able to easily add any new dependencies or modify the pom to adjust existing ones. As such, Im hoping that this can be accomplished with a custom annotation. For examplep  precodeCatcheractionSomeEnum.SOMEACTION public void doSomethingServiceObj obj throws SomeException      ExternalService.makeThingsHappenobj  codepre  pI would presume that a separate class would handle exceptions, of course. An additional difficulty is that I would need the ServiceObj that is passed as well. If makeThingsHappen fails, I may need obj to perform additional actions. The action variable will tell the handler class what to do with obj.p  pCan this be done without severe muckery, or am I hoping for something that may not existp

Each tick I compared the last state with actual data by traversing data structure, detecting changed parts and building delta. Its an ideal approach from usage convenience but even optimized to cache all reflection calls except FieldType.GetValueSetValue still provides poor performance because data structure is too large for this frequency. Half the time I spend in GetValue and the rest traversing a hierarchical structure. The problem is Im bound to structure size and need to traverse all fields each time despite changes happen not so often.p

Negative 58679 pI have a JMS publisher, which I cannot change external system. This publisher publishes messages into some predefined JMS queue. I would like to design a multinode subscriber system in which all subscribing nodes will receive a copy of each message in my design, a subscriber node is able to realize if the message is targeted at this node by checking some property inside the message, so only one subscriber node will eventually process the message, while other subscriber nodes will discard their copies. p  pChanging the publisher system to use Topics could work flawlessly, but I cannot change the publisher.p  pCurrently, I see two options to solve thisp  ol lipOne option which can probably work is to use QueueBrowser, implement periodic polling which will read all messages and if the message is mine, remove the message from queue and process. This is a huge overhead for such a simple problem.pli lipAnother option is to write a dispatcher which subscribes to the queue and dispatches each message to multiple internal subscribers e.g. as explained here a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions4615744jmsgoingfromonetomultipleconsumersJMS  Going from one to multiple consumersa. But this creates bottleneck in the dispatcher killing the whole scalability idea.pli lipA third option is to have multiple intermediate queue subscribers, each subscriber, when it receives a message, republishes it to a Topic for which the target subscribers will subscribe. This can work, but its an extra hop in the flow, so not sure if the benefit scalability will be worth the loss latency and complexity.pli ol  pI wonder if there are any other ideas on how to solve this. p  ul liCan I have a subscriber listening to strongall topicsstrong li liCan I configure JMS WebLogic in my case to autoforward messages from queue to some topicli liOther optionsli ul  pThanks.p

Negative 58679 pIm finishing up a project and a requirement is twoway handshaking between functional units inside our processor. I know what it is but is there any standard or a good simple example of itp  pOnly thing I can think of between two units, when theres a dataline between them and when X sends to Y, a separate sent signal is given. When Y receives a received signal is sent to X on another wire. Once X reads that received signal it stops sending data on the dataline and sets sent wire to 0 or Z. Y then sets received signal to 0 or Z as well.p  pThis is all synchronous on the same clock.p  pIs this a valid way to go about this I figure it can get very messy on a large scale but Im only working on a simple accumulator based processor.p

Negative 58679 pIve been perplexed for a while, whether to run the rendering loop in an endless loop or whether to drive it with a timer say, a 60 Hz timer. The endless loop seems a good idea, but I am worried it might leech a battery on portable devices faster than the timer approach. In general, consume more energy. Ive seen both approaches used in practice, but cant decide on the positive and negative points of them. Can you please help me decide Perhaps most portable devices are too primitive to support codeVSynccode updates and hence timer use on them is necessaryp

Negative 58679 pConsidering that codeidljcode is a tool implementing a transform in which an OMG IDL input can be transformed to a Java source code output, is there a converse transform, and a corresponding tool available, something with which IDL could be generated from Java source codep  pI ask out of the interest of developing an IDL mapping for JCR. Given the source code of the JCR reference model in JSR283, if it would be possible to generate IDL for so many interfaces and exception types as are defined in that source code, it could simply the task considerably  thus somewhat simplifying the task of making JCR available to nonJava client applications, albeit then incorporating the CORBA architecture, in its relative complexity. p  pIf there is not such a tool, though Im not sure Id be prepared to be design an IDL generator for Java, but if such a tool was designed, certainly then it could serve to simplify the IDL for JCR definition task, considerably, p

Negative 58679 pmy problem is the following p  pI want to use Googles Cloud Messaging server to send a push notification to a user, when he got challenged.p  pChallenging means, that another user writes an ID into a text field and presses a button. If he presses the button, the app saves the Challenger ID and Challengee ID into a hashma. This Hashmap gets sent to a PHP Server.

Negative 58679 pIn a nutshell, I have a customer who wants the data contained in a bunch of ASCII text files a.k.a input files ingested into Accumulo.p  pThese files are output from diverse data feed devices and will be generated continuously on nonHadoopnonAccumulo nodes a.k.a feed nodes. The overall data throughput rate across all feeds is expected to be very high.p  pFor the sake of simplicity, assume that all the data will end up in one forward index table and one inverted [reverse] index table in Accumulo.p  pIve already written an Accumulo client module using pyaccumulo that can establish a connection to Accumulo through the Thrift Proxy, read and parse the input files from a local filesystem not HDFS, create the appropriate forward and reverse index mutations in code, and use BatchWriter to write the mutations to the forward and reverse index tables. So far, so good. But theres more to it.p  pFrom various sources, Ive learned that there are at least a few standard approaches for Accumulo high speed ingest that might apply in my scenario, and Im asking for some advice regarding what options make the most sense in terms of resource usage, and ease of implementation amp maintenance. Here are some optionsp  ol liBatchWriter clients on feed nodes Run my Accumulo client on the feed nodes. This option has the disadvantage sending both forward and reverse index mutations across the network. Also, AccumuloThrift libraries need to be available on the feed nodes to support the Accumulo client. However, this option has the advantage that it parallelizes the work of parsing the input files and creating the mutations, and seems to minimize disk IO on the Hadoop cluster compared with the options below.li liBatchWriter client on Accumulo master node scpsftp the input files from the feed nodes to the Accumulo master node, into some directory on the local filesystem. Then run my Accumulo client on the Accumulo master node only. This option has the advantage that it doesnt send both forward and reverse index mutations across the network from the feed nodes to the Accumulo master node, and it doesnt require the AccumuloThrift libraries to be available on the feed nodes. However, it has the disadvantage that it makes the Accumulo master node do all the work of parsing the input files and creating the mutations, and it uses the Accumulo masters local disk as a waypoint for the input files.li liMapReduce with AccumuloOutputFormat scpsftp the input files from the feed nodes to the Accumulo master node. Then periodically copy them to HDFS and run a MapReduce job that reads and parses the input files from HDFS, creates the mutations, and uses AccumuloOutputFormat to write them. This option has the advantages of 2 above, plus it parallelizes the work of parsing the input files and creating the mutations. However, it has the disadvantage that its going to constantly spin up and break down MapReduce jobs, and invoke all the overhead involved with those processes. It also has the disadvantage that it uses two disk waypoints local and HDFS with associated disk IO. It sounds somewhat painful to implement and maintain for continuous ingest.li liMapReduce with AccumuloOutputFileFormat rfiles scpsftp the input files from the feed nodes to the Accumulo master node. Then periodically copy them to HDFS and run a MapReduce job that reads and parses the input files from HDFS, creates the mutations, and uses AccumuloOutputFileFormat to write rfiles. Then use the Accumulo shell to ingest the rfiles. This option has all the advantages of 3 above, but I dont know if it has other advantages Does it The Accumulo manual states about bulk ingest In some cases it may be faster to load data this way rather than via ingesting through clients using BatchWriters. What cases. It also has all the disadvantages of 3 above, except that it uses three disk waypoints local, HDFSx2 with associated disk IO. It sounds painful to implement and maintain for continuous ingest.li ol  pPersonally, I like option 2 the most, as long as the Accumulo master node can handle the processing load involved on its own nonparallel input file parsing. The variant of 2 where I could run my Accumulo client on each Accumulo node, and send the output of different feed nodes to different Accumulo nodes, or roundrobin, still has the disadvantage of sending the forward and reverse index mutations across the cloud network to the Accumulo master, but does have the advantage of performing the input file parsing more in parallel.p  pWhat I need to know is Have I missed any viable options Have I missed any advantagesdisadvantages of each option Are any of the advantagesdisadvantages trivial or highly important regardless of my problem context, especially network bandwidth  CPU cycle  disk IO tradeoffs Is MapReduce with or without rfiles worth the trouble compared to BatchWriter Does anyone have war storiesp  pThanksp

Negative 58679 pI can successfully intercept the codeActionBarcode home button from my codeNavigationDrawerFragmentcode, which is added to my codeMainActivitycode, like sop  precodeOverride public boolean onOptionsItemSelectedMenuItem item      if loggedIn ampamp item.getItemId  android.R.id.home          login         return true          return super.onOptionsItemSelecteditem  codepre  pHowever, in my codeComposeActivitycode with codeComposeFragmentcode this does not work. codeonOptionsItemSelectedcode is not called on the fragment.p  pI have debugged the code and the issue seems to come down to the design of the Android support library. It appears that both codeFragmentActivitycode and codeActivitycode have their own references to a codeFragmentManagercode.p  pcodeFragmentActivitycode first checks if codeActivitycode can handle the event before checking any of its fragments, which is consistent with the a hrefhttpdeveloper.android.comguidetopicsuiactionbar.htmlActionEvents relnofollowdocsap  precode   Dispatch context and options menu to fragments.   Override public boolean onMenuItemSelectedint featureId, MenuItem item      if super.onMenuItemSelectedfeatureId, item          return true           switch featureId          case Window.FEATUREOPTIONSPANEL             return mFragments.dispatchOptionsItemSelecteditem          case Window.FEATURECONTEXTMENU             return mFragments.dispatchContextItemSelecteditem          default             return false       codepre  pAs seen in the snippet below, codeActivitycode handles the home button as a last resort, after checking if either it or any of its fragments can handle the event. But this reference to codeFragmentManagercode does not contain any fragments, the fragments are in the codeFragmentActivitycodes manager. Therefore the event will get swallowed by the codeActivitycode class if codeActionBar.DISPLAYHOMEASUPcode is set.p  precodepublic boolean onMenuItemSelectedint featureId, MenuItem item       ...      if onOptionsItemSelecteditem          return true          if mFragments.dispatchOptionsItemSelecteditem          return true          if item.getItemId  android.R.id.home ampamp mActionBar  null ampamp             mActionBar.getDisplayOptions amp ActionBar.DISPLAYHOMEASUP  0          if mParent  null              return onNavigateUp          else              return mParent.onNavigateUpFromChildthis                   return false      ...   codepre  pIt turns out that my codeMainActivitycode, being the root of my application and using a navigation drawer, did not have this flag set and so did not swallow the event. But my codeComposeActivitycode has a parent activity and I need this flag to be set so it is not possible to intercept the action bar home button.p  blockquote   pstrongTo sum up the issuestrong It is not possible to intercept a click on the   Action Bar home button from a fragment in an activity with with   DISPLAYHOMEASUP set.p blockquote  pstrongSo is this a bug in the support librarystrong It doesnt look like it would occur if I targeted a later Android version and dropped the support library.p  pRegarding workarounds for this, I guess I couldp  ul liIn my codeComposeActivitycodes codeonOptionsItemSelectedcode I can manually pass the event to each of my fragments, seeing if they can handle it before calling super.li liOverride onMenuItemSelected in codeComposeActivitycode and do the same thing.li ul  pAnybody encountered this before Should I log a bug somewhere Any other ideas of ways around this issuep

Negative 58679 pConsider the following codep  precodelseekfd, 100, 0  Seek to the 100th byte in the file fd.  writefd, buf, n  Write from that position.  lseekfd, 0, 0  Is this necessary Will it trigger a actual disk movement  codepre  pId like to codelseekcode back to the beginning of the file, in case another line of code continues writing from that position thinking that it starts at the beginning of the file. First, is this good practice Second...p  pId like to know if an codelseekcode does trigger an actual disk movement. Or, is the disk movement triggered only in the event of an actual reading or writing.p  pDisk seeking is a huge performance hit, and Id like to know the tradeoffs between such defensive coding practices and performance.p

The skeleton for the input field is there, but it doesnt do anything since I have no ActionListener and dont exactly know what to put into ActionListener to allow the user to input a value. Any help would be greatly appreciated.

According to codestracecode and common sense, codeclosecode should be called for file descriptors 1 and 2 as well. If I run codecat code and cat all the files in the directory, I see Closing fd 3, Closing fd 4, etc. up to the last file in the directory. Since all of these file descriptors are greater than 2, I thought maybe there was an issue with closing the special file descriptors stdout and stderr. However, when I run codelscode I only see the regular output and no Closing fd lines, which means it didnt work for codelscode either, even though codestracecode shows codeclose3code when running codelscode.p  pAny ideas on what could be wrongp

For example, this approach allows the following invalid entities, where a single entity has aliases in other tenantsp  pre   Tenant    Entity ID  Entity Alias    tenantA  entity1   entitya       tenantB  entity1   entityb       pre  h2Option 4h2  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comaQgYc.jpg altOption 4p  pThis approach will allow for the seemingly appropriate design of Option 1, but uses Oracle materialized views to effectively join the tables and allow uniqueness constraints to be applied between them. This approach seems to work, although I dont have any past experience with materialized views, so I may need to do some further testing to ensure that Im not overlooking any other problems. The known downsides are that this is Oraclespecific and materialized views do have some inherent downsides such as requiring additional disk space and presumably having some effect on the performance of insertsupdates since the view would also need to be updated.p  h2Option 5h2  pOption 5 would be to use either Option 1 or Option 3 along with some triggers to enforce the missing requirements. Id prefer not to use triggers if possible as these can also be a bit heavy, may be DBMSspecific, and are unlikely to be the most efficient way to manage the requirements.p  h2Summaryh2  pOn the surface, this doesnt seem like it should be a unique or difficult problem to solve, yet none of the options feels quite appropriate. At this point, Im leaning toward emOption 2em or maybe emOption 3em, but Im not convinced yet. Is there a straightforward option or perhaps a solution that Im overlooking p
Negative 58679 pSo... I have a Nav bar hover event. Whenever I add it to the last section of the navbar if goes down and goes to the left...

Negative 58679 pImagine the following categories bars, places to eat, shops, etc...  p  pEach of these categories will have some common fields, such as p  precodeid, name, address and geolocation Lat and Lng position.   codepre  pI am strongly in doubt whether I should create one table that combines these different categories, or whether I should split it up into separate tables 1 table per category.  p  pMy thought is that retrieving places based on category and geolocation for each category table separately would be faster in both retrieval and update, certainly when the number of places per category increases.  p  pFrom this approach, I would go for 1 table per category.  p  pBUT there is a supplementary requirement. Every place will have an owner user, and one user could own multiple places. So this means that I would either  p  ul liNeed a manytomany table that connects the user table with the central giant table li liNeed one manytomany table for each of the categories.  li ul  pSecond BUT the situation is, that when the user logs in, all places that this user owns will be returned from a single query, ie. the id  name, assuming that a user could be the owner of multiple places.br From this point of view, the second option seems a very bad idea, because it appears that I would need to create queries to scan through each of the tables.br I realize that I can use indexes to speed up long table scans, yet I am still uncertain about the performance when the number of places would increase dramatically, and there are currently about 8 different categories.  p  pWhat do you consider the most optimal solution, based on the options that I proposed or do you see a better option Im missing out on.br I should point out that the web application will not often mix up categories, although bars will be able to create events as well.  p  pThe answer to this question is invaluable to me, because it will define the fundaments for the further development of my application.br Let me know if anything in my question is not clear to you. p  pThank you. p

Negative 58679 pI am using a pandas DataFrame to store data from a series of experiments so that I can easily make cuts across various parameter values for the next stage of analysis. I have a few questions about how to do this most effectively.p  pCurrently I create my DataFrame from a dictionary of lists. There is typically a few thousand rows in the DataFrame. One of the columns is a deviceid which indicates which of the 20 devices that the experimental data pertains to. Other columns include info about the experimental setup, like temperature, power, etc. and measurement results, like resonantfrequency, bandwidth, etc.p  pSo far, Ive been using this DataFrame rather naively, that is, I use it sort of like a numpy record array, and so I dont think Im fully taking advantage of the power of the DataFrame.

Negative 58679 pIve found a lot of discussion about loop invariant values and whether to declare them outside the loop or not. That is not what Im concerned about. Im concerned about loop emvariantem values and whether declaring them explicitly has any potential performance implications.p  pA coworker recently sent out a piece of code. Lets say T is a sequence of integers, be it list, vector, etc.p  precodeinclude lttime.hgt include ltalgorithmgt  template lttypename Tgt clockt checkT ampcont, int cnt      clockt starttime  clock      srand27     while cnt              int cur  rand ltlt 10  rand         cont.insertstdfindifcont.begin, cont.end, [cur]int i  return i gt cur , cur          return clock  starttime  codepre  pWhen I saw this code I immediate thought that I would change while loop top  precode    Titerator it  stdfindifcont.begin, cont.end, [amp]int i              return i gt cur          cont.insertit, cur codepre  pSo basically, I would capture cur by reference, split the line into two parts, and some minor formatting differences. I dont think theres any potential performance downsides as far as the reference is concerned, but let me know if Im wrong. What about the iterator I prefer this because I think it more clearly illustrates the process, but am I accidentally making another temporary or taking away optimization opportunitiesp  pI know what youre all going to say, profile and dont optimize prematurely. I know, I believe. The problem is that I come across the situation of declaring temporary variables in loops very frequently, and the variable may not be an iterator. What if its a pointer, or some data structure that requires a deep copy What if the function call gets this variable by reference to const versus value It would be nice to have some insight on the theoretical implications so I can do it the right way immediately and not have to test all the time.p  pSo, is there any downside to explicitly declaring temporary variables before they are used Or does the compiler make these two completely equivalent Maybe people like the fact that the first example is one line and mine is fivep  pEDIT I forgot to explain why I thought of this. C Coding Standards, 101 Rules, Guidelines, and Best Practices by Sutter and Alexandrescu says in Item 9 that It is not a premature optimization to reduce spurious temporary copies of objects, especially in inner loops, when doing so doesnt impact code complexity. Is this what theyre talking aboutp

Negative 58679 pIve a custom Entity class see code below. The objects of this class get populated into a Dictionary collection codeDictionaryltstring, Dictionary ltuint,Entitygtgt dtcode .

Negative 58679 pwhat I am trying to achieve in Java is to be able to paint random shapes from another method without having to have those shapes already drawn from the start user picks x, y, w, h themselvesp  pHere is what I have so farp  precodepublic class Design extends JComponent  private static final long serialVersionUID  1L  public void paintGraphics g      super.paintComponentg   public void drawRectint xPos, int yPos, int width, int height      Graphics g  null     g.drawRectwidth, height, xPos, yPos   codepre  pAs you can see above, I have the drawRect function coded but do not understand how to make it so when I call the drawRect function, it gets the paint function to draw a rectangle instead which is EXACTLY what the paint function does, inside it, you type g.drawRect and your x,y,w,h. The reason why I am doing this and not just straight up using paint is because im trying to make a component so instead of having to type out the paint function everytime, I just add this class to my Swing and its done.p  pHope you understand what Im trying to achieve here.

Negative 58679 pIm having an issue whenever I call glGenBuffers on windows. Whenever I call glGenBuffers, or any 3.2 or above functions, OpenGL returns an INVALIDOPERATION error. After reading around the web this is probably being caused by not having the updated function pointer for 3.2 on windows. From everything I have read you must acquire the function pointers at runtime by asking the windows API codewglGetProcAddresscode to return the function pointer for use in your program and your current driver. This in itself isnt hard, but why reinvent the wheel. Instead I choose to include GLEW to handle the function pointers for me.p  pHere is a small program to demonstrate my issue.p  precodedefine GLEWSTATIC include ltGLglew.hgt include ltGLFWglfw3.hgt include ltiostreamgt   void PrintErrorvoid       Print glGetError   int main        glfwInit     glfwWindowHintGLFWCONTEXTVERSIONMAJOR, 3     glfwWindowHintGLFWCONTEXTVERSIONMINOR, 2     glfwWindowHintGLFWOPENGLFORWARDCOMPAT,GLTRUE     glfwWindowHintGLFWRESIZABLE, GLFALSE      GLFWwindow window  glfwCreateWindow800, 600, OpenGL, nullptr, nullptr     glfwMakeContextCurrentwindow     PrintError       Initalize GLEW     glewExperimental  GLTRUE     GLenum error  glewInit     iferror GLEWOK         stdcerr ltlt glewGetErrorStringerror ltlt stdendl        Glew information     ifGLEWVERSION32         stdcout ltlt Supports 3.2.. ltlt stdendl       Try buffer     GLuint buffer     glGenBuffers1,ampbuffer  INVALIDOPERATION     PrintError  Error shows up        This is our main loop     whileglfwWindowShouldClosewindow              glfwSwapBufferswindow         glfwPollEvents          glfwTerminate     return 0  codepre  pWhen I run the following code I get an OpenGL windows.

Negative 58679 pThe C keyword mutable lets us have nonconst members in const objects. This raises the question, what why, which has already been addressed on SO.p  pa hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions105014doesthemutablekeywordhaveanypurposeotherthanallowingthevariabletoDoes the 39mutable39 keyword have any purpose other than allowing the variable to be modified by a const functionap  pThe chosen answer is that the correct usage for mutable is to signify logical const as opposed to bitwise const. Several other questions and answers on SO raise the same point. I like these answers emconceptuallyem, but do they mean anythingp  pTheres no mechanism in C to enforce logical const while allowing bitwise mutability that I know of. To take the idea at face value, using mutable would require compilers to deduce whether any possible write to a mutable member could ever cause the equality operator to evaluate false, which is just silly.p  pHerb Sutters blog does confirm that logical const is at least the emintentem of mutable.p  pa hrefhttpherbsutter.com20130524gotw6aconstcorrectnesspart13 relnofollowhttpherbsutter.com20130524gotw6aconstcorrectnesspart13ap  p Similarly, writing mutable on a member variable means what it has always meant The variable is writable but logically const. p  pIs this any more than an intention The standard itself is quite terse about mutable and I could not find a definition for logically const.p  pIs there emeverem a case where a write to a mutable member of a const object that violates logically const is anything more than an aesthetically displeasing designp

Negative 58679 pI am trying to understand how to migrate an strongopenidstrong server to an strongopenid connectstrong but while reading more about the strongopenid connectstrong flow, I notice that for the emclientsem or emrelay partiesem things are now more complicated.p  pWhile in strongopenidstrong after performing the a hrefhttpopenid.netspecsopenidconnectdiscovery10.html relnofollowdiscoverya, the exchange between emauthentication serverem from the client side, can be totally stateless dumb mode, now with strongopenid connectstrong the client would need a codeclientidcode and a codeclientsecretcode and some how store that information, this because of the a hrefhttpoauth.net2 relnofollowoauth2a flow.p  pIf I am right, this implies that every time an authentication needs to be made, a dynamic registration will need to be performed in case the server  application doesnt have an codeclientidcode amp codeclientidcode.p  pFrom my understanding, with strongopenidstrong an application in order to get access, can follow an stateless flow, and basically just strongtruststrong the reply from the authentication server, simple as that, emno need to sign a contract firstem to later trust as in  strongopenid connectstrong happens. p  pstrongopenidstrong seems to be more versatile than strongopenid connectstrong but maybe I am totally wrong, therefore I would like to know any best practices about how to simplify the migration process. Or maybe just continue to use strongopenidstrong as always and consider strongopenid connectstrong as a totally different alternative. p

Negative 58679 pI have a dropdown whose selected values determines what values are displayed for a group of radio buttons.  I am using jquery .get to an mvc5 controller that returns a partial view containing the radio buttons.  This works fine.  However, when I try to submit the form, the model field for the radio button never binds to the model property.  The other fields on the form bind correctly.  I examined the code via view source and I can see where the name property for the element has a binding of NameControlName instead of NameViewModel.Child.ControlName as the other form element names have.  What is a way to get binding to occur when you are dynamically adding a field to the form  What is the recommended way of handling this scenariop

While main thread waits, second thread is sleeping 5 seconds and then calls setState method. This changes state variable to zero, and calls notify what unlocks waiting in main process. That seems to make sense, but the question is How the hell it is possible that second thread executes setState when on the same time main thread is inside waitForComplete method. Both methods are synchronized, so it should be impossible to execute them simultaneously.p

Now the codeassertcode is correct, the test fails.p  pWhen debugging, I find that the codeuploadcode variable in the test is something like codeltRackTestUploadedFile0x007f85ca141c50gtcode. However, when I debug the controller, the value in the codeparamscode hash is codeltRackTestUploadedFile0x007f85ca141c50gtcode.p  pNote the quote marks. Rails has turned the file upload into a stringp  pSince theres none of my code between the test and the controller, and this works when the app is run in the browser, I guess something may be wrong with how I am constructing the params hash or the tempfile itself in the test.p  pAny ideas what I am doing wrongp

Negative 58679 pI am trying to write a code for which I need multiple arrays of different data types. These arrays need to be dynamically allocated. I need to consider the performance so I want to allocate all the arrays with one codemalloccode call.p  pFor simple case, lets say I need one integer and one double precision floating point array. So, I am doing the following.p  precodeint iA double dA void vp vp  malloc sizeofintsizeofdoubleN   assume N is known at this point.   now to set the array pointers I am doing the following. iA  vp dA  voidiAN  This is wrong ... freevp codepre  pIf address in vp is multiple of 8 which usually is and N is an odd number, dA is set to an address that is not a multiple of 8. This causes all sorts of problem. It should be fine if I interchange iA and dA assignment. This seems a simple solution but if I have more than two arrays and more than two different types, it might not solve the issue. I am not sure.p  pSo, my question is, what is the best way in terms of performance to allocate memory if you need multiple array of different data typesp  pNOTE I am on a 64bit Linux machine, compiling code with gcc4.9.0.p

Negative 58679 pMy understanding is correct me if Im wrong or inaccurate please that when you delete data say, a whole row from a MySQL table, the file size of the database file does not shrink.

The line of code that alerts Inside Mock is indeed being alerted, so I know my mock thing that I assigned to executeSearch is being set up properly. However, the code inside the .then block is not being alerted, so my promise must not be resolved or something... p
Negative 58679 pI was thinking to fit my Perl application into the hadoop architecture. The application runs a set of processing blocks on billions of datasets.

Negative 58679 pI am trying to scrape data from a website which is unfortunately located on a very unreliable sever which has very volatile reaction times. The first idea is of course to loop over the list of thousands of URLs and saving the downloaded results by populating a list.p  pThe problem however is that the server randomly responds very slowly which results into a timeout error. This alone would not be a problem as I can use the codetryCatchcode function and jump to the next iteration. Doing so I am however missing some files in each run. I know that each of the URLs in the list exists and I need all of the data. p  pMy idea thus would have been to use codetryCatchcode to evaluate if the codegetURLcode request yields and error. If so the loop jumps to the next iteration and the erroneous URL is appended at the end of the URL list over which the loop runs. My intuitive solution would look something like this   p  precodedwl  list  for i in seqalongurs   temp  tryCatchgetURLurlurs[[i]],errorfunctionee  ifinheritstemp,OPERATIONTIMEDOUT check for timeout error urs[[lengthurs1]]   urs[[i]] if there is one the erroneous url is appended at the end of the sequence  next else  dwl[[i]]  temp if there is no error the data is saved in the list   codepre  pIf it would work I would eventually be able to download all the URLs in the list. It however doesnt work, because as the help page for the codenextcode function states emseq in a for loop is evaluated at the start of the loop changing it subsequently does not affect the loopem. Is there a workaround for this or a trick with which I could achieve my envisaged goal I am grateful for every comment p

Although, Ive notice that for a pacing different from 1, the list listx gets messed up and a value goes right to the end of it. Here follows the complete codep  precodeimport java.util.ArrayList import java.util.List import java.util.Scanner public class Integrate      static ListltDoublegt fillxdouble ini,double end, double pace  Fills the x column         ListltDoublegt listx  new ArrayListltDoublegt         fordouble i  ini i lt end0.1pace i  pace             int i2  int iinipace            listx.addi2, i                  System.out.printlnlistx         return listx          static ListltListltDoublegtgt fillyListltDoublegt listx Fills the y column         ListltListltDoublegtgt listxy new ArrayListltListltDoublegtgt         forint i  0 i lt listx.sizei              ListltDoublegt pair  new ArrayListltDoublegt             pair.add0,listx.geti             pair.add1,functionlistx.geti             listxy.addi,pair             System.out.printlnpair                  return listxy          static double functiondouble x  Defines the function to be integrated     return x          static double integrateListltListltDoublegtgt listxy  Integrates following trapezoidal forms         double area  0         forint i0 i1 lt listxy.sizei             area  0.5listxy.geti1.get0listxy.geti.get0      listxy.geti1.get1listxy.geti.get1            System.out.printlnlistxy.geti1.get0 listxy.geti.get0 listxy.geti1.get1 listxy.geti.get1                  return area          public static void mainString[] args          Scanner scan  new ScannerSystem.in         double ini  scan.nextDouble Reads the inferior limit         double end  scan.nextDouble Reads the superior limit         double pace  scan.nextDouble Reads the pace partial to be summed.         if endini  pace lt pace          System.out.printlnintegratefillyfillxini,end,pace         else             System.out.printlnMust review pace      codepre  pAnd I get these results with values of ini  0, end  1, pace 1E1p  precode[0.0, 0.1, 0.2, 0.30000000000000004, 0.4, 0.6, 0.7, 0.7999999999999999, 0.8999999999999999, 0.9999999999999999, 0.5] codepre  pId be really glad if you had any other remarks as well.

Negative 58679 pI am working on a simple windows store app that has a codecanvascode where you are able to preview the image from the camera on the device. There is a button that enables and disables the preview as well. I was previously able to preview the codeMediaCapturecode output camera output but now that I am trying to implement a working toggle for that preview, I am running into some issues.p  pBasically, I now have the codeVisibilitycode property of the canvas that holds the preview set to codeCollapsedcode in the constructor of the codePagecode that holds it.p  precode    public MediaCap              this.InitializeComponent         capturePreviewCanvas.Visibility  Visibility.Collapsed      codepre  pThen I have the button click handler for when the user taps the preview buttonp  precode    if capturePreviewCanvas.Visibility  Visibility.Visible              capturePreviewCanvas.Visibility  Visibility.Collapsed          await mediaCaptureManager.StopPreviewAsync          else              capturePreviewCanvas.Visibility  Visibility.Visible         capturePreviewCaptureElement.Source  mediaCaptureManager         await mediaCaptureManager.StartPreviewAsync      codepre  pThe issue is that even when I debug the code and see it setting the codeVisibilitycode property of codecapturePreviewCanvascode to codeVisiblecode, the canvas never appears on the screen like it did before I defaulted it to codeCollapsedcode in the constructor.p  pIs there some UI refreshing that I need to do to get the canvas to be visible againp
Negative 58679 pIm currently drawing a line chart on a html5 canvas In plan vanilla JavaScript with a width of 1px and moving along as I draw on the x axis 2px spacing per data point. Currently my canvas size is 1000px by 300px.p  pMy data is most of the time much larger than my canvas. I need some idea of a smart approach to zooming or to make it seem like you are zooming as I would like to be able to zoom and drag the viewable area around without loosing the crispness of the 1px line.p  blockquote   pA note The canvas could be a drawing of cat for all it matters, for the sake of a clear question if it was a cat then the cat would be much larger than the canvas and you might, as a user, be interested at looking closely at its foot and scrolling around or zooming out to see the whole cat. strongThe real problem I see is the fact that it is a line drawing of 1px thicknessstrong.p blockquote  pWould it be more practical to change increasedecrease the x spacing and the magnitude of the the y movements when drawing So that this way If zoomed out far, I would be drawing still with 1px thickness and still drawing on the same size canvas but moving much more fineight distances. This way I would have to repaint I think every time I navigate the area and if altering zoom. Also the canvas would not need to be zoomed with css.p  pOr would It be better to Increase the size of the canvas to a much much larger one and change the thickness of the line with each zoom So this way when you are zoomed out the line thickness would be greater than if you were zoomed in but the distance and spacing between movements would always be the same no matter what level the zoom was. Also this way I assume I would have to repaint only when zooming the canvas element with css to change line width whereas scrolling the drawing would be fine as the whole drawing would allways fit into the large canvas.p  pI have heard that there are limitations on size and rendering on different browsers for a start and I would like to know If anyone has had any experience in dealing with large canvas drawings.p  blockquote   pFor further detail My data points are around 70,000 long I will be increasing to 100,000 data points strongso the canvas would be quite big, hence my concernstrong it is a static chart so no worries about stalling the browser with such a large task.p blockquote  pWhat would be the most doable way and would there be a more logical approach to this taskp  pPlease no librarys. p

Negative 58679 pWe all know that blocks retain objects they capture. We also know we can avoid this by passing a weak reference to an object into a block. But why it works this way To retain an object means to increase its retain count by one. Why it makes difference to pass a weak reference Being weak or strong it will still point to the same object, and this objects retain count will be increased by block. Am I right So why objects retain count doesnt get increased if we pass a weak reference to an object inside a block How does it work insidep

Negative 58679 pI am currently working on an application that allows the user to register and login via regular email and password. It also allows the user to login via Facebook. Both of these functionalities are working. p  pThe problem is that  when a user registers via email and later tries to log in via facebook  assuming heshe has the same email for facebook the application treats himher as a new user. A new record is created in the database.p  pIm new to swift and parse. I tried to take the information that comes from facebook and get the users email and compare it to the users already in parse....but then, how do I merge the two accounts If you have successfully implemented this functionality I really would appreciated if you walked me through it. p  pThank you so much. p

Negative 58679 pIm really having a lot of trouble to do something that is probably quite simple. Basically, Im trying to write a Windows Form CCLI program to read an arduino stream from a serial port and, at least initially, add each value to a listBox. The Arduino Code is ok and it gives me a string every 2 seconds, and when I debug the Windows Form with a breakpoint, I can see the value of the string variable Message coming in just fine. But I ran into this thread problem, and I understand I have to create a different thread to update the listBox... Ok. Now, what I cant find a way to do is to pass that message string to the function UpdateList. Ive seen a lot of things about passing an object, a class, and so on... But cant manage to fit it in my code.

Negative 58679 pI just released an audio version of a game for the blind and the sighted. I developed the game in CQt because thats the languageframework I know the best, and because this is my first audio game, I want to stick with what I know best.p  pI dont know if this is a problem, but even if the game is audioonly with keyboard controls, it shows a fullscreen empty mainwindow. Thats because I kinda assume writing a consoleonly game with keyboard controls without QtWidgets package is really hard.p  pSo heres my question Am I right I mean, is there an easy way to write a console game with keyboard controls with Qt Or should I just forget about it and continue showing an empty windowp

Negative 58679 pComing from strongNode.jsstrong and now working with strongJavastrong Im wondering about how to achieve with Java what I did with Node.js, more specifically How to compile my templates into JS functions.p  pWhat I did before was using EJS templates, then they were compiled into a single JS file that exposed functions to call from JS with parameters, these functions returned a HTML string that I could use as it to update my view.p  pThe great thing about this is that I could write my templates in separated files, EJS then dynamically GruntEJS I guess, thats from Sails.js internal logic was converting the template into a function, merged all of them and finally generating a single file usable in my app, I just had to call a function, provide arguments and thats it I get a view dynamically generated.p  pI want to achieve the same in a Java environment, using Ant, maybe maven, but I dont know how to do it neither where to look for since Im a Java novice.p  pEdit p  pIm talking about clientside templating, I just want to avoid the uglytraditionnal way to write HTML code inside JS strings and split them in separated files so I can maintain them easier. I only need to use them from JS, not from Java, but I need to compile them from a Java environment, using Ant. p
Negative 58679 pWe want to have a set of mutually exclusive check boxes and want to implement that logic on the client angularjs so that the user can get immediate, responsive feedback about their selection choices. Normally, mutual exclusivity would be enforced with radio buttons ensuring user familiarity with the interface selections. However, in this specific case, lets suppose that within a specific sub category, a user can select as many options as they want, but cannot select options from more than one subcategory. Imagine setting contact preferences as either No or some type of Yes. Or perhaps there is a online food order form where certain topping choices are mutually exclusive between categories.p

When I paste as values and get something like the above, the missing values show up as 0, even when going through the chart formatting options in Excel 2013 to select the gaps option for how to show missing data. p  pHowever, if I go to the blank cells and hit backspace, then enter seemingly deleting nothing, the gaps show up as desired.p  pI have verified the original cells are blank using ISBLANK and CODE.

Ugh Ive been at this for 4 hours and I am no where closer than when I started. Ive tried copying the folders in to my project several times, starting with different folder levels of the licensing source files. Each time vending is an unknown symbol.p  pI tried importing the library, but that hosed things up. vending still turned red, but now so did ActionBarActivity and I couldnt sync the gradel. AS then forced me to download a new version of the SDK BuildTools. I think it was 19.1. That didnt solve any problems. I undid all of the changes and Im back to where I started.p  pIn looking at the sample project I noticed the structure of the source files is very different and I cant figure out how to add the licensing library to my project so it looks like the sample.p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comIeM5a.png altenter image description herep  pEDIT2 I read this article a hrefhttpwww.codeproject.comTips607552HowtoaddexternallibraryfileinAndroidStudio relnofollowhttpwww.codeproject.comTips607552HowtoaddexternallibraryfileinAndroidStudioa which was specific to AS and not Eclipse. That said to add the files to the lib folder. I was to then rightclick over them and choose Add as library. Sadly, Add as library is not an option in AS 1.0.2. This did, however, make it so vending was recognized as a symbol, but now LicenseChecker and LicenseCheckerCallback are not recognized. p  pI think that might be progress, but Im not thinking I will just give the app away instead of trying to charge 99 cents for it.

Negative 58679 pDistributed System being the correct term i think.p  pAt the moment i am developing a webapp. I am developing it locally, and when it goes into Beta it will be running on one machine, a Linode server probably.p  pThe thing is, this application will be handling and processing large amounts of data based on user requests, and will have numerous scripts running fulltime in the background of the server performing data processing. There wont be a massive amount of users using this system during Beta testing, so one machine will probably have enough resources to run the application smooth enough.p  pBut i cant imagine scaling this application on machine. So probably in the future i will have to spread the application across a distributed system.p  pI have no idea what this would involve and find it hard to find simplistic material about this subject online.p  pI have ideas on how it might be divided up though. The application is consists of a PHP framework, a MySQL database and has some Python scripts that will be ran forever handling automated tasks and data processing.p  pMaybe each seperate part gets its own machine, the PHP on one machine, this is the one that handles user requests and the related processing, the database on its own machine, and the Python scripts running on their own machine.p  pBut i have absolutely no idea how this might be achievedp  pWhat i would really like is if you guys could give some simple explanations, or a general overview, of how you would divide up an application across multiple machines. Technologies involved, general concepts, anythingp  pany help or discussion greatly appreciated Thanksp
Negative 58679 pIm struggling with problem with my first winJS app. What I want to do is to update all secondary tiles created by my app in interval of a couple of hours when Internet connection is available. Ive managed to do that from my app, using a simple update button, but I cannot do that from bg task. As for now Im testing it on timezone change trigger not to wait half an hour for the result. I put simple console.log at the beginning of the bgtask to confirm that it occurs and it does, but none of the live tiles updates. What piece of information am I missing about updating secondary live tiles from bgtaskp

Negative 58679 pThis is kind of an open question for knowledge.p  pWe have a file currently CSV which contains 800.000 strings. We parse this file after loading in with string.split. Then we put that string[] into a hashtable.p  pWe have to use a hashtable due to us wanting to find specific strings in the hashtable within less then half a second see it like auto correct suggesting words as fast as i start typing them, nearly instant after each keystroke.p  pThis whole process has to run locally and on a tablet or phone. The process is taking too long as it is.p  pIs there any way we can optimize the current process Or can we change the input file like, have a prepared hashtable in a file somehow instead of the CSV so it can directly put it back in memory when loaded inp  pAny advice on speeding up this process in any way would be greatly appreciated.p  pThanks oin advance, Smileyp
Negative 58679 pThe application I am developing needs to have an infinite loop to handle business logic that is completely separate from user input they would only view it.  Since this is a break from tradition MVC, I thought an Active Job would be a good place to put it.  p  pThe logic in the loop would poll microcontrollers on the same network.  I have little to no ability to change the code on these so I have to adapt to the unique protocol they are using. When the microcontrollers respond, the server will need to do some calculations and store those in the database.  p  pThe job would be launched when the server application is.  Only one instance of it should exist so I dont want to put it in my models or controllers.  I have tried launching it from a couple of places in the config folder but it would cause an initialized constant NameError. p  pWhat would be the correct way to launch a job when the server is initialized  Is there another approach you would takep  pI am a webdev newb using Ruby 2.2.0 and Rails 4.2.0.p
Negative 58679 pIve had a C desktop application developed for a customer that basically simplifies a Magento back end down to just the functionality she needs, as she found Magento too complicated. She uses an older mac, however, so running the tool in a VM proved to be too laggy. p  pIm thus looking to host it in the cloud, but have been somewhat overwhelmed by the options available. From my research, Amazon EC2 with XenApp installed via the Amazon Marketplace seems to be a recommended choice. Would you agree Ive looked into AppHarbor as well, but unless Im wrong I dont think theyre able to host desktop apps. p  pThe only potential constraints are that the application needs to make outbound connections over HTTP to the Magento back end and it also issues outbound SQL calls direct to the Magento database. In addition, its only for one user so the cheaper the better.p  pThanksp

Negative 58679 pI am trying to codeUPDATEcode a table and replace codeNULLcode values but with certain conditions. I created an example below and order it by cases to help illustrate where my conditions apply.p  p1  In case there is a codeNULLcode value it is supposed to replace with the previous known value. CASE 13p  p2  When there are two consecutive codeNULLcode and the codeIDcode changes.

Negative 58679 pI have some text content that I am capturing from a thirdparty source, and which sometimes contains emoji, represented as image elements. I find each of the emoji image elements, and convert them to the unicode character for that emoji using the following codep  precodethis.findimg.emoji.eachfunctioni     emoji  decodeURIComponentthis.datatextvalue     this.replaceWithemoji  codepre  pHowever, the text immediately preceding each emoji image element contains an extra whitespace character, right before the emoji. Seep  precode[...] blah blah blah  ltimg classemoji datatextvalueF09F9892gt codepre  pbut it should bep  precode[...] blah blah blah ltimg classemoji datatextvalueF09F9892gt codepre  pBecause this is coming from a thirdparty source, I have no control over the original copy. But, I would like to remove that extra whitespace character in each instance of an emoji image whether before or after converting it to unicode doesnt matter, but  I suspect it may be easier to do before. How do I accomplish thisp  pOne idea I had was to possibly get the character location of the beginning of the image element using javascripts codestr.indexOfcode, and then delete the character that was 1 less than that. But that would require converting the parent element to a string, and would cause problems if the intial text itself contained the phrase codeltimgcode, as unlikely as that would be.p  pIs there an easy way to do this that I am missingp

Negative 58679 pIm now two weeks into learning and building an codeAngularJScode codePHPcodesystem and Im still struggling with authentication. Ive been reading a lot of posts about codeAngularJScodeand not one of them seem to consider the security aspect of authentication. I also had an interesting response when I asked about the security of codeAngularJScode storages on another post, and got two great links to Stormpaths blogs which cover areas of security when dealing with codetokenscode. p  pMost tutorials and examples about codeAngularJScode seem to be taking a codeJWTcode approach and sending that token to your codeREST APIcode via codeHTTP headerscode, but given that the token is stored in Javascript this can expose it to multiple attack types. One of them being MITM. To be secure against this type of attack the solution is to set a cookie with HttpOnly and Secure flags. Now the token gets passed on every request, its not being stored by Javascript and its secure. However, this raises the question at the point where you authenticate the user strongHow is this any different than using sessions when youre only dealing with HTTP requests originating from the same serverstrong p  pWhen checking if a user has already logged in we usually check if a codeSESSIONcode variable exists, lets say codeuidcode. Now on a token based approach we send the token in codeHTTP headerscode and read that token, then validate it and get user information. In codeAngularJScodewe then get the successful response and return a promise.p  pSessions have the advantage of being handled by the server. They create a session and they handle its destruction automatically if it still lingers there. When dealing with a token based authentication you have to take care of its expiration, refreshing and destruction with a scheduled script if the user has  not destroyed it himself. This seems like too much work.p

Negative 58679 pI have a dgrid with a permanently hidden column that needs to be there, because I need to filter the table on its values. I am using ColumnHider in order to hide it and it works fine. p  pHowever, using ColumnHider also shows the small  button in the table corner that is used to hideshow columns, and I really dont want that button to show hidingshowing columns is not a functionality we need to offer. I know I can use the unhideable property on the column, but this simply removes them from the menu. Even if I set all columns as unhideable, the button is still there with an empty menu.p  pApart from hiding it with CSS, which I did, is there a way to tell ColumnHider not to show that menu at allp  pThanks, regards.p

If you uninstall the first app, the second apps   authenticator will be called from now on since its the only one   now.p blockquote  pWhen I run one of the apps no matter which app and call codeaddAccountcode it shows the signin page well. strongThen, when I run the second app and call codeaddAccountcode nothing happens and signin page is not shown.

Negative 58679 pI want to create an entity, and within the transaction trigger an codeAsynccode method to perform some changes on the same entity.

Negative 58679 pPlanning on building a fairly sophisticated app on Parse and really need some advice before I go ahead and create it...p  pI have a class called Events which stores a Time, Name and Date of Events. I thien allow the user creating the event to invite as many PFUsers as that user would like. Since this could be many I was thinking of using a PFRelation table as I guess that is the way to go with relating many Users to one parse object.p  pWhat I am worried about is being able to then let that user know that they have been invited to that event,p  pBecause if I were one of the users getting invited, would I have to query every single event ever created for a match that returns my name Hmm, I guess thinking about it, if I have a friend system it really wouldnt be THAT many events to query.p  pIs there a more efficient or better way to do thisp  pCan I use cloud code to query and notify users when they are invitedp  pAny help would be awesome..

Negative 58679 pMy site is structured pretty typically, paths likep  precodehome homesearch categories categoriesmisc codepre  pWhat I need to happen is to have a dynamic set of prefixes put on the path and have it map to the same place, and more importantly, have that prefix kept throughout the site. The prefix wont always be there, but when its there, it needs to be kept.p  pFor example, I want codeclient1program1homecode to map to the same controller actionview as codehomecode, and if theres a link on codehomecode that references codeUrl.Contentcode or codeUrl.Actioncategoriescode, the generated URL needs to keep the codeclient1program1code prefix of the request, for example in the latter case codeclient1program1categoriescode. I need that prefix to remain on every request to maintain custom functionality for that specific clientprogram. We typically manage this with subdomains and DNS, leaving paths alone, but this particular client has compliance problems with running on multiple domains.p  pThe codeclient1code part is static and can be set in code, as those change infrequently, but the codeprogram1code part is dynamic and I need to support changes there without deploying new code.p  pIve been trying to get something working with some combination of URL rewriting, routes, or a custom VirtualPathProvider, but cant seem to get it to work. Session and cookies arent really reliable enough, as they time out and can be cleared. There would be too many places to change to try to get it consistently on the query string. p  pURL rewriting strips the path info away before the application can see it. It still needs access to read what client and program it should be displaying.p  pRoutes can get the request to the right controller, but subsequent requests from that page then ignore whatever the clientprogram was.p  pA custom codeVirtualPathProvidercode feels like the most promising direction, but the underlying physical path isnt actually changing. It seems more useful for having a separate application in another directory running in the root of a site. Changing it doesnt just change all the route and path handling, it alters the ability of the engine to find views.p  pAny suggestionsp  pstrongEditstrong Routes handle paths that go through that engine, so things like codeUrl.Actioncode work okay with routes. I have other URLs that are generated from codeUrl.Contentcode, so thats probably the question Im really asking stronghow can I change what codecode maps to in codeUrl.Contentcodestrong I think thats why I started looking at codeVirtualPathProvidercode which Im now pretty sure not at all what I need. It is more focused on mapping to local physical file paths.p
