Positive 345 pCan any one help me in creating a VTK binary file for a finite element mesh data using C p  pTo be more specific, I have a 2D unstructured grid containing only quadrilaterals and at each grid node i have a density and velocity field.

Positive 345 pSo in some method, I will be opening a new IO stream, doing some processing with it, and then using that stream as the input to open up another IO stream. I dont believe I can use a single trywithresources block because of the processing with the first IO stream being in between opening the first and second streams. So with that said, would it be better in a codingdesign sense to use a single trycatchfinally block to open and close these streams or use nested trywithresources blocks to open and close the streams I know that if there is no processing between the first and second IO streams, it would be best to open all three streams in a single trywithresources block.p  pA simplistic example followsp  pstrongTryCatchFinallystrongp  precodevoid someMethodInputStream is throws SomeException     SomeIOStream io1  null    SomeIOStream io2  null    SomeIOStream io3  null     try       io1  new SomeIOStream someSortOfProcessing        io1.moreStreamProcessing       io2  new SomeIOStream someSortOfProcessingio1        io3  new SomeIOStream is       do stuff with io2 and io3     catch Throwable t        Exception Handling     finally        closing streams io3, io2, io1, is      codepre  pstrongTrywithresourcesstrongp  precodevoid someMethodInputStream is throws SomeException     try  SomeIOStream io1  new SomeIOStream someSortOfProcessing         io1.moreStreamProcessing       try  SomeIOStream io2  new SomeIOStream someSortOfProcessingio1              SomeIOStreeam io3  new SomeIOStream is              do stuff with io2 and io3            catch Throwable t        Exception Handling     finally        closing stream is      codepre  pTo me, it looks as though the first is cleaner, but the second has the benefits of a trywithresources block.

So would this third mixed approach be better than the above twop  pstrongMixed Approachstrongp  precodevoid someMethodInputStream is throws SomeException     SomeIOStream io1  null    SomeIOStream io2  null    SomeIOStream io3  null     try SomeIOStream io1  new SomeIOStream someSortOfProcessing         io1.moreStreamProcessing       io2  new SomeIOStream someSortOfProcessingio1        io3  new SomeIOStream is       do stuff with io2 and io3     catch Throwable t        Exception Handling     finally        closing streams io3, io2, is      codepre  pAlso as an additional question, am I right to assume that the only way to close the InputStream codeiscode would be to put it in the finallyblockp
Positive 345 pquestion In my Arduino  main loop, the interrupt must always enabled to process some events.  At the same time the there are heavy IO with USB port using Serial.print.  But the IO also uses interrupt.  Some times they cause conflict and hang the program, some time not.  The events are not predictable.  So what I can do is during the IO, disable the interrupt then reenable it using noInterrupts and interrupts pair for every IO.  But this is too expansive.  Any suggestionp

Positive 345 pSo I was just playing with the idea of user plugins. I wrote a simple class that prints out a String. Then I wrote an interface which requires a single method for editing that String. Now, Id like to have the user be able to insert a Jar file into a folder packaged with the program and my program reads it in, and uses it as a class which implements the interface which I created. So basically I am looking for a way of reading in a jar files contents, and using its class as one of my programs classes. Apologies in advanced for any incorrect terminology, I am very new to this. If this is the wrong way to approaching the problem let me know, Im open to a better way.

Positive 345 pCurrently Im working on loading data into a Titan graph with Hadoop Titan version 0.5.4, Hadoop version 2.6.0. Im using a singleserver pseudodistributed Hadoop cluster, with the purpose of extending to a full cluster with more machines of the same hardware. Im trying to setup Hadoop in such a way that I get full core utilization. Until now, I though I had made some decent setup with good configuration parameters, but when Hadoop is executing and loads data into the Titan graph, I dont see full utilization of all cores on my machine.p  pThe situation is as follows. The machine Im using has the following hardware specificationsp  ul liCPU 32 coresli liRAM 256GBli liSwap memory 32GBli liDrives 8x128GB SSD, 4x2TB HDDli ul  pThe data Im loading into a Titan graph with Hadoop has the following specificationsp  ul liTotal size 848MBli liSplit into four files 487MB, 142MB, 219MB and 1.6MB, each containing vertices of one single type, together with all the vertex properties and outgoing edges.li ul  pWhile setting up the Hadoop cluster, I tried to use some logic reasoning for setting the configuration parameters of Hadoop to their what I think is the optimal setting. See this reasoning below.p  ul liMy machine has 32 cores, so in theory I could split up my input size into chuncks of which the size is big enough to end up with around 32 chuncks. So, for 848MB of input, I could set codedfs.block.sizecode to 32MB, which would lead to around 848MB  32MB   27 chunks.li liIn order to ensure that each map task receives one chunck, I set the value of codemapred.min.split.sizecode to a bit less than the block size, and codemapred.max.split.sizecode to a bit more than the block size for example 30MB and 34MB, respectively.li liThe available memory needed per task is a bit vague for me. For example, I could set codemapred.child.java.optscode to a value of codeXmx1024mcode to give each task e.g. each mapperreducer 1GB of memory. Given that my machine has 256GB memory in total  subtracting some from it to reserve for other purposes leaving me around 200GB of memory  I could end up with a total of 200GB  1GB   200 mappers and reducers. Or, when I give each task 2GB of memory, I would end up with a total of 100 mappers and reducers. The amount of memory given to each task also depends on the input size, I guess. Anyway, this leads to values for codemapred.tasktracker.mapreduce.tasks.maximumcode of around 100, which might already be too much given the fact I have only 32 cores. Therefore, maybe setting this parameter to 32 for both codemapcode and codereducecode might be better What do you thinkli ul  pAfter these assumptions, I end up with the following configuration.p  pstronghdfssite.xmlstrongp  precodeltconfigurationgt   ltpropertygt     ltnamegtdfs.replicationltnamegt     ltvaluegt1ltvaluegt   ltpropertygt   ltpropertygt     ltnamegtdfs.block.sizeltnamegt     ltvaluegt33554432ltvaluegt     ltdescriptiongtSpecifies the sizeof data blocks in which the input dataset is split.ltdescriptiongt   ltpropertygt ltconfigurationgt codepre  pstrongmapredsite.xmlstrongp  precodeltconfigurationgt   ltpropertygt     ltnamegtmapreduce.framework.nameltnamegt     ltvaluegtyarnltvaluegt     ltdescriptiongtThe runtime framework for executing MapReduce jobs.

Negative 345 pI have an abstract class defining a pure virtual method in cp  precodeclass Base  Base Base  virtual bool Test  0  codepre  pI have subclassed this with a number of other classes which provide an implementation for Test, which Ill refer to as A, B, C, etc. I now want to create an array of any of these types using this base classp  precodeint mainint argc, char argv[]      int size  0     Base bases  new Base[10]      bases[size]  new A     bases[size]  new B      for int i  0 i lt size i              Base base  bases[i]         basegtTest       codepre  pExcuse any errors I might have made, Im writing this on the fly to provide a simple example.p  pThe problem is I cant instantiate the array as it would require creating an instance of the Base class which it cant do as its abstract. However, without doing this, it hasnt allocated the memory needed to assign to the indices of the array, and thus provides a segmentation fault when trying to access that memory. I am under the impression that its not good practice to mix new and delete with malloc and free.p  pIt may be that I have confused the way this should be used and I should be attempting to use templates or some other mechanism to do this, but hopefully Ive provided enough information to illustrate what Im attempting to do.p  pSo what is the best way of doing this and how would I get around this problem of allocating memory to an abstract classp  pThanks, Danp
Negative 345 pI will implement a virtual machine in x86 and I wonder what kind of design would yield best results. What should I concentrate on to squish out the juice I will to implement the whole virtual machine in x86 assembly.p  pI havent much instructions and I can choose their form. The instructions project directly into smalltalks syntax in blocks. I give out the instruction design I were thinking ofp  precode ...        return null      return nothing object     address to object ... selector ...  message pass in this case arity1 selector selector var  ...  set var  get codepre  pThe sort of VM I were thinking aboutp  precodemov eax, [esi] add esi, 2 mov ecx, eax and eax, 0xff and ecx, 0xff00  256 shr ecx, 5           8 jmp [ecx4  operations] align 8     operations dd retnull dd ret  so on...     retnull           jumps here at retnul  ... retnull action     ret  ... ret action etc. codepre  pDont start asking why I need yet another virtual machine implementation. Interpretive routines arent stock stuff you just pick up whenever you need them. Most virtual machines you are proposing elsewhere are weighted towards portability with the cost of performance. My goal is not the portability, my goal is the performance.p  pThe reason this interpreter is needed at all is because smalltalk blocks doesnt end up gotten interpreted the same wayp  precodeA  B subclass [     def ax [ xx]     clmet b [...]     def c [...]     def d [...] ]  [ 2 lt x ] whileTrue [...]  i isNeat ifTrue [...] ifFalse [...]  List fromBlock [     carrots     apples     oranges toUpper ] codepre  pI need the real benefit coming from the interpretive routines, that is the choice of context where to read the program in. Of course, good compiler should just most of the time compile the obvious cases like ifTrueifFalse or whileTrue, or the list example. The need for interpreter doesnt just disappear because you always may hit a case where you cant be sure the block gets the treatment you expect.p

Negative 345 pIm trying to build an InfoPath addin to allow template editors as opposed to end users to preview the form with sample data populated.p  pFirst, a little background on our environment.  We have a custom process that connects to MOSS, downloads the appropriate datasource assemblies for a given form, and invokes them to load data from the database into the form such as recipient address information in a letter template.  This process is launched when the form is downloaded and passed parameters via the URL for the data retrieval.  I am able to approximate this behavior by passing parameters to a locally saved form template via the command line.p  pArmed with that knowledge, I set out to build an InfoPath addin that would do the followingp  ol liDisplay a custom toolbar button in Design mode that the template editor can click to populate the form with sample data requires parameters to be passed.li liWhen the button is clicked, save a copy of the active template to a temp folder and use the Shell command to pass parameters to the form.  The copy of the form would then be launched in a separate InfoPath window.li ol  pI referred to various online tutorials and Apress Pro InfoPath 2007 for guidance along the way, and like previous posts on here, discovered the information available to be very limited.  Im part way there, but ran into a few issuesp  ol liI was able to get the custom toolbar button to show up, but only in Preview mode.  I need the button to show up in Design mode.li liThe Application.ActiveWindow.XDocument.SaveAs method appears to save only the form, not the entire template. Perhaps this is because I am in Preview mode rather than Design mode  Maybe addressing the first issue will resolve this as well.li liIn an effort to avoid the two issues above, I looked into how I might call the FormEventsLoading handler in my form template solution.  This would allow me to pass it the test parameters without having to resort to saving a copy and launching it via the command line.  I could not figure out how to do this.li ol  pAny ideas or suggestions  Thanks in advance for your helpp

Negative 345 pI am designing a game server with scripting capabilities. The general design goes like thisp  precodeClient connects to Server, Server initializes Client, Server sends Client to EventManager separate thread, uses libevent, EventManager receives receive Event from Client socket, Client manages what it received via callbacks. codepre  pNow the last part is whats the most tricky for me now.p  pCurrently my design allows me for a class which inherits codeClientcode to create callbacks to specific received events. These callbacks are managed in a list and the received buffer goes through a parsing process each time something is received. If the buffer is valid, the callback is called where it is act upon what is in the buffer. One thing to note is that the callbacks can go down to the scripting engine, at which point nothing is sure what can happen.p  pEach time a callback finishes, the current receive buffer has to be reset etc. Callbacks currently have no capability of returning a value, because as stated before, anything can happen.p  pWhat happens is that when somewhere in the callback something says thisdisconnect, I want to immediately disconnect the codeClientcode, remove it from the codeEventManagercode, and lastly remove it from the codeServercode, where it also should get finally destructed and free memory. However, I still have some Code running after the callback finishes in the Client, thus I cant free memory.p  pWhat should I change in the design Should I have some timed event in the codeServercode which checks which codeClientcodes are free to destroy Would that create additional overhead I dont need Would it still be okay after the callback finishes to run minimal code on the stack codereturn 1code or notp  pI have no idea what to do, but I am open for complete design revamps.p  pThanks in advance.p

Negative 345 pIm trying to use codeNSAssertcode throughout my iPhone app so that if an unexpected condition occurs, the application failsfast and crashes with a meaningful message in the crash log.p  pThis works fine if the failing codeNSAssertcode is on the main thread, as it raises codeNSInternalInconsistencyExceptioncode by default which is uncaught and stops execution. But Im also doing processing in background threads, in which case the codeNSAssertcode just aborts the thread, but the programming keeps running.p  pMy current solution is to catch and rethrow the exception in the main thread in this case, codeNSOperationcodes codemaincode methodp  precode voidmain      try          int x  14         ...

Negative 345 pI have a lot of images taken from a 360 camera which I would like to be able to display in Silverlight 3. They are NOT regular panorama images. The camera which took the image actually creates a distorted jpeg that becomes undistorted once wrapped around a sphere as a texture. I have desktop software that will allow viewing of the image not just sidetoside, but straight up, down, etc. and I need to try to get the same functionality in Silverlight. It is very similar to Google StreetView.p  pWhat I think I need is to create a sphere, wrap the jpeg on the sphere as a texture, then put the camera inside the sphere. I doubt this is possible in Silverlight, but perhaps there is a way to simulate thisp  pSo far, Google searches arent bringing anything up. Can anyone point me in the right direction to figure out how to do this Are there any existing projects that do thisp  pAn example of a typical image is a hrefhttpimg211.imageshack.usimg2115640113014255138.jpg relnofollowhere.ap
Negative 345 pMy scenario is that I have a .net application lets say a Console App that creates AppDomains.  It then needs to create instances and call methods on Types that are in that AppDomain.

Negative 345 pWe have an asp.net application that uses the Oracle client.  In the connection string, we specify the 3 basic attributes data source, User Id, and Password.  We are using connection pooling.  Our data resides in 2 different Oracle schemas.  Most of the requests are for data from Schema1.  The timeouts are coming from calls for data from schema2p  pIs it possible that the connections are implicitly tied to a schemap  pThat would explain a lot.  Since most of the calls are for data from schema1, the pool gets filled with connections that are only good for schema1.  Then a call comes for data from schema2 and none of the connections in the pool can satisfy the request and we get the timeout.p  pThanks for any help,  Greg p

Negative 345 pIm trying to get the absolute screen pixel coordinates of the top left corner of a view. However, all methods I can find such as codegetLeftcode and codegetRightcode dont work as they all seem to be relative to the parent of the view, thus giving me code0code. What is the proper way to do thisp  pIf it helps, this is for a put the picture back in order game. I want the user to be able to draw a box to select multiple pieces. My assumption is that the easiest way to do that is to codegetRawXcode and codegetRawYcode from the codeMotionEventcode and then compare those values against the top left corner of the layout holding the pieces. Knowing the size of the pieces, I can then determine how many pieces have been selected. I realise I can use codegetXcode and codegetYcode on the codeMotionEventcode, but as that returns a relative position that makes determining which pieces were selected more difficult. Not impossible, I know, but it seems unnecessarily complicated.p  pThanksp  pEdit This is the code I used to try to get the size of the holding container, as per one of the questions. codeTableLayoutcode is the table which holds all the puzzle pieces.p  precodeTableLayout tableLayout  TableLayout findViewByIdR.id.tableLayout Log.dLOGTAG, Values   tableLayout.getTop  tableLayout.getLeft codepre  pEdit 2 Here is the code Ive tried, following more of the suggested answers.p  precodepublic int[] tableLayoutCorners  new int[2] ...  TableLayout tableLayout  TableLayout findViewByIdR.id.tableLayout tableLayout.requestLayout Rect corners  new Rect tableLayout.getLocalVisibleRectcorners Log.dLOGTAG, Top left   corners.top  ,   corners.left  ,   corners.right              ,   corners.bottom  cells[4].getLocationOnScreentableLayoutCorners Log.dLOGTAG, Values   tableLayoutCorners[0]  ,   tableLayoutCorners[1] codepre  pThis code was added after all the initialisation is done. The image has been divided up into a array of ImageViews the cells[] array contained within a codeTableLayoutcode. Cells[0] is the top left codeImageViewcode, and I picked cells[4] as its somewhere in the middle and most definitely should not have coordinates of 0,0.p  pThe code shown above still gives me all 0s in the logs, which I really dont understand because the various puzzle pieces are correctly displayed. I tried public int for tableLayoutCorners and default visibility, both giving the same result.p  pI dont know if this is significant, but the codeImageViewcodes are originally not given a size. The size of the codeImageViewcodes is determined during the initialisation automatically by the View when I give it an image to display. Could this contribute to their values being 0, even though that logging code is after they have been given an image and have automatically resized themselves To potentially counter that, I added the code codetableLayout.requestLayoutcode as shown above, but that didnt help.p  pIm stumped... Thanks again to anyone who can help.p
Negative 345 pDoes anyone came across a problem when you have a Class that inherits from Forms and then have all the forms inherit from Class, and then tried to load the form in design mode in visual studio Does it loads correctly, because on mine it shows Illegal characters in path.. I ran the visual studio in debug mode and found that it is try to check a path for the file I suppose and gets the  of the generic definition. So is it possible to implement generics over windows forms or do I have to get a workaround for this, I have searched the internet for some examples or clues where to follow but could find any important one.

Negative 345 pIm trying to find all instances of an advert on a website. The advert is in an iframe which is loaded by javascript it doesnt appear at all if javascript is turned off. Detecting the advert itself is extremely simple, both the name of the flash file and the target of the href always contain a certain string.p  pWhat would be the best starting point for achieving this At the moment Im considering an Adobe AIR app, which could crawl the site and examine the DOM to find the ad, and would run javascript and load the content of the iframe. The other option I can think of is using Firefox as the platform using maybe GreaseMonkey or Selenium I dont really know how to leverage Firefox like this.p  pDoes anyone know of anything suitable to build this, or have any suggestions on using Firefox to do itp  hr  pExtra detailsp  pBeing CPU intensive isnt really an issue, nor is anything depending on a browser being open. This doesnt need to run on a headless server, it will be running on a powerful desktop box. OS is also not an issue. It would be advantageous if the crawler loaded each page multiple times, as the advert is in rotation. While the crawler does need to execute the javascript and load the content of the iframe, it does not need to be able to display flash files.p

Negative 345 pI know that merging noncontiguous changesets at once may not be a good idea. However there is at least one situation in which merging noncontiguous changesets is probably not going to break anything when there are no intervening changes on the affected individual files. At least, it wouldnt break any worse than would a series of cherrypicked merges, checked in each time and at least this way you would discover breakage before checking in. p  pFor instance, lets say you have a Main and a Development branch. They start out identical e.g. after a release. They have two files, foo.cs and bar.cs.p  pAlice makes a change in Developmentfoo.cs and checks it in as changeset 1001. Bob makes a change in Developmentbar.cs and checks it in as 1002. Alice makes another change to Developmentfoo.cs and checks it in as 1003.p  pNow we could in theory merge both changes 1001 and 1003 from devto main in a single operation. If we try to merge at the branch level, devtomain, we will have to do it as two operations. In this simple, contrived example its simple enough to merge the one file  but in the real world where there would be many files involved, its not so simple.p  pNoncontiguous merging is one of the reasons given for why merge by workitem is not implemented in TFS.p

Negative 345 pWe have several fairly large JavaScript files embedded into a single script resources DLL. This is then consumed by multiple projects by way of a reference and page includes via the ASP.NET script manager. This keeps things nice and neat within our ASP.NET pages and requires very little work to integrate into new projects.p  pThe problem is that some of these script files are quite larger approx 100KB and take time to download. By running minify on them before embedding this is reduced down a lot around 70KB but not enough. What we would like to do is GZIP the files before they are embedded. However, just gzipping the files causes syntax errors as the content is not unzipped. There is a content type textjavascript applied in AssemblyInfo when the resource is embedded but we cant find a way to specify contentencoding.p  pIs there any way to make this work without having to write a httpmodulehandler which would mean changing the config for all consuming projects p

Since I dont know SpringHibernate I was concerned if its a bad plan to start learning them while creating a new project, especially since it will slow down the early development.p  pOne idea I had was to write a prototype using tech I emdoem know, namely JSPServletsJDBC, since I can get this running much quicker with my current knowledge. I emcouldem then throw the whole thing away and start over with Spring, etc, but Id like to consider how easy it would be to refactor a smallish project from JSPServletsJDB to SpringMVCHibernate My DB could of course be reused but what about other code... would I expect to save most of it plugged into an MVC framework, or is the paradigm shift big enough this would cause more trouble than it avoidsp  hr  pemPlease use the a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions2903185choosebetterormorefamiliartechnologiesforanewprojectothera question for more general advice on choosing technologiesemp

And in fact, strongthis works perfectly right nowstrong.p  pUnfortunately, having that weird codeindex.phpcode in the URI is unwieldy and unnecessary, so CI suggests using .htaccess to allow the URI to omit that section of the URI and silently reenter it in the background, using modrewrite.p  pWhen I add the RewriteRule above, however, it doesnt work. Sop  pcodecontrollerqwelcomecode returns a 404 error when it should return exactly the same thing as codecontrollerqindex.phpwelcomecode. Thats the problem.

Negative 345 pI have created a Custom ThreadPool which Accepts Jobs from Client, Processes it and Returns the Results. Currently this is running in MVC Application. Where User Uploads the Job to be done using a form, Server will process it and return the Report. The Processing involves Sending SOAP Requests to Multiple External Services and Accumulating the Response. p  pRecently I created a Windows Based application which can automate the Uploading Tasks and also will handle Callbacks for Current Status of the Job. Thus I implemented a WCF Service with netTCPBinding amp Callback Contract amp Hosted it in a Console Application. Everything is working well, Windows Application is receiving callbacks etc. But major problem is performance. It is taking 4 times more to process same Job via WCF Request than Manual Upload via MVC Application.p  pInitially I doubted it is lag in Communication thus I implemented a Stopwatch to find the duration of each step. Surprisingly the Delay is not due to communication lag, it is occurring is the last routine which makes SOAP Requests to External Services. In my opinion this is independent of Mode of Transport of Job from the Client to Server and this also runs in Separate Threads in Custom ThreadPool.p  pI am using Same API in MVC Application and WCF Service. Logic, Routine everything is same. My Second doubt was whether WCF HaltsSuspends the running threads to process new requests p  pCan anybody have insight on what could be the reason I can provide some more information based on what is required. p  pThanks in advance for the Helpp

Negative 345 pGreetings all,p  pIm working on a WiX installation script for my program.  I need to install a C dll to the GAC and then register it.  So, I mark the file with codeAssembly.netcode so that WiX GACs it for me, and then I have a deferred custom action, set to run before codeInstallFinalizecode, which calls codeAssembly.Loadcode to load the assembly from the GAC and then codeRegistrationServices.RegisterAssemblycode to register it.p  pShould be perfect, except for one problem Apparently the dll isnt actually written to the GAC until the commit phase, so when my custom action runs, codeAssembly.Loadcode throws because it cant find the file.  Where is it  Is it at all accessible before the commit phase  Or is there a better way to do this entirely  Seems like such a trivial thing...p  pPlease do not suggest using codeheat.execode Id really like to avoid it.  My program has a codeComRegisterFunctioncode that would like to execute on the users computer if at all possible.p
Negative 345 pFrom what I know, a blocking receive on a TCP socket does not always detect a connection error due either to a network failure or to a remoteendpoint failure by returning a code1code value or raising an IO exception sometimes it could just hang indefinitely.p  pOne way to manage this problem is to set a timeout for the blocking receive. In case an upper bound for the reception time is known, this bound could be set as timeout and the connection could be considered lost simply when the timeout expires when such an upper bound is not known a priori, for example in a pubsub system where a connection stays open to receive publications, the timeout to be set would be somewhat arbitrary but its expiration could trigger a pingpong request to verify that the connection and the endpoint too is still up.p  pI wonder whether the use of asynchronous receive also manages the problem of detecting a connection failure. In boostasio I would call codesocketasynchreadsomecode registering an handler to be asynchronously called, while in java.nio I would configure the channel as nonblocking and register it to a selector with an codeOPREADcode interest flag. I imagine that a correct connectionfailure detection would mean that, in the first case the handler would be called with a non0 errorcode, while in the second case the selector would select the faulty channel but a subsequent codereadcode on the channel would either return code1code or throw an codeIOExceptioncode.p  pIs this behaviour guaranteed with asynchronous receive, or could there be scenarios where after a connection failure, for example, in boostasio the handler will never be called or in java.nio the selector will never select the channelp  pThank you very much.p

This user would be able to create new users for that company, and since she would have total permissions, he would be able to do everything that the other users can do.li liCompany User Depending on the privileges assigned by its super user, this user would be able to do and see different data for example, a simple user would just be able to see information from one of the many company buildings.li ul  pSo, even though Ive seen many authentication libraries out there for CodeIgniter, it would be nice to hear any recommendations about how I could design this authentication role based system, and if you particularly recommend a library that could help to accomplish this.p  pAppreciatep

I just expect the world to be quite large. The usual approach of map[x][y] multidimensional array started out as a basic idea, but since Java does not provide a way for noninteger i.e. negative array key shenanigans like PHP does, I cannot properly have a x,x,y,y coordinate system with array keys.p  pI need to be able to find the objects on a tile at a specific x,y coordinate as well as finding adjacent tiles of a certain tile. Trivial if I can getObjectAtx,y, I can getx1,y and so onp  pI have read about quad trees and Rtrees and the like. The concept is exciting, however I havent seen any good, simple example implementation in Java. And besides I am not really sure if that is what I need exactly.p  pAny advice is welcomep  pThank youp

The more pixels are at a certain depth the brighter the texture is at that point with black being no pixels are at that depth and white being all pixels are at that depth.p  pNow I have a solution that does glReadPixels on the depthbuffer, analyzes it on the CPU and then writes it back to the texture. Naturally this is a real bottleneck in the application.p  pIm looking for an all GPU solution where the depth buffer is analyzed in a shader or somesuch and update the texture that way. I thought about creating a fragment shader that reads the depth value and increases to the corresponding pixel in the texture, but that would require that fragment shaders can write to other textures. Something Ive learned to be a nono, especially if they have to write to the same pixel.p  pIs there a trick or technique that I am missing or am I forced to involve the CPU in thisp

Negative 345 pI am in the early stages of learning the NetBeans platform. I note that NetBeans 7.0 makes extensive use of annotations to register classes, specify window modes etc. This is a nice feature, but the learning materials that Ive found so far a hrefhttprads.stackoverflow.comamznclick0132354802Rich Client Programminga, a hrefhttpwww.apress.com9781430224174The Definitive Guidea, the tutorials at netbeans.org, and the latest a hrefhttprefcardz.dzone.comrefcardznetbeansplatform70refcarda all make extensive reference to inspecting and editing the layer.xml file. Since Im still in the lower foothills of the learning curve Im finding it hard to juggle annotated code with layer file examples.p  pIm considering dropping back to a 6.x version of NetBeans while learning, to be in sync with the books and tutorials, at least until I get the core API and basic practices under my belt. Id appreciate hearing from experienced NetBeans platform users and developers on whether thats sensible, or if it might be better, in the long term, to stick with NetBeans 7 from the beginning.p

Negative 345 pI have troubles understanding what to specifically add to the classpath, or what this error means.p  pMy setup is this in Netbeansp  precodePackage   gt src         gt FooMainApplet.java         gt FooMainAppletMyJcomponent.java codepre  pThe Jcomponent class simply extends jComponent in which I believe is valid, and has a few helper methods i.e. getPreferredSize  and alikep  pI can add this new component manually, with the getContainer.add method however it is not visualized on the designer, even if I use the second .add parameter and define the layout styles as the designer would normally.p  pWhen I try to add it as a component i.e. dragging the .java file on the the form, or manually adding it as a .jar file in the pallette manager, or even placing it in what I assume are class path jars it comes up with the following errorp  precodeCannot load component class ltprojectnamegt.ltcustomcomponentsnamegt from JAR file ltsome path to distgtltmainprojectjargt.jar.

Negative 345 pOriginal Is there a way to kill a child activity of a TabActivity. I have a very simple tab setup. There are two tabs. One of the tabs contains a MapActivity. When I switch to the MapActivity the GPS turns on. When I press back, the TabActivity exits, but the GPS is still on. The gps doesnt turn off until I explicitly kill the app. Is there a way to kill the MapActivity from the TabActivity I would like to kill it when TabActivity exitsonBackPressed.p  pEditbr I do attempt to stop location requests in onDestroy and onPause in my MapActivity. I am using the MyLocationOverlay class an calling disableCompass and disableMyLocation in the onDestroy method. These methods are called, but the GPS remains on. If I call enableMyLocation and immediately call disableMyLocation during onCreate, the gps will turn off. hr Edited title to reflect the answerbr Turns out the problem is unexpected behavior with MyLocationOverlays enabledisable. These functions do not appear to be idempotent. Multiple calls to enable and disable do not turn it on once or off once as one might expect. Ensuring one call to enable in onResume and one call to disable in onPause will disable location requests when exiting an activity.p

I will get errors if I try to reference the DOM elements from another part of this program, probably because it is only     in this function that I actually create the DOM object. Once this function finishes, then the temp object reference is passed      back into my initialization loop, where at that point I cannot add any more DOM elements.       .animate  Raphaels animation function. Note that the properties that are animated are defined in the first argument,     between a set of . The second argument is the time in milliseconds that the animation will take.      .toFront amp .toBack  These functions move the object to the top or bottom of the drawing stack. In other words, if I use      toFront on an object, it should be drawn on top of everything else, and viceversa. This eliminates a graphical issue where the      tiles overrlap while expanded.      .node.setAttribute  .getAttributekey, value  These are the DOM functions to set and get attributes of specific DOM elements.     I am using these instead of .attrattr, value because I cant perform jQuery operations on the DOM elements at this point in the script.          end drawRect   Initialize the grid of rectangles for var i  0 i lt grid.length i       for var j  0 j lt grid[i].length j           cellName  cell   i    j           drawRectcolor, x, y, width, height, corner radius         grid[i][j]  drawRectcolors[Math.floorMath.random  colors.length], startx  width  j, starty  height  i, width, height, cornerRadius           used for debugging         debugString  ltbrgtgrid[  i  ][  j  ] x   startx  width  j   y   starty  height  i        end inner for loop     end outer for loop codepre  pIm not a Javascript expert so any help would be appreciated.

Negative 345 pIm building UI for rich web application which should work equally well on desktops and smartphones. Interface contains some nonrectangular elements and curved lines so it couldnt be made with common html. Also there are icons originally presented as SVG and some complex effects shadows, blurring etc..p  pSVG is best choice but as far as I know Andnroid builtin browser did not support it. On the other hand canvas could be faster but here comes problems with effects implementation, events generating and inability to selectcopy text.p  pIts possible to make independent implementation for both cases and select best one at runtime, but support and further development of such a system could become a real headache. Im thinking of intermediate abstract layer which could connect to SVG or Canvas renderer.

Negative 345 pI am trying to learn, how to implement delegation pattern in objective C. But the discussion almost exclusively concentrates on the strongadoptionstrong of protocols and then strongimplementing the delegate methodsstrong that come with particular protocol  or  the delegation principle alone  or protocols alone.   p  pWhat I am unable to find, is a easy to understand material about how to write a class that will serve as a delegator. By that I mean the class, which the message of some event will come from and which will provide the protocol for receiving that message  kind of 2in1 description. protocols and delegation. p  pFor the purpose of my learning, Id like to go along the following trivial example, using an iPhone, a Cocoa touch application and Xcode4.2, using ARC, no Storyboard or NIBs.p  pLets have a class with name Delegator, which is a subclass of NSObject. The Delegator class has NSString instance variable named report and adopts the UIAccelerometerDelegate protocol.In the Delegator implementation, I will implement the the delegate method p  precodevoidaccelerometerUIAccelerometer accelerometer didAccelerateUIAcceleration acceleration  codepre  pThis delegate method will create a NSString  myReport and store it in the report variable anytime there is an accelerometer event. Further, I want to have a second class named ReportsStorage a subclass of NSobject, which can store some Nsstring report in its instance variable called latestReport. So far so good.  Now lets get back to theDelegator Class. Id like to implement a protocol in Delegator named ReportsDelegate which will notify the class that adopts it the ReportsStorage class, that a report was generated and will pass this report through the delegate method, which should be I believe something like thisp  precodevoiddelegatorDelegator delegator didCreateNewReportNSString report codepre  pCan you please provide the code for Delegator Class incl. the delegate property, that will achieve this, with a description what each line of code means   p  pThanks in advance, EarlGrey p

After this, I need to reset this background position to 0px 0px directly with the jQuery .css function, and then animate it again likep  precodecontent.moveBackgroundY300, 2100, easeInOutCubic codepre  pIn this case, as I reseted my background position to 0px 0px, the parameter strongnowstrong should go from 0 to 300, but it goes from 900 to 300, where 900 was the value I set first calling my function.p  pAnyone knows what is wrong, or how could I reset this parameter so as It takes the correct values each timep  pI have another function like it that rotates the element changing the CSS3 property transform  rotate, and I have the same problem.p  pThanks for your helpp

Negative 345 pIm trying to enable multisampling in an OpenGL program Im writing.  The application will require a substantial amount of GUI, so I am using wxPython with which I am less familiar instead of PyGame SDL.p  pI really need hardware multisampling for the main GLCanvas.  I am aware that this is borderline possible in the C version of wx, e.g., a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions21560howtoenablemultisamplingforawxwidgetsopenglprogramHow to enable multisampling for a wxWidgets OpenGL programa.  However, I attempted something similar, but it didnt work for wxbPythonb.p  pSo, what I want to know is, is multisampling even possible with wxPythonp  pIdeas Ive already thought ofp  ul liUse a PyGame context inside a wx.Frame instead.  Use SDLs hardware multisampling.  No idea if this would actually work.  IIRC, resizing SDL OpenGL contexts destroys their contents, which would be somewhat of a problem with this application.  Although . . . I guess it might be workable.li liUse a FBO with a higher resolution to render, and then downsample with multisampling.  This . . . works, sorta.  But supersampling is much slower than multisampling, and the technique doesnt work very well for things like GLLINE.  I have already tried this solution.li liUse a FBO with a multisampling render target.  This would involve a lot of changes, and would limit crosssystem portability.li liIdeally use wxPythons builtin support, if it exists.li ul  pThanks,br Ianp

Negative 345 pIm researching ways to communicate with a USB device in Linux and would prefer to not write a Linux Kernel driver. I understand that libusb exists and is a userland library that would work, but our embedded device doesnt support usbfs  and would be really a pain to change kernels to add the support .p  pSo my question is basically this Is it possible  advisable to communicate with a USB device by directly reading and writing to the devUSB or the udev file corresponding to the USB device thus bypassing the need for a custom Linux Driver and usbfsp  pIm hoping its possible to communicate using the USB devices protocol just by reading  writing protocol packets directly through filetype readwrite commands once the devUSB or udev device file is open.p  pThoughts and suggestions please.p  pFOLLOW UPp  pSince the USB device I needed to talk to is a USB HID class device, I was able to use libudev and the standard Linux USB HID RAW driver by reading  writing directly to devhidraw0   or the appropriate devhidraw device .

Negative 345 pWeve deployed our EAR application in WAS7. This EAR application uses asynchbeans, Work Manager. Purpose of this application is to have the work manager spawn some works, at the start of a servlet. These works are intended to run constantly, doing a polling and processing functionthis app was originally standalone, the WAS enabling is done at our customers insisting. The processing is happening satisfactorily, but, through WAS console, when we stop our app, it is taking the WAS also down with it. When we debug the servlet destroy of our appwhere it is attempted to WorkManager.joinall workitems, we see that our app has not managed to free all work manager resources used. Could it be because of this that, WAS is also shutting down when the app is stoppedWe tried this app in WAS6.1, where too the the behavior is same Please help..p

Negative 345 pSo Ive been running into this for a while and Ive seen other questions  answers pertaining close to the subject but I dont feel I understand whats going on yet.p  pIm using Spring Roo 1.1.15, Eclipse 3.6.0 amp Maven 2.2.1.p  pI have found that if I have had a successful run of tests running from within Eclipse and then make any modification to a RooEntity class object that anyall Roocentric tests will fail on the next run with the followingp  precodeEntity manager has not been injected is the Spring Aspects JAR configured as an AJCAJDT aspects library codepre  pThis will continue until I do the followingp  ol liEnable Build Automatically in Eclipses Project menuli lipFlip over to a terminal window and at the project root issuep  pcodemvn o clean packagecodepli liOnce mvn is finished, then flip back over to Eclipse and refresh the projectli liLet Eclipse refresh and then rebuildli ol  pAt this point I can run the test suite and it will report accurate information.

For example, subtracting 5 from every value in the X coordinate list and 3 from every value in the Y coordinate list. Im then going to take the abs of each value and find the minimum.

Negative 345 pI have an issue with a game Ive been making for Android with Air. The app orients itself correctly staying in landscape up until I lock the phone Im testing with and then unlock it. When the phone unlocks, the app will then be in portrait mode it should always be in landscape.p  pIn the descriptor xml file I have set fullscreen to true, aspect ratio to landscape and auto orient to false but this doesnt seem to affect the app when being locked and unlocked it works perfectly in any other scenario. It will become portrait again and not move back to landscape when unlocked so auto orient being false definitely isnt being meddled with.p  pThis issue only triggers when youre running the game and lock the phone and unlock. If for example you were to press the home button so the app is no longer in focus, then lock and unlock and get back into the paused game it will still be in landscape.p  pEDIT Ive just made an important discovery It seems this is dependant on what kind of lock screen you use on your phone. I use an android 4 galaxy s3. I switched it to not use a lock screen and the app stayed in landscape when I unlocked This is progress. Unfortunately my friend who has a different android 4.0 phone has reported the same issue so its not just my phone.p

Negative 345 pIm a little stuck plotting a 3D array in MATLAB. I have created some histograms that vary as I change a certain threshold. Meaning, for t65, I have one histogram, for t70, another and so on. I would like to make a 3D plot or surface where the third dimension is this threshold t from 0100 intervals of 5 and the other two dimensions are intensity and frequency respectively as for the 2D histogram. How can I do that Ive looked at most of the plotting tools such as surf, isosurface, slices and so on. None of them seem to do the trick. My matrix is 80x100x20 where the 20 dimension is that of the threshold. Any ideas THANKSp

Negative 345 pI am trying to make .txt file look like a .jpg file so it can be sent across wifi using an EyeFi SD card. The card only sends .jpg files for several reasons. One reason is that the transmission path of the picture from an the SD card to the computer looks like p  pCamera writes pictures to EYEFI SD  EYEFI connects to local router  local router uploads to EYEFI servers  EYEFI servers upload to your computer.  p  p[Explanation]p  pThere could be some filter on the server end, so I found some a hrefhttpkin.klever.netiiidescription relnofollow titlesoftwaresoftwarea that allows the user to bypass the eyefi servers so now I know I am only dealing with the SD card. Its also nice to know that no one else is looking at my files. After some experimentation, I figured out that I can put .jpg files on the card and have them transmitted once a picture is taken. I also found how that the pictures must be named in short format a name not longer than 8 charactersexcluding file extensions, this probably has to do with the fact the card is formatted in fat32 the card can be reformatted and still works. I tried uploading a .txt file to the card and gave it a similar format, and renamed it as a .jpg file. It did transfer which indicates to me there is probably something other than a file extension which denotes how the file is formatted. p  p[Questions]p  p1 Is there someway I can spoof .txt files to make them look like .jpg filesp  p2 Is there some kind of program I can use for linux to play around with values on the card so I can figure out what triggers an upload Any ideas one what could trigger the uploadp

Negative 345 pThe standard movie player in Media Foundation doesnt seem to support very fluid scrubbing. Id like to make it so that video being shown refreshes constantly as you slide your finger across the bar, rather than jumping every few seconds as it does by default.

Any ideasp  pEdit Im still experimenting, and it looks like there is a set interval between possible scrub start points. Maybe theres some way to decrease the interval.p

Negative 345 pI am new to programming in general so I decided that I would start by making a simple vector class in C.  However I would like to get in to good habits from the start rather than trying to modify my workflow later on.p  pI currently have only two files codevector3.hppcode and codevector3.cppcode. This project will slowly start to grow making it much more of a general linear algebra library as I become more familiar with everything, so I would like to adopt a standard project layout to make life easier later on.  So after looking around I have found two ways to go about organizing hpp and cpp files, the first beingp  precodeproject  src      vector3.hpp      vector3.cpp codepre  pand the second beingp  precodeproject  inc     project         vector3.hpp  src      vector3.cpp codepre  pWhich would you recommend and whyp  pSecondly I would like to use the Google C Testing Framework for unit testing my code as it seems fairly easy to use. Do you suggest bundling this with my code, for example in a codeincgtestcode or codecontribgtestcode folder If bundled, do you suggest using the codefusegtestfiles.pycode script to reduce the number or files, or leaving it as is  If not bundled how is this dependency handledp  pWhen it comes to writing tests, how are these generally organized  I was thinking to have one cpp file for each class codetestvector3.cppcode for example but all compiled in to one binary so that they can all be run together easilyp  pSince the gtest library is generally build using cmake and make, I was thinking that it would make sense for my project to also be built like this  If I decided to use the following project layoutp  precode CMakeLists.txt  contrib     gtest         gtestall.cc         gtest.h  docs     Doxyfile  inc     project         vector3.cpp  src     vector3.cpp  test      testvector3.cpp codepre  pHow would the codeCMakeLists.txtcode have to look so that it can either build just the library or the library and the tests  Also I have seen quite a few projects that have a codebuildcode and a codebincode directory.  Does the build happen in the build directory and then the binaries moved out in to the bin directory  Would the binaries for the tests and the library live in the same place Or would it make more sense to structure it as followsp  precodetest  bin  build  src      testvector3.cpp codepre  pI would also like to use doxygen to document my code.  Is it possible to get this to automatically run with cmake and makep  pSorry for so many questions, but I have not found a book on C that satisfactorily answers these type of questions.p

Negative 345 pI am using Spring Security 3.0.7 on a project at work. Our application site can be reached via redirection from different sites. We use concurrency filter and a session authentication strategy. p  pSituation 1 If you reach the site from a referer in Firefox, and then you reach our site from a different referer in another browser say Chrome, your session in Firefox is destroyed, and you can work normally in Chrome. p  pSituation 2 The interesting part is this my workstation is Ubuntu and when i try to reach from a referer in a tab, then try to reach from another referer on a different tab, older session is discarded again and I have to login and etc. This behaviour is same like the above paragraph. p  pSituation 3 I try again from my Ubuntu desktop, and reach the application site from same referrer in different tabs. This time my previous session id is overwritten, and the flow got mixed up because of this. p  pSituation 4 On Windows systems by the way, if i access separately from different referrers to the application from different tabs of a same browser, my sessions got mixed up, sessions are just overwritten and the actions done on the application get mixed. Same behaviour as Situation 3. p  pMy intention is to get rid of situation 4, and configure the security system to work as Situation 2. Can I do this with spring securityp

Negative 345 pIm trying to store userinput in an XML document on the clientside javascript, and transmit that to the server for persistence. p  pOne user, for example, pasted in text that included an STX character 0x2.

Or perhaps the .attr call should have escaped the STX character, but in either case, invalid XML was produced.p  pIm finding the output of inbrowser XMLSerializer isnt always wellformed, and doesnt even satisfy the browsers own DOMParserp  pThis example shows that the STX character is not properly encoded by XMLSerializerp  precodegt doc  .parseXMLltxml version1.0 encodingutf8 gtnltelemgtltelemgt     document gt doc.findelem.attrsomeattr, String.fromCharCode0x2     [ ltelem someattrgtltelemgt ] gt serializedDoc  new XMLSerializer.serializeToStringdoc     ltxml version1.0 encodingutf8gtltelem someattrgtltelemgt gt .parseXMLserializedDoc     Error Invalid XML ltxml version1.0 encodingutf8gtltelem someattrgtltelemgt codepre  pHow should I construct an XML document inbrowser with params determined by arbitrary userinput such that it will always be wellformed everything properly escaped I dont need to support IE8 or IE7.p  pAnd yes, I do validate the XML on the server side, but if the browser hands the server a document that is not wellformed, the best the server can do is reject it, which isnt that helpful to the poor userp
Negative 345 pok, so we are supposed to make a program that simply reads proper input for a date in the format of mmddyyyy. All I  have learned so far are ifelse statements, touched on enums a bit, string processing, switch statements, and thats pretty much it. I figured the best way to go about this was to use a delimiter of  to capture each month day and year input separately, but when I run  what you see below, the program literally just stops after you enter, say 5161985......to clarify the program is actually still running, but nothing happens i.e. the expected string process and the output of their values. Once I type in the date, it just does nothing, and I was wondering why Did the delimiter not work Am I thinking of using a delimiter in the wrong way Its driving me crazy lol, any advice would be nicep  pAlso wanted to add that I tried this both with creating strings after the delimiter as you see below and with just trying to capture INT values using nextInt.....still does the same thing and nothing happens after the initial date entry....p  precodeScanner keyboard  new ScannerSystem.in  keyboard.useDelimiter  String month  keyboard.next String day  keyboard.next String year  keyboard.next  int monthi  Integer.parseIntmonth int dayi  Integer.parseIntday int yeari  Integer.parseIntyear  System.out.printlnmonthi System.out.printlndayi System.out.printlnyeari codepre

Heres what I havep  precodefunction window, document, undefined       var myObj  function      not a noop     var ua  function  return navigator.userAgent.toLowerCase      function noop    empty noop function      myObj.prototype           constructor myObj,         renderizr              presto ua.matchoperaprestoi,             trident ua.matchtridenti,  dont parse msie as opera uses this sometimes             webkit ua.matchchromesafariwebkiti,             gecko ua.matchfirefoxgeckoi,  dont parse netscape as a lot of strings use this             val   keep empty for now                     renderizr.val extension      use this so the user can print the value of      the rendering engine instead of using multiple      conditional statements.         ifthis.renderizr.presto  this.renderizr.val  Presto          else ifthis.renderizr.trident  this.renderizr.val  Trident          else ifthis.renderizr.webkit  this.renderizr.val  Webkit          else ifthis.renderizr.gecko  this.renderizr.val  Gecko       window.myObj  new myObj  window, document  codepre  pThis way, you can do codealertmyObj.renderizr.valcode instead of doing monotonous conditional statements. p  pI dont want to do generic browser name detection because youre only supposed to test for the features which you need, not the browser. However, some rendering engines have different habits for rendering web pages, so I do want to include bengine detectionb in my script. However, I dont suggest using this, like I said, I just want to get to know javascript and how it works, and its not working.p  pSo my question is, what am I doing wrong here and how can I fix it Why doesnt the codethiscode keyword workp

However, there were no tickets resolved on the date 542013.  p  pHow can I combine these two queries into one, and get it to return a result set like belowp  precode Date              Created            Resolved                 512013         396                  400 522013         418                  322 532013         288                  280 542013         28                   0  552013         100                  11 codepre  pI think the part that is throwing me off is that there is no resolved date of 542013 in the table.  Any help would be much appreciated.  Thanksp

Negative 345 pIm giving Azure a go with MVC4, and have the simplest data storage requirement I can think of.  Each time my controller is hit, I want to record the datetime and a couple of other details to some location.  There will most likely be only a few thousand hits at most per month.  Then Id like to view a page telling me how many hits rows appended there are.p  pWriting to a text file in the folder with Server.MapPath... gives permission errors and seems not to be possible due to the distributed nature of it.  Getting a whole SQL instance is 10 a month or so.  Using the table or blob storage sounds hopeful, but setting up the service and learning to use those seems nowhere near as simple as just a basic file or DB.p  pAny thoughts would be appreciated.p

Negative 345 pI have a PHP file in which upon clicking the submit button, another PHP script is being executed. Within the second PHP script a shell script is being executed in which an SSH connection is being done to another server.p  pThe issue I have is that the SSH connection to another server can only be done by a particular user. However the PHP script is being executed by wwwdata and for such reason I cannot change user, to the user that needs the ssh connection as it requires a password each time.p  pI also tried to execute the shell script from the first PHP file but still with no success.p  pMy OS is UBUNTU.p  pCan this be done, and if yes, how can this be achieved Thanksp

I set the cookie like sop  precodeHttpCookie responseCookie  HttpContext.Response.Cookies[CartHelper.CART] responseCookie.PackCartCookievm.Cart codepre  pWhere the extension method PackCartCookie set the cookie value like sop  precodecookie.Value  HttpUtility.UrlEncodecookieValue codepre  pThis results is a cookie being stored with the following settingsp  ul liDomain  www.foo.comli liRawSize  230bli liPath  li liExpires  Sessionli liHttpOnly  HttpOnlyli liValue  Encryptedli ul  pWhen a user is interacting with the site it seems that the Cart Cookie is being created but it  is being lost or dropped from time to time. When i look at the Elmah error and review HTTPCOOKIE I can see all the other cookies I have others set in the same way which function fine but i do not see the cart cookie.p  pI have had to change code to be more defensive because of this issue. But as you can imagine the cart cookie is used through out the purchase process and i have had fails when responding to a purchase where i accept payment but the system crashes as the cart is gone and the user is not notified of a successful buy. Luckily i caught this early and refunded users affected.p  pstrongUser Agents where I have seen the issuestrongp  ul liMozilla5.0 X11 Linux i686 AppleWebKit537.36 KHTML, like Gecko Chrome29.0.1547.62 Safari537.36li liMozilla5.0 Windows NT 6.1 WOW64 AppleWebKit537.36 KHTML, like Gecko Chrome29.0.1547.57 Safari537.36li liMozilla5.0 Windows NT 6.0 AppleWebKit537.36 KHTML, like Gecko Chrome29.0.1547.62 Safari537.36li ul

Negative 345 pWhen the listening backlog is full for STREAM unixdomain sockets, codeconnect2code fails on most systems with ECONNREFUSED. It would be preferable for it to return EAGAIN.p  pThe reasoning is that it is highly useful to be able to distinguish between the two cases of dead socket node exists in filesystem, but no process listening anymore and the case of full backlog. I ran into this problem when porting some Linux software which has some code to clean up dead sockets, but its a security vulnerability if the code can be tricked into deleting sockets by spamming them to fill up their backlog.p  pOnly Linux returns EAGAIN AIX, Solaris and Darwin follow BSD behaviour just tested on each.p  pPOSIX doesnt list EAGAIN as a possible return code from connect a hrefhttppubs.opengroup.orgonlinepubs9699919799 relnofollowlinka, so there may be some compliance issue here.p  pWhats the best route to get everyone to change in line with Linux I could go and file a bug report with Oracle, Apple, a FreeBSD PR, and fight it out on the mailing lists of each organisation. Or should I pester someone in a standards body Austin group Is it even advisable to try and get everyone to change here, even though the advantage is clearp

Negative 345 pThe problem is given an array of ints, is it possible to divide the ints into two groups, so that the sum of one group is a multiple of 10, and the sum of the other group is odd. Every int must be in one group or the other. Write a recursive helper method that takes whatever arguments you like, and make the initial call to your recursive helper from splitOdd10. No loops needed.     p  pI have a correct solution below but all my return values are opposite to the correct ones.

Negative 345 pIt is well known that HotSpot analyses runtime usage patterns and performance characteristics and then optimises the JIT process based on that analysis as a Java application is running.

Negative 345 pIm rather unexperienced on the field of microcontrollers, I come from a Java background so the question might seem a bit noob but I didnt find much information on this. p  pSo is it possible to debug an STM32F4 board via bluetooth using eclipse or some othe IDE And if so could you send me some links that might help Were building a robotic car controlled by a discovery board and debugging using an USB cable is not really an option if we dont want to disassemble the whole stuff every time something goes wrong. Hence this would really come in handy. So any help is appreciatedp

Negative 345 pI think I know the answer already is probably No, but Ill ask anyway, as there may be a work around like a lightbox option etcp  pI wrote a banner exchange script, with a difference. When the banner is clicked, a new window opens appears inviting the user to subscribe to a newsletter first, or go straight to sitep  pThis works fine if I use a window.open prompt, as effectively the text for the popup is pulled in from URL of the window ... but I want to use a modal window without the location bar etc. But heres the problem The script runs on siteA, and displays the banners on HTML page of siteB. When you click the banner, it cannot access the javascriptCSS modal window code on the host HTML page. I think even with a light box div, the image or link has to be hard coded into the HTML page first. Can anyone envisage a workaroundp  pHere is what Ive tried thus far in simplified formp  precodeltscriptgt hide id 0 ltscriptgt  ltdivgt ltobject datapopup text pulled from Site A visibilityhidden id0 width720 height600gt ltdivgt ltobject databanner code pulled from SiteA width490 height90gt codepre  pI tried running the javascript from site A, and calling the hide routine via parent.document... to get to the javascript hide routine within the HTML page. Adding an alert to this calling javascript, I get SiteA says hallo when I click the bannerp  pI also tried jumping the banner to a script that would redraw the code to top of the browser, and display the popup code in a div on this new page. I tried window.history.back to get the HTML from the page weve just left ... but all that does is reload the same page and discard the new  codep  pI made the second object code above almost same size as banner so text above and below if on HTML page flows properly.p  ul liOn a slight tangent, it there a way to print a block of code in Javasript. In PERL, you can use print ltltEOF, but at present, if I want to print a large amount of text via javascript, Im using xxxx xxx xxx xx xxx xxx xxx and escaping each and every single quote and newline. Is there a better way to print a line of code that contains numerous newline feedsli ul
Negative 345 pFor a website, I need to route users to their own page. I have a login form, which sends data to a PHP file to check if the users information is correct, and if so, forwarding the user to their page. The only problem is that I need to validate the user on arrival, to check if they logged in or just typed out the URL. I plan to use this with a POST, but how can I autosend the constant i.e. loggedin Is there a way to do that through an HTML form outputted from an echo and sending it when the page loads Thanks in advancep  pEDIT 1 I understand that I must use Sessions, but whenever the page redirects it clears the session. The whole reason I was asking this was because I needed a way to keep the session active. How do I redirect in a way that doesnt clear the sessionp

Negative 345 pThere are 6 iframes in page A. When every iframe is loaded, it needs to send an ajax request to page B and rewrite the data in the database at first and then the src of this iframe direct to another page C in page C, there are some calculation based on the rewritten database. After all this have been done, the next iframe will be loaded. This is a for loop used language php. But now there is a problem, because in page C there are a lot of calculations,  it needs a little long time to calculate. When this iframe is calculating, next iframe has sent his ajax request to page B and the database has been changed.

Negative 345 pIve got a system that deals with a fairly sizeable amount of logs as raw data, processing it down to the usable bits, which it loads into a database.  By sizeable, I mean up to about a gig an hour worth of raw logfiles.p  pThe program gets run from a postrotate clause in logrotate, which rotates the file every 2 hours.  The processing can take a significant amount of time, to the point where, during peak hours, it can take longer than 2 hours to process 2 hours worth of data.  With this in mind, the program is reentrant, and multiple copies of it can run simultaneously.  That part works fine, but heres my problemp  pWhen the first copy of logrotate runs, it moves thing.log.n.gz to thing.log.n1.gz, copies thing.log to thing.log.1, truncates thing.log because I use copytruncate, for reasons I wont go into unless someone thinks its relevant, and starts the processing.  Two hours later, it runs again.  If the first job hasnt finished yet, logrotate hasnt zipped thing.log.1 yet, so it doesnt get moved to thing.log.2, and gets overwritten by the new thing.log.1.  I lose two hours worth of the raw data.

Negative 345 pIm using django and sqlite3 for my website and my client wants me to be able to push to him changes in my room availability for the local small accommodation service I provide. I found that I can do this with pusher but thats as far as Ive managed to get with answers for getting this done. p  pI know with asp.net I can set change tracking on my availability table and create a windows service to run every 18 minutes to poll my database for changes and then send those changes to my client. Is something like this possible with pusher or django itself. Is it possible to do this on change event of value of number of rooms available in  my availability table.  Any advice or direction would be greatly appreciated. p

However, for some reason, an empty line is always outputted before my own output. Ive tried replacing all newlines in the string I was returning with no success. The output is an XML file, and my bank does not accept the file as valid XML because of this empty line. p  pIve already found posts saying this is likely because of PHP closing tags in files before the current file. This might be the cause, but Several third party libraries are loaded, and manually removing all closing PHP tags in each file is undoable if you still want to keep the option to update your libraries. It seems that especially Smarty is fond of these closing tags. p  pDirectly accessing the file itself is also not really an option, because CodeIgniter does not allow this by default, and because this method imposes quite a security problem publically accessible files with bank account details in them are a big nono. p  pTherefore, I come to you do you know another possible solution to this problemp  pEdit This is the code used for the download.p  precodefunction incassoarchivecreditor, date, time, extension      date  strreplace, , date      fn  thisgtincassogtincassofilecreditor, date, time, extension      contents  filegetcontentsfn     name  Incasso date.extension      headerContentType applicationoctetstream     headerContentTransferEncoding Binary     headerContentdisposition attachment filename.name.     echo contents  codepre

Negative 345 pIm having a bit of trouble with my code here. Im trying to make a linked list of Patient objects, each Patient has their various data members, that include name, id, height, etc..All the patients data is in my text file. I have my Linked List class that I have put together. The issue i am having here is that when i add each Patient to my Linked listLLPatient and i go to display the list.

And before some adjustments that i made, i was getting the last patients name that was added printed out. i cant figure out whats wrong for the life of me. I have searched and searched and cant seem to get an answer.p  pUltimately what i need to do for my project would be then to take the patients and display addget birthdayscompare.

The bug is The black background is not showing AFTER it fade out. Try click the menu button once, then close the menu click the background. and open the menu again click the menu. In Android Chrome, the background stay hidden, but it is there since its still clickable.p  pChrome in iOS doesnt have this error. And Ive tried Firefox for Android as well and its working.p  pIs there any error in the code Please help me.p  pThanks in advancep  pEDIT oh and when I change the fadeInOut to simply hide and show, its working. So the problem must be about this fading function.p  pEDIT2 I can change fadeIn to show but keep the fadeOut function and its working So the main culprit is in fadeIn function I guess.p

The intended use for this is to allow Makefiles that use common.mk to compile  files to different Compute Capability targets aka SM arch version.

Negative 345 pI know that if I rotate an object, which extends codejavafx.scene.shape.Shapecode, I can transform it into 3D space, even though it was primarily designed to be in 2D at least as far as I know.p  pLets say I have a 3D scene perspective camera and depth buffer are used, where various codeMeshViewcodes occur. Some are used for areas, others for lines. In both cases those shapes must be triangulated in order to draw them with a codeTriangleMeshcode, which is often nontrivial.p  pNow when I change the drawing of these lines to use the codePolylinecode class, the performance collapse is horrible and there a strange artefacts. I thought I could benefit from the fact, that a polyline has less vertices and the developer doesnt have to triangulate programmatically.p  pIs it discouraged to use shapes extending codejavafx.scene.shape.Shapecode within 3D space Howre they drawn internallyp

Negative 345 pLets say I have an Ingredient entity, and a Recipe entity.  Lots of recipes might refer to the same ingredient.  p  precoderecipe 1 uses ingredients 1, 2 and 3 recipe 2 uses ingredients 1, 3 and 5 codepre  pI want to be able to load the ingredients from the recipe, but emnotem the reverse.p  pI think I need to model this as a ManyToMany relation by creating a separate entity to track all the recipe lt ingredient mappings.  p  pstrongIs my understanding correct, or is there some way to make this work with a ToMany relationstrongp  pI dont think using a single ToMany relation will work, because GreenDao requires them to have a foreign key in the target entity back to the original entity see Modelling ToMany Relations in the a hrefhttpgreendaoorm.comdocumentationrelations relnofollowdocsa.  This means that ingredients can only refer to a single recipe  as soon as two recipes reference the same ingredient then one of them will lose its relation.  p  pFTR, if you dont set up the foreign key in the target entity, then the ToMany relation is lost after restarting the application i.e. it only works for the current database session.  Tip to simulate this scenario in your automated tests, just call codedaoSession.clearcode before loading the object and asserting that it contains the values you expect.p

Negative 345 pI have been playing around with the MNIST digit recognition dataset and I am kind of stuck. I read through some research papers and implemented what all I understood. Basically what I  did was that I first created my training set and crossvalidation sets for evaluating my classifier, then I ran PCA on both my test and train set and after that I used KNN and SVM to perform the classification task. The main problem I am facing is that should I run PCA on all of the set and then separate my training set and cross validation set or separate them and then run PCA individually on the crossvalidation test and training sets. I apologize for asking the things that I have already tried because I have tried out both the scenarios, in the first case my classifier performs brilliantly, because I guess PCA uses the test data set while creating the principle components which tweaks my results and is probably the reason for bias in my model, in the other case the performance is round about 20 to 30 which is very low. So I am kind of stuck how should I refine my model, any help and guidance is highly appreciated, I have pasted my code below for reference.p  precodelibraryggplot2 librarye1071 libraryElemStatLearn libraryplyr libraryclass  import.csv lt functionfilename   returnread.csvfilename, sep  ,, header  TRUE, stringsAsFactors  FALSE   train.data lt import.csvtrain.csv test.data lt train.data[3000132000,] train.data lt train.data[16000,]  Performing PCA on the dataset to reduce the dimensionality of the data  getPCA lt functiondataset   dataset.features lt dataset[,colnamesdataset in clabel]   features.unit.variance lt namesdataset[, sapplydataset, functionv varv, na.rmTRUE0]   dataset.features lt dataset[,colnamesdataset in features.unit.variance]   pr.comp lt prcompdataset.features, retx  T, center  T, scale  T   finding the total variance contained in the principal components   princomp lt summarypr.comp   princomp.sdev lt data.frameprincompsdev   printpaste0age of variance contained  , sumprincomp.sdev[1500,]sumprincomp.sdev   screeplotpr.comp, type  lines, main  Principal Components   num.of.comp  50   red.dataset lt princompx   red.dataset lt red.dataset[,1num.of.comp]   red.dataset lt data.framered.dataset   returnred.dataset   Perform kfold cross validation   docvclass lt functiondf, k, classifier   numofnn  gsub[[digit]],,classifier   classifier  gsub[[digit]],,classifier   ifnumofnn          classifier  cgetpred,classifier      else        classifier  cgetpredk,classifier     numofnn  as.numericnumofnn      classifier  pasteclassifier,collapse     funcname lt classifier   output  vector   sizedistr  c   n  nrowdf   fori in 1n        a  1  i1  nk     b  ink     sizedistr  appendsizedistr, b  a  1       rownum  1n   sampling  list   fori in 1k        s  samplerownum,sizedistr     sampling[[i]]  s     rownum  setdiffrownum,s      prediction.df  data.frame   outcome.list  list    fori in 1k        testSample  sampling[[i]]     trainset  df[testSample,]     testset  df[testSample,]          ifnumofnn              classifier  match.funclassifier       result  classifiertrainset,testset       confusion.matrix lt tablepred  result, true  testsetlabel       accuracy lt sumdiagconfusion.matrix100sumconfusion.matrix       printconfusion.matrix       outcome lt listsampleID  i, Accuracy  accuracy       outcome.list lt rbindoutcome.list, outcome          else             classifier  match.funclassifier       result  classifiertrainset,testset       printclassresult       confusion.matrix lt tablepred  result, true  testsetlabel       accuracy lt sumdiagconfusion.matrix100sumconfusion.matrix       printconfusion.matrix       outcome lt listsampleID  i, Accuracy  accuracy       outcome.list lt rbindoutcome.list, outcome           returnoutcome.list   Support Vector Machines with linear kernel  getpredsvm lt functiontrain, test   digit.class.train lt as.factortrainlabel   train.features lt train[,trainlabel]   test.features lt test[,testlabel]   svm.model lt svmtrain.features, digit.class.train, cost  10, gamma   0.0001, kernel  radial   svm.pred lt predictsvm.model, test.features   returnsvm.pred   KNN model getpredknn lt functiontrain,test   digit.class.train lt as.factortrainlabel   train.features lt train[,colnamestrain in label]   test.features lt test[,colnamestrain in label]   knn.model lt knntrain.features, test.features, digit.class.train   returnknn.model  codepre  pp

Negative 345 pThere is no code for this example as of yet because Im after a conceptual answer.p  pSay I have an MVC application hosted at mydomain.com. I have a set of admin tools that are available at mydomain.comadmin. There is an attribute on the admin controller that looks for a session variable indicating whether the user is logged in or not. If not it redirects to a login page, sets the session variable and all is good. Im fine with this .. I understand how it works.p  pNow say that I have another subapplication at mydomainblog. This is a separate virtual directory that has a similar security mechanism that locks down mydomainblogadmin.p  pIf a user is logged into mydomainadmin ie the session variable is set can I then redirect them to blogadminindex in such a way that the session variable is passed through to this separate application. My assumption is that the session variables for the two virtual directories are distinct.p  pThe essence of this is a way to add modular tools to a web application. If a module is installed, I want to place a link or menu that will take them to the specific modules toolset without having to authenticate again.p  pOne caveat, this would more than likely have to work with shared hosting scenarios where I may not have access to IIS configuration. In the scenario where I do have IIS access I would obviously have other options that I understand, but I specifically need this to work without that level of control or access.p  pI hope that makes sense. Please ask for any clarification.p  pThanks. Simon.p

Negative 345 pIn Rails 4, I am trying to figure out how to best redirect a Devise user after a successful OmniAuth Facebook login.p  pWhen a user logs in to my app for the first time with OmniAuthFacebook, I have to set some variables such as username in their user model to some default, but I want the user to confirm or change these default.  For example, if there is a Facebook nickname, I will use that to set their required username in their user model, or First Name  Last Name if no nickname is available.p  pIf the user is logging in for the first time with Facebook, Ive just created their user model in the database, and I want to redirect them to the account editing page, with a flash message saying something to the effect of Update your account to complete your registration.  If the user has logged in previously, Ill assume theyve already been informed about their default username and are aware of it, so I will just redirect them to their default destination.p  pI gather that this is the typical starting pointp  precodeclass UsersOmniauthCallbacksController lt DeviseOmniauthCallbacksController     def facebook              You need to implement the method below in your model e.g. appmodelsuser.rb         user  User.findforfacebookoauthrequest.env[omniauth.auth], currentuser          if user.persisted             signinandredirect user, event authentication this will throw if user is not activated             setflashmessagenotice, success, kind Facebook if isnavigationalformat         else             session[devise.facebookdata]  request.env[omniauth.auth]             redirectto newuserregistrationurl         end     end end codepre  pI know that I can override aftersigninpathfor, but it doesnt know the result of my call to User.findforfacebookoauth.  If I knew that a new user was created by User.findforfacebookoauth, I could redirect them to the account editing page via an overridden aftersigninpathfor method so they could review any defaults and make changes.  I know that I can solve this problem by putting a flag in the database schema for the user model, but this seems like overkill.  For example, I could add a new database field for isnewuser, which would be enabled when User.findforfacebookoauth saves a new user, which is read by aftersigninpathfor, and disabled whenever the account editing page is viewed.  I dont like this approach and would prefer it if aftersigninpathfor knew what happened during the current omniauth request, and act accordingly.  Theres no need for me to add a field to the database.p  pI hope this makes sense.  Thanks for any suggestionsp

However as this will execute after the object has been saved I lose knowledge of the past values.p  pIs there a different approach I could take to achieve something like thisp

Negative 345 pSo Im currently messing around with using LazyLoading in angularJS with AngularAMD, Require.js, and AngularRoute, and I keep running into an error when html5Mode is enabled. When html5Mode is off, everything works fine. However, if its on, the route will change and work the first time, but if you refresh the page it will give a 404 error.p  pFor Example, if Im at html5ModeOn p  precodehttplocalhostLazyLoading codepre  pIt will show the normal H1 and the two links. If i click the link to go to page two, it will change the url, and update the page. At this point, if I refresh, the page goes blank, and the console says p  precodeNetworkError 404 Not Found  httplocalhostLazyLoadingpage2 codepre  pIf I turn html5Mod off, and do the same thing, only with  in the url obviously, everything works fine.

Negative 345 pI have a customer who has a production and development SQL Server database, but only one SSRS server with different folders for prod and dev reports. So same reports in each folder, but a set of reports in one folder points to prod data, and the reports in the other folder point to dev data. I deploy all the reports from BIDS using the MYDATASOURCEDEV datasource, and then change all the shared and local datasets to use the  MYDATASOURCEPROD datasource, change the deploy folder to the prod folder and deploy them. This is a pain since there are many datasets.p  pIs there a way to bulk change all the datasets, local and shared in a project I have to have 2 datasources on the server, since there is only one server yet there is prod and dev data.p  pWhat is the best way to manage thisp  pThanks...p

Negative 345 pI am creating a Hibernate project in IntelliJ IDE and trying to hook it up with a H2 database. I created the project based upon this tutorialp  pa hrefhttpwww.roseindia.nethibernatehibernate4.2hibernateexamplestepbystepineclipse.shtml relnofollowhttpwww.roseindia.nethibernatehibernate4.2hibernateexamplestepbystepineclipse.shtmlap  pThe only change Im making is the database, instead of MySQL, Im using H2. However, when Im trying to run the application, the insertion to the database is shown to have been successful, but there are no signs of any such rows when I open up the database in the H2 console. Ive tried many solutions suggested here and elsewhere, including a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions16417425errorusinghibernatewithh2inmemorydatabasethisa, a hrefhttpstackoverflow.coma2011544thisa and a hrefhttpstackoverflow.coma5332242thisa. Ive tried changing the connection URL of the database in the hibernate.cfg.xml file from a relative path to absolute path, but to no avail. Im attaching a screenshot of my hibernate.cfg.xml and the relevant portion of the log below. Please help me out with this.p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comRm3O3.png altenter image description herep

Negative 345 pImagine a web security system that is made up of 5 tables that handle the authorization part of a web appp  ol liUsersli liRolesli liPermissionsli lirolePermissions manytomany between Roles and Permissionsli liuserRoles many to many between Users and Rolesli ol  pSometimes a User needs to be granted access to a Permission rule for a short amount of time and then removed again, such as when someone goes away for vacation and someone else needs to take over one of his tasks. The short answer is to create a new Role, assign that Role to the User and when that Role is no longer needed, either remove that Role from the User or delete it completely.p  pI would rather not have to create Roles all the time for something like that. One solution that has been suggested is to have a separate table called userPermissionChanges, which will record thep  ol liuserIDli liPermissionIDli liaddDenyFlag bit NOT NULLli ol  pThe addDenyFlag will be true if this is an extra Permission to be added to the user and false if its a Permission that needs to be removed. Upon querying and caching a Users Permissions at the server scope, we would also includeexclude the changes table and make the necessary changes to each users Permissions.p  pThe suggested solution would theoretically work, but I am not so sure its a good way of dealing with this problem. Does anyone have any suggestions of how to best go about this instead Is there a standard that I should follow for such scenariosp

I just mentioned them if ever they are a concern for this problem.p  pAnyway, what im trying to achieve is I have a submit actionp  precodepublic function actionSubmitDataid       Execute Sql queries here  thisgtrenderview,array                 some data               codepre  pThe problem is that I will be strongprocessing a large amount of datastrong About 50,000 records will be processed in each of 4 tables of roughly 10 columns each table, that is fairly large. The use case is that the user submits, then the sql statements are executed in background, but the view view should already be rendered, not requiring the user to wait for the records to be processed. Heshe can check on it later on after the records are processed.p  pA normal request would execute sql statements first, then render the view. The problem is when the page takes about 35 min. The page never loads and the creation of records is not finished, just a white page appears when the requests are intensive. p  pIn other words, how do I execute sql queries in background Leaving the user able to browse the application still while the request is strongbeing processedstrong And strongsomewhere in the backgroundstrong, records are being processed What is the workaround for this problem Thanksp

Negative 345 pI am struggling to figure out how I can mask one image view to another. I am attempting to mask a chat bubble image view to a image view that contains a picture, exactly like iMessage.p  pI have tried every combination of imageView.layer.mask I can possibly think of and it all fails. The hard part of this is because the bubble image view is made from a stretchable image. I cannot use a regular image mask it doesnt work.p  pAny ideasp

That would drive the user crazy.  I want the page to submit the filters only when a specific button is pressed, not when the values in any of the controls change.  So how can I associate THAT buttons event with the SelectMethodp  pThere may be other auto postback controls on that page that have nothing to do with the databound control.  I sure wouldnt want those controls call SeletMethod.p

Negative 345 pIm trying to use the AD Authenticator in WLS 12.1.2 JAAS container security to handle the scenario where the user has been set to must change password at next logon, which I understand is set in the AD attribute pwdLastSet. If I set that to 0 for a particular user, and then attempt a login to my application, I get a ServletException on the javax.servlet.http.HttpServletRequest.loginusername, password method with a bundled generic FailedLoginException, but I dont get any info regarding the cause. What I really need is the 773 error code from AD or something to indicate to my application code that this is why the request.login method has thrown an exception. Somehow we need to translate this into a javax.naming.AuthenticationException, which is what we would get if we did the LDAP bind manually with a new InitialContext.  It seems a bit strange to have to manually bind to cater for alternate scenarios like this, while the container security handles the generic success scenario.  Any ideasp

Any clue as to what that isp  pJS code belowp  precodevar CALLBACKPTR  function createChartsChartType,sContainerID,oData,oOptions  CALLBACKPTR  null   Load the Visualization API and the piechart package. google.loadvisualization, 1.0,callbackCALLBACKPTR          Set a callback to run when the Google Visualization API is loaded. google.setOnLoadCallbackdrawVisualization   CALLBACKPTR  function        var oDataTable  new google.visualization.arrayToDataTable         oData           var wrapper  new google.visualization.ChartWrapper                      chartType sChartType,             dataTable oDataTable,             optionsoOptions,             containerIdsContainerID                    wrapper.draw       interactivity, will build on this in the future     google.visualization.events.addListenerwrapper,ready,function         var chartwrapper.getChart         google.visualization.events.addListenerchart, select,function                                  var selectedItem  chart.getSelection[0]                         if selectedItem                              var value  oDataTable.getValueselectedItem.row, selectedItem.column                             alertValue  value                                              end inner anon function                      end draw function  end createChart codepre  pThis is all a bit weird but it does work, except for the permission denied thing. This is called from the client page via createChart... whenever they click a button that filters the visible data.p  pThe error you would see in a JS debuggerp  precodeSCRIPT70 Permission denied  formaten,defaulten.I.js, line 83 character 16 codepre  pClicking it takes me to Googles obfuscated codep  precodeif1a[ed] codepre  pAnd if I hover over a all the attributes id,name,etc say permission denied under the value.p  pAny input would be appreciated.p  pP.S. Doesnt it make sense to call google.load AFTER you define your callback function Whether you use callback or setOnLoadCallback, why wouldnt you first define the callback Especially in my case where it changes.p  pFeel free to critique the interactivity code I had to write due to using a wrapper, since wrapper.getChart doesnt work until wrapper is ready, I had to wrap my chart listener in the wrapper ready listener.p  pbEDITbp  pI tried simplifying it top  precodefunction createChartsChartType,sContainerID,oData,oOptions  ifCHART     clear the old chart TODO, what if they want to generate multiple charts     CHART.clearChart   CALLBACKPTR  null CALLBACKPTR  function        var oDataTable  new google.visualization.arrayToDataTable         oData           CHART  new google.visualization.LineChartdocument.getElementByIdsContainerID.       drawoDataTable, oOptions        end draw function        Load the Visualization API and the piechart package.     google.loadvisualization, 1.0,packages[corechart],callbackCALLBACKPTR end function createChart codepre  pBut still no luck..still get permission denied even with the clearing the chart references some others suggested in other posts.p  pbANOTHER EDITb The code above is bad, the linep  precodeCHART  new google.visualization.LineChartdocument.getElementByIdsContainerID.   drawoDataTable, oOptions codepre  pShould bep  precodeCHART  new google.visualization.LineChartdocument.getElementByIdsContainerID     CHART.drawoDataTable, oOptions codepre  pOtherwise CHART was whatever .draw returned, meaning my .clearChart wasnt working.p  pSo now that ithati works, is there a clearWrapper equivalent Because my original code used a wrapper so that callers can pass in a chart type and not need to worry about maintaining different objects..p

Negative 345 pAs of recently I experience some troubles with Xcodes 6 code editor, which conclude in rapid change of focus in the editing window, jumping to a completely different place in the same file, while editing text. This is how it all started. Lately the editor refuses to scroll up and down, hangs, stops displaying the line numbers, or any other text altogether. What can I do to make it stop misbehave All the solutions I found thus far are concerning older versions of Xcode and do not work for me.p  pstrongUpdatestrong I initially thought it was the Optionals. There is a point in my code where I do thisp  precodetile.position.vertical gt 2 codepre  pI presumed that by comparing the optional to a value, I messed with the compiler and I was supposed to compare it only to nil. Subsequent testing proved me wrong. Then I notices something in one of my enumerationsp  precodeenum Figure Int       case King  0      case Pawn  1      case Bishop  3      case Knight  5      case Rook  7      case Queen  9       func pieceName gt String          switch self          case .Pawn             return Pawn          case .King             return King          case .Bishop             return Bishop          case .Knight             return Knight          case .Rook             return Rook          case .Queen             return Queen                codepre  pNotice how nicely the code gets coloured in the switch statement, obviously Pawn, King and so on are a part of the same enumeration. Well, not in my case. My copy of Xcode will say Symbol not found when I commandclick one of the case values in the function. So, what do you think could this be the culprit to my troubles and if yes, how can I fix itp

Why Is there some state I need to initialize  If I deliberately make the XML file incorrect, standalone validation will fail  and if I comment out validation, parsing also fails  both with SAXParseException, and with the error I expected.p  p[code below edited down from actual stuff with lots of printlns to illustrate the issue]p  pstrongshort.xsdstrongp  precodeltxml version1.0 encodingUTF8 gt ltxsschema xmlnsxshttpwww.w3.org2001XMLSchema            targetNamespacehttpwww.myapp.comsample            xmlnssmphttpwww.myapp.comsample            elementFormDefaultqualified            attributeFormDefaultunqualifiedgt   ltxselement nameSample typexsstringgt ltxsschemagt codepre  pstrongshort.xmlstrongp  precodeltxml version1.0gt ltSample   xmlnshttpwww.myapp.comsample   xmlnsxsihttpwww.w3.org2001XMLSchemainstance   xsischemaLocationhttpwww.myapp.comsample shortxsd.xsd gt   hello ltSamplegt codepre  pstrongSourcestrongp  precodeimport javax.xml.XMLConstants import javax.xml.parsers.ParserConfigurationException import javax.xml.parsers.SAXParser import javax.xml.parsers.SAXParserFactory import javax.xml.transform.Source import javax.xml.transform.stream.StreamSource import javax.xml.validation.Schema import javax.xml.validation.SchemaFactory import javax.xml.validation.Validator import org.xml.sax.SAXException import org.xml.sax.SAXParseException import org.xml.sax.helpers.DefaultHandler  public static void mainString... args       throws IOException        String xsdFileName  shortxsd.xsd     URL xsdURL  Thread.currentThread.getContextClassLoader.getResourcexsdFileName     String xsdPath  xsdURL.getPath     System.out.printlnxsdFileName   xsdFileName     System.out.printlnxsdURL   xsdURL     System.out.printlnxsdPath   xsdPath      String xmlFileName  shortxml.xml     URL xmlURL  Thread.currentThread.getContextClassLoader.getResourcexmlFileName     String xmlPath  xmlURL.getPath     System.out.printlnxmlFileName   xmlFileName     System.out.printlnxmlURL   xmlURL     System.out.printlnxmlPath   xmlPath       Schema creation      SchemaFactory schemaFactory  SchemaFactory.newInstanceXMLConstants.W3CXMLSCHEMANSURI     Schema schema  null     try        schema  schemaFactory.newSchemanew FilexsdURL.getFile          catch SAXException ex        System.out.printlnSchema creation exception   ex       return          System.out.println Schema creation OK       Standalone Validation      Validator validator  schema.newValidator     Source xmlFile  new StreamSourcexmlURL.openStream     try        validator.validatexmlFile          catch SAXException ex        System.out.printlnValidation exception   ex       return          System.out.println Standalone Validation OK       Parsing with validation      SAXParserFactory parserFactory  SAXParserFactory.newInstance     parserFactory.setSchemaschema     SAXParser saxParser  null     try        saxParser  parserFactory.newSAXParser          catch ParserConfigurationException             SAXException ex        System.out.printlnParser creation exception   ex       return          System.out.println Parser creation OK      try InputStream xmlInput  xmlURL.openStream        saxParser.parsexmlInput, new DefaultHandler                                        Override                     public void errorSAXParseException e                                            System.out.println Error   e                                      catch SAXException ex        System.out.printlnParsing exception   ex       return          System.out.println Parsing OK    codepre  pstrongOutputstrongp  precodexsdFileName shortxsd.xsd xsdURL file...targetclassesshortxsd.xsd xsdPath ...targetclassesshortxsd.xsd xmlFileName shortxml.xml xmlURL file...targetclassesshortxml.xml xmlPath ...targetclassesshortxml.xml  Schema creation OK  Standalone Validation OK  Parser creation OK  Error org.xml.sax.SAXParseException lineNumber 6 columnNumber 2 cvcelt.1 Cannot find the declaration of element Sample.

Negative 345 pHello i am trying to convert a pdf book about programming to mobi format with Calibre.p  pThe problem I am facing is that the code blocks inside the converted version completely lose indentation.p  pI managed with a regular expression to correctly indent the lines that where indented using white spaces. I did so transforming every two white spaces to two nonbreakingspaces.p  pSome of the code blocks unfortunately are indented using the tab character, so the regular expression is not working in these cases.p  pI came to realize that during the conversion from pdf to mobi there is an intermediate step in which the pdf is converted to hmtl and there is when the tab information is lost because no special tag is being generated to carry this information.p  pSo i think the best solution is to edit the very pdf itself and replace all the tab characterst to two white spaces ss. This way the regular expression i mentioned before will work for all the code block references and the code will be indented properly.p  pbut i have no idea which software to use that has this functionality of substituting pdf elements.p

The class represents an item in a Research Tree where prerequisite research must be completed before the new topic is available.  The tree and topics are not necessarily linear.  You might have to research items 20,400,12,and 15 before gaining access to item 47 so instances whose ids are 20, 400, 12, and 15 would all have to have status1 showing they were complete prior to item 47 having available  1 showing it on the research project selection window.  Since the research tree is populated by reading every file in a directory, and thus in non controlled sequence, I need to populate my index vector with some kind of null pointer assuming nullptr at the moment when the first instance of the class is created.  My original question was, and essentially remains, how to fill the vector with this data.

Compile time to test this would be HUGE, so Im hoping to get it as nearly bug free as possible dont we all before I start that process.p
Negative 345 pASP.NET Web API allows for inmemory integration tests where the applicationundertest and the test fixture are both in the same app domain.  This makes it simple for the test fixture to modify IOC container bindings to have various objects faked during the integration test.p  pIn contrast, ASP.NET MVC was not designed to allow inmemory integration tests.  Steve Sanderson devised his a hrefhttpsgithub.comcvrajeeshMvcIntegrationTestFramework relnofollowMVC Integration Test Frameworka to provide this capability.  However, it appears that framework causes the MVC application to be running within an appdomain that is separate from the test fixture.  p  pHas anyone devised a way to have the testfixture be in control of IOC container bindings, and still affect the target application despite the fact that it is in a separate app domainp

Negative 345 pnbspnbspnbspnbspI think I met more likely a mathematical problem rather than a algorithm problem. The question description is as follow,p  p nbspnbspnbspnbspIn a game theres a box that produces 2 coins per second. The goal is to reach A number of coins. It cost B number of coins to upgrade, after which the number of coins produced per second is increased by C, and player can upgrade unlimited number of times by paying B coins. Write code to give optimal upgrades and find shortest runtime for the solution in terms of A, B and C.   p  pnbspnbspnbspnbspFor example, it costs 6 coins to let the box produce 2 more coins per second, and the target is to reach 50 coins.

Negative 345 pHopefully someone knows the answer...p  pstrongBACKGROUNDstrongp  pI have created a small routine in PHP that encrypts a large file using the cipher AES, key length 256bits and the block cipher CBC. Now, because the file is very large I could not feed the whole file to the encrypt routine memory overflow so I had to chunk the file in 4128 bytes at a time and to send each block to the encrypt routine. The resulted encrypted blocks become 412816 bytes long 16 from AES padding and I wrote them into a file a chain of blocks  encrypted file.p  pNormally, if I would encrypt that file via openssl it would pad only the last block. In my case, because I had to read one block at a time, I had to do it each block remember that AES pads with 128bits as AES uses a fixed block of 128bits.p  pstrongTHE PROBLEMstrongp  pI am trying to decrypt this file by using the openssl utility. The problem is that the openssl has no idea that my encrypted file is not padded only at the end but every block of 412816 bytes. So it will remove the last block padding but every other block contains 16 bytes more lets call them garbage. If I encode a plaintext file I would see the garbage and I would understand thats a decryption problem. If the file is binary a picture, an executable, whatever then the file probably will not be interpretedloaded.p  pstrongTHE QUESTIONstrongp  pDoes openssl utility have any option that allows me to tell it that the input file must be decoded in blocks of Xbytes at a time instead the whole file Do you see any other solution for this kind of problemp

Negative 345 pId like to begin by saying that this shopping cart is not created by me, however it is changed in the way that I need and I understand most of the code and how it works and all the functions and methods are mine. The things I dont understand I hope to learn with you guys. This is going to be a long and indepth post but I hope you will be as much interested in teaching me as I am in learning from you. p  pstrongBackgroundstrongp  pI have an ecommerce project in which I need to create a shopping cart for the products to be stored in. The process goes like this indexpagewith all the productsdetailspagedetails of the selected productsummaryThe shopping cart with selected products.p  pstrongThe questionsstrongp  pI have a few questions commented in my code that are just simple questions regarding the shopping cart that I didnt create. I hope you can help me understand them.p  pstrongThe problemstrongp  pThere are a few problems with the code, but I probably can figure out everything once the biggest problem is fixedp  pWhen I add my first product to the cart it works like a charm, I am able to display the prices, discounts and everything I need and I even can delete it. After adding the second product the loop doubles. That means that instead of Product1, Product2 I am getting Product1, Product2, Product1, Product2. The same goes with 3 products and etc. This is the biggest problem. Theres one more strange thing. Doing dump on both cart and productsyou will learn about them later I am getting only 2 values in arrays the way it supposed to. That means the problem is somewhere in the twigp  pNow with the code.

Negative 345 pIm working on a plugin for wordpress that I would like to fire every time a custom post of the type job is posted, published, edited, trashed, untrashed, etc. basically whenever there is an update to that post type.p  pIm having a bit of trouble finding the correct action hook to call. I have searched, and from my understanding I cant use for example publishpost because I am using a custom post type, so it should be something along the lines of publishjob.

Negative 345 pDue to some dynamic SQL complications, I have a need to join two tables together and query from the result as if it were a single table. The twist is that I have to codeSELECT code on the inner query  I cant alias the columns.

Negative 345 pI wrote a test animation program that has 500 translucent ellipses floating randomly. The main purpose of this is to test the performance of a software vector graphics library. I get around 170 FPS, which is good enough.p  pFirst I draw the whole frame in plain memory. Then I need a way to transfer this data to the video memory that the monitor accesses. It would be nice and simple to codememcpycode to the video memory directly, but no modern operating system will allow this. I can think of 2 options here.p  pThe first one is to use the system blitting function, such as codeBitBltcode in Windows or codeXPutImagecode in Unix systems.p  pThe second is to copy the whole frame to the GPU as an OpenGL texture, and then draw the whole texture to the screen.p  pI tested both using the equivalent SDL wrappings. The performance in speed is nearly the same, as most of the time is spent on creating the frame to be drawn.p  pOne noticeable difference is that going through the GPU produces a lot more smoother result. I see not 0 but less tearings. One possible reason I can think of is that maybe the moving of pixels from the GPU to the video memory is treated specially for maximum speed, differently from normal memory copying, so that the screen appears more instantly.p  pSo back to the title of this question, how is pixel data transferred from the GPU to the video memory Is it just like a simple call to codememcpycode or are there some special treatings applied If so, what are thosep

Negative 345 pIm looking for input as to why this breaks.  See the addendum for contextual information, but I dont really think it is relevant.p  pI have an codestdvectorltuint16tgt depthbuffercode that is initialized to have 640480 elements.  This means that the total space it takes up is code640480sizeofuint16t  614400code.p  pThe code that breaksp  precodevoid Kinect360DepthCallbackvoid depth, uint32t timestamp      lockguardltmutexgt depthdatalockdepthmutex      uint16t depth  staticcastltuint16tgtdepth     stdcopydepth, depth  depthBufferSize, depthbuffer.begin the error     newdepthframe  true  codepre  pwhere codedepthBufferSizecode will return 614400 Ive verified this multiple times.p  pMy understanding of codestdcopyfirst, amount, outcode is that codefirstcode specifies the memory address to start copying from, codeamountcode is how far in bytes to copy emuntilem, and codeoutcode is the memory address to start copying to.p  pOf course, it can be done manually with something likep  precodepragma unroll forauto i  0 i lt 640480 i depthbuffer[i]  depth[i] codepre  pinstead of the call to codestdcopycode, but Im really confused as to why codestdcopycode fails here.  Any thoughtsp  hr  pAddendum the context is that I am writing a derived class that inherits from codeFreenectDevicecode to work with a Kinect 360.  Officially the error is a codeBus Errorcode, but Im almost certain this is because libfreenect interprets an error in the codeDepthCallbackcode as a codeBus Errorcode.  Stepping through with codelldbcode, its a standard coderuntimeerrorcode being thrown from codestdcopycode.  If I manually enter codedepth  614400code it will crash, though if I have codedepth  640480code it will chug along.  At this stage I am not doing something meaningful with the depth data rendering the raw depth emappropriatelyem with OpenGL is a separate issue xD, so it is hard to tell if emeverythingem got copied, or just a portion.  That said, Im almost positive it doesnt grab it all.p  pContrasted with the corresponding codeVideoCallbackcode and the call inside of codecopyvideo, video  videoBufferSize, videobuffer.begincode, I dont see why the above would crash.  If my understanding of codestdcopycode were wrong, this should crash too since codevideoBufferSizecode is going to return code6404803sizeofuint8t  6404803  921600code.  The code3code is from the fact that we have 3 codeuint8tcodes per pixel, RGB no A.  The codeVideoCallbackcode works swimmingly, as verified with OpenGL and the fact that its essentially identical to the samples provided with libfreenect....  FYI none of the samples I have found actually work with the raw depth data directly, all of them colorize the depth and use an codestdvectorltuint8tgtcode with RGB channels, which does not suit my needs for this project.p  hr  pIm happy to just ignore it and move on in some senses because I can get it to work, but Im really quite perplexed as to why this breaks.  Thanks for any thoughtsp

Negative 345 pI have met a bug in applying of codeStyleLookupcode in codeTTabControlcode nested in FMX Frame. The appearance of the control does not accept the style if the frame with the control is nested in a codeHorzScrollBoxcode and at form creation the position of the frame is outside the visible area of the form. In other words if the control is visible when the form is shown the control is painted with necessary style appearance otherwise   not.p  pTo reproduce the bugp  ol liCreate a new grid metropolis application.li liCreate a Frame and put a TTabControl on it. Set codeAligncode of the codeTabControlcode to codealClientcode. Add, say, 4 TTabItems.li liOpen detail form, and set its width to a value  your Screen.Width for me 2500 was enough.li liCopypaste any of the Columns Layouts, say, 2 times and use the most right layout to nest a frame in it. You will see normal presentation of tabitems at designtime. Set style settings. You will get the following pictureli ol  pa hrefhttpi.stack.imgur.comxhLeI.png relnofollowimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comxhLeI.png altenter image description hereap  pDone. Run the project. You will get the bug. At runtime the appearance of TabItem is like thisp  pa hrefhttpi.stack.imgur.commTSAk.png relnofollowimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.commTSAk.png altenter image description herea p  pIf you set the StyleLookup manually at runtime the appearance might either not change either be set to every other item for example 1st, 3rd and not set to 2nd and 4th though you assign the same StyleLookup to all TabItems. The other interesting finding. If you have other forms containing codeTabControlscode with codeTabItemscode nested without frames and closer to left border of the form for example Form2, you get the following. If you show the faulty Form1 at runtime first you will see the bug, but if you close this form and show Form2 you see proper codeTabControlcode. Closing Form2 and showing Form1 faulty afterwards will give you a proper appearance of TabControl in a faulty form.  It has something in common with the bug reported by me earlier a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comq317233445043424Incorrect selection of items in an FMX TListbox Grid Metropolis UI.a It is still not fully solved.

Negative 345 pWe are developing a new web application from scratch using Spring Boot and relevant dependencies and is built using Gradle.p  pOur project has almost 5 stages of testing, with each stage executing on a different server and thus end up with slightly different configuration on each server.p  pThe above scenario is a very common situation and usually it is a practice I followed in my earlier projects to save the Properties file directly under the servers classpath so that the same .war file can be deployed on multiple servers and still have different configuration based on the serverenvironment.p  pNow, the obvious disadvantage with the above setup is that  such a setup cannot be easily shared with other developers through some version controller. And further I cant use the power of Process Resources task in Gradle to introduce some dynamic properties during build process.p  pNow, If I pull the .properties file within the project setup, then I can easily version control it, sharing becomes easier and I also can introduce dynamic properties through Gradle. The disadvantage being that I might have to prepare multiple .war files after updating the .properties file.p  pThere are two questions I havep  ol liWhat would be your thought on the above 2 ways Given this situation what would you choose and why Any other way of dealing with this scenarioli liIn the 2nd case of building multiple .war files, how do i rerun the war task to generate a new output fileli ol  pThanksp
Negative 345 pemPlease note this is a question about internals of compilers.emp  pI just read [1] that when introducing variance for generic types C team was thinking whether they should automatically compute if the type is co or contravariant. Of course this is a history now, but nevertheless I am wondering how could this be donep  pIs taking all methods excluding constructors and checking if the type is in codeincode or codeoutcode position enoughp  p[1] Jeffrey Richter, CLR via C, 4th edition, p.281.p

Negative 345 pIm trying to come up with an answer to a recent a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions32619833howtohideshowgridviewrowsonclickofheaderelementwithjavascriptquestiona of mine and I believe the best answer involves a function peeking at the first child element and then setting a bool outside of that function for another function to use.p  pTo recap I have a GridView that has a structure like this p  ul lipgroupheaderp  ul lipdeptheaderp  ul lisome person entityli lisome person entityli lisome person entityli ulli lipdeptheaderp  ul lisome person entityli lisome person entityli lisome person entityli ulli ulli lipgroupheaderp  ul lipdeptheaderp  ul lisome person entityli lisome person entityli lisome person entityli ulli lipdeptheaderp  ul lisome person entityli lisome person entityli lisome person entityli ulli ulli ul  pBasically, I want it so that when groupheader is clicked it hides all the following rows until the next groupheader if they arent hidden, else shows them. p  pI have the code and HTML set up at a hrefhttpsjsfiddle.netdLp47mtd1 relnofollowhttpsjsfiddle.netdLp47mtd1a, but the code in question that is not expandingcollapsing is p  precode HideShow Groups Data on Click function      .groupheader.clickfunction           Assume first deptheader not visible         var nextVisible  0          Check if the first deptheader is visible         this.firstChildfunction              var el  this              If visible, change our assumption             if el.style.display                    nextVisible  1                                 If visible, hide all subelements else show all subelements         this.nextUntil.groupheader.eachfunction              var el  this                 if nextVisible  1                  el.style.display  none              else                  el.style.display                               codepre
Negative 345 pI have a WatchKit Application that grabs the users calendar events and displays them in a list. The app runs pretty fast when there arent a lot of events 1015 events, but when multiple events and multiple calendars are involved 30 events, the scrolling becomes very laggy and the list keeps constantly refreshing.p  pObviously the watch wasnt designed to handle a lot of data at once, so the only options I considered are having a Loading... label or animation to display while the data is being retrieved, or I could run the data retrieval in the background on the iOS app, and then send the data to the watch kit app when its done, because the iOS app can retrieve the data a lot faster.p  pIm leaning toward the second option, the only problem is how do I implement this. Should I use app groupsp
Negative 345 pIs it possible to make simple variables from dictionaries Something likep  precodedct  key1 val1, key2 val2 codepre  pshould be turned to the variables key1 and key2, so thatp  precodeprint key1 val1 print key2 val2 codepre  pWhy it may be important In my case because of readability.p  pIm implementing multiple design standards in my project, to design well, stuff.p  pTo separate the design code from the physical object being calculated I use interface functions, that get some of the objects that describe the physical object, extract the data needed and return these as dictionaries to be used in the functions doing the standardbased calculation.p  pUsing dictionaries for this makes passing arguments easy positional arguments would be a nightmare, kwargs yields the same problem that I have now, but results unreadable code when it comes to implementing the formulae in the standard.p  pAn example, a rather simple formulap  precoderet  d[Da]  d[p]  20  d[K]  d[S]  d[v]  d[p]  d[c1]  d[c2] codepre  pvs. p  precoderet  Da  p  20  K  S  v  p  c1  c2 codepre  pAnother solution would be to make a class instead of the dict, using type. That would result in something likep  precoderet  c.Da  c.p  20  c.K  c.S  c.v  c.p  c.c1  c.c2 codepre  pThis is better, but not by much.p  pTo avoid the visual noise, now I simply define new variables from all keyvalue pairs passed from the interface function, likep  precodeDa  d[Da] p  d[p] codepre  petc.p  pThis solution is surely not the best, although it leads to easy to read code  but I couldnt come up with a magical one. Do you have any suggestions how to do this transformation simplyp
