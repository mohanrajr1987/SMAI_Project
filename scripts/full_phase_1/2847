Is there any good way to deal with this problem, other than making everything I need to access public  Some way to template a friend declaration, perhapsp  pExample code to demonstrate the problem followsp  precodeinclude ltstdio.hgt  class FunctorA  class FunctorB   template ltclass ItemType, class Functorgt class MyContainer  public    MyContainer  metaData0  empty      templateltclass RHSFunctorgt void CopyFromconst MyContainerltItemType, RHSFunctorgt amp copyFrom           metaData  copyFrom.metaData       item      copyFrom.item      private   int metaData   ItemType item   int mainint argc, char  argv     MyContainerltvoid , FunctorAgt containerA    MyContainerltvoid , FunctorBgt containerB     containerA.CopyFromcontainerB   error, containerACopyFrom cant access containerBs private data    return 0  codepre
Negative 2847 pA HTML page is created using JSF and facelets xhtml. There are 2 hforms that goes to different places. The user enters data on one form and presses the Enter key.  Here is where it gets tricky. On IE 6 and above, either the forms action gets submitted which usually points to the page you are on which then just reloads the page, or the first hcommandbuttonlink that is on the page. Its totally random, but its consistant on that page.p  pHere is what I have tried, I tried placing the components that have to be submitted in their own form...it works but not everywhere. Then I tried creating a hidden input with the id of the button, it works quite effectively, but it is then bypassed somehow by IE trying to invoke the first button on the page. I tried a product called j4j that supposedly creates a default action, but it doesnt work, outputting the tag itself in the rendered HTML. When it does work, it creates javascript they looks for key 13, and then invokes oamsubmit...., which incidently I tried also with varying degrees of success.p  pIs there a solution out there that work permanently Have I missed something or am I not understanding JSF p

Negative 2847 pI read all the questions related to this topic, and they all give reasons why a default constructor on a codestructcode is not available in C, but I have not yet found anyone who suggests a general course of action when confronted with this situation.p  pThe obvious solution is to simply convert the codestructcode to a codeclasscode and deal with the consequences.p  pAre there other options to keep it as a codestructcodep  pI ran into this situation with one of our internal commerce API objects. The designer converted it from a codeclasscode to a codestructcode, and now the default constructor which was private before leaves the object in an invalid state.p  pI thought that if were going to keep the object as a codestructcode, a mechanism for checking the validity of the state should be introduced something like an codeIsValidcode property. I was met with much resistance, and an explanation of whoever uses the API should not use the default constructor, a comment which certainly raised my eyebrows. Note the object in question is constructed properly through static factory methods, and all other constructors are codeinternalcode.p  pstrongIs everyone simply converting their codestructcodes to codeclasscodees in this situation without a second thoughtstrongp  pEdit I would like to see some suggestions about how to keep this type of object as a codestructcode  the object in question above is much better suited as a codestructcode than as a codeclasscode.p
Negative 2847 pThis probably applies to other places, but in WinForms, when I use binding I find many methods want to take the name of the property to bind to. Something likep  precodeclass Person      public String Name  get  ...  set  ...       public int Age  get  ...  set  ...     class PersonView      void BindPerson p              nameControl.Bindp,Name         ageControl.Bindp,Age       codepre  pThe big problem I keep having with this is that Name and Age are specified as strings. This means the compiler is no help if someone renames one of Persons properties. The code will compile fine, but the bindings will be broken.p  pIs there a standard way of solving this that Ive missed It feels like I need some keyword, maybe called stringof to match the existing typeof. You could use it something likep  precodeageControl.Bindp,stringofp.Age.Name codepre  pstringof could return some class that has properties for getting the full path, part of the path, or the string so you can parse it up yourself.p  pIs something like this already doablep

Negative 2847 pI am going back and forth with setting an element to codeminOccurs0code and codenillabletruecode.p  pI was reading a hrefhttpwww.ibm.comdeveloperworkswebserviceslibrarywstipnull.htmlthisa article and now in my WSDL Im not sure if using both is worth it. The article gives a good example of representing arrays where you might have null values interspersed throughout, as this cant be done with just codeminOccurs0code. Now, the convention Ive been going with is that if an element isnt optional it is not nillable.  The difference as I understand it, and where my question lies, is that by applying the nillable property to an element, I am saying that you can pass in the XSD equivalent of a NULL value Otherwise, an element without the nillable property, has to have a value within the restriction placed on itp

Negative 2847 pThis one is pretty crazyp  pIve got an AppSight recording for those not familiar, its a recording of what they did including keyboardmouse input  network traffic, etc of a customer reproducing a bug.  Basically, weve got a series of items listed on the screen with JCheckBoxes down the left side.  Weve got a MouseListener set for the JPanel that looks something like thisp  precodeprivate MouseAdapter createMouseListener      return new MouseAdapter         public void mousePressed MouseEvent e                if e.getComponent instanceof JCheckBox                    Do stuff                             codepre  pBased on the recording, it appears very strongly that they click just above one of the checkboxes.  After that, its my belief that this listener fired and the Do stuff block happened.  However, it did NOT check the box.  The user then saw that the box was unchecked, so they clicked on it.  This caused the Do stuff block to fire again, thus undoing what it had done the first time.  This time, the box was checked.  Therefore, the user thinks that the box is checked, and it looks like it is, but our client thinks that the box is unchecked as it was clicked twice.p  pIs this possible at all  For the life of me, I cant reproduce it or see how it could be possible, but based on the recording and the data the client sent to the server, I cant see any other logical explanation.p  pAny help, thoughts, and or ideas would be much appreciated.p

Negative 2847 pBoth the systems described are Windows XP with Lotus Notes 8.5.p  pI have a Java app sample code below that uses notes.jar to interact with Lotus Notes. The app works fine on a system that has codenotes.inicode in the Lotus install dir of codecProgram FilesLotusNotescode and the user ID file is in codecProgram FilesLotusNotesDatacode.

Negative 2847 pIm in the process of setting up a system which will have to repeatedly parse large amounts of text as a String or StringBuffer  which might be better acquired from the a data source. The text will be displayed and may consist of several thousand words and each time the text is parsed, each word may have to checked against a list of 550 stop words. This will allow the words to be filtered from display.p  pSo I wonder about performance as this could be going on in multiple servlet sessions at any one time is it better to check each word against a MySQL database table MyISAM or InnoDB using an index Or simply to store the 550 words in a Java array or arraylist within servlet context so they possibly be read more quickly p  pSo I wonder about the trade off between database IO against storing 550 strings in memory.p  pAny advicep  pThanksp  pMr Morgan. p
Negative 2847 pCurrently I am working on a problem which is implemented as a combination of different modules. Each module is written in C and is supposed to run as separate Process.

Negative 2847 pI currently develop an application providing the possibility to dragampdrop items from one ListBox to an other. This is working perfectly while using a mouse.p  pHowever, when trying to do the same with a touch screen producing genuine touch events this will not work.p  pIn my logs I see that the TouchDown and Move is actually detected. But the call to System.Windows.DragDrop.DoDragDrop does not block as it is the case during mouse usage. It immediately returns, so the drag gesture ends right after it started.p  pI assume that DragDrop.DoDragDrop is geared for mouse usage only and depends on a MouseButtonDown during the complete process of draggingp  pSo, is there an equivalent for using dragampdrop with touch eventsp  pThanks for any hintsp

Negative 2847 pIve found solutions for manipulating everything except what I need. Heres the scenariop  pJust like in GMail  main content is presented in an iframe. Clicking links on the main page targets the iframe. This works well, and seamless.  At this point if I click Back on the browser  the iframe will go back. This is good because cache is involved and the page doesnt redownload.p  pAdding a common logic of modifying the hash breaks everything. Now when you hit back the browser changes the has, but does NOT change the iframe history. Ive tried accessing the history of that particular iframe  codeframes[myiframe].history.backcode but that still changes the hash without changing the iframe source.p  pIve found a sneaky codehistory.replaceStatetemp, , iframelocationcode and this works seamless when clicking links, but going backwards it actually tries to load the iframe location in the main window.p  pIm at a loss. I know GMail does not request all information every time you hit back or forward. So how does it do it Does it use multiple iframes, and change which one is visiblep  pThanksp  pP.S. Tested a simple situation create an iframe, and change a link via some codelta hrefchild targetiframeacode Now change the hash via codelocation.href  somethingcode So far so good. Now if you specifically tell the iframe to go back in history  it will not codeframes[iframe].contentWindow.history.backcode p
Negative 2847 pHeres how I understand asp.net compilation.  Please correct any errors in my understanding.p  pIf I do not publish a web site project, rather simply copy all the files to the web directory I know that the first visit it compiles and so the first visit its a little slow.  From then on if I dont update the source the website stays compiled correct E.G. its not in a cache that expires  p  pWhat if I update the source of a page, somehow ASP.NET detects a change and recompiles  Does it recompile just a single page or put everything in binMySiteName.dllp  pFinally, if I publish a site I cant update the source code aspx yes, but not code behind pages.  This precompiles the site so the first load is quick.  The site is forever compiled until a new publish.p

Negative 2847 pIf I have a master composite custom server control, with several child custom controls, is it possible, for the master control to share its viewstate with the child controls, which are also custom composite server controls,all of the controls are composite custom server controls p  pTo expand a little more, say I have a emPersonem control, emAddressem control, emPhoneem control and emNotesem control. emAddressem, emPhoneem and  emNotesem can exist as either independant controls, or as part of the emPersonem control. Since each control is responsible for its own viewstate, and stores required data in it, so it can renderpostback etc, it ends up that there is a lage duplication in the viewstate, since the Person control stores all the data, and then each child control stores its own data again. Also, to further complicate things, the emPersonem Control adds the child controls dynamically, so its possible to add a 2nd addressphone numbernote etc,which can cause yet a larger viewstateup to 1MB.p  pIn the case of when all the emAddressPhoneetcem controls are children of the the emPersonem Control, is it possible for me to somehow share common viewstate data, so I dont have 234 copies of some stuff in the viewstate, and when they are not components, just act as normalp  pI do have one idea for a solution, but its fairly nasty imo, where I could modify the emPersonem control, expose its viewstate or the data, and then in the child control, would check the control hierarchy, and if the child control is part of a emPersonem, dont use to its own viewstate, use the exposed one. This would require me to rework alot of the existing code, which Id rather avoid if possible.p

Negative 2847 pI am finding that Design View DV is nice, but trying to change the way it automagically injects code into codeInitializeComponentcode is very hard. And sometimes its automagical code breaks the program.p  pFor example, DV automatically sees every single property of my custom UserControl, and then it assigns every single property to some value in codeInitializeComponentcode. But I dont want it to assign values to some of the properties because some of my setters will throw a runtime exception if not used correctly. I could correct codeInitializeComponentcode manually, but anytime I make a change to the design, SharpDevelop will just regenerate the function again.p  pAnd theres another case where I have the Default Constructor set the size based upon certain factors, but then codeInitializeComponentcode will immediately set it to another static value.p  pHow can I tell DV to emnotem automagically assign values to certain properties I definep

Negative 2847 pIm building an iPhone app. I have a UIView that contains a set of UIImageView subclass objects.  The user can drag and rotate the image views via touch.  Im having trouble moving the image view after it has been rotated.p  pTo rotate an image view, I apply a transform rotation, which works fine.  It looks like thisp  precodeCGAffineTransform trans  self.transform self.transform  CGAffineTransformRotatetrans, delta codepre  pThe problem comes later when the user tries to move the element via touch.  In touchesBeganWithEvent, I save the start point in a class variable, startLocationp  precode void touchesBeganNSSettouches withEventUIEventevent          Retrieve the touch point     CGPoint pt  [[touches anyObject] locationInViewself]     startLocation  pt  codepre  pIn touchesMovedwithEvent, I had the following code, which works well enough if there is no rotation transform on the image viewp  precode void touchesMovedNSSettouches withEventUIEventevent      CGPoint pt  [[touches anyObject] locationInViewself]     CGFloat dx  pt.x  startLocation.x     CGFloat dy  pt.y  startLocation.y     CGPoint newCenter  CGPointMakeself.center.x  dx, self.center.y  dy     self.center  newCenter  codepre  pBut if there is a rotation transform on the image view, then the image view thrashes about the screen on each touchesMoved event and soon disappears.  In the debugger, I observed that the value of pt became monstrous.  It occurred to me that I needed to transform that point, which I did, like sop  precode void touchesMovedNSSettouches withEventUIEventevent  CGPoint pt  [[touches anyObject] locationInViewself] if CGAffineTransformIsIdentityself.transform      pt  CGPointApplyAffineTransformpt, self.transform   CGFloat dx  pt.x  startLocation.x CGFloat dy  pt.y  startLocation.y CGPoint newCenter  CGPointMakeself.center.x  dx, self.center.y  dy  codepre  pThis worked much better.  I can drag the image about the screen now.  But the very first movement causes the image to jolt once in one direction or another, depending on the angle of rotation in the transform and the dimensions of the image view.p  pHow can I move the image view without having the initial joltp  pWhy is it that I do not need to transform startLocation the point I capture when touches beganp

The DynamicMatrix would have a constructor that did p  precodedata  new T[rows] for int i  0 i lt rows i      data[i]  new T[cols]  for int i  0 i lt rows i      for int j  0 j lt cols j               data[i][j]  0       codepre  pAnd FixedMatrix justp  precodefor i0 i lt rows i      for j0 j lt cols j               data[i][j]  0           codepre  pCreating a member variable codeT datacode in the base class is easy enough.

Negative 2847 pSuppose we have parent process, codeAcode. codeAcode recives the input codeusernamecode and codepasswordcode and looks them up in a codeAllUserscode database to make sure the codeusernamepasswordcode combination are valid. codeAcode then starts a new child process codeBcode and passes it the codeusernamepasswordcode. codeBcode needs more info from the database, such as the users codeagecode and codenicknamecode.p  pstrongShould codeAcode only be allowed to have database accessstrongp  ul licodeAcode gets all the info from the database and passes it all to codeBcode via command line strings when it creates the new codeBcode.  Even though codeAcode doesnt care about codeagecode and codenicknamecode. codeBcode would parse the strings to grab the fields.li licodeAcode only passes the codeusernamepasswordcode to codeBcode, and codeAcode has WCF services that lets codeBcode call the services, which makes codeAcode access the database and return the info to codeBcode.li ul  pstrongShould codeAcode and codeBcode both have database accessstrongp  ul licodeAcode only hands codeBcode the codeusernamepasswordcode and lets codeBcode access the database so it can get the codeagenicknamecode itself.li ul  pstrongShould we have multiple databasesstrongp  ul licodeAcode only has access to the codeAllUserscode database. But we also have a database for each user. So, 10,000 users  10,000 databases. codeBcode accesses only the one user database for the one user it cares about.li ul  pKeep in mind there will only be one codeAcode but there could be hundreds or thousands of codeBcode processes. I want to keep the load as even as possible, ie, I dont want codeAcode to be a bottleneck if thousands of codeBcodes need to talk to it. But Im also concerned about having two processes access the same database at the same time, seems like it might cause slow access or corrupt data.p  pThese are the ideas I have for how to go about this. Which one is the best Or is there a better approachp

Negative 2847 pSo I am making a simple form form customers to fill out, and I want users to get a preview of what their submission will look like. A great example of this is google adwords, when you are creating a new ad.p  pBasically this has to be done through ajax, updating the preview div depending on what the user has entered into the form fields.

Negative 2847 pA colleague and myself were debating over which way was less of a burden on the system resources. Note this is not the question I want an answer to.

Using KeyPreview to get the keypresses on a form. codepre blockquote  porp  blockquote precode2. Using defining an OnMessage procedure and handling it there. codepre blockquote  pAt first glance it seems KeyPreview would be less of a system burden since defining an OnMessage procedure results in our program checking every message that comes in. Note messages we dont care about would cause it to jump out by the first if statement. That is at worst we would have an if statement executed for every message.p  pstrongBut were wondering how Delphi deals with the KeyPreview property... We wonder if Delphi internally defines its own OnMessage and looks at the messages to then trigger the events that are related to keypresses.strongp  pIf this is the case then would both approaches be about the samep

After that, the survey can be accessed by anyone who uses a special link containing the token of course.p  pSo now to the main question Every token might have an email address associated with itself. How can I safely send emails containing the access link for the survey I might need to send a few thousand emails max. 10 000 I believe. This is an extreme example and such huge mailings would be needed only occasionally. But I also would like to be able to keep track of the email message status was it send or was there any error. I would also like to make sure that the SMTP server doesnt block this mailing. It would also be nice if the application remained responsive  The task should run in background.p  pWhat is the best way to handle that problemp  pAs far as Im concerned, the standard Django mailing feature wont be much help here. People report that setting up a connection and looping through messages calling send on them takes forever. It wouldnt run in background, so I believe that this could have negative impact on the application responsiveness, rightp  pI read about a hrefhttpsgithub.comjtauberdjangomailer relnofollowdjangomailera, but as far as I understood the docs  it doesnt allow to keep track of the message status. Or does itp  pWhat are my other optionsp

Negative 2847 pI have created an ADO.NET data provider that is built using AnyCPU. When referenced directly it works fine on both 64 and 32 bit Windows OS. However, in my installer, I register my DbProviderFactory with the .NET machine.config and place my assemblies in the GAC so users can access the data provider through System.Windows.DbProviderFactories. This works great as long as the application is running as 32bit. It does not work for applications built for x64.p  pThis is what I have found. My installer is targeted for 32 bit. Therefore, my DbProviderFactory only gets added to the 32bit .NET machine.config. In order for x64 applications to use my data provider through the DbProviderFactories, it needs to be registered with the 64bit .NET machine.config.p  pDo I have to have two installers One targeting 32 and the other 64 All of my assemblies are AnyCPU because I dont know or care what platform the users application is.p  pMy somewhat complex solution was this. During the installer, I have custom action that checks if the OS is 64bit a hrefhttpsocial.msdn.microsoft.comForumsencsharpgeneralthread24792cdc2d8e454b9c6831a19892ca53 relnofollowherea. If it is, I want to start a process that runs a 64 bit console app that will add my DbProviderFactory to the machine.config 64bit. And my installer itself will register with the 32bit machine.config. I tried and it failed since I cannot have a 64bit assembly in a setup project that targets 32bit. However, I am going to try to build the console app using AnyCPU assuming it will run as a 64bit process on 64bit OSs.p  pThis is rather messy, but I emthinkem it will work. Why is this a bad idea And why does microsoft say To distribute a .NET Framework application both to 32 and 64bit platforms, build two MSI packages, one targeted at a 32bit and the other a 64bit computer a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibrarycd7a85k928vvs.8029.aspx relnofollowmsdna. Will it work since technically all of my assemblies are AnyCPUp  pAlso, Im using .NET 3.5p

Negative 2847 pSay I have a code.Rnwcode file containing the usual LaTex mixed in with R code chunks. Im especially interested in converting a code.Rnwcode slides document, but this question applies to any code.Rnwcode document. Now I want to convert this to a file which contains all of the R code, emplusem all of the text that would normally be generated by LaTex, as emR commentsem. In other words, the functionality I want is similar to what codeStanglecode does, but I also want all the text part of the LaTex converted to plain text thats commented out in the resulting .R file. p  pThis would be a very convenient way to automatically generate a commented R file thats easy to look at in your favorite syntaxhighlighting editor e.g. emacs. This might not sound like a great idea for an Sweave document thats a long article with only a bit of R code, but it starts to look appealing when the code.Rnwcode document is actually a slide presentation e.g. using codebeamercode  then the text portion of the slides would make perfect comments for the R code.  p  pAnyone have any ideas on how to do this Thanks in advance.p

Negative 2847 pI need to implement a GetOrCreate i call it ensureExists of an entity in a springjpa hibernate driven web application.br I have a layered application WSServicesDALDatastore and I want to implement this functionality in the service layer spring driven.br The basic idea isp  ol liFindentityli liIf found return it.li liOtherwise persist the entity.li liIf all ok return it.li liIf a unique constraint violation has occurred try to lookup the entity again and return it.  li ol  pThe problem arises from the fact that once an exception is thrown the hibernate session should be closed and reopened from Sessions a hrefhttpdocs.jboss.orghibernatecore3.5apiorghibernateSession.html relnofollowdocumentationa which makes step 5 invalid, but I still want to encapsulate this logic in the service layer and not have it reside in the DAL or WS.  p  pId love to hear suggestions on how this can be solved, I have an idea but Id like to hear some input before posting it as to not tilt the answers toward it.  p  pThanks in advancep  pstrongUpdatestrongbr The solution I have in mind is as followsbr Refactor stage 3 into a package scoped service which has a single ensureExists method with generics which accepts the Dao of that type and the entity and has the propogation of codeREQUIRESNEWcode.

Negative 2847 pI have a website that uses hashes for navigation, so it just uses javascriptajax to load new pages in. Of course the one file, index.php loads when you load the page, then everything else is controlled via javascript. Im now using an iFrame to upload photos, the problem is that it seems like when I click on links to go to other pages while the iframe upload the files, since it is on the index.php page so its not affected by switching pages it just waits and I think it waits until the file upload is complete to load the new page I have requested. I have seen websites that do this though, my initial thought is that it could just be this They use another server to store their files on, aside from the one the website is hosted on, therefore if its that reason it doesnt take all the bandwidth and resources from each other. would this be the casep

When Im doing it, I get a SafeArrayTypeMismatchException  not really surprising, looking at how the result is expected to be handled in the sample. So I was trying to use a custom marshaler. Since a cannot alter the component itself, I tried to introduce it this wayp  precode[Guid06F53853E43C4F309E5FD1B3668F0C3C] [TypeLibType4160] [ComImport] public interface IInterfaceNew  IInterfaceOrig       [DispId130]     int GetPrecursorInfoFromScanNumint nScanNumber, [MarshalAsUnmanagedType.CustomMarshaler, MarshalTypeRef  typeofMyMarshaler] ref object pvarPrecursorInfos, ref int pnArraySize  codepre  pThe TypeLibType and DispID attribute are the same as in the original version. This works as far as that the MyMarshaller.GetInstance method is called, but I do not get a callback in MyMarshaller.NativeToManaged. Instead, an access violation is reported. So is this a reliable approach If yes  how can I make it work If no are there any alternativesp  pJust a footnote in theory I could try to use managed C to call the component natively. However, there are lots of other methods in it that work fine with COM interop, so I would very much like to stick with C if there is any way.p

Negative 2847 pI am attempting to create an ASP.NET 4.0 website C that does the following after the user clicks a button, take user inputs from text boxes and call a Powershell script on the server.  The Powershell script output is logged to a textfile on the same machine.  The script executes some stored procedures on a SQL server.  Once the script is done executing, the page reads the contents of the log file and returns them in the page.  The reason I log this as I do is because I need to capture the verbose output of these operations.p  pThe problem I am having is that the whole set of commands that are run after the user clicks the button is queued if another user has the site open and is attempting the same operation.  I am not clear as to why this happens.  When run outside of the website, the Powershell scripts execute in parallel.  The log files that the application writes to use a timestamp and user inputted information to ensure that they are different depending on who is inputting the info.p  pHere is the code that is executed when the button is clickedp  precodeprotected void TestClickobject sender, EventArgs e              Get the current datetime to use a timestamp for the log file         DateTime curDate  DateTime.Now         string logFileName  Dtest1logs  curDate.Year  curDate.Month  curDate.Day              curDate.Hour  curDate.Minute  curDate.Second  curDate.Millisecond                TextBox1.Text.Replace,   Test.txt           Clean the Result TextBox         ResultBox.Text  string.Empty           Initialize PowerShell engine         var shell  PowerShell.Create           Add a script to the PowerShell shell object that will execute the instructions with the given input         shell.Commands.AddScriptpowershell.exe file Dtest1psscript0.ps1   TextBox3.Text                 TextBox1.Text     TextBox2.Text     TextBox4.Text   gt   logFileName           Execute the script         shell.Invoke           Create a StreamReader object to read the results of the script instructions and then store the files contents in a string         StreamReader sr  File.OpenTextlogFileName         String results  sr.ReadToEnd         results  results.ReplaceVERBOSE ,          sr.Close           Set the text of the result box to the string that was read in         ResultBox.Text  results      codepre  pI am hoping to find out if there is information I can read about allowing multiple users to click this button, and have the backend script run simultaneously for each of them.

Negative 2847 pI would like to know if it is possible to update a section of the view asynchronously without moving that section into a partial view, in ASP.NET MVC 3.0. In webforms model, I can have all the markup in just one page, but I can still update a section of the page by specifying the target div on the update panel without moving that section into separate user control. partial view is only useful if that HTML fragment is used in multiple views. creating a partial view just for the purpose of asynchronous update will result in HTML for the page scattered in multiple files.

Negative 2847 pIm currently trying to understand how Unity creates its builds because my teams is creating a texture heavy game and its crucial that we have enough memory for the game to function in the various environments specifically web and iOS. p  pTo test out the memory, I created a scene with a 166MB Resources folder and a cube. If you want to try it you can download it here a hrefhttpwww.mediafire.coma137tz6anatf6qi relnofollowhttpwww.mediafire.coma137tz6anatf6qia. The cubes for debugging purposes When the scene is just loaded, its green. It changes to blue and a second later starts to load all the textures in Resources. When it turns red it unloads all unused assets which is basically everything because I didnt assign the textures to anything.p  pNow Ive read about the disadvantages of Resources folder in various places, but my issue is with an empty scene and one game object, when the scene just starts, the process already takes up more than 600MB in the task manager After loading all Resources, it goes up to 1.3GB. Why What is the 600MB that is being loaded And how come the Resources folder bloats up by 6 times I read something about the compression actually increasing the file size of the images, is that truep

Negative 2847 pIm trying to implement pickingusing colors and readPixels in a WebGL program of mine. When I start my program I create to seperate shaderProgram. One for phong shading and another that simply give shapes a color to be use to detect which shape has been clicked on. p  pThe phong shader has 2 attributes. Vertex position and vertex normal. The picking one simply has the position. p  pNow I discovered that for some odd reason, when both of these shaders exist in the same program and Im using the picking one, my drawArray call seems to fail. The last thing to happen is my gl.vertexAttribPointer call. Ive been messing around and found out that when I check for active attrib arrays using  gl.getVertexAttribindex,gl.VERTEXATTRIBARRAYENABLEDp  pboth 0,1 return true this is when the picking shader is active with gl.useProgrampickingp  pNow if I disable 1 with gl.disableVertexAttribArray1 Everything works again. Another fix is to draw with the phong shader first and then use the picking shader and somehow that magically makes it ok. Im guessing that in that case when attaching my vertex normals buffer while using the phong shader, it somehow stays when I then switch to the picking shader and the drawArray call works. p  pId like to know if Im using gl.enableAttribArray wrong and should disable them when switching shaders or something like that.p  pIve also tried creating the shader programs in different order with no success. p

Negative 2847 pHow does IIS handles multiple simultaneous requests to a web service using the same session id when that web service relies on sessions  p  pIf the first web service call has not finished processing, does IIS queue the second web service call temporarily until the first web service call has finished since they both rely on the same session data.  p  pOr does IIS allow both requests to go forward and any changes made to the session store by the first request immediately affect the second web service call in process even thought that may cause unexpected results.  p  pI believe it is using the first option by queuing the second call until the first is completed due to session readerwriter locks but I have not been able to locate a definitive answer.p  pNote In this case the web service requests are generated from the client browser asynchronously.p

Negative 2847 pWe are faced with the task to convert a REST service based on custom code to Web API. The service has a substantial amount of requests and operates on data that could take some time to load, but once loaded it can be cached and used to serve all of the incoming requests. The previous version of the service would have one thread responsible for loading the data and getting it into the cache. To prevent the IIS from running out of worker threads clients would get a come back later response until the cache was ready.p  pMy understanding of Web API is that it has an asynchronous behavior built in by operating on tasks, and as a result the number of requests will not directly relate to the number of physical threads being held.p  pIn the new implementation of the service I am planning to let the requests wait until the cache is ready and then make a valid reply.

Of course, it would be better not to need to change the script at all but rather define these lists as external files or pass them to the script as arguments. I tried to generalise the solution by using those two codeforcode loops to assign the regions. I did fiddle around for a while trying to get a more Rcentric solution using codeapplycode functions but couldnt get it to work so I gave up and stuck with what I knew.p  pHowever, in my code as it stands the codescalefillmanualcode call needs to be explicitly passed variables to define fill colours, such as codeeurope  bluecode. These variables will vary depending on the data I am processing, so with the script in its current form, I will need to manually edit the ggplot part of the script for each group of data series. I know that would be be timeconsuming and I strongly suspect it would also be very prone to errors.p  pstrongQ. Ideally I would like to be able to programmatically extract and define the required values for the codescalefillmanualcode call from a previously declared list of values in this case from codelistofregionscode matched to a previously declared list of colours, but I cant think of a way to achieve this.

Negative 2847 pIm making an app in Adobe AIR targeting iOS 4.0 and Android 2.3.  Ive tried to disable iOS elastic scrolling for the embedded YT video  When the user presses the players IFrame the whole video pans over and I cant seem to find a way around this.  p  pIve tried adding event listeners to prevent this behavior but it doesnt work.  p  pBy the way, Im aware that I cant really control what happens in the IFrame.  A quick and dirty solution would be to put elements directly over the frame, like a transparent canvas or a div that would catch the events.  Not ideal at all, because users wont be able to press the buttons on the player.p  pAny ideas or suggestions  p  pThanksp

Negative 2847 pI apologize in advance for the lack of specificity in this post. I am trying to move a very large document to an intranet site online, and I am unsure of the best way to do this. The document is an administration plan with several chapters each with subcategories and a glossary at the end.p  pThe online representation should be clearly hierarchic e.g. each chapter its own category, each subcomponent of a chapter its own subcategory, easily searchable with advanced search options, and displayed with a treestructure menu. The FAQs module in DNN seems to get the job done, but I am curious as to whether once I stick all the information in that module, Ill be able to move it around if, say, I want the administration plan on another site. It also lacks a good search functionality. I am trying to do the same in Joomla with the Glossword extension, but I am having all sorts of problems getting it to work.p  pIn any case, my question isis there an easy way to implement this structure using DNN or Joomla, or are there better ways of putting a large, interrelated encyclopedia type document online And relatedly, are there ways to automatically push this document into such a structure without having to manually copy and paste the information into text boxes The document is demarcated well.p  pThank you, and I apologize again if I sound unclear. If anyone has any ideas, suggestions, or advice, please feel free to include it. Thanksp

Negative 2847 pSo I am having a small problem with creating notifications that open an activity from a service. I have narrowed the problem down to what appears to be a conflict between the ongoing pending intent and the notification pending intent. p  pSo let me describe what I am trying to do.p  pI have an application that has a background service polling for new data from a data server. The app continues to poll for data even when there is no activity in focus to allow the app to notify the user of specific events. similar to having a background service poll for new mail every 10 minutes.p  pI want the user to always be aware that the app is running as the polling does risk the users data plan if the app if forgotten about. For this reason I created an ongoing notification in the services onCreate function. When the user taps on the ongoing notification The service should either bring the main app activity to the front or create one. This is done using the following codep  precodeOverride public void onCreate      super.onCreate      the Data object is the actual polling object runnable     data  new Data      ui and data intents are used to send data from the service to the activities that need them     uiintent  new IntentBROADCASTACTION     dataintent  new IntentBROADCASTACTION      res  getResources       the intent to start the main activity     Intent notificationIntent  new Intentthis, Spectrum.class     notificationIntent.setFlagsIntent.FLAGACTIVITYCLEARTOP              Intent.FLAGACTIVITYSINGLETOP      PendingIntent contentIntent  PendingIntent.getActivitythis, 0,             notificationIntent, PendingIntent.FLAGONESHOT      Notification notification  new Notification             R.drawable.notificationicon, , System.currentTimeMillis     notification.setLatestEventInfothis, App Name, Open App,             contentIntent      notification.flags  Notification.FLAGNOCLEAR     startForegroundAPPNOTIFICATION, notification  codepre  pSo far this code works fine. If i press the home button and then tap on the ongoing notification it brings up the main activity Spectrum.classp  pNow on top of the ongoing notification I also want specific event notifications that occur from time to time. When a user taps on one of these notifications the app is to create a new spectrum layer and pass some information to that activity to display. again very similar to a mail app that starts the main program and highlights the new email.p  pTo create these notifications I use the following code         private void alertint alertid              String ns  Context.NOTIFICATIONSERVICE         String name  data.getData[alertid]p  precode    NotificationManager mNotificationManager  NotificationManager getSystemServicens      int icon  R.drawable.notificationicon     CharSequence tickerText  name   has an event     long when  System.currentTimeMillis      Notification notification  new Notificationicon, tickerText, when      Context context  getApplicationContext     CharSequence contentTitle  New Event     CharSequence contentText  name      Intent notificationIntent  new Intentthis, Spectrum.class      notificationIntent.putExtraSpectrum.CURRENTIDX, alertid      notification.flags  Notification.FLAGAUTOCANCEL     if PreferenceManager.getDefaultSharedPreferencesgetBaseContext             .getBooleanvibrate, false              notification.defaults  Notification.DEFAULTVIBRATE          if PreferenceManager.getDefaultSharedPreferencesgetBaseContext             .getBooleanchirp, false              notification.defaults  Notification.DEFAULTSOUND           PendingIntent contentIntent  PendingIntent.getActivitythis, alertid,             notificationIntent, PendingIntent.FLAGONESHOT      notification.setLatestEventInfocontext, contentTitle, contentText,             contentIntent      I want multiple alerts, up to 1 for every event id so simply set the      notification id to be the event id.     mNotificationManager.notifyalertid, notification  codepre  pAgain this code works fine. When the event occurs the notification is displayed. If the notification is tapped the spectrum activity is created and the intent extas are processed correctly. More specifically I have tested it with multiple events being created and tapping them in various orders and everything works perfectlyp  pThe problem comes when I press the home button, bring the app back to the front with the ongoing notification and then try to tap one of the event notifications. As soon as I have pressed the ongoing notification the event notifications stop working. They are still created and when I tap on them they are cleared but no new spectrum activity is created and the data being passed eventid is not processed. the previous activity stays the same.p  pDoes anyone know why the event notifications stop workingp  pOne thing I have noticed is that prior to tapping on the ongoing service notification when I tap on an event notification I get an Info message int he LogCat that looks likep  precode1004 113907.153 WActivityManager102 startActivity called from nonActivity context forcing Intent.FLAGACTIVITYNEWTASK for Intent  cmpandroid.package.test.Spectrum bnds[0,369][480,465] has extras  codepre  pbut after I have pressed the ongoing service notification i get the above line plus the following linep  precode1004 114244.953 WInputManagerService102 Window already focused, ignoring focus gain of com.android.internal.view.IInputMethodClientStubProxy4085c650 codepre  pEdit forgot to mention that I am coding on a windows machine using eclipse.

Negative 2847 pWhen writing functions in PHP how extensively should one check and validating the data in parametersp  pFor example if I expect a parameter to be a boolean, should I cast it as suchbr Or check that the parameter type is boolean and if not return FALSEp  pI dont particularly like the idea of returning FALSE from a function just because the parameters invalid, unless the function of the function urrg is to validate some data. Because it can mask the actual result of the function if it is designed to return TRUEFALSE anyway.p  pIf the function generates a PHP error resulting from invalid data being supplied then in a way thats more useful to the developer than just returning FALSE or returning an empty string. That way they know their input data and therefore possible usage of the function is invalidincorrect rather than the tests within the function just returning FALSE rather than TRUE.p  pI could always check the data coming in to the function and codetriggererrorcode if the data is invalid.

Negative 2847 pIm exploring a variety of options for a JavaScript routing framework that Im working on, and Id like to provide a DSL written in JavaScript for defining the router. p  pI had the idea of using temporary prototype overrides on the String class maintain a hash of the previous prototype values, override, run the DSL code, reset the prototype values to what they were to all for something like thisp  precodeDSL.runfunction    hello.isSomething   foo.isSomethingElse  codepre  pThe other idea was to use define temporary global variables and then removereset them after the DSL is done running. That way, if you run the DSL closure with codewindowcode or whatever the global object is as the codethiscode context, I believe you should be able to do something likep  precodeDSL.runfunction    defineSomethinghello   defineSomethingElsefoo  codepre  pI know I know I know I should be super careful about the prototype overloads and polluting the global namespace, but this seems to be a pretty localized and easily cleanupable approach to keep that sort of thing from happening. My question is, are there any other considerations that would keep this from being a realityp  pOne potential problem I could think of is whether this would work in a Node.js setting, where code is stored in separate modules and global variables kept from each other, which I think would eliminate option B, but what about String prototype overloads Those are shared between modules, right e.g. if I include module A, which sets String prototype values, those prototype values will be available in the including code, rightp  pAlso, let me know if anyones done this sort of thing before. I think its a clever approach to this sort of problem and I havent seen anything quite like it, but I want to make sure Im not leaving out something really obvious and damning.p

Is there a way I can randomize where the grasshoppers jump Additionally, is there any way I can make them continuously hop around everywherep  pThanks in advance.p

So far fine.p  pNow, there is a usecase where I need to write a message through a MessageToByteEncoder the same custom outboundhandler I talked about before from the main program in the end, this will actually be a library using Netty underneath.

This scenario does not seem to work in my case nothing seems to happen, as if my message was not sent. Unfortunately, there is not a lot of log statements in Netty and I may be wrong but the issue I have may surface because the main thread is not in the event loop no surprise here .p  pUnfortunately, the RXTX example only write messages from an inbound handler via the ChannelHandlerContext, so I cant find out what Im doing wrong or if there is a bug to this really recent addition in Netty.p  pAny suggestionsp

Negative 2847 pThis is a metaquestion. How does one, using the codeINFORMATIONSCHEMAcode provided with each database, discover the return values of a stored procedure With functions, the return value is explicitly declared and shows up in the codeINFORMATIONSCHEMAcode under codeROUTINEScode. p  pHowever, stored procedures seem to be a bizarre grey area as always is the distinction between SPs and functions. They seem to officially have no return value, but yet at the end you can run a SELECT statement such asp  precodeSELECT RowID  RowID codepre  pFor example and in C you read the return value from the column RowID. This makes it clear that stored procedures actually are capable of returning values, albeit not within the context of TSQL code like functions do.p  pHow does one discover these values and their types without having to parse the definition itselfp  pstrongEDITstrongp  pIf you are searching for this, the return values of stored procedures are integers implicitly, but also can return data called emresult setsem.p

Negative 2847 pMy ultimate goal right now is to have a link appear on top of video when the video has reached the end. Using the JW Players functionality I have determined how to have the link appear when the video is complete but only in standard view. If the user views the video in fullscreen the link does not appear. I have done extensive reading and understand that when it is in fullscreen mode the video is in flash and I cannot override the flash functions without integrating the link into the swf file, which I do not want to do.p  pWhat I have done is to remove the fullscreen button in the JW Player video player using a skin. Then I created a button to display the video in fullscreen using the HTML5 fullscreen functionality. I understand that IE will not work with this...that is fine for now. I am also able to create a fullscreen state change event listener so that my link will appear on top of the video. But it does not work.p  pNo matter how I style the DIV which holds the link it does not appear on top of the video.p  pCan someone point me in the right directionp  pThank you for any help that anyone can give me.p  pCode examplep  precodecontainer        positionrelative    zindex0   overlay     visibilityhidden     width 700px     height50px     colorFFF     position absolute     top 532px     margin8px     padding5px     backgroundcolor000       textaligncenter   overlayfullscreen    visibilityhidden    textaligncenter    colorFFF    fontsize26px    zindex 1000    position absolute              top 800px    margin8px     padding5px     overlayhidden               ltdiv idcontainergt     Loading the player, if not working please update your browser. ltdivgt                        ltbutton onClickgoFullscreencontainer return falsegtClick for Fullscreenltbuttongt      var path  ltphp echo videopath gt  jwplayercontainer.setup  autostart ltphp echo autostart gt,         file ltphp echo fullvideopath gt,                                  height ltphp echo height gt, width ltphp echo width gt, skin ltphp echo skin gt,  events      onComplete function          document.getElementByIdoverlay.style.visibility  visible                                                                                                                          document.addEventListenermozfullscreenchange, function                                       document.getElementByIdoverlayfullscreen.style.visibility  visible               , false codepre

Negative 2847 pIm currently working on making an XNA 2D platformer, and Im wondering if its possible to draw a kind of static GUI over the gamep  pWhat i mean here is that while the game updates and the players position changes etc, the GUI would be drawn on a kind of static layer overlay, that would be the size of the window the game is being run in. That way the game wouldnt have to constantly update the GUIs position and thus be a little bit nicer to handle. p  pAny ideasp  pThanks for your timep

Negative 2847 pIs it a reasonableresponsible idea to store a database result set in the users session, as opposed to loading it fresh from the database on every page load I am aware of the availability of caching the generated HTML code in a cache file on the server but that has too many convenience issues in my opinion.p  pFor example, on a shopping page, the brands tab in the main nav has a drop down menu that lists all the brands that currently have products on the site. The query is optimized but it would still have to run at every page load. Instead of doing that I would like to save the result set in the users session, thus only loading the brands once per session.p  pAlternatively, I could generate the HTML code for the subnav and store it in a cache file on the server. If the idea of storing the array in the session isnt beneficial to the servers performance, I might be able to see past the convenience issues.p  pThanks for all the helpp

I would expect p  precode[0,1,2]  codepre  pas output, but the actual result is p  precode[2,2,2] codepre  pI would expect the lambda definitions to bind a deep copy of the loop index, since it is just a number rather than a more complex structure, but clearly theres stuff going on here that I dont understand.p  pI have a feeling this may be a common gotcha for new Python programmers, but all the terms I can think of to describe the problem are so generic that my searches only return a deluge of unrelated answers.p  pCould you please explain to me what is happening here instead of what I expected, and preferably also what I should have done to create the desired effect of several different methods.p

Negative 2847 pAs the title indicates, Im trying to use codeos.walkcode inside a Tkinter mainloop. Im using Python 3.3.0.p  pEssentially, I have an interface that when you press a button, you then enter a strongforstrong loop that iterates the elements of a list for this case, they are archive names, that are later decompressed and afterwards calls the codeos.walkcode loop to perform some comparison options. This wouldnt be a problem if I hadnt anything to show on the main window. Since I expect this to take a while, I was planning to add a pair of time counters to record and estimate the time it takes to perform the full operation.p  pI know that if I enter a strongforstrong or strongwhilestrong loop inside a codemainloopcode I would end up starving the codemainloopcode, therefore the timers wouldnt be updated until the loop ended. I also know about codew.updateidletaskscode but that only seems to update the stuff inside the loop.p  pI know that the best way to loop while inside codemainloopcode is to have a function call itself recursively either through a callback mechanism or a return statement. However, since codeos.walkcode is a generator, I dont know how to convert it to a recursive function.p  pHere is a snippet of the simplified code in questionp  precodefor file in ziplist     try          some code in here          for dirpath, dirnames, filenames in os.walkzipdirpath             for files in filenames                 filepath  os.path.joindirpath,files[lenzipdirpath1]                 size  os.statos.path.joindirpath,files.stsize                 printfilepath                 left.appendfilepath         printsize           some code in here      except          some code in here      finally          some code in here codepre  pI can convert or at least I think I can the first loop to something like thisp  precodedef callback  to be called by Tkinter     def funcindex0         if index gt lenziplist             return           some code in here          index  1         funcindex codepre  pBut Im slightly baffled on how to do the same with the codeos.walkcode loop. Hence, my question.p  pEDIT I believe I may have found an answer. If I use codenextos.walk...code I can eventually get everything I would need as a tuple. However, I would still like to hear some other answers.p

Negative 2847 pWe are a small computer science laboratory.

Apart from that I could get the whole set of Revisions if I want, but its lazily initialized by default. To achieve this, it might be necessary to use a custom query to get the last revision done from the whole set.p  pI think that cant be achieved with formulas, because they just retrieve a value, not a whole Entity. I want to be able in some way to choose what the codemanytoonecode relation should have.p  pA solution could be a hrefhttpstackoverflow.coma71774161199132to use a viewa instead of the strongDetectablestrong table itself. That way I could have a strongVDetectablestrong entity which would be mapped against the view and the view could obtain all the original attributes plus the reference to the strongRevisionstrong Im interested in.p  pAnyway, is it possible to have it loaded using only the original entityp

Negative 2847 pSo today I was looking to zip a VS project up and send to a friend. I zipped it up, uploaded to Google Drive, and sent them a share. The trick is that I moved the entire project file out of VS rather than copying it.

I thought I could just move it back into the VS 2013 Projects folder, but I was wrong. Sorry for the silly beginner questionp

Negative 2847 pIm stuck on trying to use Mongoose for my simple Node.js app. I have created a couple custom objects in my object that basically implement a linked list data structure. Ive been able to save the objects successfully but the problem comes when I try to retrieve the object and call some of the methods that I have defined for it. I tried using Object.create as a workaround but that did not work. Here is where the code failsp  precodeUserObj.findOne  username  username  .exec functionerr, user      iferr          res.status404.json success false, message Database error          return          ifuser  null          res.status404.json success false, message Username not Registered          return          var sq  Object.createMusicQueue, user.songQueue  Not sure if im supposed to pass in MusicQueue or MusicQueue.prototype.

Negative 2847 pI am reasonably new to web development and I am just trying to expand my knowledge for a couple of sites Im working on to become more effective.p  pMy question is if I have a coderegister.phpcode page in my directory and I only want to make it accessible via the redirect back from an external PayPal checkout can this be donep  pI am obviously aware that I would usually use codeSESSIONcode to protect the content of a page, however I am wondering how I can use this before a user has registered. I am aware that I could use a PayPal API however I wondered whether there is a way of only displaying the register form from the redirect without a codeSESSIONcode in place as the user will not yet be registered. I would need to protect the coderegister.phpcode page as I would want to ensure a payment has been made first. I will probably look down the route of API at a later date, I just wanted to know if there is a way of displaying secure content to unregistered users.p

Negative 2847 pI have 100 points representing the boundary of a sphere of radius .1 and center .5,.5,.5. I would like to represent this sphere in an array of points on a 3D gird. The values of the array would be binary. 1 to represent inside the sphere and 0 to represent outside the sphere. The representation would be upon the unit cube.p  pI forsee the array looking something like this. For an array 100 by 100 by 100. The 1,1,1 value would be 0. The 50,50,50 value would be 1, since this grid point is inside the sphere.p  pHere is the code that creates and plots the 100 or more points.

Negative 2847 pHi Ive have a US based client with a Magento store integrated with Quickbooks through Webgility. They are having a tough time with EUR transactions, because while Magento shows the amount payed in USD and the equivalent payed in EUR, Quickbooks is showing only one amount, the EUR equivalent paid instead of the USD.p  pAn example the customer pays EUR70.87 for a USD100.00 product, and then Quickbooks shows the product as sold for USD70.87.p  pI found that in codesalesflatordercode, in the codegrandtotalcode,  codesubtotalcode, codetotalinvoicedcode and others, the amount recorded is 70.87, while in the ones starting with codebasecode it is stored 100.00.

Negative 2847 pI am trying to use the .NET Entity Framework in a WPF application. I have some model classes that, depending on various properties, should be visible or invisible in some lists. For a single property  for example, a codeboolcode property  I was able to use a Converter that turns the codeboolcode value into a codeVisibilitycode  fine so far.p  pThe next challenge is that I need to implement more complex operations to determine whether a model element should be visible. A typical example might look like thisp  precodepublic bool IsVisibleInProjectView      get  return IsDeleted ampamp IsSelectedForDisplay ampamp Milestones.Anyms gt ms.IsVisibleInProjectView   codepre  pI was able to add this method to the generated partial class and use a Binding to influence the visibility. However, this has one drawback Whenever one of the underlying properties is changed, whoever is listening to the derived property is not notified. I found several answers that suggested triggering the codeOnPropertyChangedcode event manually, but the generated EF classes are very lightweight and do not seem to implement the Interface codeINotifyPropertyChangedcode anymore It seems like Im missing something here  if the EF entities are not the ones issuing the notifications, who isp  pI have also tried to add a computed property to the model Im using the modelfirst approach, but basically came full circle and ran into the same issue How would I update the computed property whenever one of the base properties changesp

Negative 2847 pIm new to Delphi XE5 part of Embarcaderos RAD Studio, and using the StrToFloat function in a VCL Forms project designed to build a simple calculator.p  pThe code to display the text to the user works well, but Im having trouble extracting it in a way that will allow the calculator to actually perform calculations. The means Ive settled on is displaying the code to the user in a Tedit, and storing the code to be executed in a Tmemo.

Negative 2847 pI have an angularjs app that has several modules. The main modules looks something likep  precodevar app  angular.modulemainMod, [apiService] app.controllerMainCtrl, function Socket      scope.objects        do something with scope.objects, etc.  codepre  pAnd then I havep  precodevar apiService  angular.moduleapiService, [ngResource]  etc codepre  pandp  precodeapiService.factorySocket, [rootScope, function rootScope       create a websocket and listen for stuff      if something happens, update objects in rootScope ] codepre  pThe thing is, I see that the service codeSocketcode has been injected in codeMainCtrlcode, but inside the codeSocketcode service, I can not access coderootScope.objectscode. I do understand that factories have no scopes of their own, but since its injected into codeMainCtrlcode, shouldnt the rootscope refer to the scope of the codeMainCtrlcodep  pThere is a workaround using events, but Im not too keen on that. I have tried it with success but Id prefer a solution where this just works.p

This can be no good for cryptographic applications because it makes the execution time dependent on the blocks content and this could allow for timing attacks.

So it is free to transform codeCRYPTOmemcmpcode such that it return immediately once it find the first mismatching pair of bytes and the secure version of codememcmpcode is no longer secure.p  pHow can codememcmpcode be implemented such that the a standard compliant compiler will not transform it into version that helps timing attacksp

Negative 2847 pI am hosting a website on an Amazon EC2 instance using an Apache Webserver and using GoDaddy DNS service.p  pI have tried using GoDaddys masking feature to mask the long domain of the EC2 instance but it will not show the filenames after my masked domain. I would like to see the filenames after my domain after it is masked so I have decided to use a .htaccess file in Apache to mask the URL.p  pI would like to mask the ec2XXXXXXXXXXX.uswest2.compte.amazonaws.com piece of the url to mydomain.com and then have the file name following.p  pFor example, right now it looks something like thisp  pa hrefhttpec2XXXXXXXXXXX.uswest2.compute.amazonaws.comindex.php relnofollowhttpec2XXXXXXXXXXX.uswest2.compute.amazonaws.comindex.phpa a hrefhttpec2XXXXXXXXXXX.uswest2.compute.amazonaws.comsomefolderanotherfile.php relnofollowhttpec2XXXXXXXXXXX.uswest2.compute.amazonaws.comsomefolderanotherfile.phpap  pI would like to change to something like thisp  pa hrefhttpmydomain.comindex.php relnofollowhttpmydomain.comindex.phpa a hrefhttpmydomain.comsomefolderanotherfile.php relnofollowhttpmydomain.comsomefolderanotherfile.phpap  pI am looking for insight as to where the .htaccess file needs to go and what the rules need to be added to mask the EC2 name and follow it with the file name.p  pEDIT Adding the edit so that anyone with this problem may be able to see my problem, my mistake, and how to correct.p  pThe problem, as Sebastian pointed out, had nothing to do with .htaccess but needed an A Record. We set up forwarding and masking but didnt even know that there was such a thing as an A Record so once we typed in the name of the website, www.example.com, no matter where we traversed in the URL we only saw the www.example.com and didnt ever see the full path in the URL. p  pSolution Once you are logged into GoDaddy, click on Domains and Manage My Domains. Click on the domain to add the A Record to example.com. Click on DNS Zone File. IMPORTANT You must have an Elastic IP on your EC2 instance. Edit the default A Record. If you arent doing a subdomain Host   Points To XX.XXX.XXX.XX TTL Chose a ttl right for you and where you are in production.

Negative 2847 pI am trying to use some profiling tools on CUDA with so many different inputs to see the the differences among different inputs. For this purpose I wrote a python script to compile the code on CUDA, run the profiler with different inputs and write the results into a CSV file.

Here is a part of python script that I wrote p  precodeimport subprocess ,sys, string, os START TIME p  subprocess.Popen[CUDA PROFILER COMMAND], stdoutsubprocess.PIPE s, err  p.communicate END TIME codepre  pI want to measure START TIME and END TIME and kill this run if it takes more than 30 minutes. The script would run line by line and if the CUDA PROFILER command takes more than 30 minutes, it never gets to END TIME line and I cannot measure the elapsed time of the CUDA PROFILER command. Any suggestion would be so much appreciated. p

However I dont know if its possible to pass a more copmlex object like multiple shapes as the data parameter of the codeDoDragDropcode method.p  pThe other approach I tried is to call codeDoDragDropcode with an empty string that way nothing gets dropped onto the slide, and after codeDoDragDropcode returned I can add shapes to the slide using the codeGlobals.ThisAddIn.Application.ActiveWindow.View.Slide.AddShapecode method, however I couldnt find a way to get the current position of the mouse pointer.p  pSo is it somehow possible to call DoDragDrop and pass multiple shapes to it, or get the cursor position after DoDragDrop returnedp  pstrongUPDATEstrong I found a solution for PowerPoint 2013, it can be done with the new codeAfterDragDropOnSlidecode event its not trivial though, details here a hrefhttpsocial.msdn.microsoft.comForumsenUS724f1737afa5476287405b3745e06f8aafterdragdroponslideeventinppt2013forumisvvba relnofollowhttpsocial.msdn.microsoft.comForumsenUS724f1737afa5476287405b3745e06f8aafterdragdroponslideeventinppt2013forumisvvbaa.p  pSo the question is that is the same thing possible in PowerPoint 2010p

Negative 2847 pThis question may be a little obscure.  Note I am using pythons Pandas library to extract some text data from .csv files.  I know that Pandas wasnt built for text, but I find its far more intuitive than the codecsvcode lib.p  pHeres my problem.  p  pI have two files  files A amp B  each with three columns, which appear in the exact same order in the csv files themselves.  The columns are X, Y, amp Z.p  precodecolnames  [X, Y,Z] data  pandas.readcsvC...path...FileA.csv, namescolnames  colx  listdata.X coly  listdata.Y colz  listdata.Z codepre  pWhen I open and print the contents of codeFileBcode i.e., placing codeFileBcode in the codereadcsvcode line instead of codeFileAcode, columns codecolxcode amp codecolycode are reversed.  In other words, if I print each colx item for FileA, it shows the contents of colx, but when I print colx for FileB it shows the contents of coly.  p  pThe columns are inexplicably reversed, and this is stopping me from abstracting the problem Im trying to solve, since I have to change the scripts functionality depending on which file I open.  Does anyone know why X amp Y would be reversed in the different files  The csv files themselves have the exact same column order  codeX,Y,Zcode  so I believe the problem is in the Pandas library or my script.  Any help would be hugely appreciated.  Thanksp

Negative 2847 pcrop has parameters that are two Points in the Cloud. One of these two points is a bottom corner, and the other a diagonally across top corner of a rectangle. Crop will remove all points outside this rectangle from the Cloud much like you would crop an image. The crop method must deal with two input points on a horizontal or vertical line segment, in which case all points not on the line segment are removed, and it must deal with two equal Points p1 and p2, in which case all Points but p1 are removed from the Cloud.p  pFor example, if the two input Points are 0.0,0,0 and 1.0,1.0, all Points outside the square delimited by 0.0,0.0, 0.0,1.0, 1.0,1.0, and 0.0,1.0 are removed, but if the two input Points are 0.0,0,0 and 0.0,1.0, all Points outside the line segment delimited by 0.0,0.0, and 0.0,1.0 are removed.p  pIm having a hard time approaching this logically.

So my question is, what should my maximum connections to MySQL be  Should it be the max pool size times the number of clients 20  300  6000  Or should it be less  Will an error occur if c3p0 has say, 3 connections already and tries to obtain another and MySQL is at its maxp  pI do not think that all clients will need their maximum number all at the same time, but I do want to prevent any errors from happening if a fringe case occurs.p

Negative 2847 pI have 3 controllersp  pSearchViewControllerp  pCollectionViewControllerp  pMainViewControllerp  pstrongIn shortstrong p  pIn CollectionViewController I can access SearchViewController by tapping the magnify glass in the nav bar. I can then search for a specific item. Then select a result from the rows returned. Once I tap a row the SearchViewController is dismissed and a query is performed on the CollectionViewController.p  pHowever on MainViewController things dont work the same. Because when the SearchViewController is accessed from the MainViewController and dismissed its the MainViewController that appears because that is where the SearchViewController was initialized from so I have to do some extra work to get me to the CollectionViewController to perform the query. I performed in first paragraph.p  pThere is a protocoldelegate method I set in the MainViewController that notifies the CollectionViewController when the SearchViewController is dismissed that is causing the app to crash. I cant figure out why. Please read on to for a better explanation of what is going on.p  pstrongIn longstrongp  pCustomer types what they want to search for in the search box of the SearchViewController and when they tap the row in the associated tableView of results the SearchViewController is dismissed and its parent CollectionViewController is now on screen.

However I have another controller MainViewController. SearchViewController can be accessed from MainViewController but I cant dismiss and perform a query the way I did when I accessed SearchViewController from CollectionViewController because when the SearchViewController is dismissed MainViewController is present on screen because it was the controller I accessed the SearchViewController from.p  pWhat I decided to do was detect which controller initialised SearchViewController then use the same delegate method from above to notify that controller when the SearchViewController was dismissed.p  pstrongInside SearchViewControllerstrongp  precode voidtableViewUITableView tableView didSelectRowAtIndexPathNSIndexPath indexPath      UITableViewCell cell  [tableView cellForRowAtIndexPathindexPath]        If count of child view controllers is greater than 1 then we are not on main table view controller       if [[[self presentingViewController] childViewControllers] count] gt 1          [self dismissViewControllerAnimatedNO completion         [[self delegate] searchViewControllerDismissedself withTitleForObject[[cell textLabel] text]]     ]      else          [self dismissViewControllerAnimatedNO completion         [[self delegate] searchViewControllerDismissedself withTitleForObject[[cell textLabel] text]]         ]       codepre  pThis works fine.

Negative 2847 pI am implementing a turnbased multiplayer game with game center. The first view controller ViewController shows the menu and it is already possible to display the codeGKTurnBasedMatchmakerViewControllercode on button tap. After inviting a friend for the game, the codeGKTurnBasedMatchmakerViewControllercode disappears and game center starts the game. The problem is that the game does not really start because it belongs to another view controller codeSecondViewControllercode. I am not able to use segues because I do not know how to assign a segue identifier to the codeGKTurnBasedMatchmakerViewControllercode because it is not in Storyboard. I know that there has to be a possibility to realize it because many apps use this feature. The Apple Developer Documentation solves this problem using a custom segue, but how is this possible Any ideasp  pApple Developer Documentationp  pTypically, your game dismisses the matchmaker view controller and immediately starts its own user interface to allow the player to play a turn.

Negative 2847 pI want to create a tiered pay calculator utility.p  pIn my javascript file I dynamically add rows and fields to a table I created with the HTML from a list of names I have in a text input field. The rows consist of a name label column, a text input column to put theyre gross earnings in and a calculated pay output column.p  pI would like for it to update the calculated pay column automatically when I make a change in the text input in the gross earnings column. Although I can trace the element ids through to the calculatePay function I cant seem to use or set their properties.  I get the feeling they are not unique as well. Any ideasp  pBTW you have to click the update button right now to run the javascript.p  pEdit  made some changes per suggestion. Still cant seem to take variables passed to the calculatePay function and simply turn them around and spit them back out into the Pay column of my table.p  pEdit  SOLVED. The issue was closure, which I didnt understand at first but heres the skinny. To isolate the scope of the variables so they dont get rewrote every time the loop comes around they need to be declared inside a function that gets recreated with every loop iteration because javascript scopes to the function instead of to the code block. Things to note  this does not work if you just declare a nameless function in the middle of your loop. You must return it to a variablei.e. var buildElement  functionYada Yada. Also, after the function add  to execute it.p  h2Javascripth2  precodefunction buildTable   var artists  document.getElementByIdartlist.value   var names  artists.split,   var len  names.length   var ptable  document.getElementByIdpayTable   var rowLength  ptable.rows.length   for i0  i lt len i    var buildElement  function      var row  ptable.insertRowrowLength      var nameCell  row.insertCell0      var grossCell  row.insertCell1      var payCell  row.insertCell2      var grossText  document.createElementinput      grossText.type  type      grossText.name  gtext[]      grossText.id  gross  names[i]      payCell.id  pay  names[i]      grossText.onchange  functioncalculatePaypayCell.id, grossText.id      grossCell.appendChildgrossText      nameCell.innerHTML  names[i]          function resetTable      var ptable  document.getElementByIdpayTable      var rowLength  ptable.rows.length      if rowLengthgt2       for prowLength pgt2 p       ptable.deleteRow2     buildTable      function calculatePaytarget, gross  document.getElementByIdtarget.innerHTML  document.getElementByIdgross.value          codepre  h2HTMLh2  precode  ltDOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC W3CDTD HTML 4.01 TransitionalEN         httpwww.w3.orgTRhtml4loose.dtdgt lthtmlgt   ltheadgt     lttitlegtlttitlegt     ltscript src.jsscript.jsgtltscriptgt     ltlink relstylesheet href.cssstyle.css gt   ltheadgt   ltbodygt     ltdivgt       lttable idpayTablegt         lttrgt         ltth colspan3 classhdrgt         Calculator         ltthgt         lttrgt         lttrgt         ltth classhdrgt         Name         ltthgt         ltth classhdrgt         Gross         ltthgt         ltth classhdrgt         Pay         ltthgt         lttrgt       lttablegt     ltdivgt      ltdivgt       lttablegt         lttrgt         ltth colspan3 classhdrgt         SETTINGS         ltthgt         lttrgt         lttrgt         ltth colspan3 classhdrgt         Breakpoints         ltthgt         lttrgt         lttrgt         lttdgtBreak 1 at          ltinput typetext namebreak1   idbreak1 value300gt         lttdgt         lttdgt         lttdgt         lttdgtBreak 2 at          ltinput typetext namebreak2 idbreak2 value900gt         lttdgt         lttrgt         lttrgt         ltth colspan3 classhdrgt         Percentage levels         ltthgt         lttrgt         lttrgt         lttdgt         Below break 1         ltinput typetext size4 nameper1 idper1 value50gt         lttdgt         lttdgt         Between breaks 1 and 2         ltinput typetext size4 nameper2 idper2 value60gt         lttdgt         lttdgt         Over break 2         ltinput typetext size4 nameper3 idper3 value70gt         lttdgt         lttrgt         lttrgt         lttdgt         Artists         ltinput typetext nameartlist idartlist valueBrian,Eric,Christie,Cynthia,Shawngt         lttdgt         lttdgt         lttdgt         lttd classhdrgt         ltbutton onclickresetTablegtUpdateltbuttongt         lttdgt       lttrgt      ltdivgt   ltbodygt lthtmlgt codepre

Negative 2847 pI am trying to rotate a model in 3D so that it faces the right direction. The rotation I want is fairly trivial and can be broken down into two stepsp  ol liRotate the model 90 degrees on its xaxis.li liRotate the model 180 degrees on its zaxis relative to the first rotation.li ol  pThe way to set a models rotation in the framework Im using openFrameworks is by calling its setRotation method. This method takes an angle, as well as floats x, y and z that specify the axis of rotation. How do I calculate the axis of rotation and angle for this particular rotation I cant rotate the model two times sequentially because any call to setRotation overwrites previous rotations.p  pPlease let me know if I can provide more information or clarity.p  pEDIT In case anyone has the same question, this post a hrefhttpvoidinit.blogspot.com201201quaternionsandopenframeworks.html relnofollowhelped me a lota.p

Negative 2847 pAfter lookin for it around the day cant seem to find the right answer to my problem. p  pSituation Starting on L4 and planned to make an mediumlarge application, the framework consists an iOs app later on there will be an android, maybe an windows that interacts with an REST API build in L4 and an web application also in l4. p  pThe iOsandroid app will be able to have login functionality and can change certain stuff in the database via the API. The web application can be logged into and can also change stuff in the database.p  pnow my question the communication between the api and iOsAndroid app has to be secure because of the sending of personal information like password, username, emailadress, names etc... How can i secure this I heard about Oauth1.0a and 2.0 but since im not an extremely large project it seems to be an overkill, a lot of work and unnecessary.

Negative 2847 pIm trying to make an opposing stacked bar chart and have found codepyramid.plotcode from the codeplotrixcode package seems to do the job. I appreciate codeggplot2code will be the goto solution for some of you, but Im hoping to stick with codebasecode graphics on this one. p  pUnfortunately it seems to do an odd thing with the x axis, when I try to set the limits to non integer values. If I let it define the limits automatically, they are integers and in my case that just leaves too much white space. But defining them as codexlimc1.5,1.5code produces the odd result below.p  pIf I understand correctly from the documentation, there is no way to pass on additional graphical parameters to e.g. suppress the axis and add it on later, or let alone define the tick points etc. Is there a way to make it more flexiblep  pHere is a minimal working example used to produce the plot below. p  precoderequireplotrix set.seed42 pyramid.plotcbindrunif7,0,1,                    rep0,7,                    rep0,7,              cbindrep0,7,                    runif7,0,1,                    runif7,0,1,              top.labelsNULL,               gap0,              labelsrep,7,              xlimc1.5,1.5 codepre  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comIYvHT.jpg altenter image description herep  pJust in case it is of interest to anyone else, Im not doing a population pyramid, but rather attempting a stacked bar chart with some of the values negative.

Totals of each entire row.li ol  pOnce this is done, I descend through the mipmap levels beginning with smallest, adding the accumulated sum of the previous level adjusting for size and offset by 1 to the sum of the previous texels in the same row segment, and placing in a new texture.p  precodelevelNaccum[awidthb,y]    levelN1accum[a1,y]        sumfirst b pixels starting from levelNsum[awidth,y] codepre  pFor examplep  ol liAccum2. [4x64]  Sum2  Sum3li liAccum1. [16x64]  Sum1  Accum2li liResult Accum0.

Negative 2847 pIm not sure if Im just not seeing a blatant answer of if Ive been wrong about an important part of this programming language this whole time.p  pIn short, Ive got code that contains an array of doubles called buckets. My code needs to parse this array indexbyindex, check its value, and store in a new array called finalVals the last 5 values. The buckets array will contain about 100 values, most of which are zeros and are not needed. A sequence of 5 consecutive zeros will imply the end of the data that I need. So I need to return the last 5 values in buckets where the values are all nonzeros. This is stored in the array called nonZeros.p  precodelastVal  new double[5]  A global variable already declared but not set double nonZeros[]  new double[5]  A local variable int numberOfZeros  0 for int i  0 i lt buckets.length i      double val  buckets[i]     if val  0          System.out.printlnEncountered a zero.         numberOfZeros         lastVal[0]  lastVal[1]         lastVal[1]  lastVal[2]         lastVal[2]  lastVal[3]         lastVal[3]  lastVal[4]         lastVal[4]  val          else if val  0          System.out.printlnDid not encounter a zero.         numberOfZeros  0         lastVal[0]  lastVal[1]         lastVal[1]  lastVal[2]         lastVal[2]  lastVal[3]         lastVal[3]  lastVal[4]         lastVal[4]  val         nonZeros  lastVal  This is where the problem was          prettyPrintArrayslastVal,nonZeros     if numberOfZeros  5  break   return nonZeros codepre  pThe problem was in the last set. The if conditions do indeed properly detect whether or not val was 0 or really 0.0. And keeping the last 5 values in lastVal works. However, when that nonworking line is executed, the code behaves as if nonZeros became a pointer that simply pointed to lastVal. The nonZeros array ALWAYS stored the same values as lastVal from there on out, even when zeros were encountered in val. It was my understanding that these variables are independent. So I was expecting nonZeros to only hold the same values as lastVal in cases when we encountered a nonzero. And the function would always just return the last 5 values of buckets before 5 consecutive zeros were encountered.p  pThe solution was to replace that problematic line with code that sets the contents of nonZeros individually just as I did for lastVal. So am I missing something obvious in my code here that is always setting nonZeros to lastVal Or am I misunderstanding what nonZeros  lastVal actually doesp

Negative 2847 pBefore I explain the issue, Id like to say I can code in HTML and CSS, so if you could offer a solution using those Id be very pleased as Ill be fully able to customize it. Dont be afraid to use other languages though... Everything is welcome.p  pIve been searching around and I find a lot of similar questions with their respecive answers, but none quite matches what I need, so here I go.p  pIm building a website for a person who sells handmade stuff. So far, the idea is to show a simple gallery of all the items in stock, but since this stock is constantly changing, I need a way to reflect these changes on the site, easily. Furthermore, itd be even nicer if the seller himself could update the gallery without having to mess with the code on the actual site. Therefore, I plan to add a simple  tag in the main page, to be replaced with the data as written by the seller, but displayed in a specific format Ill probably have to write in a separate file... This is where my problems begin.p  pSo, the site has a images folder where a single picture for each of the items is stored, and the file the seller is supposed to modify should include the items name, filename of its picture, dimensions, price, a short description, and maybe the amount in stock. For each item. I dont even know what file format to use, since Im not experienced with databases at all.p  pI need this data to be displayed in a particular preset way, with all the items clearly visible at once using the browsers scrollbar, and without the need to edit any line of code anytime the amount of items varies as I cant just be watching the site at all times. I dont know how to do that, so any ideas would be much appreciated. Thanksp  pEdit Heres a sample of a little placeholder code I made just to see how things could fit, in case it can be used.p  precodelttd classthumbgtltimg srcimagestarjetas2011T01.JPGgtltbrgtltbgt2500  Cd.

Negative 2847 pIm using blueimps fileupload javascript  widget and jQuery 1.9.0 for uploading files to a server and I have an event not being triggered in IE8, which is one of the required browsers for my project.p  pSo because of this I can never open the window for browsing for the files. If I do a fileupload.click from the IE8 console, it works, but I didnt success in the code.p  pI think this is happening because of the bubbling of the event, but Im showing you the code for deciding for yourselves. I think also that styles are importante to this issue because maybe the styled button Im using over the real fileupload widget must be overlapping it.

Negative 2847 pso in order to restrict my apps user sql login I turned off create, drop, index, alter, tmp and lock. So, one of my tables will have rows deleted by the users, hence the index will most likely have a bunch of gaps, some being very large. I would just make the user reindex the table after a delete, but that would require me to enable drop andor alter, which for security reasons I do not want to enable.p  pSo now the user wants to access the index number 50 from this table but theres a gap from 4854 for instance.

Negative 2847 pIm trying to create a sort of entitycomponent system where the only thing identifying an entity is an index to vectors of components.p  pThis is supposed to be an implementation of sorts of the so called Entity Component System. It is for a game Im developing.p  pThere is, for example, a vector of sprite components and a vector of health components and the same index on both of them is a part of the same entity. I.e. spriteComponents[0] is part of the same entity as healthComponents[0].p  pThe problem I have is that not all entities will have all types of components. This means that Ill have to push some sort of emptynull on the vectors whose component type the entity does not have to retain the integrity of the index  entity id system.p  pI.e. entity 1 index 1 does not have a spriteComponent so spriteComponents[1] should be some sort of emptynull. br br For examplep  pWith empty objectsnull pointersbr ComponentType1 [x][x][x]br ComponentType2 [x][0][x]p  pWithoutbr ComponentType1 [x][x][x]br ComponentType2 [x][x]p  pWithout them the indexes will not work correctly.p  pNow I had two options in mind and both should work but Im wondering which is the better wayp  precodeOption 1 stdvectorltSpriteComponentgt spriteComponents  Add empty object to retain index  entity system when entity does not have a particular component  spriteComponents.pushbackSpriteComponent  Option 2 stdvectorltstdsharedptrltSpriteComponentgtgt spriteComponents  Add nullptr to retain index  entity system when entity does not have a particular component  spriteComponents.pushbacknullptr codepre  pAs I understand it, option 1 would have the advantage of the objects being contiguous in memory but using empty objects seems suboptimal. Is this still preferable to using pointers where I can simply use nullptrNULLp  pOf course if there is a better alternative Im open to suggestions.p  pEDITbr I was planning on entities not being actual objects, i.e. an entity is simply an index to the vectors. This is so that later on systems such as drawing can simply iterate through the vector containing the sprite components without caring whose sprites they are.p  pThis should then be rather efficient as they are right next to each other in memory whereas in a system where Entity would be a class containing spriteComponent and healthComponent etc. The iteration would be drastically less efficient or so I understand. as the similar components could possibly be nowhere near each other in memory.p  pActually having the entities exist as an object containing only the necessary indexes could be a workable solution. Then I could also have them contain a single number that tells what components it actually has and doesnt have.p  pComponents will not be shared between entities.p  phealthComponent is just an example of a component but it would contain information about the health of the entity and information affecting health healthpoints, armorclass etc. I am considering having them simply be structs components.p  pThank you.p

After testing on multiple platforms and browsers, Ive found very few issues bar one glaring one.p  pOn standard browsers, mobiles and other platforms, zooming in on the page scales the text appropriately away from the Vertical Div, allowing for my text to be viewed without any problems. Users can scroll to see the rest of the content, and no overlapping occurs.p  pHowever, on iPhones, it seems that the content shifts when zooming in, as if not registering that there is a padding from the left of the screen to keep the text where it should be. So, when zoomed out, everything is fine.p  pa hrefhttpi.imgur.comGLZ8nhC.png relnofollowhttpi.imgur.comGLZ8nhC.pngap  pAnd then, when you zoom in.. p  pa hrefhttpi.imgur.comUYKhVHP.png relnofollowhttpi.imgur.comUYKhVHP.pngap  pOverlapping occurs, making viewing of the text difficult. I understand that there are problems with positionfixed within iOS, particularly iPhones, but any solutions Ive found are to fix errors such as juttering or moving Divs. Im genuinely stuck as to how to fix this, so any help would be fantastic.p  pThe coding for the Divp  pHTMLp  precode   ltdiv id headergt    ltdiv id titlegt            Social Hub    ltdivgt     ltdiv id logogt            ltimg classlogo srclogo.pnggt    ltdivgt    ltdiv id navbargt    ltdiv id currentpagegt           Poli Lissy Drax.            ltpgt Gender Male ltpgt           ltpgt Age 20 years old ltpgt           ltpgt Fur Species BadgerDragon Hybrid ltpgt           ltpgt Likes Fighting games, dragons, knives and website coding. ltpgt           ltpgt Hates Eating pizza with a fork.ltpgt    ltdivgt    ltdivgt codepre  pCSSp  precode   header     width 300px    height 100     position fixed    margin 0     fontsize 30px    backgroundcolor rgba0,0,0,0.7    overflowy auto    overflowx hidden    webkitoverflowscrolling touch         content      width 60    height 576px      marginleft 330px      paddingtop 20px     paddingleft 5px     paddingright 30px     textalign center     fontsize 16px     codepre

However, this is complicated by two challengesp  ol liThe codetargetdatecode is not fixed, but varies for each codesiteidcodeli liId like multiple date ranges to be output in the same table so I cant do a simple codeWHEREcode to exclude records falling outside the range from the codeeventcode table.li ol  pOne workaround Ive thought of is to simply make several queries, one for each date range, and then use a view to paste them together.

Negative 2847 pI am developing a larger application that communicates with GDB through a PHP script. I just discovered a problem. In my application, a user clicks a button, executing a JSON array to be sent to a PHP script. In the PHP script, it runs procopen on GDB and uses fwrite and fgets to communicate with GDB. This has worked fine when I just run my script with php from the command line, but when I tried my application with the button press, activating the JSON array to be sent to the PHP script, I got errors. Namely, my input was full of null values.p  pInvestigating this further, there seems to be an issue with communicating with GDB when run with JSON.

Negative 2847 pOk this is probably a silly question and maybe I am missing something.  I am not new to Java but I am hardly an expert.  Long story short, I wrote a air compressed rocket trajectory simulation no it wasnt homework.  It was my hey I want to learn Java so let me try this program.  It graphically simulates distance, max height, etc.  Now I am trying to add a second panel JFrame to show rocket stability in fight.  p  pI have a JPanel within a JFrame.  Within that I have DrawPanel class that does the drawing.  I am trying to draw a rocket.  So I need a rectangular body, fins, nose cone, etc.  Now I have written a method for drawing the body using a Rectangle2D object, and a method for drawing 2 fins using a Path2D object.  Now when I have both in my paint method, it only draws whichever is first.  I have flipped them and it will only draw whatever is first.  Now is there something with graphics2D objects that they have whitespace take up the whole panel, or am I completely missing something.  p  pI wrote a test program in the same design pattern as my main program in order to better try to fix this without launching the main.

Negative 2847 pWe have a java application that reads a chunk of data but keeps that data only for a short period of time. The data is stored in simple collections codeHashMapcode, codeHashSetcode. These collections are cleared when the data is processed so I call codecoll.clearcode and not codecollnullcode. The cycle readprocessclear continues, until all chunks of data are processed. After a certain amount of time, there will be new chunks and the whole thing starts again.p  pThis process has run for several weeks on a server without any problem.  However, today, after a planned restart, it crashed over and over and again with an codeOutOfMemoryError Java heap spacecode and restarted automatically by a monitoring process.p  pI connected to the process with a remote debugger AND with the emjvisualvmem tool to try and find if and where I could have a memory leak. While the processingthread was paused by the debugger right after the calls to codeclearcode, I forced a codegccode with the jvisualvm tool. As I had expected, it cleared almost the entire heap only 4MB used. Next cycles same behavour, almost no usage of the heap after codeclearcode, etc...

Negative 2847 pIs there a way in NancyFx to create a singleton that is only available within the request scope in which it has been created.p  pI am not thinking about a singleton created in the IOC container.

Negative 2847 pI have an MFC application that generates some reports and shows the same in the GUI.

Negative 2847 pIm trying to use ansible for a parameterised docker deployment. I want to be able to specify image, version and various different environment variables via the command line.p  pImage, Version and so on can be specified directly but the env parameter of the docker module requires a dictionary. Here is a shortened playbook examplep  precodename some deployment docker    [..]    name myname    [..]    env       FOO bar       ANOTHERFOO anotherbar codepre  pThe environment variables are choosen during runtime, so it is not possible to define them directly in the supplied extra vars. The playbook looks like this at the momentp  precodename some deployment docker    [..]    name  name     [..]    env  env  codepre  pSince env is a nested dictionary we need to supply the extravars as nested json. I would expected the following to workp  precode.ansibleplaybook [..] extravars namemyname, envFOObar, ANOTHERFOOanotherbar [..] codepre  pAfter the container is running, the values of env are not there. Supplying the json directly in the playbook for testing purposes works.p  pI tried the following different json with no working resultsp  precodenamemyname, envFOObar, ANOTHERFOOanotherbar  namemyname, env[FOObar, ANOTHERFOOanotherbar] codepre  pHow do you supply and use a nested dictionary via command line or is this a limitation of the Jinja2 template engine.p

Negative 2847 pI am building an Android application, using the Xamarin framework, that displays profile photos for users. The photos may either be drawn within an oval, like youd see on any social network, or in a rectangle based on what screen the user is on. The images I am drawing are downloaded from a web service and may be any size. Thus I must scale the photos, fix any rotation issues, and then draw them either in a rectangle or an oval.p  pThe entire process I have works fine, but the problem I have is when I load several of the profile views into a grid view, then the performance of the scroll event becomes very choppy and slow. I also get warnings in the console saying that 30 frames have been skipped, and that I may be doing to much on the main thread.p  pTo try and fix the issue Ive pushed the loading of the images to a background task, and that is also working great. However, the actual onDraw event is drawn on the main thread as its drawn by the OS.p  pIve tracked down the issue to the canvas.drawBitmap function call. When I comment out this command then the slow scrolling issues goes away, and I no longer get the warnings in the logs. This tells me that my process is efficient enough without the draw command, but when I add the draw command I start to get performance issues.p  pDoes anyone know how I can optimize the drawing process so that I can achieve smooth scrolling My code is below.p  pThis is my grid view adapter class that loads the profile photo views...p  precodenamespace AndroidApp      public class

Negative 2847 precently I have read quiet a few posts about how to detect touch devices and there is this if ontouchstart in window method. This one doesnt work to well though, because it will be a problem if the user has a mouse aswell as a touchpad. The reasion why Im asking this, is that I do have some issues with Onmouseover and Ontouchstart interfering with each other.p  pIf someone is touching the screen I only want the ontouchstart event to be triggered but browsers thinks they are smart and convert the onmouseover event into an onclick event, which is triggered aswell.p  pSo I was wondering, if its possible to tell the browser maybe through a meta tag to only do what he is told and dont trigger any click events if the user is just touching the screen.p

Negative 2847 pMeteorJS absolute noob here, so be gentle... p  pI am trying to build a one page web app, and I am using the a hrefhttpsatmospherejs.comironrouter relnofollowironroutera.p  pThe idea is that there are a few divs in the page, lets say 3, one for the menu, one which never changes and one where the content should change based on the menu selection.p  pIn a regular page I would just load the content in that one div.

Negative 2847 pOur company is planning to start a large new WinForm project, it will be written in c4.0 using Visual Studio 2010.p  pThis project will have many modules Production, Accounting, Service and etc... and each module with have lots of possible forms. So we are testing the idea of create multiple projects inside a single solution and have each module be its own project rather then having a single very large project.p  pI created a test solution with two projects strongAstrong and strongBstrong, next I added each project as a reference to the other project, when adding one project as a reference to the other, I right clicked on emReferenceememAdd ReferenceemBrowsed to the other projects embinDebugem folder and added the other projects em.exeem as the reference. Next, using the other project as a namespace I was able to do things like form inheritance and opening forms or calling methods between my two test projects.p  pBut I accidently clicked emClean Solutionem which cleaned the binDebug folder for my two projects, and all of my references between the two projects were broken.p  pWhat is a proper and reliable way to add permanently references between projects inside a single solution I was thinking I could physically copy each projects .exe into the other projects bin, then add it as a reference. But that means Ill have to manually recopy it every time the other project gets updated.p
