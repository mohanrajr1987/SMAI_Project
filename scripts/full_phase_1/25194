I would like to create a list element in the login process that steers the login to the relative email account server. Someone would go to siteA.com enter their email, password, and choose from a dropdown list, and hit login. the dropdown list choice would direct the login to the appropriate server needed for the email account. I understand that the incorrect dropdown list choice for an email would result in errors  and it should. the person logging in would have to know which server corresponded to their account. I need direction on how to incorporate that dropdown and supporting resources into the login page of roundcube.p

Positive 25194 pIm working on the navigation bar for a website and currently the main menu is complete. However, the Services and Products buttons need to each have their own submenu. The submenu should normally be hidden from view and appears when the user mouseovers on the respective button.p  pHere is a a hrefhttpjsfiddle.netjnLpmxam relnofollowstrongfiddlestronga with the desired result. Obviously, Id rather not use any javascript if possible.p  pThe idea I had initially was to have submenu have codeposition absolutecode with a codezindexcode value lower than that of the mainmenu, so that it can slide underneath the mainmenu. However, doing so messes up with the width if I give it codewidth 100code and since my site is responsive, I avoid static widths.p  pI also tried doing with relative positioning, but that doesnt work either.p  pAnother thing I dont like with that approach is that the markup for the main menu and submenu get split.

Negative 25194 pWhat is the easiest way to compare strings in Python, ignoring casep  pOf course one can do str1.lower lt str2.lower, etc., but this created two additional temporary strings with the obvious allocgc overheads.p  pI guess Im looking for an equivalent to Cs stricmp.p  p[Some more context requested, so Ill demonstrate with a trivial example]p  pSuppose you want to sort a looong list of strings. You simply do theList.sort. This is On  logn string comparisons and no memory management since all strings and list elements are some sort of smart pointers. You are happy.p  pNow, you want to do the same, but ignore the case lets simplify and say all strings are ascii, so locale issues can be ignored. You can do theList.sortkeylambda s s.lower, but then you cause two new  allocations per comparison, plus burden the garbagecollector with the duplicated lowered strings.  Each such memorymanagement noise is ordersofmagnitude slower than simple string comparison.p  pNow, with an inplace stricmplike function, you do theList.sortcmpstricmp and it is as fast and as memoryfriendly as theList.sort. You are happy again.p  pThe problem is any Pythonbased caseinsensitive comparison involves implicit string  duplications, so I was expecting to find a Cbased comparisons maybe in module string.p  pCould not find anything like that, hence the question here. Hope this clarifies the question.p

Negative 25194 pIs it better in some sense to vectorize code by hand, using explicit pragmas or to rely on or use autovectorization  For optimum performance using autovectorization, one would have to monitor the compiler output to ensure that loops are being vectorized or modify them until they are vectorizable.  p  pWith hand coding, one is certain that the desired instructions are being emitted, but now the code is likely not portable either to other architectures or other compilers.p

Negative 25194 pI have a program that amongst other things has a command line interface that lets the user enter strings, which will then be sent over the network. The problem is that Im not sure how to connect the events, which are generated deep inside the GUI, to the network interface. Suppose for instance that my GUI class hierarchy looks like thisp  pGUI  MainWindow  CommandLineInterface  EntryFieldp  pEach GUI object holds some other GUI objects and everything is private. Now the entryField object generates an eventsignal that a message has been entered. At the moment Im passing the signal up the class hierarchy so the CLI class would look something like thisp  precodepublic     sigcsignalltvoid, stringgt msgEntered codepre  pAnd in the ctorp  precodeentryField.msgEntered.connectsigcmemfunthis, ampCLIpassUp codepre  pThe passUp function just emits the signal again for the owning class MainWindow to connect to until I can finally do this in the main loopp  precodegui.msgEntered.connectsigcmemfunnetworkInterface, ampNetworkInterfacesendMSG codepre  pNow this seems like a real bad solution. Every time I add something to the GUI I have to wire it up all through the class hierarchy. I do see several ways around this. I could make all objects public, which would allow me to just do this in the main loopp  precodegui.mainWindow.cli.entryField.msgEntered.connectsigcmemfunnetworkInterface, ampNetworkInterfacesendMSG codepre  pBut that would go against the idea of encapsulation. I could also pass a reference to the network interface all over the GUI, but I would like to keep the GUI code as seperate as possible. p  pIt feels like Im missing something essential here. Is there a clean way to do thisp  pstrongNotestrong Im using GTKgtkmmLibSigC, but Im not tagging it as such because Ive had pretty much the same problem with Qt. Its really a general question.p

Negative 25194 pIn standard use of asymmetrical cryptographic system, encryption is done with public key, decryption with private key.p  pInversing the process, encryption with private key is called signing.p  pStandard tools, despite terminology and lack of direct tools, allows to implement encryption system that would use the private key for encryption.p  pCould anyone explain clearly why such solution is vulnerablep  pbUser Casebp  pConsider that Alice wants to send to Bob some stuff in a nontraditional wayp  pAlice and Bob once met and Alice gave Bob a public key generated from a private key she created BUT she warned Bob to keep it secret. AND she kept secret the private key, and didnt ever give to anyone else the public key.p  pCould Bob be sure that messages he receives from Alice provided these are encrypted by Alice private key are only readable by him provided he really kept his copy of Alices public key secretp  pAnd how compares this encryption solidity to the traditional way, which would, in our case, be Bob sending messages encrypted by the public key of Alice to Alice p  pbWhat the question is aboutbp  pThe fact that asymmetrical keys are named private and public doesnt help understanding my question. Keys have underlying properties, and its me broadcasting the public key that gives it its public property. Please make this distinction clear before answering Im not considering the public and private properties of these keys but the solidity of the private key encryption versus public key encryption.p  pI cannot use another terminology even if it is misleading in this special case.p  pI know that this case is nontraditional, and could lead to several inconsistency, or is not the point of the asymmetrical crypto systems as Bob and Alice here share some sort of a common secret and thats not the point of asymmetrical crypto.p  pI saw several Stackoverflow answers which suggest that private key and public key are exchangeable just read below answers. This is not true for RSA as it is trivial to generate the public key from the secret key and this is guaranteed not to be computationally feasible in the other way round. For nonbelievers, the process of key generation in openssl with RSA isp  ol ligenerate a secret keyli liextract the public key from the secret key.li ol  pIf there are so big differences between private key and public key, is there a solidity difference between private key encryption versus traditional public key encryptionp  pbShort answer from long selected answerbp  pMisunderstanding on what exactly is the private key wasnt helping me. Theres two different definition of private key. The practical private key, and the theoretical private key.p  pemTheoretical private keyem from RSA theory shares mathematical symmetricity with public key p  ul   liYou cannot deduce one from the otherli   liEncryption is equally solid in either wayli ul  pemPractical private keyem from RSA tools like openssl contains additional information for efficiency reason, and often, a part of the public key is even set by convention.

Negative 25194 pThe docs for pipelined functions say that DML is not allowed when they are used in a SQL statement typically a codeSELECTcode, and in most examples the pipelined functions are used for data generation or transformation accepting a custor as parameter, but not issuing any DML statements.p  pNow, technically, it is possible to use SELECTs without any error from Oracle a hrefhttpwww.dbaoracle.comt5Fora5F145515Fcannot5Fperform5Fa5Fdml5Foperation5Finside5Fa5Fquery.htm relnofollowORA 14551a will not occur. However, I have experiences reproducible strange behavior of the select even though codePRAGMA AUTONOMOUSTRANSACTIONcode is emnotem being used, the rows retrieved by the codeSELECTcode seem emnotem always taking the current local transaction into account, which feels like a bug to me. Even more disturbing is the fact that, when using a distributed transaction for instance via ORAMTS instead of a local transaction, the transaction is used.p  pstrongEditstrong As it turns out, the strange effect seems related to some WITH statements in the query, which sometimes work and sometimes not depending on the current mood of the Oracle optimizer, at least in 10g. In some cases, I get a ORA32036, then again it doesnt occur, without changing the code at all. Now it looks as if the queries which sometimes fail with the ORA32036 are the ones which also fail to use the correct transaction, and it may be unrelated to the pipelined function.p  pSo my specific questions arep  ul lipIs there any, preferably official, statement whether codeSELECTcodes in pipelined table functions are allowed and what their transactional context ispli lipIs there another way of modularizing commonly used queries which can be used in SQL statements just as table functions can with codeTABLEcodepli lipHas anyone also experienced such behavior and does maybe know more about it Ive looked into metalink, but unfortunately I didnt find anything specific on the topic.pli ul

For those who have not played Magic, other examples would be that some cards trigger an action when a player discards a card or play a spell of a certain color.p  pI was thinking I would probably have to have an event handler on the engine for each circumstance which would trigger an event player plays a spell, player life total changes and that each card would have to somehow add an element to some list allow it to link itself to that event, but I couldnt even start to think of a good way to do it.p  pAny help would be greatly appreciated.

Negative 25194 pWe have been using ddeexec registry entries to handle opening a design from Explorer.p  pa hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibrarycc14417128vVS.8529.aspxcanonicalverbs relnofollowMSDNa about 23 way into article indicates that ddeexec is deprecated, and applications should use IDropTarget instead.p  pWhat is unclear to me is how that this actually is supposed to work..p  pe.g. If I have Foo.exe, which is intended to handle .foo files, what does the registry look likep  precodeHKCR.foo  default  Foo.foo.1  HKCRFoo.foo.1  shell   open    command     default   codepre  pIf the command is set to the obvious p  precodeCProgram FilesFoo CorpFoo.exe 1  codepre  pthen Foo.exe is launched each time the user double clicks on, or chooses open from the context menu for a .foo file.p  pHowever, that means a separate instance of Foo.exe is launched for every file that the user attempts to launch.  YUCK.p  pI can certainly write custom code to somehow pass on the filename from the 2nd instance of Foo.exe back to the first instance of Foo.exe and then exit... but then Im writing a fair bit of custom code.  p  pDDE used to handle this gracefully enough by asking the already running first instance of Foo.exe to open the specified file.  This made it easy to have an MDI app skillfully handle opening multiple documents, where each one was opened within the one instance of Foo.exe.p  pIf DDE is deprecated, then what is the preferred mechanism  Our app makes much more sense as an MDI app  we certainly dont want several instances of Foo.exe running that would only annoy our users.  I certainly dont want to have to write a new FooShim.exe which looks for the real instance of Foo.exe, and uses some custom mechanism to pass the filename being opened to it.  I cant just use Foo.exe for this purpose, because Foo.exe is big, and slow to load, and requires an activation security code which is counted per instance, and so may refuse to start up if youre at your maximum concurrent user limit.p  hr  pI dont see anything in IDropTarget which looks like it has much of anything to do with this common scenario.p  pDoes anyone know what MS intended herep

The database access happens during a transaction that is managed via the AOPtools of spring. There is one database table mapped to one Java entity, the mapping is done via annotations. There are two attributes in this entity that are CLOB in the database. They are annotated according to JPA with Lob and are Java Strings. Everthing works fine unless both attributes have values with more than 4000 characters After the commit the values are switched on the database, that is attribute A contains the value of attribute B and vice versa.p  pThis is not a joke   p  pThe Eclipse debugger tells me that the Java entity has the correct values until the transaktion closes I did not debug into the spring transaction handling.

Negative 25194 pGoogling this yields lots of entries on HOW TO step through Framework code. Im trying to find out how NOT TO step into.p  pFirst check Yes, Enable Just My Code is checked in the ToolsOptionsDebugging.  That is supposed to keep VS2010 from looking for source code when you are stepping through a framework function or anything else that you dont have the source to, as I understand it.p  pIts not.  Im trying to step through my code, using F11, and, if I get careless and dont switch to F10 to step over a function call when I get to a function that is in a library, then it throws up a dialog asking where the source for that call is, and when I cancel out of it since I dont have the source, it aborts my Debug, and I have to start all over.p  pHow can I avoid this behavior. As I understand the documentation, this is NOT the way it is supposed to work.  And where do we go for support when its not workingp

For example if member2 has string code11221code it will be 100 match, but if member3 has string like this code21121code it will be 60 match. And it has to be ordered by match percent.

Negative 25194 pIts a big question but I just need a push in the right direction. p  pI have a website being released soon. One of the services it provides is image hosting.

Negative 25194 pIt appears that on a particular system, dbghelp.dll is being loaded into all processes.  Since I believe this to not be normal behavior, I am guessing that it is being injected by some other application.  Is there a way to track down which app is doing this  The actual problem is that this injection is causing the system32dbghelp.dll to be loaded ahead of our own installed version.  And this is a prob, bc we need to be loading our installed version 6.7.5.0 which includes SymGetSymbolFile that is not found in the older dll.  I am currently taking bets that some other app, antivirus software, or virus is calling CreateProcessWithDll to load dbghelp.dll into all apps at execution time.  I just need some way to figure out who is doing thisp

Negative 25194 pI am writing a GLPaintesque drawing application for the iPad, however I have hit a stumbling block.

They also say that retained backing should pretty much always be set to NO. Is there a way to work my application in such a configuration I tried storing every drawing point into a continually expanding vertex array to be redrawn each frame, but due to the sheer number of sprites being drawn this isnt working.p  pI would really appreciate any help on this one, as Ive scoured online and found nothingp

Negative 25194 pHaving worked with .net in both winforms and ASP.net for a few years I am now starting to get into MVC a little late I know.  One major confusion for me is the concept of reusable components, similar to the concept of a usercontrol in webforms.p  pFor example, I would like to have a number of widgets within the members area of my site, one of which is the details of the logged in users account manager.  I can create this as a partial however when the page loads the data needs to be passed in as part of the ViewModel  View Data.  I would like to use this widget in a number of different sections which would then mean that I need to put the code to pass the data in into a number of different controllers.  This seems to violate the DRY principle, or am I missing something here  I would ideally like everything to be encapsulated within the 1 partial which can then be used in any page.p

The documentation found in a hrefhttpjava.sun.comdevelopertechnicalArticlesjavaseswingappfrhttpjava.sun.comdevelopertechnicalArticlesjavaseswingappfra says thatp  blockquote   pThe launch method calls the applications optional initialize method just prior to calling the startup method. You can use the initialize method to perform any initial configuration or setup steps. For example, you can process commandline arguments from within the initialize method. You can also check a database connection or set system properties. In short, the framework provides this method for any nonUI related setup that your application may need before displaying the UI. The Application and SingleFrameApplication classes provide an empty method body for the initialize method. The method does nothing by default. p blockquote  pAre we talking about the MyApp.initialize method here If so, there doesnt seem to be any reference to the args parameter.p  pEDIT This is not an applet, its a desktop application.

Negative 25194 pI would like the ability to set the systems ringtones from within my Android application.  I face a slightly interesting issue because I never once in my code refer to the sounds directly, and instead am using a setup that refers to them via ints, so the code I have found online for this doesnt quite apply to me.p  pIm not sure whether my code to set the ringtone is correct or not.  It does replace my ringtone, but it never replaces it with the sound I ask it to.  When I was using Uri.parse and giving it the path to find the correct file, it would replace the ringtone with nothing.  Now, using Uri.fromFile, and referring to the sound via a File, it replaces it with a typical telephone sound, which I assume is some sort of default.p  pI dont get any errors from this, but I do get one warning that seems relevant.  p  precodedataChanged but no participant pkgcom.android.providers.settings uid10096 codepre  pIt seems to me that I am just not referring to the file properly.  I can get the path to the sound in a String, and of course define them as a File, but I must be missing something somewhere.p  pAny ideas are appreciated, thank you.p  pEDIT   Well it seems that error only shows up when you change the ringtone.  So if I were to set the same sound as ringtone again, it would not show up, but if I were to set a different sound it would.  To me this still means that it is seeing everything I am doing, but I am not referencing to the sound properly, so it doesnt know what to put there.p  pEDIT  These are the main points of the errors I get when I try to use the same setup that is posted in other examples of settings ringtones.p  pThese are when I first try to set it as a ringtone p  precode0201 115120.709 ERRORMediaPlayerService1157 Couldnt open fd for contentsettingssystemringtone  0201 115120.709 ERRORMediaPlayer13807 Unable to to create media player  0201 115120.709 ERRORRingtoneManager13807 Failed to open ringtone contentsettingssystemringtone  0201 115120.709 ERRORMediaPlayer13807 Unable to to create media player  0201 115120.716 WARNRingtone13807 Couldnt set the stream type  0201 115120.716 WARNRingtone13807 java.io.IOException setDataSourceFD failed. status0x80000000 codepre  pAnd this is if I go into my volume settings and change the volume of the ringtone p  precode0201 115123.568 ERRORMediaPlayer13807 Unable to to create media player  0201 115123.568 ERRORRingtone13807 play caught   0201 115123.568 ERRORRingtone13807 java.io.IOException setDataSourceFD failed. status0x80000000 codepre

Negative 25194 pIm designing Java Web application framework. The framework is applied the typical 3 layers as architecture, presentationbusinessintegration.p  pGenerally, I think the definition of business layer is The business login not depending to the concrete implementation of persistence process and integration layer is the concrete implementation of persistence process.p  pHere, Im wondering which layer is appropriate to place the function to send mail. My opinion is, as a rule, business layer should not access outside of the system directly, so sending mail should be placed in the integration layer though it doesnt access to DB or any persistence. By the reason, functions like reading config files are the same, too.p  pI want to decide the rule with considering of various opinion, so please tell me your opinion with the reason.p  pP.S. Here sending mail doesnt mean the processes like desiding to send, composing message, selecting the destination. I think its a duty of business layer. Here sending mail just means the sending procedure itself.p

So the question is it better to store 20 rows of 79 columns that would all need to be pulled at once or 1 row of 140143 columnsp  p2 Given my data examples 40,2.23,1024 are good examples of what will be stored Im thinking codesmallintcode for the structure type. Any feedback there, performancewise or otherwisep  p3 Any other feedback on mysql performance issues or tips is welcome.p  pThanks in advance for your input.p
Negative 25194 pThere are several questions on this, and reading them isnt helping me. In Eric Evans DDD, he uses the example of address being a value type in certain situations. For a mail order company, the address is a value type because it doesnt really matter if the address is shared, who else lives at the address, simply that the package arrives at the address.p  pThis makes sense to me until I start thinking about how this would be designed. Given the diagram on page 99, he has it like thisp  precode Customer      customerId   name         street       city         state         codepre  pThis changes top  precode Customer     entity  customerId   name         address         Address      value object  street       city         state         codepre  pIf these were tables, Address would have its own Id in order to have a relationship with the customer, turning it into an entity.p  pIs the idea that in a relational database these would stay in the same table, such as in the first example, and that youd use features of the ORM to abstract address as a value object such as nHibernates component featuresp  pI realize that a couple of pages later he talks about denormalization, Im just trying to make sure Im understanding the concept correctly.p

Negative 25194 pI have used Apache HttpClient together with java.sun.net.httpserver as Server. The Server handles HttpGet Requests. Att the beginning, the server sets a session cookie using setcookie header, wich is accepted by the apache httpclient according to log, but the problem is that the cookie is never stored nor sent back to the server by the client. I have tested the server app with some web browsers and that all worked ok. So the problem seems to be on the client side, especially taking into account the fact, that all the cookies are accepted accoarding to log with log4j.p  precodeDEBUG [org.apache.http.impl.conn.SingleClientConnManager] Get connection for route HttpRoute[gthttplocalhost] DEBUG [org.apache.http.impl.conn.DefaultClientConnectionOperator] Connecting to localhost127.0.0.180 DEBUG [org.apache.http.client.protocol.RequestAddCookies] CookieSpec selected bestmatch DEBUG [org.apache.http.client.protocol.RequestAuthCache] Auth cache not set in the context DEBUG [org.apache.http.impl.client.DefaultHttpClient] Attempt 1 to execute request DEBUG [org.apache.http.impl.conn.DefaultClientConnection] Sending request GET loginpass2GiKzj9 HTTP1.1 DEBUG [org.apache.http.headers] gtgt GET loginpass2GiKzj9 HTTP1.1 DEBUG [org.apache.http.headers] gtgt Host localhost DEBUG [org.apache.http.headers] gtgt Connection KeepAlive DEBUG [org.apache.http.headers] gtgt UserAgent ApacheHttpClient4.1.1 java 1.5 DEBUG [org.apache.http.impl.conn.DefaultClientConnection] Receiving response HTTP1.1 200 OK DEBUG [org.apache.http.headers] ltlt HTTP1.1 200 OK DEBUG [org.apache.http.headers] ltlt Transferencoding chunked DEBUG [org.apache.http.headers] ltlt Contenttype texthtml DEBUG [org.apache.http.headers] ltlt Setcookie SESSID0.6092204529970631 expiresTue, 19411 182843 GMT MaxAge3600 Path Version1 DEBUG [org.apache.http.client.protocol.ResponseProcessCookies] Cookie accepted [version 0][name SESSID][value 0.6092204529970631][domain localhost][path ][expiry Sun Apr 19 192843 CET 11].

Negative 25194 pI use jqTransform and as you can tell by having a look at my recent questions, its giving me a hard time.p  pIve seen a few alternatives in the web but I wonder if theres something really worth it Sometimes I cant tell if the script or technique that I found is two months old or two years.p  pIm interested in skinning inputs but more importantly, selects dropdowns.p  pEDIT Its not what jqTransform cant do, its what it wont let me do. I need to reskin my selects, be it with jquery or a css technique or something else without losing the functionality of the selects. With jqTransform I have issues getting the selected values of the selects when you have more than one on the form because they dont have ids after they get reskinned ofc you can work around that but so far its only been a headache. p

In an admin tool I allow someone to assign a banner image to section on the website. In the admin tool they can select the section and the page they want the banner image to show. They can also set the default banner images for that section. So if there were no banner images assigned to a section by default it will load the banner images assigned to 0 for that section throughout the website. So instead of assigning a default banner image to 50 different pages they can just do it one time and it will load the default banner image or images for that section.

Negative 25194 pWhen a selector is called in ObjectiveC, and the app crashes, resulting in the debug stack pointing to a selector, what is the cause of this From what I understand, this happens as a result of a memory error. However, both the object I am sending the command to, and the parameter an array are valid.  I can tell because these two objects reveal memory locations as well as other info when moused over in Xcode.p  pSince the trace ends at this selector, I am at a loss.  I have never seen this error when the stack points to a selector with valid object parameters.p  pFurthermore, this selector is called frequently.  It always deals with the same types of objects, and there is nothing to suggest abnormal behaviour before my crash.br This crash is infrequent, happening every 10 minutes or less.  p  pSince I am a novice programmer, there is likely something wrong with the code inside the selector.  Often I compare object pointers like sop  precodeif thisObject.pointerToSomeObject  nil  do stuff... codepre  pI am beginning to doubt this is proper ObjectiveC programming, but then again, the code works most of the time.

Negative 25194 pI have been working on a classloader leak in our application and finally got to a point where all references to the CL were gone.  In my memory profiling tool using YourKit and jmapjhat, I can force a GC that sometimes will immediately get rid of my classloader, but then other times depends on application usage but thats as specific as I can get when I force the GC, the CL instance doesnt go away.  I capture a memory snapshot and look at the results and it says that this object exists, but is unreachable.p  pHeres the wacky part... and I only discovered this by accident.p  pI can force full GCs all I want but the instance just doesnt go away.  HOWEVER, after 1020 minutes, if I do another full GC, it emdoesem get collected.p  pDuring this time period the application is mostly inactive not totally.  My extended coffee break was the accident that led to this discovery.p  pSo my concern about a leak here is gone hopefully, but the question is now more of trying to explain this behavior.p  pAnyone know what might cause the sun JVM to decide to not collect an unreachable classloader for 20 minutesp  pSun JVM version detailsp  precodejava version 1.6.023 JavaTM SE Runtime Environment build 1.6.023b05 Java HotSpotTM 64Bit Server VM build 19.0b09, mixed mode codepre

This makes the MVC framework ideal for developers who want full control over the behavior of an application.p  pIt uses a Front Controller pattern that processes Web application requests through a single controller. This enables you to design an application that supports a rich routing infrastructure. For more information, see Front Controller.p  pIt provides better support for testdriven development TDD.p  pIt works well for Web applications that are supported by large teams of developers and for Web designers who need a high degree of control over the application behavior.p  pstrongAdvantages of a Web FormsBased Web Applicationstrongp  pThe Web Formsbased framework offers the following advantagesp  pIt supports an event model that preserves state over HTTP, which benefits lineofbusiness Web application development. The Web Formsbased application provides dozens of events that are supported in hundreds of server controls.p  pIt uses a Page Controller pattern that adds functionality to individual pages. For more information, see Page Controller.p  pIt uses view state on serverbased forms, which can make managing state information easier.p  pIt works well for small teams of Web developers and designers who want to take advantage of the large number of components available for rapid application development.p  pIn general, it is less complex for application development, because the components the Page class, controls, and so on are tightly integrated and usually require less code than the MVC model.p  hr  pBecause I am a newbie on MVC but not on webforms, I have the following questions regarding this advantages and disadvantagesp  ol lipMVC has no viewstate So how can I save data in the current page  This seems a very big disadvantage.pli lipWebform says that provide an extensive event model with lots of controls, Doesnt MVC support controls and events as a normal webformpli ol  pLets suppose I am an expert on both why would I choose one or the other So far the only good thing about MVC in my opinion is testability, becase Rapid Application Development in webforms win in so many ways to MVC.Just my opinionp  pNow talking about the RazonEngine, it seems like going back to the old ASP, you cant use server side controls how is this an advantage for mep
Negative 25194 pWCF does not support request streaming aka streaming upload of large data over HTTP with HTTP authentication. My first guess was it is because of authentication handshake causing the streaming request to be send twice to the server. But that is also the case for large request in buffered mode so it doesnt make sense.p  pYou can easily implement request streaming with HTTP authentication in custom ASP.NET http handler. If you have control over the client you can even avoid multiple requests problem by doing explicit HTTP HEAD to preauthenticate to server and then reuse persistent connection to do the actual streaming request with HTTP POST.p  pSo can anybody think of the reasons WCF not supporting this other than no time to do thatp  pThanksp

Negative 25194 pI have a database on SQL Server 2000. There are only two logical files in the PRIMARY file group the data file and the log file. However, when restoring the database to SQL Server 2008 R2, there is now a new logical file named codeftrowTable1Field1code with a file name codeftrowTable1Field1GUID.ndfcode. emIve replaced the actual table, field name, and GUID for simplicity.em The path to the .ndf file is codeMSSQL1050.MSSQLSERVERMSSQLFTDatacode.p  pI did not create this logical file, nor did I enable fulltext search on the database. codeField1code was originally a codeTEXTcode data type in SQL Server 2000, which Ive changed via TSQL to a codeVARCHARMAXcode column. This is also not the only column Ive converted from codeTEXTcode to codeVARCHARMAXcode.p  pCan anyone shed some light on what is going on herep  pEDIT I did another restore without running my massive TSQL scripts for the next software release. Direct from the SQL Server 2000 backup, it creates this file. Looking at the Properties of the field in SSMS, it says Full Text is False. The data type is codeTEXTcode. This is not the only codeTEXTcode field in the database.p

Negative 25194 pDoes anyone know of a framework, preferably some way to have the Flex compiler run an extension or perhaps just a build step that we could generate strongly typed proxy classes of our applications data models.p  pThere are 2 main things we want to do with the proxysp  ol liAt runtime we want to lazily parse and instantiate the instance as accessed similiar to how Javas Hibernate has Lazy proxy objectsli liIn an editor application we want to implement setter calls so we can track which objects have been modified ul liThe Proxy is really necessary in this situation beyond things like programatically setting up ChangeWatcthers because we need to track Array addsremove and possibly track reference objects so that when a reference key is changed we know to save those objects that are referencing it by keyli ulli ol  pIn the first case we want the proxy to basically abstract when that object is loaded from serialized data, but still pass around references of it with the same public properties and data access pattern if it were the real object.p  pBasically the proxy would instantiate the object the first time a method is called on it.p  pI know we could use some AS3 bytecode libraries like a hrefhttpwww.as3commons.orgas3commonsbytecodeindex.html relnofollowas3commonsbytecodea.p  pOr possibly repurposing the GraniteDS Code Generation.p  pId prefer to generate code because it is a deterministic thing and itd be nice if we could have a way to debug it at runtime easier.p  pDoes anyone know if I could do something like MXMLC does when it generates AS3 code from MXML files. p  pAlso is there anyway to control when in the compilation pipeline I can generate code, because we have a lot of data objects using public fields instead of gettersetters, but that are [Bindable] and so if I could generate the proxy based on the generated gettersetter methods that would work.p  pHeres an example application data object and proxy classesp  precode[Bindable] public class PersonDTO implements Serializable      private var nameString      private var ageNumber       public function get ageNumber          return age           public function set ageaNumbervoid          age  a           public function get nameString          return name           public function set namenStringvoid          name  n           public void readObjectdata          ...

Negative 25194 pIm trying to reverse engineer my database via the SQL Server Wizard in the VS2010 database project template.

Negative 25194 pI am currently using auto mapper and I think it is a good tool but I dont like how it cant handle view model to domain situations. It kinda sucks that I have to go in the automapping and map each one.p  pI been looking around and been reading about valueinjecter and how it can handle this. I am wondering though can it do these features what automapper hasp  ol liCan you make something like resolvers and formattersli liCan you combine values. For instance on the client side I have a datetime but it is broken into 2 different textboxesone has a timepicker one has a datepicker. Of course in the database it is stored as one field.li ol  pSo in my domainwhat is later used with nhibernate I have DateTime DateChoosen. In my view model I would have String Date, String Time. p  pRight now in automapper I have a resolveror formatter I cant remember that takes both of the view model values and converts it into a DateTime and then maps it to the domain.p  pCan I do something like this in valueinjecterp  pI also been looking around and found this a hrefhttpvalueinjecter.codeplex.comwikipagetitleAutomapper20SimulationampreferringTitleHome relnofollowAutomapper simulation with the ValueInjectera. I am wondering if this would have all the automapper features or if it just makes the syntax look like automapper.p  pIf it actually uses automapper too, does anyone know if they keep using the most current versionsp

It saves a copy of the pdfs into pdffiles map.

I have been trying to use pathinfoFILES[filename][name], PATHINFODIRNAME but it only gives me the relative path, ie .p  ppathinfoFILES[filename][name], PATHINFOBASENAME returns pdffile1.pdf as it should.p  pI have also trying to use realpathFILES[filename][name] hoping it will give me the whole path information CtestRitningsregister  without any luck.p  pWhat I at least could establish is that when I am trying to open a pdf file whose pathway has beforehand been imputed into MySQL say CtestRitningsregisterpdffile1.pdf.

Negative 25194 pWhen using Unity 2.0 for dependency injection within a web application, it appears that user controls, pages, etc will all need make explicit calls to retrieve the container and fetch the dependencies  so using the annotations like code[dependency]code wont offer any value. This is likely since the location of the container application context, http context cache, etc. is unknown in the web configuration.p  pSince Unity itself provides method interception, isnt there a way to tell unity how to fetch the container correctly when you build your own web application  Rather than having to create base classes for page, etc.p

Negative 25194 pI am writing a console application using Visual Studio and C. I am constantly printing out debugging information to the console window.p  pThe program is fairly simple, it just queries several databases multiple times and stores the values in my central database.

At the point when it is querying the databases, it will occasionally and randomly stall on the console window, and ceases to print out debugging information or go any further in the program.

Negative 25194 pI have some qml that acts as the output from the application kind of like a readonly console.

I scroll to the bottom, a second later, a line of text is printed causing it to scroll back to the top.p  pThe desired functionality I would like is to automatically scroll to the bottom much like how a console is when it prints stuff out unless the user overrides this by scrolling up, then the text should stay put.

I was wondering if you would be able to provide me with some assistance regarding wso2 identity server.  I have downloaded the identity server and I am using tomcat as my application server I have already deployed a web service and now I would like to use the identity server as an xacml engine. the problem is I am finding it hard to connect the two together,  I do not know how to make the two communicate with one another and how to make the identity server act as the xacml engine for the tomcat application.  I would really appreciate it if you would give me the steps I need to take in order to make it happen.  at the moment I just need an example of how it is done, the policies do not need to be complicated just as long as it provides access control to the tomcat application.  Any help would be appreciated, or if you know of a blog that shows how to do what am looking for then please let me know, thank you in advance for you help.p

Negative 25194 pThis has been bugging me for a few days now. I have written a multifunctional messageBox class, and it works pretty well, but theres one thing Im stuck on. First, though, heres some codep  pin the document class I havep  precodevar tMsgMsg  new MsgTest Message, This is a test Message, Msg.INPUT  tMsg.addEventListenerAnswered, qa, false, 0, true  function qaeEventvoid     tracee.target.label,e.target.result     tLabel.label  e.target.result  codepre  pWhen either the cancel or ok buttons are clicked, the result property is set and the Answered event is dispatched. Since this event listener will always need to be added, I thought it would be better to include it within the class constructor however, each instance of the Msg class would need its own callback, depending on what the result is being used for. Also, the callback functions should be declared in the document class.p  pI thought this could be accomplished by simply passing the function to the Msg class constructor, and then use that reference to generate the addEventListener dynamically. For examplep  precode in document class var tMsgMsg  new MsgTest Message, This is a test Message, Msg.INPUT, qa  function qaeEventvoid     tracee.target.label,e.target.result     tLabel.label  e.target.result    in Msg class public function MsgtxtString, msgString, typeStringALERT, callbackObjectnull      callback  callback     addEventListenerEvent.ADDED, setup, false, 0, true  private function setupeEvent     stage.addEventListenerAnswered, callback, false, 0, true  codepre  pThis doesnt work. I dont know if its because Im trying to store the callback reference the event listener should be added to the stage object or what The upside to getting this to work would be I wouldnt have to add an event listener each time I create a new message, just pass along the associated function.p  pThank you in advance for any help you could provide me.p

Negative 25194 pThis is my second question, and Im hoping to resolve an issue that I havent found addressed, though I did search for an answer. p  pLinks and screenshots to problem are below. Using Fireworks CS5, I have created an animated gif consisting of 3 states that loops 3 times. It is built on layers, with the 3 states sharing only a background border. They do not share the background the background is grouped layer consisting of a red box with a clipping path of white, which seems to work in the first two states, but fails in the third state itself, or any other element. p  pIt is a tile ad for an html enewsletter, and it works on some clients gmail, for instance, but the final state does not render properly in other clients mac mail, for instance. To add to the issue, the same file was rendering correctly in Mac Mail earlier. The gif works if I open it in a browser usually, as well. p  pI thought that animated gifs were very stable across platforms except for problems with looping in Outlook 2007 and Ive never had this issue before granted my experience is limited. Has anyone else had this experience Does anyone have advice on this issue p  pMany thanks,br  Andrew.p  pba hrefhttpwww.thurmancreekmedia.comTEMPmacAnimatedDRAFT5.gif relnofollowLink to the good.ab This is the animated gif file.

Negative 25194 pIm developing an application for android on Unity3d engine. This application must connect to my server on PC via network sockets. I found some Unity3d plugin examples for Android. Based on them Ive written some code on c for Unity3d and on Java for Android. I found out that network operations must not run in UIthread in Android application. So I have to use AsynTask for network requests. Also Ive tried to call nonstatic methods from c script but they dont return any data. Only static calls return data from java application. So my AsyncTask class is static. But when I call static function with AsyncTask job to get data through network my application is crashed. I receive errors. Could you help me to fix my problems I see two ways to fix this problem 1 Change my c code for Unity3d to get data through NonStatic method calls. Change all methods to NonStatic in Java code. 2 Change my Java code to work with static methods and static AsyncTask.p  pMy c script AndroidClientPlugin.csp  precodeusing UnityEngine using

Negative 25194 pWe are using Eclipse for our projects and we would like to revision control the JDK we use.  Different projects need to use different JDKs.

Ive seen some sample code solutions to the problem, but they all have been too complex and overly elaborate for me to understand. p  pUsing mutexes, I want to implement a simulation where the main creates a series of threads in a loop, where each thread calls two functions enterBathroom and leaveBathroom.

Negative 25194 pI have an abstract codeCommandcode class.  Every codeCommandcode class created from a certain class, codeFetchercode, needs to be endowed with certain properties.  Normally this looks like a factory pattern  codeFetchercode creates a codeCommandFactorycode that will prepare the codeCommandcode when creating it.  However there are about a dozen derived classes and I dont see how to do this without having a different concrete factory for each concrete class, or a different method codecreateConcrete1Commandcode that will have to be extended each time a new codeCommandcode class is created.  Is there any strategy for thisp

Negative 25194 pIm working on a Java server exposing RESTful interface.

Negative 25194 pThis problem concerns a straightforward generalization of the Deutsch problem discussed for functions with more than one bit as input. This time, we have a Boolean function f that takes a 4bit number as input and outputs 0 or 1, i.e., codef0,140,1code. Thus, an input to f is one of 16 possible 4 bit binary numbersp  precode0000, 0001, 0010, 0011, 0100, 0101, 0110, 0111, 1000, 1001, 1010, 1011, 1100, 1101, 1110, 1111. codepre  pWe are also told that f is one of the following two typesp  precodeeither f is a constant function, i.e., fx is the same for all 16 possible values of the input x, or f is a balanced function, i.e., fx is 0 for exactly 8 of the possible 16 inputs and fx is 1 for the remaining 8 of the possible 16 inputs. codepre  pwe are allowed to do is to use the circuit for f as a black box by giving an input x to the circuit for f and observing the output fx. This is called a query operation.p  pShow that a classical probabilistic algorithm can determine if f is balanced or constant with probability at least 23 by using 2 queries.p  pstrongHintstrong Obviously, we cannot do this using a deterministic algorithm. Unless the deterministic algorithm sees the output for at least 9 input values, there is no way for it to find out if the function is balanced or constant.p  pThink about picking the two inputs uniformly and randomly from the set of 16 possible inputs. Your final result could depend probabilistically on the result of these two queries.p

Negative 25194 pI load grid into Kendo splitter. But when I move splitter bar, a horizontal grid height increases as a horizontal scroll bar appears. This causes the splitter to have height as there was no horizontal scroll bar in the grid, the pane containing grid also has the height before the scroll bar appeared. This produces the pane to have a vertical scroll bar, which I dont want to have. OnResize event of the splitter does not deal with this appearing scroll bar properly.p

I need to know where do I put my business logic in MVC pattern. In other words we can say from where I need to call my middle layer. From the Models or from the Controllersp  pIf I call my business logic from Controller then It seem like the Models are useless. Other wise if I call business logic from the model then it seems like unnecessary bidden on the system because Business Object maps with model and then model is passed to the Controller.

Negative 25194 pIll try to explain a big problem that has me stumped.p  pBasically, I have a menu that goes between absolute positionedwhen close to the top of the page and fixed positionedto the top of the window, when scrolling down the page. Im using jquery to accomplish this.p  pWhen it gets fixed, I give it a .fixed class. Which gives it top0pxpositionrelative. menu has a transition to it, but menu.fixed removes the transition. This works great in the beginning, when scrolling down and then having it become attached to the top of the window. Switching the positions is flawless as the new class has the transitions removed.p  pHowever, when I scroll back up, and it removes the .fixed class, it animates the now absolutely positioned menu from 0px to 615px. Which means it jumps up to the top of the page, and then scrolls down, as its not fixed anymore.p  pThis is the codep  precodemenu.css top 615px  top was 0px before this. It is still fixed, so it should NOT animated. menu.removeClassfixed  Now the transition kicks in As its at 615px, it should stay where it is, not start animating to 615px from 0px as it does. codepre  pI think its because the element hasnt actually been repositioned by the time the .fixed class is removed, and thus it animates down with its new positioning... I could do an interval or something similar to trigger the class to be removed, but it just seems silly.p  pIm also aware that I could just make it positionedabsolutely all the time. And just reposition the topvalue when I scroll. But that seems redundant...p  pDoes anyone know how to solve my problemp

When I check for an empty post array in the codeifcode statement, Node ignores it. The console output shows codeposts  []code yet it skips right over it and then an error is thrown on codelastDate  posts.slice1[0].publishdatecode I know JS behaves funny with empty values null, undefined, empty string, etc. but Ive tried different ones with the same result. It seems like its ignoring it completely. Am I taking crazy pillsp

Negative 25194 pThis makes no sense to me, and hopefully I can explain this right.p  pI have a basic jQuery Mobile application that uses Asp.Net MVC 4.  After logging in to the application, if I click the account button in the upper left, the page loads, but is missing themes.  If I then click refresh, everything looks fine.p  pI compared the resulting HTML in Chromes F12 window.  The second page is of course correct.  The first page contains all the same HTML, however, an emadditionalem div is placed at the start of the body.  This div is showing the main application page to my application.  It has a datarole of page and is hidden from view.  I can only assume jQuery Mobile is only applying a theme to the first datarole page that it finds and is therefore skipping the correct one.p  pWhy do I get a different page from clicking on account vs clicking refresh when on the account  p  p[EDIT]  Two people asked for code.

But where will it get the correct article information from for the various HTML tags and DIVs on the page Should it be in ifelse statements or should it be stored in a database p  pI was thinking storing it in a database might be tedious... you would have store all the paragraph and ordered list information in a table.

Negative 25194 pIm using TfsVersion Activity 2012, it is very confusing for me, and the current documentation is for TFS 2010 at a hrefhttptfsbuildextensions.codeplex.comwikipagetitleHow20to20integrate20the20TfsVersion20build20activityampreferringTitleDocumentation relnofollowhttptfsbuildextensions.codeplex.comwikipagetitleHow20to20integrate20the20TfsVersion20build20activityampreferringTitleDocumentationa. p  pI have follow this documentation. I got to the point I can find all assembly files and print the messages out. p  pHowever I need some guidelines to set the properties of TfsVersion Activity for TFS 2012.  I have already created variables Major, Minor, VersionNumber and set the properties roughly the same with the current documentation. But I got errors  Major is required. Version is required. p  pSo the questions where in the process suppose to read out the version number from AssemblyInfo files What variable is getting set that value How Major an Minor works Do they automatically get value from... something Do we or can we set Major and Minor variables Where in the process set the final output Version variable if its been set in the background Or do we have to set it manually I have found the document for these variables, just dont know what the process to set them and when do we suppose to use them.  Major  Gets or Sets the Major component of the version number.  Minor  Gets or Sets the Minor component of the version number.  Version  Gets or sets the Version. p  pThanks a lot for your help. p

Negative 25194 pIve been at this for about 12 hours.  All of the google links are purple that have anything to do with MDM.  I swear to all that matters that Ive tried everything.  Ive regenerated the Vendor and Customer CSRs, keys, etc a dozen times and cannot get a push notification to work.p  pHeres what Ive donep  ol liCreated a vendor CSR, exported the private key as vendor.p12li liLogged into Apple Provisioning Portal and generated the MDM CSR Certificateli liDownloaded that certificate and called it vendor.cerli liRun this command openssl pkcs12 in vendor.p12 nocerts out vendor.pemli liI then created a second CSR in Keychain Utility called customer.csrli liI used the cool python script found here a hrefhttpsgithub.comgrinichmdmvendorsign relnofollowhttpsgithub.comgrinichmdmvendorsignali liI ran the command for this script python mdmvendorsign.py  csr customer.csr key vendor.key mdm vendor.cerli liThis generated a plist cert request that I then uploaded to a hrefhttpsidentity.apple.compushcert relnofollowhttpsidentity.apple.compushcertali liI downloaded the certificate and called it clientpush.pemli liI attempted to check and see if it works by running this command openssl sclient connect gateway.sandbox.push.apple.com2195 cert push.pem key vendor.pem.

Besides, how will I get the customers private keyp  pThe last thing to try was the vendors cert and key, which seemed to work the exact same as using the customers key and cert.p  pWhich combination is the correct wayp  pOn a side note, do I need to do anything to convert the data push token to a regular push token  It says its base64 encoded.  Do I need to decode itp  pstrongUPDATEstrongp  pIve read that the token is a 32 byte base64 encoded string.  Im using PHP to send the push notification os I figure a bin2hextbase64decodeToken will work.  It looks legitimate when I do that at least.  Sill no push notification.p  pIve also tried all possible combinations and the only time I can get it to send the notification without any errors i when I use both the vendor Key and Cert in the same PEM file.  The message still never arrives.  Ive also tried and successfully generated the PEM cert file from identity.apple.compushcert quite a few times.  It says it worked on that page.  p  pIm using the Push library for the Laravel framework.  All it asks for is a certificate file, the push server host, and a pem password.  p  pIm getting this error when I try to use the pem file generated from identity.apple.compushcertp  pstreamsocketclient Unable to set local cert chain file UsersnebDevwwwcgmdmtrunkappcertificatesMDM.p12 Check that your cafilecapath settings include details of your certificate and its issuerp

Negative 25194 pIm trying to use Class Table Inheritance within ZF2 and Doctrine 2.  My implementation is pretty simple.  I think I have the class structure all set, but I think there might be a problem with some setup somewhere.  Unfortunately, I have found a lot of documentation on the Class setup, but not a whole lot on the YML implementation.  Everyone seems to resort to using the doctrine tools to generate everything.

Negative 25194 pI have an encoderdecoder code, it takes word dumps with whitespaces with a n in the end as input, and encodes the top 5 word occurrences in the text, and vice versa. It seems to be working as charm, but my supervisor program still gives 6 fails from 10 times. I encode the input file, then decode the encoded input file, and it works perfectly. Still dont understand whats wrong with it. Please guys I need your eyes p  pSimple encoder Find the 5 most common  at least 3 char long  words in a file, and replace them with a short code. The codes are 2 char long, and look like this 1 2...5. 1 replaces the word with the most occurrences in the text, and 5 replaces the word with the least occurrences. If two words have the same occurrence, the first in line goes first in the codelist sooner better. The rest of the words have to be untouched. In the beginning of the encoded file, the codelist have to be presented. The program has to have decoding function as well. If the input starts with a , then it have to adapt the codelist, and decode the whole file, recovering the original state. Input Two kind of input files can exist. The original input contains a maximum of 2000 words with whitespaces between, a maximum of 22 characters each word. After the last word, there is no whitespace, but a newline n. Words are made from the letters of the english alphabet, all lowercase. Non of the words contains any  sign. There are always a minimum of 5 different kind of words with at least of 3 chars. Warning If the input format equals the output format, decoding is needed of course In case of decoding, the limit of 2000 words and 22 chars max are valid morover the codelist in the beginning of the file of course.

Negative 25194 pHow to find a way to make my code count the number of matching elements in two arrays of the same size same value, same position. For instance, if array1 has 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, and array2 has 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, there is one matching element, the 3. How can I get my code to perform this seemingly simple task And it would tell me how many by saying I have 1 that match 3 that match or any other numbers Like i want it to count how many that matched and give me a number.p  pThose are my two arrays that generate 100 numbers. I also want them to generate 10,000,000 numbers and im not sure how to do that They are generating 100 but i want it to be 10,000,000 howp  pAnd for this codep  precode        if store[t] store[w]                      maching  maching 1             System.out.printlnGenerated   maching                   return maching  codepre  pIt should count the matching ones and give me the amount that matches. But what it is doing is that it gives me like if three matched it gives me this Generated 1, Generated 1, Generated 1, instead of just giving me a 3. Also i commented the return matching out because it is giving me errors so i comment it out. Maybe if i get return matching to work would it solve the whole thing Im not sure what is causing the problem Thank you.p  pI want it to count how many numbers that matched between the two arrays. So when i get 6 numbers matched between those two arrays it should say that i got 6 that matched.p  precodeRandom randomGenerator  new Random  for int t  0 t lt 100 t      int randomNumber  randomGenerator.nextInt100     store[t]  randomNumber   int matching 0 for  int w  0 wlt 100 w      int randomNumber  randomGenerator.nextInt100     count[w]  randomNumber     int t 0      if store[t] count[w]              matching  matching 1         System.out.printlnGenerated   maching          System.out.printlnDone.  codepre
Negative 25194 pIm working on a program that loops through a specific directory example, CDocuments and calculates the total size taken up by it on the disk. For some reason, however, my program keeps throwing a null pointer exception at a point where it seems to be looking for a folder called My Music within the Documents folder. My Music does not exist in my Documents folder, so I am very confused about where it gets it from.

Negative 25194 pI am designing a face detection system using pure C. I dont wanna go though too much trouble of coding the training algorithm in C when it is easily available in openCV for ViolaJones and LBP. However, i noticed that in openCV the training data is stored in XML files. I am planning to run the detector on a TI development board and also use the DSP in the board. The board is running an ubuntu OS so it has a file system but am trying to make the detector work as fast as possible and I dont want the accessing of the training data to affect my detector speed. So is it a good idea to proceed with XML files Or is there a way to convert these files to CSV which I think is easier to read from.p  pThanks in advancep

Negative 25194 pI allocate a big region of memory lets say x of 1000 bytes.p  precode I am using c language and all of this is just pseudo codefunction prototypes mostly so far. pointer  malloc size1000 units   this pointer points to region of memory we created. codepre  pnow we select this region by a pointer and allocate memory inside it to smaller blocks likep  precodevoid allocatefromregion sizeofblock1300   1000300700 left free void allocatefromregion sizeofblock2100   700100 600 void allocatefromregion sizeofblock3300   600300 300  void allocatefromregion sizeofblock4100   300100 200 void allocatefromregion sizeofblock5150   200150 50  here we almost finished space we have in region only 50 is left free in region   boolean freefromregionpointertoblock2        free 100 more  total free  10050 but are not contiguous in memory  void allocatefromregion sizeofblock6150    this one will fail and gives null as it cant find 150 units memorycontiguous in region.  boolean freefromregionpointertoblock3  this free 300 more so total free  10030050 but contiguous free is 100300 from block 2 and 3  void allocatefromregion sizeofblock6150  this time it is successful  codepre  pAre there any examples about how to manage memory like thisp  pSo far I have only did examples where I can allocate blocks next to each other in a region of memory and and end it once I ran out of memory inside the region.

I am sure there should be some documentation or examples in c which shows how to do it.p

Negative 25194 pI am using jQuerys code.ajaxcode method in order to issue an XHR based HTTP GET to retrieve a partial of HTML from a Ruby on Rails site. In this particular case, whenever a use clicks on a tabbed navigation, I updated an HTML table with data that comes back from the server. The thing is, once the data is available on the server, it never changes. When a user clicks from one tab to the next, it needlessly makes more XHR requests to the server for data that it should already have andor be cached. I tried using the codecache truecode attribute, but I dont think that works like I thought it would.

Negative 25194 pIm working in a small C program and I need to embed binary data into an exe file.

Thats what I meanp  precodechar dataPntr  void LoadResource      char data[2048]  my binary data       dataPntr  malloc2048      for int i  0 i lt 2048 i dataPntr [i]  data[i]  codepre  pThat way, if my understanding is correct, when calling LoadResource data[] will be placed in stack, copied to heap and finally data[] will be automatically deallocated from stack heap copy should be manually deallocated with free.p  pIm doing it this way because the resource is only used in some situations, not always... and I prefer to avoid a large global variable.p  pMy questionsp  pWhen running the program, is data[] array placed somewhere in memory text segment maybe or is it just loaded into stack when calling LoadResourcep  pIs my solution the proper one in terms of memory management or would it be better to just declare a global data arrayp  pThanks for your answersp

What would be the best way to solve this problem I already searched for a solution, but most people seem to be happy to just merge it.

One XMLfile is the objects we have, according to the system and the other one what is really in the depot. So if one object appears on both lists, they have the absolute same ID, name, weight, etc. But the ID is the only thing, thats absolute uniquefor each object but of course should be in both files. So I need to know, which object are in the depot but not in the system, so I can import them, and which ones are in the system, but not in the depot, and so have to be labeld as lost.p  pSo just merging them, wont help...p  pA result likep  precodeonlyinsystem.xml ltdatagt    ltobjectgt       ltIDgt1ltIDgt       ltnamegtabcltnamegt       ltweightgt50ltweightgt    ltobjectgt ltdatagt  onlyindepot.xml ltdatagt    ltobjectgt       ltIDgt3ltIDgt       ltnamegtghiltnamegt       ltweightgt100ltweightgt    ltobjectgt ltdatagt  additional everythingisok.xml ltdatagt    ltobjectgt       ltIDgt2ltIDgt       ltnamegtdefltnamegt       ltweightgt75ltweightgt    ltobjectgt ltdatagt codepre  pwould be nice Also more individual transormations could be used and i think, have to in a rowp

However, with this code it starts with 0.1 for all of the fitting parameters. If I try codedirec1,0.1,1code, it uses an initial step of 1 for all parameters which destroys the fit, as the second parameter has a range of 0,1 and results in a division by zero if it ever goes negative.

Negative 25194 pI know how to check if Facebook like button is clicked by edge.create , but the website a hrefhttpaddmefast.com relnofollowaddmefast.coma , opens the Facebook page in new window, and when you close the window, the parent window gets something return that whether i clicked like or not. p  pi can check this in the same window, but how do they do it on a new window, which is on separate domain i.e Facebook.  They are not using any signed application or user permissions to check his likes etc.. p  pUPDATEp  pI read the javascript of the website, and what it does is checks the number of like before, and after opening the window, and then if the likes have increased they award you points, no matter whoever like the page in that time, i tested it, i opened the window for like, and did not like, and asked my friend to like it from his computer, and i was awarded points, so they cannot really check whether i liked it or no. Obviously they need to use signed Facebook app to do this.p

Negative 25194 pI have a flat file that I intend to import into a table via SSIS. The file has a field with dates in the format dmmyyyy. These dates eventually get stored into the Database as yyyymmdd. I know this because I run a datepart sql query on the table data to find out. I have no problem with how they are stored as I can format them via presentation. The problem is that for some of the dates, the days are swapped with the month values. ie 3051989 should be stored as 19890503, but it can end up as 19890305 and as such, the data presentation is inconsistent with what is in the CSV files. I have searched everywhere possible for a solution and trust me I can put the links here if you want. I tried exporting from one csv file to another csv file, that one saved dmmyyyy the same way dmmyyyy. My last attempt was this  a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions9315471dateformatissuewhileimportingfromaflatfiletoansqldatabaseDate format issue while importing from a flat file to an SQL databasea And as you can see, it hasnt still been marked as an answer.

Negative 25194 pLets say i have a custom control class that inherits the Control class in winforms. I spawn these controls in runtime and pile them into the controls collection of a panel. p  pNow I want to iterate through these custom controls and execute a sub specific to its class. At first thought, I wanted to iterate through the controls collection of the panel but this is no good since the control type doesnt have the sub Im looking for.p  pObviously, I could double store them in a duplicate list with the appropriate class.. The question is though, is there a better way to do this Like in various scripting languages Ive had the option to cast the type on spot or cast the entire collection to a cast reference.p

Negative 25194 pI am using the new GCM APIs in order to register. The documentation of the method clearly states p  blockquote   pRegister the application for GCM and return the registration ID. You   must call this once, when your application is installed, and send the   returned registration ID to the server.p      pRepeated calls to this method will return the original registration   ID.p blockquote  pHowever, while reading this article a hrefhttpdeveloper.android.comgooglegcmadv.htmlregstate relnofollowhttpdeveloper.android.comgooglegcmadv.htmlregstatea, it states that there are two cases that need special treatp  blockquote   pThere are also two other scenarios that require special carep      ul   liApplication updateli   liBackup and restoreli   ul      pWhen an application is updated, it should invalidate its existing registration ID, as it is not guaranteed to work with the new version.p blockquote  pSo, it not clear when the developer should invalidate or not the registration ID.p  pMoreover, regarding the unregister phase the new GCM API statesp  blockquote   pUnregister the application. Calling unregister stops any messages from the server. This is a blocking callyou shouldnt call it from the UI thread. You should rarely if ever need to call this method. Not only is it expensive in terms of resources, but it invalidates your registration ID, which you should never change unnecessarily. A better approach is to simply have your server stop sending messages. Only use unregister if you want to change your sender ID.p blockquote  pHowever the previous same article statesp  blockquote   pWhenever the application registers as described in Implementing GCM   Client, it should save the registration ID for future use, pass it to   the 3rdparty server to complete the registration, and keep track of   whether the server completed the registration. If the server fails to   complete the registration, it should try again or unregister from GCM.p blockquote  pThis is also not clear i.e. how to handle unregistration.p  pFinally, based on the above, it is not clear how Canonical IDs are related to the mobile. In case Google produce a Canonical ID for an existing registration and pass it back to the application backend, it will also change the registration ID of the mobile if it calls the register method Is there any other way for the mobile to get informed about this new ID p  pThank you very much in advancep

Negative 25194 pI couldnt find anything about this topic, maybe because Im not a good english speaker and cant find the right words to search for in google therefore.p  pIm currently working on an Chrome browser extension which enables me to search for user accounts on a specified web page by using the context menu. Example If I select the text codename123code on any webpage and click the context menu entry, a new tab codehttpwww.webpage.deusername123code is opened.p  pNow I want to extend the extensions capabilities I want to search for email addresses, too. For that I can use codehttpwww.webpage.desearchname123mail.comcode which brings up a list of all user with the email address codename123mail.comcode. From there, I could extract the link to the user account as followsp  precodedocument.getElementsByClassNamexyz[0].href codepre  pMy question Can I skip the loading of codehttpwww.webpage.desearchname123mail.comcode and the extraction of the url to the user account Respectively, can I hide the procedure of opening this additional web page Does JavaScript support any kind of preloading of a webpages content, without being displayed in the browserp

Negative 25194 pI am new to Ember JS and even JS in general. My app has a field object which can have one of two types either free text entry or a list of options to select from. In my form I am trying to make it so that when the type is Select Menu a set of extra input boxes will pop up which can be used to define the options for select. I need this second innerform to be dynamic so it can accept 2 or 3 or 10 or however many options for select. p  pMy initial thought on how to accomplish this was with a partial that would be rendered depending on the type.p  pHow do I make a form for the embedded options How do I make it so the user can enter as many options as they wantp  precodeApp.Field  DS.Model.extend Ember.Validations.Mixin,   title DS.attr string   type DS.attr string   selectoptions DS.hasMany selectoption, embedded true    validations     title presence true     type presence true codepre  pp  precodeApp.SelectOption  DS.Model.extend Ember.Validations.Mixin,   title DS.attr string    validations     title presence true codepre  pp  precodeApp.PmSetupFieldsNewController  Ember.ObjectController.extend   types [Text Entry, Select Menu]    actions     submit gt       getmodel.save.thenonCreate.bind, onFail.bind    onCreate gt     transitionToRoutepm.setup.fields.index    onFail gt     console.log failure    isSelect Ember.computed type, gt     gettype  Select Menu codepre  pp  precodeltdiv classcolmd8gt   lth4gtFieldlth4gt   formfor this wrapperbootstraphorizontal     input title     input type       labelfield type classcontrollabel colmd2       ltdiv classcolmd6gt         view Ember.Select contenttypes                             valuetype                             classNamesformcontrol                             promptSelect a Type         if view.showError           errorfield status         if       ltdivgt     input      if isSelect        render pm.setup.fields.selectOptions     if       ltdiv classformgroupgt       ltdiv classcolmd10 colmdoffset2gt         submit Save changes classbtn btnprimary       ltdivgt     ltdivgt   formfor ltdivgt codepre  pI really have no idea what the selectOptions partial Im rendering should look likep

Negative 25194 pThe only examples I can find addressing this sort of scenario are pretty old, and Im wondering what the best way is to do this with the latest version of ORMLite...p  pSay I have two tables simplifiedp  precodepublic class Patient     [AliasPatientId]    [Autoincrement]    public int Id  get set     public string Name  get set    public class Insurance     [AliasInsuranceId]    [Autoincrement]    public int Id  get set     [ForeignKeytypeofPatient]    public int PatientId  get set     public string Policy  get set     public string Level  get set   codepre  pPatients can have multiple Insurance policies at different levels primary, secondary, etc. I understand the concept of blobbing the insurance information as a Dictionary type object and adding it directly to the [Patient] POCO like thisp  precodepublic class Patient     public Patient        this.Insurances  new Dictionaryltstring, Insurancegt   string would be the Level, could be set as an Enum...

That is, I cant use the same nested object to automatically insertupdate both the Patient and InsurancePolicy tables at the same time. If I remove the [Ignore] decorator, I get a field in the Patient table called Insurances of type varcharmax. No good, rightp  pI guess Im going to need to write some additional code for my PUTPOST methods to extract the Insurances node from the JSON, iterate over it, and use each Insurance object to update the database Im just hoping Im not reinventing the wheel here or doing a ton more work than is necessary. p  pComments would still be appreciated Is Mythz on  Thanks...p

Negative 25194 pIve a question about the fairness of the critical sections on Windows, using EnterCriticalSection and LeaveCriticalSection methods. The MSDN documentation specifies There is no guarantee about the order in which threads will obtain ownership of the critical section, however, the system will be fair to all threads. The problem comes with an application I wrote, which blocks some threads that never enter critical section, even after a long time so I perfomed some tests with a simple c program, to verify this behaviour, but I noticed strange results when you have many threads an some wait times inside. This is the code of the test programp  precodeCRITICALSECTION CriticalSection  DWORD WINAPI ThreadFuncvoid data    int me   int i,c  0   me  int  data   printf d startedn,me   for i0 i lt 10000 i       EnterCriticalSectionampCriticalSection      printf d Trying to connect dn,me,c      ifi3 ampamp i4 ampamp i5          Sleep500      else          Sleep10     LeaveCriticalSectionampCriticalSection      c      Sleep500      return 0   int main    int i   int a[20]   HANDLE thread[20]    InitializeCriticalSectionampCriticalSection   for i0 ilt20 i          a[i]  i         thread[i]  CreateThreadNULL, 0, ThreadFunc, LPVOID ampa[i], 0, NULL     codepre  pThe results of this is that some threads are blocked for many many cycles, and some others enter critical section very often. I also noticed if you change the faster Sleep the 10 ms one, everything might returns to be fair, but I didnt find any link between sleep times and fairness. However, this test example works much better than my real application code, which is much more complicated, and shows actually starvation for some threads. To be sure that starved threads are alive and working, I made a test in my application in which I kill threads after entering 5 times in critical section the result is that, at the end, every thread enters, so Im sure all of them are alive and blocked on the mutex. Do I have to assume that Windows is really NOT fair with threads Do you know any solution for this problemp  pEDIT The same code in linux with pthreads, works as expected no thread starves.p  pEDIT2 I found a working solution, forcing fairness, using a CONDITIONVARIABLE. It can be inferred from this post a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions12685112pthreadsthreadstarvationcausedbyquickrelockinglinka, with the required modifications.p

Negative 25194 pWhat is the best strategy to synchronize Parse objects across the applicationp  pTake Twitter as an example, they have many Tweet objects, same tweet object can be shown on multiple places, say viewController1 and viewController2, so it is not efficient for both of them to hold deep copies of the same parse object.p  pWhen I increase the likeCount of Tweet168 in viewController2, how should I update the likeCount of Tweet168 in viewController1p  pI created a singleton container class TweetContainer so every Parse request goes through this and this checks if the incoming objectIds are already in the container,br A if it is, it updates the previous objects fields and dumps the new object. to keep strongsinglestrong deep copy of a parse object.br B if it is not, it adds the new object.br This process is fast as Im using hashmapsp  pThis container holds deep copies to those objects, and gives shallow copies to viewControllers, thus editing a Tweet in a viewController will result in its update on all viewControllersp  pTaking one step further, lets say Tweet objects have pointers to Author objects. When an Author object is updated, I want all of them to be updated say image change. I can create a new AuthorContainer with the same strategy and give shallow copies to Tweet objects in TweetContainer.p  pI could, in an strongidealstrong world, propagate every update to cloud and refresh every object before showing to user over the cloud, but thats not feasible neither bandwidth nor latencywisep

Negative 25194 pWell i tried to make a loop within a loop, kinda like that movie Inception. But it messes up some how, the second loop wont stop when i enter N for no, and wont go back to the the 1st loop, which is Continue with another set, when i enter Y for yes. Instead it keeps going back to the What value to check no matter what p  precodewhile true      2. Ask the user for size of arbitrary numbers.     System.out.printPlease enter a size for arbitray numbers      int size  indata.nextInt      int [] SortedNumbers  new int [size]       3. Process arbitrary numbers and remove all duplicates     int numDuplicates  generatedataSortedNumbers       4. Print the numbers and number of duplicates     printArraySortedNumbers, numDuplicates      while true          5. Ask user for target value         System.out.printnWhat target value to check          int target  indata.nextInt           6. Perform linear and binary search         int linearVal  linearsearchSortedNumbers,target         int binaryVal  binarysearchSortedNumbers,target         if linearVal  1             System.out.printlnLinear search   target   does not exist in the array.         else              System.out.printlnLinear search  target   is in location   linearVal          if binaryVal  1             System.out.printlnBinary search   target   does not exist in the array.         else              System.out.printlnBinary search  target   is in location   binaryVal           7. Repeat steps 5 and 6 until the user is satisfied.         System.out.printlnContinue YN         String answer  indata.next         if answerY             break                    8. Repeat steps 27 until the user is done working with different arbitrary sets of numbers.     System.out.printlnContinue with another set YN     String answer2  indata.next     if answer2Y         break       codepre  pSo technically i need it to stop when i enter N, or ask me if i want a new set when i enter Y, and then on the second loop go back to value to check on N, or start from the beginning for Y.p

Negative 25194 pSimilar issue as a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comq197109302800918this questiona, but the working answer there does not help me.p  pMy app has a grid of QFrames.  Right clicking in a frame brings up a context QMenu as a child of the QFrame.  One of the menu options creates a modal QDialog child of the menu, and displays it usingp  precodevoid ContextMenusaveAs       QPointerltMyDlggt myDlg  new MyDlg this      myDlggtsetModaltrue     myDlggtshow  codepre  pWhen the dialog OK button is clicked, the MyDlgaccept slot is activated, it does its thing, calls close, the QDialog goes away, and the app keeps running.p  pWhen the dialog Cancel button is clicked the Dialog goes away, and the app exits.p  pI have tried implementing the MyDlgreject slot, and having it call close.  In that case, the Dialog will not go away and the app remains running.p  pI have tried attaching to the reject via the UI editor, which created MyDlgonbuttonBoxreject, and had that call close.  Results in the original behavior  app exits.p  pI have tried using myDlgexec, instead of myDlgshow.  Results in the original behavior  app exits.p  pFinally, I have tried the above individually, and in concert with a hrefhttpstackoverflow.coma197120852800918this answera, but that had no effect on the results.p  pI have also read through whatever Qt forums I could google up with these terms, and they all have variations on the things Ive tried above.p  pThe code doesnt use QApplication, it uses QMainWindow.

Negative 25194 pI have an image gallery that in wrapped in a div. Rather than assign codeonclickcode events to a finite list of images I assign the codeonclickcode to the wrapper div. Image information is provided by an ajax call and I loop through the response data creating HTML which I inject into the wrapper DIV. Now each image contains attributes that I use to pass to a light boxmodal window later. Everything was fine but with adding more attributes to each image I have noticed the attributes are ordered differently when inspecting the images using IE or Firefox developer tools. The order is preserved in Chrome and older versions of IE an attribute of codecompletecompletecode is created. This of course breaks my JavaScript code. p  pThus I can no longer reply on the positioning due to the parser of the browser. I output my HTML as sop  precodeltimg srcabcSmall.jpg altSome Flowers datausernameMr Sausage databigPhotoUrlabcBig.jpg dataUserId31333205 photoUploadDate25052014gt codepre  pbut in Firefox and IE this is coming out as p  precodeltimg databigPhotoUrlabcBig.jpg datausernameMr Sausage altSome Flowers dataUserId31333205 photoUploadDate25052014 srcabcSmall.jpggt codepre  pSo my means of getting the attribute values below is now useless in IE and Firefoxp  precodeifevent.target.nodeName  IMG          this is src  event.target.attributes[0].value        this is alt  event.target.attributes[1].value        this is username  event.target.attributes[2].value        this is bigPhotoUrl  event.target.attributes[3].value        this is userId  event.target.attributes[4].value        this is photoUploadDate  event.target.attributes[5].value          now i create HTML Nodes and Elements to pass as contents of a modal window using the items above       codepre  pso I have to now loop through the codeNamedNodeMapcode of codeevent.target.attributescode however I am unsure what is the best way to create a variable that has the name of the html attribute and takes the value of the property.

Negative 25194 pImagine I have a class named codeMyValuecode with a constructor codeint valuecode. It is general purpose class, and I can put any codeintcode value to its constructor. But sometimes I need to use this class with more constraints. For example I need to force user enter only positive values. I could do a new class that inherits from codeMyValuecode, but for structs it is impossible.  p  pMaybe it is possible to achieve this behavior with attributes  p  precode pseudo code [ConstraintMin0] public MyValue MyProperty  get set  codepre  pAnd MyProperty could somehow read this attribute, and use this constraint in constructor to check valid values. But i think its not possible.p  pCan you give me some advices to achieve similar behaviorp  pEDIT It looks like PostSharp have this functionality here a hrefhttpwww.postsharp.netmodelcodecontracts relnofollowhttpwww.postsharp.netmodelcodecontractsa Properties are decorated with attributes like [EmailAddress], and then it injects IL code i think in setter which checks input value.

When I try and use the methods that are most widely described online using codeview.drawcode and codeview.getDrawingCachecode the flash elements do not get captured. I believe this has to do with software vs hardware rendering of the elements.

The thing is the time based key needs to be selected when a index pattern is being configured in Kibana.

It is working properly now.p

Negative 25194 pI changed the default RPM database to Berkeley on my embedded x86 Linux system running kernel v3.4.34 and rpm5.4.9 whereas beforehand my system was running kernel 2.6.34 and rpm5.1.9 and the default RPM database was SQLite. I started seeing reports of RPM database failures in regards to power pulls. So I was wondering if experts on this forum had any data or recommendations in this area of using Berkeley over SQLite in regards to a system that needs to be power loss tolerant p  pIn my research I have come across the following manual pages a hrefhttpdocs.oracle.comcdE1727501htmlprogrammerreferencetransappreclimit.html relnofollowBerkeley DB recoverabilityap  pI also found that Berkeley DB uses the same techniques for data integrity and failure recovery as the most popular enterprise relational systems on the market, and is able to provide the same reliability guarantees. These services, including twophase locking and writeahead logging, allow Berkeley DB to survive system failures without losing data. Recovery processing at system restart time ensures that all committed database updates are restored and available, and any interrupted work is rolled back so that it does not appear in the database.p  pIf this is correct, then the issue we are experiencing could be with the interface between the Linux filesystem ext4 and the underlying storage hardware eMMC.p  pThe eMMC spec reads that when operating in normal data reliability mode there is some risk that previously written data may be corrupted for unforeseen events such as power interruption. Having said this, I was not quite sure if this was exactly what I had been observing in my testing. Given equal conditions why would SQLite come out better in this respectp

I looked into the options codeaspectRatiocode, codecontentHeightcode, and codeheightcode but none of them seem to do what I am looking for.p  pTypically, when changing codecontentHeightcode to a new value at calendars initialization, the rows for the hours stay the same height. And a big empty row is added underneath the last hour see screenshot belowp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comTJIiO.png altfullCalendar scaling going wrongp  pOn the other hand, changing codeaspectRatiocode does not seem to have any effect at all. Even after removing codeheightcode and codecontentHeightcode from the set options. I may be missing something here.p  pFinally, I decided to look into a CSS solution. It seems like using a selector to force the rows to a specific height works. Not sure if thats the right way to go though, as the styling of events amp maybe more may go wrong as a side effect.

Negative 25194 pWe have a problem in our company with an application and would like to advise us an optimal solution, the point is that we have an application for tablets made with Flex mobile, our application can open modules in execution time downloading it from a server, these modules are opened perfectly with AIR or Android but in IOS is not possible, thats not working. Some solutions for us to have the extra functionality that provide these modules have occurred, are as follows 1. Create a library for each extra functionality of each client and import all of them in the main application project. 2. Create a unique library with the functionality of all clients and then, import it in the main application project. 3. Create as many native extensions ANE and functionalities as are required by our different customer and import them into our application. I would like to know which solution is optimal because in the future we can get 100 customers and maybe too much functionality may slow down the application. Thank you very much.p

Negative 25194 pI had to create a quick and dirty expandcollapse functionality to replicate existing behavior that did not require the use of jQuery as the existing method uses jQuery and has some conflicts that require significant debugging to resolve.p  pOriginally I had decided to use pure CSS but couldnt think of a way to make it infinitely scalable if necessary, so I opted to use a little bit of JavaScript to make the magic work.p  pI will post the code, explain it and then illustrate in a fiddlep  pstrongJavaScriptstrongp  precodeltscriptgt     function cflExpandingContente, b          e  document.getElementByIdb          ife.style.height  25px              e.style.height  25px          else              c  document.querySelector.cflExpandContent, .  b             e.style.height  e.clientHeight  c.clientHeight  px               ltscriptgt codepre  pstrongCSSstrongp  precode.expandable      overflow hidden     moztransition all 1s easeinout      mstransition all 1s easeinout       otransition all 1s easeinout  webkittransition all 1s easeinout          transition all 1s  codepre  pstrongHTMLstrongp  precodelt Begin ExpandCollapse gt ltdiv idsbb1 classexpandable styleheight 25pxgt     lta href onclickcflExpandingContentthis, sbb1 return falsegtCLICK HERE TO EXPAND gtgtltagt     ltul classcflExpandContent sbb1gt         [cflproducts]ProductName[cflproducts]     ltulgt ltdivgt lt End ExpandCollapse gt codepre  pstrongWordpress Shortcodestrongp  precodefunction getbrandproducts atts, brand  null        prods  getposts array         postsperpage gt 1,         productcat gt brand,         posttype gt product,         orderby gt title            foreach prods as prod               products . ltligtlta href . getpermalink prodgtID  . gt . prodgtposttitle . ltagtltligt              return products   addshortcode cflproducts, getbrandproducts  codepre  pSo, starting from the bottom up, the shortcode hooks into the preexisting WooCommerce database, and retrieves all products for a given brand, loops through the products and builds a list of stronglistrong elements containing links and titles.p  pThe HTML has a strongdivstrong which contains the custom shortcode tag and defines the brand parameter to be passed to the function. The strongdivstrong is set to a fixed height with the overflow set to hidden via CSS.p  pWhats shown is a link with an onclick event that triggers a JavaScript placed in the footer of the theme.p  pThe script takes two parameters, the current element that is triggering the function call strongthisstrong and the unique element identifier ID. This is done because there is a grid of 6 such blocks, and I wanted the code to be as reusable as possible.p  pTaking the script parameters, it first gets the strongdivstrong element being manipulated, then does a check if the styleheight 25px isnt 25px, it sets it to 25px this is the collapse mechanism. However if the element height IS 25px ie, its closed it gets the supposed to anyway full height value of the element, including the hidden content.p  pWhat happens is when the element height is set to a fixed amount, the CSS transition code kicks in and shows a smooth openclose animation.p  pHere is the Fiddle with dummy content to illustrate different heights a hrefhttpsjsfiddle.net5uzxLd5p8 relnofollowhttpsjsfiddle.net5uzxLd5p8ap  pThe code technically works but not to my satisfaction.

Ie, if sbb2 is clicked, it still looks for and grabs sbb1s .cflExpandContent UL.p  pIf I instead hardcode the element height to be auto it correctly opens whichever element to the proper height, but breaks the CSS transition.p  pIs there any way around thisp  pThanks in advancep

Negative 25194 pI am developing a realtime application using EventMachine. Two clients, codeAcode and codeBcode, connect to an EventMachine server over standard TCP, or via WebSocket with emwebsocket. p  pEvery time data goes through EventMachine, code execution takes a 95ms hit. When codeAcode talks to the server, there is a 95ms delay. When codeAcode talks to codeBcode, then there is a 190ms delay.p  pIf many requests occur in rapid succession, the delay disappears, except for the final request in the sequence. So, if I send 10 rapid requests, Ill get 9 responses after about 5ms each, but the 10th response will take 95ms again.p  pIve deduced that this has something to do with a hrefhttpwww.rubydoc.infogithubeventmachineeventmachineEventMachine.setquantum relnofollowEventMachine.setquantuma. From the docsp  blockquote   pMethod EventMachine.setquantump      pFor advanced users. This function sets the default timer granularity,   which by default is strongslightly smaller than 100 millisecondsstrong. Call this   function to set a higher or lower granularity. The function affects   the behavior of addtimer and addperiodictimer. Most applications   will not need to call this function.p      pAvoid setting the quantum to very low values because that may reduce   performance under some extreme conditions. We recommend that you not   use values lower than 10.p blockquote  pWell, that explains where the 95ms came from. Sure enough, the delays change by calling codeEventMachine.setquantumcode, but I am wary of tweaking this value because of the warning in the documentation.p  pstrongWhat is codesetquantumcode actually doingstrong I cant find any documentation or explanation about what the quantum variable means.p  pstrongWhat can I do to reduce these delaysstrong Id like to understand the potential repercussions of decreasing the quantum to, say, 10ms. p  pstrongIs EventMachine even the right choicestrong Im essentially using it as a glorified TCP connection. Maybe I should just stick to raw sockets for interprocess communication, and find a WebSocket server gem that doesnt use EventMachine.p

Negative 25194 pI wrote a script which tends to be long about 2000 lines and which actually contains a collection of functions. When I run the script I select a function through a command line argument and run this specific function. This script is actually a set of tools.p  pI noted that it takes some times before the script really start maybe due to module importations or python stuffs. Thus I wonder what is the best thing to do to make it quicker  Does it will be quicker if all the functions were in a separate module file which will be precompiled by python .pyc format p

Negative 25194 pIO got a real weird problem in my asp classic page. I am generating a schedule of days off for employees. When I tested it it seemed to work fine. Though with another option I could go a week back and forth and when I went 3 weeks back the loop keeps getting looping on one single record. p  pSo I wanted to check where the problem was by doing a count on the recordset after the SQL execution.p  pFor some reason though, the do while loop keeps looping. I did a print count in the do while to see how many records it finds and now it is already on 508 000  p  pSo in my tsql server 2012 I did the EXACT same query and here it only results in 953 records...  p  pSo obviously tghere goes something wrong in the loop. p  pHere is the code I am usingp  precodestrSQL  SELECT  FROM [qrySnipperKalenderB] WHERE [snipperdag] gt amp szStart amp AND [snipperdag]lt amp szEnd amp ORDER BY [FunctieGroep], [Relatienaam], [Datum] ASC       response.writestrSQL amp ltbrgt ltbrgt      set rstconsql.executestrSQL     CountCheck  0       Do until rst.EOF or rst.BOF         response.writeCount is  amp CountCheck amp ltbrgt          CountCheck  CountCheck  1     Loop      response.writeRST count       amp CountCheck     response.end codepre  pThe response.end and response.write RST count never get hit, it just keeps looping making the page very slow. p  pThe response.write SQL results in codeSELECT  FROM [qrySnipperKalenderB] WHERE [snipperdag] gt 15281 AND [snipperdag]lt 15355 ORDER BY [FunctieGroep], [Relatienaam], [Datum] ASCcodep  pWhen I run this query in the SQL server it results in 953 records like it should. p  pSo the question is, why is this loop broken  keeps it running p  pI already tried to modify the loop with the rst.BOF first I only had the EOF but this doesnt have any effect. I also tried to use an IF condition inside the loop that if it hits EOF then exit the loop, but this also doesnt work.p

Negative 25194 pI am working on a form that allows the user to edit, add, and remove committees. In the edit section, I wrote php code that allows the user to select from a drop down populated by a csv the name of the committee and then, when a first submit is clicked, information about that committee automatically displays in the fields of the form.p  pThe problem is that I need cgi action linked to a second submit button at the end of the form, so that once it is clicked, all of the information will be updated. This is the button that actually needs to send in the data. The previous submit button was so the php could get the value of the selected committee and the info about it. The phpautofill feature is to hopefully make life easier for the user. The php is very intertwined with the html so having a separate file would be tricky.p  pMy question can I have two submit buttons in one form if the form has actionsomething.cgi and only the second button is supposed to do the action p

Negative 25194 pI have a tool that displays some lines and other elements using RaphaelJS.  Recently, I started to have problems with the version I was using 2.1.2 so I upgraded to version 2.1.4.  That version is not an official release yet, but it fixed the issues I was having.p  pHowever, it introduced one issue that Im struggling to resolve.  I use paper.setSize to allow the user to zoom in to parts of the canvas.  Previously, in 2.1.2, this would affect the strokewidth of all the elements.  The default stroke width for everything was 1, but when using paper.setSize the stroke width would be scaled appropriately.p  pHowever, in versions 2.1.3 and 2.1.4, the strokewidth is no longer scaled.  It remains 1 no matter what size the paper is set to.  This makes the lines very faint when zoomed out, making it impossible to discern colors.p  pAny suggestions  Is there something else I need to do in version 2.1.3  Thanksp

Negative 25194 pAccording to a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions31729594howcanibinddatacontexttoagenericviewmodelinxamlthis questiona and the very useful answers from nice guys, I found there is no support for generic types in codeXAMLcode. We are not allowed to instantiate a generic view model for our user controls. But, according to this fact I decided to bring up another questionsp  ol liWhy should we create a generic view model when we can not use it in a view we have to define concrete classes for each type so whats the benefit of having a generic class at all At first I tried generic View Model because I thought it would be possible to customize Views according to the  typed arguments. And work with content of the codeWPFcode components with typed methods.li liPeople suggest me to create a base generic view model and several child concrete classes for each Type. In this scenario what could be usage of that generic class As far as I know a View Model is a concept that is useful for binding to a Data context. So if there is no means to access those typed arguments in the codeDataContextcode why should I use a generic View Model, Since there is no other usage for a View Model because all of the logic and business of the application is in the center of the Model. And View Model only prepares presentation of the data inside Model for View. li liWhy Microsoft did not provide this functionality in codeXAMLcode Is there any restriction for developing such a feature in codeWPFcode Or something like this, is actually a logical contradiction with the nature of the codeMVVMcodeli ol

Negative 25194 pIt used to be that ARM processors were unable to properly handle unaligned memory access ARMv5 and below. Something like codeu32 var32  u32ptrcode would just fail raise exception if codeptrcode was not properly aligned on 4bytes.p  pWriting such a statement would work fine for x86x64 though, since these CPU have always handled such situation very efficiently. But according to C standard, this is not a proper way to write it. codeu32code is apparently equivalent to a structure of 4 bytes which emmustem be aligned on 4 bytes.p  pA proper way to achieve the same result while keeping the orthodoxy correctness emandem ensuring full compatibility with any cpu is  p  precodeu32 read32const void ptr        u32 result      memcpyampresult, ptr, 4      return result   codepre  pThis one is correct, will generate proper code for any cpu able or not to read at unaligned positions. Even better, on x86x64, its properly optimized to a single read operation, hence has the same performance as the first statement. Its portable, safe, and fast. Who can ask more p  pWell, problem is, on ARM, we are not so lucky.p  pWriting the codememcpycode version is indeed safe, but seems to result in systematic cautious operations, which are very slow for ARMv6 and ARMv7 basically, any smartphone.p  pIn a performance oriented application which heavily relies on read operations, the difference between the 1st and 2nd version could be measured  it stands at  strong 5xstrong at codegcc O2code settings. This is way too much to be ignored.p  pTrying to find a way to use ARMv6v7 capabilities, Ive looked for guidance on a few example codes around. Unfortunatley, they seem to select the first statement direct codeu32code access, which is not supposed to be correct.p  pThats not all  new GCC versions are now trying to implement autovectorization. On x64, that means SSEAVX, on ARMv7 that means NEON. ARMv7 also supports some new Load Multiple LDM and Store Multiple STM opcodes, which emrequireem pointer to be aligned.p  pWhat does that mean  Well, the compiler is free to use these advanced instructions, even if they were not specifically called from the C code no intrinsic. To take such decision, it uses the fact the an codeu32 pointercode is supposed to be aligned on 4 bytes. If its not, then all bets are off  undefined behavior, crashes.p  pWhat that means is that even on CPU which support unaligned memory access, its now dangerous to use direct codeu32code access, as it can lead to buggy code generation at high optimization settings codeO3code.p  pSo now, this is a dilemna  how to access the native performance of ARMv6v7 on unaligned memory access emwithoutem writing the incorrect version codeu32code access p  pPS  Ive also tried codepackedcode instructions, and from a performance perspective, they seem to work exactly the same as the codememcpycode method.p  pem[Edit] em Thanks for the excellent elements received so far.p  pLooking at the generated assembly, I could confirm Notlikethat finding that codememcpycode version does indeed generate proper codeldrcode opcode unaligned load. However, I also found that the generated assembly uselessly invokes codestrcode command. So the complete operation is now an unaligned load, an aligned store, and then a final aligned load. Thats a lot more work than necessary.p  pAnswering haneefmubarak, yes the code is properly inlined. And no, codememcpycode is very far from providing the best possible speed, since forcing the code to accept direct codeu32code access translates into huge performance gains. So some better possibility must exist.p  pA big thank to artlessnoise. The link to godbolt service is unvaluable. Ive never been able to see so clearly the equivalence between a C source code and its assembly representation. This is highly inspiring.p  pI completed one of artless examples, and it gives the following p  precodeinclude ltstdlib.hgt include ltmemory.hgt typedef unsigned int u32  u32 reada32const void ptr  return const u32 ptr   u32 readu32const void ptr        u32 result      memcpyampresult, ptr, 4      return result   codepre  ponce compiled using ARM GCC 4.8.2 at O3 or O2 p  precodereada32void const     ldr r0, [r0]     bx  lr readu32void const     ldr r0, [r0]     unaligned     sub sp, sp, 8     str r0, [sp, 4]     unaligned     ldr r0, [sp, 4]     add sp, sp, 8     bx  lr codepre  pQuite telling ....p

I tried to get around the issue by ignoring Wicket, but its so tightly coupled to our data that I cant find a way around it without rewriting tons of existing code. p  pIs there a way that I can either tell Wicket that it needs to manage this endpoint, or a way that I can get my application context once Im inside my REST servicep  pHeres some relevant code.p  precodePOST Pathgeneratenum Producestextplain RolesAllowed         AuthorizeRole.ROLE  public Response generatePathParamnum String num throws Exception      Response response     Type incomingType  getTypereportBn      ifincomingType.equalsType.type          response  Response.statusResponse.Status.BADREQUEST.entityCould not process request.build         return response           SomeObject newObj  new SomeObjectnum      This will cause the error, but its actually      getting called later, this is just to show why its thrown.

Negative 25194 pI have been working on a Python 2.7 script that accesses a Reddit account, collects all of the saved submissions, and writes them to a .xlsx workbook. Saved comments do not contain the same attributes as the submissions and throw an exception when the for loop encounters them. The program runs a tryexcept clause to catch any comments and writes all valid saved submissions to the workbook. While the program does write submissions in to the workbook properly, it only does so only for submissions that were saved before the earliest saved comment. I know that it is doing this because of the continue statement I use when an exception is encountered. However, I have tried running pass in place of the continue statement and it performs vice versa it will only write submissions to the workbook that were saved after the most recently saved comment. After researching, it seems as though that the tryexcept statement is required if I am to bypass the comments, but I am left clueless at this point. Here is a link to the code as it currently stands on BitBucketp  pa hrefhttpsbitbucket.orgjaredelliottredditsavedorgsrc5b3abc716374f4b0a042726f83716758a67a6273redditsavedorg.pyatmaster relnofollowhttpsbitbucket.orgjaredelliottredditsavedorgsrc5b3abc716374f4b0a042726f83716758a67a6273redditsavedorg.pyatmasterap  pP.S.

Negative 25194 pIn my application, I have a tab bar architecture.  When a tab button is tapped, a transition to a viewcontroller that has an iAd banner view at the bottom, and a containerview stretching from the top of the view to the top of the banner.

Negative 25194 pI am rewriting a web application in VS 2012 Pro.  The old application was done in VS 2008 and used several Typed DataSets for db interaction.  I have copied the typed dataset files .xsd, .cs, .xsc, .xss, .Designer.cs, etc from the old project to the new.  The new web app solution is comprised of 5 projects, all targeting .NET Framework 3.5. I am using a different SQL Server instance my local test db server than the original, but the db itself was restored from a backup of the production db.  Also, the prod db is SQL Server 2008 Express, my local is SQL Server 2012 Express.p  pI can, with no issues, use the existing typed datasets to retrieve and save data hitting my test db.  And btw, the old app used these DataConnection files .cs and .resx, which I also copied into the new web application to enable usage of the typed datasets.  I did need to change the connection strings of course.p  pThe trouble I am having is that I have added new columns to one of the tables in my test db, but I am unable to update the Typed DataSets to make them aware of the new columns.  p  pI am new to Typed DataSets, and after a couple days research I have learned that you would normally create a data connection thru server explorer then drag tables from your db onto a Typed DataSet surface.  Also, I have read that you can refresh or configure the Typed DataSet to make it aware of new columns.  I am unable to do that with these existing copied in datasets when I doubleclick on an .xsd, and rightclick, the menu that pops up has configure disabled.p  pI have even created a new solution, setup all of my projects, and recreated from scratch the data connection and Typed DataSets, but lots of other things break.p  pIn my last working solution, I added a data connection in server explorer to my local test SQL Server db, but it did not help, which may be due to the fact that it is not the same db server as what was used when the original Typed DataSets were created  To validate this idea I looked thru all of the files for one of the Typed DataSets but found nothing that points to a data connection, so I am unsure if that is in fact an issue.p  pSo, my question is, how can I update an existing Typed DataSet that I copied into a new project  It is interesting that I can used them as is, but cannot update them.  My guess is that there is a disconnect between the Typed DataSets and the db itselfp  pThxp

Negative 25194 pIve tried many solutions I can found on the stackoverflow and laracast. But my problem is slightly different, I get this TokenMismatchException in VerifyCSrfToken.php exception, but strongonce I refresh the page, this error is gonestrong and Im able to submit the form properly. This has been happening every time, I fill the form, I get the exception and when I refresh, the error is gone. Im using LaravelCollective for form generation. Ive tried clearing all 3 types of cache. Ive also tried adding the   line manually, but this doesnt do any good, it actually led to same line twice in code as HTML generator has added this line itself, I removed it, still nothing is working.
