Positive 869 pI am trying to build a charting application using svg and d3 for desktop now, but might start supporting mobile later. The chart has multiple components like comments which can be rich text and images at various zindex embedded into the application.p  pI wanted to keep the chart pure svg, so that I might not get inconsistencies when implementing a feature in the future because part of it is svg and part of it is HTML foreign object.p  pI was compelled to use foreign object when I had to display a rich text comment, and as I progress there are places where using foreign object would make it a lot less painful implementation tables, tooltips.

Negative 869 pThe data model for my Core Data documentbased app 10.5 only is in a framework, so automatic schema upgrades using a Core Data mapping model dont appear to work. It appears that the Core Data machinery doesnt find the appropriate data models or mapping model when they are not in the apps main bundle. So, instead of using the automatic migration, Im running a migration manually in codeconfigurePersistentStoreCoordinatorForURLofType...code in my codeNSPersistenDocumentcode subclass code below. I migrate the persistent store to a temporary file and then overwrite the existing file if the migration succeeds. The document then presents an error with the message This documents file has been changed by another application since you opened or saved it. when I try to save. As others on this list have pointed out, this is due to my modification of the documents file behind its back. I tried updating the documents file modification date, as shown below, but I then get an error dialog with the message The location of the document test.ovproj cannot be determined. when I try to save.

Negative 869 pOur database architecture consists of two Sql Server 2005 servers each with an instance of the same database structure one for all reads, and one for all writes.  We use transactional replication to keep the read database uptodate.p  pThe two servers are very highspec indeed the write server has 32GB of RAM, and are connected via a fibre network.p  pWhen deciding upon this architecture we were led to believe that the latency for data to be replicated to the read server would be in the order of a few milliseconds depending on load, obviously.  In practice we are seeing latency of around 25 seconds in even the simplest of cases, which is unsatisfactory.  By a simplest case, I mean updating a single value in a single row in a single table on the write db and seeing how long it takes to observe the new value in the read database.p  pWhat factors should we be looking at to achieve latency below 1 second  Is this even achievablep  pAlternatively, is there a different mode of replication we should consider  What is the best practice for the locations of the data and log filesp  pstrongEditstrongp  pThanks to all for the advice and insight  I believe that the latency periods we are experiencing emareem normal we were misled by our db hosting company as to what latency times to expect  p  pWere using the technique described near the bottom of a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenusmagazinecc500561.aspxthis MSDN articlea under the heading scaling databases, and wed failed to deal properly with this warningp  blockquote   pThe consequence of creating such specialized databases is latency a write is now going to take time to be distributed to the reader databases.

This is supposed to enable the server to control its own URI space and reduce coupling with the client.p  pWhen a client for the service sends a successful request to create a new resource, the service responds 201 CREATED and gives the URI at which the new resource can be accessed in the Location header field.p  pShould a client be allowed to store this URI to enable direct access to the resource in the future and if so for how long If URIs are cached by the client, this seems to be setting up a situation in which every time the server changes its URI layout, it will need to make sure a permanent redirect gets served when old URIs are accessed. Otherwise the client breaks. Over several years, this system of redirects could get out of hand.p  pThis situation would not appear to have given the server much more control over its URI space than a RESTRPC hybrid approach using URI templates.p  pTheres a lot of information available about caching representations, but what about caching URIs in hypertextdriven RESTful systemsp

Negative 869 pMy question is concerning SQL connection status, load, etc. based on the following codep  precodepublic IEnumberableltMyTypegt GetMyTypeObjects    string cmdTxt  select  from MyObjectTable    usingSqlConnection conn  new SqlConnectionconnString        usingSqlCommand cmd  new SqlCommandcmdTxt, conn            conn.Open       usingSqlDataReader reader  cmd.ExecuteReader                 whilereader.Read                       yield return Mapper.MapToltMyTypegtreader                             yield break  codepre  pI can see this possibly being a problem if there are many processes running similar code with long execution times between iterations of the IEnumerable object, because the connections will be open longer, etc. However, it also seems plausible that this will reduce the CPU usage on the SQL server because it only returns data when the IEnumerable object is used. It also lowers memory usage on the client because the client only has to load one instance of MyType while it works rather than loading all occurrences of MyType by iterating through the entire DataReader and returning a List or something.p  ul lipAre there any instances you can think of where you would not want to use IEnumerable in this manner, or any instances you think it fits perfectlypli lipWhat kind of load does this put on the SQL serverpli lipIs this something you would use in your own code barring any mention of NHibernate, Subsonic, etcpli     ul

Negative 869 pWe are using Wpf Combobox to allow the user to do the following things 1 select items by typing in the first few characters 2 auto complete the entry by filtering the list 3 suggesting the first item to match the letters typed as the selected itemp  pThe challenge is handling the scenario when the user enters characters that are NOT in the list.  This should indicate that the user has either made a mistake OR wants to enter a new item.br The Combobox is bound to custom types and they have validation rules associated with the property being populated with the selection.  We cannot figure out how to identify when the user has typed in an entry NOT IN THE LIST and set the bound property to an invalid value that will trigger the validation.p  pWhen a user enters a string of characters that do not represent an item in the list, the selecteditem becomes null.  Since the selecteditem is null, the property path bound to the forms datacontext object cannot be identified by WPF and so the binding fails.  The business object then retains whatever previous value was set and does not get a new value.p

Negative 869 pEven though Ive been using mootools for a while now, I havent really gotten into playing with the natives yet. Currently Im trying to extend events by adding a custom addEvent method beside the original. I did that using the following codecopied from mootools corep  precodeNative.implement[Element, Window, Document],      addMyEventfunction code here   codepre  pNow the problem is that I cant seem to figure out, how to properly overwrite the existing codefireEventcode method in a way that I can still call the orignal method after executing my own logic.p  pI could probably get the desired results with some ugly hacks but Id prefer learning the elegant way p  hr  pUpdate Tried a couple of ugly hacks. None of them worked. Either I dont understand closures or Im tweaking the wrong place. I tried saving codeElement.fireEventcode to a temporary variablewith and without using closures, which I would then call from the overwritten fireEvent functionoverwritten using codeNative.implementcode  the same as above. The result is an endless loop with codefireEventcode calling itself over and over again.p  pUpdate 2 I followed the execution using firebug and it lead me to codeNative.genericizecode, which seems to act as a kind of proxy for the methods of native classes. So instead of referencing the actual fireEvent method, I referenced the proxy and that caused the infinite loop. Google didnt find any useful documentation about this and Im a little wary about poking around under the hood when I dont completely understand how it works, so any help is much appreciated.p  hr  pUpdate 3  Original problem solved As I replied to Dimitars comment below, I managed to solve the original problem by myself. I was trying to make a method for adding events that destroy themselves after a certain amount of executions. Although the original problem is solved, my question about extending natives remain.p  pHeres the finished codep  precodeNative.implement[Element, Window, Document],  addVolatileEventfunctiontype,fn,counter,internal     ifcounter         counter1     var volatileFnfunction         fn.runarguments         counter1         ifcounterlt1                      this.removeEventtype,volatileFn                   this.addEventtype,volatileFn,internal   codepre  pis the name right Thats the best I could come up with my limited vocabulary.p

Negative 869 pFolks I am implementing a file based queue a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions3154034implementingafilebasedqueuesee my earlier questiona using sqlite. I have the following threads running in backgroundp  ol lithread1 to empty out a memory structure into the queue table an insert into queue table.li lithread1 to read and process the queue table runs every 5 to 10 secondsli lithread3  runs very infrequently and purges old data that is no longer needed from the queue table and also runs vacuum so the size of the database file remains small.li ol  pNow the behavior that I would like is for each thread to get whatever lock it needs waiting with a timeout if possible and then completing the transaction. It is ok if threads do not run concurrently  what is important is that the transaction once begins does not fail due to locking errors such as database is locked.p  pI looked at the a hrefhttpwww.sqlite.orglangtransaction.html relnofollowtransaction documentationa but there does not seem to be a timeout facility I am using JDBC. Can the timeout be set to a large quantity in the connectionp  pOne solution untried I can think of is to have a connection pool of max 1 connection. Thus only one thread can connect at a time and so we should not see any locking errors. Are there better waysp  pThanxp

Negative 869 pIt is easy to see that G is between A and Z, but if I have a user enter a range of serial numbers from code56AAA7105A25code to code56AAA71064D6code, how can I determine if another serial number or  range falls between the two serial numbers specified before.  In order for me to know if it falls between them, wouldnt I need to know how it rolls over.  The problem I am facing is that according to code c in this case, one value would be considered greater than and less than the two values I specified, but according to the user, the value they enter is actually outside the range.  How do I handle scenarios like thisp
Negative 869 pI have a couple activities in my app that I would like to utilize shared preferences.  Initially, I created a method in each activity to utilize SharedPreferences, which worked fine.  However, since there are multiple activities that use the same data, Im basically tucking similar methods in multiple places.  So it seemed like it made more sense to create a class specifically for the purpose of handling all these methods.p  pUnfortunately, I dont understand how to do it properly.p  pThis wont compile, because it says getSharedPreferences is undefined for the type AppPrefs.p  precodepublic class AppPrefs   public void foo    SharedPreferences settings  getSharedPreferencesMyAppPrefs, 0     codepre  pFinally, I thought, maybe since SharedPreferences is an interface I could do this, but then Id have to implement the inherited methods.  I have no reason to Override any of those methods, so there is no reason to do this either.p  precodepublic class AppPrefs implements SharedPreferences   public void foo    SharedPreferences settings  getSharedPreferencesMyAppPrefs, 0     codepre  pWhat makes sense to do here  Is there a concept am I missing  Could anyone elaborate and explain  Thanks.p

Negative 869 pId really appreciate a hand getting my fixedheader table scrolling in IE7.p  pIn IE7, my tall data table is forcing its containing DIV to expand vertically, and preventing that DIVs scrollbar from showing.

My table actually contains tabular data, typically 10 columns and 200 rows, so a table is semantically accurate. Theres actually more content around this table of course.p  pId prefer not to use javascript for dynamic dimensions, unless it is so simple that its bulletproof, since I always end up with stupid defects oh, yeah, I didnt think to reevaluate size when you hover over hyperlinks and the line height changes, etc..p  pThank you, Shannonp

This dictionary is a list of all the database fields that can be used in adhoc records queries in the horrible legacy application.  Each record holds the table and column where an item can be found,  unique identfying friendly name, a key for use in a global value lookup table, and a flag that determines how those lookup values are pulled, and a text column that defines SQL to run to obtain lookup data if the flag value is set appropriately.  The table name is [dictionary] see below for table structure.p  pThe flag can have one of four valuesp  ul liFREEFORMli liSTANDARDli liSYSTEMli liDYNAMICli ul  pIf the flag is set to FREEFORM, than the end user can enter any value they want.

I wish I could, as this is only one of many things that makes my hair gray when it comes to this application.  So...p  pMy main question, I guess, is if it is possible to map these in such a way with NHibernate so that when I grab a dictionary item, its lookup values are filled in for me  If it is possible, how  I know that if all of the lookups were done in the same way, I could, but I dont even know if it is possible to map based on externally obtained queries.p  pI hope this makes sense, as it took me a while to wrap my brain around it.p  pstrongEDITstrong Here are some examples of what I am trying to accomplish.p  pWe have the following records in the [dictionary] tablep  precodetoken, name     , tablename, columnname, lookupkey, lookuptype, querytext 1    , gender   , customer  , gender     , gender    , STANDARD   , NULL 2    , addrst  , customer  , addrst    , state     , SYSTEM     , NULL 3    , accttype, custaccts, typecode  , accttype , DYNAMIC    , select typecode, descr from accttypes where active  1 codepre  pSo, in the legacy application, when they get pulled up, here is the SQL that is executed to pull up the lookup values.p  pGenderp  precodeselect lookupvalue,        lookupdescription from   lookupvalues union all select lookupvalue,        lookupdescription from   lookupvalues where  fyyeartoken  P1 codepre  pAddress Statep  precodeselect statecode,        statename from   state codepre  pAccount Typep  precodeselect typecode,        descr from   accttypes where  active  1 codepre

Negative 869 pI want to implement and understand the concept of marshalling over my own rpc mechanism toy really. While I get the idea behind endianness, i am not sure how to handle 32bit and 16 bit ints. So the problem is that machine A has int represented at 32 bit and it wants to call a function int fooint x over an rpc call however the server where this int is represented is 16 bit. Sending just the lower 16 bits would loose information and is not desirable. p  pI know IDLs work to solve this problem. But in this case lets say I use an IDL that defines int to be 32 bit. While this case works for my scenario, in the case of machine A with 16 bit int, 2 bytes will always be wasted when transmitting over the network. p  pIf we flip the IDL to be 16bit, then the user has to manually split its local int and do something fancy, completely breaking the transparency of an RPC. p  pSo what is the right way used in actual implementationsp  pthanks. p

Negative 869 pIm trying to figure out the best way to check whether a particular string can be created by combining other strings that I have in an array. The other strings can be any length, including one character. Furthermore, the characters in the other strings can be reordered.p  pSo if we were looking for the word dodge and our array of strings was code[god,house,d,e,cat,c,r,jump]code, we would have a match, since we could combine the letters in god,d, and e to create dodge.p  pIf the array contained dot instead of d, we would not have a match, since we have to use all the characters in each of the words we recombine wed have to use o and t as well.p  pI would also like to know which words were used to create the specified word, so if there is a match I want the function to return the array indexes of the words that were recombined to create the specified word. For the dodge example above it would return [0,2,3].p
Negative 869 pIm working in ASP.NET 4.0, and Ive got a large web form which represents a single business entity.  A user can upload multiple images associated with the entity.  The entity is created and assigned a GUID upon submitting the form.  The files will be stored to a file system.    p  pThe problem is that we have to name the files after the GUID that is assigned to the entity after it is inserted to the database.  So before the submit button is clicked, we will have several image files floating around in limbo.   p  pThere are obvious answers to this question  you save the images to the file system and then when the business entity is created, you rename those files.  However, I believe that there must be very strong patterns and several key details that would make for a very robust system.  Whats best practice for this scenario  p

Negative 869 pI think Im experiencing a threadding issue with the Django classbased views I have written.p  pAfter launching the application, the UpdateView functions fine until CreateView is calledvisited. Then subsequent UpdateViews populate the code field with the value generated in the getinitial method of CreateView.p  pThe problem only shows itself on the web server, and not when using the development runserver command.p  pE.g. if an instance of MyObject has a code of 123, then visiting the UpdateView shows the code in the form as 123. After visiting a page which calls CreateView, a new code is generated by getinitial, say 456. From then on, visiting any url which calls UpdateView shows 456 in the form instead of the instances actual code.p  pSample myproject.app.views.myobject view classesp  precodefrom django.contrib.auth.decorators import permissionrequired from django.utils.decorators import methoddecorator from django.views import generic from myproject.app.forms import MyObjectForm from myproject.app.models import MyObject   class EditMixingeneric.base.View     formclass  MyObjectForm      def getsuccessurlself         return self.object.getabsoluteurl      def formvalidself, form         self.object  form.savecommitFalse         if not self.object.pk             self.object.createdby  self.request.user         self.object.updatedby  self.request.user         self.object.save         messages.successself.request, Object saved.         return HttpResponseRedirectself.getsuccessurl   class CreateViewEditMixin, generic.edit.CreateView     model  MyObject      methoddecoratorpermissionrequiredapp.addmyobject     def dispatchself, args, kwargs         return superCreateView, self.dispatchargs, kwargs      def getinitialself         initial  superCreateView, self.getinitial         TODO proper autogeneration of code         myobject  MyObject.objects.orderbycode[0]         code  intmyobject.code  1         initial.updatecode strcode         return initial   class UpdateViewEditMixin, generic.edit.UpdateView     methoddecoratorpermissionrequiredapp.changemyobject     def dispatchself, args, kwargs         return superUpdateView, self.dispatchargs, kwargs      def getquerysetself         return MyObject.objects.filtercreatedbyself.request.user codepre  pUrl Patternsp  precodefrom myproject.app.views import myobjects   urlpatterns  patterns,     urlr, myobjects.ListView.asview, namemyobjectlist,     urlrPltpkgt[d], myobjects.DetailView.asview,         namemyobjectdetail,     urlrPltpkgt[d]edit, myobjects.UpdateView.asview,         namemyobjectedit,     urlrnew, myobjects.CreateView.asview,         namemyobjectnew,  codepre  pCan anyone help explain where I might be causing the threadding issue, and the best practice to avoid thisp

This seems necessary if XMLconfiguration is taken.p  pWhat do you think are the advantages and disadvantages of routes defined in an xmlfile When to use xmlfiles for definition of routes and when to use Java DSLp

Negative 869 pIm working on various C COM DirectShow filters called from C clients via COM interop. Theres little use of C exceptions in the code. The main exception is operator new which can throw badalloc exceptions.p  pIs there a clean way of handling badalloc exceptions in a way which can be caught by the C client p  pCould a new handler throw some an SEH exception that could be caught by COM interop clients p  pOr would it be better to link with the backwardlycompatible nonthrowing version of new in Visual Studio libraries and check every allocationp  pOne tedious alternative is to write a trycatch for hundreds of COM entry points which doesnt seem worthwhile since badalloc exceptions are rarely recoverable.p  pThe DirectShow base classes generally check for null returns from operator new as they seem to have been written for earlier versions of Visual C that didnt throw badalloc exceptions.p

Negative 869 pIn Delphi XE2 LiveBindings, I need to bind a VCL control of any type to a property of any type on an arbitrary noncomponent object.  I can do this unidirectionally.

The second button never seems to write the value back to the person1.PersonName property.  p  pIve experimented with the notification code, the binding direction, binding types, expressions, SourceMember, etc.  Sometimes I get runtime errors in the bindexpression configuration, the rest of the time the binding is simply unidirectional.p  pI expect to click the second button and see the contents of Edit1.Text written to person1.PersonName.  p  pIf I have to do this all from code, Ill consider it and such examples are welcome, but I really want to do it through the designer if possible.p  pNote that I am not interested in binding between two controls.  p  pNote too that I have already downloaded and inspected the LiveBinding sample projects, and didnt find any that do this.  If this is wrong, please be specific when pointing it out.  I have also read the DocWiki.  It does not cover bidirectional binding except using the emDBem LiveBinding controls.  I am not using the emDBem LiveBinding controls nor am I using a DataSet.  So unless you can explain to me why I should use them, I wont be needing any information about those controls.p

Negative 869 pIt seems that codeCListCtrlcode doesnt send mouse up events unless there is a double click.p  pIve attempted sending the missing message from the mouse down handlers to compensate but that causes other undesirable behavior. Then I thought I could send the message within the mouse move handler to be a bit more accurate by checking state. However these are horrible hacks and apart from being ugly they may not work properly for every possible implementation of derived controls.p  pIf anyone knows why mouse up events are not received Id be curious. More importantly stronghow do I get the codeCListCtrlcode using the codeLVSOWNERDATAcode style to send mouse up messages like every other controlstrongp  pEDIT I am aware of codeLVNBEGINDRAGcode, codeLVNBEGINRDRAGcode, etc however in order to use these I would need to prevent codeWMLBUTTONDOWNcode, codeWMRBUTTONDOWNcode, and codeWMMOUSEMOVEcode from going to the parent window or codeDragDropManagercode hooked into codeCWinAppExcodecodeCMDIFrameWndExcode so I could make a special oneoff case for this control to work with the existing system.p  pThis is because I have a central drag and drop manager which can notify various types of controls when to begin a drag operation, when to end, cancel, change animation, pass display objects for source and target in custom messages, etc. It needs to be flexible enough to have differing way of initiating as well as differing actions depending on the control, the input, the type of items selected or targeted, differing control types including 3D, or even different applications, etc.p

If its not then arrList1 will have the chosen element and arrayList2 will have the element its comparing itself to. I am currently struggling to do this, so I was wondering if anyone can help Thanksp  precodepublic static ArrayListltIntegergt arrList1  new ArrayListltIntegergt public static ArrayListltIntegergt arrList2  new ArrayListltIntegergt ...         public static void insertSortint[] A       forint i  1 i lt A.length i         int value  A[i]         int j  i  1         whilej gt 0 ampamp A[j] gt value           A[j  1]  A[j]           j  j  1                  A[j  1]  value             codepre  pEDIT For example If my array had the numbers 1,3,2,4,6,5 then when comparing, this is how I want my two array lists to lookp  precode       arrList1    arrList2 1        1           1 2        3           3 3        2           3 As 2 goes before 3 then it must be compared to 3 4        4           4 5        6           6 6        5           6 As 5 is lower then 6 then it must be compared to 6 codepre  pSorted array 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6p  pAs you can see, arrList1 is basically the order of the input array whilst arrList2 is the element it compares to if its not in correct position. If its in correct position then arrList 2 will be same value.p
Negative 869 pI have a page that displays XML info in a table. The XML files are server side and Im using PHP to get the file names and data using a drop down box. JSON is used to put the names in the dropdown and DOM to send the XML across. That works fine in all browsers. p  pThere is an issue with my adding entries feature. When I add an entry in Chrome or Firefox it shows up the next time that table is selected. It doesnt work in IE9 though.

Negative 869 pI have a web application that has a phase listener. When the phase listener runs, it does a few things with the session map. Randomly usually not the firs request, but more frequently when requests are issued quickly I am getting a null pointer exception from SessionMap.put. After a bit of digging it appeared that when SessionMap.put was getting the session, it was getting back a null pointer even though it calls getSessiontrue. So I did a bit of debugging and discovered that indeed getSession and getRequestedSessionId are both returning null when invoked. However, if you check the cookies in the request request.getCookies the JSESSIONID cookie is included in the request and has the correct session. There doesnt seem to be rhyme or reason as to why the session and the requested session id some times comes back normal and sometimes comes back null. The only other piece of information that might be relevant here is that the JSF pages are living within the same application that some older JSPServlets are living in.p  pIve looked around online and others have said setting the cookie path to  has solved similar issues for them, but it doesnt appear to solve the issue here.p

Negative 869 pI have a workbook with several comboboxes and listboxes and a lot of vba written around them. Ive used the same code in the WorkbookOpen procedure to format them for weeks, without any major trouble. p  pLast night I remoteddesktopped in to my work computer for the 2nd time ever to edit some other parts of the code nothing that touched the box properties at all. At one point after a while, the formatting of all the boxes, list and combo, went crazy. The right side scroll bars on the list boxes got huge, and huge scroll bars appeared at the bottom of them too. And the Dropdown button on the comboboxes got huge tooas wide as the box just about. p  pI closed and reopened Excel, and all the boxes went back to their former happy state, except for one, which still has a dropdown button as wide as the box. My vba formatting code doesnt help. Rebooting the computer doesnt help. I compared the properties window for two boxes that should be identical except for name and left position, and nothing is different there. p  pSo is there anyway I can tame, reset, or otherwise control this renegade dropdown button I wish I wasnt even in Excel dealing with this kind of unpredictable behavior, but Im stuck. p  pHere is my formatting vba p  precode    With ThisWorkbook.SheetscstMatrixSheet.OLEObjectscstMatrixTypeBox          .Width  120         .Top  14         .Left  878          Call FormatComboBox.Object          .Object.AddItem cstAMatrix         .Object.AddItem cstBMatrix         .Object.AddItem cstCMatrix          .Object.Text  cstAMatrix      End With codepre  p...p  precodePrivate Sub FormatComboBoxbxComboBox As msforms.ComboBox      With bxComboBox          .Clear          .Height  19.5         .Font.Name  cstDropBoxFont         .Font.Size  10         .AutoSize  False         .Enabled  True         .Locked  False          .Placement  xlFreeFloating      End With  End Sub codepre

Negative 869 pHappy easters, everyone. p  pI am currently learning topological sort and having a question about what topological sort tries to really sort.p  pThe a hrefhttpwww.algorist.com relnofollowAlgorithm Design Manuala describes topological sort in this way p  blockquote   pTopological sorting is the most important operation on directed acyclic graphs DAGs. strongIt orders the vertices on a line such that all directed edges go from left to right.strongp blockquote  pThis bold part confuses me. So does the topological sorting sort vertices or all directed edgesp  pLets take an example which is also in the book.p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comfdJBN.png altA DAGp  pSo for the above DAG, we can get a topological sort G, A, B, C, F, E, D.p  pI can understand this sort. Not only the vertices are sorted, but the edges are also sorted, i.e., GABCFED, this matches the above ADM book description codeall directed edges go from left to rightcodep  pstrongBut what if I remove the edge of BCstrong The resulting graph is still a DAG, but will the topological sort is still G, A, B, C, F, E, D p  pIf it is Yes, then I think the edges are not sorted, as ABC does not exist any more, instead, it is AB and AC. So, it this case still a valid topological sort Can we still  think G, A, B, C, F, E, D is a valid sort even if A is the parent of B and Cp  pThanksp

Negative 869 pIm working with some very old, monolithic software that is basically a heavily customized JBoss deployment.  Unfortunately, this means that JBoss cant be started from the Servers view in Eclipse, it must be started as a Windows service or via the command line.  There are multiple WARsEARs, but the WAR classloaders are rarely used and most of the actual class files are located in jbosssharedlib as .jars.  p  pWe need a way to run a Maven build in Eclipse via m2e and deploy the class files in the resulting .jar to Cproductjbosssharedlib so that when we start JBoss, we can use Eclipse to debug as a remote java application.  Ideally, the artifact that Maven pushes will not overwrite the existing .jar file that was originally installed.  For example, if  the Maven project builds an artifact named myjar1.0.0.jar, we need a way to deploy the classes inside of myjar1.0.0.jar to Cproductjbosssharedlibclasses so that they are picked up by the classloader prior to Cproductjbosssharedlibmyjar1.0.0.jar, which was installed with the product.p  pCurrently, our emveryem hacky solution is thisp  ol lipUnder the project configurations codeJava Build Pathcode  codeSourcecode tab, we use the symlink functionality under codeAdvancedcode to map the codeDefault Output Directorycode e.g. projecttargetclasses to a class folder e.g. CproductjbosssharedlibclassFolder.  This modifies the .project file, which is checked into source control.p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comBz9bR.png altsymlink madnesspli liWe build the project normally with a m2e launcher e.g. clean install.li lipAssuming the Maven build is successful, we run an Eclipse project build.  This pushes the class files to CproductjbosssharedlibclassFolderp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comkYoys.png altclassFolderpli liWe restart JBoss.

Negative 869 pId like to know if I could customize my entities in EF which dont necessarily correspond to all fields in the database table. This way I can make use of the built in MVC validation features.p  pHeres a simplified example of what Im trying to do. So lets say I have a Person table defined as  p  pId,br Name,br  Place of birth. p  pIn the View, the user would type in its name, and then select the country of birth and then its location. There is no need to store the country of birth in the person table as a location belongs to a country, but the country needs to be selected in the view so the location options are populated. p  pThe country is therefore a required value in the view.p  pI know I could manually validate this required value on the server, but Id like to know if I could define an extra property in the EF entity called CountryId which would be marked as required and then I get all the default MVC validation features. p  pIf this is a common practice links to helpful tutorials would be appreciated.p  pThanksp

Negative 869 pI have a ViewPager with ImageView as child views. The ImageView displays Bitmap loaded from network andor cached to local cache implemented as LruCache based class from Android support library. The problem is that when the images are removed from LruCache, the GC seems to not release or release too late the bitmap memory. I very often get the exception OutOfMemory while loading new bitmap from networkdisk even if the old bitmaps are removed from LruCache and from the holding ImageViews of ViewPager I removed views from ViewPager. I read that sometimes  you must call the Bitmap.recycle prior to Android 3.0 but this does not work. It also does not work on ICS I do not call Bitmap.recycle there.  How to solve this problemp

Negative 869 pI was wondering if there was a way to strip the extra white space created by EEs template system and produce prettier markup.p  pI like to keep my templates readable. I often times come back to jobs years later, have to follow other developers work, or work as part of a team, and its easier when everything is neat and nested.p  pThe problem is that EE preserves all of the tabs and line breaks, and when you have a lot of conditionals and such, it results in ugly code. For example, thisp  precodeltdiv class     event if eventalldayalldayif      if eventmultidaymultidayif      if eventfirstdayfirstdayif      if eventlastdaylastdayif      if alldayeventindexdifference gt 0indexdifferencealldayeventindexdifferenceif gt     if eventmultiday          lta hrefpathcalendarmaineventeventidgteventtitleltagt     ifelse         lta hrefpathcalendarmaineventif editedoccurrenceeventparentidifelseeventidif titleeventtitlegteventtitleltagt     if ltdivgt codepre  pRenders into thisp  precodeltdiv class                                          event allday                                           multiday                                                                                   gt                                           lta hrefhttpwww.downtownmuncie.orgcalendarmainevent1832gtMinnetrista Glass Showltagt                                                                        ltdivgt codepre  pEvery tab and linebreak surrounding the EE tags is preserved, so I wind up with a mile of white space between the codeltdivgtcode and codeltdivgtcode.p  pPerformancewise, it doesnt mean a thing. There may be an argument to be made for an increase in file size, but its negligible. Its also a bit of a hinderance when trying to navigate through the code using Firebug. p  pBut most of all, it just looks sloppy. p  pOne suggestion is to adjust the templates accordingly, like sop  precodeltdiv classevent if eventalldayallday ifif eventmultidaymultiday ifif eventfirstdayfirstday ifif eventlastdaylastday ifif alldayeventindexdifference gt 0 indexdifferencealldayeventindexdifferenceifgt     if eventmultidaylta hrefpathcalendarmaineventeventidgteventtitleltagtifelselta hrefpathcalendarmaineventif editedoccurrenceeventparentidifelseeventidif titleeventtitlegteventtitleltagtif ltdivgt codepre  pThats not really a viable solution.

Negative 869 pIn InDesign I can define buttons and can add different actions to them. One of these actions is go to page, but apparently that function is only usable when exporting the InDesign document as an SWF. However, we want to export an interactive PDF.p  pWhen we open the exported PDF in Adobe Acrobat Professional we can touch up each and every button in the document and set the page to the page we want, but this is of course extremely tedious work, especially when you have several proving runs. p  pSo, my question is how do I get my buttons in InDesign to jump to a specific page without having to do the touch up late in Adobe Acrobat Professional Surely it must be possible to navigate between pagesp

Negative 869 pSo this is gnarly. I have a piece of code that used the Columbia Physics System c library. I get a segfault when I run it, most probably because the classes CgArg, and vector ffieldin, etc are uninitialised. I used Valgrind and found that indeed the various arguments were pointing to invalid memory.p  pThe strange this is that if I insert an iostream call anywhere in the two functions, the segfault goes away. I found out when I put flags in places to debug. It also doesnt segfault if I define an integer and write a simple cin . Thats why I think its something to do with iostream.p  pIf you know of any reason why a call to iostream would somehow give pieces of code to the arguments, Id be very thankful if you shared it with me.p  precodeinclude ltiostreamgt using namespace std  include ltconfig.hgt include ltutillattice.hgt include ltutildiracop.hgt include ltutilgjp.hgt include ltinterface.hgt  define CLOVERMATSIZE 72  USINGNAMESPACECPS   Same function for clover matrix and its inverse. static void interfacedouble hqudaclover, double hcpsclover    hqudaclover[0]hcpsclover[0]   c0000re  C0.x, A0 codepre  p...and lots more of this stuff...  p  precode  hqudaclover[3536]hcpsclover[3436]   c3231im  C8.w, A5   static void fillhcloverinvLattice amplat, int site[], double hqudacloverinvsite    double hcpscloverinv[72]   Vector ffieldout, ffieldin   CgArg arg   CnvFrmType convertCNVFRMNO   DiracOpClover diraclat,ffieldout,ffieldin,arg,convert   cout ltlt B  ltlt site ltlt endl   cout ltlt B site  ltlt site[0] ltlt   ltlt site[1] ltlt   ltlt site[2] ltlt   ltlt         site[3] ltlt endl   dirac.SiteCloverMatsite,hcpscloverinv   interfacehqudacloverinvsite,hcpscloverinv   void fillhcloverinvallLattice amplat, double hqudacloverinv, int parity    double ptrhqudacloverinv   int nsites[4]   nsites[0]GJP.XnodeSites   nsites[1]GJP.YnodeSites   nsites[2]GJP.ZnodeSites   nsites[3]GJP.TnodeSites   int site[4]   cout ltlt A  ltlt site ltlt endl   for site[3]  0 site[3] lt nsites[3] site[3]      for site[2]  0 site[2] lt nsites[2] site[2]        for site[1]  0 site[1] lt nsites[1] site[1]          site[0]  site[3]  site[2]  site[1]  parity2         for  site[0] lt nsites[0] site[0]  2    cout ltlt A site  ltlt site[0] ltlt   ltlt site[1] ltlt   ltlt site[2] ltlt   ltlt     site[3] ltlt endl           fillhcloverinvlat,site,ptr           ptr  CLOVERMATSIZE                          codepre

Negative 869 pI am trying to automate the deployment of some virtual machines within my local development environment, using Vagrant. I have an environment where virtual machines can be spun up on demand from a command line script basically wraps codevagrant upcode.p  pThe problem being that I need to point to them from the host machine so I can access the web server by hostname. Therefore I need to have some way of knowing the IP address of the machine Im spinning up so that I can make a change to etchosts on the host machine to point to the VM.p  pI have read the networking articles in the Vagrant documentation and particularly this looks interesting a hrefhttpvagrantup.comv1docshostonlynetworking.html relnofollowhttpvagrantup.comv1docshostonlynetworking.htmlap  pUsing this method I can assign static IP addresses to the VM. This would be fine if I could predict how many virtual machines I have running, or who is running them the VM configurations well be distributed to other developers too.p  pEssentially what I need is a VM registry which will map virtual machine configurations to IP addresses so that they are predictable and then I can map that registry to etchosts. Furthermore this registry would need to be unique per developer as at some point I may have dozens of VM configurations so checking to see which IPs in a range are already assigned may be cumbersome, especially if we have multiple developers creating these VMs.p  pSo my question is...p  pHow can I automate the assignment of available IP addresses for virtual machines so that I can predict them when they are spun up in a bash script, and then automate adding to the host machines etchosts file emandem avoid IP address conflictsp

Negative 869 pIn this threadp  pa hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions14150508howtogetnullinsteadofthekeynotfoundexceptionaccessingdictionaryvaluebHow to get null instead of the KeyNotFoundException accessing Dictionary value by keyap  pin my own answer I used explicit interface implementation to change the basic dictionary indexer behaviour not to throw codeKeyNotFoundExceptioncode if the key was not present in the dictionary since it was convinient for me to obtain codenullcode in such a case right inline.p  pHere it isp  precodepublic interface INullValueDictionaryltT, Ugt     where U  class      U this[T key]  get    public class NullValueDictionaryltT, Ugt  DictionaryltT, Ugt, INullValueDictionaryltT, Ugt     where U  class      U INullValueDictionaryltT, Ugt.this[T key]              get                      if ContainsKeykey                 return this[key]             else                 return null                codepre  pSince in a real application I had a list of dictionaries, I needed a way to access the dictionaries from the collection as an interface. I used simple codeintcode indexer to acess each element of the list.p  precodevar list  new ListltNullValueDictionaryltstring, stringgtgt int index  0 ... list[index][somekey]  somevalue codepre  pThe easiest thing was to do something like thisp  precodevar idict  INullValueDictionaryltstring, stringgtlist[index] string value  idict[somekey] codepre  pThe question raised when I decided to try to use covariance feature to have a collection of interfaces to use instead. So I needed an interface with covariant type parameter for the cast to work. The 1st thing that came to my mind was codeIEnumerableltTgtcode, so the code would look like thisp  precodeIEnumerableltINullValueDictionaryltstring, stringgtgt ilist  list string value  ilist.ElementAtindex[somekey] codepre  pNot that nice at all, besides codeElementAtcode instead of an indexer is way worse. The indexer for codeListltTgtcode is defined in codeIListltTgtcode, and codeTcode there is not covariant.p  pWhat was I to do I decided to write my ownp  precodepublic interface IIndexedEnumerableltout Tgt      T this[int index]  get    public class ExtendedListltTgt  ListltTgt, IIndexedEnumerableltTgt    codepre  pWell, few lines of code I dont even need to write anything in codeExtendedListltTgtcode, and it works as I wantedp  precodevar elist  new ExtendedListltNullValueDictionaryltstring, stringgtgt IIndexedEnumerableltINullValueDictionaryltstring, stringgtgt ielist  elist int index  0 ... elist[index][somekey]  somevalue string value  ielist[index][somekey] codepre  pFinally the question can this covariant cast be somehow achieved without creating an extra collectionp

Negative 869 pAt work we have an application that we need to update.  It is a fat client that is largely written in Windows Forms with newer parts of it being in WPF.  The main section of this application is a form designer that is implemented with a Web Browser control using HTML.p  pWe need to redesign a large portion of the application and need to generally improve the user experience.  Theres a good chance that I will be the one working on this project and I am very familiar with WPF and feel like it would be a very suitable technology to use.  I would plan to remove the old windows forms portions and largely rewrite the application.  p  pHowever, there has been some discussion of migrating this application to be a web application in a future release.  My coworker was tossing around the idea of trying to redesign the dialogs and application using HTML while still being a fat client.  p  pDoes this seem like a reasonable idea  Is there any kind of design similar to this approach that would support this kind of hybrid application  Would we be able to realistically create the same kind of user experience using HTML5  JS that WPF would offerp  pThe idea of making portable code is enticing, but I have serious concerns about the feasibility of this suggestion.  I know that windows 8 apps support a variety of design options, but this application would be targeted for xp  windows 7.p

Now Im using extall.js which has 1.3MB minified which is pretty large imho...and things get magically loaded while he does the second check...but I think those 2 functions are not the same as they definitions suggest, because if I put another document.ready instead of Ext.onReady line, things break again.

Negative 869 pWhat are the ways to communicate between an Activity and a Service on androidp  pToday I learnt how to communicate by sending an Intent from Activity and replying back using BroadcastRecevier.p  pWhich are my other options Does anyone have a tutorialreference regarding thisp  pAnswer to this question isp  pThere are several way for an activity to communicate with an service and vice versa. This section dicusses the different ways and gives recommendation which to use.p  p5.1. Activity binding to local service If the Service is started in the same process as the Activity, the Activity can directly bind to the service. This is a relatively simple and efficient way to communication.p  p5.2. Using receiver You can also use dynamically registered receivers for the communication. For example your activity can dynamically register a receiver and the service sends outs corresponding events.p  p5.3. AIDL for services in a different process To bind to a service which runs in a different process you need to use Inter Process Communication IPC as the data needs to be send between different processes. For this you need to create a AIDL file which looks similar to an Java interface but ends with the .aidl file extension and is only allowed to extend other AIDL files.p  pThis approach is required if your service should be provided to other applications, otherwise you should prefer a local service.p  p5.4. Sending Intent data and bundle to the services The service receives data from the starting Android component and can use this data.p  p5.5. Handler and Messenger If the service should be communicating back to the activity it can receive an object of type Messenger via the Intent data it receives from the Activity. If the Messenger is bound to a Handler in the activity the service can send objects of type Message to the activity.p  pA Messenger is parcelable, which means it can be passed to another process and you can use this object to send Messages to the Handler in the activity.p  pMessenger provides also the method getBinder which allows to pass a Messenger to the activity. The Activity can therefore send Messages to the service.p  pThanks to a hrefhttpwww.vogella.comarticlesAndroidServicesarticle.html relnofollowhttpwww.vogella.comarticlesAndroidServicesarticle.htmlap

Negative 869 pI am running some experiments to benchmark the time it takes by mapreduce to read and process data stored on HDFS with varying parameters. I use pig script to launch mapreduce jobs. Since I am working with the same set of files frequently, my results may get affected because of fileblock caching.p  pI want to understand the various caching techniques employed in a mapreduce environment. p  pLets say that a file codefoocode contains some data to be procesed stored on HDFS occupies code1code HDFS block and it gets stored in machine codeSTOREcode. During a mapreduce task, machine codeCOMPUTEcode reads that block over network and processes it. Caching can happen at two levelsp  ol liCached in memory of machine codeSTOREcode inmemory file cacheli liCached in memorydisk of machine codeCOMPUTEcode.li ol  pI am pretty sure that code1code caching happens. I want to ensure whether something like code2code happens From the post a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions10099816whatdoeslocalcachingofdatameaninthecontextofthisarticleherea, it looks like there is no client level caching going on since it is very unlikely that the block cached by codeCOMPUTEcode will be needed again in the same machine before the cache is flushed.p  pAlso, is the hadoop distributed cache used only to distribute any application specific files not task specific input data files to all task tracker nodes Or is the task specific input file data like the codefoocode file block cached in the distributed cache I assume codelocal.cache.sizecode and related parameters only control the distributed cache. p  pPlease clarify.p

Negative 869 pHeres my code for calculating a full house using 5 die. Now some numbers will work, such as if I roll a 1, 6, 6, 6, 1. But if I roll a 4, 4, 5, 5, 4. It will not work, and I have no idea. I know there is a lot of if statements and it could have done better, but I am a beginner programmer, and this is what I feel comfortable doing since I cant do a complex, logical algorithm.

Negative 869 pI made my java project into an executable jar using the export to jar option in eclipse. The jar runs as expected, except that it does not use any of the serialized files.

Negative 869 pIm making an iPad app which will be distributed from my own web server using Enterprise Distribution Program. The app itself checks for a newer version on the server and calls itmsservices in IOS to update itself.

Negative 869 pWhile working with Core Data, I have found that my codeUIManagedDocumentcode object has a codedocumentStatecode equal to 5. The a hrefhttpdeveloper.apple.comlibraryiosdocumentationuikitreferenceUIDocumentClassUIDocumentUIDocument.html relnofollowcodeUIDocumentcode documentationa only defines these constantsp  precodeenum      UIDocumentStateNormal           0,    UIDocumentStateClosed           1 ltlt 0,    UIDocumentStateInConflict       1 ltlt 1,    UIDocumentStateSavingError      1 ltlt 2,    UIDocumentStateEditingDisabled  1 ltlt 3    typedef NSInteger UIDocumentState codepre  pWhich would be 0, 1, 2, 4 and 8. 5 might be a special state that codeUIManagedDocumentcode uses, but I cant find it documented anywhere. The state seems to occur when the Core Data schema is changed. I dont know what the state means. I usually get the error codeTerminating app due to uncaught exception NSInternalInconsistencyException, reason This NSPersistentStoreCoordinator has no persistent stores.  It cannot perform a save operation.code, which makes sense because the document needs to be opened in a normal state in order to be used as the persistent store.p  pRight now I am just checking for the state being equal to 5 and deleting the persistent store and recreating it when this occurs. But once my app is live and storing user data, I wont want to be doing this. I havent looked into best practices for migrating Core Data schemas, but it seems kind of messy too to be checking for codemanagedDocument.documentState  5code in my code. Is there not any documentation on this document state anywherep  pstrongUpdatestrong Now that Im looking at it, it would make sense that the reason these constants are defined the way they are is so that they can be bitwise ored together as masks. So a codedocumentStatecode equal to 5 would imply it is both codeUIDocumentStateClosedcode as well as codeUIDocumentStateSavingErrorcode. These errors are pretty general though. How would I go about narrowing the root causep  pAlso, all the example code Ive seen for checking for these document states show checking for equality, i.e. codeif managedDocument.documentState  UIDocumentStateClosedcode, but this would imply this is not correct and should rather be checked with a bitwise and, i.e. codeif managedDocument.documentState amp UIDocumentStateClosedcode.p

Negative 869 pI have a problem with an application that I wrote in .NETC. It consists of a server which manages a few other machines, and runs tests on them. It is a windows forms application. In order to run tests with proper error handling, for each machine I have two threads one for running tests and one that pings it continuously. Each machine has a running queue, in which tasks are stored, tasks that will be run on that particular machine.br The issue is that after some time, when more than a few tasks are present in the queue, the memory it consumesprocess explorer, task manager gradually increases from about 50100MB to 1.61.8 GB. At about this limit almost every transactionfile copy on share, remote WMI access with the remote machines fails with either Not enough storage or Out of memory. I tried some tools in order to localize the string and the closest I got was .Net Memory Profiler. That wasnt of great help, because the largest amount of memory was residing in Private Data  Unidentified. This Im guessing its unmanaged data, because I can evaluate every other datafrom my program down to each string and int, and every instance of it.br Can anyone suggest a tool I can use in order to properly localize the leak and maybe fix it. It would help me a lot if I would know the DLLfrom my appThread that uses that memory, or at least if I can view somehow what is in that memory. p  pNote A lot of posts are out there about the two exceptions Not enough storage, and Out of memory. Most of them suggest increasing the IRPStackSize on the server machinein my case, clients. I have IRPStackSize of 500x32 on all of the machines, including the server.p  pstrongEDITstrongbr Regarding the comments yes, I do maintain a log, but nothing strange happens. Using a memory profiler I discovered that my application, the .NET side uses about 20MB of memory when the unmanaged part is well over 1GB. With the help of WinDbg I found out what resides in that extra memoryin most of it. In order to access the machines and run different tests on them I use WMI, for which I have a wrapper. Everything I use is being disposedusing statements, and for some actually calling the Dispose method. Strangely though, the memory is filled with clones of this class. Does anyone know why a class would clone itself in memory.br Note the rate at which the memory usage increases in about 5MBs, so its not really over a long period of time. I also wonder why it is not being freed by the garbage collector. I am using C classes to work with WMI, not COM, nor unmanaged code. Also, among the objects on the heap I see a lot of data belonging to wmiutils, CWbemError. Oddly enough, google doesnt even know the wordno results for CWbemErrorp

Negative 869 pI am having problems getting Microsofts MVCs code[ValidateAntiForgeryToken]code to work with a Single Page Application SPA written using Marionette amp Backbone. The problem seems to be that the MVC code[ValidateAntiForgeryToken]code method fails to see the token we send as part of the JSON.

Negative 869 pSometimes when you write programs in Python, the need for using special libraries may arise.  For example, when writing a script codeX.pycode you might need to handle operations between matrices and so you would go for the Numpy library, or you may need to read and write raster files and you would go for GDAL library which support raster manipulation.  In the case of Numpy you would simply have to install the library, but for GDAL you would first have to install GDAL utility on your operating system and then install the associated Python bindings. Now, to successfully run the script X.py you would need a computer that has Python installed and the associated libraries.  What about making an executable codeX.execode out of this script Could you run it on any Windows OS or you would need Numpy and GDAL installed on that OS to be able to successfully execute itp

Negative 869 pI have a big problem with using boost layouts. Im using directed graph and FruchtermanReingold layout algorithm. The topology I use is rectangle topology. I have to organize around 200 elements on my scene Im using QT scene and items to do it. Boost library is used only to calculate position of elements. My items are rectangles with different size, but we can say its constant to simplify. Everything works pretty well, except that some of my items sometimes lay on each other. I tried to change, both, attraction and repulsive force but its still doesnt work at all.p  pMy question is there any way to push away elements from each other. I found something called jitter points in FruchtermanReingold algorithm, but changing it didnt help me. Maybe there is way to use rectangle size instead of point topologyltpointtype but i cant find it p  pThanks for every idea and help.p

GAE locks you into a tremendously suboptimal storage   mechanism. GAE is free, but so is Stax and there are many inexpensive   options including SliceHost.  Next up, youve got Amazon EC2 and   RackSpace. So, I havent found a good reason for anyone to use GAE.    And if theres no good reason to use GAE, devoting a pile of resources   to code around the GAE JVM incompatibilities e.g., no new threads   seems like a waste.p blockquote  pAnother issue if I go with GAE is stronglack of Play 2.1 supportstrong.

People with the same codeuseridcode have multiple medals, so my data looks like thisp  precodeuserid  medalid 101       1 123       2 101       2 144       1 144       2 .... codepre  pI need to select with Zend all of the medals with, say, a codemedalidcode of 2.  Using codeSELECT ... NOT INcode will eliminate rows 2,3 and 5 from my selection.  But I also need to eliminate the other two rows since they have a codeuseridcode that matches the rows Im trying to eliminate from my selection.  In other words, Im trying to eliminate rows with a codeuseridcode that matches anything in my codeNOT INcode array.  There will be an array of medals in the selection.  Here is what I am thinkingp  precodedbgtselectgtfrommedals    gtwheremedalid NOT IN , medalIdsArray    gtwhereuserid NOT IN ,  codepre  pBut I have no idea what to put for the blank.  Im wondering if I need some kind of subselect.  I just dont know where to start  Can someone help  Thanks.p
Negative 869 pIm pretty new to web development, and Ive encountered the following problem I dont really understand. Working in VS2010 with visual basic.p  pI have a page aspx, which has a gridview, and this has a few columns, including a column with tickboxes and a column action, which has an empty, hidden dropdownlist to begin with every row has this. p  pWhenever a user ticks a box, I retrieve some values from the server with an AJAXcall which is my first attempt at AJAX  and with those values I populate a dropdownlist in the action colum of the selected row. So far so good.p  pThe user can then make a selection on the dropdownlist, en then he presses a button upload, and a postback is done to process the information.p  pHowever, in the code behind, I cant retrieve the added items in the dropdownlist let alone the selected value. I CAN retrieve the dropdownlist, but it has no items.p  pAfter googling for some time I realised that clientside changes are not persisted when the form is posted to the server, which I understand but it also seems odd. The dropdown is created when the page is created, so why doesnt it store the javasciptadded items Especially since a few workarounds I found use a hiddenfield to store the added items or selectedvalue. If I can store them in a hiddenfield, why cant I store them in the actual dropdownlistp  pIm obviously not understanding how websites work... But this means that, after a page is initially loaded, you can change values in dropdowns and listboxes and such, but these will never be available serversidep  pEdit some code the first a javascriptsnippet how I add the different values I retrieved through the AJAX callp  precodevar drop  row.findElementddlAction find the dropdownelement in the DOM for j  0 j lt dropdownitems.length j  add all the options from xml      option  document.createElementoption      option.text  dropdownitems[i].getAttributetext      option.value  dropdownitems[i].getAttributevalue      drop.addoption, null  codepre  pThis works fine, the dropdownlist is filled and I can select. But when the page gets posted I do the following in the server codep  precodeDim SelCount As Integer  LocalFilesGrid.SelectedItems.Count If SelCount gt 0 Then    For Each dataItem In LocalFilesGrid.SelectedItems        Dim drop As DropDownList        drop  dataItem.FindControlddlAction        If drop.Items.Count  0 Then always zero           MsgBoxNope        End If    Next End If codepre  pId like to be able to loop through the selected rows of the grid, get the corresponding dropdownlist and selectedvalue.p

So my question is am I over complicating things causing me to write a much longer script than needed I have read a little bit about things like Regular Expressions and how they can really shortened script lengths and the time it takes to write them would that or maybe another technique of been more useful than all the loops I had to makep

Negative 869 pHi I am android developer. I already build android NFC reader and writer and beam. So using writer i can write simple data on NFC tags and with the help of reader I can read data from tag. Using beam I can transmit data between two NFC enabled devices. So till now everything works fine. Now I want to work on NFC payments. I am working on android platform. So my question is that how NFC readers works which are use for payments. Are they work on Beam or our device act as nfc tag for NFC readers and it simply reads data from device.Mean how on device side I conform that this reader is for payments or something else. I read about HCE of android it helps a lot for understanding concept. But I am bit confuse regarding readers concepts and there working scenarios. Is there any one can help me out to understand this things, Need Help. Thank you.p

Negative 869 pIm trying to optimizie an IO bound C Win32 application. What it actually does is something very similar to recurse a folder and compute a cryptographic hash of every file it finds. Its a single threading application using memory mapped files, so as its easy to imagine it doesnt seem to use much CPU since most of the times the main thread is put to sleep waiting for IO to complete. Im thinking about a couple of solutions, but Im not sure about it so Id like to have your opinions.p  ol liI could spawn many threads  having a fixed size pool of workers to keep memory usage under certain threshold , but honestly I dont know if this can make the situation better, each thread is gonna be put to sleep just like my main thread in the current implementation, plus the scheduler would waste lot of computation power to switch contexts.li liI was thinking about IO completion ports  single thread multi , but that would mean to abandon the memory mapped files  am I wrong   and use standard file operations. If this is the case, could you please provide me some example code on how to use IOCP to read and elaborate a given list of files without putting the reading thread to sleep li ol  pAny other ideasuggestionetc would be really appreciated  p  pThanks.p
Negative 869 pI have a Fragment containing a LinearLayout where different items are inflated depending on some business logic. On of these items contains an EditText. When I have multiple of these items with different content and I detachattach the fragment, all EditTexts somehow get all the same text.

Negative 869 pI want to create a static twig file whenever a operation like persist or update  will be done in Admin. What i am thinking is to create a listener called GenerateStaticListener. The listener will listen  the events postPersist or postUpdate and called the custom function. The Custom function will fetch the item from database and write it into the html file and then i will include the twig filehtml file  into my layout. The purpose for this is to generate a html file i.e twig once so that to fetch the item from database query will not hit again  and again on database and give better performance.p  pstrongScenariostrongp  pThe Menu section of my site contain lots of items.And fetching will be done from more than one table and around 10 queries will be fired to fetch the items.

Negative 869 pI am working with an equipment reservation system and need to calculate days that the equipment is being rented for so I can multiply it by the total cost per day of each reservation, then total the cost for all reservations in the query. The equipment pickup date and return date are stored in separate fields as yyyymmdd 000000.000 no entries contain a time other than 000000.000, there is also fields for pickup AMPM and return AMPM. If the pickup date is in the PM then that day does not count as a day, if the return date is in the AM then it does not count as a day. Ideally I would like to use the query below to get to my end goal, however it calculates the number of days as too many. p  precodeSELECT     SUMTOTALDATEDIFFday,PICKUPDT,RETURNDT  FROM     RENTAL  WHERE     AGENTCODE  AGENT AND     PICKUPDT gt 06012013 AND     RETURNDT lt 06012014 AND     PAIDOUT  1  codepre  pThe above is nested within the whole query that I am running. The TOTAL field is the cost per day of rental. I need a way to accurately count the number of days the consumer will be charged for. I appreciate any help that can be given on the topic.

Negative 869 pIm dealing with a project that has a large number of dependencies. This has become a problem because when adding new SDKs were going past the maximum limit of methods that an APK can hold 65536. p  pIm looking at using the new build system in Android Studio in order to create build variants that rely on subsets of our dependencies. I was able to find a number of tutorials that help with creating different class alternatives using build flavours, but I didnt find anything regarding specifying different dependencies for each flavour. Is this even possible What would the whole workflow look likep  pFor example, I would like to create a build variant that removes Flurry support. I would be able to create a different class that does not instantiate the Flurry SDK, but I would also like to be able to remove the lib dependency entirely, in order to reduce the total number of methods in the APK.p  pIm also open to any suggestion regarding managing this kind of issue p

Negative 869 pWithin a griview using IE, cells in one column are clickable through gridview row command event and once a cell is clicked it displays a hidden textbox visible  false before the cell is clicked users can enter text into the textbox and to allow saving changes made to the textbox users are told to press Tab key.  The saving is done through using Javascript by checking keycode in keydown event, it simply checks when codekeycode  9 Tab key doPostbackOnClick,SaveButtoncode in codebehind codeSaveButtoncode onclick event simply calls a store procedure to save the new text changes into database.p  pThe problem I have is keydown event is not ALWAYS fired though it works most of the time. There seems to be no difference to the situation when it works and when it doesnt, so to me its a bit random and I have to emphaise that it works 90 of the time. p  pWorth mentioning that when users click the cell to edit the textbox, gridview row updating event is fired first since I need to enable gridview row updating event not only for this column text changes but also for other columns data updating.p  pWhen everything works after user pressing the Tab key, the event sequence is p  ol liGridview row updating  li liKeydownSaveButton click  li liGridview row updatingli ol  pI dont understand what triggers the event 3 i.e. the second gridview row updating event though it doesnt do any harm to anything as its after the text being saved into database. But when pressing Tab key doesnt work text not saved the second gridview row updating event is not fired only the 1st row updating event is fired and textbox changes are lost reverting back to the original text.p  pIm new to asp.net and hope someone can shred some light on this problem.p

Negative 869 pFrom the javadoc of List.scalap  precode Time List has O1 prepend and headtail access. Most other operations are On on the number of elements in the list.    This includes the indexbased lookup of elements, length, append and reverse. codepre  pThis compares unfavorably with ArrayList in java.  Yes I realize it is mutable and List is not .. but giving up that performance is a nonstarter.p  pSo then what is a likely preferred goto immutable List implementation in Scala with O1 for index based lookup and preferably for length as well.  It is understandableaccepted that append and reverse are Onp  pstrongUpdatestrong  Omnomnom nominated Vector and I concur awaiting his making a real answer on this.p  pFrom the javadoc on Vectorp  blockquote   pVector is a generalpurpose, immutable data structure. It provides   random access and updates in effectively constant time, as well as   very fast append and prepend. Because vectors strike a good balance   between fast random selections and fast random functional updates,   they are currently the default implementation of immutable indexed   sequences.p blockquote

Negative 869 pIn my iOS app I have to have some native code and some web code. I am having a little difficulty integrating the navigation of the two.p  pFor iOS I am using an embedded UINavigationController. In the web app I am using a single page application control with the  Application Page doing the navigation through the web pages.p  pHere is the problem. On the first web page I suppress the navigation, as I want to use the iOS navigation there to go back to from the main menu. A user taps the a list entry and the 2nd web page appears. Here I want to do the opposite  suppress the iOS Navigation but show the web navigation.p  pSo I use the method shouldStartLoadingWithRequest to control whether or not to show the native UINavigation Controller.

What I think I need is a way to fire off this method if the uiView changesp  pOr is there a better way to handle thisp

Negative 869 pI have a application which load plugins that are in the form of bpls.

Negative 869 pI initially had my NodeEntity class having a GraphProperty of java.util.Date type. The graph repository APIs automatically convert that to long  string value and stores it based on my property type.  As I wanted to import huge chunk of data from csv, I wanted this date field in my custom or predefined string format, say yyyyMMdd. So I wrote my spring converter factories for both String  Date and DAte  String and registered them in the spring xml for conversion service. But unfortunately my converter was never called. Only the standard converter was called. Later, when I wrap the date object inside MyDate class and changed the converter to String  MyDAte and vice versa instead of java.util.Date, converter was called and the required serialization was done. I dont want this MyDate wrapper around Date just for the sake of converter. Now, my question is, how to override the default date converter with my convertersp
Negative 869 pIve looked around at different sites, and cannot find any answer to this question, other than ones that dont seem that they would work. As the title says, I am trying to find a way to catch if the library I am working on crashes. I have a Root class that holds instances of the many managerstyle classes that I have in my library, and it releases the instances in its destructor. Naturally, the managers are responsible for quite a bit of data, so if they are not properly disposed of there is a chance for a rather unacceptable, even dangerous level of memory leaks.p  pI am aware that, when a program crashes, that the OS will deallocate the stack space for the program, but that does not include calling the destructors of the allocated objects. It also does not include deleting any of the heap allocated during the execution, which is how I am dealing with a good deal of the memory in my library, which goes back to problem of widespread memory leaks.p  pA good deal of the answers I am coming across on other sites are just saying to register a function with codeatexitcode, but that function does not work if the application crashes. And, as stated above, since crashes do not call destructors, there is no way to make a global singleton that closes everything when it is destroyed, which was my initial idea of how to deal with this. My other idea was to just hope that the end user of the library will take the proper precautions to avoid crashes through widespread use of exception throwing, but I feel that goes against the idea of a wellcoded library, and frankly I think its asking a bit much of the end user to deal with that.p  pSo I guess my TLDR question is this Is there a way, either through a standard C function, or through some sort of manager class, to catch when a library crashes and deal with it appropriatelyp  pEDIT Also, I would really prefer a cross platform way to deal with this. My code base heavily uses features of C11, so Ive programatically limited the useable compilers to the latest versions of GCC and Clang.p  pNot only that, but I also have a couple of classes, like a Logger, that will close their stream to the filesystem and print out a couple of messages about the exit status. I also have a memory tracker that reports any possible memory leaks to a file, but only in its destructor.p
Negative 869 pIn my application, a user can upload a file of a few specific types, one of which needs to be a supposedly older excel file type codeapplicationvnd.msofficecode.p  pI have codemimexls,doc,csvcode but those dont validate against mime type codeapplicationvnd.msofficecode.p  pIve look around a few other places and making the validator rule codemimexls,doc,csv,applicationvnd.msofficecode does not work.p  pI can get it to work if I edit codeSymfonyComponentHttpFoundationFileMimeTypeMimeTypeExtensionGuessercode to contain codeapplicationvnd.msoffice gt officecode and adjust the validator rule to codemimexls,doc,csv,officecode but I Ill lose that the next time I update via composer.p  pAny way to manipulate the mime types array ontheflyp  pAlso, codeapplicationvnd.msofficecode seems like it might include a broad spectrum of files.

I was wondering if there was a long running method on the captureQueue and that was causing the delay when stopRunning was sent to it, but upon using stopMethod2 I saw the exact same delay. I finally tried stopping the session on the main thread and I had no delay at all. Remember all this is on iOS 8. I grabbed a device with iOS 7 on it and using all three stopMethods I received no delay Im just taking pictures so Im assuming there isnt a lot to shut down. p  pThis is very confusing to me because the documentation says p  precode voidstopRunning   Discussion     This method is used to stop the flow of data from the inputs to the outputs     connected to the AVCaptureSession instance that is the receiver. This method     is synchronous and blocks until the receiver has completely stopped running. codepre  pAnd almost every SO post on this topic says NOT to call stopRunning on the main thread. Is this some sort of weird iOS 8 bug or am I missing somethingp

If you do, congratulations your screwed youll probably be stuck now... Now, fast pressing of ESC or perhaps a rclick in the nodrop zone and more fast pressing of ESC can get you out.p  pAnother way out is to switch to a tty terminal codeAltCtrlF1code and locate and codekill jedit pidcode. p  pAny idea what this feature is called  It is important to know more about it, killing jedit will loose information like ones place withing files.

Negative 869 pIs it possible to get the source of a webpage, which is currently opened in IE or chrome from command line or using a java code I believe there has to be a way.

The first pair goes on well, the rest receive the same object the first pair created.p  precodeprivate Barrier aBarrier private boolean first  true  public synchronized Barrier pairUpint id          try         iffirst             first  false              aBarrier  new Barrier aBarrier.setFirstid              wait                  else             first  true             aBarrier.setLastid              notify                    catchInterruptedException eSystem.out.printfERROR      return aBarrier  codepre  pAnd this would be what every process calling the method above looks like.p  precodeprivate int id  ID OF THE PROCESS, 14 RUN CONCURRENTLY SO FROM 0 TO 13 this is set in the constructor method public void run      whiletrue         myBarrier  pairUpid         myBarrier.goThrough         Do stuff that doesnt matter here          ....        codepre  pA Barrier object contains two integers and a method to do more stuff later.

Negative 869 pIm using fullcalendar in a Drupal 7 site, in conjunction with the Drupal fullcalendar module.  If I set up the calendar in Month View and create an event that runs from, say, October 15 to November 15, that event does not appear in the November calendar when Im running in Ajax mode.  It does appear in the October calendar.  If Im running in nonAjax mode, the event appears in both calendars.  This is happening in both fullcalendar 1.6.4 and 2.2.2.

Negative 869 pI am very new to CC, so I know that this question is probably trivial but I dont understand how to proceed.

I need each block to contain 4 inode structs, but each struct may not have any values associated with it until later on in the program. So for examplep  pcodeinodeFile blockgtfileSize  10codep  pIf I am understanding correctly, this is setting the first 4 bytes of the pointer block to fileSize. I would continue to do this for each field of the struct. p  pMy question is, how can I do this for 4 different inodes And since there are 4 different inodes, how can I return the values of each field for the different structs It seems like simply saying blockfileSize wouldnt work because there can be up to four different file sizes.p

The latter has a method codeNotifyIObservableltTgt observable, ...code that is called by the observable passing itself as parameter via codeobserver.Notifythis, ...code when the observable has changed its state.p  pNow I have stumbled upon events and for me it seems pretty much as if this were an implementation of the observer pattern, just with delegates instead of the aforementioned codeNotifycodemethod. strongIs that rightstrong p  pI do not know much about delegates and do not want to spend hours on rewriting my code just to end up with code that does the same thing as it already does. On the other hand events might be superior to the interfacebased observer pattern. Am I missing somethingp

Negative 869 pIm attempting to make a DotA drafting companion application in C p  pIll give you a little run down of how it will work.  In DotA there are two teams of 5 players.  No character can be picked twice in a single match, meaning teams cannot share a character.  It is important to keep in mind both your teams and opponents picks.  So what this will do is suggest characters for you to pick based on your and your opponents teams.p  pTo clarify, the existing list is not some sort of database, just a menagerie of suggestions on various websites, forums, and videos.  I would be organizing the list myself, and so my question is ultimately what format should I create this list inp  pSo for instance a popular character is Phatom Assassin who is strong with characters who can reduce armor, and weak against characters who can do lots of damage.p  pSo a hero class might look like thisp  precode class DotaHero        Name  Phantom Assassin      vectorltDotaHerogt CountersLina, Lion      vectorltDotaHerogt FriendsTemplar Assassin, Shadow Demon      CImgltunsigned chargt srcPA.jpg   codepre  pMy program would allow you to input the first few heroes and then display a list of characters as a suggestion. p  pShould I...p  ol liCreate a class for each and every hero in the gameli liStream from a text file with each hero delineated by countersfriendsli liCreate some sort of database to store each heros countersfriends in li ol  pPlease feel free to give any suggestionsp

Negative 869 pIs there any way in Eclipse to make a standardized reference to a name in a comment, in such a way, that future refactoring which changes the name in the code will change the reference too By name I mean any of a variable, method, class, or package, either public or not, regardless of which language is being used. I know that Eclipse does so with javadoc references to formal parameters or method names, for instance. I would like to know whether it exists a similar feature for ordinary comments. p  pThank you.p
Negative 869 pI have programmed C for quite a while now. During this time I have learned that it is a common convention to put the character that comes before preprocessordirectives at column one.p  pExamplep  precode include ltstdio.hgt   int mainvoid   ifdef MACRO1  ifdef MACRO2       putsdefinedMACRO1 ampamp definedMACRO2  else       putsdefinedMACRO1  endif  else       putsdefinedMACRO1  endif       return 0   codepre  pWhen people indent their preprocessor directives they usually do it like thisp  precode include ltstdio.hgt   int mainvoid   ifdef MACRO1   ifdef MACRO2      putsdefinedMACRO1 ampamp definedMACRO2   else      putsdefinedMACRO1   endif  else      putsdefinedMACRO1  endif      return 0   codepre  pI do not think that I have ever seen anyone format it like thisp  precode include ltstdio.hgt   int mainvoid   ifdef MACRO1   ifdef MACRO2      putsdefinedMACRO1 ampamp definedMACRO2   else      putsdefinedMACRO1   endif  else      putsdefinedMACRO1  endif      return 0   codepre  pMy question is if the C language standard demands that the codecodecharacter should be in column one.p  pSo is the third option above even legalp  pIf all above cases are legal then I want to know if this is legal.p  precode include ltstdio.hgt   int mainvoid   ifdef MACRO      putsdefinedMACRO   Now there are other characters before the   endif      return 0   codepre  pHere is the codeendifcode no longer on the start of the line because there are other nonwhitespace characters in the way.p  pWhat seems weird about the last example is that codeVimcode texteditor does not highlight the codeendifcode that comes after the comment.p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comVETIB.png altScreenshotp  pAll these examples I have given compiles without any warnings using codegcccode with the codeWall pedanticcode flags turned on including the last one with a comment before codeendifcode.p  pNote that I am just curious about the syntax. I always put codecodecharacter at column one like everyone else when I program. I would never write things like codei endifcode in serious projects.p

Negative 869 pI have a couple questions regarding the innerworkings of DataSets which Ive been unable to find an answer to in a manner that satisfies my needs in order to decide if I can use certain features that are standard on other technologies.p  pSo, Im retrieving information from a database by passing a SQL Query which combines the values of 4 different tables. For this Im passing the query string to an SqlCommand actually, this is done with AseCommand using Sybases implementation which derives from Microsofts implementation and then using an AseDataAdapter to pass the AseCommand, which in turn, already has the connection string.p  pSomething similar to thisp  precodestring query  SELECT tableA.column, tableB.column, tableC.column, tableD.column FROM tableA, TableB, TableC, TableD  AseCommand cmd  new AseCommandquery, conn DataSet ds  new DataSet AseDataAdapter adapter  new AseDataAdaptercmd adapter.Fillds, MyTable codepre  pSo, what this does is define a table with all the output of my little query.p  pNow, I want to be able to use the AseDataAdapter Update method when I have modifications to do, but since I have 4 different tables Im worried about the actual behaviour of this Update if I dont define the relations explicitly. My main concerns focus on these pointsp  ol liBy defining the output table based on the query, does the DataSet automatically know the relations between them or do I have to map those manuallyli liIf the relations are implicit once I call UpdateSave will the modifications be applied on the right tables and columns If not, I will have to define these relations manually rightli liI want the modifications on the Database to occur in a given sequence. In order to do so, will I have to define the relations manually even if they are implicit and will the specified sequence be respectedli liDo I need to define Optimistic Concurrency on the DataAdapter manually Im under the impression that that is the default behaviour, at least I think it should be if Sybases implementation follows Microsofts guidelines.li liLast but not least, is there any way I can define nonmodifiable columns i.e., even if a nonmodifiable column gets modified on the DataSetAdapter for some strange reason can I force the DataAdapter or DataSet to refuse those changes and throw an error I dont want to just ignore it, I want to know if this happens.li ol  pI know these are a lot of questions but reading Sybases documentation a hrefhttpinfocenter.sybase.comhelpindex.jsptopiccom.sybase.help.sdk12.5.1.adonethtmladonetAsadataadapterapiref.htm relnofollowherea and a hrefhttpinfocenter.sybase.comhelpindex.jsptopiccom.sybase.infocenter.dc20066.1500htmladonetInsertingdataadapter.htm relnofollowherea and even some from Microsoft I couldnt see any exact information on the questions that Im asking.p  pI think it all might boil down to are the behaviors standard if I use a SQL statement to produce a DataSet type question.p  pThanks you for your time and consideration.p

I literally had to have a client ship me a laptop that shows the issue, as I couldnt reproduce it on any systems I have here.  Im really at a loss as to the cause...p
Negative 869 pI am changing my UISearchBars font withp  precode voidviewDidLoad  [super viewDidLoad]  Do any additional setup after loading the view.  self.navigationItem.leftBarButtonItem  self.leftButton self.navigationItem.titleView  searchBar  Change font size UITextField txfSearchField  [searchBar valueForKeysearchField] [txfSearchField setDefaultTextAttributes     NSFontAttributeName [UIFont fontWithNameMontserratRegular size30],                                            ]  codepre  pbut it has a side effect of preventing the text from scrolling when the text is longer that the textfields size. In the following screenshot I have written This is a test img srchttpi.stack.imgur.comrTmMf.png altLarger Montserrat makes the typing position stuckp  pHowever if I use Helvetica instead of MontserratRegular the result if fine img srchttpi.stack.imgur.comQ0VgE.png altLarger Helvetica works finep  pEdit Turns out this is a font size issue. The problem happens with any font even Helvetica if you set it above a certain size. This size is different for every font. I think when the fonts height is larger than the textfields height so that it gets cropped this is when the problem happens.p

Negative 869 pGroup box inside the grid is a common layout scheme in WPF applications. Once I had to position several groupboxes inside grid one per each row. Despite of different groupboxes, elements that are inside of those groupboxes must be positioned uniformly according to the grid columns so that the design would be reqular and rhythmic. But this is not possible, because only group boxes inside the grid know about the grid attached properties.p  pNevertheless, I wonder is there a way to make grid properties transparent to all the children without redundant child grids.p

Negative 869 pOk, so I am wrapping up my first fullyformed, beautiful, Java program. Its a practice program Ive been using to teach myself various concepts. Its an election Ballot program. Essentially the user creates a Ballot, sets up elected offices and the candidates running for those offices, and then hits run, and the program creates a new Ballot window that has all of the information in it.p  pEverything works perfectly , but its led to me having a question that I cant seem to find an answer to online.p  pThe size of the Ballot that is generated the height not the width is determined by the size of the longest list of candidates for a particular office. Each new office is another line in the panel, and the panel and the frame respond according. All of this is fine, and the way that it should be.p  pProblem is, it can lead to some LARGE windows. On my 1080p monitor, it can be nearly the full height of the monitor. And thats NOT an exceptional case, I used  real ballots in this case, the 2012 ballot from my town as a model, so having this many candidates on a ballot is very normal.p  pSo, after that long story, Im wondering about best practices when designing windows. The best way to take screen resolution into account and avoid creating problems with a window that might be too large.p  pThanks.p

Negative 869 pThis drives me nuts. In the Visual Studio WinForms designer, if you doubleclick a control it will produce a XXXXLoad handler for that control. This is never, ever, what you want. You want Click event or a Changed event or more likely to go to the existing Click event. You do NOT was a new Load event. It is worse because a double click can happen by accident. You click once, then again  bingo a Load event handler. I use a pentablet combo and double clicks are very easyp  pCan someone tell me if there is a way to stop this happening. I would like a Click handler. I would settle for nothing happening. p

Negative 869 pThis is sort of expanding on my previous question a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions30788885webaudioapionendedeventscope3079047230790472Web Audio API onended event scopea, but I felt it was a separate enough issue to warrant a new thread. p  pIm basically trying to do double buffering using the web audio API in order to get audio to play with low latency. The basic idea is we have 2 buffers. Each is written to while the other one plays, and they keep playing back and forth to form continuous audio.p  pThe solution in the previous thread works well enough as long as the buffer size is large enough, but latency takes a bit of a hit, as the smallest buffer I ended up being able to use was about 4000 samples long, which at my chosen sample rate of 44.1k would be about 90ms of latency.p  pI understand that from the previous answer that the issue is in the use of the onended event, and it has been suggested that a ScriptProcessorNode might be of better use. However, its my understanding that a ScriptProcessorNode has its own buffer of a certain size that is builtin which you access whenever the node receives audio and which you determine in the constructorp  pcodevar scriptNode  context.createScriptProcessor4096, 2, 2  buffer size, channels in, channels outcodep  pI had been using two alternating source buffers initially.

Negative 869 pHow to measure actual bandwidth between server and client to decide how much of realtime data to sendp  pMy server sends readtime data to clients, 30 times per second. If server has too much data it prioritises data chunks and throws away anything that doesnt fit into available bandwidth because this data will be invalidated next tick anyway. Data is sent over reliable 20 and unreliable channels 80 both UDP based but if TCP as a reliable channel can provide any benefit please let me know. Data is highly latencysensitive. Server often but not always has more data than available bandwidth. Its critical to send as much data as possible but not more than available bandwidth to avoid packets drop or higher latency.p  pServer and client are custom applications so can implement any algorithmprotocol.p  pMy main problem is how to keep track of available bandwidth. Also any statistical info about typical bandwidth jitter would be helpful servers are in a cloud, clients are home users, worldwide.p  pAt the moment Im thinking how to utilizep  ul liplatency info of reliable channel. It should correlate with bandwidth because if latency grows this can  mean retransmission is involved as result of packets drop and so server must lower data rate. pli lipdata amount received by client on unreliable channel during time frame. Especially if data amount is lower than what was sent from server.pli lipif current latency is close to or below lowest recorded one, bandwidth can be increasedpli ul  pThe problem is that this approach is too complicated and involves a lot of heuristics like what should be a step to increasedecrease bandwidth etc.p  pLooking for any advice from people who dealt with similar problem in the past or just any bright ideasp

Negative 869 pThough there is another question with the same title, it really does not answer my question and so I am writing this one to clarify my problem.p  pIve developed a relatively small MVVM application in CWPF just for testing purposes. As of now, Im stuck in the reporting part where Im using WPF DocumentViewer to display a text report as print preview. All things are working fine as far as the actual printing of the report is concerned. However, when I display a document as a print preview the DocumentViewer seems to be ignoring or may be overriding  i really dont know the page size as specified by the paginator object. What surprises me is using the Print button from DocumentViewer applies the specified page size to the report while printing but the DocumentViewer itself is not applying it to any of the pages while displaying them. Moreover, the page contents are clipped at the bottom. Again, the problem appears only with DocumentViewer and not with the actual print. The code Im using is given below.p  pstrongMainWindowViewModelstrongp  precodeprivate void PrintReportobject reportType             FlowDocument reportDocument          loads a XAML file containing report template from disk.         reportDocument  System.Windows.Markup.XamlReader.Loadnew FileStreamReportsTemplatesTestReportView.xaml, FileMode.Open, FileAccess.Read as FlowDocument                                                creates report object containing data to be inserted into a        report template loaded above using binding       TestReportViewModel testReportVM  new TestReportViewModelTestReport       testReportVM.LoadReportJZU45, 1, ReportType.Type1         set the DataContext for reportDocument       reportDocument.DataContext  testReportVM         give the binding infrastructure a push       InvokeDispatcher         display report       SelectedView  new PrintReportViewModelreportDocument      codepre  pstrongPrintReportViewModelstrongp  precodepublic PrintReportViewModelFlowDocument flowReport                          flowReport  flowReport         PrepareDocumentForPrinting       private void PrepareDocumentForPrinting              DocumentPaginatorEx paginator  new DocumentPaginatorExflowReport, new System.Windows.Size816, 1344, new PageRange  paginate to legal size         Package package  Package.Opennew MemoryStream, FileMode.Create, FileAccess.ReadWrite         Uri packageURI  new Uripacktemp.xps         PackageStore.RemovePackagepackageURI         PackageStore.AddPackagepackageURI, package         XpsDocument xpsDocument  new XpsDocumentpackage, CompressionOption.NotCompressed, packageURI.ToString                     XpsDocumentWriter xpsWriter  XpsDocument.CreateXpsDocumentWriterxpsDocument                     xpsWriter.Writepaginator           this is binded to DocumentViewer.Document DependencyProperty in PrintReportView         ReportDocument  xpsDocument.GetFixedDocumentSequence.References[0].GetDocumenttrue      codepre  pstrongPrintReportViewstrongp  precodeltGridgt     ltDocumentViewer DocumentBinding ReportDocument gt ltGridgt codepre  pAs I said previously, there are no issues with the actual print of the report.

Negative 869 pThis is a weird problem that Im trying to figure out.  I use WAMP to build WordPress sites locally.  All of my sites work fine except the main one I am working on now.  I am using Chrome on Windows 7 but it happens on any browser.  Basically all of the sudden when i go to codelocalhostmysitewpadmincode the login screen comes up and when I type in my username and password and hit enter its basically like the page refreshes and my login info has to be reentered.  This will repeat infinity for the most part.  First time this happened it took about 10 tries and then it logged in.  It still happens daily and I found somewhat of a weird solution.  Basically I have to go to the sites front end codelocalhostmysitecode and load that up.  Once its up I then add codewpadmincode to the URL, hit enter and when I login again it usually works.  Not 100 but this has been the only way to log on as of now.  Anyone experience this  Like I said all my other sites do not have this problem.  What can be causing this  A plugin perhaps  Its just a weird problem and I dont like the solution Im using. Thanks.p

Negative 869 pI am new to mvc I need help to bind a different model to the view from what was originally sent to the view.p  pLet me explain it furtherp  pI have a Model like thisp  precodeusing System using System.Collections.Generic using System.Linq  using System.Text using System.Threading.Tasks using UI.Data.Models.Claim.Shared.CustomerInfo  namespace UI.Data.Models.Claim      public abstract class CreateClaimViewmodel       public DateTime CreatedDate  get set      public UserFirstName UFname  get set               public Customer Customer  get set     public CustomerAddress CustProvidedAddress  get set         public ListltTransactions.Transactiongt Transactions  get set      public DiscrepancyType discreType get set      public ListltIDiscrepancygt discrepancy   get set   assumption    codepre  pp  pI have noted Idiscrepancy as an interface as this might be a different child class based on what the user selects on this view. So when the user selects a discrepancy type from one of the dropdown list values a partial view pops up which has corresponding questions for that discrepancy type. All these discrepancy types point to different Models partial views in my applicationp  precode public enum DiscrepancyType              WithdrawalError,         DepositError,         CancelDetails,         CanceledServiceSubscTransac,         DuplicateTransaction,         ChargedInsteadOfCredit,         CreditNotReceived,         DefectiveMerchantdise,         DifferentAuthorizedAmount,         GoodsServicesNotReceived,         MerchandiseReturned,         NotAsDescribed,         PaidByAnotherMethod,         TransacNotRecognized,         UnauthorizedTransaction,  many more        codepre  pHere comes my questionp  pThe part works fine where I want to display a partial view based on the drop down. But I understand now when I post it back to the controller , the new object of type that has been added to the View  of Idiscrepancy property based on the users selection from a drop down is not bind to the Model as the Model doesnt exist anymore.  How do I tell my controller that use this new model instead of the Old one p  pI tried using Jquery , but for each partial view I need to write  different jquery code and also create json objects . Is there an efficient way where I can tell my controller that I am posting a view with the same model , but an added object of type  . There are 24 classes of that use implement idiscrepancy. p  pAnother option that I thought was using a model Dynamic , but I am not really sure if that would help my scenariop  pI understand this is pretty common at many companies and I wonder why there is not much documentation about dynamically changing models based on user input.p  pPlease apologize if my terms are incorrect as I am still trying to get out of webforms thinking.p  pThanks in advancep

Negative 869 pstrongProblemstrongp  pI have read that the Leap motion sensor is supposed to be capable of 0.01 mm measurements of hand gestures.  I dont see how that is possible if the depth images are only 8bit images 256 values at 0.01 mm per value would only yield like an inch of measurement range, which is clearly not the case.  Ive read through the API for the Leap Motion sensor, I dont see any configurable settings that would yield, say, a 16bit depth image, which I would expect from a sensor claiming 0.01 mm measurements see a hrefhttpwww.extremetech.comcomputing129638theleapgesturecontrollikekinectbutcheaperandmuchhigherresolution relnofollowthis sitea for that claim.  strongDoes anybody know a way to increase the bitdepth of the depth images from the Leap Motion sensorstrongp  pstrongContext of problemstrongp  pI am trying to use a Leap Motion sensor as a cheap 3D scanner.  I want to measure the position and tilt of a 3D printer head with it.  I think I can fake better resolution by analyzing many points across the surface, but if it is possible to get 16 bit resolution of the depth image, I would much prefer that.p  pI am not against using a different sensor if that is whats called for, but I am aware of other SO questions in that vein.p
