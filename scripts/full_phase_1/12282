Positive 12282 pI have a series of topographic profile scans that I would like to combine to create a single continuous profile. The only issue is that each scan may or may not have been taken from a different height, so while the different files have a fair amount of overlap in terms of the area covered, the different data may not have a common reference point in terms of absolute height. p  pBelow are 4 different scans. Each scan contains approximately 30  measurements, with the last few measurements representing new data, and the rest being overlap with the previous scan. The first scan contains the only known absolute values, so the first scan is the gold standard. The second scan happens to be taken from the same height, so the overlap matches up almost perfectly and only adds 4 new points to the previous scan. The third and fourth scans are taken from different heights, so while the overlap covers the same area relatively, I can not simply stitch it onto the previous two scans. p  precode   Scan1ltc5,6,7,8,15,16,18,20,25,23,20,17,15,10,10,9,8,9,11,10,13,16,17,19,20,25,28,30,29,30    Scan2ltc15,16,18,20,25,23,20,16,15,10,10,9,8,9,11,10,13,16,17,19,20,25,28,30,29,30,32,35,38,37    Scan3ltc28,25,23,18,18,17,16,17,19,18,21,23,25,27,26,33,36,37,37,38,40,43,46,45,43,42,40,38,32,30    Scan4ltc27,30,29,36,39,39,40,41,43,46,49,48,46,45,43,41,35,33,30,29,28,30,31,32,35 codepre  pUsing R, is there a way to stitch these 4 scans together to make a continuous topographic profile The absolute height would need to be based off of the first scan, with each successive scan being stitched onto the previous scan. IE Scan2 is stitched onto Scan 1 adding 4 data points, then the new data from Scan 3 is added onto to the combination of Scan1 and Scan2, then the new data from Scan4 is added onto the combination of Scans 1,2, and 3, and so on....p  pIm assuming there is a way to normalize all the data by matching up the large overlap between scans, using some sort of pattern recognition to figure out that Scan3 is about 8 units different from Scan1, and that Scan4 is about 11 units off. But please note there is some noise in my data and the pattern of overlap will not be a perfect fit.p  pThe end result should contain a complete topographic profile encompassing all 4 scans, with some sort of adjustments for when the actual numbers differ.

Positive 12282 pIve scoured the web and havent found any good examples for doing pattern scans of a byte array.

Id like to use the same method of including a match parameter. I started on it, as you can see match exists as a paramater, but it doesnt do anything. The unsafe code is very confusing and after a few hours of sitting in a debugger trying to figure out what its doing, Im completely at a loss.p  pIm guessing theres an easy way to have it check the index of the current byte its matching and if its a  in the match to allow it to pass even if it doesnt match, then it goes to the next byte and if it is an x in the match it continues searching on. If it finds a byte array that completely matches up with the match then it returns. p  pAny help on this would be greatly appreciated. p

This is obviously not perfect.p  pI have considered the following alternativep  ul lipPutting everything in one rule. This is in fact my favored solution. The problem is that one cannot add factsinstances on the LHS of a rule.

Yet this is necessary to correctly match codeireallycomplexcode.p  pI have thought of a selfmodifying rule which is calledmatched twice The first time it creates codeicomplexcode on the RHS.

Negative 12282 pWere reviewing some of our practices at work  and the specific thing were looking at right now is the best method for doing Comms with Flex based clients, and .NET web services. p  pOur typical approach is to first model the interactions based on requirements, mock up some XML messages and sanity check them, turn those into XSDs, and finally build classes on each end that serialize tofrom XML. p  pThis works okay until we hit the database and then things like Join Tables start mucking up all that work we did simplifying down the client end. p  pWeve tried solving this with LINQ to SQL and other OR mappers, but none of them really solve the problem without introducing more serious issues. p  pSo, the question really is strongWithout treating a RDBMS as simply an object store, is there a better way to handle complex data requirements without writing a huge amount of conversion codestrongp  pI suppose the magic bullet Im looking for is something that knows what a Join table is and how to deal with it, and still allows me to generate nice serialized XML for Flex and retains strong .NET Typing. p  pBonus points if it can analyse the SQL required for each method, generate stored procedures and use them.  But thats probably asking too much  p  pstrongNote re Join Tablesstrongp  pOur definition of this is where you have a table which has two or more foreign keys as its own primary key. p  peg p  precodePhotos PK PhotoID amplt PhotoTags PK FK PhotoID, PK FK TagID ampgt Tags PK TagID codepre  pWhen a Flex client gets a Photo object, it might also get a List of all Tags.

Negative 12282 pWe are mainting a web application that is built on Classic ASP using VBScript as the primary language. We are in agreement that our backend framework if you will is out dated and doesnt provide us with the proper tools to move forward in a quick manner. We have pretty much embraced the current webMVC pattern that is all over the place, and cannot do it, in a reasonable manner, with the current technology. The big missing features are proper dispatching and templating with inheritance, amongst others.p  pCurrently there are two paths being discussedp  ol liPort the existing application to Classic ASP using JScript, which will allow us to hopefully go from there to .NET MSJscript without too much trouble, and eventually end up on the .NET platform preferably the MVC stuff will be done by then, ASP.NET isnt much better than were we are on now, in our opinions. This has been argued as the safer path with less risk than the next option, albeit it might take slightly longer.li liCompletely rewrite the application using some other technology, right now the leader of the pack is Python WSGI with a custom framework, ORM, and a good templating solution. There is wiggle room here for even django and other prebuilt solutions. This method would hopefully be the quickest solution, as we would probably run a beta beside the actual product, but it does have the potential for a big waste of time if we cantdont get it right.li ol  pThis does not mean that our logic is gone, as what we have built over the years is fairly stable, as noted just difficult to deal with. It is built on SQL Server 2005 with heavy use of stored procedures and published on IIS 6, just for a little more background.p  pNow, the question. Has anyone taken either of the two paths above If so, was it successful, how could it have been better, etc. We arent looking to deviate much from doing one of those two things, but some suggestions or other solutions would potentially be helpful.p

Negative 12282 pIn a nutshell what my program does is it executes and takes user input periodically using nswindow which is controlled by my NSWindowController object and continues execution. p  phere is my myController.mm which is calling and showing the window to take user inputp  precodeEncryptPasswordDlgController encPassController  [[EncryptPasswordDlgController alloc] init]  [encPassController showWindowself] NSString inputPassword  [encPassController password] codepre  phere is my nswindowcontroller object codep  precodeimport EncryptPasswordDlgController.h  implementation EncryptPasswordDlgController id init      return self    IBActionshowWindowidsender      [super showWindowsender]     encryptPasswordDlgWindowController  [[NSWindowController alloc] initWithWindowNibNameEncryptionPasswordDlg]     [encryptPasswordDlgWindowController loadWindow]     [[self window] makeKeyAndOrderFront[self window]]      return   IBActionclickOKid sender      password  [passwordField stringValue]      NSLogpassword is , password       [[self window] close]     return   NSString password         return password   IBActionclickCancelid sender   close the window     password  nil     [[self window] close]     return  end codepre  pafter i click the ok or cancel button, the respective IBAction method is getting called and is getting executed as required i.e it is showing the window taking user input from text field and on clicking ok it is updating the password also. But after it finishes execution of IBAction clickOK method, it should return back to myController.mm and retrieve the password by executing the next statement NSString inputPassword  [encPassController password] which is not happening. Please can anone suggest a way to tackle this situation.p  pstrongEDITstrongp  pThanks Bob for the reply. I now understood what my mistake was.  So i tried the notification method by using a while loop as shownp  precodewhileisPasswordReceivedForEncryption  NO                 sleep10000             continue  codepre  pin the middle of my program so as to wait till the notification comes and sets the bool variable to true. But now the problem is that it is going into infinite loop and my applicaton is getting stuck.p  pis there nothing like the MFC equivalent where it directly waits for user input.  Really is it that difficult to create a window and get user input or am i really missing something over herep

Ive used FireBug to select the collection many answers below all select correctly but in slightly different ways. In firebug console resulting set isp  precode[ltTextNode textContentSome Label 1gt,  ltTextNode textContentSome Label 2gt,   ltTextNode textContentSome Label 3gt,   ltTextNode textContentSome Label 4gt,   ltTextNode textContentSome Label 5gt] codepre  pThe problem seems to be that calling .replaceWith, .replace, .text, etc. doesnt seem to affect the jquery collection. If I allow the above collection to contain one of the spans, then calling .replaceWith, .replace, etc functions correctly against the span, but the text nodes stay as is..p

Negative 12282 pSteve Jobs just posted this article on why Apple rejects Flash... a hrefhttpwww.apple.comhotnewsthoughtsonflash relnofollowhttpwww.apple.comhotnewsthoughtsonflashap  pI agree that javascript and css can be used to replicate some of Flashs animation, though Flash does all sorts of scaling and tweening that is incredibly powerful, and Im not sure that theres anything comparable in javascript, if there is, I certainly havent seen it.p  pHowever, my question is about the socket.  Flash has an incredibly powerful openSocket class that allows you to connect to a server and have the server and the client talk back and forth to one another.  As far as I know there is no equivalent class in Javascript. Am I mistaken Is there some secret mystery Ajax class that replicates the openSocket If not, then that feature alone makes Flash an invaluable tool.p  pIm interested in all answers though... and yes this IS a programming question p

Negative 12282 pThis is one of those seems obvious as how to do, but came across interesting side effect in implementing.  Im trying to keep two text boxes syncronized when information is updated.

Likewise, if the txtEndDate changes, I want the txtSartDate to be updated.

Negative 12282 pI have a checkbox on a .ascx file. This .ascx file is located within a closed source web application and something is preventing the checkchanged event from firing every other time.p  pWhen I first load the page and click the checkbox checking it the first time the checkchanged event is fired. If I click it the second time uncheck the checkchanged event isnt fired. If I check it again the event is fired and when i uncheck it again it doesnt fire and continues as so. If I set the checkboxs default value to be true, as it loads up, the same effect occurs only it fires when it is unchecked the first time and doesnt fire when it is checked the second time and so on.p  pThe page this .ascx is on has EnableViewState set to true as well as the .ascx and Ive even tried setting it on the checkbox itself. The checkbox has the AutoPostBack set to true as well.p  pIf I pull the .ascx file out of this application and put it on a test web application page it works as expected. I also better mention that the checkbox is inside of an update panel but that doesnt seem to be related because if I remove the update panel it still has the same adverse effect.p  pWhat within this application could be preventing the checkchanged event from firing every other timep

Negative 12282 pIm working on a large php site that currently does not use any framework.

Would it be a good idea to try and use ZF just to bootstrap the app and get all this common code into one place Or is adding a framework into the mix going to cause more headaches than its worth at this pointp
Negative 12282 pIm facing a possible problem with DDK a quite old version 3590 for WinXP 32 bit. My driver contains some static variables not inizialized they should be assigned to .bss section, I suppose and some functions in a pageable code section marked with pragma allocpagePAGE, func. The pageable code is collected in a separate object file. I have discovered that the linker seems to assign the statics and the pageable code to the same page in the kernel address space i.e. the variable is at 0xEFFCB0A0 and the function is at 0xEFFCB600  verified with windbg. The static variables are used in an interrupt environment, so their pages must be locked in memory. But if the same page contains swappable code I am afraid the variables can suddenly disappear. The linkers map reports correctly that the pageable code is in a different section PAGE, but the offset RvaBase is in the middle of a page that contains the statics.p  pHow can I force the linkerloader to assign separate pages to the pageable code Is there some pragma to force the section alignment attibute Am I doing something wrongp  pPS The driver loader is surely smart enough to put the page containg both variables and code out of the paged pool, but since the page contains variables it must be writable. Id prefer that the executable code was in a readonly page. Wrong array accesses in kernel mode are yet so difficult to debug...p  pPPS Added 4096 nops before and after my function... ok, it works... nothing better to suggestp

Negative 12282 pI have a WCF selfhosted service with a net.tcp DuplexChannel. On the server I run the following to disconnect a clientp  precodeICommunicationObjectclient.CallbackChannel.Close codepre  pThis works fine but how do I detect on the client that it has been disconnectedp  pIve hooked up to Closed and Faultedevents on both the InstanceContext of the callback and the channel to the serverp  precodeInstanceContext callback  new InstanceContextcallbackImp callback.Closed  new EventHandlercallbackClosed codepre  pandp  precodeICommunicationObjectChannel.Closed  new EventHandlerChannelClosed codepre  pBut nothing works. I never get notified. The workaround Im using now is to have a method in the callback that triggers a disconnect from the clientside instead. But I rather not do it this way. I especially dont want to let the server wait for a user to disconnect.p  pstrongEDITstrongp  pI just realized that when disconnecting from clientside I run a method in the servicecontract which is marked with IsTerminating  truep  precode[OperationContractIsTerminating  true] void Disconnect codepre  pI figured it would be the same on the callbackcontract then I tried adding the same method to my callback and it did terminate the callbackchannel from the server point of view but I still didnt got notified on the clientside...weirdp  pstrongEDITstrongp  pI found out some more info about thisp  blockquote   pWhen the server aborts the callback   channel, a fault travels back to the   client, the client faults and we get   the Faulted event on the client.p      pWhen the server closes the callback   channel, the session is still open   until the client issues the close.p      pOnce the client closes the channel   youll see the Closed event.p blockquote  pAccording to this statement the Closeevent is not triggered mearly by closing the callbackchannel from the server, the client has to close it as well. So I could run Close on the client in the terminating Disconnectmethod of the callback. Or I could use the Abortmethod on the callback serverside and skip using a Disconnectmethod on the callback. I dont know which one I preffer honestly. Hmmmm.p  pstrongEDITstrongp  pI went with the Abortapproach. It seemed like the most logical method and it works really well. The client gets notified with the Faultedevent on the callbackinstancecontext. Nice.p

Negative 12282 pI like the using statement for its control of scope and for readability. Not only can you create objects, use them and dispose them neatly, but you can also use it like thisp  pSuppose myInstance is an instance of MyClass from some other place in code  ie a method parameter or somethingp  precodeusing var t  myInstance      t.Foo Hello     t.Bar World     ...  codepre  pDefinition of MyClassp  precodepublic class MyClass  IDisposable     public string Foo get set    public string Bar get set    ...     public void Dispose   codepre  pThis makes code neater and more readable I feel and certainly easier to type. However in order to use this widely you have to implement IDisposable. In this case theres no need for MyClass actually handle anything in Dispose, so its empty.p  pstrongMy question is, is there any drawback to using IDisposable in this waystrongp  pI appreciate that there are similar questions already on SO, but I dont think these deal with using IDispose for this purpose or they refer to specific classes.p  pstrongEDITstrongp  pOK, so I guess I was being a bit specifc, but theres a wider point here. The using statement is a handy, very neat way to define an instance for a specific length of time, and then you can forget about it. Its seems unfair that this ability should be restricted to IDisposable objects only.  Yes theres a certain amount of laziness in not just instancing and then setting to null, but the using block makes it very specific what the instances scope is. strongWhy shouldnt I be allowed to do it with non IDisposable classesstrongp

Negative 12282 pIm hoping I can get some advice.p  pI have accounting ledgers in my PHPMySQL system, with invoices that hit the ledger at intervals for this example, lets just say once a month.  I also have late fees that need to be applied after a certain date.  The posting date of the invoice, as well as the this is late date are in the DB already.p  pIm wondering which is a better method to run my script which applies a ledger item automatically once a month  and enters a late fee automatically will also be once a month, if needed.  For all users of the system, these dates are different  and like I said, all stored in the DB.  My options as I see it arep  ul lipHave a CRON job that runs once a day i.e. 1200am each day  and goes through every item, doing work if the date conditions are met.p  pI think I like this method, because it takes care of everything all at once, at the same time every day.p  pI am worried about this method because 1 what if my server is down when my CRON job was scheduled, does CPANEL completely skip that day now  And 2 if I have 100k or even 100Million entries to sift through, will this be an unbearable load on my server whenever this is ranpli lipCall this script to do work if date conditions are met, strongonlystrong when that related user logs in.  p  pThe reason why I dont like this method as much, is because it gets increasingly complex to tell how many invoices to apply, and how many late fees to apply.  Further, I have an administrator user who can see EVERYTHING from EVERYONE  that user may have strongnot up to date ledger infostrong if the tenant hasnt logged in recently enough...p  pThe reasn I do like this method, is because it obviously is a less load on the server...pli ul  pPerhaps Im over thinking things.

Negative 12282 pI have been looking for a javascript hopefully jQuery timezone chooserpickercontrol widget that I can include in my socialcalendareventrouter web app. p  pGiven that there are approximately 400 cities listed in the usual dropdown menus, I was hoping that someone had taken pity on the poor user and had come with a nice UI widget with a better interface before I create one myself. I have seen some nice web site examples that use a map to allow for a time zone choice, but they take up too much real estate on the page for my app.p  pWhile there are several ways to list timezones other than just by GMT offset, I think that the best way to organize timezones is to use a hierarchical dropdown menu with sub menus. Then I would list by continent, then submenus to list both country and major cities and perhaps cityregion exceptions that dont follow the geographical or daylight savings time rule. i.e Arizona in MST and some cities in Indiana in CST. p  pIncluded in the widget would be the ability to remember the users last 5 choices and present  these at the top of the list. p  pThe widget would also allow the user to type using autosuggest which will consider the user input as a prefix, suffix and at any other location in the query. which in SQL terms is an equivalent to saying WHERE somecolumnname LIKE query. Their typing would present a reduced set of choices making the list to choose from much shorter. i.e. CST would present the several timezones that use CST as their abbreviation, 7 would present a list of cities that had their current timezone set to GMT7, 5.5 would list the country of Inida, etc. p  pIf someone knows of a widget that comes close to matching this, would be curious know where they are getting their timezone and DST data, since there are several sources and the data is always being updated.p

Negative 12282 pI want to install postgresql for use as the backend to a Windows application.p  pThis seems to be no problem if postgresql is not already installed on the system.p  pIf postgresql is already installed then unless the command line parameters contain the superpassword etc of the existing installation then the install fails.  As I will likely never know the superpassword or other account details of any preexisting postgresql instances and the machine owners may not either it seems that this will frustrate any attempt to install postgresql in such a situation.p  pI believe it is possible to install completely independent instances of sql server but is this possible for postgresqlp  pstrongBTWstrong  If the command line does contain the correct superpassword then the install just seems to overwrite the existing install and ignores parameters like prefix etc .

Negative 12282 pRecently, I have been reading Database Management Systems Raghu Ramakrishnan and Johannes Gehrke.

In case, it wont be written as one page, what method do I have to adopt Thanks alotp
Negative 12282 pIm making a PDF reader that looks like a real book.p  pI have a UIImageView inside a scrollview as the books background imagine an open book with empty pages.  The UIImageViews layer has 2 sublayers each positioned over each page, CATiledLayers that render PDF content.p  pI have 2 UIViews whose layer uses an image as its contents.  When I hit a button to turn the page, I take the CATiledLayer attached to the background and remove him but then add him to the UIViews layer as a sublayer.  This UIViews layer animates a page turning, and with it animates that PDF page.  I create a new PDF page and put it where the old one used to be.p  pSo now there is a PDF page as a sublayer on the background UIImageView, and a UIView overtop of that with a PDF page as a sublayer.  For some reason the PDF on the page underneath is visible during the animation.  It should not be visible because the turning page should be obstructing it.  Question is, why is that happeningp

Negative 12282 pI have a simple WPF application Im working on, which performs a SQL query and displays the resulting data in a DataGrid.p  pEverything works as expected, except that performance is terrible. The length of time from clicking a button to load data, and actually seeing the data show up in the DataGrid, is on the order of 34 seconds. It is a good bit faster with row virtualization turned on, but Ive had to turn it off since I need to be able to perform operations on cells that are no longer visible after scrolling. And even with virtualization turned on, getting the data displayed is slower than I would like.p  pI first assumed it was the SQL database that was being slow, but I did some tests and found that Im reading all data from the SQL server several hundred rows into a DataTable in a fraction of a second. It isnt until I bind the DataTable to the DataGrids DataContext that everything locks up for several seconds.p  pSo why is the DataContext so slow My computer is brand new, so I have a hard time understanding why it takes any length of time to fill out the DataGrid, considering how quickly I retrieve the data in the first place.p  pI also tried binding to the DataGrids ItemSource rather than the DataContext, but performance was the same.p  pIs there an alternative method of loading data into a DataGrid that has more reasonable performance Even an alternative to DataGrid might be worth exploring if needed.p  hr  pstrongEditstrong At Vlads suggestion, I tried another test which bypassed the SQL query. I instead filled the DataTable with 1000 rows of random generated data. No change. The data was generated and written to the DataTable in under a second. However, attaching that to the DataGrid took over 20 seconds.p  pBelow is the DataGrid XAML Im using. Other than the binding, it is very simple, no custom code attached to it.p  precodeltDataGrid ItemsSourceBinding AutoGenerateColumnsFalse NamedataGridWellReadings GridLinesVisibilityNone CanUserResizeRowsFalse SelectionUnitCell AlternatingRowBackgroundFFE0E0E0 RowBackgroundFFF0F0F0 HorizontalScrollBarVisibilityDisabled SelectedCellsChangeddataGridWellReadingsSelectedCellsChanged EnableRowVirtualizationFalsegt     ltDataGrid.Columnsgt         ltDataGridTextColumn HeaderDate BindingBinding readingDate, StringFormatyyyyMMdd Width3gt             ltDataGridTextColumn.CellStylegt                 ltStyle TargetTypeDataGridCellgt                     ltSetter PropertyKeyboardNavigation.IsTabStop ValueFalse gt                     ltSetter PropertyBorderThickness Value0gt                 ltStylegt             ltDataGridTextColumn.CellStylegt         ltDataGridTextColumngt         ltDataGridTextColumn HeaderPt BindingBinding readingPt, StringFormat0.

Negative 12282 pIm working on an app that has a Main view that wants to spawn a child view when a button is touched. So when I receive the button event, the MainViewController spawns the child view by calling initWithNibName and storing the ChildViewController in an ivar. I then show the ChildView by attaching an animation and setting childVC.view.hidden  NO.p  pThis works, but I noticed that the ChildViewController was never getting released after closing the ChildView. I realized that the ChildVCs retain count went from 1 to 2 when I first access the child view. So something in the nib loading guts appears to be retaining my ChildVC again in addition to the initial retain I expect during object initialization.p  pCan somebody help me figure out why the ChildVC is getting retained the extra time, and how can I make sure that it gets fully released when I want to close the child viewp  pEdit heres some code, only slightly simplified.

Negative 12282 pIm working on a QtC project, and one of its functions is setting up a MySQL database. That particular bit of code works fine, but one of the things that the user must provide to make it work  is the port that the MySQL process is currently listening on.  This is usually 3306 or 5432, depending on OS... MySQL usually wants to use 3306 first but Ive had it try to use the Postgres port on one occasion but I feel like I need to account for strange configurations. Many users will have no idea what to put in that field unless they know enough about MySQL to know what ports it uses. most people dont My target audience for the program is everyone who might want to keep a computerized diary, so it would be nice if the program can find the correct port on its own.  p  pI could have the program run through a list of commonlyused ports until it finds the right one, which should work in most setups but it would be better if it could actually figure out which port to use. That way, there wont be any problems if the user has a bizarre configuration for some reason. p  pAny idea how I would go about doing this Ive tried googling and I found nothing relevant. p

Negative 12282 pI need to create a simple richtext editor that saves its contents to an XML file using arbitrary markup to indicate special text styles e.g code[b]...[b]code for strongboldstrong and code[i]...[i]code for emitalicem. All the backend PHP stuff seems fairly straightforward, but the frontend WYSIWYG portion of the feature seems a bit more convoluted. Ive been reticent to use one of the currentlyavailable JavaScriptbased WYSIWYG editors because the richtext options I want to allow are so limited, and these applications are so fullyfeatured that it almost seems like more work to stip them down to the functions I need.p  pSo, in setting out to create a barebones richtext editor, Ive encountered three approaches p  ul liThe first two approaches use the codecontentEditablecode or codedesignModecode properties to create an editable element, and the codeexecCommandcode method to apply new text styles to a selected range.  ul liThe first option uses a standard codedivcode element, executes all styling commands on that elements contents.li liThe second option uses the editible codebodycode of a window enclosed in an codeiframecode, then passes any styling commands initiated from buttons in the parent document into its codecontentWindowcode to alter selected ranges in the contained body. This seems like several extra steps to accomplish the same effect as option one, but I suppose the isolation of the editable content in its own document has its advantages.li ulli liThe third option uses a codetextareacode overlaying a codedivcode, and uses the codeoninputcode JS event to update the background divs codeinnerHTMLcode to match the input textareas codevaluecode whenever it changes. Obviously, this requires some string finagling to to convert elements like codenewlinecode characters in the textarea to codeltbrgtcode in the div, but this would allow me to preserve the integrity of my code[]code markup, while relegating the potentiallymessy DOM manipulation to frontend display only.li ul  pI can see benefits and drawbacks for each method. the codecontentEditablecode solutions seem initially the simplest, but support for this features tends to vary across browsers, and each browser that DOES support it seems to manipulate the DOM differently when implementing codeexecCommandcode. As mentioned before, the textareadiv solution seems like the best way to preserve my arbitrary styling conventions, but the custom stringmanipulation procedure to display rich text in the output div could get pretty hairy.p  pSo, I submit to you my question Given the development goals Ive outlined, strongwhich method would you choose, and whystrong And of course, if theres another method Im overlooking that might better serve my purpose, please enlighten mep  pThanks in advancep

Two of these tables are populated with data and the other two are empty before the program executes.p  pThe program basically performs some queries on the two tables which are populated, processes the results then writes those results to the two tables which are empty when the program is executed. There are a number of methods which read and write to the db.

I can stop it from Eclipse, but as soon as I try and start it again I get the CREDENTIALERROR.

Just after posting this, I stumbled upon this link... a hrefhttpjava.netjirabrowseGLASSFISHPLUGINS72 relnofollowhttpjava.netjirabrowseGLASSFISHPLUGINS72a ...which suggested that the AntiVirus not the firewall being the culprit and lo and behold, it was.

Negative 12282 pThis is a description of how to create a helper method in Rspec taken from the Rspec book page 149.  This example assumes that there is a method called setstatus which is triggered when the Thing object is created.p  pBoth sets of code create a new Thing object, set the status, then do fancystuff.  The first set of code is perfect clear to me.  One of the it statements it triggered, which then calls the creatething method with options.  A new Thing object is created and the setstatus method is called with the options attribute as the parameter.p  pThe second set of code is similar.  One of the it statements is triggered, which then calls the giventhingwith method while passing status hash assignment as a parameter.  Within the giventhingwith method the yield is triggered taking the Thing.new as a parameter.  This is where I am having trouble.  When I try to run this code I get an error of block given to yield.  I understand that whatever attributes that are passed by yield will be returned to the thing in pipe brace from the it statement that called the giventhingwith method.  I can get the newp  pWhat I dont understand is why the code block is not called in the giventhingwith method after the yield command.  In other words, I cant code in that block to run.p  pThanks in advance for your help.p  pThe remainder of this question is quoted directly from the Rspec bookp  precodedescribe Thing do   def createthingoptions     thing  Thing.new     thing.setstatusoptions[status]     thing   end    it should do something when ok do     thing  createthingstatus gt ok     thing.dofancystuff1, true, move gt left, obstacles gt nil     ...   end    it should do something else when not so good do     thing  createthingstatus gt not so good     thing.dofancystuff1, true, move gt left, obstacles gt nil     ...   end end codepre  pOne idiom you can apply to clean this up even more is to yield self from initializers in your objects.  Assuming that Things initialize method does this and setstatus does as well, you can write the previous like thisp  precodedescribe Thing do   def giventhingwithoptions     yield Thing.new do thing        thing.setstatusoptions[status]     end   end    it should do something when ok do     giventhingwithstatus gt ok do thing       thing.dofancystuff1, true, move gt left, obstacles gt nil       ...      end   end    it should do something else when not so good do     giventhingwithstatus gt not so good do thing       thing.dofancystuff1, true, move gt left, obstacles gt nil       ...      end   end end codepre

Negative 12282 pNow before you shoot me for bringing up a duplicate question on SOF, let me first acquaint you with exactly what Im looking for, and I will address other questions and answers and why it is insufficient.p  pstrongQuestion 1strongp  pIm looking for a way to perform live collaborative edits, while the source is maintained on a centralized source control server. For example, if Me and Joe Blow are editing file codeX.cscode at the same time, we should be able to see eachothers edits as we type. Almost as if we were sitting together at the same computer. Now take the following scenario Me and Joe go offline, and Nimha Smith decides she wants to update some code. When I come back online the following day, I get pushed the code that Nimha updated while I was sleepingaway from the server. p  pThis is a combination of the idea of live collaboration, and a source control system like SVN, etc.p  pstrongAddressing of the possible duplicatesstrongp  pThere was a similar question, here a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions2302744collaborativeeditingfornetdevelopmentwhatarethepossibilitiesCollaborative editing for .NET development  what are the possibilitiesa, however it does not give me anything useful and Ill explain whyp  ul lia hrefhttpwww.vsanywhere.comVsAnywherea It runs through a central public server right direction.. except all parties involved need to have the exact same code on their machine before joining a session, and once you go offline the session is destroyed.li lia hrefhttpwww.sourcemeet.comSourceMeeta Runs with a P2P system, so no server to keep track of changes while offline etc. Have not tried it, so I can not attest to how well it can merge code if it can at allli lia hrefhttpcollabedit.comCollabEdita Not VisualStudioli lia hrefhttpci.ioCloud 9a Not VisualStudioli ul  pAnd there is obviously a hrefhttpprogrammers.stackexchange.comquestions940whatareyourfavoriteversioncontrolsystemsthis questiona and a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions4682254collaborativecodingnetthis onea that are questions directly about source control software such as SVN or GIT.

Negative 12282 pMy company is creating multiple web applications that will have some overlap in functionality.  I want to develop the common functions a separate project, and since it would consist of web pages and managed beans I would assume the project would need to be in its own .war file.  I would then presumably deploy the two or more web applications inside of a .ear file.  Doing some preliminary research online has left me unsure of how well the web applications would work together.  Would I be able to share data between the managed beans and direct the user from pages inside of one web application to another  Is the the proper approach to making my application maintainable or is there some better way to break up the projectp

Negative 12282 pIm currently looking at custom developed Web App Solution that is experiencing performance issues re month end and batch file uploads CSV files.p  pThe application which is a .NET 3.5 MVC 1.0 Web App has a file upload feature for users to do month end batch uploads along with day to day CRUD activities, the Web App is freezing on Users whilst they do the upload and its taking a considerable amount of time to process not to mention data validation errors and batch fails.p  pThe file size is growing considerably, from 50K to 500K rows per file per month end total of 20 separate files.p  pIm looking for ideas on how best to solve this, my initial gut feeling is that the file upload, data validation and ETL should be done via SSIS and abstracted away from the Web App completely, the remote users could upload the file to a Secure FTP location, have an SSIS package, pick up the file, process it Staging DB if necessary, approval process and then move it over to the Application specific DB SQL Server 2008 R2.p  pMy client is looking for a redesign, I want to explore both a DB option and any other Web Options, we can move to MVC3 and .NET 4.0 during the solution redesign, batch file processing like this via Web Apps and C is wrong IMO. I could be wrongp  pThoughtsp  pCheersp

However, that page uses list.php as a right side frame that loads a list of players. p  pstrongWhat happens isstrong, when the user clicks on a player on the field main.php, lets say on the image of the Goal Keeper GK, a list of GKs from world wide teams will load in right list fram list.php. This is by using ajax. p  pSo far we are good. p  pstrongThe current situation isstrong, when session times out and the user clicks on a player from the field, the list on the right does not load, instead, list of players disappears from the list and a message says Please login is displayed on the right side frame list.phpp  pstrongThe objective isstrong, when session times out I want the whole website to redirect to the main page index.phpp  pstrongThe problem isstrong, I already put the redirecting code just before the code that is responsible of displaying the message Please login. But what happened is, the redirection happens from within the frame, so i ended up having main.php displaying the field, and list.php displaying the main pagep  pHeres the code I added. p  precodeuserid  NSessiongetuserid  if issetuserid          NSessionremoveall                  GeneralRedirectindex.php  codepre  pThey are using Smarty. and btw, I added the same code to top of main.php, and now if user tries to access main.php without logging in, it will redirect him to the main page, so the code worksp  pn.b. The project is not mine, it belongs to the company I work in.  And I dont know which code is checking the session, all what I know is, if the user click on a player from the field after the session timeout, the Please Login message will be shown in the frame.p

Negative 12282 pI have a fairly straightforward SSIS package where I cant sucessfully pass the value of a packagescoped variable from the Control Flow to a Data Flow task.  Consider the below diagramp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comNrFVH.jpg altControl Flowp  pThe Execute SQL task gets values from a list of machines.  This is used to control a ForEach Loop Container, which works very well.  Next a script task performs some math and assigns a single number to a package scoped variable integer type.  I have added message boxes that pop up during the loop so that I can verify that the value of this variable is being set properly.p  pThe last icon is a data flow where I want to use the variable value.  I have a simple script task that contains just a message box showing me the current value of this same variable.  Every time, the variable is the value that I initially set in the designer BIDS.  Therefore, the value is not being passed to the data flow.  I have verified multiple times that the names of the variables are correct including case sensitive values.p  pThis should be pretty simple, and I am getting frustrated with this issue.  I would greatly appreciate and suggestions or comments.  Thank youp

Negative 12282 pI have a webforms project and Im using the new Model Binding on ASP.NET 4.5. I have a strongly typed FormView on my page that contains a DropDownList that will allow the user to select a related entity think Product  Category.p  pIs there a way to set this up so that, on my InsertMethod, I can get direct access to the related entity Product.Category, for example I need to check some validation rules on the related entities, and the only way I found to do that was to set up my DropDownList to return the Id of the related record, and then fetch it from the database. That seems rather inefficient.p  pEdit Damn, no one huh Well, thats what you get for being an early adopter of new technologies Dp

Negative 12282 pI have some data represented as multidimensional arrays. I would like to embed these data into my OO application and provide extra functionality to these data but also a way to access it both with the traditional random access and using an iterator so I could use foreach. In other words strongI would like to implement a wrapping class for a multidimensional arraystrong.p  pWhat I already triedp  pstrongI. ArrayAccessstrong The problem with this one is that the server uses PHP 5.2.17 and codeampoffsetGetcode gives an error, thus I cant return by reference, which means I cant implement multidimensional element accessp  precodeobj[key1][key2]  value codepre  pNote, that upgrading to a newer PHP version is currently not an optionp  pstrongII. Using magic methodsstrong This is a bit trickier, but my problems rose when I tried using a variable as key. E.g.p  precodeobjgtkey1[key2]  value codepre  pThe interpreter first evaluated codekey1[key2]code throwing a notice and returning the first char of key1, and uses that as key on my array. I dont know how to solve this one either. I thought of using brackets to force operation priority, but that had the same problem as in my next attemptp  pstrongIII. Using simple get and set functionsstrong Again, old PHP. It cries when I try to writep  precodeobjgtgetkey1[key2]  value codepre  pBecause it doesnt know how to index an expression ending in round brackets.p  pTheres still the lost resort option make the array public and forget OO all together.

Because of this the codeTextViewcode will split words having one piece on one line and the other piece on the next.

Negative 12282 pIm having a hard time getting my head around font scaling.p  pI currently have a hrefhttpwww.haselden.co.ukrttestindex.htmlthis sitea with a body codefontsizecode of 100. 100 of what though This seems to compute out at 16px. p  pI was under the impression that 100 would somehow refer to the size of the browser window, but apparently not because its always 16px whether the window is resized down to a mobile width or full blown widescreen desktop.p  pHow can I make the text on my site scale in relation to its container I tried using codeemcode but this doesnt scale either.p  pMy reasoning is that things like my menu become squished when you resize, so I need to reduce the px codefontsizecode of code.menuItemcode among other elements in relation to the width of the container. E.g in the menu on a large desktop, 22px works perfectly. Move down to tablet width and 16px is more appropriate.p  pIm aware I can add break points, but I really want the text to scale as WELL has having extra breakpoints, otherwise Ill end up with hundreds of breakpoints for every 100px decrease in width to control the text.p

The files are stored in a Core Data store and marked for needing to be uploaded, etc.p  pUsing GCD I have 3 network operations that are performed roundrobin  each triggers the next and the last triggers the process again  so only one is ever processing at once. There is 12 seconds of delay between each operation. One of these operations POSTs to see if the file should be uploaded. The next PUTs the file if needed. The last DELETEs any files that are marked for deletion. The PUT is my problem.p  pThe class method that handles the PUT is called on a newly created dispatch queue explicitly used for it viap  precodedispatchqueuet qput  dispatchqueuecreatecom.myapp.put, NULL dispatchafterdispatchtimeDISPATCHTIMENOW, NSECPERSEC  kPause, qput, void      autoreleasepool            PUTfilescompletionBlock        dispatchreleaseqput codepre  pThe method then creates an NSOperationQueue and an NSBlockOperation, adds it to the queue and lets it go. The NSBlockOperation is where all the work is. Basically this block gets a file url from Core Data and then creates the PUT via AFNetworking and queues it for upload. In detail, Im creating an NSURLRequest as a PUT with the file attached. An AFHTTPRequestOperation is then created and enqueueHTTPRequestOperation enqueues it.p  pUp to this point everything is good. The process actually runs fine for the most part. The problem comes in when NSURLRequest times out. After 60 seconds, if NSURLRequest times out AFNetworking tries to call the failure block in the AFHTTPRequestOperation but instead the app beach balls  other file processes in my app continue to run but AFNetworking is deadlocked  possibly waiting on a semaphore of sorts.

Note this only happens when NSURLRequest times out 60 seconds  other failures where the server actually responds are handled fine and no hang occurs. The process continues and tries again properly.p  pIm currently trying a watchdog block that gets called 45 seconds after a PUT begins and cancels the operation if it hasnt completed yet. When I set this to .25 seconds it works fine on the machine in question  cancels the operation and picks up to try again. Im hopeful that this solves the problem but having fought this bug for 2 weeks trying various things on this users machines build after build with log statements to try to track things down Im not holding my breath.

Negative 12282 pI have a rather large solution of C projects in Visual Studio. I want to port some of those projects to work in MONO and to run say on a MAC. Of course some things dont work and some things I dont want to port because they are not applicable on a MAC.p  pOne approach is Solution and Project Configurations. This allows me to exclude projects I dont want to build unfortunately Visual Studio does not make that easily visible but anyway.... p  pThe second approach which could work in tandem with the first is to use pre compiler directives such as if MONO and then do something at that point. This is good but then it creates multiple versions of the same assembly. How do I distinguish the two from each other post compile Is this a problemp  pEven if the top two approach work, sometimes I want part of a large project. I dont want to go through 20 or so files and put if MONO do I I can highjack the project file by hand but there is no visibility on that whatsoever in visual studio. No one else on the team can tell whats going on unless they unload the project and open the XML and take a look. This sounds quite crazy. To make things worse, sometimes the project references something and I want to exclude the reference for MONO. Now I have to edit the csproj.p  pI can split the project, but what if at some point I want to port to yet another platform. The intersections of which platform needs what code can get crazy. To make things worse, I can have projects referencing this large project which may then also have to split. This all works but it will cause project overload wont itp  pI cant find a good clean solution. Any tips Is there a standard for this I can follow. If VS had more visibility into the edits of the csproj file, this might work.p

Negative 12282 pAlright here is my issue.  I have a Pivot view.  Inside that pivot view a scroll viewer containing many stack panels and grids.  On some of the grids I have MouseButton Up Events.  What is happening is if I flick the scroll it scrolls as expected but when I release my finger most of the time it fires off the event from mousebutton up.  Because technically I let up.  The problem is these grids completely fill the screen so finding an area without a mousebutton up to scroll is near impossible.  What I want to happen is if the user flicked to scroll I would ideally like it to ignore the mousebutton up event.  It does this successfully sometimes but pretty rarely and I have noticed I have to flick pretty fast for it to work as expected.p  pAny ideas on how to prevent this activity.  I assume there is as Listboxes work perfect.p

Negative 12282 pI am trying to compile a large C code there are a few C files too on a Linux cluster, having run it for some time on a Mac compiled with g.  On the cluster, I have to use either gcc4.7.2 or intelicpc there is other software on the cluster that only works with those two compilers.  Im a newbie in dealing with compilinglinking problems, so no advicetips is too simple.p  pI posted a question here a couple of days ago about a problem with using gcc4.7.2.  I havent been able to resolve the problem, so now Im trying icpc.  Things have gone surprisingly well, but there is one problem I cant get past. p  pThe problem is that I am getting errors related to multiple definitions.  These are associated with what seems to be a virtual function in a class that is inherited.  I didnt write this code.  There is a base class Solver3, a derived class Solver2, and  another derived class Solver1.  The classes solve matrix equations.  I cant tell which function is the problem because the error output is quite cryptic see below I have no function called fileno and I cant find any generic definition of this term online.  But the problem function is probably SolveWithSolver2 because it is the only function in the Solver1 class.  I have no clue what could be wrong with it.p  pThis is a bit over my head in terms of C knowledge and it is likely Im making some beginners mistake.  For the past couple of days, I have used Google to search old forum posts.  I have tried renaming what seems to be the problem function, I have tried inlining it.  I get the same error. The code is very large and only a small part of it was written by me, so I cant post much of it.  I will post what seems relevant and can add things if that would be helpful. p  pHere are the kinds of the errors Im getting, starting from the first one I have not posted all of the outputp  blockquote   pcodelibrarieslibsolver.aSolver1.o In   function codefilenoIOFILE Solver1.cpp.text0x0 multiple   definition ofcodefilenoIOFILE main.omain.cpp.text0x1bc0   first defined herep      pcodelibrarieslibsolver.aSolver2.o In   function codefilenoIOFILE Solver2.cpp.text0x0 multiple   definition ofcodefilenoIOFILE main.omain.cpp.text0x1bc0   first defined here p      pcodelibrarieslibsolver.aSolver3.o    In function codefilenoIOFILE   Solver3.cpp.text0x0 multiple definition ofcodefilenoIOFILE   main.omain.cpp.text0x1bc0 first defined herep blockquote  p...

Negative 12282 pSometimes I am not sure when do I have to use one or another. I usually parse all sort of things with Python, but I would like to focus this question on HTML parsing.p  pPersonally I find DOM manipulation really useful when having to parse more than two regular elements i.e. title and body of a list of news, for example.p  pHowever, I found myself in situations where it is not clear for me to build a regex or try to get the desired value simply manipulating strings. A particular fictional example I have to get the total number of photos of an album, and the only way to get this is parsing the number of photos using this wayp  blockquote   p1 of 190p blockquote  pSo I have to get the 190 from the whole HTML document. I could write a regex for that, although regex for parsing HTML is not exactly the best, or that is what I always understood. On the other hand, using DOM seems overwhelming for me as it is just a simple element. String manipulation seems to be the best way, but I am not really sure if I should proceed like that in such a similar case.p  pCan you tell me how would you parse these kind of single elements from a HTML document using Python or any other languagep

Negative 12282 pI currently have a dll containing a TForm descendant that gets displayed when an exported function is called. The client applications have varying release cycles so this minimizes unnecessary changes to them when the dll has to change. There are well known problems with this approach stemming from dll and client apps having different instances of TApplication so I wont elaborate further. BPLs are the recommended solution to this problem but arent currently an option because the client applications are compiled in different versions of Delphi and Id like to keep the option open for reuse in a few nondelphi applications as well.p  pTo avoid these problems I am attempting to replace the dll with an ocx containing a self contained emActive Formem control that can be displayed in the client applications by dropping it onto a form either in a TOleContainer or as a wrapped control.p  pUsing the documentation and some tutorials I created an ocx project, active form and registered it. I then set about getting it into a test application. I had no problem getting the control to display in a TOleContainer but it wouldnt respond to mouse or keyboard actions. I thought it might be a limitation of TOleContainer so I imported the ocx using Import Component and dropped the resulting VCL component wrapper onto my form. Same result. No response to any mouse or keyboard actions. With the exception that rightclicking the control displays a Properties context menup  pIve read and reread the documentation and tutorials and dont see that Ive missed any steps.

But if you ignore whitespace, it becomes impossible to distinguish between the two selectors above at the parser level.p  pThen again, if you dont ignore whitespace, the grammar becomes pretty noisy with WS or WS patterns everywhere, since whitespace is emmostlyem meaningless unless it occurs within a selector.p  pWhich is where modes from antlr4 come in, because with support for lexer modes you can define new rules for the lexer whenever you enter different contexts i.e. emdontem ignore whitespace within the selector context.p  pThat said, Ill accept any grammar for antlr3 as well so long as it handles whitespaces properly, as thats the version were using now anyway p

Negative 12282 pI have a problem with UDF pig latin. Im trying to implement a system that must verify if there is a mapping between a matrix stored in local and a set of matrices stored in an hadoop repository. For mapping i mean if there exists a permutation of rows and columns of one stored matrix in hadoop that transform the matrix in a matrix equal to the one stored in local. Because the matrices can have hundreds of elements, I was thinking to execute the mapping algorithm on hadoop to use parallelism.

Negative 12282 pNot a Java expert  in fact, working on a legacy project that will lead to a new project. That said, currently attempting to create the old project and connect to the test database. I can connect fine directly through Netbeans Services panel or through SQLDeveloper.p  pThe server in use is currently Apache Tomcat 7.0.42.p  pThe Oracle JDBC driver is ojdbc7.jar  I know, very old, but for the sake of getting the connection through this file was included in the source.p  pThe Java platform is JDK 1.7, although thats the default for my copy of Netbeans  again, this is a very old project, I believe it was using DTD Web Application 2.3 so I may even be compiling with the wrong JDK, although Im only seeing depreciation and restricted warnings I should be able to ignore and they seem to lie more in the source packages and not in this aspect of the project.p  pThe project itself should have been working  I pulled it down through version control.p  pSince the source code contained no actual configuration for the JNDI I had to do my share of research used to just regular MySQL data base connections this world of JNDI is completely new to me.

Negative 12282 pas mentioned in the title, i have a big number of items in a hierarchical structure, i want to display them in a treeview control, besides the load time, at the start the performance

would be that the elements are loaded on demand when the parent elements are expanded, but not unloaded if they are contracted, but i do not have a sufficient knowledge of the background mechanics of

Negative 12282 pI want to use apache CXF to build my client. Unfortunately, I do not see a way by which it allows me to dispatch a client dynamically based on the port and operation name. If there is a huge wsdl, JaxWsDynamicClientFactory would create classes for all services contained in it which is an overhead that Id like to avoid.p  pI found a similar implementation in JAXWS. Is there any api in CXF that would do the samep

Negative 12282 pI just installed the newest version of g 4.8.1 and whenever I try to compile a file that has compilation errors, it only displays the first instance of an error and then terminates. Basically, if the file has 3 compilation errors, g will only display the first error and then say compilation terminated without displaying the other two errors. In previous versions, g would display all the compilation errors. Is there a way to force this version of g to print out all the compilation errors or is this just how the new g works I have the newest version of gcc installed as well and it also seems to have the same problem.p

Negative 12282 pI am attempting to create a custom camera for an Android application.  I have successfully gotten the camera with my own customer interface to take pictures, and save them.  The SurfaceView preview is displaying in Portrait mode which is desired as well.  My problem is that after the pictures are saved, they arent displayed in the orientation that the camera was in when the picture was taken.  I know there are a few questions very similar to mine on here, but they havent been able to assist me.  The phone that I am using for testing this outside of the emulator of course is an HTC Evo 4G.

I created a api with Google Cloud Endpoints. This endpoint exposes calls. The objects in the backend are mapped to json and mapped back to objects in the Android app. This is what the Endpoints provide. p  pSometimes I want to push information from the backend to the Android app. What I do now is I send a Google Cloud Message GCM to the Android app and these is updating everything by calling something on the Endpoint of the backend. p  pThis situation is working without problems but it has some drawbacksp  ul liWhen I update a lot of devices at ones what is happening a lot in my application all those devices make a call to the backend and creating a large peak load. li liThe extra call is using additional battery on the phones.li ul  pWhat I want is to add the updated information into the GCM. GCM has support to add 4kB of data. Large enough to add the json with the updated information. If I want to send more then 4kB I can always use the old situation.p  pSo, basicly what I want is the followingp  ul liWhen Im going to send a GCM I retrieve the the correct objects from datastoredatabase. li liThose objects needs to be converted to json in the same way as the Endpoint library does.li liThe json should be added to the GCM.li liIn the Android application the json should be convert back to objects in the same way as the Endpoint library does.li liContinue processing those object the same way as before.li ul  pI found a a hrefhttpscode.google.compgooglepluginforeclipseissuesdetailid216 relnofollowthreada that suggested that I should the gson library to do this. But I have problems in both backend and Android app. And also the json itself is not the same. I want to use the Endpoint library to serialize the same json and to deserialize to the same result as a Endpoint call. p  pDoes anybody have any idea how to do that Maybe a example or tutorialp

Negative 12282 pI have a list of clients page with an add button that pops up a bootstrap modal, allowing the user to enter details of a new client.p  pThe body of the modal is generated by a partial view, which is rendered as part of the list page initially.p  pWhen the user clicks add, the form is submitted to the server via an AJAX call. If there are model errors, then the server will respond by resending just the body of the modal with validation errors, which on the client side is injected back into the modal.p  pIm using codeHtml.ValidationSummarycode and codeHtml.ValidationMessageForcode in the usual way to add the model errors.p  pIf the user now clicks cancel, and then later clicks the add button again, the modal reappears. In this case, I want to treat it as a fresh start and clear all the validation errors from the body of the modal. I know how to clear the clientside unobtrusive validation errors, but how can I clear the errors added by codeHtml.ValidationSummarycode and codeHtml.ValidationMessageForcode.p  pI could go back to the server and ask it to rerender with a fresh model, but I guess Im looking for a shortcut that doesnt involve another AJAX call.p
Negative 12282 pWe are trying to sign a Windows 8.1 Store application with a corporate certificate obtained from Symantec. The certificate was originally ordered for Windows Phone 8 application signing, but the same certificate should work for Windows 8.1 apps also.p  pOn a fresh Hello World project, when we try to choose the certificate from the manifest designer in Visual Studio 2013, an error message is given The Manifest Designer could not import the certificate. The certificate you selected is not valid for signing because it is either expired or has another issue. For more information, see a hrefhttpgo.microsoft.comfwlinkLinkId241478 relnofollowhttpgo.microsoft.comfwlinkLinkId241478a. p  pThe certificate is most certainly not expired. On the another issue angle, a common suggestion for a possible cause for this issue was a publisher name mismatch between the certificate and the application, but that has been ruled out. If we skip some signing checks by adding a EnableSigningChecksfalse to the .csproj file, we can sign the app, but then another error is given by PowerShell when trying to install the application Error The certificate cant have the following extended key usage 2.16.840.1.113733.1.8.52.1. Only the Code Signing and Lifetime Signing EKUs are allowed. p  pWe asked for help on this issue from Symantec and Microsoft, but they didnt know how to help with this issue.p  pHas anybody encountered a similar issue with signing their apps Is there a solution to this problem p  pThis issue looks to be the same as in a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions22288410choosingacertificateforawindowsstoreapplicationviathepackageappxmanifChoosing a certificate for a Windows Store application via the package.appxmanifesta, where the solution was to get a new certificate.

Consumers may anticipate these trends. In particular, a consumer faces several options. The first is to buy the current level of technology at the current price. The second is not to buy and stick with the currently owned old level of technology. Hence, the consumer postpones the purchase and later on buys the same level of technology at a lower price, or better technology at the same price. We develop a new model to describe consumers92 decisions with respect to buying these products. Our model is built on the theory of consumer expectations of price and the wellknown utility maximizing framework. Since not every consumer responds the same, we allow for observed and unobserved consumer heterogeneity. We calibrate our model on a panel of several thousand consumers. We have information on the currently owned technology and on purchases in several categories of hightech durables. Our model provides new insights in these product markets and managerial implications.cell lastrowrow pardpardeftab720  f1fs24 cf0   codepre

Negative 12282 pMy problem is pretty straight forward. I have a client program written in Java which has a method that generates an ID. Im writing Python scripts to parse and correct the output of this client program. The method in the client that creates the IDs uses bitwise operations to create the ID. Unfortunately, the ID generator is unique though it says its UUID, its not.p  pThe code Im trying to convert is open source and in the EMF EcoreUtil.java filea hrefhttpgrepcode.comfilerepository.grepcode.comjavaeclipse.org4.2org.eclipse.emfecore2.8.0orgeclipseemfecoreutilEcoreUtil.javaEcoreUtil.generateUUID28byte5B5D29 relnofollow1a.

Negative 12282 pIn one of our C batch jobs, we use a dll that was built using the Entity Framewok 4.1. The batch job, however, also uses the EF same version and it looks like this might be causing some trouble. p  pIn both the dll and batch jobs code.edmxcode files is a relationship between the codeAgentTransmissioncode and codeAgentRelationshipCodescode table. codeAgentTransmissioncode has a onetomany relationship with codeAgentRelationshipCodescode. The PK of codeAgentTransmissioncode serves as a FK field on the codeAgentRelationshipCodescode table. p  pThe section of code below is from a routine in the dll. This method is called by the batch job to look for any record on the codeAgentTransmissioncode table with a status of codeWaitingcode or codeWcode. p  precodenamespace Botticelli      public class MonetToMainframe  IMonetToMainframe              private static TransmitAgents db          public ResponseMessage TransmitWaitingAgents                      try                              db  new TransmitAgents                  Exception thrown here                 agtTran  db.AgentTransmission.FirstOrDefaultw gt w.RecordStatus.EqualsW codepre  pWhen the last line above is run it hits the following exceptionp  precodeSchema specified is not valid.

Negative 12282 pI made some reports using SSRS and now I need to access them from a web site in another server. Im new to SSRS and I would like to know the best way to do this.p  pThis is my network structure, and my progress so farp  p1.SERVER01 has the web site which was coded using classic ASP. 2.The SSRS is in SERVER02 which is running SQL Server 2008 R2. 3.SERVER02 also has several databases, identical in structure, but each one belonging to a different customer. 4.In the web site on SERVER01 I have a page with an hyperlink to each report. 5.When I am login to my web site from a PC on my local network and I click on one of the report links, SERVER02 the SSRS server asks for my Windows username and password. After I enter them, I see the report and all works good. 6.But my customers are not on my local network, they login to the web site on SERVER01 via the internet. 7.When a customer logs in, a couple of session variables are filled with his user id and his targetdatabase each customer is able to access all reports, but can connect only to his database, so all the reports accept the target database name as a parameter. 8.But when they click on the reportlink, they are also presented with the dialog to enter a username and password.p  pSome questionsp  p1.How do I configure my reports so my customers who already logged in to my web site can access them without being asked for another usernamepassword which they dont have. 2.Is there a better way of passing the targetdatabase parameter Right now it is part of the reports URL. Maybe pass the session variable to the report and make a function that select database using the session values Is it possible It can affect the performancep  pThanks in advancep

Can anyone help me debug my errorsp  pHere is my Codep  precodeimport java.awt.event.  public class EmployeeGUI extends JFrame implements ActionListener     param args   JFrame frame JButton button1, button2, button3, button4 JTextField box1, box2, box3 JLabel label1, label2, label3 JTable table1 int length  0 ArrayListltEmployeegt empArray  new ArrayListltEmployeegt  public static void mainString[] args       TODO Autogenerated method stub     EmployeeGUI empG  new EmployeeGUI     empG.frame.setVisibletrue   public EmployeeGUI      initialize   public void initialize       TODO Autogenerated method stub     frame  new JFrameA Sample Window     frame.setBounds50,50,680,400     frame.setDefaultCloseOperationJFrame.EXITONCLOSE     frame.getContentPane.setLayoutnull      label1  new JLabelFName     label1.setBounds30,33,54,25     frame.getContentPane.addlabel1      box1  new JTextField     box1.setBounds94, 35, 128,20     frame.getContentPane.addbox1      label2  new JLabelSName     label2.setBounds250,33,54,25     frame.getContentPane.addlabel2      box2  new JTextField     box2.setBounds305, 35, 128,20     frame.getContentPane.addbox2      label3  new JLabelPhone     label3.setBounds461,33,54,25     frame.getContentPane.addlabel3      box3  new JTextField     box3.setBounds500, 35, 128,20     frame.getContentPane.addbox3      button1  new JButtonAdd Employee     button1.addActionListenerthis     button1.setBounds71,131,113,39     frame.getContentPane.addbutton1      button2  new JButtonRemove Employee     button2.addActionListenerthis     button2.setBounds194,131,128,39     frame.getContentPane.addbutton2      button3  new JButtonDisplay Employee     button3.addActionListenerthis     button3.setBounds332,131,128,39     frame.getContentPane.addbutton3      button4  new JButtonQuit Program     button4.addActionListenerthis     button4.setBounds475,131,113,39     frame.getContentPane.addbutton4      table1  new JTable     table1.setBounds0,184,664,178     frame.getContentPane.addtable1   Override public void actionPerformedActionEvent e       TODO Autogenerated method stub     String action  JButton e.getSource.getActionCommand     ifaction.equalsAdd Employee              String fName  box1.getText         String lName  box2.getText         String pNo  box3.getText          int mobile  Integer.parseIntpNo          Employee ee  new EmployeefName,lName,mobile         empArray.addee         length         JOptionPane.showMessageDialognull, Employee Added          ifaction.equalsRemove Employee              String fName  box1.getText, lName  box2.getText          int mobile  Integer.parseIntbox3.getText         Employee ee  new EmployeefName,lName,mobile         iflengthgt0                      forint i0 iltempArray.size i                              ifempArray.geti.getLName  ee.getLName                                      empArray.removei                     JOptionPane.showMessageDialognull, Employee Removed                                                else                    throw new ListEmptyExceptionList is Empty                   ifaction.equalsDisplay Employee              forint i  0 i ltempArray.size i                      table1.setModelnew DefaultTableModel                     new Object[][]                              empArray.geti.getFName,empArray.geti.getLName,empArray.geti.getMobile                     ,                     new String[]                          First Name, Surname, Phone Number                                                         ifaction.equalsQuit Program              System.exit0        codepre  pand the Employee Classp  precodepublic class Employee  private String fName,lName private int mobile  public EmployeeString fName, String lName, int mobile      setFNamefName     setLNamelName     setMobilemobile   private void setMobileint mobile       TODO Autogenerated method stub     this.mobile  mobile   public void setLNameString lName       TODO Autogenerated method stub     this.lName  lName   public void setFNameString fName       TODO Autogenerated method stub     this.fName  fName   public String getFName      return fName   public String getLName      return lName   public int getMobile      return mobile   public String toString      return getFName getLName getMobile   public void print      System.out.printlntoString   codepre

Negative 12282 pIm working with the Kinect 2.0 and in particular with the color stream.  The color stream arrives with a whooping 19201080 resolution, which is great Except, I intend to capture the image bytes and write them to disk.  So, the most viable solution for me is to compress each image frame and then store the compressed image rather than the raw high resolution image.p  pI have a solution but I feel its a bit of a round the houses way of doing this.  p  pBasically, I get the raw pixels, write them to a WriteableBitmap and then compress the ImageSource using the following two methodsp  p1 Write to WriteableBitmapp  precodethis.colorBitmap.WritePixels                 new Int32Rect0, 0, this.colorBitmap.PixelWidth, this.colorBitmap.PixelHeight,                 this.colorPixels,                 this.colorBitmap.PixelWidth  intthis.bytesPerPixel,                 0 codepre  p2 Compress this to jpegp  precode        public static byte[] CompressToBytesImageSource src, int compressionrate                                        var enc  new JpegBitmapEncoder             enc.QualityLevel  compressionrate              var bf  BitmapFrame.CreateBitmapSourcesrc             enc.Frames.Addbf              using var ms  new MemoryStream                              enc.Savems                 return ms.ToArray                       codepre  pWhich works fine, as I said, but I think it would be much better if I could get the raw pixels from the Kinect and then directly compress byte array rather than writing to a WriteableBitmap and then compressing that.  Just seems like an extra step.p  pBTW, this is the code I use to grab the bytes from the color framep  precode    using ColorFrame colorFrame  e.FrameReference.AcquireFrame              if colorFrame  null                      FrameDescription colorFrameDescription  colorFrame.FrameDescription              if colorFrameDescription.Width  this.colorBitmap.PixelWidth ampamp colorFrameDescription.Height  this.colorBitmap.PixelHeight                              if colorFrame.RawColorImageFormat  ColorImageFormat.Bgra                                      colorFrame.CopyRawFrameDataToArraythis.colorPixels                                  else                                      colorFrame.CopyConvertedFrameDataToArraythis.colorPixels, ColorImageFormat.Bgra                                             codepre  pBaring in mind that when working with the color stream at all the number of frames per second you are able to capture drops, from say 3032 to 2629 roughly, I want to use the most efficient way.p  pOne thing Ive noticed that when searching for compression solutions in c, is that a good percentage of articles are aimed at storing a single image to disk.  Whereas I need this compression to be carried out in memory, as I am writing multiple images to disk using a binary writer.p

I think the problem is the outer datagrid which loads one row completely and inside this row there is the datagrid with a lot of rows and the RowVirtualization doesnt work.p  pDoes anyone have an idea how to fix the problemp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.com8hcBv.png altenter image description herep  precodeltDataGrid xNameTestsGroupsDataGrid Grid.Row0 DataContextBinding TestsGroupsViewModel              AutoGenerateColumnsFalse              HeadersVisibilityNone              ItemsSourceBinding TestsGroups              SelectionModeExtended              SelectionUnitCellOrRowHeader              GridLinesVisibilityNone BorderThickness0,0,0,0              ScrollViewer.CanContentScrollTrue              EnableRowVirtualizationTrue              EnableColumnVirtualizationTrue             VirtualizingPanel.VirtualizationModeStandard             VirtualizingPanel.ScrollUnitPixel             VirtualizingPanel.IsVirtualizingTrue             VirtualizingPanel.CacheLengthUnitPixel             gt     ltDataGrid.Columnsgt         ltDataGridTemplateColumn HeaderDataGridsInside IsReadOnlyTrue Widthgt             ltDataGridTemplateColumn.CellTemplategt                 ltDataTemplategt                     ltdataGridInDataGridTestsGroupControl xNameTestsGroup                                                              AutoGenerateColumnsFalse                                                              ItemsSourceBinding Tests                                                              SelectionModeExtended                                                              SelectionUnitCellOrRowHeader                                                             GridLinesVisibilityHorizontal                                                              ScrollViewer.CanContentScrollTrue                                                              EnableRowVirtualizationTrue                                                              EnableColumnVirtualizationTrue                                                             VirtualizingPanel.VirtualizationModeStandard                                                             VirtualizingPanel.ScrollUnitPixel                                                             VirtualizingPanel.IsVirtualizingTrue                                                             VirtualizingPanel.CacheLengthUnitPixel                                                             gt                 ltDataTemplategt             ltDataGridTemplateColumn.CellTemplategt         ltDataGridTemplateColumngt     ltDataGrid.Columnsgt ltDataGridgt codepre

Negative 12282 pI have a base size in my html of 62.5 and I multiply my headers fontsizes accordingly. When I inspect it in my Chrome different h2 headings have the same fontsize, but they appear in diff. sizes on my screen. From my understanding the font sizes with  depend on the fontsize of html. But anyways the parent containers are also the same width.p  precode html      fontsize 62.5     h1, h2, h3, h4      textalign center     h1      fontsize 250     h2      fontsize 187.5     h3      fontsize 125     h4      fontsize 100     fontweight bold     marginbottom 0.5em  codepre  pI figured out, that there are two fontsizes in the parent elements, which are crossed out. If I deactivate them in my developer window it still affects the size of the headers. Interesting to see.p  pBut I think I had a misunderstanding, I thought if I have a parent defined in the css like codediv h1code, the fontsize of the parent affects the size. But it seems that every parent fontsize has an effect on its child elements. That makes working with , like in the article below, in my humble opinion useless, because you are not able to set a hierarchy for the fonts. Or am I wrong So the best way would be to use rems everywhere to get consistent fontsizesp

Negative 12282 pIve been recently assigned on a project using Teradata. Ive been told to strictly use DROPCREATE instead of DELETE ALL, because the latter leaves some space allocated someway. This is counterintuitive to me, and I think its probably wrong. I searched the web for a comparison between the two methods, but I found nothing. This only reinforces my belief that DELETE ALL doesnt suffer from the issue above. However, if this is the case, I must prove it both practically and theoretically.p  pSo, my question is is there a difference in space allocation between the two methods If not, is there an official document user guide, technical specification, whatever else that proves itp  pThank youp

Negative 12282 pIve an application in C which involves a lot of file operations, i.e., reading, moving, deleting, appending, etc. For Example, a file is read from a source path on local FS and after processing, it is deleted from there and the processed file is written to target location on local FS. This is all done parallelly on a group of systems with each working only on the local files. Files were distributed among them by the load balancerp  pHow can I possibly improve the performance of this applicationp  pThings that I can think of arep  p1. Create a queue for a particular type of operation such as delete. Put the required info in the queue and a separate thread will be processing the queue.p  p2. Instead of working on FS, use a inmemory Data store such as Redis. As the data will be in cache, operations will be faster.p  p3. Increasing the parallelism of the code. Each thread will be working on separate file and should be faster.p  pWill the above approaches work Please suggest any other alternatives that might be worth giving a thought.p

Negative 12282 pImagine having some sort of incoming data either by callback or an codeInputStreamcode that you need to strongcontinuouslystrong convert into a Java 8 codeStreamcode. We dont know when the incoming datastream stops, but we know that it emcanem stop.p  pSo far Ive seen two ways of getting around this problem and Im interested in the best practices on how to achieve this. Mainly because I this must be something someone has faced before. There must be a simpler way of doing it than the ideas below.p  p1 The most simple way is to treat the source as a codeSuppliercode and just use codeStream.generatecode to serve datap  precodeStream.generate gt blockCallToGetData codepre  pHowever, this has the disadvantage, that the stream never ends. So whenever an input source stops sending, the stream just keeps calling the method. Unless we throw a Runtime exception naturally, but this can get ugly fast.p  p2 The second idea is to use a codeIteratorcode converted to a codeSpliteratorcode where the codenextcode method blocks until we find the next element. As a crude examplep  precodeclass BlockingIterator implements IteratorltDatagt     Override void boolean hasNext      return true       Override Data next      return blockCallToGetData      codepre  pThe advantage of this is that I can stop the stream by returning codefalsecode in the codehasNextcode method. However, in situations where we do not control the speed of the incoming data such as in a callback, we would need to keep a buffer of ready elements for the iterator. This buffer could grow infinitely big, before someone calls codenextcode on the iterator.p  pSo, my question goes what is the best practice for serving blocking input into a streamp

Negative 12282 psorry in advance for not having any code written yet to share but I have been searching around for quite some time yet and havent been able to find a good source or solution. I am trying to figure out if it is possible for me to incorporate a google maps api that will calculate an estimated travel time between two locations that I can return to the user in a Windows Form. p  pThe starting location and destination location will be entered into two separate textboxs the outcome of this is, either when a button is clicked, or once the form that the information is entered into is saved, an estimated travel time will be calculated and shown in a grid or textbox. I have seen a few articles that show how to calculate the distance and I have thought about trying to calculate a really rough estimated time by calculating the distance and dividing it by a constant for the speed but I would really like to know if I can use googles application of this instead.p
Negative 12282 pTrying to migrate our web application from GlassFish2 GF to Tomcat7 TC.p  pIn GF we used AuthContext approach like in a hrefhttpdocs.forgerock.orgenopenam11.0.0devguidechapauthentication relnofollowthis examplea to login users using PolicyAgent3 PA, after which we received UserPrincipal with roles in next Requests.p  pIn TC the same approach didnt work yet. I can login the user, but I dont get UserPrincipal in next Requests. I managed to make PAs sampleapp work, but it uses Form Authentication through OpenAM, which doesnt suit us.p  pIs it possible to use AuthContext approach in TC at all Because comparing agent.jar implementations in GF and TC, I came to the conclusion that it might not be supported. In GFs PA there is implementation of IJ2EEAuthenticationHandler com.sun.identity.agents.appserver.v81.AmASJ2EEAuthHandler that authenticates user and sets UserPrincipal in the process, but in TCs PA there is only default implementation of handler com.sun.identity.agents.filter.J2EEAuthenticationHandler, which doesnt set UserPrincipal, its authenticate method just returns true.p  pIs AuthContext approach supported in Tomcat or not How else is it possible to programmatically authenticate users to OpenAM and get UserPrincipalsp

Negative 12282 pDuring a site build, I came across this direction for mouseover styles in the design paraphrased by mep  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comuD7Tm.jpg altparaphrased comp stylep  pThis is simple enough to do with js or even css image swapping... but it made me ponder. There are going to be a few dozen such icon links across the site  each paired with text, and each potentially needing additional colors, or to have the blue color adjusted. It would be a headache to create a new version of each image for any additional colors, and it would be a nightmare if any colors needed to be adjusted. Wouldnt it be nice if you could control the text and image colors in one place with cssp  pIve done some research, and popular opinion on affecting the color in an image seems to be split between working with CSS3 masks or putting the whole works in SVG. CSS Masks are a very attractive option for their simplicity, but have a hrefhttpcaniuse.comfeatcssmasks relnofollowone glaring support gapa  whereas a hrefhttpwww.w3.orgTRSVG11masking.html relnofollowSVG is recommended by W3Ca but seems to rely on the images being in .svg format the .png solutions get complicated and spotty support.p  pSo, is anyone aware of a solution that would enable me to effectively change the color of a flat .png image, that provides adequate browser support Bonus points for simplicityelegance, but Ill accept anything that only requires a path to a .png image and a hex color. Thanksp  hr  pstrongEdit 1strong For the record, IE910 are out of scope here  were only looking at 8 and 11. Thanksp  hr  pstrongEdit 2strong Other failed considerationsp  pIve considered simply creating an inverted stencil of each icon and overlaying it on a background color. This, however, poses a problem for our users and content editors, since these icons will be used elsewhere and a white stencil on a white background is useless.p  pAlso read the answers a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions7415872changecolorofpngimageviacsson this related questiona, but filters dont seem to accept a hex value nor are they fully supported. The icon font might work, but would not be easily extensiblemodifiable to a nonsavvy user  the uploadtocms functionality is very desired here.p

Negative 12282 pI have a table in MSAccess that contains the paths of directories. In the form, I have a listbox that contains the list of files to be searched.

For example, in the table if I have 5 different paths of directories and in the listbox if I have 2 files to search, the loop runs always 10 times even if I find the 2 files in the first two iterations. As per the code, even if the file has already been found in the first directory path, it searches for the same file in the remaining 4 directories. Is there a better way to do it reducing the rumber of iterations p  pIn my case, I will normally have atleast 10 directory paths and 20 files in the listbox to search, so the loop will iterate for 200 times always which will bring down the performance.     p

Therefor, I assumed that it would be appropriate to typecast the memory address to a pointer of type codeTcode so that the individual block of memory would be completely deallocated. This would be done for the entire linked list, ensuring that all allocated memory is freed.

I have tried this approach many different times in many different ways, including typecasting to codevoidcode instead of codeTcode.p  pThis problem has had me stumped for days, and any help would be appreciated.

Negative 12282 pI have a fact table that has 4 date columns CreatedDate, LoginDate, ActiveDate and EngagedDate. I have a dimension table called DimDate whose primary key can be used as foreign key for all the 4 date columns in fact table. So the model looks like this. img srchttpi.stack.imgur.com8HFmt.png altenter image description herep  pBut the problem is, when I want to do subfiltering for the measures based on the date column. For ex  Count  all users who were created in the last month and are engaged in this month. This is not possible to do with this design, coz when I filter the measure with create date , I cant further filter for a different time window for engaged date. Since all the connected to same dimension, they are not working independently.p  pHowever, If I create a separate date dimension table for each of the columns, and join them like this then it works.  img srchttpi.stack.imgur.comB0aJQ.png altenter image description here But this looks very cumbersome when I have 20 different date columns in fact table in real world scenario, where I have to create 20 different dimensions and connect them one by one.

Negative 12282 pI have a uitable and a function that returns the id of the item once the user clicks on its respective row. The id is also a global variable, as it is used over various functions.  The idea is that I create an array with all the user chosen items from the uitable, terminated when save playlist is clicked. Ex. if the user chooses items with ids 5, 7, 9 in succession and then clicks the save playlist button, I want the array to hold p  precode5 7 9 codepre  pI thought that the best way to do this is using a while loop. The while loop should check if the save button has been clicked. I have a global variable that changes once the program goes into the save playlist button callback function.p  pThe problem is that once the user chooses an ID, the array keeps on iterating until the user chooses another ID, and will keep on iterating etc etc until the save button is clicked. Ex the user clicks on ID 5, the array will record 55555555555555... recurring until user clicks on ex. ID 7 555555555555557777777777, since the program keeps on looping and looping without pausing. p  pThe code looks like thisp  precode while keeprunning      idvec  [idvec id]  end codepre  pkeeprunning is a global variable and is initialized with a value of 1 in the opening function. It is changed to 0 in the save playlist callback function.p  pI thought to fix this problem by introducing a new global variable call it itemselected that initializes in the opening function as 1 and changes to 1 again everytime the cell selection callback is called. After an ID is added to the array in the while loop, this variable resets to 0. p  pThe idea is that the loop should iterate while the save playlist button is not clicked controlled by the keeprunning global variable BUT the program should not let the while loop iterate until the user clicks on another row i.e. until the cell selection call back function is called again.p  pI need something like this but this doesnt work infinite loop. Or else some other suggestionp  precode while keeprunning  trackselected     idvec  [idvec id]     trackselected  0  end codepre  pThank you in advancep

Negative 12282 pI was looking at the Java source code for the codeAtomicIntegercode class found a hrefhttpgrepcode.comfilerepository.grepcode.comjavarootjdkopenjdk6b14javautilconcurrentatomicAtomicInteger.javaherea to see which atomic primitives are required to implement a JVM. I noticed they use the undocumented codeUnsafecode API to implement their atomic integer operations and that the only two primitives they use seem to be the codecompare and swapcode and codecompare and setcode operations. And the Unsafe class implements these instructions as native methods which leads me to believe they are using the native instructions which perform these primitive operations in the general case. However, not every processorthough most modern ones do has an instruction set which supports these primitives natively. Now even without native processor support those primitives could be implemented by the VM in a way that guarantees atomicity with other VM threads, but not necessarily with other native threads. So does java require these primitives on the native architecture to have a valid JVM and thus all JVM implementations would support atomicity with native threads, or is the atomicity in java only guaranteed between java threadsp

Negative 12282 pWe have an existing log macro in our code. Lets call it LOGXXX where XXX is the log level to use, such as LOGINFO, LOGDEBUG, LOGERROR etc. We stream log messages to the macrop  precodeLOGINFO ltlt This is a log message. codepre  pUnder the covers, the macro creates a temporary object that exposes a stream. When the object is destroyed the logger is called with the stream contents.p  pAs our codebase grows, we want to add structured logging with key value pairs. We would also like to add a mandatory module name to the macro, forcing callers to specify what logical module in the software is doing the logging.p  precodeLOGINFOsome module ltlt makepairRequestId, foo ltlt makepairMsg, This is a log message. codepre  pI can implement this by creating a different object whose constructor takes the module name, and overloads the ltlt operator to take string pairs.p  pNow I can name this new macro LOGINFO2 and be done with it. But that name feels ugly to me. What this really is conceptually is an overload, but macros cant be overloaded.p  pOne route is to implement a selector that picks the right macro based on the number of arguments. But since the original call sites have no parantheses LOGINFO, I dont think this will work.

Negative 12282 pstrongThe context isstrong MVC5JavascriptSPA application.p  pstrongThe case isstrong  The user clicks here and there and generates requests. But in the mean time he decides to go to another area of the app and initiates some more clicks with requests, discarding the first batch of requests. p  pstrongThe problem isstrong  There are two batches of requests generated by the user for both of the app areas the user visited. The first batch of requests are in vain because even the server brings back the result the frontend no longer cares.p  pstrongThe desired resultstrong is an application structure that can pipeline the requests by app area and if the user switches to another area then the app can send cancellation token to the back end so it wastes no more time executing the requests which result will no longer be needed by the user.p  pIs there a well known pattern for this problem or a Javascript SPA framework built with that feature in mindp
Negative 12282 pIm currently experimenting with flexbox layouts and have a problem, that codeoverflowcode wont get applied, when I nest multiple flexboxes.p  pAs long as I just use one level of flex boxes see example 1, everything works fine As soon as its content exceed the given space, scrollbars are applied to the red box codetopcode.p  pIf I, however, introduce another layer of flexboxes see example two, there is no scrollbar on the blue box coderightcode. Instead the scrollbars appear on the body element completely ignoring the codeoverflow autocode setting on the blue box.p  pSo my question is strongHow can I get codeoverflowcode to work when using nested flexboxesstrongp  pRemark I tested this with Chrome45, Firefox 40 and IE11.

Negative 12282 pI have a function that is being used to update some information displayed on a GUI. The information should only be displayed for a short length of time about 10 seconds.p  pThe function being used to set what is displayed on the GUI is called repeatedly, and what is displayed is dependent on conditions within that function. p  pThe issue that Im having at the moment, is that there is some information being displayed that needs to change depending on how long it has been displayed for.p  pI tried creating a variable that was set to the system time at the beginning of the function, and then later in the function, had a condition that would change the value of the variable if the current system time was greater than the original system time  10 seconds.p  pHowever, the problem with that was that since the function is being called repeatedly, the original system time is updated with every call iteration.p  pI found the following quesion on SO a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions17701197howtoruncodeinsidealooponlyoncewithoutexternalflagHow to run code inside a loop only once without external flaga and tried to implement what was suggested in the answer by Angew, so that the variable holding the original system time would only be set once within the loop. My code currently looks like thisp  precodestruct rnOnce     template lttypename Tgt     runOnceT ampampf f   ...  void updateHeader     ...     static runOnce a[]         timeWarningStarted  SimulationTimeInstancegtgetSimulationTime      ... codepre  pBut when I run my program, and attach to process in debug, the call to codestatic runOnce a[]... code appears to be skipped none of the breakpoints Ive put on these lines are ever hit, even though the breakpoints on the lines just before and just after are.p  pCan anyone explain to me why this is What am I doing wrong herep  pstrongEDITstrongp  pThe desired behviour is that the codetimeWarningStartedcode variable is only given a value once, despite the fact that it is being set inside a function that is called several times. It is a global variable and the function that is setting its value will be continuously called as that is the one thats used to update what is displayed on the GUI.p  pEffectively, I want codetimeWarnigStartedcode to be set to the current system time the first time that this code is executed, and then to retain its value for the duration of time that the program is running.p  pBefore changing my code to what it is above, I had something similar top  precodevoid updateHeader     ...     timeWaringtarted  SimulationTimeInstancegtgetSimulationTime     ...  codepre  pBut this was in issue because codetimeWarningStartedcode was being given the current system time every time this function was run i.e. it was continuously being updated. So, later in the same function, when I wanted to check whether the warning had been displayed for 10 seconds, and if so, to stop it from being displayed, I was doing something likep  precodevoid updateHeader     ...     timeWarningStarted  SimulationTimeInstancegtgetSimulationTime     ...     currentSimulationTime  SimulationTimeInstancegtgetSimulationTime     ifcurrentSimulationTime lt timeWarningStarted  10         warningMessage            ...  codepre  pBut obviously, since both codetimeWarningStartedcode amp codecurrentSimulationTimecode will be given a new value every time the above code is run, they will have too close a value because they will be set at almost exactly the same time.p  pSo, by setting codetimeWarningStartedcode inside coderunOncecode, I was hoping that codetimeWarningStartedcode would only be given a value the first time that this code was run, and would retain that value for the duration of the simulation, but it appears that this section of code is now never run...p  precodestatic runOnce a[]     timeReplyFailWarningStarted  SESLSimulationTimeInstancegtgetSimulationTime   0  codepre

Firstly, according to guide I add and compile 1 bit adder  it works correctly.p  precode Simulation Tutorial  1bit Adder   This is just to make a reference to some common things needed. LIBRARY IEEE use IEEE.STDLOGIC1164.ALL   We declare the 1bit adder with the inputs and outputs  shown inside the port.

After that I add other VHDL to test that. This is testbench of 1 bit adderp  precode ENGR 10 VHDL Lab  1bit Adder Testbench   A testbench is used to rigorously tests a design that you have made.  The output of the testbench should allow the designer to see if  the design worked.  The testbench should also report where the testbench  failed.   This is just to make a reference to some common things needed. LIBRARY IEEE use IEEE.STDLOGIC1164.ALL   Decare a testbench.  Notice that the testbench does not have any  input or output ports. entity TESTADD is end TESTADD   Describes the functionality of the tesbench. architecture TEST of TESTADD is        The object that we wish to test is declared as a component of       the test bench. Its functionality has already been described elsewhere.      This simply describes what the objects inputs and outputs are, it      does not actually create the object.     component BITADDER          port a, b, cin          in  STDLOGIC             sum, cout          out STDLOGIC      end component       Specifies which description of the adder you will use.     for U1 BITADDER use entity WORK.BITADDERBHV       Create a set of signals which will be associated with both the inputs      and outputs of the component that we wish to test.     signal As, Bs  STDLOGIC     signal CINs     STDLOGIC     signal SUMs     STDLOGIC     signal COUTs    STDLOGIC       This is where the testbench for the BITADDER actually begins.        begin       Create a 1bit adder in the testbench.         The signals specified above are mapped to their appropriate      roles in the 1bit adder which we have created.     U1 BITADDER port map As, Bs, CINs, SUMs, COUTs       The process is where the actual testing is done.     process     begin           We are now going to set the inputs of the adder and test          the outputs to verify the functionality of our 1bit adder.

Negative 12282 pYoutube uses a lossy compression for the audio quality of uploaded videos. Since videos on Youtube can now be played back at up to 2x their normal speed, could someone theoretically achieve higher sound quality at that playback This is my hypothesis.p  ol liStart with a lossless or otherwise very high quality sound file.li liSlow it down to 50 using audio editing software, and save it again as lossless or high quality.li liUse that sloweddown audio to make a video for uploading, and again save it so that the audio quality is not diminished.li liUpload that to youtube, and have its quality inevitably degraded, BUT THENli liPlay back the video on youtube at 2x the speed, to possibly regain some fidelityli ol  pThis is probably a question about a technicality in the audio specification used by Youtube, or even just audio compression in general. So what do you thinkp

Negative 12282 pI was just wondering whether its possible to communicate data between Two QThreads. I already know how to enter data before a QThread Starts and then invoke the run method. But I have a situation where I use a QThread A to acquire serial data from a Servo Motor controller and display it using a Main GUI. I also run another Qthread B which does several long processes roughly about 1000 lines of code executing inside Qtheard B. Half way through the execution of QThread B, I want to use the serial data in QThread A and log it inside QThread B. Essential try to pipe the serial data from QThread A into QThread B when QThread B is ready to log.p  pWhat is the best way of doing this Ive tried using a global variable, but has had no success. What other options are availablep  pPlease can someone give me some advice, thanks in advancep  pSanka  p

However, it seems codengchangecode only gets fired when the user actually types in the box, not when the model changes.p  pAdditionally, I dont know how to actually find the input when the action gets called. I tried to pass codethiscode, but that seems to only pass the scope. There are multiple of these inputs on the page, and I only want to select the relevant one, so I cant just use codedocument.querySelectorcode or something like it.p  pHow should I do thisp
Negative 12282 pI have a div with a background image.p  pInside this div, I have another div, that has an animation on its scale and opacity, and it makes kind of a ripple effect around the parent image.p  precodeltdiv classimagegt    ltdiv classripplegtltdivgt ltdivgt codepre  pThe image has a fixed positioning, because it supposed to be at the top of the screen. The ripple div has an absolute positioning can be also relative, and the animation should start from the center of the image.p  pThe problem is that the nested div animation appears above the parent div. I want the image to be at the top, and the animation behind it.p  pIve tried different solutions, including zindexes, and negative zindex, but it looks the same.p  pDemo for the problem a hrefhttpjsfiddle.netm271h3s61 relnofollowhttpjsfiddle.netm271h3s61a.p  pYou can see in the demo that the black circle appears above googles logo.

Negative 12282 pI have a problem with an application that I try to publish on the platform the Play Store. When I uploaded the .apk file I have seen that it is only compatible with 1 device. I have reviewed the file AndroidManifest.xml and I have not found anything that restricts the use in other device. The application takes the same permissions as any other similar application that I have published, and this other is compatible with more than 8000 devices. The only thing that is different is that in this new app Ive added the service GCM with their required permissions, and the bitcoinj0.12.3 library.

Negative 12282 pI am using the JIRA nodemodule in my project. I am currently using it to search through JIRA for issues by manually entering a query string i.e. codefilter  Critical Highcode as a parameter into a function codejira.searchJira...code which is run in the JQL field.p  pWhat I want to do is to run a JQL statement through Node to retrieve a list of saved filters by anyone. I know there is a section in JIRA to search for saved filters but cannot find a way to access that through Node.p
Negative 12282 pCan someone please help me clarify.p  pI am currently using collaborative filtering ALS which returns a recommendation list with scores corresponding to the recommended items. In addition to this, I am boosting the scores 0.1 if the items contain a tag that corresponds with what the user has specified they prefer such as romantic movies. To me, this is considered a hybrid collaborative approach since its boosting the Collaborative filtering results with contentbased filtering Please correct me if I am wrong. p  pNow, what if I did the same approach without doing Collaborative filtering would it be considered Contentbased Filtering since I will be still recommending dishes based on the content and attributes of each dish corresponding to what the user has specified they like such as romantic movies. p  pThe reason why Im confused is because Ive seen contentbased filtering where they apply an algorithm such as Naive Bayes etc, and this approach would be similar to a simple search of the items on the contents. p
