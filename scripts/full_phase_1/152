Positive 152 pHow do you use sort in rerank query From what I have tried it always sorts on main query.

Positive 152 pIm pretty new to Lucene, so forgive me in advance if some of my terminology is wrong.p  pLucene offers different types of fields keyword, text, unstored, unindexed, but it seems it also supports emNumericem field, emIntem field and emFloatem field.p  pNow, Im wondering if emthe closer the betterem functionality existsor is easy to implement in Lucenep  pI want the strongcreationdatestrong of a document strongstored as the unix time into a float fieldstrong. Then I want to be able to compare the unix time given in a query with the indexed unix time of the documents.p  pInstead of a range query which checks if the range is between particular bounds or a boolean query which checks if the values are the same strongI want to be able to return a sense of similarity based on the time between the unix times.strong If the timespan is small it should end up with a higher score than if the timespan is large. Preferably this shouldnt happen linear but instead exponentially for example. So as the title of this question says emThe closer, the betterem.p  pIve noticed that strongElasticSearchstrong, which uses Lucene as core offers a hrefhttpswww.elastic.coguideenelasticsearchguidecurrentdecayfunctions.html relnofollowdecay function scoresa, is this the behaviour that Im looking for and is this present in Lucenep  pLastly, Im wondering can one compare this type of scoring together with the default tfidf scoring that is used to query the body of the documents, in a way that the final score is a combination of the score of the timespan between the documents and the textual similarity of the bodies.p
Positive 152 pCan Lucene counts documents after having grouped them by a NumericFieldp  pOnly counting, not loading all documents content.p
Positive 152 pI am trying to modify scores from normal query with different functions defined in functionscore. p  pTo find out what scores calculated by my functions are, I specify boostmode to replace.

Positive 152 pWe are using Lucid works Solr version 4.6.p  pOur source system basically stores data into two destination systems one through real time and another thorough the batch mode. Data is ingested into Solr through the real time route.p  pWe need to periodically synch the data ingested in Solr with the data ingested into the batch system.p  pThe design we are currently trying to evaluate is to import the data from batch system into another Solr collection, but really not sure how to sync both collections i.e the one with realtime data and second is through batch import. p  pI read through data import handlers but this will override the existing data in Solr. Is there any way in which we can identify the delta between the two collections and ingest that only.p

Positive 152 pI have an existing Lucene store with many millions of documents, each one representing metadata for an entity. I have a few Id fields Id1, Id2 .. Id5 and each document can have zero or many values for this field. The index is only ever queried by one of these Ids at a time. Ive indexed these fields independently and its is all working great. I initially chose to use Lucene as it was by far the fastest way to query such a vast number of small documents and I am happy with my decision.p  pHowever now I must store another type of document which also represent a different kind of metadata for entities and have values for Id1, Id2 .. Id5, and which also will be queried by one of those Ids separately. The existing metadata and this new set of data will be stored and queried for independently from each other.p  pHow do I query Lucene by an Id but for only one type of document. I can think of a few options, but Id like to know what those in the know recommend from experience in order to keep Lucene manageable and fast.p  ol liUse separate Lucene indexes. This would avoid the problem since the document types are orthogonal. Theres also the benefit being able to read and write from the indexes separately.li liRename the fields Id1..Idn for the new documents to XId1...XIdn. In this way, documents of one type would not have the same field names as documents of another type. This seems like more of a workaround to avoid the problem than an actual solution.li liAdd a numeric field Type and change indexies to Type, Idx. This method seems wasteful as each index would have to also contain the type.li ol  pI am able to break backwards compatibility with my existing setup. It would be great if the solution can be reused if I come to add another document type.p

Positive 152 pI guess the only way to search for partial words and phrases in Lucene is by using ngramtokenizer. If there are any other ways then please suggest.

I could use the .ToMethod or ToFactoryMethod binding to explicitly new it up, but I would like all its dependencies resolved by Ninject beforehand.p  pIt wouldu be nice to do something likep  precodeBindltSomeClassgt     .ToSelf     .Aftersc gt sc.MethodIWantToCall  then after here, Ninject returns the object. codepre  pIs there some way to do this in Ninject 1.01.1p

Negative 152 pIs there an easy way to get the version of the MySQL driver programmatically from within a C program referencing MySQL.Data.dll p
Negative 152 pI have a PHP codebase that was written to address our MySQL tables in mixed case.  For example, codexarintakeformgeneratorChangeLogcode.p  pOur code also runs on windows, and before we knew any better, we imported several databases on to a Windows server.  This resulted in Windows MySQL changing all the table names to lower case. codexarintakeformgeneratorchangelogcode.  We now know how to prevent that from happening to new databases. codeSet lowercasetablenamescode And, the code runs fine on the Windows servers because MySQL just doesnt care about the case of the tables on Windows.p  pHeres the problem.  The Windows server is giving us grief and we need to move all of the databases off to a Linux server.  Because all of the table names have converted to lower case, the code will NOT work on Linux.  Luckily, Xaraya creates table mappings.  So, in theory, I could set up a new code base for these databases and change the mappings of every module to use the lower case tables.  Or, we could manually change the table names after we import them onto the Linux machine to get the table case correct.  p  pchanging codelowercasetablenamescode does not correct the databases that were mangled before the flag was set.  These all have the lower case table names.p  pIm not wild about either option.  Does anybody know an ingenious way to handle thisp
Negative 152 pI recently found and fixed a bug in a site I was working on that resulted in millions of duplicate rows of data in a table that will be quite large even without them still in the millions. I can easily find these duplicate rows and can run a single delete query to kill them all. The problem is that trying to delete this many rows in one shot locks up the table for a long time, which I would like to avoid if possible. The only ways I can see to get rid of these rows, without taking down the site by locking up the table arep  ol liWrite a script that will execute thousands of smaller delete queries in a loop. This will theoretically get around the locked table issue because other queries will be able to make it into the queue and run in between the deletes. But it will still spike the load on the database quite a bit and will take a long time to run.li liRename the table and recreate the existing table itll now be empty. Then do my cleanup on the renamed table. Rename the new table, name the old one back and merge the new rows into the renamed table. This is way takes considerably more steps, but should get the job done with minimal interruption. The only tricky part here is that the table in question is a reporting table, so once its renamed out of the way and the empty one put in its place all historic reports go away until I put it back in place. Plus the merging process could be a bit of a pain because of the type of data being stored. Overall this is my likely choice right now.li ol  pI was just wondering if anyone else has had this problem before and, if so, how you dealt with it without taking down the site and, hopefully, with minimal if any interruption to the users If I go with number 2, or a different, similar, approach, I can schedule the stuff to run late at night and do the merge early the next morning and just let the users know ahead of time, so thats not a huge deal. Im just looking to see if anyone has any ideas for a better, or easier, way to do the cleanup.p
Negative 152 ptoday I have coded a test case for my application, to see how transactions behave. And I have found that nothing works the way I thought it does.p  pI have a Springbased application using Hibernate as JPA provider, backed by MySQL. I have DAO objects, extending Springs JpaDaoSupport. These are covered by Springs transaction management.p  pThe test case Ive created works like this 1 An entity is created, with some counter set to 0. 2 Then two threads are created, which both call a DAO method incrementCounter in a loop.p  pI thought that when DAO methods are covered with transaction, then only one thread will be inside it i.e., Spring will take care of synchronization. But this has proven to be false assumption.p  pAfter temporary solving this by adding codesynchronizedcode to the DAO method, I found out that Hibernate does not store the changes made by the DAO method, and the other thread, when finding the entity, has old data. Only explicit call of codethis.getJpaTemplate.flushcode helped.p  pI also thought that entity manager would give me the same entity instance from the cache of the persistence context, but this is also false. I have checked hashCode and equals, and they are fine  based on entitys bussines key.p  pAny comments welcome, as it seems I miss some basic concepts of how JPA  Spring works with transactions.p  ol liShould DAO methods be codesynchronizedcodeli liShould I call flush at the end of every DAO methodli liIs spring responsible for making the calls to DAO methods behave transactionally i.e. not letting two threads work with the same entity at the same timeli liIf not, how do I achieve thisli ol  pNote that in my test case, I use a single DAO object, but that should be OK as Springs beans are singletons  rightp  pThanks for any help.p  precodepublic class EntityDaoImpl extends JpaDaoSupport implements EntityDao   public synchronized void incrementCounter String znacka       String threadName  Thread.currentThread.getName   log.infothreadName   entering do incrementCounter.

Negative 152 pI have been working for some years now as C Developer using MS Visual Studio as working platform. Since I privately prefer to use linux, I recently took the chance to move my working environment to linux as well. Since I have been optimizing my windows environment for several years now,  of course it turns out several things are missing or not working as expected. Thus I have some questions for which I could not come with useful answers yet.p  pLets start the following problem different questions will probably follow later. The problem is something I have already stumbled upon several times, whenever I was forced to debug platform specific bugs on non windows platforms.p  pSimply speaking strongHow can I display Unicode UCS2 encoded strings while debugging on linuxstrongp  pNow some more details I have figured so far. Our Lib uses interally a Unicode based String class, which encodes every char as a 16bit Unicode value but we do not support multiword encodings, thus we basically can only use the UCS2 encodable subset of UTF16, but this encompasses nearly all used scripts anyway. This already poses one problem, since most platforms i.e. linux  unix consider codewchartcode types to consist of 4 bytes while on windows it is only 2 bytes, thus  I cannot simply cast the internal string buffer to codewchart code, so I am not sure, if this would really help any debugger.p  pFor stronggdbstrong I have figured, that I can call functions from the debugged code, to print debug messages. Thus I inserted a special function into our lib,  that can arbitrarily transform the string data and write it to a new buffer. Currently I transcode our internal buffer to utf8, since I expect this to be the mostly likely to work.p  pBut so far this solves the problem only partially If the string is latin, then I now get a readable output whereas one cannot directly print the latin data if it is 16 bit encoded, but I also have to deal with other scripts f.e. CJK a.k.a. Hansi  Kanji, cyrillic, greek ... and with dealing I mean I have to specifically debug data using such scripts, since the used scripts directly influence the control flow.  Ofcourse in these cases I only see the ISO chars that correspond to the multiple bytes that make up a utf8 char, which makes debugging CJK data even more cryptic then correctly displayed strings would be.p  pGenerally gdb allows to set several host and target encodings, thus It should be possible, to send the correct encoded utf8 data stream to the console.p  pBut of course Id prefer to use an IDE for debugging. Currently I am trying to make friends with eclipse and CDT, but for debugging I have also tested kdgb. In both applications I could so far only obtain incorrectly decoded utf8 data. On the other hand I once debugged a java project in eclipse on a windows platform and all internal strings were displayed correctly but this application was not using our lib and the corresponding strings, thus at least in some situations eclipse can display unicode chars correctly.p  pThe most annoying point for me is, that so far I could not even come up with any proof, that displaying true unicode data i.e. non ISO chars is working in any setup on linux i.e. even the gdb scripts for QStrings I have found, seem to only display latin chars and skip the remainder, but of course  nearly every linux application seems to support unicode data, thus there  must be people around, that debug true unicode data on linux platforms and I really cannot imagine, that they are all reading hexcodes instead of directly displaying unicode strings.p  pThus any pointers to setups that allow debugging of unicode strings, based on any other string classes f.e. QString and  or IDE would also be appreciated.p
Negative 152 pI had a client ask for advice building a simple WPF LOB application the other day. They basically want a CRUD application for a database, with main purpose being as a WPF training project.p  pI also showed them Linq To SQL and they were impressed.p  pI then explained its probably not a good idea to use that L2S entities directly from their BLL or UI code. They should consider something like a Repository pattern instead.p  pAt which point I could already feel the overengineering alarm bells going off in their heads and also in mine to some extent. Do they really need all that complexity for a simple CRUD application OK, its effectively functioning as a WPF training project for them but lets pretend it turns into a real app.p  ul liDo you ever think its acceptable to use L2S entities all through your applicationli liHow difficult is it from experience to refactor to use another persistence framework laterli ul  pThe way I see it, if the UI layer uses the L2S entities as a simple a POCO without touching any L2S specific methods then that should be really easy to refactor later on if need be.p  pThey do need a way to centralize the L2S queries, so some sort of way to manage that is needed, even if they do use L2S entities directly. So in a way we are already pushing toward some aspects of DALDAORepository.p  pThe main problem with Repo I can see is the pain of mapping between L2S entities and some domain model. And is it really worth it You get quite a lot for free on L2S entities which I think would be hard to use once you map to another model.p  pThoughtsp
Negative 152 pI just started thinking about using the NHibernate second level cache in one of my apps. I would probably use the codeNHibernate.Caches.SysCache.SysCacheProvidercode which relies on ASP.net cache.p  pEnabling the cache was not a problem, but I am wondering on how to manage the cache e. g. programmatically removing certain entities from the cache etc.p  pMy application is some kind of image database. The user uploads images over a backend and can view it in the frontend by accessing codeImageDbShowuserIdsomeUserIdcodep  pThe data does not change very often. And if it changes, the users would not matter a button named clear my cache in the backend that removes the cached objects for emthis userem from the cache. p  pI found a solution online that can remove emallem cached objects from nhibernates second level cache. But thats a bit too brute force for me ... I dont want to clear the whole cache for dozens of users just because one user tried to clear the cache for his own data.p  pSo what I basically wanted to do selectively remove cached db objects from nhibernates second level cache in C.p  pIs this possible I guess it also depends on the cache provider. If this is not doable with the ASP.net cache provider, I am open for other built in  open source suggestions.p

Negative 152 pIm a having a little trouble thinking how the hell do I fix the appropriate pointers when trying to delete a node from a binary tree where that node has 2 children.p  pI understand the basic concept and Im basically just having trouble fixing the pointers...p  pSo, basically, my delete function is mostly done and every case is already working as far as my extensive testing go, everything worked OK, Im only missing the case node with 2 children. Lets say we are inside the codeelse ifcode that deals with that casep  pI will have 2 pointers there, codecurrPtrcode which holds the node to be deleted, codeprevPtrcode which holds the parent node. I also have a variable named codefromLeftcode which defines if the codecurrPtrcode parent comes from the left or right pointer on codeprevPtrcode. Then, I have a call to another function named codeextractMinTree tcode which extracts the lowest value in the tree. If I call this function with codecurrPtrgtrightcode as argument, the successor of codecurrPtrcode is going to be extracted from the tree the function will deleted it from tree, fix the pointers and return the node pointer. The successor pointer is going to be saved on codetempPtrcode.p  pHeres the structure of my tree  p  precodetypedef int TreeElement  typedef struct sTree     TreeElement item     struct sTree left    struct sTree right  Tree codepre  pAnd the code for the extract functionp  precodeTree extractMinTree tree      Tree prevPtr  NULL     Tree currPtr  tree      whilecurrPtrgtleft          prevPtr  currPtr         currPtr  currPtrgtleft           ifprevPtr prevPtrgtleft  currPtrgtright       inorder successor     return currPtr  codepre  pThe code above is missing the case here the tree only has one node, the root node, it wont work properly and it also doesnt check if the tree has any nodes at all but, it works when a tree has a few nodes.p  pSo, how do I fix the necessary pointers on the codeelse ifcode for the node deletion Also, remember that the codeleftcode and coderightcode pointers on the tree nodes will always be pointing somewhere or be codeNULLcode.p  pBy the way, I want to do this iterative.p

Negative 152 pI am about to spend a lot of time solving a problem, and I wonder if there is an existing recipe for this.  Its a browserbased application JavaScript and Dojo Toolkit that is a client of a RESTful Web Service.p  pIt uses Comet to automatically update the display.  There is a callback function that processes every message received.  [Boring details of Comet  as a sort of background operation, an HTTP request is made to the server.  This request blocks on the server until it has a message for us.  When the client finally receives the response, it calls the callback function and then makes the next HTTP request.  HTTP allows up to two simultaneous requests, so this background request does not block the foreground requests that happen when the user does things.]p  pThere is an adapter layer below the UI layer.  The UI layer thinks its getting messages pushed to it.  The adapter layer is doing the Comet requests and transforming the response from what the server sends to what the UI layer expects.  p  precodevar ourEventFilter  dojo.hitchthis, functionevt    if evt[obj]          evt.obj  this.transformevt.obj      callUIEventHandlerevt  codepre  p[dojo.hitch is syntactic sugar to make a closure, binding a functions codethiscode.]p  pThe codeobjcode may look something like thisp  precode    resources [       nameMe, typevm, linkhttpserveritemABC,       nameYou, typereal, linkhttpserveritem123],    subObjs [       resources[nameHim, typevm, linkhttpserveritemDEF     ]  codepre  pThe transform function turns it into thisp  precode    resources [       nameYou, typereal, linkhttpserveritem123,   ],    vms [       nameMe, typevm, linkhttpserveritemABC],    subObjs [       resources[],       vms [nameHim,typevm, linkhttpserveritemDEF]    ]  codepre  pWe find those resources that are of type vm and move them to a separate array.

Negative 152 pAn iPhone app which I am creating generates reports from a Core Data database as a CSV file, which can then be emailed so that the user may use that data elsewhere outside of the app. I would also like to offer the ability to generate the same reports as a PDF file of course, with nicer formatting allowing the user to immediately print the report rather than having to jump through several hoops as with the CSV file  i.e. open in another application e.g. Excel, Numbers then reformat the columns so they are wide enough for printing, bold the headings, etc.p  pEssentially, I want to provide the PDF file so that the user is immediately given a nicely formatted report, and they only need to export the CSV file if they wish to do data manipulation and need a format which is editable.p  pI was thinking that the easiest method would be taking the CSV file and the converting this into a PDF file, which would be the same as the CSV except would incorporate nicer formatting such as a tabular layout rather than the simple commaseparated format of the CSV file. I have been unable to find any readymade classes for this purpose to avoid reinventing the wheel and I am unsure how to approach this since I have limited experience with this aspect of the SDK. Any suggestions or pointers in the right direction would be much appreciated.p

Negative 152 h3Descriptionh3  pI have an Oracle stored procedure that has been running for 7 or so years both locally on development instances and on multiple client test and production instances running Oracle 8, then 9, then 10, and recently 11. It has worked consistently until the upgrade to Oracle 11g. Basically, the procedure opens a reference cursor, updates a table then completes. In 10g the cursor will contain the expected results but in 11g the cursor will be empty. No DML or DDL changed after the upgrade to 11g. This behavior is consistent on every 10g or 11g instance Ive tried 10.2.0.3, 10.2.0.4, 11.1.0.7, 11.2.0.1  all running on Windows.p  pThe specific code is much more complicated but to explain the issue in somewhat realistic overview I have some data in a header table and a bunch of child tables that will be output to PDF. The header table has a boolean NUMBER1 where 0 is false and 1 is true column indicating whether that data has been processed yet. p  pThe view is limited to only show rows in that have not been processed the view also joins on some other tables, makes some inline queries and function calls, etc. So at the time when the cursor is opened, the view shows one or more rows, then after the cursor is opened an update statement runs to flip the flag in the header table, a commit is issued, then the procedure completes.  p  pOn 10g, the cursor opens, it contains the row, then the update statement flips the flag and running the procedure a second time would yield no data. p  pOn 11g, the cursor ineveri contains the row, its as if the cursor does not open until after the update statement runs.p  piIm concerned that something may have changed in 11g hopefully a setting that can be configured that might affect other procedures and other applications. What Id like to know is whether anyone knows why the behavior is different between the two database versions and whether the issue can be resolved without code changes.ip  pbUpdate 1b I managed to track the issue down to a unique constraint. It seems that when the unique constraint is present in 11g the issue is reproducible 100 of the time regardless of whether Im running the real world code against the actual objects or the following simple example. p  pbUpdate 2b I was able to completely eliminate the view from the equation.

Negative 152 pI have a site that i have developed in asp.net. On debugging the site now hosted using iis7 i noticed a bug, i cannot reproduce this when i run it locally in vs, meaning i cant see the error. The bug occurs on the check box changed event of a devexpress check box. It connects to the database using devart.postgres sql component and linq. However, this is the same connection as anywhere else in the project. The same code works elsewhere in the project. The error i get isp  precode the requested name is valid, but no data of the requested type was found. codepre  ppart of my code is in an if statement that checks if a textbox is blank if so it does not run the code within the if statement, interestingly enough if the text box is blank the code runs, so it must be in the if statement i commented out all of the code and tried again and it still would not run. Beginning to lost objectivity with this problem, hope you can help. p

Negative 152 pI was wondering what are the general steps required in building some sort of java extension or plugin. More specifically, Im looking to build something like a C struct in java that will allow me to declare the methods from a particular class so that I can indicate the order they should be executed by the JVM. This is just pie in the sky at the moment and Im interested in how the likes of AspectJ or other java extensions work to allow you to declare syntax that is not native to java. Im assuming this would require some sort of compiler plugin. p  pAs an example, I envisage something like the followingp  precodepublic struct weakProfile     streamDataViaGprs    sendSimpleMap   public struct strongProfile     streamDataVia3G    sendComplexMap    sendAudio  codepre  pIn the above example, if I have a web service and the client has a weak profile, meaning that the device they are using to invoke the service has low processing and poor bandwidth capabilities, then I would like to only deliver only codestreamDataViaGprscode and codesendSimpleMapcode functionality. However, if the client device has strong processing capabilities and excellent bandwidth connection, then I would like to codestreamDataVia3Gcode, codesendComplexMapcode and codesendAudiocode. This is my ultimate goal, however Im not sure what would be involved in developing a structure as that above, let alone if its even possible. p

Negative 152 pLets say I have a Huuge database onto a server that works with a 1.0 version of my App.br Then I plan to change the database model and release a 2.0 version of the app.  p  pWhen I submit my 2.0 app, there will be a day the app will be available onto the appstore. I dont know that day, nor the hourminutesecond it will be available for download.  p  pSo... how may I synchronize my database model upgrade with the 2.0 app availability, assuming that I have a way to deactivate the 1.0 version calls to the server refusing the 1.0 calls and asking the user to upgrade the app p  pLets take an example. You released a chat app. But after some monthes, a court of justice oblige you to ask for the users age  But... your 1.0 app is not designed to ask this. So you update your 1.0 database model to carry an age, and release a 2.0 app that ask the users age if it is not known.p  pIn that case, maintaining the 1.0 app is not an option. Users MUST update the app, or service may be down for them.p  pSo, until the day of judgment, you can still use the 1.0 app, but after that date and as soon as the 2.0 app is available, the 2.0 app and database model must be used.p

Negative 152 pI read that on Unix systems, codemalloccode can return a nonNULL pointer even if the memory is not actually available, and trying to use the memory later on will trigger an error.

Negative 152 pI have built a small app that has a JSlider which controls the speed of an object. When the slider detects a change in its state, the objects speed changes appropriately. I was wondering if what I built utilized the Observer Pattern. Wikipedia states that an Observer Pattern is a software design pattern in which an object, called the subject, maintains a list of its dependents, called observers, and notifies them automatically of any state changes, usually by calling one of their methods. It is mainly used to implement distributed event handling systems. Within my code, whenever a change in the JSlider is detected a small piece of code is automatically executed to change the objects speed via p  precodeslider.addChangeListener             new ChangeListener                 public void stateChangedChangeEvent e                     horizSpeed  slider.getValue                     sliderTitle.setTextCurrent Speed   horizSpeed                                    codepre  pI dont think it maintains a list of dependents as Wikipedia calls for but Im not sure. If anyone could enlighten me on the subtleties of the Observer Pattern, I would greatly appreciate it. Thanksp
Negative 152 pI am debugging our webapp.   It is configured to create a DataSourceTransactionManager bean and also a HibernateTransactionManager bean on startup.   This is not intentional but is caused by a 3rd party dependency.  The effect appears to be benign.   What Im seeing via debugging is that when we persist an object via a Hibernate based DAO  the DataSourceTransactionManager is invoked and not the HibernateTransactionManager the beans both are called transactionManager.    The Spring Javadoc implies I think, rereading it now this is fine for local resources  which is our situation.  I.e. its not a distributed JTA based environment.p  pMy question is  is there any negative impact of not using the HibernateTransactionManager for ORM based persistence.    I can change the config to make the HibernateTransactionManager be used via a qualifier on the Transactional annotation on our DAOs.p  pThings are working fine in simple unit test, integration test setup but I am more concerned about scaling to full production volumes when well have thousands of users and a high level of concurrency.p  pTIA, hope this isnt too obscure.p  pSpring 3.0.x BTW.p  pThis is in the Spring 3.1 docs.  p  blockquote   pstrongSec 11.9 Solutions to Common Problems.strongp      pUse the correct PlatformTransactionManager implementation based on   your choice of transactional technologies and requirements.p blockquote

Negative 152 pI have a few thousand highres JPEG photos stored on a travel blog website, and Im hoping to write some Ruby code that will extract a few key EXIF metadata values from the images emwithoutem downloading the entire contents of each image file they are large, and I have a LOT of them.p  pIm using the exifr gem to read the EXIF data, and it is designed to work with any type of IO object, not just local files. However, the codeNetHTTPResponsecode object isnt really an IO object, although it does allow for incremental reading if you pass the codereadbodycode method a block. Ive read conflicting reports, however, about whether this increment reading really allows you to only download a portion of a file, or whether it just lets you read the contents in chunks for efficiency i.e. the entire contents is downloaded anyway.p  pSo, is what Im trying to do possible Should I be looking at alternatives to codeNetHTTPcode, or is there some way for me to get at the lowlevel TCP socket which should be an IO object to pass to the exifr code to read just enough of the image to get the EXIF data Other solutionsp

Negative 152 pIm new to XAML and C, but have been enjoying working with it in the couple of weeks Ive played with it.  Ive started working on an App and have put together a simple Settings page in XAML now Im trying to hook up events to the controls to a update application state when the user interacts with them, and b have the current state upon visiting the page.p  pIve hit two related roadblocks thoughp  ul lipthe toolkitListPicker control doesnt seem to work well when I define the ListPickerItems in XAML, so in the SettingsPage constructor, I set the contents manuallyp  precodelpColour.ItemsSource  new Listltstringgt      Red,Blue,Green,Custom  lpColour.SelectedIndex  1   set the currently selected item to Blue codepre  pHowever, because the control lpColour in this example has an Event on SelectionChanged, two events get fired one with Red selected as the box is populated, then another when Blue is selected. I dont want to process the SelectionChanged at this moment only when the user has interacted with the control themselves eg. if they select Custom, I can reveal a separate textbox and give that focus but I dont want to do that when Im setting up the page and they had Custom previously selected, as otherwise the user gets the keyboard appearing as soon as they open the Settings page...pli liSimilarly, Ive found that ToggleSwitch controls will fire Checked and Unchecked events when the IsChecked Property is changed to something new.  Again, is there a way to ignore or suppress this event when changed by code  I kindof got around this for now by just using Clicked, but from a learning standpoint, itd be nice to know how to deal with it.li ul  pI was thinking maybe there was some way to get the origin eg. code or user input of the Event from the SelectionChangedEventArgs or RoutedEventArgs... but maybe notp  pI also tried setting an initialized bool value false by default, set to true after Constructor is run, and wrap the Eventhandling code in something like if initialized  ...  but the event still seemed to be fired after the Constructor was done for the lpColour.ItemSource... and lpColour.SelectedIndex  1 code that was done while initialized was false.  Very strange. Pp  pI hope Im explaining that clearly  Ive never posted here before  p  pId appreciate any help you could offer.  Thanksp  pstrongUPDATEstrong  thanks to MyKuLLSKIs answer, thats given me a great place to work from.p  pAs a side note, building on the idea, I tried keeping them as Lists initially and having the IgnoreSelectionChanged as an int that would count down so before setting the ListPickers ItemSource, Id set IgnoreSelectionChanged2 to account for the two events that would get fired similarly Id set IgnoreSelectionChanged just before setting the SelectedIndex manually... that seemed to work too.p  pHowever, using the ObservableCollection bound to the ListPicker and relying on that to tell of changes seems perhaps a better way than using the ListPickers own SelectionChanged event, so Ill modify my code to use that instead.p  pThanks againp

Negative 152 pIs it possible to catch an exception thrown from one thread in another thread For example, I am spawning a thread from my main thread. The spawned thread may throw uncaught exceptions. Is it possible to have the spawning thread catch these exceptionsp  pOne solution would be to catch the exceptions from the entry point of the spawned thread and handle the exception by posting an codeNSNotificationcode. Then, the spawning thread can listen for these codeNSNotificationcodes. However, this solution seems a little corky because its basically reimplementing the catch clause given different types of codeNSExceptioncodes as a parameter. I wanted to check if any other solutions are available.p

Negative 152 pIve looked at a bunch of other questions and theyre not exactly what I need. Im trying to set a NSTextField to a certain string based on the name of the file. I want to create a plist file with all the possible names of the file and their keys to set the NSTextFields string as. But I dont know how to have it check the plist for the items and if its not there I want it to execute the code to leave the text field blank. Before I had if statements saying that if the filename equals this then make it say this but I couldnt get the else part to work and only one if worked. So I thought Id have it check the plist but I dont know how to do that and use it with an ifelse statement. This is what I had beforep  precodeNSString inputName  [input stringValue] NSString theFileName  [[inputName lastPathComponent] stringByDeletingPathExtension]  if [theFileName isEqualToString0383698001]      [key setStringValue7ed37d8c051da8f8d31b0ccf0980fa5ffa54770c7e68ecb5ebf28abe683cadf21a4a99ed]   if [theFileName isEqualToString0383763001]      [key setStringValuea31ffd506c6711c5a0c52c9f0a2f7208a2f63ad9dd40506e70d80ea20a981eb1312bc774]  else      [key setStringValue]  codepre  pEDIT I have it checking the plist for the key but now I need it to get the value for the key from the plist.

Negative 152 pI recently found an example of using codestatic member functionscode in codepure abstract classescode to initialize pointers to objects of its derived classes.

For instancep  precodestdvectorltstduniqueptrltShapegt gt vect codepre  pand then we could add the derived classes in the container by either calling the static member functions of the codeShapecode classp  precodevect.pushbackShapedefineCircle10 vect.pushbackShapedefineRectangle5, 4 codepre  por directly without any interfacep  precodevect.pushbackstduniqueptrltShapegtnew Circle10 vect.pushbackstduniqueptrltShapegtnew Rectangle5,4 codepre  pWhich of both two ways of adding a derived class in a container should be preferred and whybr The full code can be found in the following a hrefhttppastebin.comMfsw6vNT relnofollowlinka.br Any lights on it are really welcomed p
Negative 152 pWhile reading up on POSIX threading, I came across an example of threadspecificdata.  I did have one area of confusion in my mind...p  pThe threadspecificdata interface looks a little clunky, especially once you mix in having to use pthreadonce, the various initializers, etc.p  pIs there any reason I cant just use a static stdmap where the key is the pthreadself id and the data value is held in the second part of the stdpairp  pI cant think of a reason that this wouldnt work as long as it was wrapped in a mutex, but I see no suggestion of it or anything similar which confuses me given it sounds much easier than the provided API.  I know threading can have alot of catch22s so I thought Id ask and see if I was about to step in... something unpleasant p

Negative 152 pIve encountered some issues with a .NET component that I am writing that is intended to be exposed to COM. p  pThe class to be exposed inherits from a base class, both of which have ComVisible properties set to true. Theres really nothing special about the base class  its contains 2 properties that I use to help abstract some database code.p  pI can register the assembly and type lib just fine. However, as soon as I attempt to instantiate the class, I get the following exception thrown from the callee p  pError in IDispatch.Invoke 0x80020101p  pI decided to debug it in CScript.exe and I was getting the same error. So I rewrote the class without the base class, and now I can create instances without issue.p  pIs there additional work I need to do in order to expose a .NET class that inherits from another .NET class in the same namespace p

Negative 152 pI have a setup with 2GB of memory and I would like to map 1GB or more of physical memory into user space virtual address. It is in theory possible since with 32bits setup, 3GB of virtual address is available to user land apps.p  pI updated the kernel command line with the following parameters mem1G memmap1G1G to force the kernel to see 1GB of RAM and to reserve the last 1GB. p  pI have my custom driver that will handle the user space mmap call and map the physical address 0x40000000 1G to user space address with the function remappfnrange. But the function triggers a kernel BUG in remappterange. The same call used to work with a 300MB remap instead of 1GB.p  pI usually use to call ioremap in my driver to map physical address into kernel virtual address. In this case, I cant because of 1G3G virtual addresses split 1G for kernel, 3G for apps. So I was wondering if it is possible to map physical address into user space virtual address without mapping these physical address in the kernel p  pThanks in advance.p

Negative 152 pstrongCore Questionstrongp  pI need help coming up with a concept to achieve my goal.  I am having a problem coming up with an idea to how I can navigate the DOM properly with the method I have chosen.  p  hr  pstrongThe Goalstrongp  pYou should know what I am doing firstp  pI use ajax to call HTML content into a codeltsectiongtcode element of my template.  I then call from those HTML contents an codeclasspageNavcode tagged element that holds the sub navigation for it and copies it to a codeidsubNavcode located in the main template. I do this when the new content is being called from the onStateChange event with thisp  precodefunction subNavContent           var navContent  document.getElementsByClassNamepageNav[0]      document.getElementByIdsubNav.innerHTML  navContent.innerHTML  codepre  hr  pNow the issue I have with doing this is I must assign the proper array value to achieve thisp  precode i is the current content pages sub navigation navContent  document.getElementsByClassNamepageNav[i]   codepre  pTo be more clear the codeclasspageNavcode are loaded into the DOM only when the user calls the page content, this is what specifies codenavContent[i]code position.  So this is my dilemma.  p  pExample Home page is loaded codecontentNav[0]code location. Contact is loaded by user next this would be codecontentNav[1]code location for the codeclasspageNavcode.p  hr  pstrongThe real questionsstrongp  pIs there was some way I could pass the array value of the page as its loading into the DOM like in my example or notp  pCould I maybe delete the codeclasspageNavcode contents from the DOM after it copies to reset the array value of codeclasspageNavcode to codenavContent[0]code when it is ran for the next pagep  hr  pstrongFurther efforts with my ideastrong I have being toying with this idea but with no success.  What I was thinking was to delete codeclasspageNavcode for that content from the DOM after it is transfered like sop  precodefunction subNavClear        var wrap  document.getElementByIdcontentBody     var nav  document.getElementsByClassNamepageNav[0]     wrap.removeChildnav  codepre  pso the resulting functions would be initiate in this orderp  precodesubNavContent        subNavClear   codepre  pI thought this would allow me to not worry about the array value of codecontentNav[0]code.

Negative 152 pI have an ASP.NET MVC3 project that uses Entity Framework 4.3 with the codefirst approach. I use Migrations to keep the database uptodate.p  pThe project is under sourcecontrol and I have a number of branches. What I just realized is that there will be a problem when I want to merge one of my branches into the master. Since I have created migrationfiles in both branches, there will be overlapping migrations when I merge, which will probably cause conflicts.p  pIs there a good way to manage Migrations in a project with multiple branchesp  pstrongUpdatestrongp  pOne way would be to merge, then delete all migrationfiles created while the branches were separate, and then create one new migration file that holds all changes from the time the branch was created until it was merged back in. This would work for the devenvironment where you can dump the database and rebuild it with all the migrationfiles. The problem then would be the liveenvironment. Since you couldnt roll back to the time the branch was created without the risk of loosing data, there will be a conflict when you try to use your new migrationfile to update the live database.p

Negative 152 pI might sound lazy but I am slightly confused on how to proceed on this subject. I have followed a hrefhttpwww.learncocos2d.com201204enablingarccocos2dprojecthowtostepbysteptutorialguide relnofollowthis guidea which is very well done.p  pMy goal is to convert the Cocos2d v1.x game project to Cocos2d v2.x and then refactor the project code to ARC.p  pTo get started I created an empty HelloWorld Cocos2d v2.x project and created the v2.x static library as from Steffens guide. I then rafactored the code to ARC and the HelloWorld worked smoothly.p  pThe issue is when I try to add to the same project the classes I had already written that dont complain to ARC assuming that there will be not many Cocos2d v2.x vs v1.x problems  e.g. use of deprecated methods and classes like TouchJSON  my project doesnt at least as far I can see. So, I added a couple of Game classes that dont depend from the rest of the game to reduce the number of potential Cocos2d v2. Vs v1 issues to the project to see if the ARC covnersion worked for those as a proof of concept. After adding them I choosed EDITRefactor option from XCode.p  pBut now the compiler gives me some ARC warning messages like ARC forbids explicit message send of autorelease in the following methodp  precodereturn [[[self alloc] init] autorelease] codepre  pOr similar problems with the dealloc method already written.p  pI was assuming that EDITRefactor would have changed the added code but it appears to work only once. Any hint on this strongshould I add all my code to the new project template before refactoring the codestrong p  pEDITTo verify whether it was an XCode bug I created an empty iOS project with no Cocos2d libraries and then converted it to ARC. Then created a new empty sublcass of NSObject and added a dealloc method and run the conversion again, it did work So I might have not followed correctly some of the steps to create and link to the static library.. p  pIn addition to this there are some other small issues not XCode related, but Cocos2d v2.x related, like the fact that the strongCDXPropertyModifierActionstrong is not automatically included to the CocosDenshion folder and I had to add it to the project after creating the static library when I noticed the issue.. but I guess this is more template creation related.p  pThanks for readingp

Negative 152 pIm writing a program in emMathematicaem that relies on patternmatching to perform payroll and warrant of payment verification. The crux of the problem is to compare different data files both CSV and XLS to make sure they contain the exact same information, since pay is handled by two different thirdparties.p  pMy use of emMathematicaem makes development of the program quite streamlined and fun, but is prohibitive on a distribution level. CDF format is not an option, since the program requires the user to import data files, something which WRI does not permit in CDF.p  pAn ideal programming language for this task would enable me to pack it up as standalone, for OS X, Linux or Windows, as well as being able to do the patternmatching. Support for GUI primitive or extensive is also needed.p  pI thought of Python to translate my program in, but Im not sure if its a good bet.p  pWhat suggestions do you havep  hr  pMy only understanding of patternmatching is a hrefhttpreference.wolfram.commathematicaguideRulesAndPatterns.html relnofollowthata which the emMathematicaem a hrefhttpreference.wolfram.commathematicaguidePatternMatchingFunctions.html relnofollowdocumentationa has taught me.p  pAn example of a task that emMathematicaem handles perfectly is the following p  pImport XLS file, sort data by dates and names, extract certain dates and names. Import CSV file, sort data by dates and names, extract certain dates and names.p  pCompare both, produce a nice formatted output containing desired missing information.p  pNavigating through the data in emMathematicaem is also pretty easy and intuitive.p

Negative 152 pWhen I deserialize an object graph by restoring all each node and edges by object itself for objectoriented way, I found theres serious dependency problem.p  pFor example if an object codeAcode references itself codeAcode, self circular reference it means, it expects itself codeAcode in emcomplete original stateem while it is restoring. Because it was in that state when it was being serialized.p  pFor selfreferencing case, it can be detected because it knows itself is being restored. But if the codeAcode needs another object codeBcode, it should expect the other object codeBcode in complete original state too. If the object codeBcode also references codeAcode, now theres circular reference to  codeAcode again, and it becomes equal problem without knowing the codeAcode is now being restored. strongIf codeBcode wants to use some property of codeAcode while deserialization, it is not guaranteed to be exist.strongp  pFundamentally, this problem happens because an object needs complete state of the other objects though itself is in incomplete state. This doesnt make sense. I have thought about dividing restoring process into multiple phases, but it doesnt make any real difference because actually the object will remain in incomplete state until all phases finish.p  pCan I have some advise or good solution for this problemp  pPS. I started coding this to make some replacement for Cocoas codeNSKeyedArchivercode. So I assumed encoding of object is done by the object itself. for its internal state So it could be different with general graph problems. But I cant exclude hidden state that can be get by the object itself...p

Negative 152 pIf JQuery calls elements that dont exist, what is the overhead for this  It throws no errors, but other than loading the script is there much cpu overhead  Does it matter if this is done for a class or an idp  pFor caching reasons and reasons of keeping simultaneous connections at a minimum I keep all my onload scripts for every page in one file, but I was wondering if it would be efficient or not to tell my javascript which page it is on and load only the bits of code that would be actually ran on that page via if statements or switch statements.

Negative 152 pThreadSafety is not an aspect that I have worried about much as the simple apps and libraries I have written usually only run on the main thread, or do not directly modified properties or fields in any classes that I needed to worry about before.p  pHowever, I have started working on a personal project that I am using a codeWebClientcode to download data asynchronously from a remote server.  There is a codeQueueltUrigtcode that contains a prebuilt queue of a series of URIs to download data.  p  pSo consider the following snippet this is not my real code, but something I am hoping illustrates my questionp  precodeprivate WebClient webClient  new WebClient private QueueltUrigt requestQueue  new QueueltUrigt  public Boolean DownloadNextASync      if webClient.IsBusy         return false      if requestQueue.Count  0         return false      var uri  requestQueue.Dequeue      webClient.DownloadDataASyncuri      return true   codepre  pIf I am understanding correctly, this method is not thread safe assuming this specific instance of this object is known to multiple threads.  My reasoning is codewebClientcode could become busy during the time between the codeIsBusycode check and the codeDownloadDataASynccode method call.  And also, coderequestQueuecode could become empty between the codeCountcode check and when the next item is dequeued.  p  pMy question is what is the best way to handle this type of situation to make it threadsafe  p  pThis is more of an abstract question as I realize for this specific method that there would have to be an exceptionally inconvenient timing for this to actually cause a problem, and to cover that case I could just wrap the method in an appropriate codetrycatchcode since both pieces would throw an exception.  But is there another option  Would a codelockcode statement be applicable herep

Negative 152 pI am trying to introduce a staging step in my companys codeproduction process. We currently have 10 eng clients who commit code individually, update local codebase  debugcheck locally, then we deploy the code to production environment and have other employees QA. Obviously we would like to have a better preproduction test process to help catch bugs before they go live to the public. p  pMy first attempt is to create a staging environment on an extra ubuntu box with the most recent committed code from the eng clients. I then could allow the Product Managers to check this site and find bugs, test features, expose bottlenecks, etc. p  pWhat I have The ubuntu machine local server is currently configured as a normal eng client. It has a local drupal installation, complete backup of the db, and all of this is accessible locally. Lets go with mysite.com  official site and the local staging domain I use on the ubuntu box  ms.com. This local ms.com works just fine, so in essence, I need to just allow other people at the company to navigate to some URL and it acts the exact way ms.com currently behaves. I have DNS servers pointing to the ubuntu box and it is running some side projects out of the www folder. p  pIn an effort to keep the side projects running, I think my solution is to create a namebased virtual host that points to the directory of the local drupal installation. Is this the right thing to do to achieve my goals Is there an easier way to open up this local config to the employees. p  pIn trying to set up the virtual host I did the followingp  pI added the static ip address of the local server to etchosts  I added a virutalHost to etcapache2sitesavailable with the DocumentRoot dirDrupalInstallation I added a2ensite  Then restarted apache. p  pHalfway success. I can get to the main page, but none of the modules load, I tried loading more hostsvariations, started changing all localhost references to the external, but I dont really know what the underlying issue is and I do not know how to diagnose it. The one interesting bit is that if you click on some of the links, it kicks you back out to the index page of the www folder  I dont think the site alias is 100 sticking for requests. p  pLet me know if there is any sort of log or report I can share to help diagnosedebug this. Any and all help greatly appreciated  thanks p

Negative 152 pI am on Rails 3.2 and I am using rspec 2.11.1. When I run my test suite with rake spec I get failures. When I run it with rspec everything passes. Ive seen other mentions of this problem but nothing definitive that explains what is going on and what best practices are.p  pIf I do rake spec or rake tmpclear ampamp rake spec my tests fail.p  pIf I do rspec or rspec spec or rake dbtestprepare ampamp rspec my tests pass.p  pI thought the only difference was that rake did dbtestprepare but if I do that manually before running rspec my tests pass so that cant be all of the story.p  pAfter doing a bit of reading I changed my Gemfile. Previously I had it set up as per The RSpec Book p328 where it described putting the rspec gem inside a group development, test block. Having read some other SO posts I removed development and did a bundle. Now rake spec does nothing. rspec still works as before.p  pVery confused...p

If I am supposed to save the context of r0 and pop it off after then there is no way to return the result, the only way it can be done is by corrupting the first argument. Is there a workaround somehow Thanks in advance guysp

Negative 152 pa hrefhttpsgithub.commrdoobthree.jswikiHowtorunthingslocally relnofollowhttpsgithub.commrdoobthree.jswikiHowtorunthingslocallya suggests that three.js examples be served by a local server. The python SimpleHTTPServer works fine for me, except that I need to run it in the directory above the strongexamplesstrong dir in the three.js repository clone.p  pNow Im trying to serve up the same example using httpServer in node.js. I could use one of the node versions of SimpleHTTPServer, but I need a httpServer object to pass data from the server to the webgl browser example via socket.io. So I took the socket.io example and tried the following strongserver.jsstrong to be run using node in the directory above strongexamplesstrong. p  precodevar app  requirehttp.createServerhandler   , io  requiresocket.io.listenapp   , fs  requirefs  app.listen8080  function handler req, res    fs.readFiledirname  exampleswebglinteractivevoxelpainter.html,   function err, data      if err        res.writeHead500       return res.endError loading html           res.writeHead200     res.enddata      io.sockets.onconnection, function socket    socket.emitnews,  hello world    socket.onmy other event, function data      console.logdata     codepre  pNet is that on 127.0.0.18080 with node I cant see the three.js example. The code doesnt work even if I remove all references to socket.io, indicating its something about html. p  ol lipWhat am I missing The html file is being read properly because I dont get a callback error. pli lipI noticed that the python server lists the directory as html links in the browser. I click strongexamplesstrong to see the html files, then click the html file and it works fine. So I tried running the node server.js one directory level up, with just about every combination of forward and backward slashes, root directory references,... to no avail. pli lipIm not hung up on pure httpServer. If express or something else works with socket.io and three.js, Ill board that train.pli ol

Negative 152 pSo Im trying to implement some memory management techniques here. In my program, I created an stl list so that it would contain objects of the class Blast with its respective iteratorp  precodelistltBlastgt blasts listltBlastgtiterator it1 codepre  pIve looked around and found that if you use the erase function, it will call the destructor of the class, and then delete the iterator to which it points to the object and return some other pointer iterator. However, if the class is a POD, then the call for the destructor wont do anything, hence all the information that was saved in that object will be kept in memory.p  pTo go around this, I tried to allocate the object dynamically so that I could use the delete function to wipe it out of memory as suchp  precodeBlast blast blast  new Blast codepre  pHowever, here I encountered a problem. When i tried to push the object onto the list, it only lets me push the pointerp  precodeblasts.pushbackblast codepre  pAt first, I didnt think anything about it. So I continuedp  precodeifit2gtgetX gt 600      delete ampit2    it2  blasts.eraseit2      codepre  pI realized then, that what this does is that it erases the pointer that was pointing to the object, and then the pointer that was pointing to the pointer pointing to the object.p  pIm not entirely sure if that is actually correct, as I have no way of knowing if theres a memory leak. So my question is thisp  pWhat do I have to do to erase the object from memory BEFORE deleting whatever pointer is pointing to that object Is my implementation correct Is its result the same as if I were to just simply push the object onto the list p

Negative 152 pIm fairly new to SQL Server, so if anything I say doesnt make sense, theres a good chance Im just confused by something. Anyway...p  pI have a simple mapping table. It has two columns, codeBeforecode and codeAftercode. All I want is a constraint that the codeBeforecode column is unique. Originally it was set to be a primary key, but this created errors when the value was too large. I tried adding an codeIDcode column as a primary key and then adding codeUNIQUEcode to the codeBeforecode column, but I have the same problem with the max length exceeding 900 bytes I guess the constraint creates an index.p  pThe only option I can think of is too change the codeidcode column to a checksum column and make that the primary key, but I dislike this option. Is there a different way to do this I just need two simple columns.p

Negative 152 pIm working on a dashboard for my colleagues that shows a few stats from Google Analytics next to some other statistics. To get access to the Analytics data I use OAuth2. OAuth2 requires a scope to get send along with the authentication request in order to get access tokens. I created a client ID in the APIs Console that has access to Analytics, and specify the scope in an initializer that looks like thisp  precodeRails.application.config.middleware.use OmniAuthBuilder do   provider googleoauth2, ENV[ADMINDASHBOARDGOOGLECLIENTID], ENV[ADMINDASHBOARDGOOGLECLIENTSECRET],  accesstype online, approvalprompt , scope httpgdata.youtube.com,userinfo.email,userinfo.profile,analytics.readonly  end codepre  pThis uses the codeomniauthgoogleoauth2code gem, and the scope I found in an example somewhere. However, for my implementation, I think this scope is strange. Instead of codehttpgdata.youtube.com,userinfo.email,userinfo.profile,analytics.readonlycode I would like to use codehttpswww.googleapis.comauthanalytics.readonlycode, but changing to that scope causes the request to return codeinvalidcredentialscode. What is the correct way to specify only access to analytics data is neededp

Negative 152 pI have worked previously on data driven website using asp. net and sql server. This involved retrieving records from the database and showing on the webpage. Now, I have some folders on server which have xml files. I have to create an Asp website that searches with folder names and retrieve other information from the particular xml file which is selected. I assume this will be easier if it is in database .mdf so that it can be accessed using sql server and through stored procedures to access the information in xml files..p  pNow the question is how to convert the xml files on server to .mdf to perform search operations on my asp website.. please guide me .. and one more thing is the folders will be updated daily...so,need something which does conversion during retrieval .. please guide me with best possible wayp

Negative 152 pI am trying to understand how events can cause a memory leak. I found a good explaination at a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions3662842howdoeventscausememoryleaksincsharpandhowdoweakreferenceshelpmitithisa  stackoverflow question but when looking at objects in Windg, I am getting confused with the result. To start with, I have a simple class as follows.p  precodeclass Person              public string LastName  get set          public string FirstName  get set           public event EventHandler UponWakingUp         public Person              public void Wakeup                      Console.WriteLineWaking up             if UponWakingUp  null                 UponWakingUpnull, EventArgs.Empty               codepre  pNow I am using this class in a windows form application as follows.p  precodepublic partial class Form1  Form              Person John  new Person  LastName  Doe, FirstName  John           public Form1                      InitializeComponent              John.UponWakingUp  new EventHandlerJohnUponWakingUp                   void JohnUponWakingUpobject sender, EventArgs e                      Console.WriteLineJohn is waking up                   private void button1Clickobject sender, EventArgs e                      John  null             GC.Collect             GC.WaitForPendingFinalizers             GC.Collect             MessageBox.Showdone                codepre  pAs you can see, I instaniated Person class and subscribed to UponWakingUp event. I have a button on this form. When user click this button, I set this Person instance to null without unsubscribing to the event. Then I call GC.Collect to be sure that Garbade collection is been performed. I am showing a message box here so that I can attach Windbg to look references help by Form1 class and within this class I dont see any reference to that event Windbg output is shown below although Form1 has too long data, I am displaying related to my question.  This class has a reference to Person class but it is null. Basically this does not seem like a memory leak to me as Form1 does not has any reference to Person class even thouh it did not unsubscribed to the event. p  pMy question is if this does cause memory leak. If not, why not p  precode0005gt do 0158d334    Name        WindowsFormsApplication1.Form1   MethodTable 00366390   EEClass     00361718   Size        3320x14c bytes   File        cSandboxWindowsFormsApplication1WindowsFormsApplication1binDebugWindowsFormsApplication1.exe   Fields         MT    Field   Offset                 Type VT     Attr    Value Name   619af744  40001e0        4        System.Object  0 instance 00000000 identity   60fc6c58  40002c3        8 ...ponentModel.ISite  0 instance 00000000 site   619af744  4001534      b80        System.Object  0   static 0158dad0 EVENTMAXIMIZEDBOUNDSCHANGED   00366b70  4000001      13c ...plication1.Person  0 instance 00000000 John   60fc6c10  4000002      140 ...tModel.IContainer  0 instance 00000000 components   6039aadc  4000003      144 ...dows.Forms.Button  0 instance 015ad06c button1    0008gt DumpHeap mt 00366b70      Address       MT     Size   total 0 objects   Statistics         MT    Count    TotalSize Class Name   Total 0 objects   codepre

Negative 152 pMy question isnt necessarily on how to do this  rather Id really like to know where to start. Ive made a program in Java that keeps track of a dart game. I have a core codeDartGamecode class and classes for the different games that inherit it. From there it keeps track of players, whos turn it is, the current score, etc. It works great now what I want to do is make it into an Android app. I have a server program on my computer that would link the running apps. I dont want a global server that can be accessed anywhere because I dont want to spend the money on a VPN server, so the server program would just run on my PC. An example of a similar type of server would be like the one used for AndroMouse which allows you to control the cursor on a PC with an Android device.p  pWhat is the best way to make the connection from the device to the PC Im not sure if it uses a MAC address or the WIFI from my router, or even Bluetooth is an option. Im not really familiar with Android but I assume there would be some sort of ServerServerSocket connection, but that requires an IP address and Im not sure which one to use. Is it as simple as using the local IP from my router Like I said Ill learn how to do it on my own, Id just like to know what I need to learn before I spend a bunch of money on Android books. Thanks in advance.p

Negative 152 pI have been trying for a while now to use the Verify option in Selenium as opposed to the Assert option. My thought being that with a Verify option is that my test can be run completely and then to get a list of the errors. In trying to do so I have realized that code wise the Verify option is the same as Assert but it is just surrounded by the trycatch block.

Negative 152 pI want to read XML Schema files in Java and store them in a database. Practically, I would like to do this using an Object Model so I used XSOM but it takes nearly five minutes to walk through the object model and write stuff to the database where needed. The actual writing to the database takes less than 5 seconds in the overal scheme of things, so I suppose its a performance issue with XSOM.p  pI know theres an alternative from Apache XmlSchema but would the performance be any better there I have my doubts. Or should I use an XML parser since schemas are also valid XML documents Im guessing XML parsers are more common and thus better developedp  pIdeally, I would use a SAX parser but because components in the XSDs can refer to components that I passed by earlier, or components that I have yet to pass by, that is not an option since I would like to store those references to other components in the database as well. For instance, an element could refer to a ComplexType in its type attribute. That complex type might be defined later down in the document.p  pAre there any suggestions In general, the way XSOM was built actually worked pretty good for me but I really need to boost the performance.p

Negative 152 pFrequently, I have found, users enter very poorly formatted names when they register.  I get all kinds of crazy formatting from Paypal IPN and other payment gateways even from all lower case to all caps to just flat out messed up.p  pOne thing I do with this information is to send out emails and offer greetings, however I dislike the poorly formatted names.  Has someone thought about this before and figured out a happy middle road solution  For example, I realize it would be poor form to simply correct spellings that are seemingly errors, but it would be wise to at least fix what is reasonable.  At the minimum that would be capitalization.  Perhaps simply upcasing the first letters of each distinct word in the first and last name strings would be sufficient  p  pOr is there a a better method  Perhaps a database of common name capitalizations for things like McBerry and van Buuren  A gem or some such tool  Just kind of curious.  Perhaps it is foolish to put this much thought into this topic, but I really like to be as courteous and professional as possible in my communications with users vs just using a poorly formatted name as is the usual.p

Negative 152 pI have a codeUIToolbarcode in my iOS app that I rotate programmatically in the codewillRotateToInterfaceOrientationcode function using a codeCGAffineTransformcode.

Negative 152 pOkay, I am not a database architect, so this question is completely coming from a software developers point of view.  I am currently working to get a simple settings database and was wondering what is the most efficient, performant way to store different types in SQL server.  For example, SettingA can have a boolean, int, float, or string value.  What is the most efficient way to store that data and the most performant to retrieve.p  ol lipStore all types in one field that is a string and have the application server convert it to its proper value.pli lipHave different fields for different types and have the application server see which field is not null and use it BooleanValue, StringValue, IntValue, FloatValue and have only one be nonnull and with a valuepli lipNormalize the settings into different tables based on types and only add value to the table if that type is used.  Four tables BooleanValues, StringValues, IntValues, FloatValues with a foreign key to Settings table.  SP would then return whichever table has a record.pli ol  pPerformance is definitely my 1 concern, but space concerns would be a close second.p

This is implemented by calling codegetBatteryStatuscode method in the constructor where codegetBatteryStatuscode does the followingp    pre classlangjava prettyprintoverridecodepublic static void getBatteryStatus         timerBattery  new Timer        taskBattery  new TimerTask            public void run                UiApplication.getUiApplication.invokeLaternew Runnable                    public void run                        if DeviceInfo.getBatteryLevel10                           try                             String freeTextBattery level at 10                             sendBatteryStatusfreeText                          catchException e                                                                                   timerBattery.scheduleAtFixedRatetaskBattery, 0, 20000  codepre  pThe codesendBatteryStatuscode sends the message to the server and cancels the timer. This in effect has sent the message once to the server as requested. p  pHowever, what if the user starts charging its handset with the App running as it was without the constructor being called again How will the timer then restart How will I be able to send the message to the server again next time p  pWhat is the best mechanism to prevent sending multiple messages of battery level at 10 and in effect send a message ONLY once followed by messages being sent again when the battery level is at 10 the next time p  pIf I do not cancel the timer once the message is sent, the message to the server is sent more than once.p

Negative 152 pIt is wellanswered on this site that Bram Cohens patience diff is found in bazaar as the default diff and as an option with git diff, but I am finding it difficult to source an independent standalone program that implements this particular diff algorithm. p  pFor example Id like to apply patience diff to perforce diffs, and its pretty clear with the canonical frobnitz code example how patience diff is better p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comI1PnI.png altenter image description herep  pThe terminal on the right has invoked the codegit diffcode with the codepatiencecode flag. p  pI also have set up the codediffhighlightcode perl script, whose job it is to invert colors on matchedup lines between the first and last different sections of those lines. The left side has an example where this doesnt quite help so much but Ill let it slide because at least there emisem that semicolon there... Anyway, making improvements to the diffhighlight script is not the subject of this question.p  pIn addition to the question of where to find a standalone patience diff, if anybody knows how to make perforce codep4code use an external diff program, thats also something that has to be done. p

Negative 152 pI have some data in a mongodb database and want to pass it to a backbone collection when I load the home page.

Negative 152 pHave a strange issue where about 15 of the time, when selecting a cell with a UITableView the cell highlight flashes quickly and didSelectRowAtIndexPath is not called.  The rest of the time it is working fine. p  pTested how it was being selected fast  slow finger nail, etc, but this does not seem to be the case.  Looks semirandom.p  pAny thoughts one what might be causing thisp  pIOS 6.xp  p[Addition] Thanks for the comments so far.p  pIf while clicking the mouse simulator is moving, the problem can be duplicated.  Even if the table is set to .scrollEnabled  false it is still happening.  Also, the didHighlightRowAtIndexPath does fire and the didSelectRowAtIndexPath does not in the quick case.  p  pSame thing happens on IOS 5.x also...p  p[Conclusion]p  pWell, it turns out that the scrolling was turned off for the table and it seems to be even more picky with the moving tap  Turning the scrolling on actually made the moving tap less picky.  There were a couple of other postings that I just found that pretty much said the same thing.  This is a strange conclusion for a table view that has scrolling disabled and produces a quick highlight with no selection.  Looks like this is why they added the didHighlight in IOS 6 to try and get around this issue.p

Negative 152 pI was working on backing up a machine at work today and noticed that after a couple of different attempts to get the password right, windows took much longer to check if the password I put in was the correct one, going from 1 second to  10 seconds. If anyone knows how Windows looks up the password information and has an explanation thatd be great. Im genuinely curious if this is due to some other process that takes place or if Windows just hit some random error. For info this was on Windows 7 but Ive seen it on other versions as well. Thanksp

Negative 152 pIm currently working on a rather complicated eCommerce site that is running on NetSuite. The core of NetSuite relies heavily on Javascript and I have implemented a fair amount of custom Javascript myself.p  pMost recently, Ive implemented some code using Maxminds GeoIP database to determine a users location and take actions based on that location. The idea is to block certain countries from purchasing items, redirecting them to a countryspecific page and notifying them that there is a distributor available in their country. I know this is probably not the best way to do things, but these decisions, for a variety of reasons, are not up to me.p  pSo, heres what I have going on. When the page loads, it runs the Maxmind script to determine the users location and sets a cookie so I dont have to keep prompting for their locationp  precodevar geoCheck  function        var location  getCookiecountry      var onSuccess  function geoipResponse          countrycode  geoipResponse.country.isocode          if geoipResponse.country.isocode              countrycode  US                  setCookiecountry,countrycode,365          return           var onError  function error          countrycode  US           if location  null ampamp location            return function              countrycode  location               else          return function               geoip2.country onSuccess, onError                 codepre  pThen, when the user clicks the Add to Cart button, this function gets run to determine if the user is browsing from one of our restricted countriesp  precodefunction countryCheck      if countrycode          switch countrycode              case CN                 redirect stuff                 return false             case TW                 redirect stuff                 return false             ...and so on for about 6 countries total...                  return true      else          return true          return true  codepre  pstrongTHE PROBLEMstrong Since I implemented this code, the client has consistently been fielding calls from government users using Internet Explorer saying that they cant add items to their cart.

Negative 152 pSometimes Visual Studio does not allow me to set breakpoints in MVC views.  This has happened to me scores of times, but it doesnt happen for every view and I dont know why.  p  pWhen you click on the lefthand bar to place a breakpoint, it places a white circle instead of the normal red circle.  The message when you hover over it is The breakpoint will not currently be hit. The source code is different from the original version.  It goes on to describe how to allow breakpoints to be hit, but that produces strange results and I dont want that anyways.p  pIf the error is correct, then I want to run the original source code.

Negative 152 pIf I want to initialize views programmatically, where in the viewcontroller lifecycle should this happen p  pThe initial intuition is strongloadViewstrong. However, here, we dont yet have the frame of the view itself necessary for calculating the sizespositions of the views. Ditto for strongviewDidLoadstrong. p  pNext intuition is strongviewWillAppearstrong here we DO finally have a guarantee of the frame of the view. However, this has potential to be called many times throughout the vc lifecycle. Ditto for strongviewDidAppearstrong, etc...p  pFinally, I found strongviewWillLayoutSubviewsstrong. This works for the initialization of most static layouts however, whenever any view moves this gets called again same problem as strongviewWillAppearstrong. p  pIve seen recommendations to init the views in strongloadViewstrong and set their frames in strongviewWillLayoutSubviewsstrong since setting frames should be idempotent, who cares if it gets called a couple times. But then why does apple so strongly encourage eminitWithFrameem as the standard initialization method of UIViews a hrefhttpsdeveloper.apple.comlibraryiosdocumentationwindowsviewsconceptualviewpgiphoneosCreatingViewsCreatingViews.html relnofollowhttpsdeveloper.apple.comlibraryiosdocumentationwindowsviewsconceptualviewpgiphoneosCreatingViewsCreatingViews.htmlap  pWould it be crazy to subclass all my UIViewControllers to have an eminitWithViewFrameem method That way I can pass in a frame, manually set it immediately in strongloadViewstrong and be done with it Or is it better to have a strongviewHasBeenFormattedstrong flag in strongviewWillAppearstrong that, if not set, calls the formatting of views and then sets itp  pOr is this just apples way of saying use interface builder or youre screwedp  pAny help is appreciatedp  pemstrongeditemstrong accidentally wrote loadView where I meant viewWillAppear in final paragraphp  pemstrongupdateemstrong  I guess Ive come to terms with the fact that there is no place wherep  ol liThe frame is confidently knownli liThe code will only be run once on setupli ol  pLooks like youre expected to eminitWithFrameem all your views in strongviewDidLoadstrong but then I guess the contents of that view shouldnt treat that frame as even remotely final because how could it be when it was derived on an assumption ugh.... Then reset their frames in stronglayoutSubviewsstrong. And make sure to manually handle the differences between initial layout and layout as a result of a moved view there... Man I feel like Ive GOT to be missing something... lol denial...p  pI guess that, OR submit and use IB.p  pemstrongupdate2emstrong viewWillLayoutSubviews WILL get called when one of its subviews is resized.

ASP.NET Identity uses Entity Framework Code First to implement all of its persistence mechanism.p      pIf your application requirements are that this information might be stored in a different storage mechanism such as SharePoint, Azure Table Service, No Sql databases etc. it is now possible to plug in different storage providers.p blockquote  pBut how can one use the Azure table service with this My research shows that you cannot use the entity framework with the table service, so I think youd have to replace the code that uses the entity framework entirely, but Im not sure.p  pRelated question Im new to EF in general.

Negative 152 pMy question is two fold. First, I have to evaluate the version of PostgreSQL in order to run the correct query. I have some servers running PostgreSQL 8. and they have issues with using codeDOcode in my query below.

Negative 152 pIm trying to determine the best way to transfer data through a socket between a client and server. Currently I have a BufferedReader that reads one character at a time or however many characters have arrived since the last iteration. Through each iteration, it pulls the data received so far and puts it into an array. When the  character is read, it knows that the current instruction is done.p  pI know what I have so far is grossly inefficient and burns the CPU, but Im a little unclear as to the differences between all the ways to read from a socket input stream. What would I use to not have to read each character at a time, but rather to wait until the input stream is finished receiving the current instruction which would be terminated by np

Negative 152 pHere a beginners question.p  pIs there any difference in JAVA between passing an object as argument to a method or returning that object from the method. For instance Is it better to pass a List as an argument and fill it in the method or just allow the method to return a listp  pMy guess is that it should be no difference since a reference is returned and nothing is copied. But is there something more subtle behindp  pthanks in advancep  pAltoberp
Negative 152 pI am using PrestaShop 1.5.6.0. I cannot get a carrier to appear for order placement No carrier has been made available for this selection. I would be really grateful if someone can tell me what is wrong.p  pI have now spent almost 10 hours checking every menu for anything that seems even remotely like it could prevent the carrier from being available.p  pUnder ShippingCarriers there is a carrier that came with the installation named First Class Mail which is enabled. Under ShippingShipping I selected First Class Mail as the default carrier.p  pThe country that was specified in the shipping address is enabled via LocalizationCountries and the zone for the specified country is enabled in LocalizationZones. LocalizationStates has all stated enabled the address is in the United States.p  pThe product dimensions amp weight are configured for the product being ordered and are within the ranges configured for First Class Mail carrier. Group access is checked for all groups visitor, guest, customer for this carrier. The zone for the destination address is checked in Shipping Locations and Costs for the carrier for the single range that is configured 0 to 1000 lb.p  pWhen adding a new product or editing an existing product, under Shipping, there is a dropdown list of carriers containing ALL the carriers listed under ShippingCarriers, both enabled and disabled. There is also a button that says Unselect All. There is no apparent indication whether a carrier is selected or not in the dropdown, so I dont know if any of them are selected. Clicking Unselect All does not seem to do anything and there is NO method to select a carrier only Unselect. In case Unselect All did indeed remove all carriers for the product with no feedback or indication that this was done, I created another product where I did not click Unselect all.p  pThe only shippingrelated module I have enabled is Shipping Estimate and there does not appear to be anything in its configuration that enablesdisables carriers.p

However, I will have the use case where codecompAcode will be used in another area of the application.p  pMy first thought with reuse in mind was to simply reuse the views and create a new module where ever this particular view was needed. However, the unique events and actions that come with this view are stored in the controller and API to interact with the module.p  pSo I have ended up with the following structurep  precode    application.js     apps     dashboard     compA     compB codepre  pand I have implemented something like the following to reuse functionality from codecompAcodep  precodeController       getView function           return new Show.MyView        API       getMyView function           return Controller.getView        App.reqres.setHandlercompagetview, function       return API.getMyView  codepre  pDoing this allows me to request a new instance of the view to display and keep the same action logic. However, this means that there is no separation between each section codecompAcode in the dashboard, and codecompacode in another section of the app. So if I were to stop the codecompacode module it would not have the desired results.p  pIs there a better approach to reusable modules with minimal duplication of code p  pMy thought was to extract the Controller logic into a controller object that I can extend, and then creating a new sub app when I would like to reuse the features. p  precode    application.js     apps     dashboard     compAdashboard  new instance of Controller     compAsomewhereelse  new instance of Controller     compB codepre  pIt seems as though I may be overcomplicating my design pattern.p

Motion continues placing integers on the field until after it has placed an integer on the edge of the field.emp  pstrongmain.cstrongp  pYour assignment is to write a C program that first reads in a single line of input which contains the integer samples. main then reads in samples lines of test data.

Negative 152 pHi we are currently working on kendo UI Scheduler and wanting to make the scheduler real time using SignalR.p  pWhat we are trying to achieve is if 2 customers are viewing the scheduler at the same time and client 1 makes a booking the 2nd client will see that someone has booked that particular time slot so that double booking does not occur. p  palso if a client makes a booking on the scheduler then the admin will also see the booking in real time.p  pcurrently we have the scheduler inserting to the database with no problem, from there we want to broadcast the newly created booking to all others who are viewing the scheduler at that time.p  ol lican this be done if so any ideas.li ol  pi can supply code to what we have done upto now if need required.p  pmy thoughts are to broadcast the new scheduler booking in the ActionScript method then broadcast the new booking to clients from there.p  precode      public ActionResult TasksCreate[DataSourceRequest]DataSourceRequest request, TaskViewModel task               if ModelState.IsValid                      using var sampleDB  new SampleEntities                                              Create a new Task entity and set its properties from the posted TaskViewModel                 var entity  new Task                                      TaskID  task.TaskID,                     Title  task.Title,                     Start  task.Start,                     End  task.End,                     Description  task.Description,                     RecurrenceRule  task.RecurrenceRule,                     RecurrenceException  task.RecurrenceException,                     RecurrenceID  task.RecurrenceID,                     IsAllDay  task.IsAllDay,                     OwnerID  task.OwnerID                                  sampleDB.Tasks.Addentity                 sampleDB.SaveChanges                 task.TaskID  entity.TaskID                         i was thinking to broadcast the new booking here using signalr          return Jsonnew[]  task .ToDataSourceResultrequest, ModelState        codepre

Negative 152 pI have three columns of dates.  The first contains the start date, the second is a date for when a 2month review is due and the third is the date that review is completed.   I then set conditional formatting to turn the dates that are overdue 5 DaysRed and 15 DaysYellow from current date this part works.  Now what I want to do is turn a date that is red or yellow to green if a date is entered in the third column.  I can do each individual cell, but there is too much information to individually add a rule to each cell in the column.  Highlighting a single cell and adding the rule Cell Valueequal tooGreen will work but again, there are too many cells in the columns.  If I highlight the entire column and try add the rule it will not let me and states that a must only apply it to a single cell.br I then tried to add a rule by formula that if this cell is empty then it will turn it green.  This isnt working.  I am not sure what to doI thought about a macro that would remove conditional formula if the dates matched up or I could even highlight it a different color if it was completed late.br It might be best to explain what I will be using it forwe have people working and they are due performance reviews.  I would like to open the spreadsheet and see visual which ones are due by color coding their importance.  Then changing that warning color to a good color green so I know its been completed.br PLEASE HELPp

Negative 152 pIm trying to make a dashboard application, and Im trying to create the layout rules for it and such and Im not sure the best way to go about it. Originally I had a custom grid control, so I could add my custom controls to it easily enough. It worked in the sense that if you initially put stuff there, it was fine. But I want to implement a drag and drop facility in it and it kinda doesnt really like that. p  pThe biggest annoyance is just detecting what position my mouse is on in terms of what row and column its in in the grid. So So I thought instead of a grid, I could use a Canvas, and just manually measure the grid slots. But Im not sure if theres a better way. Id like to mimic how on android, you can have widgets for the home screen and you can drag and drop them around the screen. Id like it to just be like that essentially. p  pWhen dragging, Id like have a green rectangle move instead of the thing and make it red if it overlaps with something else. Like I said, basically just like how android widgets work. Id love some code examples since Im new to WPF. If youve got any more general suggestions as well, that would be well appreciated.p  pThank youp

However, I cannot calculate the hash as I do not have the salt, which is stored in the database.

Negative 152 pIm new to Android development, trying to build an app that utilizes Samsung BLE technology to detect when an Android phone is within range of other mobile devices generating a BLE signal. I tried to get the proximity PXP sample app working from a hrefhttpdeveloper.samsung.comble relnofollowhttpdeveloper.samsung.comblea. The site says to Please use the global Google BLE API for Android versions 4.3 and later. Im running 4.4.2 on a Galaxy S5, and Im not sure how to get this app working. I tried downloading the recent API versions 20 and 21 and building on Eclipse with no luck. Im getting a bunch of errors saying that my BluetoothGatt classes cant be resolved. Any ideas how to get this working And is it even possible to get my Samsung device to transmit a BLE signal to be picked up by similar devicesp

Negative 152 pAfter one hour of trying to figure this out with multiple version of jquery I give up. I have a navigation menu which has a logo in the center I need the logo to always be a circle. Since the layout is responsive I set the height of the logo based on the width that has been generated for it. The problem is that whenever I change the viewport size the logo moves out of place height wise and I have no clue on how to maintain it.p  pHeres the a hrefhttpjsfiddle.netehxptLft42 relnofollowJSFiddlea p  pa hrefhttpjsfiddle.netehxptLft42embeddedresult relnofollowFiddle result hereap  pCurrently there are 5 buttons in the navigation menu so each button has 20 width.

In fact the loop will run forever. p  pSSE behaves strictly according to IEEE754 when f reaches 16777216.0 and we add 1.0 to this value f  1.0f we still obtain  16777216.0 in xmm2 register, then we store it to memory. p  pf  eps  f expression is computed on the FPU. Since FPU registers have enough precision feps results in 16777217.0. If we stored this result back to memory into float variable then we would get expected value 16777216.0 since 16777217.0 is not represented as float. And f  eps  f would be false and loop would terminate. But we do not store any numbers back to memory and perform comparison  on the FPU since we have both operands. It means that we compare one number that is computed strictly according to IEEE754 f and another that is computed with 80bit accuracy feps. 16777216.0  16777217.0 and the loop runs forever.p  pIm not an expert in this area but for me it looks like that doing floating point with SSE instructions is more robust as was demonstrated in C version of the program.p  h3Updateh3  pI had a discussion on the D forum a hrefhttpforum.dlang.orgthreaducnayusylmpvkpcnbhghforum.dlang.org relnofollowhttpforum.dlang.orgthreaducnayusylmpvkpcnbhghforum.dlang.orgap  pIt turned out that program behaves correctly  its according to the language specification that intermediate calculations can be performed with higher accuracy.p  pThe robust implementation for any D compiler isp  precodeimport std.stdio int main      const float eps  1.0f     const float step  1.0      float f  0.0f     float fPlusEps  f  eps     while f  fPlusEps              f  step         fPlusEps  f  eps          writelneps  , eps, , maxf  , f     return 0  codepre

I dont get why. Hence, the codeonEnteredcode and codeonExitedcode events do not work as expected, because codeonExitedcode happen inside the codeMouseAreacode when the codeToolButtonscode are stronghoveredstrong and tooltips are shown. In the end I need the codeMouseAreacode to be a bit wider and longer than its parent codeRectanglecode so that once codeonExitedcode is emitted the codemenucode gets invisible. After the test with codeRectanglecode is successfull it will make sense to make C type Polygon.p

Negative 152 pWe have 18 table join which is typical for ERP systems. The join is done via LINQ over Entity Framework. p  pThe join gets progressively slower as more joins are added. The return result set is small15 records. The LINQ generated query is captured via SQL Profiler and when we run this via Microsoft Management Console it  is very fast  10ms. When we run it via our C LINQoverEntityFramework it takes 4 seconds.p  pWhat i guess is happening The time it takes to compile expression tree into SQL is 2 seconds out of total 4 seconds, and another 2 seconds i guess is spent internally to convert SQL result set into actually C classes. Also it is not connected to initialization of entity framework because we run some queries before and repetitive calls to this join produce same 4 seconds.p  pIs there a way to speed this up. Otherwise we are considering abandoning Entity Framework for being absolutely inefficient...p

Negative 152 pRegarding to my a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions29286178contentonparticularmemoryaddressisdifferentthanwasexpectedingdbpreviousa post about displaying memory in gdb I was told that the int data type is being stored with the leastsignificant byte first.

Negative 152 pI have a Gtk Drawing Area inside a Scrolled View. I have connected the Drawing Area to the draw signal and the image Im painting renders at times, e.g. when the window losesgets focus. But when it is scrolled by all possible means, e.g. mouse wheel, keyboard inside a scrolled view, or the parent window is resized, the draw signal is not always sent. The resulting effect is a flickering image, that is a sequence of the correct image to be rendered alternated by a blank gray in this case Drawing Area of the right size though. I managed to fix this issue by connecting to the scrollevent of the parent scrolled view the problem with resizing the window still remains though, but I believe this is not the right way to address this problem.p

The codeBeans Bindingcode library should be added to this project.p  pCreate the first class codeBindingDialog.javacodep  precodepackage bindingfailexample  public class BindingDialog extends javax.swing.JDialog       public BindingDialog          superjavax.swing.JFrame null, true         initComponents           private void initComponents          bindingGroup  new org.jdesktop.beansbinding.BindingGroup          buttonClose  new javax.swing.JButton         checkboxButtonEnable  new javax.swing.JCheckBox          setDefaultCloseOperationjavax.swing.WindowConstants.DISPOSEONCLOSE          buttonClose.setTextClose          org.jdesktop.beansbinding.Binding binding  org.jdesktop.beansbinding.Bindings.createAutoBindingorg.jdesktop.beansbinding.AutoBinding.UpdateStrategy.READWRITE, checkboxButtonEnable, org.jdesktop.beansbinding.ELProperty.createselected, buttonClose, org.jdesktop.beansbinding.BeanProperty.createenabled         bindingGroup.addBindingbinding          buttonClose.addActionListenernew java.awt.event.ActionListener              public void actionPerformedjava.awt.event.ActionEvent evt                  buttonCloseActionPerformedevt                                checkboxButtonEnable.setTextSelect to Enable Button          javax.swing.GroupLayout layout  new javax.swing.GroupLayoutgetContentPane         getContentPane.setLayoutlayout         layout.setHorizontalGroup             layout.createParallelGroupjavax.swing.GroupLayout.Alignment.LEADING             .addGrouplayout.createSequentialGroup                 .addContainerGap                 .addGrouplayout.createParallelGroupjavax.swing.GroupLayout.Alignment.LEADING, false                     .addComponentcheckboxButtonEnable, javax.swing.GroupLayout.DEFAULTSIZE, javax.swing.GroupLayout.DEFAULTSIZE, Short.MAXVALUE                     .addComponentbuttonClose, javax.swing.GroupLayout.DEFAULTSIZE, javax.swing.GroupLayout.DEFAULTSIZE, Short.MAXVALUE                 .addContainerGapjavax.swing.GroupLayout.DEFAULTSIZE, Short.MAXVALUE                  layout.setVerticalGroup             layout.createParallelGroupjavax.swing.GroupLayout.Alignment.LEADING             .addGrouplayout.createSequentialGroup                 .addContainerGap                 .addComponentcheckboxButtonEnable                 .addGap18, 18, 18                 .addComponentbuttonClose                 .addContainerGapjavax.swing.GroupLayout.DEFAULTSIZE, Short.MAXVALUE                   bindingGroup.bind          pack           private void buttonCloseActionPerformedjava.awt.event.ActionEvent evt                                                      dispose                                                       Variables declaration  do not modify                          private javax.swing.JButton buttonClose     private javax.swing.JCheckBox checkboxButtonEnable     private org.jdesktop.beansbinding.BindingGroup bindingGroup      End of variables declaration                     codepre  pThen add the following class codeLauncher.javacode to the same projectp  precodepackage bindingfailexample  import java.lang.reflect.InvocationTargetException import java.lang.reflect.Method import java.net.MalformedURLException import java.net.URL import java.net.URLClassLoader  public class Launcher      static public void loadUsingReflection          try              URL[] urls   new URLjarfile  ..BindingFailExampledistBindingFailExample.jar  ,                              new URLjarfile  ..BindingFailExampledistlibbeansbinding1.2.1.jar               URLClassLoader cl  URLClassLoader.newInstanceurls              Classltgt c  cl.loadClassbindingfailexample.BindingDialog             Object frame  c.newInstance             Method m  c.getMethodsetVisible, new Class [] boolean.class             m.invokeframe, true           catch InstantiationException  IllegalAccessException  NoSuchMethodException  SecurityException  ClassNotFoundException  IllegalArgumentException  InvocationTargetException  MalformedURLException ex                     public static void mainString[] args          Launcher.loadUsingReflection        codepre  pCreate another project class codeBindingFailExternalcode and add a copy of the class codeLaunchercode to it.

However, this is far from ideal as this represents the plugin requiring a change in the host application.p  pI am trying to determine what changes I might be able to make so the bindings work.  This might be a bugfix in the launcher albeit, this is a very stripped down example or a modification to the plugins manifest, etc. p  pOne more detail if I manually call coderefreshAndNotifycode, it indicates that the binding has synced.  Also, I am able to codegetcode the binding from the binding group and verify that it is bound.  And...if in BindingListener.synced the button state is changed, the binding listener fires again obviously resulting in a stackoverflow, but the point is that it fires.p

Negative 152 pSo just for fun I created a small little python script that prompts the user for a number and then prints out that many digits of the Fibonacci sequence.

Negative 152 pI have an adsupported app and a subscribe to Remove Ads feature.

That is, would an intermediate screen do the trickp  pAny ideas would be appreciatedp  pThank you.p

Negative 152 pstrongSituationstrongp  pIm writing a Winforms app using C in VS2013 with .NET4.0.p  pI have a datagridview which I bind to a DataAdapter linked to a MySQL table.   Im performing updates using the DataAdapters Update method.   Due to the unconventional handling of dates and booleans in the MySQL table I set my own SQL commands rather than using CommandBuilder.   These are fed by parameters set before calling Update.  I call Update on RowValidated.p  pFor inserting and amending this works fine.p  pstrongIssuestrongp  pIn the datagridview, when the user selects a single row, I want them to be able to hit delete and have the row removed from both the grid and the database.   When I try this the row disappears from the datagridview and of course the cursor moves to a different row.  But the emdatabaseem row that gets deleted is the new datagridview row that the cursor has fallen on.  This is almost certainly because I use datagridview.CurrentRow to set the parameter for the delete command and I assume that at this stage the current row has indeed changed. p  pstrongQuestionstrongp  pHow do I amend this arrangement so the delete will work correctly  Clearly the underlying issue is that the row has disappeared from the grid before the database update takes place but Im not sure how to resolve that.  I suspect the solution may lie in handling things through different events but Im not sure which.p
Negative 152 pI am making a program that will allow a user to create a certain modifiable list. The goal is to allow a user to create a schedule, which can be loaded and modified later.

They can then be accessed the next time the program is launched and the specific file is selected and opened in the program.p  pIs this possible If so, howp

Negative 152 pI believe that this error has something to do with a mismatch between my tiedlist and the hmmdefs as pointed out herea hrefhttpwww.ling.ohiostate.edubromberghtkproblems.html relnofollowhttpwww.ling.ohiostate.edubromberghtkproblems.htmla, but I can not seem to solve it.  All of the triphones in my corpus are present in my triphones1 list and triphones1 only contains monophones,biphones and triphones from my corpus. p  pIf I take said triphone out of the triphones1 list and recreate the tiedlist it passes but complains about another triphone down the road.  Obviously manually taking out all of these triphones would take me years and it doesnt seem efficient which leads me to believe that I have missed something further back. p  pIt is also important to note that all these triphones generating errors are in my corpus as well.  To me this error would only make sense if I had unseen triphones somewhere, but where  I feel that I have left no stone unturned but surely someone can give me a fresh idea of where to look.p

Negative 152 precently I picked up Cordova to write my application and after getting the entire frontend layout of the application completed, I started working on the backend. Some server side communication and Facebook integration and to my dissapointment I noticed some issues with the codengCordovacode plugin. These may be expected behavior however, but the lack of documentation is outstanding. p  pWhen attempting to login to facebook  using the p  precode cordovaOauth.facebookCLIENTIDHERE, [email].thenfunctionresult  codepre  pcode provided, you are redirected to the Facebook login through an embedded browser. However regardless as to if the user is logged into facebook or not, theyre still required to enter their username and password. This is highly irritating. It also spams the notifications of the users with the messagep  blockquote   pYour account has been logged in from a different device or browser. Please review this login now.p blockquote  pIve been looking through the source of codengCordovacode and I have yet to find a way to authorize an account with an usertoken. p  pstrongMy idea wasstrong that if I generated and stored a 60day usertoken on the users device I could reduce the amount of logins required drastically, however I have yet to find a way to validate a user based on their access token. To see if its still valid.p  pThe next idea was to store the users username and password locally, perhaps using SQLite and provide it upon login whenever its required. However that didnt seem to be possible. Coming from Unity3D where there was a codesingletouch signoncode feature, where the press of a button authorized the application, this login process is extremely overkill I feel.p  pIs there any way to shorten this process, or make it so the user doesnt have to enter their username and password everytime they execute the applicationp

Negative 152 pI need to add a UDPMulticast port receiver listener to a Matlab program that, in addition to the UDPport, collects and processes data from two other TCPIP ports in real time. Matlab has a builtin UDP function for Unicast UDP, with  callback functions BytesAvailableFcn and DatagramReceivedFcn, which allow fast and asynchronous data reading. Unfortunately, there is no such function for Multicast UDP in Matlab.p  pA workaround Javasolution has been previously posted on this forump  precodesocket  java.net.MulticastSocketDESTPORT socket.joinGroup java.net.InetAddress.getByNameMCASTADDR socket.setReuseAddress 1  packet  java.net.DatagramPacket         zeros1, intmaxuint16, int8, intmaxuint16  while true       socket.receivepacket    codepre  pThis solution works, but unfortunately it blocks other functions. Another simple but inefficient solution is to use a timer function. However, it would be much better to use some kind of a BytesAvailableFcn or DatagramReceivedFcn callback which allow asynchronous reading without blocking other functions. I am new to socket programming, and unfortunately, this part of MatlabJava interface is not well documented.

Negative 152 pI am posting data to a server from the client side using an AJAX call.

For example, when I print out the params on the server, it looks something like thisp  precode[data[][data1, data2, data3], count 3, units[][unit1,unit2]] codepre  pWhereas it should look likep  precode[data[data1,data2,data3]....] codepre  pThe problem I have with these square brackets is that when I try to use a command object for validation of the data, then the data binding cannot take place as the variable names within the command object do not include the square brackets and I of course cant create a variable name in Grails to include these bracketsp  pDoes anyone know why these brackets are being added to the keys in the object when it is the value that is an array and not the key itself and what I can do to circumvent this problemp

Negative 152 pI have a base class K and A, B, C models extend from K, using STI in rails. p  precodeclass K lt ActiveRecordBase   hasmany x, classname X end class A lt K end class B lt K end codepre  pAnother model X has codekidcode as foreign key and an enum field codekindcodep  precodeclass X lt ActiveRecordBase   belongsto k   validatespresenceof kind   enum kind [kinda1, kinda2, kinda3, kindb1, kindb2, kindb3]  and so on end codepre  pThe codekindcode field values are strictly mapped to type of model K. So, model A will havemany X but of type can be only any one of [kinda1, ... kindan], and so on.  p  pHaving a X object codexcode , I can tell what type of K, it belongs to A,B or C.  And for model K, I can tell what available kinds are present for its new x object based on type.p  pI need to put validations such that object of model B cannot have codexcode object of kind kinda1, etc.  Also, theres a model P which hasmany Ks of all types. p  precodeclass P lt ActiveRecordBase   hasmany x, classname X   hasmany a, foreignkey kid, classname A   hasmany b, foreignkey kid, classname B end codepre  pMethods in P behave differently based on type figuring out type of K from the kind of X.p  pcodeP.addthisxtok x code So, strongthis method will add x to A,B or C depending on kind of x.strongp  pObviously, codekindcode is mutually exclusive for K types. So, A and B will not share same kind of Xs. Otherwise, P.addthisxtok wont work. p  pNow, my problem is how do I implement such design in Rails.  I can think of maintaining a config.yml file which can tell me what codekindcodes  are available for a X that belongs to ABC. p  precodeA   kinda1   kinda2 B   kindb1   kindb2 codepre  pValidations for X would go like p  precodedef validatekindforK     errors.addkind, kind not available for K type unless  if config[A].include kind  end codepre  pIs this a good way  I feel weird about this approach, so what improvements or better way to design such a logic. If this solution works, how do I get type of K depending on kind of X. p  pEdit Basically i have kind enum in X. X belongsto K. A lt K. B lt K. Xs kind enum if K is type A is smaller exclusive set S1, S2 if K is type B etc. So, enum kind  S1  S2  more. enum values will keep on increasing in future. How to implement such logic  p

Negative 152 pI just switched from a Windows laptop to a Macbook Pro. I have installed vim and macvim using homebrew. Everything works fine with macvim, but in the command line, the vim exhibits weird behaviors. p  pFirst, the cursor in the Insert mode which I suppose should be simply a line is the same as the Normal mode which is a rectangle, making it impossible to tell the current mode from the cursor shape. I dont know whether this is normal with vim in the command line because I didnt pay attention before. But this is certainly different from the behavior of macvim and it helps to distinguish the shapes of the cursor in different modes. p  pSecond, the backspace does not work appropriately. It often cannot delete letters in the Insert mode. p  pI am totally new to OS X, so I would greatly appreciate it if someone can give some hints on how to solve these issues.p  pThanksp
