Positive 5769 pI have to write the server side of an Android application. I dont know much actually, anything about Android development. If an application has the login via Facebook icon, what happens emexactlyem on the serverp  pI assume the app, after authentication, would contact the app server and tell it I am Facebook user ID XXXXXX but whats stopping the app from saying so Wont the server need to hear that the application is authenticated emdirectlyemp  pThe normal way, with a Facebook login button on a web form, its more natural as the app redirects to Facebook, and then Facebook redirects back to the application once login is successful or not. But... what happens with a stand alone application, effectivelyp  pPlease note that I am after the emserverem side of things.p

Positive 5769 pI am working on a REST API in PHP Codeigniter and trying to implement oauth 2legged authentication for the API access. The API is to be accessed using a pair of credentials that a developer will use in the coding when integrating our API with a website or mobile app ,so there is no end user authorizing the website or mobile app.p  pThe oauth 2legged authentication doesnt seem to fit our purpose,actually I am a bit confused. What I have implemented so far seems to be Oauth 0legged if you can call it that. I am just oauth signing HMACSHA1 the request using consumer secret and an empty access token.

Positive 5769 pI am adding spring security oauth2 to my spring boot application.  I have followed a few of the examples on the web and in github from the spring team had to make some mods for my use case, but I am still not able to return an oauth2 access token from the oauthtoken endpoint.  I have been working on this for several days and started off trying to do it in JavaConfig, but then switched to xml config and was able to make some progress.  I should note the only config I am doing in xml is the security config and related security beans, all other config is done via JavaConfig.p  pI am able to successfully authenticate my user using username amp password using Basic auth, but when it comes to the next step to generate and return the bearer token, this is not happening.  Note, I am using a database for storing my user credentials and to store my access tokens once they get created. p  pI am making a POST request using granttypepassword with a client id and client secret.p  pI am under the impression spring oauth2 would handle creating the access token for me and returning it, but maybe this isnt correct or my xml config maybe wrong Many thanks for any

Positive 5769 pIm writing an AngularJS app that talks to a php api. Is there a way to prevent users to make api calls directly, without going through the Angular app that sits on one particular domain. So they have to visit my domain, where the angularjs sits, and only make calls to the api through the Angular app. I know because its client side that all code is inspectable. My app has a public part, and a part thats only available after user login. So I could easily secure the calls after user login, through OAuth or JWT, but I want to secure the entire thing, including the public part that doesnt need user login.p  pIs this actually possiblep  pThanksp
Positive 5769 pI have an OAuth2 server and client. I want to keep the token life short 15 minutes for security reasons. So what the client does is before requesting, it checks if the token is expired and refreshes it then does the request. Its pretty seamless. The user doesnt see any of this. My problem now is I cant implement ajax page loading because the cookies which saves the access token isnt refreshed without a page refresh. Is there a way around this One thing Im doing now is have some actions saving use page refresh while others dont.p

Positive 5769 h1Overviewh1  pI am building a RESTful API application as mobileweb backend lets call it MyBackendApp and Im looking for a contemporary solution for both Authentication AND Authorization of app users. Primary language for backend is Java. Looking at other apps, many of them offer several auth methods to user using external to app account e.g. Facebook, Google, Yahoo, OpenId etc. or internal emailpassword.

Positive 5769 pI am trying to implement OAuth2 into my Spring Boot app.  When making a call to oauthtoken using a password grant, I am able to authenticate using Basic auth with a usernamepassword against a database.

This ultimately results in an authentication failure at the TokenEndpoint.postAccessToken method e.g. oauthtoken.p  pIs it expected that the OAuth2AuthenticationProcessingFilter would be called during a oauthtoken call  If not, any ideas why If it is expected what is the best fixwork around for this issue, to set stateless on the OAuth2AuthenticationProcessingFilter to false  Not sure if that is a good idea or not...p  pSome relevant info, I am using xml config for my spring security settings and JavaConfig for the rest.

In the AppDelegate are the methods codeapplicationDidFinishLoadingcode and codeapplicationWillTerminatecode.  In those methods, I am loading and saving the application data, and storing it in an instance variable it is actually an objectgraph.p  pWhen the application loads, it loads MainWindow.xib, which has a NavigationConroller, which in turn has a RootViewController.  The RootViewController codenibNamecode property points to RootView my actual controller class.p  pIn my class, I wish to refer to the object that I created in the codeapplicationDidFinishLoadingcode method, so that I can get a reference to it.p  pCan anyone tell me how to do that  I know how to reference between objects that I have created programmatically, but I cant seem to figure out to thread my way back, given that the middle step was done from within the NIB file.p

Negative 5769 pIm considering using AMQP using qpid to enable a mixture of Python and Java services communicate with each other. Basic text messaging seems simple enough but, as with every other messaging technology Ive investigated, thats where it seems to stop. Except for building instant messaging applications, I would have thought sending strings wasnt a particularly useful thing to do yet example after example demonstrates sending unformatted text around.p  pMy instinct then is to use XML deserialization or something similar JSON, YAML, Protocol Buffers etc. which has good library support in both languages. Is this a best practice and, if so, which deserialization protocol would people recommend Or am I missing the point somewhere and should be quite content sending small bits of textp

Negative 5769 pI am currently working on a localization project for an ASP .NET application. I currently have a massive page with a multi view with about 9 tabs with each tab containing lots of data.

Negative 5769 pHow can database views be tested in Rspec  Every scenario is wrapped in a transaction and the data does not look like it is being persisted to the database MySQL in my case.  My view returns with an empty result set because none of the records are being persisted in the transaction.  I am validating that the records are not being stored by setting a debug point in my spec and checking my data with a database client while the spec is being debugged.p  pThe only way I can think to have my view work would be if I could commit the transaction before the end of the scenario and then clear the database after the scenario is complete.  Does anyone know how to accomplish this or is there a better wayp  pThanksp

Negative 5769 pI have been trying to create a web page that will redirect the user after he has watched a video or if he aborted the playback. Ive got this working on the iphone but cant really figure out how it works on the android.p  pOn the Iphone i have found two ways of doing this. using the  tag to embed the quicktime plugin and then adding a event listener with javascript to listen to the qtended event. This does obviously not work on android because there is no quicktime plugin. p  pThe second thing i tried was using the html5 tag and listening to the ended event, again this worked on the iphone but to my surprise not on android. In this case i got the video playing on the android phone but no redirect occurred after the video had reached the end. So my guess is that the android browser does not fully support the videotag and that it does not fire the event.p  pSo at this time i dont really know how to proceed. Im guessing i could do something similar to the quicktime embed solution but using a plugin available on android. But i cant find any information on what plugins is available on the android and if they support some kind of endedevent. p

Negative 5769 pThis isnt a emrealem fluent interface. I have an object which builds up a method stack. Which gets executed by a single function call. But now I might add another virtual method, which takes over that method stack.p  hr  pUse case Im wrapping my superglobals into objects. This allows me to enforce input filtering. GET and co provide simple sanitizing methods. And my new version now allows chaining of atomic filters. As examplep  precodeGETgtasciigtnocontrolgttext[field] codepre  pThis is a method call. It uses angle brackets. But thats just a nice trick which eases rewriting any occourence of codeGET[field]code. Anyway.p  pNow there are also occasionally forms with enumerated fields, as in field[0],field[1],field[2]. Thats why Ive added a virtual array filter method. It hijacks the collected method stack, and iterates the remaining filters on e.g. a POST array value. For example codePOSTgtarraygtint[list]code.p  pSomewhat shortened implementationp  precodefunction execchain data      ...     while filtername  arraypopthisgtfilter      ...         data  thisgtfiltername data     ...   function arraydata      listmultiplex, thisgtfilter  arraythisgtfilter, array     data  array data     foreach arraykeysdata as i          thisgtfilter  multiplex         data[i]  thisgtexecchaindata[i]          return data  codepre  pThe method stack gets assembled in the codethisgtfiltercode list. Above execchain just loops over it, each time removing the first method name. The virtual array handler is usually the first method. And it simply steals that method stack, and reexecutes the remainder on each array element. Not exactly like in above example code, but it just repeatedly repopulates the original method stack.p  pIt works. But it feels kind of unclean. And Im thinking of adding another virtual method codegtxorcode. YAGNI Which would not just iterate over fields, but rather evaluate if alternate filters were successful. For example codeREQUESTgtarraygtxorgtemailgturl[fields]code. And Im wondering if there is a better pattern for hijacking a function list. My current hook list thisfilter swapping doesnt lend itself to chaining. Hmm well actually, the xor example wouldnt need to iterate  behave exactly like array.p  pSo specifically, Im interested in finding an alternative to my thisfilter list usage with arraypop and the sneaky swapping it out. This is bad. Is there a better implementation scheme to executing a method list half part me  half part youp

Negative 5769 pI created a Git repo on a server and want it to be used by several people, i.e. users which belong to the same Unix group. It also has a working copy because it may be useful for us to have a common working copy.p  pThus I set the owning group of that Git repo directory to that Unix group.p  pThe problem is, every time someone is pushing to that repository, the new filesdirectories have the owner set to the username of that user and his group but not our common group. Also, all those new filesdirectories become coderwxrxrxcode.p  pI tried codegit config core.sharedRepository groupcode but that doesnt really work. It now makes filesdirectories as coderwxrwsrxcode but is has still the wrong group set.p
Negative 5769 pI have a strongly typed mvc page which I wont to bind a unorder list to a list of objects.

The problem is I want to add and remove from this list on the client side.  So I might have some js which adds and extra list item and removes the current.  This means I have to somehow manage the indexes in the name and keep them in order and non duplicate on the client side.  Does anyone know if there is a way to get around using the index in the name.p  pThanks in advance.p

Negative 5769 pIm writing a formbuilder for our CMS which dynamically loads bespoke controls into panels within a repeater.p  pThe bespoke controls all inherit from, lets say 5arx.FormBuilder.FormControl, a base class which defines abstract methods for initialising, validating, repopulating, gathering submitted data from them. Controls range from simple text fields to complex, composite clientside controls.p  pIt all works very well, but Ive noticed something I feel is anomalous. During the course of writing code to retrieve form controls. gather their data and persist it to my database I noticed that their type reverts to the way objects get typed if you write your code in the v. irritating VS website project mode.p  pSo, for example a control that is defined as living in a namespace and being of typep  pstrikecode5arx.FormBuilder.FormControl.MyBespokeControlcodestrike     Sarx.FormBuilder.FormControl.MyBespokeControlp  pat runtime reports its type via simple call to GetType as being of typep  pstrikecodeASP.5arxFormBuilderFormControlMyBespokeControlcodestrike     ASP.SarxFormBuilderFormControlMyBespokeControlp  pGetting the BaseType property will correctly retrieve the underlying class, but it is perplexing to me why this should be happening. Particularly as I spent much of the summer refactoring our app from its original form as VS Website project complete with shared code in the AppCode folder and other nastiness to the IHMO correct web application project  supporting claass libraries so that we would have control over our namespaces and not get everything compiled into the ASP.x namespace p  pI would really appreciate some explanationclarity.p  pEDIT Modified the hypothetical example root namespace.p

Negative 5769 pEdit Turns out, I was misled during my initial explorations of the accessibility APIs. Once I found the secure text field in the AX hierarchy, I was easily able to set the value. Not sure what to do with this question beyond that, but I wanted to update this for future searchers.p  pIm working on some code that will post keyboard events to targeted applications using the Accessibility APIs. So far, I have been able to write a trivial app that allows me to type in a string value and then post keyboard events with those key codes to the targeted application. In reality, the strings would be read from another location.p  pWhat I have not yet been able to figure out is how to ascertain whether and which modifier keys should also be posted. For instance, when I type codeHello, worldcode into my test application, the input is sent to the other application as codehello, world1code because I am not yet including the modifier keys to create the upper case H and the exclamation point. This is made doubly complicated by multikeystroke characters like codecode or codecode. Sending codecode sends  a raw codeecode with no accent for example.p  pIs there a simple method I am overlooking for discerning the modifiers to combine with a keycode for creating a particular NSString or unichar If not, does anyone have a suggestion of how to proceed So far, the best I have come up with is calling codeUCKeyTranslatecode with all possible modifier combinations until I find one that matches the codeunicharcode I get using code[NSString characterAtIndex]code Im not sure this is scalable or reliable, though, given the multikeystroke nature of some characters as noted above.p  pThanks in advancep

Negative 5769 pI hope someone can answer this question.p  pHow does the UuidCreateSequential method in the rpcrt4.dll class use to seed its guidsp  pI know this much Microsoft changed the UuidCreate function so it no longer uses the machines MAC address as part of the UUID. Since CoCreateGuid calls UuidCreate to get its GUID, its output also changed. If you still like the GUIDs to be generated in sequential order helpful for keeping a related group of GUIDs together in the system registry, you can use the UuidCreateSequential function.p  pThe reason behind the question is.  If I use this function to generate sequential GUIDs in a web cluster, how can I ensure that the GUIDs are close to a range of GUIDs without the potential of the GUID being duplicatedp

It only worked on IE and involves heavy use of XML and XSLT.p  pWhen the page loads, content is dynamically placed inside a div using XSLT and XML preprocessing.

When the user makes a selection in the select box, it mirrors the steps when the page first loaded XSLT, via an XML object and an XML file.

The XSL file appeared to be okay so, I went back to testing if the XML was, somehow, corrupt.  As it turns out, the XML editor was able to transform the XML file using the XSL file.  I can say the XML file does contain english and eastern asian language characters, encoded as UTF8.  But IE was able to parse and transform it, as well as the XML Editor.  So, perhaps Firefox has a problem with the XML Files UTF8 encodingp  pHaving no answer to this problem, I tried thisp  precodeif window.DOMParser    var serializer  new XMLSerializer   var XMLString  serializer.serializeToStringXMLImage   var parser  new DOMParser   var XMLImageAgain  parser.parseFromStringXMLString, textxml   var Works  .transformasyncfalse, xmlobjXMLImageAgain, xslxslImageData.xsl var AlsoWorks  .transformasyncfalse, xmlstrXMLString, xslxslImageData.xsl  Works  Works.replaceampquotg, Works  htmlfixed.replace.gif.g,1  document.getElementByIdDivContent.innerHTML  Works codepre  pWhat I did was serialize the XML to a string.  Then, I parsed the string and attempted to convert it back to a XML DOM object.  For some reason, it stayed a string. As a result, emWorksem takes the value of a string.  AlsoWorks takes the value of a string, as well, but this is the desired result.  Whats odd is after I transformed the XML and passed it to emWorksem, most of the quotation symbols got messed up and some some other data was appended to the end of the image Im retrieving .gif.  Because emWorksem is a string, I could not use the appendChild method to attach it to the DOM tree.  I was left with no choice but to use innerHTML, which I did.p  pAll this time and energy because the project Im working with is entrenched with XML and XSL files.p  pI found that this blog also documents difficulties with FireFox and XSLTXMLXSLp  pa hrefhttpajaxandxml.blogspot.comsearchlabelFirefox relnofollowhttpajaxandxml.blogspot.comsearchlabelFirefoxap  pIt works now, but Im still scratching my head.  In the beginning, I mentioned it works in IE just fine.  And, perhaps more importantly, it works in strongBOTHstrong FireFox and IE the first time I attach content to the div, which is upon initialization of the page.  Its only on subsequent times I am attaching content to the div that FireFox doesnt cooperate and Firebug doesnt help much, nor does it report errors, unlike IEs web devleoper toolbar.  And upon initialization, Im not even using jquery, just native DOM.  And, yet, when I used sample XML and XSL file pairs from the jquery transform plugi, those worked fine.  Its only when I use both my XML and XSL files together that it complains again, not when the page first loads.  The strange thing is it wouldnt transform the XML object, but after I serialized it, the transformation worked fine.p  pToo many questions.  I say its probably FireFox and not the XML or XSL, because if the XML and XSL files were at fault, then the transformation should fail when the page loads and, yet, it does not.p  pI sure as heck would love to know why appending the object to the div didnt work but serializing the object to a string and setting it to the innerHTML property, after transformation, passed with flying colors.p  pstrongUPDATE4strongp  pIn my XSL file, I placed the first two templates in a separate XSL file and am using the xslimport feature, instead.  This broke it again.  So, FireFox and jquery transform plugin do not respond well to the xslimport feature IE has no issue with it.  I tried using the sample XML and XSL files from the transport plugin, the example which specifies how to use xslimport, and it failed in firefox.p  pstrongUPDATE5strongp  pI refactored the code, such that it does not use jquery, to investigate if xslimport will fail.p  precode Test for Firefox only, purposely not including IE code function TransformNodeTestxmlobj, xslpath    var xslobj  LoadXSMLxslpath   var xsltProcessor  new XSLTProcessor   xsltProcessor.importStylesheetxslobj   returnxsltProcessor.transformToFragmentxmlobj, document  function LoadXSMLxslpath    var xhttpnew XMLHttpRequest   xhttp.openGET,xslpath,false   xhttp.setRequestHeaderPragma, nocache   xhttp.send   return xhttp.responseXML    ImageData.xsl contains xslimport statement  XMLImage is an XML obj var FireFoxHTML  TransformNodeTestXMLImage, xslImageData.xsl codepre  pIt worked fine.p  pConclusions for replacing XMLXSL content in div with XMLXSL contentp  pjquery transform pluginp  pIE Works fine no issues with xslimport feature in xsl file.p  pFireFox Does not like xslimport feature for some unknown reason to me.  My stopgap, until a better solution comes along, is copypaste all XSL statements into one file and not use xslimport.  Also, need to serialize the XML obj and, optionally, parse it back to an XML object to transform.  Why does serializing fix it  I do not know.p  pXML DOMp  pIE Works fine no issues with xslimport feature in xsl file.p  pFireFox No issue with xslimport feature.

Negative 5769 pIm working on a final project for a C programming course. The project is to create a database to store drug information. Ive completed all of the elements and now its down to fine tuning everything.p  pTheres a requirement in the project in the function where the user can change the drugs information. In the requirement, the user should be able to skip a field by hitting enter. For example, the user can change the producer of the drug and the quantity. If the user didnt want to change the producer, theyd hit enter and move onto the quantity.p  pIve looked around the internet and was able to let the user skip entering a string for the producer. However, I cannot get it work with an integer.p  pThis is what I used so that the user can skip entering a stringp  precodescanf30[n], fentry[found].producer codepre  pFor clarity sake, fentry.producer is a string with 30 characters and found is an integer variable.p  pIve tried doing something similar with the integer input EDIT By integer input, I meant the one to enter the quantity, not the found varible. It will let you skip entering something, but if you do enter something, it stores a random value.p  pAnyone know how to go about thisp

Negative 5769 pim really new to jsf. I need to enable,disable, render or not render some buttons on a page depending on the logged user privileges. The page is bound to a request scoped managed bean , i bind the rendered or disabled attribute of the commandbutton to a visible property of the managed bean, and an actionlistener to a managedbean method which has the only purpose to navigate to another page. If i bind one of the above properties to the visibile property, the navigation method doesnt get called, and the same page gets rerendered with the button disabled or not rendered. The more urget need is the answer to how do i disable or hide the button of course, But , since i guess the problem is due to jsf page life cycle and the bean scope, id like also to be direct to some tutorial a bit more advanced than the hello world that can be found around.p  pbelow are part of the code.

Negative 5769 pI am diving into my first forays with CQRS and Event Sourcing and I have a few points Id like some guidance on. I would like to implement a SO style reputation system. This seems a perfect fit for this architecture.p  pKeeping SO as the example. Say a question is upvoted this generates an codeUpvoteCommandcode which increases the questions total score and fires off a codeQuestionUpvotedEventcode.p  pIt seems like the authors User aggregate should subscribe to the codeQuestionUpvotedEventcode which could increase the reputation score. But howwhen you do this subscription is not clear to me In Greg Youngs example the eventcommand handling is wired up in the global.asax but this doesnt seem to involve any routing based on aggregate Id.p  pIt seems as though every User aggregate would subscribe to every codeQuestionUpvotedEventcode which doesnt seem correct, to make such a scheme work the event handler would have to exhibit behavior to identify if that user owned the question that was just upvoted. Greg Young implied this should not be in event handler code, which should merely involve state change.p  pWhat am i getting wrong herep  pAny guidance much appreciated.p  pstrongEDITstrongp  pI guess what we are talking about here is interaggregate communication between the Question amp User aggregates. One solution I can see is that the codeQuestionUpvotedEventcode is subscribed to by a codeReputationEventHandlercode which could then fetch the corresponding User AR and call a corresponding method on this object e.g. codeYourQuestionWasUpvotedcode. This would in turn generated a user specific codeUserQuestionUpvotedcode event thereby preserving replay ability in the future.

Negative 5769 pIm using EF 4.1 and still trying to figure out some of the details. I have a parentonechildmany relationship in the database. The EF object that represents that child has a property that represents the one parent. I explicitly set the child.parentId FK field and then I can do a context.Addchild, followed by a context.SaveChanges and the child record with the correct parent foreign key shows up in the database. All is good as far as the db is conerned. p  pHowever, while the in memory child object gets updated correctly with things like the PK  identity column that parent Property field remains null. I was surprised by this, is this normal Once the record is created and I come back into the app, the navigation to the parent always works. It just appears that right after the child is created the parent navigation property is not updated.p  pI was thinking perhaps I could then just search the context for the child I just created  based on the returned PK and get a fully populated child object but it doesnt work. It seems I just get back an identical object. I think its just searching the local cache and returning the object I already have. I noticed that context.Child.Local seems to be a way to look at just the local view but I didnt see a store counterpart. p

The counter then gets updated every second with the new value of the cached count. This seems like it might work a lot better, but I dont know specifically how to implement this in Rails.p  pIm using Rails 3.1 and jQuery on Heroku, but Im mostly just looking for a highlevel way to do this. Of course, the more details you can provide the better p

Negative 5769 pWhen testing my application at WXGA720 resolution on the Android Emulator running 4.0.3 Ice Cream Sandwich, my app takes the layout assets from the layoutnormalland854x480 folder in landscape view and the layoutport480x320 folder for portrait view.

Negative 5769 pI have a map which at the moment I place a custom pin on the map every so often from the GPS position of the user, this is also dependent on when their position changes but with the GPS being a bit choppy here it does it quite a lot.

I want to remove the previous pin so that just the one pin for the users location is shown on the map, like a live representation of the users position.p  pIn addition to this. Is it possible to have a separate set of pins on the map which their positions never change and ensure they are not also cleared when the users position is updated.p  pAny other comments on the code would be appreciated.p  precodeImports...  public class MapOne extends MapActivity implements LocationListener   ... fields   Override protected void onCreateBundle icicle      ....onCreate initialisations   Override protected void onPause       TODO Autogenerated method stub     compass.disableCompass     lm.removeUpdatesthis     super.onPause    Override protected void onResume       TODO Autogenerated method stub     compass.enableCompass     lm.requestLocationUpdatesLocationManager.GPSPROVIDER, 1000, 20, this     super.onResume   Override protected boolean isRouteDisplayed      return false   public void onLocationChangedLocation l       TODO Autogenerated method stub             lat  intl.getLatitude 1E6             longi  intl.getLongitude 1E6               GeoPoint ourLocation  new GeoPointlat, longi             OverlayItem overlayItem  new OverlayItemourLocation, Hey, Whats up             CustomPinpoint custom  new CustomPinpointcustomMarker, Map.this             custom.insertPinpointoverlayItem             overlayList.addcustom     codepre  pPinpoint class for reference if required.p  precodepublic class Pinpoint extends ItemizedOverlayltOverlayItemgt   private ArrayListltOverlayItemgt pinpoints  new ArrayListltOverlayItemgt private Context c  public CustomPinpointDrawable defaultMarker      superboundCenterdefaultMarker      TODO Autogenerated constructor stub   public CustomPinpointDrawable m, Context context       TODO Autogenerated constructor stub     thism     setCcontext   Override protected OverlayItem createItemint i       TODO Autogenerated method stub     return pinpoints.geti   Override public int size       TODO Autogenerated method stub     return pinpoints.size   public void insertPinpointOverlayItem item      pinpoints.additem     this.populate   public Context getC      return c   public void setCContext c      this.c  c    codepre

Negative 5769 pAfter changing the data structure from a hrefhttphackage.haskell.orgpackagediffarray relnofollowdiffarraya to a hrefhttphackage.haskell.orgpackagevector0.9.1 relnofollowvectora the memory blows up grows infinitely during one of the QuickCheck tests. The code is hosted at a hrefhttpsgithub.comEdgarGomesDeUni relnofollowGitHuba. The dev branch contains the ill code and the master one runs well. Apart from minor changes the only commit which could have any effect on that is this a hrefhttpsgithub.comEdgarGomesDeUnicommit651ca40043213989394af0910a2c1f8ef90480a0 relnofollowonea. In order to run the QuickCheck routines one should run the executable emtesterem. It seems that small length vectors dont crash the program, but when it gets longer the program slows down and finally blows the memory up. Another thing that intrigues me is the fact that Im having a similar problem in an other of my libraries while rendering XML files. For small files lt400k it runs slow but with no crash and for larger files the memory blows up. The Data.Vector is also involved in that library. I have the intuition these problems are related.p  pstrongEditstrong Ive finally isolated the part of my code that reproduce the memory leak and put it into a single file which can be found a hrefhttphpaste.org65687 relnofollowherea.

I have solved it with a brute force and a little efficient  approachbut not the best one. So, I am looking for an approach which could be the best in solving this kind of problem. Everything is in terms of integerno floating points. p  pMy approach to this is that I first find all the divisors of the number Nwithout any overhead.Then, I sort the list and the divisors in reverse orderseparately. Now, for each divisor D,  I check if it divides any number in the liststarting from the highest element upto an element which is  the divisor D. If it divides, then all divisors of D must also divide. Then I remove those elements from the list of divisors which are also the divisors of Dcan be thought of as removing the intersection. So, ultimately the left array of divisors is the required arrayaccording to my approach. If someone can point any fault or any lack of efficiency in my approach, it is appreciated.

Negative 5769 pLets say I have couple of filters in my deployment descriptor and each request to the app has to pass through those. There is form with a formbean attached to it. Once I fill the form and click submit, when does the html parameters in the form are binded to the form bean Before the request is passed through the filters or after passing thorugh the filtersp  pThe reason I am asking is.. I have a form with 20 fields. Once I click submit, 17 values are being binded to the bean properly but 3 values are missing by the team request reaches validate method. I am absolutely clueless has to where the values are missing. I tried to print an enumeration of all the request parameters in validate method and those three fields are there in request object. AFAIK, There is no issue with those three elements name because the app works perfecly in my local IDE but brakes up in test env which makes it all the more difficult to pinpoint the issue . p

Negative 5769 pIm assisting someone with user interface code to visualise a mathematical image analysis.  During this process well be segmenting part of a 2D shape into triangles, and filling some of these triangles in on the UI.p  pWere looking for a fill algorithm which guarantees that if two triangles share an edge specifically, if any two vertices of the triangles are identical, then regardless of drawing order and aliasing there will be not be blank, undrawn pixels on the line between the two.  Its alright if some pixels are drawn twice.  The result should look OK under arbitrary scaling.  Some triangles may be extremely thin slivers in places, down to 1 pixel wide.p  pIdeally it should also be a reasonably efficient fill algorithmp  pAntialiasing will not be used in triangle rendering, as the final image needs to be 1bit depth.p  pThe context is an imagerecognition application, so all vertex coordinates will be accurate to one pixel.p

Negative 5769 pI have both dreamweaver CS5.5 and Visual Studio Ultimate 2010. Both programs I love, but I really want a way to complete all of my front end coding in Dreamweaver, and then work with the database in VS.Net. p  pI have been completing this by making all of the pages in VS.Net, and then clicking open with Dreamweaver afterwards. Although each time I open the .master file with Dreamweaver it collapses into blank coding, propbably because it doesnt recognise it. I have researched this before,and tried to solve the problem by adding content to the documentType folder but nothing has happened. I really need some support in Dreamweaver because I am alsways changing the design of my pages, and each page uses a materpage file. p  pThe other problem is the masterpage uses .swf files and javascript alot, which is a pain to use in VS.Net, as the code hinting doesnt work properly. p  pDoes anyone have a solution to this problem p

Negative 5769 pIm analyzing the growth pattern of certain particles, and want to compare the point pattern with that of a perfectly hexagonal lattice with the same intensity same number of points per unit of area.  Ive written a function that does this, but it has an inherent error and Im not sure from where it originates.  Essentially, after the function has run its course, it produces a perfectly hexagonal point pattern that does NOT have the correct number of particles  it is usually off by about 14.  If you copy and paste the following code into R, youll see this  for this particular example, the error is 11.25  the original point pattern has 71 particles and the perfectly hexagonal point pattern that was generated has 80 particles.  This seems very odd, since the code, as you will see, is designed to place the particles a specific distance from one another, thereby creating a window of the same size as the original with the same number of particles.  p  pThe following is the code for the function I wrote to generate the hexagonal lattice.p  precodelibraryspatstat  dataswedishpines  swedishpines.df lt as.data.frameswedishpines  MaxXValue lt maxswedishpines.df[1] MaxYValue lt maxswedishpines.df[2] The above two lines dictate the window size NumberOfParticles lt nrowswedishpines.df[1] Number of entries  number of particles  calculate delta intensity lt NumberOfParticles  MaxXValueMaxYValue Intensity gt particles  unit2     Area   sqrt3  2   delta2     Now  in substituting intensity in for area, it is key to recognize      that there are 3 particles associated with each hexagonal tile.     This is because each particle on the border of the tile is really 13 of a      a particle due to it being associated with 3 different hexagonal tiles.       Since intensity  3 Particles  Area,  delta lt sqrt2intensitysqrt3 This is derived from the equation for the area of a regular hexagon.  codepre  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.com2Zcpc.jpg altDiagram of a unit cell of the hexagonal latticep  precodexcoords and ycoords represent the x and y coordintes of all of the generated points.

Negative 5769 pstrongEdit This part is solvedstrongp  pSo I have a bunch of calculations in a program Im making, and the numbers are getting so long that Im getting overflow errors. Its resulting from things like dividing a 50 digit number by another 50 digit number. I need a way to round specific numbers to a certain amount of significant digits.p  pHeres some more information. First of all, all of the numbers I will be rounding will always be less than 1. The numbers can get as small as to the 1E50. I only care about the first 10 or so significant digits. I just need a way to round it off to around ten sig figs before moving on to the next calculation in order to prevent overflow errors. That, and having a number go out to 50 figures is very useless.p  pI was thinking of maybe looping through the number, digit by digit The program could add 1 to a counter when the number is equal to zero, and then break out of the loop once it hits anything other than zero. Then the next step could truncate the number to that counter plus however many significant digits I want.p  pSo for .000001234567812345678 for example. It would return 5 zeroes. If I wanted ten significant figures, I would do five  ten  15. The program would then only keep the first 15 digits after the decimal, so the number would be truncated to .000001234567812.p  pAnother idea might be using the log. Then the power the new number would be raised to would be the number of zeroes in front of the significant digits.p  pWhat I dont know is, first of all, how to go through a number digit by digit, and checking if each number is a zero. I also dont know how to truncate a number to a certain amount of digits.p  pAny help would be greatly appreciatedp  pstrongEdit This part is not solved.strongp  pI would feel bad making another post so soon, so Im going to ask the question here. If its not answered in 20 minutes or so, maybe Ill make another post.

Negative 5769 pHello fellow programmersp  pThis is a question towards  programmers who have experience with using Visual Studio 2010 for debugging external applications.p  pCurrently, Im developping an addon for a program made by people I work for. In order to make this addon work with the external program, I have to place the .dll file in a certain folder, specified by the external program. I have my build settings configurated so the .dll file is copied automatically. I also copy the .pdb file to enable debugging options.p  pSince this addon is nothing but a class library, I cant debug it like I normally would. I also dont have the source code for the external application. How should I debug this class library properlyp  pThis is what I triedp  pstrong1. Attach to Processstrongbr See a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibraryc6wf8e4z.aspx relnofollowAttach to a Running Processa. This seems to work fine, except it takes a few seconds to set up. Thats a problem, because most of the exceptionsbreakpoints occur at the very first seconds of the start of the external program. It also becomes annoying to manually attach Visual Studio to a process, because I debug this class library a lot, thus taking a lot of time after a while.p  pstrong2. Debugger.Launchstrongbr Currently I use a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibrarysystem.diagnostics.debugger.launch.aspx relnofollowDebugger.Launcha to attach Visual Studio to the external program. This will display a Just In Time prompt, asking me which instance of Visual Studio I would like to use. I find this to be much slower than Attach to Process, but this way I am sure that the debugger is attached before any breakpoints can occur. Placing this between codeif DEBUGcode and codeend ifcode makes sure this popup doesnt show when I create a release build, which helps too.p  pstrong3. Add as Existing Projectstrongbr Ive added the executable of the program as a project to my solution. By doing this I can set this executable as startup project, and pressing F5 will start it. The biggest advantage of this, is that I can now debug the executable as soon at is it is started. See a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibrary0bxe8ytt.aspx relnofollowDebug an Executable Not Part of a Visual Studio Solutiona. With this, Visual Studio breaks at exceptions, but unfortunately it doesnt seem to load the breakpoints. The following information is shown when I try using breakpoints img srchttpi.imgur.com5itdQ.png altbreakpoint The modules window displays Binary was not built with debug information.. Can this be solvedp  pstrong4. Start Actionstrongbr SilentDoc noted that I can also set an external program as start action, using Properties  Debug  Start Action. See a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibrary68c8335t.aspx relnofollowChange the Start Action for Application Debugginga It appears to load the breakpoints correctly this way. However, for some reason this makes the external program freeze for strong5 minutesstrong at the first breakpointexception encountered. After it is done freezing, things seem to work as expected. What could cause this freezep  pstrongEditstrong the freeze was caused by the external program. See accepted answers comments.p  pstrong5. Image File Execution Optionsstrongbr As hmemcpy suggested, I can also use Image File Execution Options for a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibrarya329t4ed.aspx relnofollowLaunching the Debugger Automaticallya. This seems to be the same as Debugger.Launch, since it displays the same Just In Time prompt. However, this Just In Time debugger doesnt debug at all breakpoints and exceptions are ignored. Also, when working with a release build, I cant simply disable the Just In Time prompt.p  pstrongSummarystrongbr Option 1 loads breakpoints, breaks at breakpointsexceptions, but takes too much time.br Option 2 loads breakpoints, breaks at breakpointsexceptions, but is too slow.br Option 3 doesnt load breakpoints, and doesnt break at breakpointsexceptions.br Option 4 loads breakpoints, but freezes for 5 minutes at first breakpointexception.br Option 5 doesnt load breakpoints, and doesnt break at breakpointsexceptions.p  pstrongAdditional informationstrongbr The external program and class library are both written in VB.NET, I am using Visual Studio 2010 Ultimate, and the target framework is .NET Framework 4.0.  p  pOption 1 and 2 work for me, but after a while, all those dialogs and prompts become annoying, and slow me down. Option 3 and 4 seem more suitable for me, so if anyone can tell me how to get them to work, that would be great. Option 5 doesnt seem that interesting either, I dont want to be using regedit.exe all the time. If there are any other options, please let me know.p  pThanks.p

pplease note, I can add the groovy source folders using    the GUIs build path   by editing the .classpath file   run mvn eclipseeclipse from the command line and the groovy source dirs get added to .classpath but not the output directories.p  pHowever, looking at a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions7329356eclipseheliosmavenm2egroovyfailthisa and a hrefhttpmojo.codehaus.orgbuildhelpermavenpluginusage.htmlthisa using buildhelper should solve the problem. I have tried putting the buildhelper reference into the project pom.xml with no change in behavior. I have also tried using the maveneclipse plugin to set the additional source folders as described a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions9179791eclipsemavengroovysrctestgroovydirectorygetsremovedafterupdateprherea and p  pWe have four of these sub projects that use groovy and I would love to not have to add the groovy folders and output folders for main and test for each of them whenever we pull new code from SVN. bIt seems that M2Es import maven project just doesnt work correctly.b Neither does mavenupdateProject for that matter. What am I missing from thisp  pAs a work around, it seems that m2e 1.2 does not overwrite the .classpath and .project files like m2e 1.0 liked to do, so I can always manually configure the .classpath and .project files and put them into source control.p
Negative 5769 pI have two images of same size  and I want to check whether the second is the same as the first one but with some shift.So more formally I have two matrices A,B of same size and I want to check whether a submatrix of B occurs in A. But as this pictures are big400x400 I need an efficient way to do so. Acceptable complexity would be On3.Is there a way that can be done or should I make the images smaller p  pThanks in advance.p

Negative 5769 pAs the title indicates, Im having trouble updating a datagrid in WPF. Basically what Im trying to accomplish is a datagrid, that is connected to a SQL Server database, that updates automatically once a user enters information into a few textboxes and clicks a submit button. Youll notice that I have a command that joins two tables. The data from the QuoteData table will be inserted by a different user at a later time.

Negative 5769 pSo I have to create a makefile that would generate the application described below and make sure each generated file has its own rule.p  pFor the makefile The first tool is flex, which takes a file called codespec.lcode and generates a file called codelex.yy.ccode. Another tool called bison expects a file codecalledspec.ycode and will generate the file codespec.tab.ccode. If bison is called using the directives codevdcode, it will also generate a file called codespec.tab.hcode which is needed when compiling lex.yy.c. The two C files can be compiled into object files and then linked together with the yacc ly and lex ll libraries to generate the compiler codea.outcode. The makefile you describe must generate the following commands if you were starting just with spec.l and spec.yp  precodeflex spec.l bison vd spec.y gcc c lex.yy.c gcc c spec.tab.c gcc spec.tab.o lex.yy.o ly ll codepre  pi am not sure where to start with this problemp  pedit what i have so farp  precodecompiler spec.tab.o lex.yy.o gcc spec.tab.o lex.yy.o ly ll lex.yy.c spec.l flex spec.l spec.tab.c spec.y bison vd spec.y spec.tab.o spec.tab.c gcc c spec.tab.c lex.yy.o lex.yy.c spec.tab.h gcc c lex.yy.c clean rm f .c .o a.out codepre

Negative 5769 pIm trying to build my first enterprise strongASP.NET MVC 4strong web application, and Im having some issues figuring out the correct flow of things.p  pLets say I have a view Clients.cshtml, which has the corresponding ClientsController, base class codeControllercode.p  pI want the Clients view to display a list of all clients in the system.p  pBecause of Separation of Concerns, I believe the correct place to handle such a request would be an codeApiControllercode, not the codeControllercode itself, which I believe should be more or less restricted to UI tasks. So, I add the method codegetClientscode in the codeApiControllercode which will return a JSON object containing all the clients.p  pNow, how do I consume this from my View, or my codeControllercode A way, I believe, would be handling it using javascript when the View is loaded, I call the codeApiControllercode using codejQuerycode and such, and display the results asynchronically.p  pBut I am not sure this is the correct approach, is it I believe it is emoneem approach, but Id like to know alternatives, or better more conventional ways of handling this.p  pThank youp

Negative 5769 pI searched through the answers to various questions, but I think that this one hasnt been discussed yet. There are two winforms applications one has focus and the other is running, but does not have focus. p  pHow can I capture from the not foucused one what is happening in the focused. In particulary I need to capture the coordinates from start and end of drag and drop. p  pThe app in the background has a database and I want the user to work kind of simultaneously with two apps. In one app the user does drag and drop and the other app captures coordinates and based on that searches the database and displays results. The user however still remains with the focus in the first one.p  pAny help with the C code will be much appreciated. Thanks,p

Negative 5769 pI am trying to find out how active are the users of my web page after registration, based on what was the sourcelanding page of their first visit. I would rather not try to track users myself  I am already employing Google Analytics on my web page and I know it uses the utma cookie to tell one user from another. I can see summarized landing pagessources in my Analytics reports but would need to have this data per specific user in the time of their sign up.p  pEssentially, when the user signs up with my web page I would like to retrieve their landing page and source from Google Analytics and store it in my applications database along with users name, password, activity etc. This way I could check later, for example whether users who came from Google were more prone to buying premium service that those who came from Facebook etc.p  pI checked the Google Analytics API reference but it doesnt seem to provide getters for this specific data. Ive been looking in up in Google and in Stack Overflow for a while.p  pThis seems like a pretty useful functionality, which many websites should need. What am I missing Maybe I should seek for a solution that doesnt involve GA Or switch to a different analytics Or track users landing pages with cookies myselfp

I also commented labeling where I think the rest of the code should go for part a and b to calculate the results.p  pCan someone please explain how to do this and what methods should be usedp  pHere is my code I know it is incorrectly formatted, it isnt in JCreator, but I couldnt get it to copy on to here correctlyp  precodepublic class GPAFreeResponse       private String[] grades     A P, BP, BP     private String[] ltrGrades  A , A, B, B , B,                                   C, C , C, D , E      private double[] dGrades    4.0, 3.7, 3.3, 3.0, 2.7, 2.3,                                    2.0, 1.7, 1.3, 1.0, 0.0     private double[] bonusPts   .0488,.0488,.0366,.0366,.0366,                                   .0122,.0122,.0122,.0061,.0061, 0.0     private double dGrade      public GPAFreeResponse              dGrade calculateGradeCP  calculateBonusCP  part a         System.out.printlnPart 9a   dGrade         dGrade  calculateGPA                 part b         System.out.printlnPart b   dGrade           public double calculateGPA                         part b              double dResult  0.0         double dTotalQP  0.0         double dBonusPt  0.0          more code goes here          return dResult           public double calculateGradeString str             part a              double dResult  0.0           more stuff here          return dResult           public double calculateBonusString str             part a              double dResult  0.0           and more stuff here          return dResult           public static void mainString[] args              create an instance of GPA         new GPAExtra           codepre
Negative 5769 pI have completed a Java program that is for videoconferencing. It reads and writes from the micspeaker of a network camera that includes twoway audio. This network camera does not have feedback reduction built in, so I must do it myself.p  pI can manually measure the latency, and use volume adjustment to cut out the mic to eliminate the feedback in that way, but do you have a better ideap  pIdeally, my program would eliminate the feedback, without having to cut out unwanted parts. Suppose I am in a twoway conversation. I dont want to miss what the other side is saying, simply because I am talking at the same moment, especially because there is significant latency.p  pCan you recommend a library, or at least a strategy, for eliminating feedbackp  pAdditionally, I would like any tips you may have on eliminating the fuzz that occurs even if the room is completely quiet. Again, I can use volume detection to mute when the room is silent, but then the fuzz is audible as soon as someone starts talking. Or, do you think I should ask about that separatelyp

Negative 5769 pIn my database, I have, lets say, a HUGE collection of meteo broadcast.p  pI would like to get all the meteobroadcast from a particular city, for example, but return only the LATEST entry of meteo broadcast instead of all of them.

Negative 5769 pI am comparing PHPs crypt versus Pythons crypt. From Reading Pythons manual p  blockquote   pa hrefhttpdocs.python.org2librarycrypt.html relnofollowhttpdocs.python.org2librarycrypt.htmlap      pPlatforms Unixp      pThis module implements an interface to the crypt3 routine, which is   a oneway hash function based upon a modified DES algorithm see the   Unix man page for further details. Possible uses include allowing   Python scripts to accept typed passwords from the user, or attempting   to crack Unix passwords with a dictionary.p      pNotice that the behavior of this module depends on the actual   implementation of the crypt3 routine in the running system.   Therefore, any extensions available on the current implementation will   also be available on this module.p      pcrypt.cryptword, salt word will usually be a users password as   typed at a prompt or in a graphical interface. salt is usually a   random twocharacter string which will be used to perturb the DES   algorithm in one of 4096 ways. The characters in salt must be in the   set [.azAZ09]. Returns the hashed password as a string, which will   be composed of characters from the same alphabet as the salt the   first two characters represent the salt itself.p blockquote  pAnd from reading PHPs Cryptp  blockquote   pa hrefhttpphp.netmanualenfunction.crypt.php relnofollowhttpphp.netmanualenfunction.crypt.phpap      pCRYPTSHA512  SHA512 hash with a sixteen character salt prefixed with 6. If the salt string starts with rounds, the numeric   value of N is used to indicate how many times the hashing loop should   be executed, much like the cost parameter on Blowfish. The default   number of rounds is 5000, there is a minimum of 1000 and a maximum of   999,999,999. Any selection of N outside this range will be truncated   to the nearest limit.p blockquote  pTo be fair, I am not including Pythons third party modules...I wanted to compare PHP crypt to Python crypt both stock. p  pAfter reading these two and comparing.... It looks like PHP Crypt using SHA512 and its maximum of 999,999,999 hashing rounds is far strongsuperior than Pythons Crypt. Is this confirmed Or am I not reading this correctly. p

I have tried to print the name stored in the struct as wellp  precode    printfn creating list with headnode as [s]n,ptrgtname codepre  pbut this also fails.p  pSo the problem appears when Im trying to print the name but since Ive tried really many ways of printing it with strcpy, strncat, strdup I start to suspect that im never actually storing the string in the ptrname. So Im either printing it wrong or storing it wrong.p  pI would really appreciate any help or hints towards a solution on this problem Thanks in advance.p

Negative 5769 pI am using jQuery UI to create a dialog that displays when a user clicks on a mailto link. In short, the dialog confirms the user accepts the terms before proceeding.

Ideally, Id like the dialog to fill up most of the screen and always be centered even if the user is zoomed in i.e., I dont want the dialog to ever be cut off when displayed. Alternatively, Id like the dialog to behave as a native dialog box on the iPhone. If I do the latter, will it be necessary to create a separate script that will only run when viewed on a smart phone  p  pAny thoughts on the best way to accomplish either of these goals would be much appreciated.p

Negative 5769 pIm not sure which of these is the best practice, but it seems like a pretty common situation. I have a bunch of classes, so heres a simplified situation I have a class called codeRecordercode that records audio. It contains a bunch of settings for what volume to record at, what file to record at, etc. p  pI want to save it with core data. p  p1 Should I MAKE IT a Managed Object Or should I write a separate Managed Object and add a method like codegetManagedObjectcode and codeinitWithManagedObjectcode to codeRecordercode in order to translate back and forth.p  p2 Or should I make codeRecordercode a managed object.p  pKeep in mind that I subclass codeRecordercode into codeAudioRecordercode, so the core data model has to mirror that hierarchy. p

Negative 5769 pedit Should I have posted this on serverfault instead There is not even a dfsr category on stackoverflow, but I thought this was more of a scriptingprogramming question. Let me know if I should put this on serverfault instead. p  pI attempted to use the DfsrIdRecordInfo class to retrieve all files of a somewhat large 6000 file DFSR database and was getting WMI quota errors. p  pDoubling and even tripling the wmi quotas on the server did not solve this.p  pI found looking here that the index property of this class is The runtime index of the record. This value is used to partition the result of a large query. which sounded like exactly what I wanted, but the behavior of this property is not what I expected. p  pI found that when I try to do paging with this property it does not retrieve all of the records as per the following example with powershell. p  pI tested this on a DFSR database with less than 700 files that does not throw a quota error. Because this is a small database I can get all the files like this in less than a secondp  precodeDFSRFiles       gwmi      Namespace rootmicrosoftdfs      ComputerName dfsrserver      Query SELECT              FROM DfsrIdRecordInfo                              WHERE replicatedfolderguid  guid   PS Fgt DFSRFiles.count 680 codepre  pSo I have 680 files in this DFSR DB.

All the records are unique, but it just doesnt return all of them. p  pIs the index property totally useless for my purpose Perhaps when it says ...partition the result of a large query this means it is to be used on records that have already been returned from WMI not the WMI query itself.p  pAny guidance would be appreciated. Thanks in advance.p

Negative 5769 pI have an application that I have just added ClickOnce to as an update method. Im about to pull it and do something else, even after working through all the gotchas of dealing with ClickOnce in a moderately complex application. Well, its not even a complex application, but its going onto dedicated hardware, so I have a few odd requirements, like completely transparent and automatic updates, no odd little pupup windows, etc. The main one is that the application starts and takes over the system at boot.p  pWhere this causes trouble for ClickOnce is that when the system first boots, there is no network  the WiFi is still getting started and connecting. The application handles this, checking for the network to get started and then connecting to our server. ClickOnce is a different matter. If there is no network when the application starts, then all the ApplicationDeployment functions will not work, even after the network is started.p  pSo, for example, I use something like this to get the versionp  precode   if ApplicationDeployment.IsNetworkDeployed        Version  ApplicationDeployment.CurrentDeployment.CurrentVersion.ToString    else        Version  unknown codepre  pIf I run the application at boot that is, before the network is working, this code will return unknown for the rest of the application run, even after the network is up. If I shut down the application and restart it, it shows the deployed version. So technically, the IsNetworkDeployed is returning an incorrect value. The application WAS network deployed its just not on a network NOW. Ill probably post this as a bug over on MSDN.p  pBTW, the application does not actually require a network to run, so at startup, I cant take the path of wait until the network is ready, then restart the application automatically. The hardware can move around, and may be in the middle of nowhere with no available network at all. I still have to deal with that and I dont actually return unknown for that case, I just pull the version from the assembly. And if the problem was just getting a version, I wouldnt care, but this means that there is no way to ever update the application, since it always starts with no network, and it will never get to my code to check for, download, and autoupdate the application.p  pBefore I write off all my ClickOnce work, I was wondering if anyone knew of a way to reinitialize ApplicationDeployment, so that it will figure out that there is a network and enable all that ClickOnce goodness.p

Negative 5769 pMy question is a rather simple one.  Ive read that the recommended method of retrieving the autoincrementid value of a row Ive inserted in mysqli is the codemysqliinsertidcode function.  However, Im not too familiar and had a question  This is all theoretical at this pointp  pFor these purposes hence the mysqli bit this is all going to be from a PHP web application.  Say multiple users are on the application at once and another row is inserted from a different page between the time that I insert my row and the time that I call codemysqliinsertidcodep  pWould that return an incorrect value, or does MySQL have some sort of feature to prevent such a thing  Or am I simply overestimating the possibility of such a scenariop  pThanks for your time.p

Negative 5769 pQuick question... I have to work with quite a bit of legacy ASP code that I am cleaning up, and it all uses queries that are vulnerable to SQL injection. I have a library that I put together to replace them with parameterized queries, and Im wondering if there is a difference from a security standpoint between the following approaches.p  pApproach 1 This is the approach shown on most examples where parameter objects are individually built and added to the Command object. a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions7734673mysqlclassicaspparameterizedqueries77367417736741Heres an example from another questiona.p  pApproach 2 Use the Command.Execute method with an array of parameter values. Examplep  precodeCommand.CommandText  select foo, bar from baz where a   and b   Command.Execute , Array1, BBB codepre  pYes, the first parameter to Execute is ignored.p  pThe first approach has each parameter built with its type, size, etc all specified, and it needs to match the database. But Ive always had trouble with that approach, weird errors and the like if everything isnt just perfect. So I prefer the latter, and it in fact works with my coding style emmuchem better because I can encapsulate the DB logic into a class and pass around arrays as needed without having to litter my code with tons of DB calls.p  pExample of approach 2 using my wrapper DB.Query methodp  precodeset rs  DB.Queryselect foo, bar from baz where a   and b  , Array1, BBB codepre  pOrp  precodeset rs  DB.Queryselect foo, bar from baz, empty codepre  ppassing keyword ememptyem to denote the parameter is not usedp  pGiven that, Im wondering strongIs approach 2 still safe from SQL injection attacksstrongp  pThanks.p  pstrongEditstrong The call to Execute was wrong and written from memory, it has been corrected.p

But this seems ugly to me and also raises the issue of cleanup not being properly dealt with if an unhandled exception is thrown somewhere.

Negative 5769 pI am currently working on a installed desktop application implemented in java. I intend to integrate Google Calendar API into the application. p  pDuring the authorization procedure, I come to this stage where I am able to get the authorization code only through triggering a browser where the user consent page is displayed. Users then have to click accept and will be redirected to a webpage where the authorization code is presented. Users are to copy this code to the Eclipse System.in in order for the authorization process to continue to exchange the authorization code for a TokenResponse. p  pMy question is that how can I simplify this process so that the user wont have to do this stupid copyandpaste stuff for the authorization code to be received This wont work anyway, if the project is compiled into a jar file... Currently all I know is that I will need to provide a callbackurl or something, I just cant figure this out. Therefore, I would appreciate a more concrete answer, rather than simply tell me the concepts.p  pThanks in advance.p
Negative 5769 pI generate some graphics using luacairo and would like to show them in a .dot net c program windows forms not WPF. I generate some scientific graphs. Cairo can generate a variety of graphics formats and I am not sure which is the best choice for this task.

I only want to display the graphics and allow the user to zoom in and out but not change the graphics itself. Can you suggest the optimal graphics format for this taskp  pP.S. I found a hrefhttpsgithub.comvvvvSVG relnofollowhttpsgithub.comvvvvSVGa for drawing SVGs but it seems to be quite complex. If you think that is still the best solution Is there a simple example making use of this libraryp

Negative 5769 pI have the following puzzle works in NodeJSp  precodeconsole.log42.toFixed console.logObject.getPrototypeOf42 codepre  pWhile the first line does show code[Function toFixed]code, the second fails with codeTypeError Object.getPrototypeOf called on nonobjectcode. This, I believe, is the correct behavior as for the spec but puzzling for anyone how believes that emeverything is an object in JavaScriptem. p  pNow I would like to write a method like codeconsole.dircode that outputs all the properties of an object, including those coming from prototypes, and including those that are in fact accessible from primitive values. p  pOf course, the crux of the matter is that JavaScript tries to be smart and does a behindthescenes sleightofhand, casting the primitive value code42code to something akin to codenew Number 42 code. The trick is done when you access a certain named property on the primitive value, but not when the value is an argument to codegetPrototypeOfcode I believe it really should. p  pIn order to reach my goal, I could go and determine the type of the primitive value in case codegetPrototypeOfcode should fail, and then pick from a hopefully limited number of possibilities codeNumbercode, codeStringcode, codeBooleancode, ... the right one. this does not even sound difficult. p  pBut it does feel a little ... wrong. What feels much better is a builtin  custom method codecastasobjectcode that converts a primitive to an object no matter what its type is, preferably in some generic and futureproof way. Is that possiblep  pn.b. Its trivial to go from type name to prototype when type names are unique and the set of primitives is small and closedbut Im asking this question with the hope that answers will help people to better understand that theoretically simple yet practically intricate beast that is JavaScripts object model. p

Negative 5769 pIve been working on Ruby wrapper for some thridparty product DB API.p  pThe API is RESTish and has models like Product, Category, Company, Event, etc, with API endpoints like codeapiProduct.getInfocode.p  pMy approach is to create the corresponding Ruby classes to these API models with API call wrappers and convenient methods. All of such model classes share the same parent class, Base, which abstracts API calls and has other common features.p  pThere is a lot of similarities among theese API models. For instance, Product, Company, and Event models can be tagged and hence have a set of API calls for tagging, such as codecreateTagcode, codedeleteTagcode, codegetTagscode, and, to abstract the tagging feature, I have created codeTaggablecode module and have it included in these three models.p  pNow, the problem is, there is this review feature with two primary API calls  codecreateReviewcode and codegetReviewscode, shared among Product, Event, Company, and some other models omitted for simplicity however, only Product and Event models support both codecreateRiviewcode and codegetReviewscode, and the rest only support codegetReviewscode.p  pThen I thought itd be nice to have two modules  codeReviewablecode and codeWithReviewscode where the former readwrite inherits the latter readonly, but apparently, Ruby does not support submoduling.p  pWhat should I do nowp  ol liShould I make a writeonly version instead of readwrite version i.e. codeReviewablecode and include both modules in Product and Event models  li liIs there any Ruby way to somehow inherit codeWithReviewscode readonly to create codeReviewablecode readwrite  li liOr am I totally off and there is a better way to tackle this kind of problem  li ol  pAlso, what do you think of my module namingp  pLike,p  ul liTaggable  both read and write tags on a modelli liReviewable  same as above for reviewsli liWithReviews  READONLY review featuresli ul  pI think the first two ables sound fine, but is there a better way or convention of naming the readonly version Do you have any recommendation for WRITEONLY module naming in case I have to create onep  pThank youp  pSAKI Dp

Negative 5769 pI am planning to write a Library Information System in C.p  pI need to create the business logic in C. I will create the application as an engine which gets the input process the data dumps the output. I have to give the flexibility to for the user to create GUI in any programming language say C, Python, Java or as a Webform inn PHP,JSP or ASP.

The console application will process it and send the data to GUI application for display.p  pWhich is the best way to transfer the data between console application and GUI One option in my mind is GUI will read the data from form and save it to a JSON file and invoke console application and pass JSON fle to it. The console application will process it and save the output as another JSON file, the GUI program will parse it and display it.p  pIs there any other better option Should I use any data transfer protocol to transfer data If so which one should I use p

Negative 5769 pI cant seem to get around the reason why A outperforms IDA most of the time. My proffessor has said that the reason is not because of the fact that the earlycloser to root nodes keep been reexplored as IDA backtracks after reaching the flimit but rather because because A maintains an open and closed list so that a given state isnt explored multiple times through the tree whereas in IDA if there are multiple paths to a given node in the tree, it will explore those nodes again and again. My question is it the same with IDA ie. isnt it possible to implement IDA with an open and closed list and if not why p

What I want to do is to slap down a network enabled DVR and consume its video channelsstream over a network without having to custom develop specifically for that DVR via their manufacturer SDK.p  pTo achieve this I understand that each DVR system would need to implement a protocol standard which i suspect they do not.

Which codeAttributecode class would I derive from  Authorize doesnt really seem to fit and I would associate this with user authentication.

Negative 5769 pId like to know if its possible to somehow figure out if, by mistake, inside a UVM driver the developer writes to a DUT output signal, instead of an input signal. Ive tried this out and there is no compileruntime error message. The example is here try outs were done in Incisive on my machine and the code later uploadedp  pa hrefhttpwww.edaplayground.comx386httpwww.edaplayground.comx386ap  pThe assign on somesignal models a DUT output a continuous driver. I would have expected a runtime error whenever I try to drive somesignal from the class saying that the signal is multiply driven, but the class driver wins and updates the signal.p  pSome time ago, when I had just started doing SV I played around with modports. I would declare some signals as inputs in the modport, but I noticed that it was still legal to drive them. I quit using them afterwards. Apparently this is something well known, as this post says a hrefhttpsverificationacademy.comforumssystemverilogmodportssvhttpsverificationacademy.comforumssystemverilogmodportssvap  pI recently inherited some code from a colleague that makes use of modports in classes. I made the following example to illustrate what that code is doingp  pa hrefhttpwww.edaplayground.comx2Whttpwww.edaplayground.comx2Wap  pI try to use modports in the two classes, but ModelSim complains that one should not use modports in hierarchical paths. Incisive had no problem with the code and issued no warnings. The ModelSim errors, together with this quote from the 2012 standard To restrict interface access within a bmoduleb, there are modport lists with directions declared within the interface. kind of suggest that modports arent really intended to be used in classes.p  pCan someone confirm that modports arent the way to go here Also, does anyone know if such errors driving DUT outputs from classes could be caught in any wayp

Negative 5769 pIm trying to create a single webpage that replaces the content of the main div when navigation links are clicked. Ive been able to implement the pushstate function to replace the div content and change the url address pretty easily.  I also am able to get the content to refresh when the backforward buttons are clicked with the popstate function.  However, now I click the first link and it works fine, I click the next link and it seems to apply 2 pushstates, the 3rd click, applies 3 pushstates, etc.  It seems there is a push loop occurring somewhere but not sure where it is.  I am in search of some advice on how to eliminate the multiple pushstates from occurring so they arent duplicated in my history.p  pHTML codep  precodeltnav idheaderNavgt     ltulgt         ltligtltbutton classnavButton idsignIn href.contentsignIn.php namereply titleSignIngtSign Inltbuttongtltligt         ltligtltbutton classnavButton idsignUp href.contentregistration.php nameregistration titleRegistrationgtSign Upltbuttongtltligt         ltligtltbutton classnavButton idabout href.contentabout.php namesettings titleAboutgtAboutltbuttongtltligt     ltulgt    ltnavgt      ltsection idmainContentgt     lt CONTENT PAGES REPLACE HERE gt     ltphp         include .contentstart.php     gt  ltsectiongt codepre  pJavascriptp  precodedocument.readyfunction       if window.history ampamp history.pushState           .navButton.clickfunctione                  e.preventDefault             mainContent.fadeOut.loadthis.attrhref.fadeIn             history.pushStatenull, this.attrtitle, this.attrname                  window.addEventListenerpopstate, function      WHEN BACKFORWARD CLICKED CHECKS URL PATHNAME TO DETERMINE WHICH CONTENT TO PLACE IN DIV     if location.pathname  index.php          mainContent.load.contentstart.php      else          mainContent.load.content  location.pathname  .php       codepre
Negative 5769 pI am beginner in java and would like to clear an idea about variable initialization. Here is the code p  precodepublic class NumberSequence    private static int n   public static void mainString[] args      printmyTest     printmyTest       private static int myTest      n     return n  n     codepre  pwith two successive calls of the method myTest the outputs are 1 and 4. So I understand that the default value of n is 0. So for the first call of myTest, n would be incremented by one resulting 1 and then the multiply line will be executed, that is, code1  1code which is code1code.p  pFor the next call of myTest, n will be initially 1, then it will be incremented to 2, then the multiplication, that is code2  2code which is code4code p  pNow I am trying to do this p  precodepublic class NumberSequence    public static void mainString[] args      int m     m      int n  m  m     printn    n     codepre  pHere it gives complier error that m is not initialized which is obvious. So my question is  how come compiler doesnt complain in case of the first option where I created myTest method. There I do not initialize the value of codencode. Is it the case that compiler is doing the initialization I would like to get this clarification.p

Negative 5769 pMy mainview contains a PartialView and a function called codeFinishedSelectInMaincode,and the PartialView is a ztree which has check event and click event and used in many pages.Now  when I click the  ztree in PartialView,How can I call the  codeFinishedSelectInMaincode funcion after the click function in PartialView I know in the PartialView it will execute click function automatically when I click the ztree. I know that put the codeFinishedSelectInMaincode function after click funcion in the PartialView will be OK,But it will destroy the integrity of the PartialView.Because the codeFinishedSelectInMaincode function is only for the mainpage,but the PartialView is not only used in the mainpage,it is also used in page1,page2.p

Ive experimented with every combination of nginxs settings codegzip oncode and codememcachedgzipflag 1code but in all cases the browser displays raw data after the first direct python hit in some cases firebug reports that contentencoding is gzip but is still showing raw gzip data and in others, contentencoding is not set.p  pOverall, my plan of attack is to trick nginx into serving alreadycompressed data with the right headers so that browsers will unzip it.p  pIm in nginx 1.6 amp memcached 1.4.13p  pHeres the related nginx config lines, which originally would work.

Negative 5769 pI am writing a 2048 game and selfsolver in Java. My most important class is a codeBoardcode, which contains the main game functionality. For efficiency reasons, many aspects of the game are encoded in arrays, such as the transformations for each possible row when moved left or right. In a codestaticcode initialization block, I call codestatic void generateTablescode, which creates the tables once.p  pBoards with solving capabilities codeextendcode codeBoardcode and codeimplementcode codeSolvercode, an interface containing highlevel methods codegetDirectioncode and codegetWorstLocationcode which are used by the interface classes to run the solver and to get hints. The main type of solver I am interested in records a list of heuristic values for all possible rows, then runs expectiminimax search using these values. So I have the classp  precodepublic class HeuristicBoard extends Board implements Solver       private static int[] heuristic  Lookup table       ... methods omitted ...       private int heuristic ...      Calculates a heuristic value for the entire board based      on calls to the following method      This methods code could change depending on algorithm implementation.     private static int heuristicshort row ...      Checks the lookup table for the row provided     private static void generateHeuristicTable ...      Generates the lookup table based on calls to the following method     private static int heuristicbyte[] row ...      Calculates the heuristic value for a single row.      This methods code could change depending on algorithm implementation.  codepre  pNow, I would like to test multiple different heuristics, but with the same expectiminimax algorithm. Therefore, the implementations of codeint heuristiccode and codestatic int heuristicbyte[] rowcode would change, while the others would remain the same. What is the best way to abstract the functionality of the codeHeuristicBoardcode class so as to have multiple child classes that implement codeint heuristiccode and codestatic int heuristicbyte[] rowcode Preferably they would have a common ancestor so I could havep  precodeClassOrInterface firstSolver  new EmptySpaceHeuristicBoard ClassOrInterface secondSolver  new MonotonicityHeuristicBoard codepre  pWhat I have thought of and have seen suggested on various StackOverflow answersp  ol lipMake codeHeuristicBoardcode codeabstractcode and make the two methods codeabstractcode. But for some reason yes, I have read why you cant have a codestatic abstractcode method. If I make codestatic int heuristicbyte[] rowcode nonstatic, I would have no way to use it in the codestatic void generateHeuristicTablecode method, which should be implemented in the codeHeuristicBoardcode class, not in a subclass I would have to reimplement it in each subclass, changing only the throwaway codenew SubclassOfHeuristicBoard.heuristiccurrentRowcode every time. If I make this method nonstatic too, ignoring the inconvenience demonstrated above, then I would not be able to call codegenerateHeuristicTablecode in a codestaticcode initialization block, thus making it so that the large table would be generated with every new instance of the class.pli lipMake a codeHeuristicSolvercode interface which includes the static method, then have codeHeuristicBoardcode codeimplementcode codeHeuristicSolvercode, then subclass codeHeuristicBoardcode. However, this forces me to provide a default implementation of the static method, which I dont think makes sense. Only the subclasses ought to be instantiated, because only they ought to provide a heuristic implementation. Furthermore, the other static methods in the class reference static variables only found in the codeBoardcode class.pli lipThere are other possibilities, but they really just get worse after making codeHeuristicBoardcode nonabstract.pli ol  pIt seems to me that the only proper way to do this is to make codeHeuristicBoardcode codeabstractcode, but I cant figure out what to do with the codestaticcode method.p  pEDIT It has been pointed out that both methods can be changed to be codenonstaticcode. This solves the above problems, but now I have another problem in the nonstatic AI method, I duplicate the board for recursive purposes codeHeuristicBoard option  new HeuristicBoardboardcode. If the class is abstract, however, I cant do this. How should I create an instance of whichever the current class is i.e. in the codeEmptySpaceHeuristicBoardcode class, when this method is inherited and executed, it should create a codenew EmptySpaceHeuristicBoardcode.p

For special characters it throws ConverterException and wont parse the file.p  pI want to know if there is any other parser which can be used to parse Invalid XML files special characters etc We have no control over what would be sent as Input stream and as a part of auditing application, need to read as much Good records from the incoming file as possible.p  pIs there a better parsing option available or do I need to write Custom Parser to parse these files I am using Spring Batch to do batch processing and XStream1.x to parse the XML files.p  pAS XSD validation is failing, I am wondering even if its worth to explore other parsers Custom parser option..p  pLooking for your expert opinions on XML Validations..p

Negative 5769 pI am programming a game on XCodes SpriteKit. I have a variable NodeGamePlay an SKNode and I set it to NodeGamePlay.pausedtrue when I hit a pause button. I have tracked this through various NSLog statements scattered throughout my code and when I set NodeGamePlay.pausedtrue, the game actually pauses, but it seems to somewhat arbitrarily unpause itself I dont even have a NodeGamePlay.pausedfalse anywhere in the code. p  pAnyways, I have not had any success tracking down when this is getting changed incorrectly to pausedfalse. I tried using the watch variable feature, to watch the variable NodeGamePlay, but the debug wont stopalert me that NodeGamePlay switches between true amp false. I was wondering if there is some method of tracking THIS property and having the debug stop as soon as the value is changedp

Negative 5769 pLets say Ive create a annotation called codeEnableFeauturecode which imports a bean configuration class codeEnableFeatureConfigurationcode. This annotation is typically placed on top of the dispatcher configuration. Must beans like view resolvers etc. belong to that dispatcher config but a few beans really belong to the root context. p  pHow can I define those beans without the need for another annotation My first thought was to autowire the codeWebApplicationContextcode and call codecontext.getParentBeanFactorycode to register beans but Im not sure if this is the best way to achieve my goal. How is this typically donep  hr  h3UPDATEh3  pTo clarify the problem a bit. Im working on a project to integrate a template engine with Spring MVC. The project consists of the following categories  partsp  ul liConfigurationli liAnnotation e.g. codeEnableFeaturecode imports configurationli liViewli liViewResolverli liTemplate factoryli ul  pLogically all class categories could exist in the web application context. However, the template factory could be used by other services as well email, etc.. Services that mostly exist in the root context. So what Im basically asking is, how can I make the factory available to the root context in a clean way. I would like the configuration required to be as low as possible. As of now the setup only requires one annotation placed on top of the dispatcher configuration class.p

Negative 5769 pThe following code checks if the selected tag has childnodes. If a child node is present , it loops till a child node is found.

Negative 5769 pWhat is the easiest way of setting up a gradle configuration so that I can run tests for only one or two submodules in a multimodule project p  pThe reason I dont need to test all of them is because they reside in their own repositories and get tested when those are changed. It really increases the turnaroundtime to have TeamCity run a shitload of tests that I know will pass. p  pMy initial thought was to set up a task in the toplevel build.gradle that has dummy implementations in the modules that dont need to run the tests and performs connectedCheck for the android submodule and runs the tests for the java ones, but I havnt gotten that to work yet.

I had to remove the text and other aspects from the screenshot due to security concerns, my apologies.  I replaced most of them generic text to still provide context.

It usually displayed along side other screens on a very long, very large video wall.p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comKRTNT.png altscreenshotp  pThe Alarm with the words Binding Limits the first word was removed, Text doesnt normally sit over like that has a reasonable animated rolling gradient that replaced a simple flashing.  Additionally the alarm status in the case causes the shape spin.  p  pThe feedback was that when an alarm status changes for the first time from green to yellow or orange to red etc that they would like some additional indication.  I had a few different ideas.  My first was to try animating the text to cause it to expand a little almost pulsing.  When I tried however it expands very obviously to the right and down only and didnt really give that Swelling effect I had hoped for.p  pAnother idea for which I asked here was to possibly animate a glowing border around the alarm item.  Something that would get Bright and then Dim 3 or 4 times when the status changed.  I am open to other ideas however.  I really like the animation abilities in WPF but I am finding difficulty in using it to articulate my ideas.

This is a very simple game, so I am using boxes with pictures on them for the monsters.

Is there a way I can modify the current box to change how it deals with textures, or is there another solution Thanksp  pEDITp  pExample Codep  precode Adds new box to list of models using createBox method of ModelBuilder models.addmodelBuilder.createBox3f, 3f, 6f, minM, Usage.Position  Usage.Normal  Usage.TextureCoordinates   Increments count to keep track of model count   Adds instance of model to list of instances to be rendered later using ModelBatch instances.addnew ModelInstancemodels.getcount, m.getEnd.getX  spacing, m.getEnd.getY  spacing, z codepre  pProblemp  pWhen rendered the front of the box looks like a hrefhttpimgur.comu0iMisv relnofollowthisa, but the right side looks like a hrefhttpimgur.comhUyW2V9 relnofollowthisa.

Negative 5769 pThe following is my code and the final test case. main and printStats are both given, I had to qrite average which is at the bottom, so look there for problems. This case changes the value of all registers in f, t, a, and s and adds 2 items to the top of its stack in order to ensure that the average method is preserving properly the values it will need to run its calculations following the jr from printStats. p  pThe problem I am having is recurring in a few test cases where there are 3 batters. Batter 3 uses arbitrarily large integers.p  precode printStats puts two values at the top two spots in its stack.  This is where     the number of homeruns and outs were placed when printStats     is called.  A function is allowed to change its own stack.   Changes the s registers used by main. The average function should be     getting arguments from the a registers and the stack, and not relying     on what is in the s registers.   From test12  Tests if t registers are preserved if needed by average.  printStats puts values into every t register.   From test13  Tests if a registers used correctly when average calls printStats.  printStats changes the contents of a1, a2, and a3 before returning   test with three batters, both average and slugging percentage  First batter has no hits, but does have outs  Second batter has hits and outs, with realistic values  Third hitter has large values for some of the hits and for the     outs. This means the hits and outs have to be converted from ints     to floats in order to get the right answer.   .data  mainNumBatters    .word 3  mainBatter1    .word  27       walks    .word   0

Negative 5769 pIve used both Xcode and Visual Studio extensively over the past year, and the one thing I miss about Xcode when using VS is the autocompletion suggestions while typing in the middle of words. Let me explainp  pIn Xcode, autocomplete suggestions the little dropdown that appears as you begin to type work from any point in the word. So lets say you start typing something, click somewhere else, then get back to what you were typing Xcode will happily keep giving you autocomplete suggestions. If you do this in VS, youll find that autocomplete suggestions dont appear. You have to delete what you typed and start over again. If you were typing a method, you have to erase up to and including the dot, retype the dot, and only then do you get the suggestions. This is very annoying when going from Xcode to VS. Is there any way to enable Xcode style autocomplete suggestions in VS Ive googled but all Ive come up with are plugins like Visual Assist X, which are not free and have a bunch of other features Im not sure I absolutely need. Id like something that would solve this specific issue, preferably free.p

The clean way to do it would bep  precodesortargnN, List, Sorted      maplisttopairsargN, List, Pairs,     keysortPairs, Sortedpairs,     pairsvaluesSortedpairs, Sorted. codepre  pIf we wanted to use codepredsort3code to achieve the same effect, we could try using a comparison predicate as followsp  precodecompareargnN, Delta, A, B      argN, A, AN,     argN, B, BN,     compareDelta, ANA, BNB. codepre  pAnd to sort on the second argumentp  precode predsortcompareargn2, List, Sorted. codepre  pHowever, this is emnot the sameem as codesortargn3code above that uses codekeysort2code.

If the codeviewModelcode is retrieving data from Network with asynchronous tasks and I want to display an spinner and get data for fulfil the view.

Negative 5769 pIm trying to use Hibernate Search on two Entities, that do not and must not share a relation on objectlevel, however theyre connected by a join table that uses their IDs. legacyp  pThese are more or less the two Entitiesp  precodeEntity Indexed class Person      Id     private long id      Field     private String name     ....

This means Im searching for attributes from both Person and Address. p  pI guess the easiest way is to emulate an IndexedEmbedded relation which means denormalizing the data and add street and zip from Address to a Person document. I stumbled upon Hibernate Search Programmatic API, but Im not sure if thats the right way to go and how to go on from to there.. Would this be the proper way of doing things or am I missing somethingp

It works, however Im not satisfied with this, because I can only determine current selection by label selected in spinner. Obviously, its not good because country name is not guaranted to be unique its just simple app for education puroposes.p  pThe best solution is to store in my spinner both country name as spinner label visible for user and corresponding record id. Id is autogenerated value and of course its unique, so it can be used to determine selection and read all other propertis from database, using id value, or edit seleted record and save new info to database.p  pI know how to readedit record by id.

Negative 5769 pI am trying to match records from two tables without a common key and with some errors in the data. Specifically I have records in Table A for a given group and date that I want to match with records in Table B with the same group, but the date may differ. Additionally some records may only exist in table A or B.p  pstrongExample tablesstrongp  precodeTable A  id  group    date  ...   0      A  1115  ...  1      B  1315  ...  2      A  1515  ...  3      A  1515  ...                  99      Z  4515  ...  Table B  id  group    date  ...   0      A  1215  ...  1      A  1515  ...  2      A  1615  ...                  99      Z  4515  ... codepre  pHere I would want record 0 in table A to match with record 0 in table B even though the dates are different but are close, record 1 in table A is missing in table B, and there may be multiple records in table A or B with the same group and date these are not duplicates.p  pCurrently I am not matching records where the dates differ, but I am losing potentially useful data. Therefore I would like to iteratively improve the matching so that I have more complete matching. I think that a probabilistic approach would make the most sense rather than a deterministic one, but am open to arguments on this.p  pMy first question is what the right tool for this is. Currently the tables are in a PostgresSQL database and are large enough that it would be difficult to process them on a local machine. However I am not familiar with any way of performing probabilistic joins in Postgres, but I expect that Python has good enough support for probabilistic record linkage.p  pCan should this be done in Postgres or a different tool Python Can anyone direct me to any resources examples, code, etc.p

Negative 5769 pI would like to set up a simple Titan instance with Cassandra in embedded mode for my application.

This seems to work fine as Titan tries to fire up cassandra on startup.p  pThe problem is that codecassandra.yamlcode is referenced throughout the documentation, but I cant find an example of this file that works together with Titan.

Negative 5769 pI recently started programming with JavaFx. I have the following Problem I am writing a controller class, in which I hava a Table with orders, but the content can only be set in the initialize method. p  pThe List with orders should be set in the orderTable with the method strongsetorderListstrong.    The problem is that the Orders are not shown in the TableView.br I have already tried to trigger an update of the TableView by removing the items of the Table and filling them up again.  p  pFor test purposes i created the orderList with a testorder in the initialize method and set them to the table with strongorderTable.setItemsorderListstrong. When i did this it worked perfectly.br So the order from the initialize method with number 23 is shown in the Table but the List thats set in strongsetOrderListstrong is not. This confuses me, because it seems like the strongorderTable.setItemsorderListstrong Statement only works in the initialize method.br Here is my code   p  precodepublic class OrderOverviewController implements Initializable      FXML     private TableViewltOrdergt orderTable      FXML     private TableColumnltOrder,Integergt orderNumberColumn      private ObservableListltOrdergt orderList      private OrderDao orderDao       Override     public void initializeURL location, ResourceBundle resources           orderNumberColumn.setCellValueFactorynew PropertyValueFactoryltgtorderId          orderListFXCollections.observableArrayList                         ordernumber and Current user         orderList.addnew Order23,null         orderTable.setItemsorderList            public void setOrderListObservableListltOrdergt orderList           orderTable.setItemsorderList            codepre  pThis is the start method of the main class where i setup the scenes for my application.

Negative 5769 pI stumbled on a problem after a migration from EF4.1 to EF6.p  pTo simplify I created the example below. The problem is that on the call codectx.SaveChangescode codep.CityIdcode gets populated with the correct value, but not codep.CityId2code.p  pIf after the creation of the City entity I call the codectx.SaveChangescode the codep.CityId2code is set correctly.p  pOn EF4.1 the code below sets the codep.CityId2codecorrectly without the intermediate codectx.SaveChangescode.p  pAny idea why this happens and what I should do in this case except the intermediate codectx.SaveChangescode.

Negative 5769 pI think it may be my misunderstanding on how the google javascript client libraries are loaded, but why would a javascript api call take least precedence when being invoked within the angularJS framework.

Long story short, this messesup the logic with the rest of my code if it is not invoked in the order that I write it. p  pAny hints as to why this is Can I override the gapi invocation for it to execute with first priorityp  pIm still perusing the a hrefhttpsdevelopers.google.comapiclientlibraryjavascriptdevdevjscript relnofollowgoogle client javascript librarya for more clues.

I dont get any errors in the code whatsovever. But when I try and build my project, it wont work.

Negative 5769 pOk, so I was just going for proof of concept here and I did manage to get this working. Discalimer I have been told this is something that should be using threading but Im new to python and that might be out of my grasp currently Its a program that reads a csv file and plots the data, then repeats. I have a program writing the csv and I am able to see the plot being created in real time which is exactly what I wanted. What I dont undestand fully is why its crashing. I understand my code is pretty sloppy but any mouse click anywhere on the screen or even just tabbing to a different screen causes my program to stop responding. Is there an easy fix to thisp  precodeimport csv  import time import matplotlib.pyplot as plt import matplotlib  filename  sample.csv callback   global counter results  counter  0 timestr  [] thickness  [] thick  []   def csvprocessfilename, callback, delay1  class waiter          def initself, fd, delay1         self.fd  fd         self.delay  delay     def iterself         return self     def nextself          while True             line  fd.readline             if line                 return line             time.sleepself.delay             results     def nextself   bc im using Python3.4         return self.next with openfilename, rt as fd     rows  csv.readerwaiterfd, delay, delimiter,     for row in rows         callbackrow     results  def processrowrow  global time, thickness, counter, timestr, thick, results counter  counter1 if counter gt 5    csv file has 5 lines of header data      hrs  floatrow[0][1113]   had a hard time getting the data into a format I could plot     mins  floatrow[0][1416]     secs  floatrow[0][1722]     timestr.appendhrs1440mins60secs     thick  floatrow[3]     thickness.appendthick     return thickness, timestr  fig  plt.figure axes  fig.addsubplot111 line,  axes.plot[], [], . plt.ion  def results     global line     line.setdatatimestr, thickness     plt.show     while 1         plt.draw         axes.relim         axes.autoscaleTrue,both,True          axes.autoscaleviewTrue,True,True         return line  if name  main      csvprocessfilename, processrow codepre  pSample csv datap  precode Comments    Samples Averaged 1  Factor 1  Units um  A,B,C,D,E,F,G,H,I,J 20150814 130952.809000,1,0,1257.57,,,,0,0,1 20150814 130952.824000,1,0,1257.57,,,,0,0,1 20150814 130952.839000,1,0,1257.57,,,,0,0,1 20150814 130952.854000,1,0,1257.57,,,,0,0,1 20150814 130952.869000,1,0,1257.57,,,,0,0,1 20150814 130952.884000,1,0,1257.57,,,,0,0,1 20150814 130952.899000,1,0,1257.57,,,,0,0,1 codepre

It is first processed as a Grunt template, where the lt       pairs are evaluated based on this very configuration object.           meta        banner          n            lt pkg.name gt  vlt pkg.version gt  lt grunt.template.todayyyyymmdd gtn            lt pkg.homepage gtn           n            Copyright c lt grunt.template.todayyyyy gt lt pkg.author gtn            Licensed lt pkg.licenses.type gt ltlt pkg.licenses.url gtgtn           n     ,             Creates a changelog on a new version.           changelog        options          dest CHANGELOG.md,         template changelog.tpl            ,             Increments the version number, etc.           bump        options          files [           package.json,            bower.json         ],         commit false,         commitMessage chorerelease vVERSION,         commitFiles [           package.json,            clientbower.json         ],         createTag false,         tagName vVERSION,         tagMessage Version VERSION,         push false,         pushTo origin            ,                 The directories to delete when grunt clean is executed.           clean [        lt builddir gt,        lt compiledir gt     ],             The copy task just copies files from A to B. We use it here to copy       our project assets images, fonts, etc. and javascripts into       builddir, and then to copy the assets to compiledir.           copy        buildappassets          files [                         src [  ],             dest lt builddir gtassets,             cwd srcassets,             expand true                   ]          ,       buildvendorassets          files [                         src [ lt vendorfiles.assets gt ],             dest lt builddir gtassets,             cwd .,             expand true,             flatten true                   ]          ,       buildappjs          files [                        src [ lt appfiles.js gt ],             dest lt builddir gt,             cwd .,             expand true                    ]       ,       buildvendorjs          files [                        src [ lt vendorfiles.js gt ],             dest lt builddir gt,             cwd .,             expand true                    ]       ,       buildvendorcss          files [                        src [ lt vendorfiles.css gt ],             dest lt builddir gt,             cwd .,             expand true                    ]       ,       compileassets          files [                        src [  ],             dest lt compiledir gtassets,             cwd lt builddir gtassets,             expand true           ,                        src [ lt vendorfiles.css gt ],             dest lt compiledir gt,             cwd .,             expand true                    ]            ,             grunt concat concatenates multiple source files into a single file.           concat                 The buildcss target concatenates compiled CSS and vendor CSS         together.               buildcss          src [           lt vendorfiles.css gt,           lt builddir gtassetslt pkg.name gtlt pkg.version gt.css         ],         dest lt builddir gtassetslt pkg.name gtlt pkg.version gt.css       ,                The compilejs target is the concatenation of our application source         code and all specified vendor source code into a single file.               compilejs          options            banner lt meta.banner gt         ,         src [            lt vendorfiles.js gt,            module.prefix,            lt builddir gtsrc.js,            lt html2js.app.dest gt,            lt html2js.common.dest gt,            module.suffix          ],         dest lt compiledir gtassetslt pkg.name gtlt pkg.version gt.js            ,             grunt coffee compiles the CoffeeScript sources. To work well with the       rest of the build, we have a separate compilation task for sources and       specs so they can go to different places. For example, we need the       sources to live with the rest of the copied JavaScript so we can include       it in the final build, but we dont want to include our specs there.           coffee        source          options            bare true         ,         expand true,         cwd .,         src [ lt appfiles.coffee gt ],         dest lt builddir gt,         ext .js            ,             ngAnnotate annotates the sources before minifying. That is, it allows us       to code without the array syntax.           ngAnnotate        compile          files [                        src [ lt appfiles.js gt ],             cwd lt builddir gt,             dest lt builddir gt,             expand true                    ]            ,             Minify the sources           uglify        compile          options            banner lt meta.banner gt         ,         files            lt concat.compilejs.dest gt lt concat.compilejs.dest gt                     ,             gruntcontribless handles our LESS compilation and uglification automatically.       Only our main.less file is included in compilation all other files       must be imported from this file.           less        build          files            lt builddir gtassetslt pkg.name gtlt pkg.version gt.css lt appfiles.less gt                ,       compile          files            lt builddir gtassetslt pkg.name gtlt pkg.version gt.css lt appfiles.less gt         ,         options            cleancss true,           compress true                     ,             jshint defines the rules of our linter as well as which files we       should check. This file, all javascript sources, and all our unit tests       are linted based on the policies listed in options. But we can also       specify exclusionary patterns by prefixing them with an exclamation       point  this is useful when code comes from a third party but is       nonetheless inside src.           jshint        src [          lt appfiles.js gt       ],       test [         lt appfiles.jsunit gt       ],       gruntfile [         Gruntfile.js       ],       options          curly true,         immed true,         newcap true,         noarg true,         sub true,         boss true,         eqnull true       ,       globals      ,             coffeelint does the same as jshint, but for CoffeeScript.       CoffeeScript is not the default in ngBoilerplate, so were just using       the defaults here.           coffeelint        src          files            src [ lt appfiles.coffee gt ]                ,       test          files            src [ lt appfiles.coffeeunit gt ]                     ,             HTML2JS is a Grunt plugin that takes all of your template files and       places them into JavaScript files as strings that are added to       AngularJSs template cache. This means that the templates too become       part of the initial payload as one JavaScript file. Neat           html2js                 These are the templates from srcapp.               app          options            base srcapp         ,         src [ lt appfiles.atpl gt ],         dest lt builddir gttemplatesapp.js       ,                 These are the templates from srccommon.               common          options            base srccommon         ,         src [ lt appfiles.ctpl gt ],         dest lt builddir gttemplatescommon.js            ,             The Karma configurations.           karma        options          configFile lt builddir gtkarmaunit.js       ,       unit          port 9019,         background true       ,       continuous          singleRun true            ,             The index task compiles the index.html file as a Grunt template. CSS       and JS files coexist here but they get split apart later.           index                  During development, we dont want to have wait for compilation,         concatenation, minification, etc. So to avoid these steps, we simply         add all script files directly to the ltheadgt of index.html. The         src property contains the list of included files.               build          dir lt builddir gt,         src [           lt vendorfiles.js gt,           lt builddir gtsrc.js,           lt html2js.common.dest gt,           lt html2js.app.dest gt,           lt vendorfiles.css gt,           lt builddir gtassetslt pkg.name gtlt pkg.version gt.css         ]       ,                 When it is time to have a completely compiled application, we can         alter the above to include only a single JavaScript and a single CSS         file. Now were back               compile          dir lt compiledir gt,         src [           lt concat.compilejs.dest gt,           lt vendorfiles.css gt,           lt builddir gtassetslt pkg.name gtlt pkg.version gt.css         ]            ,             This task compiles the karma template so that changes to its file array       dont have to be managed manually.           karmaconfig        unit          dir lt builddir gt,         src [            lt vendorfiles.js gt,           lt html2js.app.dest gt,           lt html2js.common.dest gt,           lt testfiles.js gt         ]            ,             And for rapid development, we have a watch set up that checks to see if       any of the files listed below change, and then to execute the listed        tasks when they do. This just saves us from having to type grunt into       the commandline every time we want to see what were working on we can       instead just leave grunt watch running in a background terminal. Set it       and forget it, as Ron Popeil used to tell us.             But we dont need the same thing to happen for all the files.            delta                 By default, we want the Live Reload to work for all tasks this is         overridden in some tasks like this file where browser resources are         unaffected. It runs by default on port 35729, which your browser         plugin should autodetect.               options          livereload true       ,                 When the Gruntfile changes, we just want to lint it. In fact, when         your Gruntfile changes, it will automatically be reloaded               gruntfile          files Gruntfile.js,         tasks [ jshintgruntfile ],         options            livereload false                ,                 When our JavaScript source files change, we want to run lint them and         run our unit tests.               jssrc          files [            lt appfiles.js gt         ],         tasks [ jshintsrc, karmaunitrun, copybuildappjs ]       ,                 When our CoffeeScript source files change, we want to run lint them and         run our unit tests.               coffeesrc          files [            lt appfiles.coffee gt         ],         tasks [ coffeelintsrc, coffeesource, karmaunitrun, copybuildappjs ]       ,                 When assets are changed, copy them. Note that this will not copy new         files, so this is probably not very useful.               assets          files [            srcassets         ],         tasks [ copybuildappassets, copybuildvendorassets ]       ,                 When index.html changes, we need to compile it.               html          files [ lt appfiles.html gt ],         tasks [ indexbuild ]       ,                 When our templates change, we only rewrite the template cache.               tpls          files [            lt appfiles.atpl gt,            lt appfiles.ctpl gt         ],         tasks [ html2js ]       ,                 When the CSS files change, we need to compile and minify them.               less          files [ src.less ],         tasks [ lessbuild ]       ,                 When a JavaScript unit test file changes, we only want to lint it and         run the unit tests. We dont want to do any live reloading.               jsunit          files [           lt appfiles.jsunit gt         ],         tasks [ jshinttest, karmaunitrun ],         options            livereload false                ,                 When a CoffeeScript unit test file changes, we only want to lint it and         run the unit tests. We dont want to do any live reloading.               coffeeunit          files [           lt appfiles.coffeeunit gt         ],         tasks [ coffeelinttest, karmaunitrun ],         options            livereload false                                 initialize Grunt with taskConfig task gt via initConfig method       grunt.initConfig grunt.util..extend taskConfig, userConfig           In order to make it safe to just compile or copy only what was changed,     we need to ensure we are starting from a clean, fresh build. So we rename     the watch task to delta thats why the configuration var above is     delta and then add a new task called watch that does a clean build     before watching for changes.         name task watch gt preform task gt watch for code changes amp update browser       grunt.renameTask watch, delta    grunt.registerTask watch, [ build, karmaunit, delta ]          The default task is to build and compile.       grunt.registerTask default, [ build, compile ]          The build task gets your app ready to run for development and testing.       grunt.registerTask build, [     clean, html2js, jshint, coffeelint, coffee, lessbuild,     concatbuildcss, copybuildappassets, copybuildvendorassets,     copybuildappjs, copybuildvendorjs, copybuildvendorcss, indexbuild, karmaconfig,     karmacontinuous    ]         The compile task gets your app ready for deployment by concatenating and     minifying your code.       grunt.registerTask compile, [     lesscompile, copycompileassets, ngAnnotate, concatcompilejs, uglify, indexcompile   ]         A utility function to get all app JavaScript sources.       function filterForJS  files       return files.filter function  file         return file.match .js                  A utility function to get all app CSS sources.       function filterForCSS  files       return files.filter function  file         return file.match .css                   The index.html template includes the stylesheet and javascript sources     based on dynamic names calculated in this Gruntfile.

Negative 5769 pIve been on the lookout for a numerical library to use within a C  F application recently. The GNU scientific library GSL was one of those I came across. Ive downloaded the library and built it in Visual Studio 2012. This resulted in some .dll files.p  pI dont have an indepth understanding of how .dlls and .NET assemblies work, but I assumed that building the GSL solution in VS2012 would result in .dll files containing IL code and methods which I could then call from other CLR languages, such as e.g. my C and F projects. When trying to add one of the .dlls libgsld.dll in my VS2012 project, however, I get the message A reference to ...libgsld.dll could not be added. Please make sure that the file is accessible, and that it is a valid assembly or COM component.p  pWhy cant I build the GSL into .NET assemblies Im sure this is a trivial question, but I thought that one main benefits of C compared to e.g. C is that it easily compiles on different platforms, and I expected this to include compiling into ILp

Negative 5769 pI seem to be facing a rather odd issue with RedirectFromLoginPage and pages across folders.p  pIve a website with Forms authentication enabled, with the Login page in the Forms folder and other aspx pages in the Reports folder. So to get to a report you would go  a hrefhttpServernameReportsReport1.aspx relnofollowhttpServernameReportsReport1.aspxa and if youre not logged in, youll be redirected to the Login page   a hrefhttpServernameFormsLogin.aspxReturnUrl..ReportsReport1.aspx relnofollowhttpServernameFormsLogin.aspxReturnUrl..ReportsReport1.aspxa, which seems right.p  pIn my aspx code on the login page, once I check the Login info and create the Authcookie I then check if Ive a ReturnUrl and if I do, I use  codeSystem.Web.Security.FormsAuthentication.RedirectFromLoginPageusername, falsecode for redirection.p  pNote the redirected url for the Login page   a hrefhttpServernameFormsLogin.aspxReturnUrl..ReportsReport1.aspx relnofollowhttpServernameFormsLogin.aspxReturnUrl..ReportsReport1.aspxa seems right in principle, but on logging in the redirect never happens, Im not even sure what is going on, it just sits there and then comes up with a No Data received in Chrome  netERREMPTYRESPONSE.p  pHowever, if I try with a hrefhttpServernameFormsLogin.aspxReturnUrlReportsReport1.aspx relnofollowhttpServernameFormsLogin.aspxReturnUrlReportsReport1.aspxa, the redirect happens as expected, note the difference beingbr codeReturnUrlReportsReport1.aspxcode that works versus codeReturnUrl..ReportsReport1.aspxcode which does not, though the former is incorrect and the latter is correct from a folder standpoint.p  pAm I missing something very trivial is the redirect not happening from the context of the Login page, I can step in and correct the issue by removing the leading .. or else use Respsone.Redirect which works with the code..ReportsReport1.aspxcode, but I would expect the framework to do proper redirection since the rest of the stuff is being handled by Forms Authentication.p  pEDIT 1   Ive checked IIS logs, and I see no mention of the Redirects for the code..ReportsReport1.aspxcode scenario, which makes sense since the redirects never happen.p
Negative 5769 pIm using the MobileFirstStarter image available on IBM Bluemix. p  pI know the MobileFirstStarter image has some limitations such as allowing only one runtime, and deployed assets getting wiped out every time you redeploy the container, but is there a limitation on adding additional wlapp and adapters to this image using Dockerfilep  pMore detailsp  pI can create a new container based on the MFStarter image by using a Dockerfile, either via the ICE command line interface or the delivery pipeline on IBM DevOps Services. p  pHowever, I would like to have instructions on the Dockerfile to add files i.e. .wlapp and .adapter from my local environment to the MobileFirst Server, so when the image is built and the container is started, those applications and adapters will already be in the MobileFirst Servers catalog i.e. seen on the Servers console. p  pMy docker file simply starts with the default MFStarter image, then adds the content from DEPLOYDIR folder to emoptibmwlpusrserversBluemixServerdropinsem.p  pWhat would be wrong with this configuration The container is deployed successfully, I open the MFServer console, but I cant see the wlapp and adapters that came from my local DEPLOYDIR, only the default ones related to the WishList sample application that comes with the MFStarter image.p  pFull Dockerfile content belowp  precodefrom registry.ng.bluemix.netibmmobilefirststarterlatest  ENV DEPLOYDIR bin   Add wlapp files ADD DEPLOYDIR.wlapp optibmwlpusrserversBluemixServerdropins   Add adapter files ADD DEPLOYDIR.adapter optibmwlpusrserversBluemixServerdropins codepre  pThanksp
