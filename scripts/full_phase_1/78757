Positive 78757 pIm trying to figure out how to properly write an Ember test helper that performs its own async operations and tests that themselves involve async operations not necessarily wrapped in async helpers.  The examples on the Ember site a hrefhttpguides.emberjs.comv2.0.0testingtesthelperstoccustomtesthelpers relnofollowherea and a hrefhttpemberjs.comapiclassesEmber.Test.htmlmethodregisterAsyncHelper relnofollowherea both show async test helpers that are merely constructed by calling preexisting async helpers, not code that creates its own async condition.p  pBackground  Im working on a service thats going to have a REST back end fronted by EmberEmber Data.  I want to write some test code that talks to the actual server in order to allow us to work out details on how EmberData interacts with the server.  Before you jump up and down about how integration tests should use fake data so that they can be run in CI mode, what weve done is set up a strongseparatestrong Ember app whose sole purpose in life is to exercise the data model through Ember Data for the purposes of debugging the strongserverstrong.  Thus, these are really strongserverstrong tests, designed to ensure the compatibility between the server and Ember Data, not integration tests on the Ember application itself.p  pThus, what some of the tests want to do isp  ol liExecute an AJAX query to the server to trigger it to set up a certain data set.  Essentially, invoking some special test code inside the server to create appropriate preconditions.li liEmploy the Ember Data API in order to retrieve data from the server or write data to it in the same manner that the real Ember application would.li liEnsure that we get back what we expect, or that the data in the server looks correct afterwards.li ol  pBoth of the first two operates are clearly asynchronous.  The first would very clearly be a nice async helper.  The second doesnt necessarily have to be a helper because each invocation is going to be different, but clearly the test itself needs to wait on the promise that methods from codeDS.storecode return.p  pFinally, other stuff I knowp  ol liI understand the fundamental theory behind how Embers test helper work.  Chained promises, etc.li liThe builtin async helpers e.g. codeclickcode, codevisitcode all finish with codereturn app.testHelpers.waitcode li licodewaitcode returns an instance of codeRSVP.Promisecode which does a lot of processing to make sure things have moreorless cleaned up before it resolves, including dealing with outstanding AJAX queries, test waiters, etc.li licodewaitcode can interact with test waiters, if required.li ol  pThus, it would seem that if my async helper did the same thing as Embers i.e. codereturn app.testHelpers.waitcode this would be sufficient for my AJAX helper, since codewaitcode would take care of waiting for the AJAX transaction to complete.  This doesnt necessary answer the broader question, however.p  pOK, now the real questionsp  ol lipIf I want to write my own arbitrary async helper, is it sufficient for me to return an instance of codeRSVP.Promisecode that will be resolved at the appropriate time  Or is it necessary to actually use the codewaitcode mechanism and possibly test waiters because of some additional Ember dependencies on the behavior of the codewaitcode mechanism  pli lipDoes Ember have any special requirements for tests involving async operations midstream  Or are the a hrefhttpsapi.qunitjs.comasync relnofollowQUnit mechanisms for async testsa sufficientpli lipDoes Ember have any kind of wrapper for the QUnit async stuff  The way that it hides the QUnitness behind its set of test calls.pli lipDo Ember Data interactions with the server have a dependency on the Ember run looppli ol  pOK, I think thats clearly enough for a single question.   I greatly appreciate anybody whos willing to educate me.p
Positive 78757 pI have a route where I need to fetch associated data that is not available in the parent routes, so I need to basically reload the model and in the process provide JSONAPI with the include directive to embed other models. So the route looks like this.p  precodeimport Ember from ember   route for patients1appointments export default Ember.Route.extend   model function      const query               id this.modelForpatient.getid,             include appointments,appointments.practitioner           ,           success  functionpatient              return patient.getappointments                 return this.store.queryRecordpatient, query.thensuccess     codepre  pThe success callback is fetching the appointments a second time, which maybe isnt surprising, but it should seemingly also know that it has those in the store locally. So, Im trying to resolve a reasonable way to set the model to the set of appointment models coming back. For various reasons, we dont want the logic of this specific request to live in the adapters, since for example we may not always need the practitioner side loaded anytime we get the patients appointments. Any ideasp
Positive 78757 pIm using Ember 2.0 with emberdata 2.0.p  pIn Rails its very common to model forms and components using real instances of models. For a codepostsnewcode form you would pass in a codePost.newcode and use that inside the codeform.html.erbcode template.p  pIn Ember that is made difficult because calling codenew Postcode creates a broken model. Instead youre encouraged to use stores, and with that use codethis.store.createRecordpostcode.p  pThis is fine, but not when building isolated components. For example a form where the user can add multiple models, say a category creator. In my head the structure would be something as followsp  pcodecategoryformtemplate.hbscodep  precodeltbutton action addCategorygtAdd categoryltbuttongt each categories as category     input valuecategory.name each ltbutton action savegtSaveltbuttongt codepre  pThen the component.js would be something likep  pcodecategoryformcomponent.jscodep  precodeimport Ember from ember import Category from appcategorymodel  export default Ember.Component.extend     categories [],      actions          addCategory               THIS DOES NOT WORK             this.getcategories.pushObjectnew Category         ,          save              this.sendActionsaveCategories, this.getcategories                codepre  pThe example above does work, but would instead require codethis.store.createRecordcode. But as far as I know the component does not have access to the store. This is sane because that would be the component messing with a global state. Also when using codecreateRecordcode you end up with lots of residual models in the store if the user navigates away without saving the model.p  pI want the codecategoryformcode component in this example to be completely isolated from the rest of the global state.p  pMy question is, how would this be handled correctly using ember logicp

Negative 78757 pI have a design question. When writing an application where there are several components that share some attributes, and differ in others both in terms of GUI windows forms and back end, how would one theoretically approach thisp  pFor example, I have an application where I have 4 different types of a product. The forms for entering product details all share 3 different fields. So far, easy  have a base class, then derive the 4 forms out of this base class. However, say, 2 products share a certain behaviour which is THE SAME for both of them. Of course, I could have an interface which defines methods, then have these 2 product entry forms implement this interface, but since interface provides no default implementation, wouldnt it be a waste to do that Since I would have to provide an implementation in each class and if it is exactly the same, it would be code repetition.p  pI could of course put this method in the base class and have 2 forms derived from it. If my forms share more than one common element and not share other elements, what would be the sanest, most logical way to represent this without having to rip my hair outp
Negative 78757 pIm trying to create a webbased app that can interact with Exchange server globally.  Meaning, I need it to have the ability to view, change, delete, and create all emails, calendars, appointments, tasks, notes, etc... across the domain.  I am using .Net, and have been looking into sinks, but wasnt sure if this was the best route to go.

Negative 78757 pI know there have been some similar questions to this, but they havent helped me.p  pIm trying to install Wordpress 2.8.4 on my XP box, with strongIIS 5.1strong. I installed MySQL, and found that it was possible to install Wordpress through the Microsoft Web Platform Installer. After installing Wordpress the install worked fine, I proceeded to the next step in the Wordpress installation documentation, which is to open wpadmininstall.php in your browser. IIS seemed to not be interpreting PHP, and when searching for the best way to install it, I saw that it is also available with Microsoft Web Platform Installer, so I installed it that way. However, my IIS isnt interpreting PHP still. I do not know what the problem is, but Im going to reboot right now and see if that helps, as I didnt reboot after the install even though it didnt say I have to. Any help would be greatly appreciated. Thanksp

However, if I put the same thing in the code inside the Premake generated project, all those math functions end up unresolved.p  pNow comparing the linking command from the native XCode project with my generated XCode project, they seem pretty identical except that my generated project links other libs as well.p  pNative projectp  precodeDeveloperusrbing4.2 arch x8664 dynamiclib isysroot DeveloperSDKsMacOSX10.6.sdk Lsomepath Fsomepath filelist somefile installname somename mmacosxversionmin10.6 singlemodule compatibilityversion 1 currentversion 1 o somename codepre  pGenerated projectp  precodeDeveloperusrbing4.2 arch x8664 dynamiclib Lsomepath Fsomepath filelist somefile installname somename isysroot DeveloperSDKsMacOSX10.6.sdk mmacosxversionmin10.6 somelib.a somelib2.a somelib.dylib somelib2.dylib singlemodule compatibilityversion 1 currentversion 1 o somename codepre  pAny help or hints about how to proceed would be most appreciated.

Negative 78757 pThe default floating point type in Java is the double.  If you hard code a constant like code2.5code into your program, Java makes it a double automatically.  When you do an operation on floats or ints that could potentially benefit from more precision, the type is promoted to a double.p  pBut in the Android API, everything seems to be a float from sound volumes to rectangle coordinates.  Theres a structure called codeRectFcode used in most drawing  the F is for float.  Its really a pain for programmers who are casting promoted doubles back to codefloatcode pretty often.  Dont we all agree that Java code is messy and verbose enough as it isp  pUsually math coprocessors and accelerators prefer double in Java because it corresponds to one of the internal types.  Is there something about Androids Dalvik VM that prefers floats for some reason  Or are all the floats just a result of perversion in API designp

I want a code template that is contextaware of the objects, and once selected, i want it to present me with the methods of this object.p  pSo far, I have this template, and it works fine it shows me all objects that are in my testp  precodeEasyMock.expectavar.cursor codepre  pIt will write me the EasyMock.expect part, and then present me with a list of objects I can select. Once selected, I get a dot and the cursor at the right, so all I need to do is press CTRLSPACE in order to see the methods of this object.p  pWhat I want is to be presented with this list of methods. p  pIs this possible And if yes, how I cant find any solution. Perhaps there is no such template variable yetp

Negative 78757 pIm trying to get screenshots from a web page with multiple browsers. Just experimenting with Selenium RC, I wrote code like thisp  precodevar sel  new DefaultSeleniumserver, 4444, target, url sel.Start sel.Openurl sel.WaitForPageToLoad30000 var imageString  sel.CaptureScreenshotToString codepre  pThis basically works, but in most cases the screenshot is of a blank browser window, because the page is not yet ready for display. It kind of works if I add a sleep just after the WaitForPageToLoad, but that slows down the fast browsers andor may be to short for the slower browsers or under load.p  pA typical solution for this seems to be to wait for the presence of a certain element. However, this is meant as a simple generic solution to get a screenshot of a local web page with as many browsers as possible to test the layout and I dont want to have to enter certain element names or whatever. Its a simple tool where you just enter the Selenium Server URL and the URL you want to test, and get the screenshots back.p  pAny advicep

Negative 78757 pI am currently trying to figure out what the best way is to create my objects on my current PHP 5.2 project. I basicly have a Registry which returns objects by keys. If the Registry does not have an object with the specified key it will try to create one by calling a factory method that is supplied to the registry by construction. Look at the following code to calrifyp  precodeinterface IFactory      public function createProduct key    class Registry      private melements  array      private mfactory     public function construct IFactory factory              thisgtmfactory  factory          public function getElement key             if  arraykeyexists key, thisgtmelements                    thisgtmelements[key]  thisgtmfactorygtcreateProduct key               return thisgtmelements[key]       codepre  pBecause I have different of categories of objects Id like to store in different registries I wrap a Registry oject into a singleton for each category, like thisp  precodeclass SpecialRegistry     private static instance  null     public static function getInstance             if selfinstance  null                     selfinstance  new Registry new SpecialFactory                  return selfinstance      codepre  pMy Special class is rather complex and big with alot of different attributes and composition objects. Because I do not want to bind my Special class to any specific backend I was going to have different Factories for each different backend eg MySQL database or file stream. So I would move the loading and initialization logic to the Factories. This however will only work if all fields in the Special class are public to the Factory. They shouldnt however be public to the rest of the application.p  pIn C I could use friends to circumvent this problem.  Also here on stack overflow I read on nearly the same topic, but applied to C. It said I should simply set all fields public in the Special class and have the Factory only return an Interface that exposes the methods and attributes I want to be public to the application. But since PHP does not support return type hinting I am not able to return only an interface that the Special class implements. Another way I came up with would be to actually have the SpecialFactory inherit from the Special class making it possible to access private and protected fields from the factory. This is what I called Bastard Factory since the factory inherits from its own product.p  pId wish to know if anyone of you guys can come up with a better way of achieving what I want. Or am I completely off track and yielding the initialization process to the factory is an absolute nogo Im curious on your opinionsp

Negative 78757 pSo I have a Microsoft.Office.Interop.Excel.Workbook object. It basically uses a template Excel file to construct itself.

Negative 78757 pThis is a continuation of the issue described in a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions4390740usingeclipselinkinjavacoderunfrommatlabUsing eclipselink in java code run from matlaba and is similar to the issue described in a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions4376565javajpaclassformatlabJava JPA Class for MATLABa, but the accepted solutions described there have not completely solved the issue.p  pI am trying to use eclipselink to connect to an oracle database in matlab. From the answers in the previous posts, I put the code on the static classpath in the classpath.txt. When I do this I am able to use it, but only if I create the EntityManager via a call to Persistence.createEntityManager... within the first few seconds after matlab loads. If I wait more than 5 second after starting up Matlab, the exact same code gives the No Persistence provided exception. I have confirmed that the times that it does work, it is actually using a different class loader than the times that it does not. The only thing that I can think of is that the classpath is initializing on a separate thread than the Matlab console and that if I run it quickly, then Matlabs OSGI classloader is not initialized yet so it uses the default java class loader.p  pThis is obviously not an acceptable solution and doesnt seem to have really solved the reason of why Matlab classloader can not find the persistence.xml. Does anyone have any further ideas Could it possibly be in how I am initializing eclipselink Neither the guy that worked on this code before me nor I have been able to figure out a way to get it to recognize the persistence.xml in any way other than putting it in the METAINF folder on the classpath.p

Negative 78757 pI am new to hibernate and transactions.p  pI have a row in a table that marks it as inprogress state.  I have a second table that is used to write rows that are to be received by the inprogress worker just before it wraps up, and this effectively adds to its worklist.p  pThere are 2 transactions that are using these 2 tablesp  p1 a transaction fetches the inprogress dummy row for the maximum sequence number column.  When it sees this row, it must know that that row has been committed.  What is the minimum isolation  Then it checks to see if the rows inprogress flag is true.  If inprogress, it knows that there is another longrunning thread not a single transaction that has already committed that row to inprogress, and it adds its new piece of data to an auxilliary table, expecting that the longrunning thread will getremoveprocess the rows from the auxilliary table and do something with them and finally set inprogress to false in a single atomic transaction.p  p2 the second thread starts and sees that inprogress is committed to true upon its start.  It does several pieces of work in separate transactions.  Then it does one final atomic transaction 1 read the auxilliary data that several of the thread 1s wrote to the second table, 2 removes them and processes them, 3 writes inprogress column of inprogress row to false.p  pMy first question is, for these 2 related transactions, what minimum isolation levels do I need to make them work properly in that when thread 2 finishes, it will have processed all the auxilliary data that thread 1 added to second table B when it saw the inprogess state.p  pAlso, Im very concerned that when I use hibernate setter to set the inprogress state to false in thread 2, that I must do it BEFORE fetching, removing and processing the auxilliary data.

The delimiters may be individually specialised, an example specialization for stdset is included, as well as an example of using custom delimiters.p  pThe helper wraparray can be used to print raw C arrays. emUpdateem Pairs and tuples are available for printing default delimiters are round brackets.p  pThe enableif type trait requires C0x, but with some modifications it should be possible to make a C98 version of this. Tuples require variadic templates, hence C0x.p  pI have asked Sven to post the solution here so that I can accept it, but in the meantime Id like to post the code myself for reference. emUpdateem Sven has now posted his code below, which I made the accepted answer. My own code uses container type traits, which work for me but may cause unexpected behaviour with noncontainer classes that provide iterators.p  pemHeader prettyprint.hemp  precodeifndef HPRETTYPRINT define HPRETTYPRINT   include lttypetraitsgt include ltiostreamgt include ltutilitygt include lttuplegt   namespace std       Predeclarations of container types so we dont actually have to include the relevant headers if not needed, speeding up compilation time.     templatelttypename T, typename TTraits, typename TAllocatorgt class set   namespace prettyprint        SFINAE type trait to detect a container based on whether Tconstiterator exists.

Negative 78757 pToday I designed a utility class as part of a larger project, an extraction if you will. I would like to get some feedback on the design, i.e., feedback on things like use of module vs. class, naming, where it should live in a Rails project, e.g., in RAILSROOTlib or in appmodels and relatedly where its test should live. For fun and learning I created several different versions, some class based and some module based, some with use of modulefunction and some without. Now I am interested to get your input. It is an open ended question and Ill give points to anyone with helpful feedback and Ill probably check the answer box for the one I like the best if I end up liking it better than what I created. It would be cool to know if there are any open source implementations of similar that are available to compare against too.p  pUpdate February 10, 2011 22238 PM I see now this is bonehead design because the times will be frozen at the time when the module enters RAM, making the time ranges not work as expected.p  pUpdate February 10, 2011 44642 PM Much better design now that actually works and can be seen here with its test file a hrefhttpsgist.github.com821722 relnofollowhttpsgist.github.com821722ap  precode PeriodUtility is a module that provides the ability to   1. get select option values for a particular keyed period set    2. provides a keyed lookup mechanism to return the start and end times for a particular time range in a particular period set   3. allows you to provide your own period sets see note below  Usage     In model       You might want to define a named scope to scope a model by time range, for example      namedscope bytimerange, lambda starttime, endtime         conditions gt [updatedon between  and , starttime, endtime]  if starttime ampamp endtime          In helper       options  PeriodUtility.optionsforqtd    In view       lt selecttag foo, optionsforselectoptions, ltselected value indices heregt,  gt    In controller       include PeriodUtility  this is optional, but lets us make the method call more concise                              and more functional in style by leaving out the receiver      foos  Foo.bytimerangeperiodstartforqtd, monthtodate, periodendforqtd, monthtodate   Note you can provide your own period sets to PeriodUtility via  PeriodUtility.periodsets  foo gt [[bar, Bar, 1.day.ago, Time.now]] module PeriodUtility     periodsets       qtd gt      [       option value, option text, time period start, time period end      [today, Today, Time.now.beginningofday, Time.now.endofday],      [yesterday, Yesterday, Time.now.yesterday.beginningofday, Time.now.yesterday.endofday],      [weektodate, Week to Date, Time.now.beginningofweek, Time.now],      [monthtodate, Month to Date, Time.now.beginningofmonth, Time.now],      [quartertodate, Quarter to Date, Time.now.beginningofquarter, Time.now]     ],     ytd gt      [       option value, option text, time period start, time period end      [today, Today, Time.now.beginningofday, Time.now.endofday],      [yesterday, Yesterday, Time.now.yesterday.beginningofday, Time.now.yesterday.endofday],      [weektodate, Week to Date, Time.now.beginningofweek, Time.now],      [monthtodate, Month to Date, Time.now.beginningofmonth, Time.now],      [quartertodate, Quarter to Date, Time.now.beginningofquarter, Time.now],      [yeartodate, Year to Date, Time.now.beginningofyear, Time.now]     ]       modulefunction  declare subsequently defined functions to be Ruby module functions ala Rubys Math or Kernel modules     def periodsetsperiodsetshash     periodsets  periodsetshash   end     usage PeriodUtility.optionsforqtd     or     include PeriodUtility    optionsforqtd   def optionsforperiodsetkey     periodsets[periodsetkey].collecte [ e[1], e[0] ].unshift[none, nil]   end     usage PeriodUtility.periodstartforytd, yesterday     or     include PeriodUtility    periodstartforqtd, quartertodate   def periodstartforperiodsetkey, key     timeperiod  periodlookupperiodsetkey, key     timeperiod[2] if timeperiod ampamp timeperiod[2]   end     usage PeriodUtility.periodendforytd, yesterday     or     include PeriodUtility    periodendforqtd, quartertodate   def periodendforperiodsetkey, key     timeperiod  periodlookupperiodsetkey, key     timeperiod[3] if timeperiod ampamp timeperiod[3]   end     not typically used except as private method of module though not explicitly scoped private   def periodlookupperiodsetkey, key     periodsets[periodsetkey].selecte e[0]  key.first if periodsets[periodsetkey]   end  end codepre

Negative 78757 pDo XHR objects hog the sockets that they use Or do they share sockets with the other parts of the browser  p  pBecause HTTP is stateless, browsers can send several requests and receive responses in any particular order.  But it seems to me that because an XHR object usually is tied to a callback function, it must hog the socket it used to make its request until it receives a response.  I just want to know whether or not this is the case.  If it is not the case that an XHR object opens and hold exclusive access to a socket during the course of its operation, then how is a request intended for it identified and given back to the objectp  pThanks.p

Negative 78757 pThis is more of a general question as I have found relatively little information on the net on how to best organize source code.p  pThe way I currently have laid out my code is to have one project in VS compiling a lib, and then two console application projects on top of that, one for unit tests and one to execute the code in the lib.p  pIn the main project, I have a folder called src containing my src code. This source code is then structured into various folders, each holding .h and .cpp files. File names match class names. Folders match namespaces, so every folder is in its own namespace.p  pI thought this was quite a sensible approach, until I discovered that visual studio 2010 hickups under this approach if two .cpp files have the same name albeit in different folders and namespaces, because all .obj files are placed into the same temp directory Debug or Release.p  pThis has led me to wonder, as surely the point of maintaining lots of namespaces and subnamespaces would be to enable you to have identically named classes and hence files. Some googleing turned up the solution to individually select conflicting files and place the .obj file into a different place, but some hint at worse performance, and it does seem a bit of an odd approach.p  pSo I am just wondering, is this not a sensible layout Or do people usually compile each folder into a static library and then link those Or do you just maintain different filenames Do you then keep on matching filenames to class names Because if you do, you wouldnt really need subnamespaces either, as the whole project could just be in one namespace...p  pI wonder, I ponder... not sure if this question is concrete enough. I guess my immediate question assuming the layout is somewhat sensible is how to get around the conflicting obj files I am just thinking of renaming the files while maintaining the class names. But I dont like that solution so much.p  pThanks sorry for long questionp  pP.S. the source folder should be compatible with gcc under linuxp

Negative 78757 pI have some SPs that I want to be under source control, but the question is what do I addp  pIdeally I want some way to purely get the source of the SP, however all I can get is alter, create, etc scripts which I do not consider to be the raw source. The closest I can get is running sphelptext mysp.p  pIs there some way to purely get the source of an SPp  pI am running SQL Server 2008 R2.p  pEDIT I understand the usefullness of being able to grab what is in source control and updatedeploy a SP, however I am firmly against this. This code is useful situationally, irrelevant when making diffs to see changes and generic violates DRY principle. eg. SQL Server 2010 has a new way to create and drop sps.. need to update the source for all my SPs. If I wanted something like this I would be much more inclined to make a script that will deploy a SP to a server eg. deploy dpmysp prod.p  pIs there a way to get just the guts of an SP Or is it actually stored as a create procedure scriptp  pEDIT2 p  pCheers guys.p  pI dont object to versioning settings and references or deployment scripts which is the best analogy IMO as they exist in emoneem place and are reusable nuggets of goodness. The key sucky thing about this is the same deployment code exists in emmanyem places and must be maintained in many places. There is no dependency between this code and each sp, so it adds cruft to every sp. Why dont we add generic deployment code to every file in our solution so they are self deployablep  pAnyway, I guess we will have to agree to disagree on this one. I am definitely being a purist and I dont think there is much practical benefit to what I want, but for me being super anal about development is what makes it fun p  pNoone helped me get closer to what I want than sphelptext mysp and I am guessing it is impossible at this point or convinced me I should be checking in something else, so I am going to leave the question unanswered.p  pThanks again.p

I have configured both independently and was able to access from internet. However, I only have one IP address so I have configured port forwarding on my router to forward http requests  port 80 to the web site on my NAS where I have provided a hyperlink on the default html page to the IP camera hrefhttp192.168.1.200....html. From home the link works because the internet browser is running on a computer on my network. But browsing from a computer ouside of my router  the internet the link does not work.

Negative 78757 pLets say I am going to deploy a server application thats likely to be placed behind a NATfirewall and I dont want to ask users to tweak their NAT port mapping. In other words, connections to the server are impossible, but my app is a server application by nature, i.e. it sends back objects per URI.p  pNow, Im thinking about initiating connections from the server periodically to see what requests are there to be responded to. Im going to use HTTP via port 80 as something that would likely be working through NATfirewall from virtually anywhere.p  pThe question is, are there any standard considerations and common practices of implementing a client that can act as a server at the application level, specifically using HTTP Any special HTTP headers Design patternsp  pE.g. I am thinking about the following schemep  ul liThe client which is my logical server sends a dummy HTTP request to the serverli liThe server responds back with nonstandard headers codeXRequestURIcode, codeXHostcode, codeXIfModifiedSincecode etc, in other words, request headers wrapped into Xxxx as they are not standard in this situation also requests to keep the connection aliveli liThe client responds with a POST request that sends the requested object again, uses wrapped headers e.g. codeXStatuscode, etcli ul  pUnless there is a more standard way of doing something like this, do you think my approach is plausiblep  pstrongEditstrong an interesting discussion took place a hrefhttpwww.reddit.comrwebdevcommentsk3mydhttpclientactingasapseudoserveristhere relnofollowon reddit hereap

Negative 78757 pI am attempting to clean out a ton of spam that was injected into a clients blog. One of the issues is that the hack that originally did the injection did so in a way that it actually wound up with malformed multiembeded links, so I am having trouble grabbing them in a concise way.p  pMy thought was to dump all of the links in the posts table into a text file, then remove the valid ones from that list, and from there create a bash script that removed the malicious ones one line at a time. I was trying to use a nongreedy grep to dump the links, otherwise in cases where there was more than one link in the post it would go from the start of the first link to the end of the last one. This is the line I was usingp  precodegrep Po lta href[][][]gt.ltagt wpposts.sqlgtfulllinklist.txt codepre  pThe problem is happening when it tries to parse links embedded within other links. For instance, I get thisp  precodelta hrefhttpblogtorn.comimagesgtwhere lta hrefhttpclinesite.comimagesgtbuy n viagra ltagt codepre  pfrom a section like thisp  precodelta hrefhttpblogtorn.comimagesgtwhere lta hrefhttpclinesite.comimagesgtbuy n viagra ltagt  do you buy viagra  buy cialis phentermine  cheap levitra onlineltagt codepre  pNot all links are broken like this though, and if I clean out the ones output from the command above I think it will make it very difficult to track down the debris. What I think I need is either something that grabs the whole block ie. matching opening codelta hrefcode with the same number of closing codeltagtcode, or just the smallest inner match possible ie. greedy from the inside out and I  then do it in multiple passes, but I am open to other suggestions too. Any thoughts on this Thanks p

Ive written a helper to handle some functionality  I have a number of methods, which are as it should be declared STATIC. But, all of these methods are somehow working with the database, so I need to load a model. Currently, every method has a nonstatic variable like this p  blockquote   pcomment  new ModelCommentsbr   commentaddCommentabcp blockquote  pOK, it seems to be working, but then I wanted to get rid of this redundancy by using class attribute to hold the instance of the model with is class as well.p  pSomething like this p  blockquote   pprivate static comment   Declaring attributebr   selfcomment  new ModelComment  This is done within helper constuct methodbr   selfcommentaddCommentabc   And call it within the method.p blockquote  pBut, I got failed with strongCall to a member function addComment on a nonobjectstrongp  pQuestion is is it possible to do it  Maybe there are some other approaches p  pSorry for a long story and, thanks in advice Pp

Negative 78757 pI am planning to develop an application that can calculate the limit of an expression function given by the user.p  pI already have a functional expression evaluator, which will definitely come in handy. My idea is to calculate it like this I give the parameter a few values that get closer and closer to the point, but doesnt reach the point. At the end, I see if the difference between two consecutive results gets delsmaller or biggerdel closer or further from 0. If it gets delsmallerdel closer, this means that the limit is finite, infinite otherwise. After that, its easy to approximate a result.p  pIs there a better approach to this Or should I go with this onep  pThe application will accept functions that contain these mathematical operators code,,,,,code, functions like floor, logarithms, trigonometry, and 3 condition functions abs, min, max. So, for example a function which has a specific value for integer values, and another value for noninteger values is not accepted.p

However, when I drag to the right and down from top left to bottom righty with the mouse, the rectangle drawn starts from the bottom right and goes up to the top left but Im dragging the opposite way  from the top left to the bottom right  the sizeamount moved seems precisely right, though.p  pMoreover, the point at which the draw operation begin is not in exactly the right spot, either  it starts a little to the left of and above my initial point.p  pNote Im using codePointToScreencode because the dragging operation is taking place on a codeTableLayoutPanelcode, which has been placed on top of the form.

but not the bulk attachment itself, YETp  precodeXMLStreamWriter sw  new MyXMLStreamWriter source.writeTosw codepre  pHopefully the attachment parser has not read all that part of the incoimuing HTTP stream yet, or if it has it has chunked it off into a file, where I can then read it chunk by chunk.  The trouble is that I cannot find a way of parsing Message that does not convert the incoming  into the base64 encoded data in the attachment. After I get the SAXStaX event indicating the start of the  element, it is followed by a characters event which is the base64 encoded data. Looking at the code for StreamMessage there is no way to insert any XMLReader or XMLStreamReader etc. in front of the existing XMLStreamReader that the Message is already bound to  not suprising as we are part way through message processing.  But that XMLStreamReader implementation is a com.sun.xml.ws.encoding.MtomCodecMtomXMLStreamReaderEx which always unpacks attachments in line into memory. There is no way to paramterize the com.sun.xml.ws.encoding.MtomCodec class so that it does not first pass events to its inner MtomXMLStreamReaderEx class which unpacks the attachment inline.p  pI tried to read the attachment into a temporary file and then substitute the Message context  attachments for a FileDataSource, but since Metro ignores these, that only had the effect of making the original DataSource throw a ReadOnce type error.p  precodeMapltString, DataHandlergt attachments  MapltString, DataHandlergt ctxt.getMessageContext.getjavax.xml.ws.handler.MessageContext.INBOUNDMESSAGEATTACHMENTS             HashMapltString, DataHandlergt clonedAttachments  new HashMapltString, DataHandlergtattachments             forString attachmentKey attachments.keySet                  StreamingDataHandler handler  StreamingDataHandler attachments.getattachmentKey                 File tempFile  File.createTempFileAttachment  attachmentKey, .xmlb64, new FileCUsersAdministratorworkspaceTool1TomcatWorkingDir                 handler.moveTotempFile                 FileDataSource newSource  new FileDataSourcetempFile                 clonedAttachments.putattachmentKey, new DataHandlernewSource                 System.out.printlnGot attachment   attachmentKey   of type   attachments.getattachmentKey                          ifattachments.isEmpty                  System.out.printlnGot No attachments                          else                  ctxt.getMessageContext.putjavax.xml.ws.handler.MessageContext.INBOUNDMESSAGEATTACHMENTS, clonedAttachments              codepre  pI tried also turning off MTOM in the provider by setting the annotation to disabledp  precodeMTOMenabledfalse  codepre  pand then removing it and then the StreamingAttachment annotation to no avail. I also set the  enablemtomfalse attribute in the endpoint element for it in the sunjaxws.xml file, again to no avail it seems that xopInclude parsing is hardwired. I do not want to change the wsdl because that I do want clients to use MTOM if possible.  but see my swaRef answer below  p  pI can make Metro do what I want if I use swaRef, but my understanding was that MTOM is the protocol that has gained support With the swaRef I have to edit the WSDL p  precodelttypesgt           ltxsdschema             xmlnshttpwww.w3.org2001XMLSchema             targetNamespacehttpswaRef.asynch.duke.example.org             elementFormDefaultqualifiedgt          ltxsdimport namespacehttpwsi.orgprofilesbasic1.1xsd                           schemaLocationhttpwww.wsi.orgprofilesbasic1.1swaref.xsdgt                ltcomplexType namesendBulkgt                 ltsequencegt                     ltelement namedata typewsiswaRef                         xmlnswsihttpwsi.orgprofilesbasic1.1xsdgt                 ltsequencegt             ltcomplexTypegt             ltelement namesendBulk typetnssendBulkgt codepre  pI also have to generate a new client and call the sendBulk method differentlyp  precodeFileDataSource newSource  new FileDataSourcefile DataHandler data  new DataHandlernewSource String result  port.sendBulkdata codepre  pBut now when I parse the data element I get the corresponding cid which I can then use to retrieve the attachment as I wishp  precodeDataHandler handler  attachments.getdataText.substringcid.length InputStream input  handler.getInputStream codepre  pSo, with MTOM and Metro though the attachments may have not been read up to the point where I parse the data element, or indeed streamed efficiently in chunks to a temporary file, I have no way to read the rest of the input message without reading the whole of the attachment into memory which seems self defeating Apart from dumping Metro  suggestions re Axis, CXF welcomed  is there any way around this anyone has discovered p  pLogged a hrefhttpjava.netjirabrowseJAXWS1070 relnofollowa feature requesta.p

Negative 78757 pI work at COMPANY and Im helping maintain LEGACYAPPLICATION.  Its written in visual basic 6.p  pI was faced with doing an unpleasantly elaborate nested if statement due to the lack of VB6s ability to perform short circuit evaluations in if statements which would simplify this a lot.  Ive tried AndAlso, but to no avail.  Must be a feature added after VB6.p  pSome genius on SO somewhere pointed out that you can trick a select case statement into working like a shortcircuiting if statement if you have the patience, so I tried that, and heres what I came up withp  precodeSelect Case True  pretend this is an ifelse statement     Case item Is Nothing Exit Sub  we got a nonelement     Case item Is Not Nothing And lastSelected Is Nothing Set lastSelected  item  we got our first good element     Case item  lastSelected Exit Sub  we already had what we got     Case Not item  lastSelected Set lastSelected  item  we got something new End Select codepre  pIts definitely a little unusual, and I had to make use of my fantastic whiteboard which, by the way, is pretty much the most useful programming resource besides a computer to make sure I had mapped all of the statements correctly.p  pHeres whats going on there I have an expensive operation which I would like to avoid repeating if possible.  lastSelected is a persistent reference to the value most recently passed to this calculation.  item is the parameter that was just received from the GUI.  If there has never been a call to the program before, lastSelected starts out as Nothing.  item can be Nothing too.  Additionally, if both lastSelected and item are the same something, skip the calculation.p  pIf I were writing this in C, I would writep  precodeif item  NULL  lastSelected  NULL ampamp itemgtoperatorlastSelected return else lastSelected  item codepre  pHowever, Im not.p  h2Questionh2  pHow can I rewrite this to look better and make more sense  Upvotes will be awarded to answers that say either YES and heres why X, Y, Z or NO, and heres why not X, Y, Z.p  h2Editsh2  pFixed the C statement to match the VB6 one they were supposed to be equivalentp

Negative 78757 pI have an application written in Python 2.7 that reads users file from the harddrive using os.walk.p  pThe application requires a UTF8 system locale we check the env variables before it starts because we handle files with Unicode characters audio files with the artist name in it for example, and want to make sure we can save these files with the correct file name to the filesystem.p  pSome of our users have UTF8 locales therefore a UTF8 fs, but still somehow manage to have ISO88591 files stored on their drive. This causes problems when our code tries to os.walk these directories as Python throws an exception when trying to decode this sequence of ISO88591 bytes using UTF8.p  pSo my question is, how do I get python to ignore this file and move on to the next one instead of aborting the ementireem os.walk. Should I just roll my own os.walk functionp  pEdit Until now weve been telling our users to use the convmv linux command to correct their filenames, however many users have various different types of encodings 88591, 88592, etc., and using convmv requires the user to make an educated guess on what files have what encoding before they run convmv on each one individually.p

Negative 78757 pI have a web application that is based on the users creating certain divs through a click function. When the user adds a div I also give them the ability of deleting said function. Each time the user adds a div it is pushed into an array. Then user can save the array and load it when they come back.p  pThe function to delete a div is nested within the function to add as that is the only way I have found make the function work.p  pThe problem I have is that I must also call the delete function within the load function to make delete button work before the add button is clicked. I tried just calling function out side either function but since there are no divs to begin with. So when the page loads and the delete button is clicked, it is implemented twice and ruins the application.p  pI am new to programming and what I am doing right now is mostly procedural, so any input work be appreciated. I feel like I am making a rookie mistake, the pseudo code is below.p  precodebutton.cickfunction     store div in array     add div to container     call remove function  function loadPage      retrieve stored array     add stored divs to container     call remove function  loadPage codepre

Such as when that UIView 2 is near the corner, so that the ScrollView moves a little to fully show UIView 2.p  pIf there is no way around this is there a way to update ScrollView from UIView 2 to scroll when its near a cornerp  pEditp  pI think I may have found a work around. Not sure if this will be accepted by Apple butp  pI just made a call to a instance variable that is  to self.superview which then allows me to talk back to my ScrollView within UIViews touchesMovedp  pin that i can call the method [ScrollView setContentOffsetCGPointcontentOffset animatedBOOLanimated] so my ScrollView gets updated as the subviewUIView2 moves close to the edge of the UIWindow. p  pThank you for the suggestions. p

I have read that unobtrusive first parses the document looking for existing validation, and if any is found, it will go no further.  The majority of the form is tied into the stock validation so I can not have it broken.  Once I get that part figured out, I can probably figure out the actual rule coding for it.p  pThank you.p

Negative 78757 pIm creating an PHP app that allows the user to search for files using Solr to power the search. This is mainly because the app requires content searching of Word Docs and PDFs. The app also uses a MySql database to keep track of the files.p  pIm thinking the best way to intially index all of the files probably around 20,000 is to write a PHP script that loops through all the files in a particular directory adding each one to the Solr index and creating a record for it in my database.p  pThe problem is the files themselves dont contain all of the data that needs to be indexed. Once the file name, content, author etc has been indexed using Solr Cell I need users of the app to be able to add extra meta data such as tags and categories.p  pI understand that if the users were to add this data to the MySql database I couldnt then update Solr with the extra data without overwriting the data that was already indexed content etc...p  pSo my question is once a file has been indexed by Solr how can I add extra meta data to the index that couldnt be retrieved from the file itself by the Solr Cell extractorp

Negative 78757 pI created a project using the master detail application template. The project is targeted for both iphone and iPad. p  pMy Master View contains a table view controller that is populated from DB data. No problems so far.p  pIn the detail view I replaced the default view controller with a Collection view controller.

Negative 78757 pI want to create a computed column in SAS enterprise guide where itll show car items if it meets certain conditions. There are 75 car items T.TSItems such as windscreen, tyres, steering wheel etc. Each item has a unique ID T.TSNUM so T.TSNUM 1 to T.TSNUM 75. And I want to then give each new car item a label such as labelNo01 to labelNo75. So if the vehicle type is Honda T.TSFNUM  2, type is Japanese T.TSTYPE  I and  T.TSNUM 1 then the new column name is LabelName01  with a item  such as windscreen. And if the vehicle type is Toyota T.TSFNUM  1 but the rest is the same it will give me the 75 car item for Toyota.p  pThe above is very simple and works but I am not sure how to add an Else statement if the vehicle type is Toyota T.TSFNUM  1p  pAlso a loop would help so I dont have to repeat the process for each vehicle type. Hope this information helps.p

Negative 78757 pIn my project I use an enum in some entities. The enum is to be stored in the database as an integer. To achieve this I use EclipseLinks a hrefhttpwww.eclipse.orgeclipselinkapi2.4orgeclipsepersistenceannotationsObjectTypeConverter.html relnofollowObjectTypeConvertera.p  pId like to use annotations since I use Spring to omit the persistence.xml. The annotation to configure the codeObjectTypeConvertercode must be specified on an entity. I dont feel the need to specify the annotation on all classes that use this enum as this is redundant and not maintainable. Specifying it once on some entity would work but this doesnt make sense in an OOP design or any design for that mater. A solution would be to annotate the enum with codeObjectTypeConvertercode, but this doesnt work since the enum isnt an entity.p  pExample that isnt working but would be idealp  precodeEntity public class ExampleEntity      Id     private Long id     Convertexampleenum     private ExampleEnum ee   ObjectTypeConvertername  exampleenum, objectType  ExampleEnum.class, dataType  Integer.class,     conversionValues                       ConversionValueobjectValue  A, dataValue  100,             ConversionValueobjectValue  B, dataValue  200,             ConversionValueobjectValue  C, dataValue  300          public enum ExampleEnum      A, B, C  codepre  pExample results in the following exceptionp  blockquote   pException Description The converter with name [exampleenum] used with the element [field ee] in the class [class com.example.ExampleEntity] was not found within the persistence unit.

Negative 78757 pI consider myself a well trained WordPress template developer, and i recently started to read books and documents about web app frameworks, particularly Django and Ruby on Rails. I didnt know any of the two languages, but i have no problems to learn another one or two. I really dont get the real benefits of using a framework, because i feel very confident about the power of WordPress. So, can anyone tell me the real benefits of using a framework For example, Pinterest is made using Django, but i think that i can achieve the same results with a WordPress template using Javascript and CSS3. Can anyone tell me the differencesbenefits of using a framework in that particular case  Thanksp

Negative 78757 pWe are developing an app that utilises a data grid. Most of the grids functionality will be fairly standard stuff  styling cells, incell editing, sorting, etc. However one requirement is to provide drag and fill functionality, like Excel. This is where you select one or more cells inside a row, which then get a thick border drawn around them. The border has a small square on its bottomright corner, and when you drag this down Excel copies the selected cell values to the rows below.p  pThis sounds like a frightening thing to try and implement using the .Net WPF data grid and no commercial data grid component provides this feature either.

Negative 78757 pI need some advice on some OpenCL code. Im coding a particle system in OpenCL, drawn directly onto the gpu from OpenCL, so no copying to the CPU. It all works really well, but i have problem creating new particles. p  pIve allocated one large memory area with all the particle data in it on the GPU. One of the parameters of a particle is called isAlive, and decides weather its active. When i want to create a new particle i then find a particle that isnt alive, modifies its position to its starting position before setting it to isAlive true. This process is very expensive since i have to iterate through all particles to find the ones that arent active, and at the same time i have to make sure that several threads do not create the same particle at the same time so i dont end up with more particles then i asked.  Are there any good considerations, algorithms or tactics to solve this problem more elegantly and faster p
Negative 78757 pI have created iOS module in Titanium. This module includes my own framework written in native objective c. Everything looks fine, but there is one issue. One of the methods ive ported from my framework through module, takes a UIView and adds to it another uiview as a subview. This subview contains a UIView with a UIButton. Problem is that sometimes subview appeares on the screen but without label on the button, i have to click the button, then the label appeares. But in some situations it depends when i call this method from the module in javascript, subview doesnt appeare at all, but it is actually there because when i tap on the place where it should be, buttons click event handler is being called. I have no idea what is wrong maybe something with layer. When i use my framework in a native ios app, everything is working fine.p  pCould someone help me with thatp

Negative 78757 pI would like to convert from a go [][]byte to a C char. In other words, I have a byte matrix in go that I would like to convert to a char double pointer in C.p  pPlease assume that I HAVE to have a [][]byte as input and a char as output.p  pI know it is possible to convert from []byte to char by doing something likep  precodeC.charunsafe.Pointerampdata[0] codepre  pBut it does not seem possible to extend this case into the second dimension. I have tried something pretty elaborate, where I pack a [][]byte into a new []byte. I then send that []byte to a C function that creates a char using pointer arithmetic to point into the new []byte at the correct locations.p  pThis conversion is giving me strange behaviour though, where my data would be correct for a few iterations, but gets corrupted seemingly between function calls.p  pIf anyone has any ideas, I would really appreciate it.p  pFrom the responses I see it is also important to state that Im working with raw data and not strings. Hence the go byte type. The original data would, therefore, be corrupted if C string terminators are added. Im just using C char, because a char is one byte in size. That said, thanks for the responses. I was able to adapt the accepted answer for my needs.p

Negative 78757 pIm new to Python and web technologies, I am currently building a web service that uses bottle framework. But I found out that the requests to my server actually interfere with each other, i.e when multiple requests are running concurrently, they all get significantly slow. After rounds of searching, it turned out to me that bottle actually has other server options such as tornado to handle concurrent connections when the load increases a hrefhttpbottlepy.orgdocsdevdeployment.htmlserveroptions relnofollowhttpbottlepy.orgdocsdevdeployment.htmlserveroptionsap  pBut the documentation does mention much about the actual implementation. So my question is, how to handle concurrent connections using bottle in conjunction with Tornado Any degree of help would be much appreciated.p  pThanks in advance, Ericp

Negative 78757 pI have just started working with MVVMCross for a cross platform app and I am having a hard time figuring out how to test my ViewModels. I tried following the testing done in TwitterSearch and ran into problems. Specifically in the MockSetup.cs I found that in the latest version of MvvmCross there no longer seems to be a codeIMvxViewDispatcherProvidercode but that is ok because I emthinkem its functionality has been rolled up into the codeIMvxViewDispatchercode. However, when actually setting up the dipatcher for my test cases there is no codeRequestNavigatecode method for the dispatcher anymore and I can not find an implementation of codeMvxShowViewModelRequestcode. So I can not actually get any tests for my ViewModels to work. p  pbr I also tried to follow the testing here a hrefhttpslodge.blogspot.com201210testingviewmodelsinmvvmcross.html relnofollowhttpslodge.blogspot.com201210testingviewmodelsinmvvmcross.htmla but again ran into issues with missing codeMvxOpenNetCfServiceProviderSetupcode.p  pSo in summary, my issue has been getting a MockSetup working so that I can test my ViewModels. If I could just be pointed in the right direction on the dispatcher, I think that would help.p

Negative 78757 pWe have an application with StartPage.xaml, where control template for TabControl defines some grids and stack panels. There is an itemPresenter in that template in the middle of the xaml, and a stack panel below it. While it works fine for a user, MS UI automation can see only tab items inside the item presenter, and nothing else that is defined on the same level in the template. I tried to add standard button inside a stack panel which can not be seen by MS UIA to check if that is a problem related to custom user controls we have, but that standard button is also not visible for MS UIA. If I use Snoop, I can see all the elements from the template in a snoops tree on the corresponding levels of template hierarchy. But MS UIA still cant find them.p  pWhat can go wrong here with controls that will prevent MS UIA from finding them on a pagep

Negative 78757 pI have in mind a scenario where a Windows 8 app will act as a server, receiving messages from diverse clients other Windows 8 apps or Excel Web Apps. Those messages need to arrive at a low latency lt1s in most cases. I am considering many different solutions.

The source will send messages to Azure and Azure will send them as a push  notification to the appropriate server device. The problem is that latency here is not very good.pli lipAzure Mobile Services or something simpler like a simple Web API site only for matchmaking actual sending of messages would be established with each client having a web socket connection to the server app. Here we have very low latency, but I fear connectivity problems. The fact that the server wont store any messages is better from a data protection perspective, but makes disasterrecovery and handling moments where the server app will be on the background slightly more difficult.pli lipAzure Service Bus. Its supposed to be made for that the server subscribes to the feed of client messages, but I think a new queue will need to be created for each server and then clients will have to learn of the name of that queue, so some matchmaking like in option 2 will be necessarypli ol  pWhat would you recommendp  pThanks in advancep

Negative 78757 pI have an ImageZoom class that subclasses UIView and is a delgate for the UIScrollView.  Its pretty straight forward. The class contains a UIScrollView which contains a UIImageView.

Negative 78757 pI am new to iOS programming, so I hope anyone of you can help me with this problem p  pThe iOS app I am working at enables the user to take photos and save the image with custom metadata dateamptime, latitude,longtitude etcto the device.  Only the camera function taking photos and save it is working by now and I am trying to save the exifdata gps,date and time to the image. But the reason why I am writing this thread is, because I have no idea how to assign the direction of the camera and the position of the user in a room to the imagep  pSo to get a better understanding of my problem, imagine that you are standing in a room and you want to take pictures of all items in this room. Lets say the room usually has 4 walls, so everytime you take a picture of a wall, you have to save your position in the room, where youre taking the picture and your direction, because later it should be possible to say which wall you were facing and to mark your position on a floorplan for example. There already exists an app called strongSolocatorstrong, which provides the functions I need. But I want to implement these functions in my app and have to know the idea behind them p  pSo first of all I need to know the distance between my position and all four walls in the room or the distance to a corner point between to walls How With CLLocationDistancep  pI would really appreciate any ideas you might have  Thank youp

Negative 78757 pIm learning SQLite and C within the Qt framework.

Its a pretty simple database with some primary tables and some relational tables.p  pI think Ive got the basics down and early tests show that my record data is being stored but in writing the methods to manage the database it looks like I am going to end up with a great many methods, particularly when I start to add in searching, sorting, deleting, etc.p  pThis leads me to ask if I am going about this the correct way.

Negative 78757 pI am running into a problem while creating an app where the app is not being rendered at the correct size in iOS7 on an iPod Touch 5G. I have started with a blank View Based application using Flex 4.6 and AIR 3.9. The Home View is being automatically generated by the New Project Wizard, and no further setup is being done. I basically was just trying to get my work flow setup so that I could check into SVN, compile to the device, and deploy to TestFlight etc. when I noticed that the blank app was not displaying correctly. I have tested the app on an Android device as well and it fills the entire screen as it should with the same exact setup. I have also ran it on an older iPod Touch and it fills the screen, but I believe that may be because the screen resolution is lower on that device...not sure.p  pAnyways, I have added a link to a screen grab where you will be able to see a large black area at the top and the bottom of the screen. It seems like it is displaying at a lower resolution, or possibly locking to a certain aspect ratio. However, I would like it to fill the whole screen by default. It just seems like I have never had this issue before creating the same types of apps in iOS6 for the iPhone 5 for example...so Im not sure whats going on.p  pa hrefhttpwww.millerbrosinteractive.comdevscreengrab.png relnofollowReference Image  Screen Grabap  pI guess its also worth noting that when running locally using the simulator, the entire screen area is displayed as desired, and it does not render black area on the top and bottom of the app. The problem only exists when running the app on the actual device.p  pThanks in advance for any helpp

Negative 78757 pI have been investigating the way in which the html root element and the body child element interact in an HTML document. The following excerpt in the CSS 2.1 specification states that in the box model margins are transparent, which we all know.p  pa hrefhttpwww.w3.orgTRCSS21box.htmlmpbexamples relnofollowhttpwww.w3.orgTRCSS21box.htmlmpbexamplesap  blockquote   pThe margins of the LI boxes are transparent  margins are always   transparent  so the background color yellow of the UL padding and   content areas shines through them.p blockquote  pHowever, what has made me curious is, if margins are transparent, then if I give the root element, namely the html element, a margin, this margin should show through the default browser user agent canvas color. However, this is not the case as shown by the snippet below. The margin of the toplevel html element seems to make use of the same color as the one specified in its background property. Here is the codep  precodeltdoctype htmlgt lthtml stylemargin 40px border 1px solid black background greengt ltheadgt ltmeta charsetutf8gt lttitlegtTestlttitlegt ltstyle typetextcssgt   margin 0 border 0 padding 0  ltstylegt ltheadgt ltbody stylemargin 40px width 400px height 300px background pinkgt ltbodygt lthtmlgt codepre  pHere we can see the green margin pertaining to the html root element, containing the black border pertaining to the html root element, containing the green margin pertaining to the body element, containing the pink content pertaining to the body element.p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comsR4Jf.png altHTML element and BODY element interactionsp  pIs this behavior specified anywhere in the CSS 2.1 specification If so, then where I cant seem to find it anywhere.p  pThanks.p  hr  pstrongEDITstrongp  pAs BoltClock pointed out below, this behavior is mentioned in section 14.2 of the CSS 2.1 specification and is carried on to the CSS3 specs Background and Borders module. That is, unlike for other CSS elements, the background of the html element also covers the margins area.p  pHowever, as BoltClock also pointed out below, that section also specifies that it is considered more appropriate to set the background color on the body element rather than on the html element. Here is the relevant excerpt from the CSS 2.1 specp  blockquote   pFor HTML documents, however, we recommend that authors specify the   background for the BODY element rather than the HTML element. For   documents whose root element is an HTML HTML element or an XHTML   html element that has computed values of transparent for   backgroundcolor and none for backgroundimage, user agents must   instead use the computed value of the background properties from that   elements first HTML BODY element or XHTML body element child when   painting backgrounds for the canvas, and must not paint a background   for that child element. Such backgrounds must also be anchored at the   same point as they would be if they were painted only for the root   element.p blockquote  pSo let us try and see what happens if in our original HTML we comment out the background CSS property from the html elements style attribute as followsp  precodeltdoctype htmlgt lthtml stylemargin 40px border 1px solid black  background green gt ltheadgt ltmeta charsetutf8gt lttitlegtTestlttitlegt ltstyle typetextcssgt   margin 0 border 0 padding 0  ltstylegt ltheadgt ltbody stylemargin 40px width 400px height 300px background pinkgt ltbodygt lthtmlgt codepre  pHere is the resultp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comaJfuV.png altHTML element and BODY element interactionsp  pAs we can see, the pink background from the body element is propagated to the entire html elements box, thus covering the html elements margin, the html elements border which is not pink but black because for the html element the border we specified is solid and black, and the bodys margin element and the bodys content area which appear as a single pink area although we could assign a background to the body element and it would cover the content area of course.  p  pIn any case, this investigation has been carried out because of pure interest. For all practical purposes you normally wouldnt set anything for the html element and would just allow the rule   margin 0 border 0 padding 0  to be fall through to the html and body elements and apply a background on the body element or within a wrapper div contained within the body element.p  pRegards.p

Negative 78757 pThe not so new anymore C11 standard introduced the codeexterncode keyword for templates. Its purpose is to tell the compiler that a template should not be instantiated at the point of usage, but that it will be instantiated in another translation unit and thus there will be an instantiation available at link time  at least AFAIK.p  pNow, even in the preC11 era we used something similar to separate the declarationdefinition of template classes from its instantiation in order to speed up compilation, e.g. like sop  pstrongpoint.hstrong class definitionp  precodetemplate ltint dimgt struct Point    ...   void foo   ...  codepre  pstrongpoint.cppstrong method definitionsp  precodeinclude point.h template ltint dimgt void Pointltdimgtfoo    ...  codepre  pstrongpoint2d.cppstrong class instantiation 2D versionp  precodeinclude point.cpp template struct Pointlt2gt codepre  pstrongpoint3d.cppstrong class instantiation 3D versionp  precodeinclude point.cpp template struct Pointlt3gt codepre  pstrongmain.cppstrong usage of 2D and 3D pointsp  precodeinclude point.h int mainint, char      Pointlt2gt p     p.foo  codepre  pNow I am wonderingp  ul liIs our approach valid C 03 or 11 code or are we just lucky it workedli liWith C11, would we be able to achieve the same thing by including codepoint.cppcode in codemain.cppcode and declaring codeextern template ltint dimgt struct Pointcodeli ul

Negative 78757 pI have an MVC site that uses authentication and authorization successfully. I am trying to query an api portion of the site using jquery and the load method. I have attempted to then usep  precodeUser.Identity.GetUserId codepre  pand this fails, as the request is not authenticated. The page with the ajax request is sucessfully logged in. Is it possible to access its authentication token and pass this with the load request, or do I need to generate a new token in javascriptp  pEDIT After some more research, I have found that this line in the WebApiConfig filep  precodeconfig.SuppressDefaultHostAuthentication codepre  pIs what is disabling the cookie validation for ajax requests. It makes it so only the token method is evaluated. By default MVC uses cookies, and web api uses tokens. I was trying to utilise two different authentication schemes. As the cookie is sent automatically with the ajax requests, the User.Identity is then filled. This answers my original question.p  pHowever, this is considered insecure and allows for CRSF attacks. Therefore, token is desirable.p  pSo, reworded, strongcan you use an existing authentication cookie with the token endpoint to generate an authentication tokenstrongp

Negative 78757 pIm currently trying to add infinite scrolling to a codeUITableViewcode, which contains a number of calendar events. Since the event title doesnt always fit inside a single line Ive added a multiline codeUILabelcode to the cell. In order to calculate the height of the cell Im taking advantage of codeUITableViewcodes new selfsizing cells via Auto Layout in iOS 8. WWDC Session 226 talks about this in more detail.p  pIn order to implement the infinite scrolling mechanism Im overriding codelayoutSubviewscode where I need to calculate the height of a section which at the time given ist not visible on screen. This can be done by using code[self rectForSection0]code. When doing so the table returns a height based on the estimated row size I had to define inside the tables initialiser in order to make selfsizing cells work.p  precodeself.estimatedRowHeight  44.0 self.rowHeight  UITableViewAutomaticDimension codepre  pWhen the section gets on screen I get the correct size of the section, but since I have to update the tables contentOffset based on the computed height of that specific section this causes my table to jump up and down.p  pAny ideas on how to solve this Is there a way to force a section to return the actual height and not the estimated onep

Further requests for that video then receive a 304 response from blob storage.p  pHowever, when you request the video through the Azure CDN, it helpfully returns it to you as a series of HTTP 206 partial responses.

Negative 78757 pOkay, my code is huge but I will simplify it so you can get it fast. So generaly my code algorithm is  br br1. Reading bitmap from SD card which is a face image. br2. Reading one object from SD card for each read photo and deserializing it object contains coordinates of face regions such as eyes, nose, mouth etc. br3. Processing image and getting some data from it. br4. Writting data to .txt files on SD card.p  pThere is a method that is using a recurency presented below. I enter list which contains photos paths as argument. Then for each photo I deserialize object from SD card. After success call  I enter dezerialized object to processPhoto method with other parameters. After processPhoto finish processing it calls interface onPhotoProcessFinished. Interface increments imageProcessed and invokes processNextImageIfPossible again. Process repeats until all photos are processed. It works, but after like 50 iterations I get error.

Negative 78757 pI have been working in trying to find a solution to cross side scripting for AJAX requestp  pSo this is how the flow isp  p1 A screen has a text box where we are using a RichEditorp  p2 In the text box you can click Edit Button which shows displays a new panelp  p3 Once you click, the new panel is open, and in the new panel you can Edit the text and Update it.p  p4 In the new panel there is a Continue Button, if you click on it will update the text in the backing bean, close the new panel, and refresh the text area in the original panel.p  pWhen continue is clicked, onComplete, they hide the new panel or current panel and rerender the original panelThere is an AJAX request for this. So while we send that request, our security team uses Paros Tool to insert malicious scripts alertXSS attack on it. Since it is an AJAX request and it goes through an AJAX Engine to get a response, I have not been able to figure out how to filter or make sure the scripts would not run if is bad script.p  pPossibly, a Javascript needs to be run right after an AJAX response, but I am not sure how to do that.

One of the reason why I need helpp  pMost importantly our payroll runs from the 11th of the month to the 10th of the next month and thats what the above SQL code does. It looks for all pay values from the 11th to the 10th and sums it as a total. It also gives me the values for the previous month 11072014 to 10082014. The output view looks something like thisp  prePeriodStart    total 20140711     180       Previous month 20140811     45        This monthpre  pPrevious month being 11072014  10082014 This month being 11082014  10092014p  pWhat I need is for the above code to be rewritten to give me 4 separate variables. As an example  the variable names could be  previousmonth, ptotal, thismonth, ttotal these 4 variables can then be used in my classic asp coding.p  pIf its easier splitting the above SQL Statement into 2 separate statements this will be ok.p  pIm trying to get away from using an array in my Classic ASP code as this is throwing errors when I have a new user. I would also find it easier to play with variables than I would with an array.p

Negative 78757 pIm having some issues trying to figure out how to scroll the content of a grid which is contained inside of a scroll viewer. When trying to scroll with the mouse wheel or pan with a touch screen, the grid scrolls fine if the mousetouch point is over an empty area, but if it is above certain controls ex. a group box it wont scroll.

Negative 78757 pI am developing a project in a team. I am using XCode 6 beta 7 but other members are using XCode 5.1p  pWe can all open and run the same project in both the versions of XCode  5.1 and 6 beta 7 .p  pOn eof my project mates who is working on XCode 5.1 has some integer variables in his code that he is initializing as nil. The code compiles properly in his XCode 5.1 properly and runs fine. However when I run the same code in XCode 6 beta 7, I get a semantic issue when compiling the code.p  pExact error message   Semantic Issue Assigning to NSInteger aka long from incompatible type nullptrt .p  pIf I iniialize those variables with zero, the code compiles and runs fine.p  pI discussed this with an expert and he said that they should remain as nil instead of zero cuz if we iniialize them with zero, the values remain in memory and that might create a memory hog in the future.p  pWhat should I do, how should I solve this problem. I cannot compile the code unless I change their code and iniialize those integer variables as zero instead nil....p  pI dont want to downgrade my version of XCode from 6 to 5.1p  pPlease help p  pThanks,p  pUjjwalp

Negative 78757 pSo I have a bit of a mindboggler on my hands thats refusing to bend. My objective is to log on a database every single time a page is visited. I have created on the c side code that logs this info and I know it works. What Im trying to do now is relatively straightfoward every time an item that is, a page is clicked on the home view list which acts as a shell for the SPA and doesnt change, send the page name to a function in Javascript which will in turn communicate to the Webmethod. The problem is, when the app starts, as it is a SPA, it collects all the divs see below and renders them and for some reason, it does not want to communicate and pass parameters into the javascript function, no matter where I put it Ive put it on a header, Ive put it underneath the html, etc. The onclick function works fine when test it separately, but in this application, it refuses to work.p  pIve also tried using body onloadPostName as well as window.onload on each of the pages to invoke the function but its also a blank.

Negative 78757 pI was wondering if it is possible to have multiple conditions in a .change function.p  pFor example, these are the two first lines of my .js filep  precodedocument.readyfunction      select[namestreettype].changefunction   codepre  pThis is for a page that deals with house values and such. I have a form where a user enters their address and streettype is a selection list of rd, st, Ave, etc.p  pSay they select st. Doing so will disable and enable some other options in the form.p  pThen as they continue filling out the form, there is another selection list.  And they select 2 storey. Doing this emshouldem also enable and disable some other options and print some messages.p  pHowever, since the function only changes when streettype changes, selecting 2 storey wont chaneg anything. Instead, the user will have to have 2 storey selected, then go back and change streettype to something else e.g. rd then back to st for it to change the other values further in the form.p  pSo I am wondering if it is possible to have multiple conditions for change.p  pThank youp

I am therefore assuming that I am not handling the JMS listener clean up part of the application properlyp  pHere is the stack I am usingp  precodeJava 8 Tomcat 7.0.55 Spring Integration 4.0.4 Spring Integration Java Dsl 1.0.0.M3 codepre  pIn terms of my SI applications configurations, I have a JmsConfig classp  precodeConfiguration ComponentScan public class JmsConfig       Autowired     private Properties jndiProperties      private ConnectionFactory mqConnectionFactory throws NamingException           Context ctx  new InitialContextjndiProperties          try              MQQueueConnectionFactory connectionFactory  MQQueueConnectionFactory                 ctx.lookupjmsserviceSERVICEQCF              return connectionFactory           finally              ctx.close                       Bean     public ConnectionFactory cachingConnectionFactory throws NamingException          CachingConnectionFactory connectionFactory  new CachingConnectionFactory         connectionFactory.setTargetConnectionFactorymqConnectionFactory         connectionFactory.setSessionCacheSize10         return connectionFactory       codepre  pI have an Integration config classp  precodeConfiguration EnableIntegration public class IntegrationConfig       Autowired     private ConnectionFactory cachingConnectionFactory      Bean     public IntegrationFlow requestFlow           return IntegrationFlows             .fromJms.inboundAdaptercachingConnectionFactory.destination                     SERVICEQUEUENAME, c gt                  c.pollerPollers.fixedRate100                          .channelrequest.service.ch.get       codepre  pWeb Initialiser config classp  precodeConfiguration public class WebInitialiser implements WebApplicationInitializer       public void onStartupServletContext servletContext             throws ServletException          AnnotationConfigWebApplicationContext rootContext                   new AnnotationConfigWebApplicationContext         rootContext.registerApplicationConfig.class, JmsConfig.class,             IntegrationConfig.class, DatabaseConfig.class          servletContext.addListenernew ContextLoaderListenerrootContext       codepre  pDuring the undeploy stage I see the following in the catalina logs which may or may not be relatedp  precodeSEVERE The web application [servicea] appears to have started a thread named [Thread7] but has failed to stop it.

Negative 78757 pI have just discovered interesting thing.  In BizTalk MSMQ send adapter you can set up Logon Info by providing User Name and Password to access the remote queue. But these properties User Name and Password do not exist in adapter class. I.e. when you construct message to be sent in orchestration you set up adapter properties, like this deliveryMsgMSMQ.BodyType  30 So there is no such things as User Name or Password properties in MSMQ adapter. This means you cannot specify a user you want to use for MSMQ dynamic port. Has anyone ever come across this issue I cant beleive Microsoft did not include these properties by mistake. Any solution for thatp  pThank you Jimmyp

I could just use that number in my constraints, but it seems somewhat random.

If I set a negative codetransitiondelaycode the transition occurrs sort of.  But it occurrs in the following way  Very quickly the backgroundcolor and color begin to animate, and finish, and at some point later about the same as it has been the box shadow comes in.  But here is the weird thing  there is a very small window where that works something like a .2s difference, so if the duration is code.5scode, and I set the transitiondelay to code.4scode, I will see a transition somewhat normally as described above.  When dealing with 100ms transitions, the effect is obviously subtle but its still noticable.  However, if I set the duration to code.5scode and I set the delay to code.1scode, the transition will still have that noticable visual delay.  p

Negative 78757 pNote Giving the background of my previous question once again so as to find all the related stuff at one source. p  pIm capturing an image from an android mobile device and its in JPEG format. The image is of 72X72DPI and 24 bit. When I try to convert this JPEG image to TIFF using LibTiff.Net and to set the tag Photometric Interpretation  0 for MinIsWhite, the image turns negative the white becomes black and black becomes white. The environment is Windows 8.1 64 bit, Visual Studio 2012. The tag must have value 0, where 0  white is zero. p  pI absolutely must use Photometric.MINISWHITE in images so tried inverting image data before writing it to TIFF as per the below code. But then the compression changes to LZW instead of CCITT4,Photometric is changed to MINISBLACK from MINISWHITE, FIllorder tag is removed, PlanarConfig tag is removed, New tag Predictor is added with value 1 and the image turns negative again.p  precodepublic partial class Form1  Form              private const TiffTag TIFFTAGASCIITAG  TiffTag666         private const TiffTag TIFFTAGLONGTAG

Negative 78757 pWhen I try to purchase more than one subscription I get the following error message which is finep  pA subscription has been removed from your cart. Multiple subscriptions can not be purchased at the same time.p  pThe problem is that the error message appears on the product page and does not redirect to the cart page. This is confusing to the customer because it removed the original subscription from the cart and put the new one in but they land back on the product page and add a new subscription all over again.p  pAlso in my case I added a hook to go directly to checkout when the subscription is added to cart, as I only sell subscriptions I dont need a cart and rather go directly to checkout. Additionally if I link directly to the purchase from another page different than the produc page and the user already had a subscription in the cart I get a blank page shows theme header, etc but no content.p  pI want it to redirect to the cart page or checkout in my case following the error message. But this is not happening. What should I change to make the errors appear but in the checkout I dont care actually if no errors are showed at all but goes to checkout.p  pThank you everybody for your timep
Negative 78757 pI am using visualsearch JS for filtering records from a table. Table contains record having different filters like country, category etc. p  pNow when I select country for ex. DE Germany. Filter works perfect, it returns all records of DE. After that when I select category for ex. fee. It returns results combining both filters. Means all the records of DE  all the records of fee. What I want is having all the fee type records in country DE. That is intersection of two filters. I have searched a lot but didnt find anything.p  pOK, I think it is not the issue of Visual search JS. May be it is beacuse datatables. Because visual search just passes the requested terms to the datatable filtering method. This is the method of data table that filters the records.p  precode  .fn.dataTableExt.afnFiltering.pushfunctionoSettings, aData, iDataIndex     var flag  false    if  typeof visualSearch[cardId]  undefined      if arrSearchTexts[cardId].length  0           flag  true                  Filter Texts        if arrSearchTexts[cardId].length gt 0           var iCategory  aData[transCategoryColumnNo]      aData[transCategoryColumnNo]          var iCountry  aData[countryColumnNo]      aData[countryColumnNo]           .eacharrSearchTexts[cardId],functioni             var currentTerm  arrSearchTexts[cardId][i].toUpperCase            var posCategory  iCategory.toUpperCase.indexOfcurrentTerm            var posCountry  iCountry.toUpperCase.indexOfcurrentTerm            if posCategory gt 0  posCountry gt 0               flag  true                                        codepre  pHere, aData contains all the records of datatable, so every time wheneever there is a match it will mark flag as true and will return it. So if this function returns true, data table displays the relative record. p  pSo, What I want is some kind of logic to filter aData itself. If it is possible.p

Negative 78757 pWhen Im on SO I read a lot of comments guiding Especially in C p  pdynamic allocation allways goes to the heap, automatic allocation on the stackp  pBut especially regarding to plain C I disaggree with that. As the ISOIEC9899 doesnt even drop a word of heap or stack. It just mentions three storage duriations static, automatic, and allocated and advises how each of them has to be treat.p  pWhat would give a compiler the option to do it even wise versa if it would like to.p  pSo my question isp  pAre the heap and the stack physical existing that even if not in C a standardized language can say ... has to happen on heap and ... on the stackp  pOr are they just a virtuell system of managing memory access so that a language cant make rules about them, as it cant even be ensured the enviroment supports themp  pIn my knowledgebase only the second would make sense. But I read allready many times people writing comments like In language XY this WILL happen on the stackheap. But if Im right this had to be indeterminable as long the language isnt just made for such systems which guarantee to have a stack and heap. And all thoose comments would be wrong.p  pThats what lead me to ask about this question. Am I that wrong, or is there a big error in reasoning going around about thatp

Negative 78757 pRelatively new to working with .net but learning a lot while working with a developer at work who at times can be stubborn. Recently the asp.net web form we are developing has periodically started crashing such that every time a link is clicked that retrieves an object an in process form that the user had previously filled out the user gets the following application error Sequence contains more than one element.p  pAll the sources I looked at online suggested that this was an InvalidOperationException thrown by the Single method and could be avoided by a eliminating the source of duplicate elements or b using the First method instead of the Single method.p  pThe developer told me that I had no idea what I was talking about and that this was a caching error that could only be solved via an IIS reset. Since this has been happening periodically Im a bit concerned that doing the IIS reset doesnt address the underlying issue that creates the exception.

Negative 78757 pIm trying to debug a Fortran 95 program using gdb 4.8. When I encounter a breakpoint or the error Im trying to debug, I cannot print any information on local variables using the codeinfocode command. I also get a codeNo symbol tape information availablecode error when running codebt fullcode.p  pI dont believe this is related to the version of gdb as I first tried installing the version from Homebrew and got the same error. I then removed the Homebrew installation and compiled and installed the latest available version of gdb from source. My Fortran file is compiled with the codegcode flag and the codefbacktracecode flag and has no explicit optimization flag, but I have attempted to compile with codeO0code, codeO1code, codeO2code, and codeO0code. All give the same error.p  pPossibly related is the fact that, upon running the code, I get loads of warnings.

Negative 78757 pI have a 6x6 bingo card which is generated with random numbers between 10 and 70. The 7th row and 7th column are used to count the drawn numbers that are on the card. When a row or column reaches 6, there is bingo.p  pThe eventual result I get is right, but in the proces of getting there a few things are going wrong.p  pIn my function generateCard I create the rows and columns of numbers for the card. I think the problem lies in this function.p  precodefunction generateCard   card  array      for row  1 row lt 8 row               card[row]  array          deck  array0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9          for kolom  1 kolom lt 8 kolom               index  mtrand0,countdeck  1             number  deck[index]             card[row][]  row . number             unsetdeck[index]             deck  arrayvaluesdeck                   Test         printCardcard           7th column         card[row][7]  0          Test     printCardcard       7th row     for kolom  1 kolom lt 7 kolom         card[7][kolom]  0       Test printCardcard return card  codepre  pIve put in a few printCard functions to test the outcome.p  pThe first test above the creation of the 7th column gives me a ton of undefined offset 7 notices. I figured this happens because the column does not exist, but when I try to create this earlier, I still get the notices.p  pThe second test above the 7th row shows that the 7th row which should be 0 gets filled with numbers. This gets overwritten after with 0 values. I figured I could fix this by putting row lt 7 and kolom lt 7, but when I do this the card wont get printed right at all.p  pIm wondering why im getting all these undefined offset notices about the last column even when I create it earlier and why I cant use row lt 7 and column lt 7 in both the for loops of generate card to avoid filling up the last row  and column 7x7 with values. These should be 0 before the bingo game starts.p  pDo you have any suggestionsp  pI think im overlooking a few things here..

Negative 78757 pI am currently working on a PHP application prerelease. p  pstrongBackgroundstrongp  pWe have the a table in our MySQL database which is expected to grow extremely large  it would not be unusual for a single user to own 250,000 rows in this table. Each row in the table is given an amount and a date, among other things.p  pFurthermore, this particular table is read from and written to very frequently  on the majority of pages. Given that each row has a date, Im using codeGROUP BY datecode to minimise the size of the resultset given by MySQL  rows contained in the same year can now be seen as just one total.p  pHowever, a typical page will still have a resultset between 10003000 results. There are also places where many codeSUMcodes are performed, totalling many tens  if not hundreds  of thousands of rows.p  pstrongTrying MySQLstrongp  pOn a usual page, MySQL was usually taking around around 600900ms. Using codeLIMITcode and offsets werent helping performance and the data has been heavily normalised, and so it doesnt seem like further normalisation would help.p  pTo make matters worse, there are parts of the application which require the retrieval of 10,00015,000 rows from the database. The results are then used in a calculation by PHP and formatted accordingly. Given this, the performance of MySQL wasnt acceptable. p  pstrongTrying MongoDBstrongp  pI have converted the table to MongoDB, and its speed is faster  it usually takes around 250ms to retrieve 2,000 documents. However, the codegroupcode command in the aggregation pipeline  needed to aggregate fields depending on the year they fall in  slows things down. Unfortunately, keeping a total and updating that whenever a document is removedupdatedinserted is also out of the question, because although we can use a yearly total for some parts of the app, in other parts the calculations require that each amount falls on a specific date.p  pIve also considered Redis, although I think the complexity of the data is beyond what Redis was designed for.p  pstrongThe Final Strawstrongp  pOn top of all of this, speed is important. So performance is up there it terms of priorities.p  pstrongQuestionsstrongp  ol liWhat is the best way to store data which is frequently readwritten and rapidly growing, with the knowledge that most queries will retrieve a very large resultsetli liIs there another solution to the problem Im totally open to suggestions.li ol  pIm a little stuck at the moment, I havent been able to retrieve such a large resultset in an acceptable amount of time. It seems most datastores are great for small retrieval sizes  even on large amounts of data  but I havent been able to find anything on retrieving large amounts of data from an even larger tablecollection.p

Negative 78757 pWere using Spring security thats initialized using a codeAbstractSecurityWebApplicationInitializercode.

Negative 78757 pI dont even know if this is possible because I cant find anything anywhere about it but are you able to specify the groups that are added to the Local Administrators group during a domain join like in addition to Domain Admins. I know I can do it with group policy but sometimes that isnt fast enough, right after a domain join the second group isnt always added which forces the techs to have to log in locally with admin rights and specify their domain account to connect to a network share in order to install software required by that PC. p

Negative 78757 pI am aware that you should make a child theme and copy the files you make changes to into the child theme folder so you know what has changed and so your changes dont get overridden, but I am confused about that. Why not just copy all the files from the parent theme into the child theme folder and make changes like that I tried just copying the files I made changes to and making a child CSS file for just the changes but then the parent theme updated.p  pWhen this happened my changes were still there but everything else that I didnt change was updated and now the color scheme, background and font are all different. I have since went back to the old parent theme and fixed the issues but I wanted to know what is the right way to do this Am I missing out on important updates if I dont update the parent theme Any advice is appreciated.p

Negative 78757 pI am building a simple top down rougelike game using unity. I have development experience, but am a beginner to both unity framework and c. Is there a clean and graceful way of handling player object interactions with other various types of objects in the scene p  pFor example, the scene would be full of walls, enemies and other objects that block the path and the player can interact with by attempting to move in their direction. Standing near a chest and moving in its direction would not move the player, but open the chest. If moving into a wall, it would damage it, etc. p  pAt the moment im using raycast2d to get hold of the object blocking the path, but cant find a solution of how to interact with it without having to check what type of object it is is a Wall is a Chest etc... I made an interface which all interactable objects implement with a method interact, but different types of objects require different information. A wall would require the amount of damage it should take depends on player stats which are in the player class, chest would take none. Therefore its difficult for all of them to implement the same interface. Having the wall ask the player whats his damage is also poor programming practice. p  pIve found a similar question on this posted a while ago a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions11323413handlinginteractionbetweenobjectson stackowerflowa. It suggests using an observer pattern, but I cant imagine every single object on the scene being subscribed to player movement event and after each move checking weather it was hit or not. p  pIs there a standard solution to this kind of interaction One which would be loosely coupled, clean and follow good programming practicesp
Negative 78757 pI have a long loop where neon vector additions are performed on 8 bit elements. The problem is that after a while it is almost sure that some or all the vector components are saturated because of overflow.

Negative 78757 pI am looking for open source shopping cart solutions which provides the following two features together  multi seller support and contact a seller.p  pAmazon, Ebay etc provides such features. Flipkart does not. This is like an internal inbox inside the shopping cart portal. The buyer can also attach documents, images with his message to the seller. The message is usually something regarding the product the buyer just purchased from the seller.p  pOpencart has something called sms to vendor, which doesnt seem to serve the purpose. Magento might have something similar, but I am unable to find much information about the same.p  pGuys, your helpful input on this issue would be valued. Thanks in advancep
