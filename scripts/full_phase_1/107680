Positive 107680 pI would like to create a server using either php or javascript for the implementation of a multiplayer gaming arena, which would allow users to connect and play games online over the internet. What game they play is not my concern, I just wish to build a server which can efficiently manage and allow the existence of an arena eg Garena or Steam.p  pIt doesnt have to be really complicated, the most simplest of implementation guideline would be thoroughly appreciated. I have been researching slowly for over a month now, but Ive had no solid understanding of even the most fundamental blocks needed to craft this piece of software. The hints I found, I have added them as tags.p
Positive 107680 pGood Morning and day to all I hope this makes sense. I was on here last week as I was missing one step to change my codeapp.jscode file to codeserver.jscode and got enough help to make it work. I am returning with an new issue that perhaps stem from that one.. Here is whats happening p  pI am working on a MEAN app and Ive been working as usual typing codemongodcode to have mongoDB running. and i was using codenpm startcode because it was advice to me but usually i use codenodemoncodep  pIve noticed that gradually my server just completely disconnects and I have to manually restart it by typing npm start again. The connection last about 1 minute before it loses it. However now it doesnt connect at all. I think it has something to do with losing connection to MongoDB because I have a codeconsole.logcode for whenever I dont have mongoDB running to remind me.. and this is the console log that my server spits outp  pstrongserver.jsstrongp  precoderequirenet.connect27017, locahost.onerror, function console.logHes name is MongoDB live from port 27017  process.exit0   codepre  pI tried switching back to running it with codenodemoncode while it gives me the impression that its connected as it doesnt spit out any errors when I update any part of my code or refresh the page, it just spits out the console.log message that I showed above and I have to exit and restart..with codenpm run develcode I have no luck either. this is not happening in other applicationsp  pHere is a look at my command line with all 3 attempts to connect to the server and notice how it spits out the codeconsole.logcode message.. I refresh my page and it doesnt connect at all anymore. It used to as I mentioned before but for a minute or so. I hope someone can help me out and point me in the right direction.p  pusing codenpm startcode, codenpm run develcode and codenodemoncodep  pa hrefhttpi.stack.imgur.com9Y40Z.png relnofollowimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.com9Y40Z.png altmy terminal starting servera p  pPackage.JSON file p  pa hrefhttpi.stack.imgur.comTgjcX.png relnofollowimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comTgjcX.png altenter image description hereap

Positive 107680 pI would like to create an app that talks to the users computer so Id like to create a server with a REST API. What is the best way to go about doing this I looked into WCF but that seems overkill and most tutorials I see seems its more suitable to a server backend than being installed on a user computer. p  pAre there other more suitable frameworks in C that I can use to create a REST API on all user machines as opposed to using socketsp  pThanksp  pEdit Apologies for the lack of clarity. I would like to develop an app on iOS and Android that talks to the users machine. In order to do this, I need a server on the users machine that will perform the actions that I request from the mobile device. I want to avoid using sockets as a REST API will suffice and makes development easier. I believe WCF can achieve this but might be overkill for a simple app that talks to a users machine. Web API seeems like something that would be the solution but happy to hear if Im taking a wrong approach to this.p

Positive 107680 pThis seems to be a common issue but I havent found a solution that actually works. Ive tried installing both Lithium and Helium on Ubuntu using the Installation Guide from the wiki. Following this guide the only feature that gets installed is odll2switchswitchui which should also install the DLUX Web Interface. I can access it fine using http8181index.html but I get the Unable to Login error when i try to log in using admin  admin. Ive tried the various fixes that include installing several features in the correct order. And Ive deleted the data directory, then reinstalled the features, but I cannot get it to log in. I am installing on Ubuntu Server, not on Ubuntu Desktop. It seems unlikely that thats causing the issue but its worth noting.p

The output is something like thisp  pcodeTYP     HSTNAME CLDB    ZKPR    NFS     WBSVR   FLSVR   JBT     TSKT    HBMcodep  pcodeData    server1  1       0       1       0       1       0       1       0codep  pSo, yes, it is a table that xamp program will take to validate if the server has or hasnt the specified service at the top of this table. But do you know if it is possible with a GUI builded with xamp, to launch a script located on a Linux server. I imagine is something preaty much as Npgsql for postgress but I dont know for sure.p

Positive 107680 pIm developing some multiuser application. In this application multiple users can access and edit data. For the frontand webapp I use AngularJS.p  pI am facing some architectural problem.p  pLets say, there is some data1. This data1 should be accessible for many users view only, but only one user should have the possibility to edit this data1.p  pIf the data1 is marked as inEdit, the other users can only view the last saved version of the data1.p  pNow, I am not quite sure, how to implement this feature.p  pAs for me, there are two ways of doing that.p  pstrongFIRSTstrong Save the object state in the DBp  pstrongSECONDstrong Save the object state in a global servicep  pMy problem is, I dont know, which way is the better one.p  pIf I choose the strongFIRSTstrong approach, I will have following approximate events orderp  ol lipUser gets the list with data loaded from the DB. 1 requestpli lipWhen double clicking on some data set, there will be a request to DB, which will provide data of the data set and its state inEdit or nothing. 1 requestpli lipWhen the user chooses edit on the data set  request to the DB to check if the object is still not in the inEdit state. If it is so  save new state of the object set inEdit and then allow the user to edit the object. If the object is in edit state  notify the user. 1 requestpli lipUser edited data and then clicks save  request to the DB  save new data, and reset objects inEdit state. 1 requestpli ol  p4 DB requestsp  pThe strongSECONDstrong approach has the following orderp  ol lipDB request to get the list of items. 1 requestpli lipDouble click  open data set  request object details from the DB and check for entries in the global service. 1 requestpli lipClicking edit   check for the state in the global service.pli lipWrite the object type and id in the global service if opened for edit.pli lipSaving edits  write edits in the DB and delete the service entry 1 requestpli ol  p3 requests  servicep  pI thing the idea with the service, isnt that good, because if You consider there will be a lot of objects opened and there will be a lot of such objects when the application grows, the service will have to store all the states. And that isnt good for the servers RAM, which will also have to store other data.p  pSo, what would You recommendp  pP.S.

Positive 107680 pWhen I append a random page name in my websites domain, The server returns error 503 internal server error. Which is not the case. Because the requested page doesnt exist at all. For example When I type Www.mysite.Comfoobar.php The server fires a 503 internal server error. Even though the foobar page doesnt Exist Meanwhile, when I type foobar.html it gives 404 page not found error which is correct. So how can I fix this  Thanks in advance. Editbr My problem is whenever I request a random page name from my website, it gives 503 error. which is wrong  I want to make it so that when I request a none existing page, it gives error 404, not 503.p

Positive 107680 pI have application which is hosted locally and online.  I have a lot of api calls, and we have need to change the prefix of url.  I have set value strongurlstrong with both url addressed, one is needed locally and one online.  So I have p  precode.valueurlPath,     .valueurlPath, httponlinewebsite8888 codepre  pIn this configuration, there is commented one and second not.  My question is, how to change urlPath dynamically, so there is no need by developers to comment and uncomment each time they deploy to server.  I know i can use location service, and if not, I can use javascript raw function to determine which host the website is located.  So I can make condition like this p  precode var host  location.host        if  host.indexOfonlinewebsite gt 1        set value to onlinewebsite     else        set value to localhost codepre  pI assume I can use this code snippet somehow in the beginning, like in .run module method.  But how to achieve this by setting Angulars Value conditionally My question is if value has method to set dynamically its value, how to reference it Or is there another solution, except creating service or inheriting controller.  I have a lot of controllers which are using value object, so the best solution would be with value. p  pAlso, if it is not possible, what is the difference between value and constantp  pI wanted to set it even dynamically in run method. its defined after value is defined.

So value doesnt changed.  When it is created, how to change value and when dynamically, so in each controller injected value during view loading would be finep

Negative 107680 pThe MSDN documentation for the SplitContainer controls says p  blockquote   pemWith the  SplitContainer control, you can create complex user interfaces   often, a selection in one panel   determines what objects are shown in   the other panel.emp blockquote  pSo, I have a SplitContainer that is split horizontally having top and bottom panels. What I would like to do is  when a control within Panel1 on top receives focus, I need a control within Panel2 bottom to be focused. And then the focus must go back to the control in Panel1 again.p  pThe problem is, the control in Panel2 returns false on CanFocus. I understand that for some kind of controls this can happen, and that every ancestor of the control must have focus for it to receive focus. I tried that too, but to no avail. The CanFocus still returns false.p  pIs there any alternative solution to this Has anyone tried this. What I am trying to do is essentially the same as what Outlook does.

When there are multiple worker processes Web garden, the filter will be loaded and run in each w3wp.exe.  p  pHow can I efficiently allow the filter to log its activities in a single consolidated logfilep  ul liplog messages from the different concurrent processes must not interfere with each other.

The websites may serve 100s of requests per second.  pli lipstrict time ordering is preferred.  In other words if w3wp.exe process 1 emits a message at t1, then process 2 emits a message at t2, then process 1 emits a message at t3, the messages should appear in proper time order in the log file. pli ul  pThe current approach I have is that each process owns a separate logfile.  This has obvious drawbacks. p  pSome ideas p  ul lipnominate one of the w3wp.exe to be logfile owner and send all log messages through that special process.  This has problems in case of worker process recycling. pli lipuse an OS mutex to protect access to the logfile.

Negative 107680 pExecutive summary how do I install a new root certificate into Java using Java codep  pWe have a desktop application which accesses various web services. Recently one of them switched their SSL certificate to one signed by Trustwave. While the Trustwave SSL certificates are accepted by regular internet browsers, Java does not seem to come with the prerequisite root certificates, and we lost access to the given web service with the following error messagep  precodejavax.net.ssl.SSLHandshakeException sun.security.validator.ValidatorException PKIX path building failed sun.security.provider.certpath.SunCertPathBuilderException unable to find valid certification path to requested target codepre  pWe got a temporary reprieve by convincing the provider to switch back to Verisign but when they switch back we have to be ready. So I need our desktop software to automatically install the Trustwave root certificate as needed. Our customers are not tech savvy enough to use the keytool command and I would rather not script it since that strikes me as a fragile solution separate implementations for Mac and PC, the struggle against Vista execution restrictions, trouble finding the correct JRE to install into, etc.p  pI imagine the keytool uses Java internally. What command could I use within Java to replicate the functionality of keytool and install the root certificate programmaticallyp
Negative 107680 pIm developing an ASP.NET MVC site that utilizes forms authentication for part of the application.

Negative 107680 pIm developing a web application for which final users have to create an account. This part is very easy Ill hash their passwords with SHA256 so that nobody, except the user himself, knows the password. Now comes the difficult part. After the user creates an account, heshe has to provide the password of hisher email server. Now the question is how can I protect this password decently the password will be stored in a database If I encrypt the password with TripleDES, any developer or system administrator would be able to decrypt the password and see it. What is the usual way to deal with such a problem Many Thanks.p
Negative 107680 pWe have the following table structure p  precodetblA     AID INT PK     TypeID INT   tblEA     EAID INT PK     AID FK to tblA     CID INT reference to other table based on TypeID from tblA   tblC     CID INT PK  codepre  pSo, were thinking tblA is abstract class, and each type is a  subclass, discriminator based on TypeID. But then we run into  problems handling tblEA. It has a fake discriminator, in that you  join to tblA in order to determine the type. This is bc having a  TypeID column in tblEA is redundant, you have to join on tblA  anyway to get that data there are more columns to the tables, but not  needed for this. Then, we have to somehow map the relationship bw  tblC and tblEA. p  pSQL to get all EA items for a C entity select  from tblEA where  CID   AND AID IN select AID from tblA where typeid  . p  pAny ideas on how to set up mapping for these tables, and corresponding  relationships I feel like answer may lie in the formula of a  discriminator, but cant figure it out. p

Negative 107680 pI dont know what could be causing this issue, but for some reason, elements on my page list navigation items, specifically, are disappearing in IE6. That is, from IE developer toolbar, I can see that the elements are there, and the DOMcss is correct, but the elements just arent visible.p  pThe odd thing is that if you set or toggle ANY css element on the list items with the IE6 toolbar, the elements appear. I also have a codehovercode jQuery action set on the list navigation items, and the event fires as if the elements were visible and working correctly.p  pWhat could possibly be going wrong here I initially thought zindex could be an issue, but changing ANY attribute or css value not necessarily zindex, causes the element to render. I should note, however, that doing this programmatically does emnotem cause the elements to display properly, even if triggered seconds after the page load.p

Negative 107680 pIm a relative newbie to PHP, but it seems to me that PHPs error handling is a bit of a ghetto, with errors and warnings interspersed with exceptions and dont get me started on codediecode. As such, Im not certain how best to go about creating, interpreting, and handling all error cases in my application.p  pMy general plan of attack is roughly as followsp  ol liConvert all warningserrors into Exceptions, using codeseterrorhandlercode to wrap the errors as they come.li liCode defensively, preemptively checking for things I expect to go wrong. Throw exceptions only when I cant handle the error directly. Usual codetrycatchcode blocks will be in place when needed, to handle exceptions I dont throw myself.li liWrap my entire application i.e. my codeindex.phpcode pointofentry file in its own codetrycatchcode. Should that fail, Ill throw an codeHTTP 500code and show a suitable error page. Presumably this page will be a single, precompiled file rather than a collection of headerbodyfooter includes  this is largely so that I can still cover weird exceptions like a garbled template file. I assume this is why Googles 500class error page looks so much different from everything else they put out.li liAs a corollary to 2 and 3, since Im expecting to handle everything upfront, if I decide to throw my own exception, Im also expecting emnotem to catch the error, and instead let it bubble all the way up to my top level handler. The thinking here is that if I cant handle it when it happens, Im probably illequipped to handle it anywhere else. Im thinking of giving these errors their own subclass  perhaps codeCriticalErrorExceptioncode  that can be identified directly in my logsspawn an email so I can look into it quickly. In general, Im expecting these to be things that emmayem happen in dev, but should be ironed out by production.li liAny error that makes it to the top gets logged in the database, with failover to a log file. Critical errors, as indicated above, trigger an email. If the reporting fails over to the file  i.e. theres a DB error  that would also trigger an email.li ol  pI think this covers most cases pretty well, but as I said Im very new to PHP so I dont know if there are corner cases or weird behaviours that Im overlooking.p  pWhat are the flaws in my plan How can I overcome themp

Negative 107680 pI am fairly new to DI with Autofac and wonder if the following is possible p  pI want to create a generic controller and action that receives an  injected type.  I do not want an instance of the injected type, but just need its type, which would be an inplementation of an expected interface. p  pI would also like to pass that generic type on to a ViewModel, but that is another subject altogether, however if some genious out there can solve both that would be excellent.p  precodepublic ContractorControllerltTgt  Controller      where T  IContractor       public ViewResult New               var vNewModel  new NewViewModelltTgt              return ViewvNewModel              codepre  pThis controller should be called through  codehttpmysite.comContractorNewcodep  pI have been looking into registering generics with AutoFac, but it  seems that the problem is that the AutofacControllerFactory only implements GetControllerInstance, expecting the controller Type passed to it from either GetController or CreateController, not sure which or what the diffirence is between them. These methods receive the controllers name as a string from RoutData and return the corresponding .NET type which, give the url, codehttpmysite.comContractorNewcode is controllerContractor and thus ContractorController cannot be matched by GetController or CreateController and therfore passing null to GetControllerInstance which mean AutofacControllerFactory does not attempt to resolve the type.p  pI figured that I would have to create a custom Controller Factory  deriving from AutofacControllerFactory, override GetController or CreateController and  perform my own mapping from the controller names to the generic types.  Something like p  pif controllerName  Contractor      return System.Type.GetType          UI.Controllers.  controllerName  Controller1 p  pWhen I debug this I can see that this code is finding the generic controller and returning it.p  pI thought I could then just register the types like p  precodebuilder.RegisterTypeltFakeContractorgt.AsltIContractorgt  builder.RegisterGenerictypeofContractorControllerltgt  codepre  pBut I am getting the following error p  precodeThe Autofac service  UI.Controllers.ContractorController1  representing controller  ContractorManagement.UI.Controllers.ContractorController1  in path ContractorNew has not been registered.  codepre  pSo I think I may be barking up the wrong tree.

The reference variable is of type codeCatcode, and so, can only control codeCatcode and any subclasses of codeCatcode.p  pI am then creating an codeObjectcode reference variable of type codeObjectcode, and pointing it at felix codeCatcode object, which works but with limited functionality as the JVM now sees the felix object of being of type codeObjectcode, so, if for instance there was a method codepurrcode defined in the codeCatcode class, felix would no longer be able to use it.p  pSo a reference is expected of the type codeCatcode, but we are providing a reference for a superclass of type cat rather than a subclass as it says in the definition above, and this is allowed, but with limited functionalityunless you do a cast.p  pAm I correct or way off p

Negative 107680 pI have a DataGridView which is databound to a BindingList. My DataGridView also has a couple of custom columns that I have added. These are not databound, but rather are generated based on items in my BindingList ie an item in my BindingList of type A has a property of type B my custom column shows B.Name strongemEDITemstrong In this case, Name is a property of the class B, and thus the property represented by the column is not directly found in the items in the BindingList.p  pI need to be able to sort all of the columns in my DataGridView.

I definitely suppose we should use the information contained in the MIDI file to give some hints to the pitch detection algorithm.p  pSuch a matching tool could be very useful, for example for MIDI humanization we could make the MIDI representation more expressive using the information retrieved from the WAV signal to fine tune note onsets, durations, dynamics, etc...p  pDoes anybody know if such a problem has already been addressed in literature Any form of contribution or assistance will be greatly appreciated.p  pThanks in advance.p

Negative 107680 pIm trying to emulate a function in SQL that a client has produced in Excel.  In effect, they have a unique, 10digit numeric value VARCHAR as the primary key in one of their enterprise database systems.  Within another database, they require a unique, 5digit alphanumeric identifier.  They want that 5digit alphanumeric value to be a representation of the 10digit number.  So what they did in excel was to split the 10digit number into pairs, then convert each of those pairs into a hexadecimal value, then stitch them back together.p  pThe EXCEL equation is p  blockquote   pIFVALUEMIDA2,1,40,DEC2HEXVALUEMIDA2,3,2ampDEC2HEXVALUEMIDA2,5,2ampDEC2HEXVALUEMIDA2,7,2ampDEC2HEXVALUEMIDA2,9,2,DEC2HEXVALUEMIDA2,5,2ampDEC2HEXVALUEMIDA2,7,2ampDEC2HEXVALUEMIDA2,9,2p blockquote  pI need the SQL equivalent of this.  Of course, should someone out there know a better way to accomplish their goal of a 5digit alphanumeric identifier based off the 10digit number, Im all ears.p  pADDED 822011p  pFirst of all, strongthank youstrong to everyone for the replies.  Nice to see folks willing to help and even enjoying it  Based on all the responses, Im apt to tell my client theyre intent is sound, only their method is off kilter.  Id also like to recommend a solution.  So the challenge remains, just modified slightlyp  pCHALLENGE Within SQL, take a 10 digit, unique NUMERIC string and represent it ALPHANUMERICALLY in as few characters as possible.  The resulting string must also be unique.  p  pNote that the first 34 characters in the 10digit string are likely to be zeros, and that they could be stripped to shorten the resulting alphanumeric string.  Not required, but perhaps helpful. p

Negative 107680 pIve just begun using South and am still in the process of figuring it out. Lets say I have the initial migration script of a model.

Im creating the migration script by running code.manage.py schemamigration myappname autocode.p  pLets say I have a server on which my project is deployed but it was based on the initial schema of the application but now it lags behind the repository by two migrations.

Negative 107680 pIn my little iPad app I have a switch language function that uses an observer. Every view controller registers itself with my observer during its codeviewDidLoadcode.p  precode voidviewDidLoad      [super viewDidLoad]     [observer registerObjectself]  codepre  pWhen the user hits the change language button, the new language is stored in my model and the observer is notified and calls an codeupdateUicode selector on its registered objects.p  pThis works very well, except for when I have view controllers in a TabBarController.

Because of this, I moved my coderegisterObjectcode calls into the codeinitcode method.p  pBack when I used codeviewDidLoadcode to register with my observer, I used codeviewDidUnloadcode to unregister.

Negative 107680 pIm creating a video capture program and I store each frame from in camera into a codeListltBitmapgtcode object but my problem is I ran out of memory after a very short time despite having a generous RAM 6GB. I have been able to narrow down my problem to the amount of images being stored in the codeListltgtcode object 15000 bitmaps in 10 mins at 25fps. I think a realistic solution is to save the images to disk rather than save it in the program. But how do I save such a fast stream of objects to disk and still be able read the images back when I want to playback the images. Or is it possible to save the images as they come to a video stream and then convert to a video at the end of the streaming I noticed converting the images to video reduced the combine size of the files considerablyp

Negative 107680 pIn the context of SharePoint, I call a dialog. SharePoint basically created a lightbox div and puts my html inside. I have no control over where it decides to display the dialog, nor of its dimensions, and not even of the CSS used for the containing page. In other words, whatever I can do must be included inside my own htmljavascriptCSS.p  pThe problem arrives because my html contains this one div that is sometimes too high for the dialog, which I would then naturally like to have a vertical scrollbar. I therefore define it with the CSS style of overflowauto.p  pBut what I get instead is a scrollbar over the entire dialog, while the div is contained entirely in the dialog with no scrollbar at all.p  pI have traced the DOM, and I believe that the source of the problem is that the lightbox div containing my dialog is also defined with overflowauto. Apparently this takes precedence over the inner div, so that the vertical scrollbar is put on the containing div rather than on my inner div.p  pI am looking for a way to move the scrollbar from the dialog to the inner div. Please remember that I cannot change the CSS to get rid of the overflowauto in the lightbox div that contains my html.p  pI can fix the problem by setting the height of the inner div to an absolute pixel value, but as I cannot predict in advance how much screen space is allocated to the other elements of the dialog or to the dialog itself, the visual results could be rather ugly.p  pAny ideas p  pBelow is a simplistic example of the layout of the problem p  precodeltdiv styleoverflowautogt lt lightbox div gt  lt start of my html gt ltdiv styleoverflowauto importantgt lt high div gt ltdivgt ltdivgt ltbuttongtltbuttongt ltbuttongtltbuttongt ltdivgt lt end of my html gt  ltdivgt lt end of lightbox div gt codepre  pI should also mention that I am using Internet Explorer 9.p

Any help is appreciated.p  pCodep  precodeltphp include..includesheader.phpgt ltdiv classcontent aligncentergt  ltphp     function SQLResultTableQuery              link  mysqlconnectlocalhost, ..., ... or dieCould not connect  . mysqlerror         mysqlselectdb... or dieCould not select database         Table            Table. lttable border0 aligncentergt          Result  mysqlqueryQuery Execute the query         ifmysqlerror                      Table. lttrgtlttdgtMySQL ERROR  . mysqlerror . lttdgtlttrgt                  else                      Header Row with Field Names             NumFields  mysqlnumfieldsResult              Table. lttr stylebackgroundcolor D00000 floatcenter fontsize14px color FFFFFF aligncentergt             for i0 i lt NumFields i                                  if mysqlfieldnameResult, ia1  Table. ltthgta1ltthgt                   else if mysqlfieldnameResult, ia2  Table. ltthgta2ltthgt                   else if mysqlfieldnameResult, ia3  Table. ltthgta3ltthgt                   else if mysqlfieldnameResult, ia4  Table. ltthgta4ltthgt                   else if mysqlfieldnameResult, ia5  Table. ltthgta5ltthgt                   else if mysqlfieldnameResult, ia6  Table. ltthgta6ltthgt                   else if mysqlfieldnameResult, ia7  Table. ltthgta7ltthgt                   else if mysqlfieldnameResult, ia8  Table. ltthgta8ltthgt                   else if mysqlfieldnameResult, ia9  Table. ltthgta9ltthgt                   else if mysqlfieldnameResult, ia10  Table. ltthgta10ltthgt                   else if mysqlfieldnameResult, ia11  Table. ltthgta11ltthgt                   else if mysqlfieldnameResult, ia12  Table. ltthgta12ltthgt                   else  Table. ltthgt . mysqlfieldnameResult, i . ltthgt                           Table. lttrgt              RowCt  0              whileRow  mysqlfetchassocResult                              timezone  new DateTimeZone EuropeLondon                  date  new DateTime                 dategtsetTimezone timezone                  now  dategtformat Hi                   if issetSESSION[b2]                      Table.lttr stylebackgroundcolorredgt                  else if issetSESSION[b1]                      Table.lttr stylebackgroundcoloryellowgt                  else                      Table.lttr stylebackgroundcolorwhitegt                                   foreachRow as field gt value                      if field  b1                          if value gt now                              SESSION[b1]  b1                             Table. lttd stylefontsize14px aligncentergtvaluelttdgt                          else                              Table. lttd stylefontsize14px aligncentergtvaluelttdgt                                               else if field  b2                          if value gt now                              SESSION[b2]  b2                             Table. lttd stylefontsize14px aligncentergtvaluelttdgt                          else                              Table. lttd stylefontsize14px aligncentergtvaluelttdgt                                               else                          Table. lttd stylefontsize14px aligncentergtvaluelttdgt                                                       Table. lttrgt                          Table. lttr stylebackgroundcolor FFFFFF fontsize10px color 000000gtlttd colspanNumFieldsgtltbr gtQuery returned  . mysqlnumrowsResult .  results.lttdgtlttrgt                  Table. lttablegt         return Table      gt  ltphp     echo ltdiv aligncentergtltugtltstronggtlta hrefindex.phpgtQuery Resultsltagtltstronggtltugtltdivgt     echo SQLResultTableSELECT a1,a2,a3,a4,a5,a6,a7,a8,a9,a10,a11,a12 FROM testdb ORDER BY a6  gt ltdivgt codepre  pp  pNow, the codenowcode value returns the actual hour, i.e. 0830 and codevaluecode on fields codeb1code and codeb2code returns a similar value on the same format that is stored from a previous form.p  pThe deal is this When its late value on field b1 is greater than now, it colors up the row on yellow.

Negative 107680 pIve written a class called DebugText. The point of the class is to have a nice way of printing values of variables to the game screen.

However, the strongValuestrong for one of the key may be a strongString or a Liststrongdepends on the number of values a particular key can have. Value will be a String if that particular key has only one value and it has to be a List if the key contains many values. How to accomplish this scenariop  pFor Example there are 2 keys in a map namely Name and Phone Nos. A person can have only one name and multiple phone numbers. So here the first key i.e. Name should have String type for Value, whereas for the second key i.e. Phone Nos should have List type for Value. How to declare such a Map. Is it possiblep

Now If I was convert the hyperlink button to the  tag, I would have to go to every instance of that particular button to replace the  tag with a  tag and if this button exists on so many pages, then updating would be time consuming.p  pThat was just a simplistic example, then I have to think for other repeated elements across multiple pages such as breadcrumbs, list tables etc.p  pIs there any way to code in a way where I can actually reuse these UI elements that may be worthwhile to look at Perhaps I could try to code each of these elements into classes, but right now I am not sure.p  pAny hints, pointers or resources would very helpful and appreciated.p  pThanks guys.p

Or, rather, it works in terms of the deleting the item from the database, but it does not disappear from the screen.  If I reload the page, it is gone.

Negative 107680 pIm trying to build an Eclipse plugin that depends on a library which has to be distributed separate to it. The reasons for that arep  ol liIts a commercial library, while the plugin will be distributed freely. Also, most people wont need it and we dont want to confuse users.li liThere are currently at least two versions of the library in use and we dont want to build two different versions of the plugin. The interface is compatible, so we can ship just one version of the plugin.li ol  pThe plugin is for an Eclipsebased development environment and the purpose is to provide our librarys functionality within that environment. The library itself depends on other free components, which I can bundle with it without a problem.p  pSince I dont know if Im allowed to say exactly which library it is, but I must keep this unambiguous, lets call the library L and the plugin Im trying to develop P.p  pIm using the bnd tool for this and so far Ive tried both packaging L as a standalone plugin, and as a plugin fragment.p  pAs a standalone plugin, it was accepted by the host eclipse environment and I could list it as a dependency of P and successfully build that. However, at runtime the P plugin didnt see resources from the L library on its classpath. Mainly those in METAINFservices are needed.p  pNext, I tried packaging L as a plugin fragment for P. I hoped this would work, since the specs say, that a fragments classpath is merged with its host plugins. This didnt work, because I couldnt use the classes from L as build dependencies of P  putting L in eclipses plugins directory didnt result in it being recognised as an installed plugin.p  pSo Im stuck. I need Ls jars as part of Ps runtime and build classpath, while at the same time having them in a separate plugin. Is what Im trying to do even possiblep

Negative 107680 pI want to use Facebook as an authentication source for my application a website users. I do not want my application to have anything but basic and email permissions. Thus, my application must not be able to publish to a users wall for example. In other words, I want to restrict the allowable set of values for the scope parameter and I want this restriction to occur on the applications configuration pages on the Facebook site itself.p  pNormally this would be easy, just specify email for the scope parameter of the OAuth URLcall.p  pHowever in this case there is another factor and this is a hacker may gain access to the app and change the OAuth call to specify more permissions. Then an unsuspecting user will typically or at least possibly grant those permissions and the hacker will be able to grab the OAuth token and perform actions on behalf of that user.p  pIm not interested in discussing the whys of this issue, just in finding of there is a way to specify that my application can only use a specific set of values for the scope parameter. Ideally this specification of the scope restriction be done in the application configuration page on Facebook itself.p  pHowever, I am interested in alternate solutions that involve using SAML, OpenID or some other authentication only mechanism even if I cannot get the users email address. Im not interested in using RPX.p  pPlease note this is a complex question not a simple one. I have searched far and wide for an answer and have just found what amounts to the opposite of this question.p

Negative 107680 pI have a form with jquery validation. I have some custom rules, but they all check out and work fine on other forms. In fact, it works just fine on THIS form except for one specific situation. We have a text input for a URL. We wrote a regex to disallow script tags. And it works fine.p  pIf you fill out the form with errors and submit it, you have error messages. As expected. But this URL field... If you entered a valid URL before failure and then change it to a script tag and click save the error message immediately appears but then the form submits anyway. If you tab away from the field first, you see the error message. But clicking save still saves the form.p  pIve tried using a page load function to disable the form action and to replace the action with a check if the form is valid. If you leave the form blank and click save, you get errors. If you fill it out, you get nothing. Clicking save does nothing at all.p  pHere is my form tag. The fields dont really matter.

Negative 107680 pIs anyone familiar with the ticket lock algorithm which replaces the basic spinlock algorithm in the linux kernel I am hoping to find an expert on this. Ive read from a few online sources that the ticket lock algorithm is supposed to be faster, since the naive algorithm overwhelms the CPU bus with all threads trying to get the lock at the same time. Can anyone confirmdeny this for mep  pI did some experiments of my own. The ticket lock is indeed fair, but its performance is just about on par with the pthread spinlock algorithm. In fact, it is just a touch slower.p  pThe way I see it, an unfair algorithm should be a bit faster since the thread that hogs the lock early on finishes more quickly, giving the scheduler less work to do.p  pId like to get some more perspective on this. If it isnt faster, why is ticket lock implemented in the kernel and why is it not used in user space thanksp

Negative 107680 pstrongBRIEFstrongp  pHow do I tag multiple changesets in Mercurial with the same tag Possibly on the same branch, possibly on different branches.p  pE.g. something like a tag that says whether the full QA test ran.p  pI can create multiple instances of a tag by editing the file, but the hg tools nearly always ignore all but the first.p  pstrongDETAILstrongp  pI am looking for what I call changeset attributes  a concept that I have used in other CVS and DVCS, but which I cannot seem to find in Mercurial.p  pBasically, an attribute is very much like a tag, but where a tag is only supposed to refer to a single changeset, an attribute may apply to multiple changesets.p  pQ does anyone know how to do thisp  pSimilarly is there a way to attach a description to a ChangeSet, after the changeset has been created.  Note that i do not want to rewrite history I do not want to delete or change or replace the original checkin message.  I just want to add some more stuff  and have that more stuff appear in queries like hg log.  E.g. I forgot to add a file to commit df..a3  look instead to commit 8f..77 where I checked in the missing files.p  pstrongEXCRUCIATING DETAILstrongp  pI know  you can do hg tag f to force a tag to apply to more than one changeset.   But so many other hg tag related features really only work with a single changesrty per tag. Or at least only one changeset per line of descent  i.e. per head.p  pSo you can leave a tag defined forever and ever. I like placing the date or other context in such a tag  e.g. testspass20120114.p  pOr you can have a floating tag, that moves upwards  e.g. most recent rev where all the slow tests pass, which I might call simply testspass.p  pBy the way, you may apply such attributes or tags after the checkin  especially if you have a slow QA process, perhaps a quick smoke test, followed by a slower full set of tests that may take a week to complete. So you checkin, and then, later, go back and apply the attribute, the uniqified dated tag.  And you may later need to go back and modify such a tag, e.g. if more tests are added, so that a changeset that used to pass all tests no longer does.  E.g. alltestspass20120114 and alltestspass20120115 may apply to the same changeset.p  pBut it is onerous to have to uniqify such fixed tags. Hence what I call an attribute a tag that applies to multiple changesets, Which is version controlled.  So you might apply alltestspass to rev 105, and then later to 106 and 107.  But then you realize that new tests fail on 106, so you repally.p  pThen the attribute history might look likep  precode105     tagged alltestspass on 2012011410h00 in changeset XXX     tagged alltestspass on 2012011510h00 in changeset YYY  106     tagged alltestspass on 2012011413h00 in changeset XXX     tagged notalltestspass on 2012011513h00 in changeset YYY  107     tagged alltestspass on 2012011414h00 in changeset XXX     tagged alltestspass on 2012011510h00 in changeset YYY codepre  pand a revset query likep  precode 105107 and currentattributetagalltestspass codepre  p returns 105 and 107 on the latest, at or after YYY is in the repo     but returns 105, 106, 107 if cloned so as not to include YYYp  pwhilep  precode 105107 and attributetagatanytimealltestspass codepre  preturns 105 106 and 107 at any time if the repo holds XXXp  pp  pI would like to be able to do things likep  ul liprun hg bisect, but only on changesets tagged testspass.pli lipexclude certain log messages from hg log and glogpli ul  petc.p  pp  pBy the way, I reject phases and bookmarks for this purpose because they are not version controlled.  And I want these attribute tags to be VCed, so that I can follow something like to ebb and flow of alltestspass, as mentioned above.p  pbranches are almost what I want, because Mercurial branches are really changeset attributes, not branches.  But I dont think that the branch associated with a changeset can be changed after the commit.p  pI really wish that you could switch changesets to a branch after you commit them.  I call this wished for feature retroactive branching.p  pp  pHeres a classic example of why I might want attributes have you ever forgotten to add a file to the VCS And then have a changeset that fails to build  Add the file in a subsequent changest ...p  pI would like to be able to retroactively mark a changeset as willnotbuildmissingfiles.

Negative 107680 pIm trying to handle the problem where a user can try to open, with an codeOpenFileDialogcode, a file that is open by Excel.p  pUsing the simple codeFileInfo.OpenReadcode, it chucks an codeIOExceptioncode, The process cannot access the file cakes.xls because it is being used by another process. This would be fine to display to the user except that the user will actually get Debugging resource strings are unavailable nonsense.p  pIt seems not possible to open a file that is open by another process, since using codeFileInfo.OpenFileMode.Open, FileAccess.Read, FileShare.ReadWritecode chucks a codeSecurityExceptioncode, File operation not permitted. Access to path Cwhatevercakes.xls is denied., for any file. Rather unhelpful.p  pSo its down to either finding some way of checking if the file is locked, or trying to catch the IOException. I dont want to catch emallem IOExceptions and assume theyre all locked file errors, so I need some sort of way of classifying this type of exception as this error... but the Debugging resource strings nonsense along with the fact that that message itself is probably localized makes it tricky. Im partial trust, so I cant use codeMarshal.GetHRForExceptioncode.p  pSo Is there any sensible way of either check if a file is locked, or at least determining if this problem occurred without just catching all IOExceptionsp

Negative 107680 pAlright, so my last question was really vague and I didnt describe it near as much as I should have.  Basically, this is what I want to happen 1 Get list of the users friends 2 Display them in any kind of container.  I go to look at the  graph API documentation, but that doesnt really help me given the fact that I am a visual learner.  To get that basic functions of the Mobile Application, I followed tutorials that left me at a cliff hanger as far as implementing other more complex features into the Application.  I will list the links to the Mobile a Application here a hrefhttpblogs.adobe.comflexdoc201110createamobilefacebookflexapplicationinflashbuilder45part1.html relnofollowPart 1a, a hrefhttpblogs.adobe.comflexdoc201110createamobilefacebookflexapplicationinflashbuilder45part2.html relnofollowPart 2a. Those tutorials helped me a lot.  But when they were over and I had to start implementing features my self, I was kind of left at a standstill.  Ive been searching and searching for how to do this, but could not really find anything that helped since they were all for Desktop Applications.  Ive also looked at the sample code that the Facebook API supplies for reference.  But none is for flex Mobile, and it also seems that youd have to write your code exactly like theirs to get those features to work properly.  Alright. So once again, I just want to be able to have a list of friends to show up.  I will worry about getting details of the friends later. I think I might be able to manage that.  Also, I am going to post all of my code because I am in no way protective of it right now. I will state one thing though. In NO way am I asking for someone to write the code for me.  I am just a very visual dependent learner.  But I think if I can get the process of implementing features explained in a more simpler manor, I would be able to take care of my own.  Which also brings up another question.  Since I am a Visual Person.  Would using flash instead of Flash Builder be more suitable for me Anyways.  You dont have to answer that.

Negative 107680 pOften times when writing code, I find myself using a value from a particular function call multiple times. I realized that an obvious optimization would be to capture these repeatedly used values in variables. This pseudo code p  precodefunction add1foo foo  1  ... dosomethingfoo1 dosomethingelsefoo1 codepre  pBecomesp  precodefunction add1foo foo  1  ... bar  foo1 dosomethingbar dosomethingelsebar codepre  pHowever, doing this explicitly makes code less readable in my experience. I assumed that compilers could not do this kind of optimization if our language of choice allows functions to have sideeffects. p  pRecently I looked into this, and if I understand correctly, this optimization iscan be done for languages where functions must be pure. That does not surprise me, but supposedly this can also be done for impure functions. With a few quick Google searches I found these snippets a hrefhttpgcc.gnu.orggcc4.7changes.htmlGCC 4.7 Fortran improvementap  blockquote   pWhen performing frontendoptimization, the faggressivefunctionelimination option allows the removal of duplicate function calls even for impure functions.p blockquote  pa hrefhttpen.wikipedia.orgwikiCompileroptimizationCompiler Optimization Wikipediaap  blockquote   pFor example, in some languages functions are not permitted to have side effects. Therefore, if a program makes several calls to the same function with the same arguments, the compiler can immediately infer that the functions result need be computed only once. In languages where functions are allowed to have side effects, another strategy is possible. The optimizer can determine which function has no side effects, and restrict such optimizations to side effect free functions. This optimization is only possible when the optimizer has access to the called function.p blockquote  pFrom my understanding, this means that an optimizer can determine when a function is or is not pure, and perform this optimization when the function is. I say this because if a function always produces the same output when given the same input, and is side effect free, it would fulfill both conditions to be considered pure. p  pThese two snippets raise two questions for me.p  ol liHow can a compiler be able to safely make this optimization if a function is not pure as in faggressivefunctioneliminationli liHow can a compiler determine whether a function is pure or not as in the strategy suggested in the Wikipedia articleli ol  pand finally p  ul liCan this kind of optimization be applied to any language, or only when certain conditions are metli liIs this optimization a worthwhile one even for extremely simple functions li liHow much overhead does storing and retrieving a value from the stack incurli ul  pI apologize if these are stupid or illogical questions.

Negative 107680 pIm writing a program and trying to learn more about threads, multiprocessing, and such.p  pMy architecture is a ModelViewController type.p  pI have my own subclass of codeNSImageViewcode ThumbnailView and I wanted to be clever and have it listen for a message to clear itself so all the thumbnails just clear themselves without me having to loop through them.p  pThe problem is my codeThumbnailViewcode is controlled by a codeThumbnailViewControllercode which is really the one listening for the message.  When it gets the message it spins off a new thread with a class object that is the command codeClearThumbnailViewCommandcode.  It passes as an argument a dictionary item containing the associated codeThumbnailViewcode object and a key.  Within the codeClearThumbnailViewCommandcode I set the image of the codeThumbnailViewcode object to be some neutral image like gray.jpg.p  pAll this works fine, however, the Thumbnail object that changed is not the same Thumbnail object that went in.  So I figure I need to pass a pointer rather than the object.  I remember something about using codeMyObjectcode as opposed to codeMyObjectcode and passing via codeampMyObjectcode but I cant seem to untangle the various combinations.  Not being able to reason it out I fell back to my, normally, foolproof system of trying random combinations of things but this time its not helping.  p  pIt seems that even if Im able to construct a class that passes a pointer Not sure if Im using these terms correctly, Im not able to assign it correctly to the codeNSDictionarycode, which doesnt want an codeidcode .  p  pIll try and include the basics below, if that helps at all.p  hr  precodeThumbnailVew  NSImageView      ThumbnailVewController   controller   init       controller  [[ControllerClass alloc] initWithControlObject ampself]  codepre  hr  precodeThumbnailVewController  ControllerClass      id   controlObject   initWithControlObject idobject      controlObject  object  codepre  hr  pThen when messages are posted a codeThumbnailVewControllercode method is called which ultimately does this Which, of course will not let me pass in codeampcontrolObjectcodep  pwhen it is all rewritten so that I can pass codecontrolObjectcode, I dont get an error, however the codeThumbnailViewcode I change is only local to the method.p  precodeif[command isEqualToStringCLEARTHUMBNAILS]      NSDictionary  dict     dict  [[NSDictionary alloc] initWithObjectsAndKeys ampcontrolObject, thumbnail, nil]      [self newThreadWithCommand[[[ClearThumbnailViewCommand alloc] initWithArgumentdict] autorelease]]  codepre  pIs this even possible p
Negative 107680 pIm doing realtime image analysis which is capturing by camera in iOSipad or iphone. Actually i just want to analysis the image which is clear imaging, if the image is not clear ,i want to discard it. Its known that the image is not clear when the camera is not focus. p  pNow my question is p  ol liWhether the iOS can give some indicator the camera have finished focusli liIf i move the iPad camera to aim to some object,How i can get the indicator the object image is clearli ol  pIn my projcet, i use the AVCaptureDevice to autofocus object. It provide the interface isAdjustingFocus to indicator the camera is focusing. But it is not enough to decide the image is clear. i find when i move the camera then stop, the iOS have some delay to start focus. So When  i move the ipad ,the image is blurry ,but the indicator is still indicate that it isnt focusing.So i cant get the mode to know the image is clear.p

Negative 107680 pI am running a UDP Java implementation using DatagramSocket where the receive is running on one thread and the sending operations are run on a separate thread.  When my program starts up, I need to make a call out to a server and receive information back.  The problem is, due to the threading, even though I start my receiving thread first, sometimes the send will go out first and when the server replies, the socket has not called receive yet in the other thread.  Since this thread blocks on the receive line, I cant use a flag to verify that receive has been called. Is there any way to check if the socket is currently blocking on receive so that I can wait to send until I verify that conditionp

So images are split exactly on half position.li liIt happens more often when selecting images that are listed previous to the currently selected image So, select an image, and then maybe select the image on its leftli liThe CSS values assigned to the elements appear to be correctli liThe flash banner on the right is the lead suspect, because disabling it resolves the issue completely. Unfortunately, it has to stay.li liThe embedded flash player in Chrome seems to have more problems than the native flash player installed when running under Internet Explorer. So, in short, Internet Explorer users dont have this problem as muchli ul  pAll was working well until I installed the flash banner on the right. Does the flash player have the ability to mess with javascriptp  pThanks in advance, to anyone who are willing to investigatep  pEDIT I have just realized quite an odd situation. The oddity corrects itself when the page, or the gallery rerenders for any reason, such as windowresize, zoom change, or gallery being overlapped with another element such as the dropdown navigation menus This is very odd. Has anyone ran into such a problem where the page content gets garbled, but, resizing the browser window fixes itp

Negative 107680 pI have a struct QUAD that stores 4 pointers to 4 VECTOR3D which contains 3 floats so that I can draw the quad mesh. From what I understand is whenever I draw a mesh, I need normal as well to properly lightshade a mesh and its relatively easy when its a mesh laying on a plain, using normal per face.p  pWhen I have 2 by 2 quad meshes laying on XZ coordinate and tried to raise its centre 0,0,0 by a certain point, say 0, 4, 0 it would start to form real 3D shapes, then I need to calculate normals again. Im having hard time understanding how and what is to be to calculated normals. As expected, the 3D shape shades like its still a flat mesh, so it does not represent real shape. One of the explanation says I need to calculate normals per vertex instead of per face.  Does it mean I need to calculate normals for all corners of mesh once i have normals what would i do I was still using old glBegin glEnd methods but now I feel like i need to use DrawArray method. Im deeply confused and Im pretty sure I dont make much sound but id much appreciate your help.p

They feel that this is the only acceptable solution to ensure the application is always  secure.p  h2Problemh2  pThe problem is twofold, so lets deal with the first one. If a user is logged in and on a page they can copy the URL, open up a new tab, close the previous tab, paste the URL, and the session is still alive. I understand why this is happening but they are saying we need to keep that from happening. strongAnd please dont ask me why, if I could answer that I probably would be convincing them otherwise.strongp  pThe second part of the problem is that the way the application was originally written insert strongreallystrong emangryem face here two of the web forms are reused for enrollment. This specifically means that those pages are accessible even if the user isnt logged in. However, we have to make it so that they were specifically referred to those pages through the process flow and thus not directly accessible.p  pAs an example for the aforementioned paragraph, consider the following. The user copies the URL to one of the shared forms, opens up a new browser, and pastes in the URL. The session is dead but the form displays for the purposes of enrollment. However, this is problematic because they havent accepted the terms strongemandemstrong they have broken the already fragile flow.p  h2What have I triedh2  pHonestly, nothing. Im up here panning for ideas because the best Ive seen thus far Googling is stuff surrounding strongensure the user is logged in firststrong.

Negative 107680 pThe controller redirect method in Lithium does an actual HTTP redirect. But is there a method to simply forward a request to another controlleraction without an HTTP redirectp  pFor example, say I want to add an authentication layer and rather than redirecting the user to a authlogin page, the login layout and template get rendered rather than the content for the page they requested. Then, when they submit the form and they authenticate, theyre already on the page they requested. Zend framework has something similar with a forward method.p  pThanksp

Negative 107680 pIm running some fairly simple tests using browsermob and selenium to open firefox browsers and navigate through a random pages. Each firefox instance is supposed to be independent and none of them share any cookies or cache. On my mac osx machine, this works quite nicely. The browsers open, navigate through a bunch of pages and then close. On my windows machine, however, even after the firefox browser closes, the tmpstrongstrong folders remain and, after leavin the test going on for a while, they begin to take up a lot of space. I was under the impression that each newly spawned browser would have its own profile, which it clearly does, but that it would delete the profile it made when the browser closes. Is there an explicit selenium command Im missing to enforce this behaviourp  pAdditionally, Ive noticed that some of the tmp folders are showing up in AppDataLocalTemp2 and that many others are showing up in the folder where I started running the script...p

So I opened Eclipse, and ran a type search for codeorg.slf4j.Loggercode and sure enough, I see that class listed in 2 distinct JARs codeslf4japi1.6.6.jarcode as expected, and another 3rd party jar, codewidgetlib3.0.jarcode.p  pSo I opened up codewidgetlib3.0.jarcode, and see SLF4J packaged up inside of it like sop  precodewidgetlib3.0     com         ltWidget Libs compiled classesgt     org         slf4j             spi                 ...             impl                 ...             ltA bunch of SLF4J classes, like LoggerFactory.class, etc.gt codepre  pTheres no way to tell what version of SLF4J its using here, but Id be willing to bet that its a version thats earlier than 1.6.x, which is what Camel 2.10.3 wants.p  pSo my best, slightlyeducated guess is that at runtime, the JRE classloaders are finding codewidgetlib3.0.jarorgslf4jLoggercode first, loading it, and emthenem they go to load the Camel JARs and their dependencies. Then, when codeDefaultPackageScanClassResolvercode calls the SLF4J codetraceString,Objectcode method, its not finding the 1.6.6 version of SLF4J, rather, its finding whatever version came with codewidgetlib3.0.jarcode, and that methodoverload doesnt exist.p  pAm I on track of way off base If Im off base, what does this mean to you, SO And if I am on track, then my proposed solution would be to reJAR codewidgetlib3.0.jarcode without the codeorgslf4jcode packages in it no other, more modern versions exist. My theory being that codeslf4japi1.6.6code, which is backwards compatible, would be the only SLF4J version that gets loaded, and would then work for both JARs. Any thoughts Thanks in advance.p

Negative 107680 pThe 8puzzle will be represented by a 3x3 list of lists positions where the empty box will be represented by the value 9, as shown below [[9,1,3],[5,2,6],[4,7,8]]p  pPossibility Solution Only half of the initial positions of the 8puzzle are solvable. There is a formula that allows to know from the beginning if you can solve the puzzle.To determine whether an 8puzzle is solvable, for each square containing a value N is calculated how many numbers less than N there after the current cell. For example, to the initial statusp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comNlBgo.jpg altenter image description herep  ul li1 no numbers less then  0 li liEmpty 9  has to subsequently 3,5,2,6,4,7,8  7 li li3 have  1 to 2 li li5  has subsequently to 2,4  2 li li2 no number under it happen  0 li li6 is subsequently 4  1 li li4 no numbers less then  0 li li7 no minor numbers after  0 li li8 no numbers less then  0li ul  pAfter that, we calculate the Manhattan distance between the position of the empty and position 3.3. For the above example, the empty box is in the position 1.2, so Manhattan distance that is d  abs 31  abs 32  3 Finally, add up all the calculated values.

Negative 107680 pIm new to using namespaces in xml so I am kind of confused and would like some clarification. I have a java service where I am receiving xml documents with many different namespaces and while i got it working, I feel like I must have done something wrong so I want to check. In my packageinfo.java I have my schema annotation such asp  precodejavax.xml.bind.annotation.XmlSchema     xmlns         javax.xml.bind.annotation.XmHSprefixtrain, namespaceURIhttpmycompanytrain,          javax.xml.bind.annotation.XmHSprefixpassenger, namespaceURIhttpmycompanypassenger     ,      elementFormDefault  javax.xml.bind.annotation.XmlNsFormQUALIFIED  codepre  pI have a Train.java annotated on the class level withp  precodeXmlRootElementnameTrain, namespacehttpmycompanytrain codepre  pand each field in the class annotated withp  precodeXmlElementnameColor for example codepre  pTrain contains a List of Passengers so theres a property p  precodeprivate SetltPassengergt passengers codepre  pand this collection is annotated withp  precodeXmlElementWrappernamePassengers XmlElementsXmlElementnamePassenger, namespacehttpmycompanypassenger codepre  pThen within Passenger.java the class itself is annotated withp  precodeXmlElementnamePassenger, namespacehttpmycompanypassenger codepre  pFinally for individual fields within Passenger.java, they are annotated like thisp  precodeXmlElementnameTicketNumber, namespacehttpmycompanypassenger codepre  pSo when I have an xml that looks likep  precodelttrainTraingt    lttrainColorgtRedlttrainColorgt    lttrainPassengersgt        lttrainPassengergt            ltpassengerTicketNumbergtT101ltpassengerTicketNumbergt        lttrainPassengergt    lttrainPassengersgt lttrainTraingt codepre  pNow I unmarshal this xml I received and Trains Color property is set and Passengers TicketNumber property is set. But I dont know why I need to add the namespace url on the XmlElement annotation on TicketNumber for that to work but I didnt need to do so for the Color property on Train. If I remove the namespace attribute from the XmlElement annotation on TicketNumber, the value from the xml wont get mapped to the object unless I also remove the namespace prefix from the xml request. I feel like since Ive got the namespace attribute defined on the XmlRootElement for Passenger, I shouldnt need to do that for every single field in the class as well just like I didnt have to for Train so I am assuming I must have setup something wrong. Can someone point me in the right direction Thanksp

Negative 107680 pWe have developed an app for both iOS and Android that communicates with a server via REST calls. In order for a user to be able to login for the first time to the app, they have to first download the servers SSL certificate via https connection on browser or using openssl, download in DER format and manually load the certificate into a folder on the device by connecting the device to a computer and accessing its storage. The app, at login, will check that folder and if the correct certificate is in there the user will be able to login... Any subsequent logins, the users will not have to load the certificate again.p  pNow I was wondering if there is a way to automate the manual process I outlined above Its a pretty tedious process, especially for a mobile app.p  pFor example, connect to the server and download the certificate straight to the device... but does this kind of method have security risksp  pThanksp

Negative 107680 pMy team is experiencing an issue where when using Nuget for package management it creates references in my project to specific versions of a dll. Is there a way to stop Nuget from creating these tightly coupled referencesp  pA bit of background.p  pWe are using nuget to manage our internal shared libraries. Packages are normally installed using the VS UI. Nuget packages are created using nuget.exe spec and nuget.exe pack on the .csproj file.p  pWe use a standard branching strategy of mainline dev is done on trunk and release off an rc branch.p  pWe didnt want to enter into versioning hell by naming all of our packages x.y.zbuild123 because a dev may need to do a local build away from our CI system and use that to test downstream solutions. Our answer to this was to simplify our package versioning by saying that all trunk builds are simply x.y.zstaging and then an rc build is named x.y.z This would enable a dev to do a local build and with the help of nuget.exe install pointing to a repository on the devs machine use their build in downstream solutions. Without having to update packages etc.p  pThe problem we are seeing is while this works fine at the package level. builds are failing as the references in projects are to specific file versions of an assembly. Which on a local dev build will not include a build number but on the CI server it will.p  pie.p  pA project has a reference something like the following.p  p      p  pThe build number part of the version 123 is different on the CI server to the local dev machine where it is usually 0.p  pIs there any way to get nuget to create version agnostic references eg just the assembly name rather than this almost strong name.p

Negative 107680 pOk heres the problem if you had some trouble understanding the title. Im using a hrefhttpsgithub.comInferisViewDeck relnofollowthisa library here and it is represented by the codeIIViewDeckControllercode.p  pI init it with simple left and center codeUIViewControllerscode p  precodeFTPhoneHomeViewController home  [[FTPhoneHomeViewController alloc] init] FTPhoneSideViewController side  [[FTPhoneSideViewController alloc] init]  IIViewDeckController vdc  [[IIViewDeckController alloc] initWithCenterViewControllerhome leftViewControllerside] [self.delegate changeRootViewControllervdc] codepre  pcodeFTPhoneHomeViewControllercode and codeFTPhoneSideViewControllercode are just subclasses of codeUIViewControllercode. The last line removes the current coderootViewControllercode from the window and adds the codeIIViewDeckControllercode.p  pNow in the codeFTPhoneHomeViewControllercode I add another codeUIViewControllercode with the codeaddChildViewControllercode method p  precodeFTTileViewController tileViewController  [[FTTileViewController alloc] initWithFrameCGRectMake5.0, 50.0, 469.0, 310 tileData[FTTileFaker prepareTileData] defaultTileConfig[FTTileFaker prepareTileConfigs][0] andTileConfigs[FTTileFaker prepareTileConfigs]] tileViewController.tileSpacing  9.0 [self addChildViewControllertileViewController] [self.view addSubviewtileViewController.view] [tileViewController didMoveToParentViewControllerself] codepre  pI did this because this codeFTTileViewControllercode manages a bunch of tiles and from an architectural point of view, this logic is best contained in its own seperate codeUIViewControllercode.p  pWhen I use the codeIIViewDeckControllercode as a coderootViewControllercode from the window, my codeviewWillAppearcode event in the codeFTTileViewControllercode is not called. But it is called in the codeFTPhoneHomeViewControllercode Now when I dont use the codeIIViewDeckControllercode and just add the codeFTPhoneHomeViewControllercode as the coderootViewControllercode of the window, my codeFTTileViewControllercode does get the codeviewWillAppearcode event...p  pMaybe its a bug with the codeIIViewDeckControllercode and I should also post it there. But I dont see what Im doing wrong here. Anyone has any thoughts about thisp  pAnd if anyone could check my general assumption around codeUIViewControllerscode  p  pAdding codechildViewControllerscode to another codeUIViewControllercode is not a requirement to get view cycle methods like codeviewWillAppearcode to be passed onto another codeUIViewControllerscode view. These events are passed when you add another codeUIViewControllerscode view with the codeaddSubviewcode method. But you use the codeaddChildViewControllercode methods for example, to get rotation events and to maintain the codeviewControllerscode hierarchy through your application.p

Negative 107680 pI have been searching for a good example of how to use jqGrid with AngularJS.  I am aware about the ngGrid and other AngularJS supported grid controls but unfortunately I have an overall theme worked out based on the jqGrid.p  pI have recently started Angular, so please excuse my noob ness.p  p1 I can fetch data from my server api inside the controller using http.get. No issues. 2 The jqGrid samples that I have come across all use jquery based ajax calls to fetch the data and bind to the grid. Which I do not want to do unless you experts here tell me that its okay. 3 The other option I thought was to call the controller method on document.load and assign the results to the grid control, and continue with the jqGrid initialisation. But what difference does it make from fetching the data using jquery ajaxp  pThank you very much for all your answers.p

In this example, the Austin branch opens Sunday at 530 pm, closes Monday at 200 am, and then reopens at 830 to work all the way to the next day again until 200 am. On Fridays, they close at 530 pm, have Saturday off and then open again on Sunday to repeat the same cycle.p  pMy question is, could it be possible using a select statement alone to return rows that looks something like thisp  pre LOCATION   DAYOFTHEWEEK   OPENTIME  CLOSETIME     AUSTIN           SUN          1730       null     AUSTIN           MON          null       200 AUSTIN           MON          830        null AUSTIN           TUE          null       200 AUSTIN           TUE          830        null AUSTIN           WED          null       200 AUSTIN           WED          830        null AUSTIN           THU          null       200 AUSTIN           THU          830        null AUSTIN           FRI          null       200 AUSTIN           FRI          830       1730 pre  pnull is just a placeholder, any value like 1, or whatever would work too. Time in this particular case is an int value that represents a time equivalence 200 for 200 am, 1730 for 1730, etcp  pThanksp

Negative 107680 pI mainly work with the CakePHP framework, with the use of the very cool added plugin that minify and groups selected assets into one whole file, therefore making only one HTTP request for the whole site.p  pI am now working with designers, who although want very cool dynamically built sites, do not like losing control over building the CSS  design within Dreamweaver. Although just to add, I will add I think I possible am better with CSS  I am now normally using SCSS  than they are . p  pSo they want to still build in standard CSS and html, I can add things in like backbone to give me router  path management.  Although I have not used it before, so some learning to do there .p  pBut want I really want to know is, if there are any ways I can group  minify assets just using a PHP plugin Or a Node.JS plugin which would just output the files I need it will be a standard web hosting, so no Node.JS support. I think a PHP plugin would be bestp  pAny ideasp  pOr should I look at building one myselfp  pThanks Glenn.p

Negative 107680 pI have a question about design problem caused by JSF2 managed bean scope mechanism request scope. p  pI am building a web app using tabview component and datatable component of primefaces4. Each tab has one datatable with data retrieved from managed bean with request scope, which uses JDBC to get data from database. Therefore, every time user clicks on a tab, the managed bean will retrieve data from database. This is how the whole architecture is designed. Simple enough.p  pThe purpose to use RequestScoped for each ManagedBean is that users want to see real time data from database when they choose each tab each request. All other scopes do not apply. Problem is that all tabs database accesses logic are executed when user chooses one tab. I think that is becaused of Ajax call request, so that every RequestScoped beans are called. p  pThis causes 2 drawbacks  1. bad performance. Users need to wait for 45 seconds to see the datatable appeared after all beans are executed.   2. too much useless access to database.p  pMy solution is to use Spring scheduler to manage all database accesses in seperate threads from managed bean, and then add a data cache layer to interact with managed bean. Spring scheduler may be designed to access database every 10 minutes, poll data and put them into data cache. So that managed bean will access all data in memory. Then I would like to use Primefaces Push API to push data to client side, so user dont need to refresh browser.p  pObviously it is not in real time, but solves 2 problems stated. p  pIs there any other better or simplified solution p  pThanks p  psolutionp  ol lichange ManagedBean to sessionScopedli liadd tabviewListenerli liadd tabview class to handle tab switchli liin tabview class, use method in this post to get managed bean at runtime. br a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions4303912jsf2accessingmanagedbeansinstanceinthephaselistenerobjectJSF 2  Accessing managed bean39s instance in the phase listener objectali liin tabview page, use cachetrue to increase performance, and let tabViewListner to update the whole tabview component which will update datatables inside.li ol

Negative 107680 pIm working on a novelty detection project in Android using background subtraction. I would like to do simple classification after an object is detected e.g. Person, Dog, Car, Motorbike. I have read some literature on how to do this using e.g. Bag Of Words, Cascade classifier, but Im still not sure how to approach the task. Essentially, I want to store the novelty as an image and then label it into some sort of class  like Person, Dog, etc..or even match against a specific person, for example. The number of classes doesnt have to be too large  2 or 3 even. So my questions arep  p1 Whats the bestsimplest approach to do this CascadeBag of Wordsother methods   p  p2 How can I transport this classifier to my Android app, so that after I store the novelty as an image, I can just pass it to the classifier, which then applies a label. I know Cascade classifiers have associated xml files, but is this the only way p  pSorry if the questions seem trivial, but Ive had a difficult time finding literature online. p

Negative 107680 pFirst of all, my question is not about setting the wifi hot spot. I do this easily using codenetshcode. My question is rather about performing communications sockettosocket between the PC and the device.p  pThe android device acts as the server I use a thread where a codeServerSocketcode waits for a connection codeacceptcode then returns a codeSocketcode. It then starts a second thread where I access the streams through an codeInputStreamReadercode and a codePrintWritercode. I read the characters and when its done I send the answer back. I keep the codeSocketcode open as long as I have to keep the communication up.p  pThe PC is programmed in CCLI .NET and acts as the client. Actually, the Android device is the wifi client of the PC hot spot but with my program, it is the inverse the computer has to make requests to the device not the opposite. So I create a codeSocketcode emSocketTypeStream, ProtocolTypeTcpem, maybe Im wrong doing this. Then I connect it. The actual connection works but It can take up to few seconds. Any way, if I have to do it one or two times, it is not a problem. Then I send the request using codeSendcode and get the answer using codeReceivecode.p  pNow, to test the system, I use PuTTY. I connect correctly and the data are sent and received correctly. The problem is that there is a tremendous delay. Lets see an examplep  po Send CONNECTp  pwait up to 5 seconds...p  po Receive OKp  pI would have expected it to be instantaneous. I used the Eclipse debugger to see if the delay occurs in the PCtoDevice part of the communication or in the DevicetoPC part. It seems that it takes about as much time in both directions.p  ol liIs it correct to use a Stream Socket with Tcp protocol PC sideli liAre there some settings somewhere in the sockets or deeper in Android that I could fine tune to make such data exchanges fasterli ol  pI can of course give you more info but I dont know what is relevant and what is not. Feel free to ask for more details.p  pThanks for the help you can give mep

Negative 107680 pIm running in to an issue in that I need to get one value in a cucumber statement, and then give that value to another statement. p  pSpecifically I am getting a JSON object from one page where that object gets sent to an api endpoint as a preference and then using information out of that after I query the api, which happens in a completely separate step. p  pI am suspecting that I have to write the value somewhere, and then pull that value when the step that needs it comes up, but Im kind of at a loss for doing that as well.p  pI can provide any further needed details, thanks for any help p

Negative 107680 pThis image mainly explains my problemp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comgBlxe.jpg altProblemp  pThe frustum.boundsInFrustum method detects the floor as inside of it, however neither the box nor the other one that has the bricky texture gets detected, and the frustum 3d representation does not touch nor contains any of them. Ive tried other locations and objects inside my map and large models behind the frustum far plane often interfere and trigger this problem.p  pThe FrustumCulling test works fine, even if I replace the method sphereInFrustum with boundsInFrustum and if I shorten the frustum lenght in order to get some objects behind the frustum far plane inside the test. strikeI will try replicating the issue in there too by modifying the objects size.strike strikeTried it already, test works flawlessly, something in my code then...strikep  pstrongNOTE FrustumCullingTest uses bullet by default to test if an object is inside another, so it is not applicable to this case.strongp  pstrongEDIT boundsInFrustum in the images scenario told me that there are at least one corner of the floor that are indeed in the inside face of any of the frustums plane, so the method always returns true. I think whats happening here is that if the frustum is smaller than the object and if its pointing at the middle of it, every plane has a point in its inside face.strongp

Negative 107680 pIve seen other posts in this site regarding the same issue and Ive tried the solutions given. Ive also visited the links that may offer a solution but Im still stuck with the same error.p  pIm using DOJO and something as simple as this wont even workp  precode    myStore.newItemid test, otherfield otherinfohere     myStore.save codepre  pSupposedly the newItem was not passed an identity for the new item error appears when you havent provided an identifier for the new item, which i have.  The whole purpose of this Just in case anyone can provide a good idea or has done something similar before is that i want to create a data grid that shows info from a particular store. The problem is, that in that store all the items may not have the same structure. For instancep  pI may have a store that looks like thisp  precodeidentifier id,               label name,               items [                  id1, nameEcuador,           capitalQuito ,                  id2, nameEgypt,             capitalCairo ,                  id3, nameEl Salvador,       capitalSan Salvador , additionalField otherinfohere,                  abbrgq, nameEquatorial Guinea, capitalMalabo, additionalField otherinfohere,         ] codepre  pThis is possible because Im the one constructing the store in a Spring Controller Im also using the Spring Framework from information I have locally stored in a Berkeley DB. So what i need is a data grid with a dynamic layout because I dont want blank spaces to show in the view in the rows with lesser amount of fields, and i need to show all the info in the store at the same time, but i dont know how to do this. I thought of doing it by creating a simple layout of only 1 field. In it I would load data from a store i create dynamically at runtime. The data in the store would be composed of HTML combined with the values coming from the original store so I could obtain something like this, which is inside an attribute of a JavaScript Object and let the browser parse it for mep  precode    ltdivgtltspangtid originalID ltspangt....ltdivgt codepre  pThis of course is a simple example, the html layout im looking for is far more complicated, but i think that passing it as a string to an object might do the trick. The problem is that i dont even know if that idea will work because i get that error whenever i try to add values to my secondary store. p  precoderdb.modules.monitor.historicStore.fetchonComplete functionitems, request             for var i  0 i lt items.length i                 var item  items[i]                 var obj  new Object                             obj.id  rdb.modules.monitor.historicStore.getValueitem, id                 var html  ltdivgtltspangt                 html  rdb.modules.monitor.historicStore.getValueitem, sql                 html  ltspangtltdivgt                 obj.html  html                 myStore.store.newItemobj                                        codepre  pIn this context historicStore refers to the JSON store that has the values that i need to convert and add to myStore after i added some HTML.p  pI hope you got the main idea of what Im trying to do. If anyone can help me we either of these problems i would really appreciate it. Thanks in advance p

Negative 107680 pWe have a file IO library that basically writes data to a file in a fancy format and then later reads the file back.  We must ensure that the file is readable even if the library or computer crashes amidst the middle of writing.p  pWe know how to write a program that crashes itself.  We can use codekillgetpidcode to simulate a crash.  Or we can use code10code and so on.  So well write a program that opens the library, writes some data, and then kills itself right in the middle.  Then wed have a file in its halfbaked state that we can open in the reader to see if the reader can handle the file.p  pThe question how to make this automatedp  pFor example, wed like our unit test suite which tests many aspects of the library automatically and gives a passfail to create a new programprocess that begins writing a file and then commits suicide.  Then control can be handled back to the unit test which can then open the file that the process created before seppuku.  Then the unit test can do some validation on the file to see if weve satisfied our requirment leave a valid file upon crash.  p  pI was looking into the codeexeccode function which seems to do what we need.  However, I was not able to ascertain whether codeexeccode returns back to the caller programprocess if the codeexeccoded program crashes.p

Negative 107680 pThis is my code, which shows a problem for 14 rows of a table view. For one screen, 6 cells are visible. p  pWhen I tapped the 2nd cell, the 10 cell also has a checkmark, tap 3rd then 11th checkmarked, 1st then 9th checkmarked, tap 1st, then 8th also checkmarked...but the grey highlight does not behave like this, only one cell can be highlighted.p  pIf I tap a cell after one is tapped on the the same screen, the one just checkmarked will be cleared for checkmark, which makes sense. However,  if after I tapped one cell and then scroll the tableview lower, I can tap a cell and it shows checkmark as well, i.e. the one just checked on top screen still has a checkmark. So if I scroll up and down, and tap one cell each time after I scroll to the other side, I can put a checkmark for every cell, all checkmarks are shown.p  pIt is really weird, and I have tried a lot of ways to solve it, but seems I have some basic understanding of codeUITableViewcode missing, can anyone figure it out, please Thanks.p  precode UITableViewCell tableViewUITableView tableView cellForRowAtIndexPathNSIndexPath indexPath      static NSString ID UITableViewCell     UITableViewCell cell  [tableView dequeueReusableCellWithIdentifierID]     if cell  nil          cell  [[UITableViewCell alloc] initWithStyleUITableViewCellStyleSubtitle reuseIdentifierID]           cell.imageView.image  [UIImage imageNamedearth.png]      return cell    voidtableViewUITableView tableView didSelectRowAtIndexPathNSIndexPath   indexPath      UITableViewCell cell [tableView cellForRowAtIndexPathindexPath]         cell.accessoryType  UITableViewCellAccessoryCheckmark   voidtableViewUITableView tableView didDeselectRowAtIndexPathNSIndexPath indexPath      UITableViewCell cell [tableView cellForRowAtIndexPathindexPath]     cell.accessoryType  UITableViewCellAccessoryNone  codepre

Negative 107680 pI am trying to split a string of 10 numbers and possibly letters up and place them into an array. I know that the best way to do this is by using the .split function that Java offers. I usually dont have a problem with it. However, I am now having trouble with it in a program I am creating. As seen in the code below, I am trying to split the string at every character. The length of the array should therefore be 10. However, the .split function is counting the beginning of the string as blank space. This is causing a problem with the rest of the program as there is no element in that index of the array. How can I stop this from happeningp  precodeString input  123456789x String[] inputArr  input.split System.out.printlnLength   inputArr.length forint i0iltinputArr.lengthi     System.out.printlninputArr[i]  codepre  pThis code produces the following resultp  pLength 11p  pblank index.

Negative 107680 pIm working on an app that I inherited so sometimes I come across configrelated stuff that I cant solve. Long story short I use rbenv to manage ruby versions on my local machine and recently I was trying to delete one version of Ruby that I dont use and accidentally deleted the one used in my app version is 1.9.3p392.p  pSo I used rbenv to reinstall 1.9.3p392 and ran codebundle installcode in my app directory but got the following errorp  precodeCould not find gem gemnasium gt 0 ruby in the gems available on this machine.  codepre  pI get the same error when running coderails consolecode or coderails servercode. In an attempt to solve the problem I ran codegem install gemnasiumcode and got the following errorp  precodeERROR  Could not find a valid gem gemnasium gt 0 in any repository codepre  p...which makes sense because when I go to e.g. rubygems.org, there is no Gemnasium gem. So then I dont know why codegem gemnasiumcode was in Gemfile to begin with or what its used for.p  pIn an attempt to move on and come back to the problem later, I simply commented out codegem gemnasiumcode in codeGemfilecode. However, doing that has led to the following problem when I try to deploy to Staging with Capistrano when getting to the assets precompile partp  precodeINFO[ce9f38e3] Running bundle exec rake assetsprecompile on http01staging.myapp.com DEBUG[ce9f38e3] Command cd uappsmyappreleases20141126184705 ampamp  RAILSENVstaging bundle exec rake assetsprecompile  DEBUG[ce9f38e3]     rake aborted DEBUG[ce9f38e3]     LoadError cannot load such file  gemnasium uappsmyappsharedbundleruby1.9.1gemsactivesupport3.2.21libactivesupportdependencies.rb251in require uappsmyappsharedbundleruby1.9.1gemsactivesupport3.2.21libactivesupportdependencies.rb251in block in require uappsmyappsharedbundleruby1.9.1gemsactivesupport3.2.21libactivesupportdependencies.rb236in loaddependency uappsmyappsharedbundleruby1.9.1gemsactivesupport3.2.21libactivesupportdependencies.rb251in require uappsmyappreleases20141126184705libtasksgemnasium.rake2in block in lttop requiredgt uappsmyappreleases20141126184705libtasksgemnasium.rake1in lttop requiredgt  codepre  pSo...basically I have no idea why Gemnasium is in here to begin with or how to get it back into my Gemfile successfully.

Negative 107680 pI use GDB to debug an embedded linux target board. On target board gdbserver is running the stripped binary application. On PC side I run application which has debug symbols attached.p  pFrom PC via ethernet connection I do target remote ipport and there is a healthy connection to gdbserver. I add break points in some functions and continue. Debugger successfully break as expected when I trigger external event and program breaks in my simple function.

Each time I do next or step this continues. There is no loops or jumps, code should just go line by line but it doesnt. Why GDB behaves like this What should I do to solve this problem.p

Negative 107680 pI am working on an embedded system that involves collecting data from multiple camera modules over USB. The plan was originally to use a small Linux system, but the Linux drivers for the camera dont support using any of its features hardware triggering, shooting raw, certain pixel formats, etc. There is a nice C SDK provided by the manufacturer and everything just works on Windows. We are now investigating using a small Windows system like the new Intel Compute Stick or a Liva. p  pI want to write software to collect the data from the cameras as they are hardware triggered by another part of the system, and write the data to a removable disk. It should be remotely controllable via TCPIP hard wire. This sounds like something that would fit within the purview of a windows service. Would this be a good way to gop  pIm mostly concerned about running into securitypermissions issues. Ive been reading things that indicate that services are contained within noninteractive window stations, and Im not sure what that means in terms of being able to access devices etc. The machine running all this is going to be completely headless, so it just has to work all the time. Im continuing to do my own research into the right thing to do here, but if somebody with relevant experience could give me a suggestion yes or no along with a good reason why, that would help me out greatly. p

Negative 107680 pI need to run a logistic regression on a relatively large data frame with 480.000 entries with 3 fixed effect variables. Fixed effect var A has 3233 levels, var B has 2326 levels, var C has 811 levels. So all in all I have 6370 fixed effects. The data is crosssectional. If I cant run this regression using the normal glm function because the regression matrix seems too large for my memory I get the message Error cannot allocate vector of size 22.9 Gb. I am looking for alternative ways to run this regression on my Macbook Air OS X 10.9.5 8GB RAM. I also have access to a server with 16GB RAM.p  pI have tried solving the issue in a few different ways but so far none led to satisfactory resultsp  pstronglfefelmstrong  Using the felm regression function of the a hrefhttpcran.rproject.orgwebpackageslfelfe.pdf relnofollowlfe packagea that subtracts fixed effects before running the regression. This works perfectly and allowed my to run the above regression as a normal linear model in just a few minutes. However, lfe does not support logistic regressions and glms. So felm was great for getting an idea about model fit for different models but doesnt work for the final logistic regression models.p  pstrongbiglmbigglmstrong  I thought about using a hrefhttpcran.rproject.orgwebpackagesbiglmbiglm.pdf relnofollowbigglma to break my function into more manageable chunks. However, several sources e.g. a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions10502882rbiglmwithcategoricalvariableslink1a, a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions24317418modelrunwithglmbutnotbigglmlink2a, a hrefhttpblog.revolutionanalytics.com201405quickhistory2glmsrandlargedatasets.html relnofollowlink3a mention that in order for that to work, factor levels need be consistent across chunks, i.e. each chunk must contain at least one of each factor of each factor variable. Factor A and B contain levels that only appear once, so I cant split the sets into different chunks with consistent levels. If I delete 10 factors of fixed effect A and 8 factors of B a minor change I will only have factors with 4 levels left, and splitting my data into 4 chunks will make it a lot more manageable already. However, then I still need to figure out how to sort my df in a way that will ensure that my 480.000 entries are sorted into 4 chunks in which each factor level of each of the 3 factors appearing at least once.p  pstrongGlmmGSglmgsstrong The a hrefhttpcran.rproject.orgwebpackagesglmmGSglmmGS.pdf relnofollowglmmgsa function in the package with the same name performs a fixedeffects subtraction like the lfe package for logistic regressions using a GaussSeidel Algorithm. Unfortunately, the package is no longer being developed. Being relatively new to R and having no deep experience with statistics I cant make sense of the output and have no idea of how to transform it in a way that would give me the normal effect size, model fit, significance interval indicators that glm regression summaries provide.p  pI sent a message to the packages authors. They kindly responded as followsp  blockquote   pThe package provides no output in the same format of a glm object. However, you   can easily calculate most of the fit statistics standard error of the   estimates, goodness of fit given the current output in the CRAN   version, I believe that the current output is a vector of estimate of   coefficients, and the associated vector of standard errors same for   the covariance components, but you need not worry about them if you   are fitting model without random effects. Only beware that the   covariance matrices used to calculated the standard errors are the   inverse of the diagonal blocks of the precision matrix associated with   the GaussSeidel algorithm, and so they tend to underestimate the   standard errors of the joint likelihood. I am not maintaining the   package any longer and I do not have time to get into the specific   details the seminal theory behind the package can be found in the   a hrefhttpwww.stat.missouri.eduguhasugaussseidel.pdf relnofollowpaper referenced in the manuala, everything else needs to be worked out   by you with pen and paper .p blockquote  pIf anyone can explain how to easily calculate most of the fit statistics in a way that someone without any education in statistics can understand it might be impossible or provide R code that shows on example of how this could be done I would be much obligedp  pstrongRevolution Analyticsstrong I installed revolution analytics enterprise on a virtual machine that simulates Windows 7 on my Mac. The program has a function called RxLogit that is optimized for large logistic regressions. Using the RxLogit function I get the error Failed to allocate 326554568 bytes. Error in rxCallRxLogit, params  bad allocation, so that function also seems too run into memory issues. However, the software enables me to run my regression on a distributed computing cluster. So I could just kill the problem by purchasing computing time on a cluster with lots of memory. However, I wonder if the revolution analytics program provides any formulas or methods that I dont know off that would allow me to do some kind of lfelike fixedeffects subtraction operation or bigglmlike chunking operation that takes factors into account.p  pstrongMatrixModelsglm4strong One person suggested I use the glm4 function of the MatrixModels package with the sparse  TRUE attribute to speed up calculation. If I run a glm4 regression with all fixed effects I get an Error in Choleskycrossprodfrom, LDL  FALSE     internalchmfactor Cholesky factorization failed error. If I run it only with the fixed effect variables B OR A and C, the calculation works and returns a glpModel object. As with glmmGS I have some issues in turning that output into a form that makes sense to me since the standard summary method does not seem to work on it.p  pI would be happy for advice on any of the issues mentioned above or also completely different approaches for running logistic regressions with multiple large fixed effects in R with memory constraints.p

Negative 107680 pI am currently working on a particular task that is based in Genetics but is mostly a regexscripting problem. I am trying to identify and ultimately omit all lines of a tabdelimited file where the entry in a named subfield in a semicolondelimited column satisfies a certain condition. Ultimately, I am looking for basepair sequences that consist of a short subsequence repeated for the length of the string. Just to give an impression of the kind of thing I am talking about since a wall of text isnt as permeable as an example, here are a couple of cases I might consider, with incidental metacontext simplified for the purposes of the illustrationp  precodeA    1     FOOBLAHBARBLAHFIELDAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA   should match this  B    2     FOOBLAHBARBLAH  not all records have this subfield these should not be filtered out  C    3     FOOBLAHBARBLAHFIELDCATCATCATCATCATCAT  this should also be matched  D    4     FOOBLAHBARBLAHFIELDATACGGGGGCCATCG  the GGGGG in the middle should not count this line should not be matched  E    5     FOOBLAHBARBLAHFIELDCTTTCTTTCTTTCTTTCTTTCTT  this should be matched, because the sequence is repeated throughout the string, even if it is truncated  E    6     FOOBLAHBARBLAHFIELDCTTTCTTTCTTTCTTTCTTTAG  this should not be matched, because unlike E5 the trailing sequence is not a truncated version of the repeating sequence  codepre  pI currently have a simple expression in codesedcode that behaves correctly for lines A1 through D4, but doesnt get E5 right but therefore gets E6 rightp  precodesed r FIELD.1,414,d codepre  pFor the moment I am only looking for repeated sequences where the words are 14 letters long, with at least 4 repetitions following the initial occurrence at the beginning of the string. I dont know enough regex voodoo to know how to do this, or whether this is beyond the capabilities of regex alone and would need a proper scripting language to tackle. As far as I can tell, the question boils down to, how can I write a regex expression that allows a partial match on a backref only on the tail of a sequence of repetitions, but I wanted to avoid boiling down the exact details to a possibly misleading synopsis, and provide the full details so that anyone who has experience with an identical problem in another or the same field of study can better recognize it.p  h1EDITh1  pI came up with a solution that seems to work pretty well, which I wrote in AWK and mostly avoided using regexes for.p  precodefunction testrseq, maxlen, minrep      len  lengthseq     for i  1 i ltmaxlen i      reps  intleni  1     if reps lt minrep  return 0      x  substrseq, 1, i     y  substrseq, i1, ireps     z  substrseq, ireps11     str     b0     for j1 j lt reps j          str  str x         if str  substry, 1, ij              b1             break                   if b  continue      if x  z ampamp gsub[[alpha]], , z0          return 1               return 0  codepre  pThis function loops through the acceptable wordlengths 1 through maxlen and tests whether the string is built out of words of that length, by capturing the first word, the concatenation of all full words, and the truncated endword if there is any in separate strings it then concatenates the first word to itself and incrementally compares it to the fullword string, breaking and continuing if it ever doesnt match after that it tests to see whether the final word which might be empty matches the complete word, by using a fixed regex comparison, followed by a test to make sure that it wasnt matching on any characters with special regex meaning by seeing if there were any nonalphabetic characters in the string this test could be replaced by seeing whether the last word is either empty or equal to the leftjustified substring of the full word of its own length. Capturing the field itself is left up to the main loop of the AWK script, which is simple enough. This question is still open to all answers, so feel free to post your own approach to this.p  pI didnt want to overload this with testcases initially, as that would detract from the clarity, but I am including cases to consider below, along with the matches Y and nonmatches N according to this scriptp  precodeNAAAAAABBBBBAAA YAAAAA YAAAA NAAA YBABABABABABA YBABABABABAB YBABABABABA YBABABABA YABCABCABCABCABCABC YABCABCABCABCABCAB YABCABCABCABCABCA NABCABCABCABCABCAD NABCABCABCABCABCA. YABCDABCDABCDABCDABC YABCDABCDABCDABCDAB YABCDABCDABCDABCDA NABCDEABCDEABCDEABCDEABCDE NABCDEABCDEABCDEABCDEABCD codepre  pJust to make testing easier, you can replace FIELD with . in the test, and if you get all lines with Y and no lines with N, your approach and mine are close enough for this case, I limited the search to words of length 14, with at least 3 repetitions i.e. at least four full matches.p

How could I fix thisp  pEdit I remade the controller and the view based on comments you gave me Thats how it looks now, but seems my Answer List to be Empty again.p  pViewModel p  precode public class ViewModel      public IEnumerableltAnswergt Answers  get set      public Question Question  get set   codepre  pController p  precode[Authorize]         public ActionResult Create                      ViewModel vm  new ViewModel             ViewBag.BelongToTest  new SelectListdb.Tests, TestId , TestTitle.FirstOrDefault             vm.Question   new Question  QuestionText  String.Empty              vm.Answers  new ListltAnswergt  new Answer  CorrectOrNot  false, AnswerText  , OpenAnswerText                 return Viewvm                             POST QuestionCreate          [HttpPost]         [Authorize]         public ActionResult CreateViewModel vm                           if ModelState.IsValid                                      vm.Question.BelongToTest  from t in db.Tests                                              join m in db.Members on t.AddedByUser equals m.MemberId                                              where m.UserID  WebSecurity.CurrentUserId ampamp                                              t.AddedByUser  m.MemberId                                              orderby t.TestId descending                                              select t.TestId.FirstOrDefault                      db.Questions.Addvm.Question                     db.SaveChanges                      if vm.Answers  null                                              foreach var i in vm.Answers                                                      i.BelongToQuestion  vm.Question.QuestionId                              db.Answers.Addi                                                                    db.SaveChanges                     ViewBag.Message  Data successfully saved                     ModelState.Clear                                    ViewBag.BelongToTest  new SelectListdb.Tests, TestId, TestTitle, vm.Question.BelongToTest                 vm.Question  new Question  QuestionText  String.Empty                  vm.Answers  new ListltAnswergt  new Answer  CorrectOrNot  false, AnswerText  , OpenAnswerText                     return ViewCreate , vm           codepre  pView p  precodemodel MvcTestApplication.Models.ViewModel using MvcTestApplication.Models  ltscript srchttpajax.googleapis.comajaxlibsjquery1.11.2jquery.min.jsgtltscriptgt       ViewBag.Title  Create   using Html.BeginFormCreate, Question, FormMethod.Post   lth2gtCreatelth2gt  lttablegt     lttrgt         ltthgtQuestion Nameltthgt     lttrgt          lttrgt             lttdgtHtml.EditorFormodelgtmodel.Question.QuestionTextlttdgt         lttrgt  lttablegt  lttable iddataTablegt     lttrgt         ltthgtCorrectltthgt         ltthgtAnswer textltthgt         ltthgtOpen Answerltthgt     lttrgt    foreachvar i in Model.Answers      lttrgt          lttdgtHtml.CheckBoxFormodelgti.CorrectOrNotlttdgt          lttdgtHtml.EditorFormodelgti.AnswerTextlttdgt          lttdgtHtml.EditorFormodelgti.OpenAnswerTextlttdgt     lttrgt  lttablegt  ltinput typebutton idaddNew valueAdd Answergt ltinput typesubmit valueCreate gt    section Scripts      Scripts.Renderbundlesjqueryval      ltscript langjavascriptgt         document.readyfunction                1.

Negative 107680 pI thought Id have a go at building an ipad app using swift.

Strangely enough, I hadnt changed any functionality of the class. Comparing an old, working version with my new one, the only difference was that some of my fields were made codeprivatecode and codereadonlycode. Besides that, the codestring pathcode was changed to codeconstcode. And to my complete bewilderment, changing this back to codereadonlycode fixed the issue I was having.p  pSo my question is How on earth is this possible As far as Im aware, there shouldnt functionally be any difference between readonly and const in this situation.p  pWhen debugging, the change in behavior is substantial, especially in the codeRuncode method. What strongshouldstrong happen here is that once codeLogqueue.Dequeuecode has been called, the thread will leave the codelockcode statement and iterate through the codewhile isRunningcode loop again. This seems pretty obvious, right However, when I change the codestring pathcode to codeconstcode and debug again, the codeLogqueue.Dequeuecode is passed once and a single statement can be found in the log file, after which it simply doesnt do anything else ever again. It doesnt come past codewhile isRunningcode again and it doesnt seem to leave the codelock objcode block. The logger thread seems to simply shutdown or pause after successfully calling codeLogqueue.Dequeuecode once.p  pActually throwing the exception in the codeLogcode method makes no difference, no exceptions are thrown because the logging itself works fine.p  pI should mention that Im using this code with Unity3D 5, which uses Mono. But still, this drastic change in behavior by such a small edit seems impossible to me. Can anyone explain why this is happeningp  pThanksp

Is there a way to refrain from plotting those values by calling them NaN in the corresponding position in the array p  pHere is what I have tried so farp  precodeimport numpy as np from matplotlib import pyplot as plt from mpltoolkits.mplot3d import Axes3D import pylab from matplotlib import cm  Z levels  energ  np.array[0,3.5,1,0.3,1.5,2,3.4,4.8] function for getting x,y associated z values def funx,y,array      return array[x]  arrays for grid x  np.arange0,7,0.5 y  np.arange0,7,0.5   create grid X, Y  np.meshgridx,y zs  np.array[funx,y,energ for x in zipnp.ravelX] Z  zs.reshapeX.shape  plt3d  plt.figure.gcaprojection3d  gradients now with respect to x and y, but ideally with respect to z only Gx, Gz  np.gradientX  Y   G  Gx  2  Gz  2  .5   gradient magnitude N  G  G.max   normalize 0..1  plt3d.plotsurfaceX, Y, Z, rstride1, cstride1,                facecolorscm.jetN, edgecolork, linewidth0, antialiasedFalse, shadeFalse plt.show codepre  pI cannot post image here of this plot but if you run the code you will see it But I would like to not plot certain x,y pairs, so the figure should triangle downward to the minimum.

Negative 107680 pI have different .txt files which I frequently have to import on the same sheet on excel. The problem I am having is that after I manually adjust the width of the columns, and then import a new .txt file, the size of the columns go back to the original size. Is there a way to lock the column width after adjusting it to the desired size. I did use the Protect Sheets option, which enabled me to still edit the sheetas I checked all the boxes except Format Column and Format Row but it didnt allow me to import any more .txt files. p

Negative 107680 pYes, Ive read the other posts on stackoverflow about comparing NSNumber and none of them seem to quite address this particular situation.br This solution was particularly bad ... a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions9219935nsnumbercomparereturningdifferentresultsrq1NSNumber compare returning different resultsabr Because the suggested solution doesnt work at all. Using absvalue1  value2 lt tolerance is flawed from the start because fractional values are stripped off, making the tolerance irrelevant.p  pAnd from Apple documentation... NSNumber explicitly doesnt guarantee that the returned type will match the method used to create it.  In other words, if youre given an NSNumber, you have no way of determining whether it contains a float, double, int, bool, or whatever.p  pAlso, as best I can tell, NSNumber isEqualToNumber is an untrustworthy method to compare two NSNumbers.p  pSo given these definitions...p  precodeNSNumber float1  [NSNumber numberWithFloat1.00001] NSNumber double1  [NSNumber numberWithDouble1.00001] codepre  pIf you run the debugger and then do 2 comparisons of these identical numbers using , one fails, and the other does not.p  precodep [double1 floatValue]  [float1 floatValue]    returns true p [double1 doubleValue]  [float1 doubleValue]    returns false codepre  pIf you compare them using isEqualToNumberp  precodep [float1 isEqualToNumberdouble1]              returns false codepre  pSo if isEqualToNumber is going to return false, given that the creation of an NSNumber is a black box that may give you some other type on the way out, Im not sure what good that method is.p  pSo if youre going to make a test for dirty, because an existing value has been changed to a new value... whats the simplest way to do that that will handle all NSNumber comparisons.. not just float and double, but all NSNumbersp  pIt seems that converting to a string value, then compariing would be most useful, or perhaps a whole lot of extra code using NSNumberFormatter.  p  pWhat are your thoughtsp

Negative 107680 pI am working with a system that sends me webhooks anytime a resource in that system changes. The webhook contains the id of the resource that was updated. For example, if someone edits product ID 1234 in this system, my server will receive an alert saying that product 1234 has changed.  Then I make a request to their API to fetch the newest data for product 1234 and save it to my system.p  pI am building this process to work asynchronously. Meaning, every time I receive a webhook, I save the details to a database table that logs the ID of the resource.  I then have a codeWebhookQueuecode class that contains a coderuncode method, which processes all of the queued requests and updates the appropriate products.

Essentially theres just a line of difference in both the codes indicated belowp  precodesieve lt functionn sq.n lt sqrtn vec lt 2n primes lt rep0, timessq.n i lt 1 while is.naprimes[i] lt sq.n ampamp primes[i] lt sq.n      primes[i] lt vec[1]     vec lt vec[whichvecprimes[i]  0]  This keeps all the numbers not divisible by       the prime in question     i lt i  1  returncprimes[whichprimes0], vec  codepre  pCurious about efficiency, a google search yielded the following code  p  precodegetPrimeNumTilln lt functionn  a lt c2n l lt 2 r lt c while ll lt n      r lt cr,a[1]     a lt a[whicha  l 0]  This removes all the numbers which are       divisible by the prime in question     l lt a[1]  cr,a  codepre  pBoth solutions work okay.

Negative 107680 pContext An existing system that is heavily based on passing XML around in various forms XmlDocument, XDocumentXElement, string encoded. We are developing a new component that will talk to the existing system and will have its own data store of some kind for holding XML for later processing. MongoDB seems like a good fit for the data store but it doesnt have native support for XML, so Im wondering what good options exist for handling XML in MongoDB. p  pThere are two options that come to mindp  pstrong1. Use an XML to JSON converter for conversion in both directionsstrongp  pI believe this will allow querying of the data and the creation on MongoDB indexes. There isnt an immediate need to do lots of querying or lots of different types of querying, but we would at the very least have to do some key based retrieval and maybe one or two queries on the values would be useful certainly useful to keep that option open.p  pIs a generic XML2JSON converter a good fit here, or would a MongoDBBSON converter be betterp  pAre there any specific downsides to converting to JSONBSON Could it ever result in loss of information, perhaps whitespace in blocks of element space could get mangledp  pstrong2. String or binary encode the XML and store it as a BSON byte array.strongp  pProsp  ul liSimple.li ul  pConsp  ul liData becomes opaque to querying.li ul  pAre there additional proscons to the above two options Are there other options available Is this sane e.g. is there a better fit for this problem than MongoDBp  pstrong UPDATE strongp  pA working demo that uses Newtonsoft.Json for the XML to JSON conversion...p  precodeXElement fooElem  XElement.Loadfoo.xml  Note. I used Formatting.Indented to make the JSON easily readable for debug purposes, otherwise it just adds unnecessary whitespace characters. string jsonStr  JsonConvert.SerializeXNodefooElem, Formatting.Indented BsonDocument bsonDoc  BsonDocument.ParsejsonStr codepre  pFrom there you can just call MongoDB as usual, e.g.p  precodeawait collection.InsertOneAsyncbsonDoc codepre  pThis is probably an OKacceptable solution in my particular case, but more generally it has the overhead of converting to and then parsing a JSON string, which is unnecessary work. Ideally we would go from XElement direct to a BsonDocument.p

Negative 107680 pIm trying to retrieve an entire object from a Parse database, but this is not a Parsespecific problem.

Negative 107680 pI have gone through several pages that explain about loop invariant.

Negative 107680 pI got an old website on a webserver. It is to big and not structured well enough but needs to be improved by e.g. Account management. As it is in my opinion at its end of lifetime, we do not want to put more effort in it but instead migrate to new technology. For that, we want to use node.js and AngularJS, because the whole project is more a webapp than it was at the beginning. As a migration concept, we want to include the old stuff via a kind of routing through the node.js server and replace it step by step. For that I looked into the request library without getting the right grip. Goal is, to route some requests after authorization check to the old server, without leaving the new server gate. For that I need to check and parse the gets and posts. Some other requests have to response by the node.js server itself. As I think that I am not the only one with that approach I am asking for experience in that matter.p

If so, then go get the Guid.p  pThere is like 20 Guids I need to do this with.p  pThe way I am doing it at the minute is I have a single class file with all the Guids as codeGuid.Emptycode.p  pThe first time the system goes to get the Guid it will see that it is codeGuid.Emptycode and so it gets the correct Guid from the database and assigns it.  All subsequent calls to get the same Guid will mean they can get it without calling the database.p  pBut is that the correct  best wayp
