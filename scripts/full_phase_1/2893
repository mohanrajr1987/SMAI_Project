Positive 2893 pSetup Spring application deployed on Weblogic 12c, using JNDI lookup to get a datasource to the Oracle Database.p  pWe have multiple services which will be polling the database regularly for new jobs. In order to prevent two services picking the same job we are using a native codeSELECT FOR UPDATEcode query in a CrudRepository. The application then takes the resulting job and updates it to codePROCESSINGcode instead of codeWAITINGcode using the codeCrusRepository.savecode method.p  pThe problem is that I cant seem to get the codesavecode to work within the codeFOR UPDATEcode transaction at least this is my current working theory of what goes wrong, and as a result the entire polling freezes until the default 10 minute timeout occurs. I have tried putting codeTransactionalcode with various propagation flags basically everywhere, but Im not able to get it to work codeEnableTransactionManagementcode is activated and working.p  pObviously there must be some basic knowledge Im missing. Is this even a possible setup Unfortunately, just using codeTransactionalcode with a nonnative CrudRepository codeSELECTcode query is not possible, as it apparently first makes a codeSELECTcode to see if the row is locked or not, and only emthenem makes a new codeSELECTcode that locks it. Another service could very well pick up the same job in the meanwhile, which is why we need it to lock immediately.p  hr  pUpdate in relation to M. Deinums comment. I should perhaps also mention that its a setup wherein the central component thats doing the polling is a library used by all the other services therefore the library has SpringBootApplication, as does each service using it, so double component scanning is certainly present. Furthermore, the service has two separate classes for polling depending on the type of service, with a lot of common code, shared in an AbstractTransactionHelper class.

The response MUST include a WWWAuthenticate header field section 14.46 containing a challenge applicable to the requested resource.

If the request already included Authorization credentials, then the 401 response indicates that authorization has been refused for those credentials. If the 401 response contains the same challenge as the prior response, and the user agent has already attempted authentication at least once, then the user SHOULD be presented the entity that was given in the response, since that entity MAY include relevant diagnostic information. HTTP access authentication is explained in section 11.p  hr  pAlthough, Im able to login to weblogic and em with same credential.

Positive 2893 pI have some issues with setting an clustered environment for weblogic and Apache. The structure is like this 1 webserver that proxies requests to a clustered environment of 3 weblogic servers.p  pEverytime i send the request to the apache server , the request gets unhandled. I figured out a part of the problem , but that is something that is not intended in production. whenever i add emDynamicServerList Onem the requests fail. When i switch it to off it works, but that means whenever a server fails , apache will still send requests to that server and user experience would be 0. p  pstrongEDIT 1strong I am using weblogic 12c and apache2.4 for Centos 7p  pstrongEDIT 2strong There is no firewall nor selinux active p  pHere is my config file for weblogic pluginp  precode ltVirtualHost 8080gt           ServerAdmin postmasterwebserver2           ServerName webserver2          DocumentRoot varwwwwebserver2htdocs          ErrorLog varloghttpdwebservererrorlog          CustomLog varloghttpdwebserveraccesslog forwarded          ltDirectory gt                  AllowOverride all                  Order allow,deny                  Allow from all          ltDirectorygt          DirectoryIndex index.html          ltLocation gt         SetHandler weblogichandler         ltLocationgt     ltIfModule modweblogic.cgt              WeblogicCluster 192.168.166.708001,192.168.166.718001,192.168.166.698001          ConnectTimeoutSecs 15          ConnectRetrySecs 10          WLIOTimeoutSecs 600          DynamicServerList ON          Idempotent ON          FileCaching ON          KeepAliveSecs 60          KeepAliveEnabled ON          DebugConfigInfo ON          ltIfModulegt   ltVirtualHostgt  codepre  pAnd the errors I get are the followingp  blockquote   p[Mon Sep 14 095458.480616 2015] [weblogicerror] [pid 15343tid   140547949991680] [client 172.18.132.5057991] lt1534314422136982   parseJVMID could not resolve hostname 1062689209.

Positive 2893 pWe are running performance tests on a web app deployed to a WLS cluster, taking periodic JFR recordings. We are analyzing the recordings using JMC.p  pAll recordings show ANTLR classes consuming more than 50 of the CPU or more, depending on the performance tests load.p  pInvestigating, we found a diagnostic module that had a log parser rule deployed to the entire cluster. Probably left there from a previous troubleshooting session. We have disabled the rule and took recordings again. ANTLR is still there. p  pThen we stopped the tests, restarted the servers and took recordings again. ANTLR went away.p  pThat may show that the ANTLR classes are used by the diagnostic module indeed, and it takes a server restart the to disable them documentation says restart not required.p  pTo confirm, we enabled the diagnostic module again, without and then with server restarts. The app is still deployed, but we didnt start the performance tests. ANTLR no longer shows up no matter what we tried.p  pLooks like it was not used by the Diagnostics Module after all.p  pThe app itself is NOT using ANTLR and does no log parsing.p  pWhat component in WLS or in JDK can be using ANTLR It is causing a considerable load on the servers, skewing our performance tests.p

Positive 2893 pI have a webapplication on weblogic server that gets JMS messages in many threads from foreign JMS server and updates X entity update X set Y  1 where id  Z. There a distributed transaction for this use case, as my webapp, foreign server are different weblogic servers and has their own databases. p  pAt the same time user cannot login to application because during login the same  update X set Y  1 where id  Z lt must be made. p  pStrange thing is that we dont lock the X table from code we dont have select for update, the X table is not locked in database our db guys says so, so I guess there is only optimistic locking, as we use hibernate.  Somehow the distributed transaction keeps lock on the row in X table but I cant find any information about this, the below Exception is all I have.p  pI dont like that someone programmed the same update inside JMS listener in distribited transaction and during logging synchronous. In JMS listener could it be a a message sent to another JMS queue  p  pHow to solve thisp  precode  could not execute update query SQL [update X set Y  1 where id   Z] nested exception is org.hibernate .exception.SQLGrammarException  could not execute update query Caused by  org.springframework.dao.InvalidDataAccessResourceUsageException could  not execute update query SQL [update X set Y  1 where id  Z]  nested exception is org.hibernate.exception.SQLGrammarException could  not execute update query java.sql.SQLSyntaxErrorException ORA02049  timeout distributed transaction waiting for lock codepre

My guess for probable root cause till now is the load balanced URL but still I am not able to see any technical reason on why load balanced URL could be issue because my machine will open a socket and close it after read timeout.p  pI have placed loggers in codeCustomClientHttpRequestFactorycode and verified that correct values are being used but in the end somehow read timeout is not working as expected.p  pstrongCustomClientHttpRequestFactory.javastrongp  precodepublic class CustomClientHttpRequestFactory extends SimpleClientHttpRequestFactory      private Log logger  LogFactory.getLogCustomClientHttpRequestFactory.class      ValuehttpRequest.readTimeoutInMilliseconds     private Integer httpRequestTimeout      ValuehttpRequest.connectionTimeoutInMilliseconds     private Integer httpReadTimeout      ValueXYZ.httpRequest.readTimeoutInMilliseconds     private Integer XYZHttpRequestTimeout      ValueXYZ.httpRequest.connectionTimeoutInMilliseconds     private Integer XYZHttpReadTimeout      Valuesgw.XYZHttp.service.url     private String XYZSystemUrl              Overriding the default and setting a separate read timeout and HTTP connection timeout values for XYZ transactions.              param uri           public void setTimeoutPropertiesURI uri         boolean isXYZTransaction  isXYZTransactionuri         Integer connectionTimeout  isXYZTransaction  XYZHttpRequestTimeout  httpRequestTimeout         Integer readTimeout  isXYZTransaction  XYZHttpReadTimeout  httpReadTimeout         logger.infoSetting   connectionTimeout      readTimeout         this.setReadTimeoutreadTimeout         this.setConnectTimeoutconnectionTimeout           private boolean isXYZTransactionURI uri         try              URI XYZUrl  new URIXYZSystemUrl             logger.info XYZ Debug             logger.infoXYZHttpRequestTimeout    XYZHttpRequestTimeout             logger.infoXYZHttpReadTimeout    XYZHttpReadTimeout             return XYZUrl.equalsuri          catch Exception e               TODO Autogenerated catch block             e.printStackTrace                  return false       codepre  pstrongHttpDaoImplstrongp  precode    CustomClientHttpRequestFactory httpRequestFactory  CustomClientHttpRequestFactory myAppUtils.getApplicationContext.getBeanhttpRequestFactory     httpRequestFactory.setTimeoutPropertieslUri     restTemplate.setRequestFactoryhttpRequestFactory     responseString  restTemplate.postForObjectlUri, requestString, String.class codepre  pstrongXML configstrongp  precodeltbean idhttpRequestFactory classcom.abc.xyz.customComponents.CustomClientHttpRequestFactory scopeprototypegt  ltbean idrestTemplate classorg.springframework.web.client.RestTemplategt     ltproperty namemessageConvertersgt         ltlistgt             ltbean classorg.springframework.http.converter.StringHttpMessageConvertergt                 ltproperty name  supportedMediaTypesgt                     ltlistgt                         ltvaluegttextxmlcharsetUTF8ltvaluegt                     ltlistgt                 ltpropertygt             ltbeangt         ltlistgt     ltpropertygt ltbeangt codepre

Negative 2893 pI want to create a really easy to use 2D Grid. Each cell in the grid needs to be able to store a load of data. Ideally I would like to be able to traverse through the grid one cell at a time, as well as obtain the immediate neighbours of any of the grid cells.p  pMy first thought was to store a vector of pointers to a Cells neighbours 4 in total, then create convenience functions for leftNeighbour, rightNeighbour, etc. Connecting up the grid after initialization.p  pThe stdvector is supposed to be a dynamically resizeable array, so this strikes me as rather unnecessary if Im only going to hardcode the positions of the pointers 0  left, 1  right, etc. However, it does allow a nicer way of iterating through the neighbours of a cell. The other thing I have to consider is if the cell is on a border with the edge of the grid whether to test for this or just implicitly extend the grid by one cell so that this will never happen.p  pCan anyone suggest a better alternative, or does this sound like a reasonable designp  pThanks, Danp

Negative 2893 pIm planning on making a distributed database system using a a hrefhttpen.wikipedia.orgwikiShared5Fnothing5Farchitecturesharednothing architecturea and a hrefhttpen.wikipedia.orgwikiMultiversion5Fconcurrency5Fcontrolmultiversion concurrency controla. Redundancy will be achieved through a hrefhttpwww.webopedia.comTERMAasynchronous5Freplication.htmlasynchronous replicationa its allowed to lose some recent changes in case of a failure, as long as the data in the system remains consistent. For each database entry, one node has the master copy only that node has write access to it, in addition to which one or more nodes have secondary copies of the entry for scalability and redundancy purposes the secondary copies are readonly. When the master copy of an entry is updated, it is timestamped and sent asynchronously to nodes with secondary copies so that finally they will get the latest version of the entry. The node that has the master copy can change at any time  if another node needs to write that entry, it will request the current owner of the master copy to give that node the ownership of that entrys master copy, and after receiving ownership that node can write the entry all transactions and writes are local.p  pLately Ive been thinking about what to do when a node in the cluster goes down, that what strategy to use for failover. Here are some questions. I hope that you would know available alternatives to at least some of them.p  ul liWhat algorithms there are for doing failover in a distributed systemli liWhat algorithms there are for consensus in a distributed systemli liHow should the nodes in the cluster determine that a node is downli liHow should the nodes determine that what database entries had their master copy on the failed node at the time of failure, so that other nodes may recover those entriesli liHow to decide that which nodes has the latest secondary copy of some entryli liHow to decide that which nodes secondary copy should be promoted to be the new master copyli liHow to handle it, if the node which was though to be down, suddenly comes back as if nothing happenedli liHow to avoid splitbrain scenarios, where the network is temporarily split into two, and both sides think that the other side has diedli ul

Negative 2893 pI have for the most part successfully embedded firefoxxulrunner into our c application, but it is not without troubles. Once in a great while a AccessViolationException will be thrown which I believe is caused by the GC moving a managed object in memory and the unmanaged xpcom attempts to use it after it has been moved. For example I created a protocol handler for a custom protocol that implements some interfaces that firefoxxulrunner calls upon. After doing that, the AccessViolationExceptions became much more predominate. I looked into GCHandle.Allocobject, GCHandleType.Pinned as a possible solution, but couldnt find enough information on how to write a custom marshaller to make my class that implemented the interfaces blittable. So does anyone have any ideas on how to deal with this problem or how to translate my class into a blittable one Also its near impossible to track down what parts of the interop are causing the AccessViolationException.

In RT the department is stored as a CustomField, and my modelling follows that trend, as you can see in my query below.

I am trying to determine why the first time takes so long.p  pHeres the queryp  precodeSELECT DISTINCT ID,List,From,Subject, UNIXTIMESTAMPMsgDate AS FmtDate FROM messages WHERE Listgeneral ORDER BY MsgDate LIMIT 17290,20 codepre  pMySQL version 4.0.26logp  pHeres the tablep  precodemessages  CREATE TABLE messages    ID int10 unsigned NOT NULL autoincrement,   List varchar10 NOT NULL default ,   MessageId varchar128 NOT NULL default ,   From varchar128 NOT NULL default ,   Subject varchar128 NOT NULL default ,   MsgDate datetime NOT NULL default 00000000 000000,   TextBody longtext NOT NULL,   HtmlBody longtext NOT NULL,   Headers text NOT NULL,   UserID int10 unsigned default NULL,   PRIMARY KEY  ID,   UNIQUE KEY List List,MsgDate,MessageId,   KEY From From,   KEY UserID UserID,List,MsgDate,   KEY MsgDate MsgDate,   KEY ListOnly List  TYPEMyISAM ROWFORMATDYNAMIC codepre  pHeres the explainp  precodetable   type    possiblekeys  key       keylen  ref       rows  Extra                m       ref     List,ListOnly  ListOnly  10       const    18002  Using where Using temporary Using filesort codepre  pWhy is it using a filesort when I have indexes on all the relevant columns  I added the ListOnly index just to see if it would help. I had originally thought that the List index would handle both the list selection and the sorting on MsgDate, but it didnt. Now that I added the ListOnly index, thats the one it uses, but it still does a filesort on MsgDate, which is what I suspect is taking so long.p  pI tried using FORCE INDEX as followsp  precodeSELECT DISTINCT ID,List,From,Subject, UNIXTIMESTAMPMsgDate AS FmtDate FROM messages FORCE INDEX List WHERE Listgeneral ORDER BY MsgDate LIMIT 17290,20 codepre  pThis does seem to force MySQL to use the index, but it doesnt speed up the query at all.p  pHeres the explain for this queryp  precodetable   type    possiblekeys  key     keylen  ref       rows  Extra                                       m       ref     List           List    10       const    18002  Using where Using temporary codepre  pstrongUPDATESstrongp  pI removed DISTINCT from the query. It didnt help performance at all.p  pI removed the UNIXTIMESTAMP call. It also didnt affect performance.p  pI made a special case in my PHP code so that if I detect the user is looking at the last page of results, I add a WHERE clause that returns only the last 7 days of results p  precodeSELECT m.ID,List,From,Subject,MsgDate FROM messages WHERE MsgDategt20091115 ORDER BY MsgDate DESC LIMIT 20 codepre  pThis is a lot faster. However, as soon as I navigate to another page of results, it must use the old SQL and takes a very long time to execute. I cant think of a practical, realistic way to do this for all pages. Also, doing this special case makes my PHP code more complex.p  pStrangely, only the first time the original query is run takes a long time. Subsequent runs of either the same query or a query showing a different page of results i.e., only the LIMIT clause changes are very fast.  The query slows down again if it has not been run for about 5 minutes.p  pstrongSOLUTIONstrongp  pThe best solution I came up with is based on Jason Orendorff and Juliets idea.p  pFirst, I determine if the current page is closer to the beginning or end of the total number of pages. If its closer to the end, I use ORDER BY MsgDate DESC, apply an appropriate limit, then reverse the order of the returned records.p  pThis makes retrieving pages close to the beginning or end of the resultset much faster first time now takes 45 seconds instead of 1530. If the user wants to navigate to a page near the middle currently around the 430th page, then the speed might drop back down. But that would be a rare case.p  pSo while there seems to be no perfect solution, this is much better than it was for most cases.p  pThank you, Jason and Juliet.p

Negative 2893 pI recently inherited an application developed with bare servlets and JSPs i.e. no frameworks. Ive been tasked with cleaning up the errorhandling workflow. Currently, each codeltformgtcode in the workflow submits to a servlet, and based on the result of the form submission, the servlet does one of two thingsp  ol liIf everything is OK, the servlet either forwards or redirects to the next page in the workflow.li liIf theres a problem, such as an invalid username or password, the servlet forwards to a page specific to the problem condition. For example, there are pages such as AccountDisabled.jsp, AccountExpired.jsp, AuthenticationFailed.jsp, SecurityQuestionIncorrect.jsp, etc.li ol  pI need to redesign this system to centralize how problem conditions are handled. So far, Ive considered two possible solutionsp  ul licodeExceptioncodes ul liCreate an exception class specific to my needs, such as codeAuthExceptioncode. Inherit from this class to be more specific when necessary e.g. codeInvalidUsernameExceptioncode, codeInvalidPasswordExceptioncode, codeAccountDisabledExceptioncode, etc.. Whenever theres a problem condition, throw an exception specific to the condition. Catch all exceptions via web.xml and route them to the appropriate pages with the codelterrorpagegtcode tag.li ulli licodeenumcodes ul liAdopt an error code approach, with an codeenumcode keeping track of the error code and description. The descriptions can be read from a resource bundle in the finished product.li ulli ul  pIm leaning more toward the codeenumcode approach, as an authentication failure isnt really an exceptional condition and I dont see any benefit in adding clutter to the server logs. Plus, Id just be replacing one maintenance headache with another. Instead of separate JSPs to maintain, Id have separate codeExceptioncode classes.p  pIm planning on implementing error handling in a servlet that Im writing specifically for this purpose. Im also going to eliminate all of the separate error pages, instead setting an codeerrorcode request attribute with the error message to display to the user and forwarding back to the referrer. Each target servlet Logon, ChangePassword, AnswerProfileQuestions, etc. would add an error code to the request and redirect to my new servlet in the event of a problem. My new servlet would look something like thisp  precodepublic enum Error      INVALIDPASSWORD5000, You have entered an invalid password.,     ACCOUNTDISABLED5002, Your account has been disabled.,     SESSIONEXPIRED5003, Your session has expired.

The AT enter command mode is received OK, but the problem comes with the extendedascii characters in the next two commands Changing the radio destination address which is what Im trying to do requires CCh 10h plus 3 hex radio address bytes, and exiting the command mode requires CCh ATO.p  pI know the radio can be configured OK because Ive done it on an earlier prototype with the serial commands from PIC basic, and it also can be configured by entering the commands directly from hyperterm. Both these methods somehow convert that pesky CCh into a form the radio understands.p  pIve have tried just about everything an Android noob could possibly come up with to finagle the encoding such asp  precodeprivate void commandaddress      byte[] addrArray  byte 0xCC, 16, 36, 65, 21, 13                        CharSequence addrvalues  EncodingUtils.getStringaddrArray, UTF8       sendMessageString addrvalues  codepre  pbut no matter what, I cant seem to get that highorder byte CCh20452 to behave as it should. All other lt 127 bytes, command or data, transmit with no problem. Any help here would be greatly appreciated.p  pDave p

Negative 2893 pCan we customize Lucene which is embedded in Solr just as we can in raw Lucene   So that we can have everything that we have in Lucene in Solr p  pI am asking this because we are stuck at a point of deciding Solr vs Lucene, thinking like so  p  pArgument 1  p  blockquote   pWe might hit a dead zone in future if   we choose Solr, and Lucene is a better   choice hence...

I was thinking of iterating through the Strings and removing any instance where there is a backslash, but I was wondering if there was a more efficient way of doing this or a way to have it so that the above string would not automatically be escaped as followsp  precode[[documentary, httpwww.google.comqdocumentary]] codepre  pThank you Let me know if anything is unclear.p

Negative 2893 pI have two or more threadscreated by subclassing threading.Thread running in parallel and they often communicate with each other. They communicate by calling each others methods.

Negative 2893 pSo, hello everybody.p  pIve made two test programs for creating a own control. One in Silverlight, one in WPF. I created a kind of RangeSlider. This Slider has of course two Orientations, Horizontal and Vertical.  First I used two different techniques to create my RangeSlider. In WPF I used Triggers, in Silverlight u know there arent Triggers I changed the Visibility of the Horizontal and Vertical Template in CodeBehind.This runs.p  pNow Im trying to use one technique for both, Silverlight and WPF. Therefore I use VisualStateManager.p  pIve a Template defining two Sliders one for left value, the other for right value. Simplified on the important values it looks like thatp  precode... ltControlTemplategt   ltGrid xNamePARTContentgt     lt VSM See following code sequence gt     ltGrid xNamePARTHorizontalTemplategt       ltSlider xNamePARTHorizontalSliderLeft               TemplateStaticResource HorizontalSliderTemplate               OrientationTemplateBinding Orientation gt       ...     ltGridgt     ltGrid xNamePARTVerticalTemplategt       ...     ltGridgt   ltGridgt ltControlTemplategt codepre  pAdditionally there is the VSM to switch between Horizontal and Vertical lookp  precodeltVisualStateManager.VisualStateGroupsgt   ltVisualStateGroupgt     ltVisualState xNameVerticalgt       ltStoryboardgt         ltObjectAnimationUsingKeyFrames Storyboard.TargetNamePARTHorizontalTemplate                                        Storyboard.TargetPropertyVisibilitygt           ltDiscreteObjectKeyFrame ValuexStatic Visibility.Collapsed KeyTime0gt         ltObjectAnimationUsingKeyFramesgt       ltStoryboardgt     ltVisualStategt     ltVisualState xNameHorizontal gt   ltVisualStateGroupgt ltVisualStateManager.VisualStateGroupsgt codepre  pThis still runs.p  pAs you see in the code sequence, the visual of Slider is defined by a Template, here HorizontalSliderTemplate I reduce code againp  precodeltControlTemplate xKeyHorizontalSliderTemplate TargetTypexType Slidergt   ltBorder xNameBorder ...gt     lt VSM here.

But I want to combine both ControlTemplate in one Template and use VSM. Here we come to my problemp  pI do not get running the VSM in the inner ControlTemplate. Its nearly the same code as the running VSMPart, just the TargetName is changed. I do not know how to debug whats running on GoToState, but I believe the VSM in the template is never found and from there never execute.p  pI can imagine that theres just a little detail missing, but I cant see the wood for the trees. Maybe there is an important thing what I do not know about Templates or about VSM, and Im off the track. Or do I have to trigger the inner VSM from outside, or theres a possibility to access onto Elements from outside VSM Or is there no access on VSM in inner Templatesp  pI hope I could explain my problem good enough and there is someone, who knows a solution or maybe a keyword what I can look for. Just entering keywords VSM, ControlTemplate, Storyboard, etc. in google gives no helping hand.p  pThanks in advance.p

Negative 2893 pI have a bug which makes my website freeze in PHP. It occurs on an input page, where the user fills some form, then the data is updated on the database, and then the user gets codeheadercode redirected to another page.p  pWhat happens is that the whole website branch subfolder, e.g. codewww.example.commysitecode, but not codewww.example.comanothersitecode freezes, but no other Chrome accessed web location. After a while, I can navigate on that site again, I presume after the Chrome operation timed out.p  pHowever, this only seems to happen on Chrome, and on my Mac. I tested another Safari on that Mac, Chrome on a Windows, and both worked well. I must admit this testing wasnt extensive, but I only have 1 Mac to test with. This little vennlike testing crossed browser and machine, which I think are the key factors.p  pHere is the code of the bugging page. If I comment out the header redirection, I get no dreezing. If I comment out the page update code, I get no freezing. I dont see what causes the freeze here, really. Machine OS Header redirection POST operation trycatch handling Combination I have no idea.p  pstrongEDITstrong I now see a correlation between the amount of data passed through POST from the form to the page. If the data is relatively small, everything works correctly. However, when I get bigger data i.e. HTML markup through a WYSIWYG editor field, the freeze occurs.

Negative 2893 pIve implemented server independent eTags on my site and Im now looking at adding expires headers to prevent most of the 304 requests.p  pIm concerned about using long expiration headers since it makes it tough to force a refresh if you need to update content.  And Im also not a big fan of cluttering my code with versioning query strings likep  precodeltlink relstylesheet typetextcss hrefstyle.cssversionX gt codepre  pSo Im thinking about setting the expiration header to something short like 10 minutes for almost everything.  This way, I only have a possible 10 minute window of stale content, yet for a normal browsing session, Im going to stop most of the 304s.  And even if they do stay longer, Ill just be serving one 304 every 10 minutes unless the content changes.p  pIt seems pretty elegant, yet Ive seen a lot of sites using the above versioning querystring method, and even googles modpagespeed has an option to more or less do versioning automatically, so Im just curious if this is a solid appropach or if Ive missing something that makes it impractical.p  pThanksp

Negative 2893 pI have a following scenariop  pA method that gets the list of people from a certain class that are shorter than some height threshold. I am using Where extension method to filter them out. Since the predicate depends on some external data, codeclassIdcode and codeheightcode variables become a part of the lambda closure.p  precodepublic ListltPersongt getPeopleFromClassShorterThanLimitint classId, int height      Database db  new Database     return db.Persons.Wherep gt p.Height lt height ampamp p.ClassId  classId.ToList  codepre  pThe problem is that sometimes the predicate gets complicated so I want to extract it to another methodp  precodepublic ListltPersongt getPeopleFromClassLowerThanLimitint classId, int height      Database db  new Database     return db.Persons.WhereisLowerThan.ToList   private bool isLowerThanPerson person    codepre  pHowever, the closure here becomes the problem, because I cant pass the variables to the predicate function. I can make a delegate function inline not using lambdas so that the predicate looks like a function, but then this function must also be in the same method as the codeWherecode call. In most of the scenarios its ok, strongbut sometimes I want an external function unknown at compile time to be called as the codeWherecode predicatestrong.p  pThe closest I came to the solution is thisp  precodepublic delegate bool ExtendedPredicateltT, TArggtT argument, TArg[] arguments  public static class Extended      public static IEnumerableltTgt WhereltT, TArggtthis IEnumerableltTgt collection, ExtendedPredicateltT, TArggt predicate, params TArg[] arguments              foreach T item in collection                      if predicateitem, arguments                 yield return item                   yield break        public ListltPersongt getPeopleFromClassShorterThanLimitint classId, int height      Database db  new Database     return db.Persons.WhereisFromClassShorterThanLimit, classId, height.ToList   public bool isFromClassShorterThanLimitPerson person, int[] arguments      return person.Height lt arguments[0] ampamp person.ClassId  arguments[1]  codepre  pbut I find it somewhat too narrow and also, for each extension method a new overload would have to be written. In addition to all that, I guess the EntityFramework would not be able to convert such expressions into a reasonable SQL statement not sure about this, I am no expert in how EF generates SQL from lambdas, but thats a wild guess.  emvariable number of arguments may or may not be providedemp  pstrongQuestionstrongp  pWhat Id like know to is whether there is any smart way of achieving this with regular delegates not forcing compiletime defined functions to be used as a predicate without such hacks as one shown abovep

Negative 2893 pLets say youre implementing your own version of stackoverflow once again, yesp  pYou have a service that provides all the required functionality like thisp  precodeclass Question  ...

The only thing that I dont like here is that client code ASP.NET MVC controllers has direct access to codeQuestioncodes and codeAnswercodes. Pretend we have some tough BL related with posting questions and answers. Its good idea to have this logic concentrated in a single place  on a service layer. In case your client code has access to codeQuestioncodes, its possible that someday somebody will decide to add just a little bit of logic to one of your controllers which is basically bad idea.p  pIm thinking about defining a number of DTOs which will be the part of service interface, so the client code will only be able to work with these DTOs that contain just the right amount of details.p  pLets say your question entity is defined like thisp  precodeinterface Question      int Id  get set      User Poster  get set      DateTime Posted  get set      DateTime Edited  get set      string Title  get set      string Text  get set      IQueryableltAnswergt Answers  get set      ...  codepre  pWhen posting the question, the request should only contain codeTitlecode, codeTextcode and codePostercode. So, Ill define a codePostQuestionDTOcodep  precodeclass PostQuestionDTO      User Poster  get set      string Title  get set      string Text  get set   codepre  pWhen somebody opens the page to check the question, theres a little bit more details like codePostedcode and codeEditedcodep  precodeclass QuestionDetailsDTO      User Poster  get set      string Title  get set      string Text  get set      DateTime Posted  get set      DateTime Edited  get set   codepre  pAnd so on. Is it a good practice or do you think its overengineering What are the common approaches herep
Negative 2893 pthis is a strange problem I am encountering. I have wrote a php script which enables the user to login to with valid user id and after logging in he is authorized to run a .exe file  on the web server with the click of a html link on the web page. p  pInitially I have created and tested the script on my local machine localhost and everything works fine. I have tested using both exec and system functions, both gave the same results.p  pBut the problem is these functions are not working on the web server which is Windows Server 2008. I have tried with both the functions exec and system. I have got no clue where the problem lies. I have configured and taken care in changing the path for the files when I moved my script to the server. Exactly the same files and same script, only with the change in the path for the files.p  pAny idea why this is not working on my main web server Any helpful responses would be highly appreciated.p  pThanksp

Negative 2893 pA global ld object is used throughout my program. Its contents can be entered manually, picked up from a server, or read from local storage. The writeload function uses the ld object, and when the object is picked up from local storage, all is well. I had hoped that the JSON call would use the global storage ld, but it apparently doesnt. Thus my question is how to I get the JSON ld object to the global ld object.

Negative 2893 pI have several QComboBoxes in my PyQt4Python3 GUI and they are filled with some entries from a database during the initialisation. Initial CurrentIndex is set to 0. There is also a tick box which changes the language of the items in my combo boxes. To preserve current user selection I backup index of the current item and setCurrentIndex to this number after I fill in ComboBox with translated items. All those actions emit currentIndexChanged signal.p  pBased on the items selected in QComboBoxes some plot is displayed. The idea is to redraw the plot online  as soon as the user changes any of ComboBox current item. And here I have a problem since if I redraw the plot every time signal currentIndexChanged is emited, I redraw it also several times during initialization and if the translation tick box selection was changed.p  pWhat is the best way to separate these cases In principle I need to separate programmical current Index Change from the user, and update the plot only in the later case during GUI initialisation I can programically call update plot function once. Should I writerewrite any signal If so, I never did that before and would welcome any hint or a good example.  Use another signal Or maybe there is a way to temporary block all signalsp

Negative 2893 pComing from a Java background, Im quite fond of static type safety and wonder how clojure programmers deal with the problem of data format definitions perhaps not just types but general invariants, because types are just a special case of that.p  pThis is similar to an existing question Type Safety in Clojure, but that one focuses more on the aspect of how to check types at compile time, while Im more interested in how the problem is pragmatically addressed.p  pAs a practical example Im considering an editor application which handles a particular document format. Each document consists of elements that come in several different varieties graphics elements, font elements etc. There would be editors for the different element types, and also of course functions to transform a document fromto a byte stream in its native ondisk format.p  pThe basic problem I am interested in is that the editors and the readwrite functions have to agree on a common data format. In Java, I would model the documents data as an object graph, e.g. with one class representing a document and one class for each element variety. This way, I get a compiletime guarantee about what the structure of my data looks like, and that the field width of a graphics element is an integer and not a float. It does not guarantee that width is positive  but using a gettersetter interface would allow the corresponding class to add invariant guarantees like that.p  pBeing able to rely on this makes the code dealing with this data simpler, and format violations can be caught at compiletime or early at runtime where some code attempts to modify data that would violate invariants.p  pHow can you achieve a similar data format reliability in Clojure As far as I know, there is no way to perform compiletime checking and hiding domain data behind a function interface seems to be discouraged as nonidiomatic or maybe I misunderstand, so what do Clojure developers do to feel safe about the format of data handed into their functions How do you get your code to error out as quickly as possible, and not after the user edited for 20 more minutes and tries to save to disk, when the save function notices that there is a graphics element in the list of fonts due to an editor bugp  pPlease note that Im interested in Clojure and learning, but didnt write any actual software with it yet, so its possible that Im just confused and the answer is very simple  if so, sorry for wasting your time .p

Negative 2893 pLooking for a little advice or maybe even a direct answer.p  pI have an MVC3 website. I also have a set of WCF services running for now everything is on the same box.p  pWhat Im emtryingem to do is authenticate the client that part is working fine, then pass that authenticated user on to various WCF calls.p  pAt the moment Ive hooked up the codeApplicationAuthenticateRequestcode method in codeGlobal.Asaxcode, which boils down to creating a new codeGenericIdentity amp GenericPrincipalcode, then assigning that principal to codeHttpContext.Current.Usercodep  precode... GenericIdentity identity  new GenericIdentityuserName GenericPrincipal principal  new GenericPrincipalidentity, null HttpContext.Current.User  principal ... codepre  pAnd that part seems to be working fine as well.p  pBut when I hit my service, I have completely lost the user that I set. The values are empty or false.p  pThe one main thing Ive noticed is that on the Client side, the codeHttpContext.Current.User.Identitycode object is of type codeSystem.Web.Security.FormsIdentitycode, but in the service its of type codeSystem.Security.Principal.WindowsIdentitycode.p  pBased on some of what Ive read, it sounds like simply modifying my codeweb.configcode so it contains codeaspNetCompatibilityEnabledtruecode may be enough to make this work properly. But thats not what Im seeing. So either Im not understanding everything a very good possibility or Ive got something screwed up another good possibility.p  pSo my question. Is this even possible, and if so  thoughts on what Im missing I notice a few others have posted something similar but have never quite received a definite answer see a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions1087271passingformsauthenticationcookietoawcfserviceherea and a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions5539714passingacookietoawcfserviceherea.p  pAny suggestions are very much appreciated.p

Negative 2893 pI am having quite some trouble with restoreCompletedTransactions while developing an iPhone application.  All the issues listed below occur when working in the sandbox environment.  The app is not yet selling.  Its being developed with Xcode 4.3.2 running in simulator 5.0 and 5.1. The problems I get arep  ol liEvery time the application starts and the call to addTransactionObserver is placed, updatedTransactions is called with a transaction being purchased.  On each callback my code calls finishTransaction to complete the purchase, and yet this issue keeps happening every time I start the application.  A confirmation for exactly the same purchase comes in. li liInvoking [[SKPaymentQueue defaultQueue] restoreCompletedTransactions] will not list all the nonconsumable items purchased with the account.  I have 2 purchases of nonconsumable items and only 1 is returned every time.  If I try to purchase the item missing in the list, I will get a message indicating that the item has already been purchased.  The missing item in the list is NOT the one for which I get problem 1 listed above.li ol  pAt this point I am completely stuck.  My application relies on the AppStore for returning information on nonconsumables, since we are not saving this data in our own servers.

Negative 2893 pSo one of our projects has hit a snag with some assembly code that needs to be written. We have an old, old compiled with Borland 1992 memory tester C program that occasionally needs to drop to assembly to read values from certain areas of memory. I need to write a MASM assembly routine that takes in a 32 bit memory address and return the dword at that location. My only assembly experience was about 4 years ago in MIPS, so Im pretty rusty. So far, I have thisp  precode Do a direct read of a memory address public mmapio mmapio PROC FAR  push  bp           C entry      mov   bp,sp        set pointer to parm list push  es xor   ax, ax       clear ax         mov   es, ax       clear es add   bp, 6        bump to parms  xor eax,eax        clear eax mov eax, [bp]      move the value pointed to by bp into eax mov esi, eax       source index mov eax,es[esi]                             pop   es     pop   bp           C exit     ret  mmapio ENDP codepre  pThe problem is when I read in values, I get something that is almost, but not quite, what Im looking for. When I run something like...p  precodeDWORD output  mmapio0xEFF87110 printfoutput pn  output  mmapio0xE0000000 printfoutput pn codepre  pOn a memory space where 0xEFF87110 has the value 0x00000000 in it, and 0xE0000000 has 0x80863C00 in it, I end up gettingp  precodeoutput 01100000 output 94638086 codepre  pI believe that Im mixing up my 16 bit and 32 bit registers, but any attempts to fix these have resulted in further problems. Does anyone have some better, cleaner code for reading directly from a 32 bit memory address, or can help me fix my problemp  pThanks for any help you can provide, Zachp

Negative 2893 pI have an interesting issue.  I am using FancyBox lightbox to display a video tag when the user click on the image thumbnail, and it works great for all forms of HTML5 video.

Negative 2893 pAs an example, see the following a hrefhttpwww.androidhive.info201108androidtablayouttutorial relnofollowtutoriala on how my tabs are setup initially.p  pInstead of a normal activity running on one of the tabs, I want another TabActivity.

Negative 2893 pOK, p  pI found a flash based video play that will go through a play a series of videos that it read from a XML file. This work for my needs, but it had 1 issue. All it had was a signal custom playstop button and I need a full control.p  pSo I made a component with the standard PlayPauseButton, StopButton, SeekBar, VolumeBar, and MuteButton FLV components.p  pSo I then go it so the code positioned them where I wanted them. The problem is where i want them is also at the bottom 25px of the video. So I created tween in and out when you mouse over the video framer.p  pThe problem is when the video plays and you mouse over the frame the components components fadein like they should, but they just flicker constantly. p  pSo i tired a FLVPlayback skin and it work just fine. So Im wondering if there is any way that i can fix the custom buttons Thanks in advance. p

Negative 2893 pI have a QThread which does a lot of calculations it can run for minutes, and at one and only one point it requires user input, for example in the form of a yesno dialog. Of course, no GUI elements can be accessed and no dialogs opened from the thread a Qt design choice, as it is not the main thread.p  pWell there are many obvious solutions, but Im interested in a recommended solution, or a best practice.p  pMy ideasp  ol lias there is only one point where input must be read from the GUI, I can have two threads, the second thread being started after the dialog is evaluated. Problem it makes the code inflexible, what if I have to introduce more dialogs later Unlikely, but might happen.li liI have only one thread, and I communicate with signals and slots in both directions I only have experience with signals in the form of thread to main, not in the reverse direction. So the thread runs, comes to the point where the user decision must be made, so the thread emits a signal to the main aka the GUI thread, the main catches it in a slot, creates the dialog, evaluates the result, and emits a signal to the thread. What now The thread catches the signal in a slot, but how should it affect the coderuncode method where the calculations are being done If the coderuncode exits, the thread dies. So I have something like this in my coderuncode function codewhile cancontinue  sleep code and I set codecancontinuecode in the slot where I caught the signal sent form the main. However, I have some doubts about this being the most simple  most elegant solution. strongIs there a general practice I should know aboutstrongli ol

Negative 2893 pI am making an multiplayer game in Java, and i am using a tcp connection for clientserver communication. I tried to optimize the transmission by making it send packets only when there are changes in the game, googling the issue, flushing the objectstream and socket after each transmittion, and i set the setTcpNoDelay to true. But i still can see lag, and sometimes the incoming packets stall for a few secondssometimes foreveror a very long period that i didnt try to wait, until another packet is sentsounds like buffering to me. I didnt test it over lan, just on my localhost. I know that Minecraft is written in Java, and it works very well with minimal lag, so there must be a way to fix this...p  pAre there any other tips that i can implement to speed up the tcp clientserver communicationp  pEdit The player instance includes the player speed, so between two incoming packets the game runs the other players from last known position with the last known speed.p

Negative 2893 pWell this seems silly that it cant be done  you can set a predefined attributed string to be displayed on a text view with formatting, but you cant set general formatting to be applied to live typing on a codeUITextViewcode. p  pFor example, if I do this before typing anything into the text viewp  precodeNSString string  Hello world NSMutableParagraphStyle paragraphStyle  [[NSMutableParagraphStyle alloc] init] paragraphStyle.minimumLineHeight  50.f NSMutableAttributedString aStr  [[NSMutableAttributedString alloc] initWithStringstring] [aStr addAttributeNSParagraphStyleAttributeName valueparagraphStyle rangeNSMakeRange0,[string length]] mainTextView.attributedText  aStr codepre  pThen formatting displays, and when I edit the text with the keyboard, formatting remains. p  pHowever, what if I want to start with a blank codeUITextViewcode and apply formatting to anything the user will type into the viewp  pI tried setting codestring  code or codestring   code, but neither of those retain formatting. Is there really no way to apply formatting to user input Whats the point then of a UITextView having an attributed string propertyp  pAccording to the docs, setting the codetextcode property of the codeUITextViewcode completely wipes off any formatting done by the attributed string. So whatever the solution is, it would have to not directly set codetextView.textcode property, but rather only tweak with the codeattributedTextcode property.p

Negative 2893 pI am working on a CMS using ASP.NET  C. It works fine and life is good. However, it was decided to add extra functionality to support a wider variety of websites. Basically, the current CMS is still alpha but will be able to host data for multiple websites running for the same group of companies all having somewhat the same requirements.p  pI have constructed the database as per the diagram attached belowp  pImage removed for security reasonsp  pNow, in addition to this diagram, I was asked to add support for products under different attributes than Sectors. Meaning that a product now can have a codetypecode and many other attributes. So lets say youre using one of our sites and we make tissue paper. Products should somehow support filtering by type say tissue and by application say how you use it and other unknown attributes that may pop up in the future.p  pFor example a product may fall under the Agricultural Packaging sector and is of type Bag and is applied by some way of applying it. The end result is to be able to sort products by how they are used and or their type and or the sector they fall under. Or even all together.p  pWhat is the best approach for this sort of problem to include into the data model and the CMSp  pThanksp
Negative 2893 pIm using PEAR MailQueue for sending out newsletters. I have struggled so much with PEAR Mail, but Im finally at a point where everything seems to work perfect. Im keeping the queue and using the callback functionality to update my log.p  pNow I have a new problem. I want to be able to send out an email again, but to another email address. For instance, if a user writes me to tell me that he didnt receive an email because it was sent to a wrong email address. I want to be able to send the same email to another email address without having to generate it again.p  pFortunately I can use the pear mail queue. I have the queue id, so I am able to use the codesendMailByIdcode method on the MailQueue object, but it doesnt allow me to change the recipient email address.p  pIm thinking now that the only way out is to change the recipient field in the pear queue and use codesendMailByIdcode and then change it back after the email is sent. Do you have any other suggestionsp

Negative 2893 pI have been using the March 2.2 Snapshot of Restlet GA for a while and using Jackson to handle JSON conversion.  Everything has been working fine and essentially invisibly.  In particular, I never even need to instantiate an objectMapper.  I have also been using Joda DateTime and that has been fine as well.p  pThis week, I was upgrading to the latest 2.2 Snapshot, which uses Jackson 2.0.4 rather than 1.9.  In that version of Jackson, support for Joda DateTime has been moved to a module out of the core Jackson libraries.p  pNow, when I run my test code, I get an error along the lines ofp  precodeWARNING Unable to convert a [applicationjson,UTF8] representation into an object of class com.fourspires.api.dto.CommitmentDTO com.fasterxml.jackson.databind.exc.UnrecognizedPropertyException Unrecognized field year class org.joda.time.DateTime, not marked as ignorable 2 known properties , chronology, millis]  at [Source org.restlet.engine.io.UnclosableInputStreamdcc5312 line 1, column 701] through reference chain com.fourspires.api.dto.CommitmentDTO[completeBy]gtorg.joda.time.DateTime[year] codepre  pWhich leads to a 415 error when I try to do a Post.p  pThe answer from the Jackson folks is that I must register the JodaModule that handles the conversion as follows    p  precodeObjectMapper objectMapper  new ObjectMapper objectMapper.registerModulenew JodaModule   codepre  pThis seems simple enough, but I have no idea where to put this code.  My test code is callingp  precodecommitmentsResource     rootClient.getChildSOMEPATH, CommitmentsResource.class   commitmentsClient  ClientProxy commitmentsResource.getClientResource commitmentsClient.post codepre  pOn the server side, I have an interfacep  precodepublic interface CommitmentsResource    Get Representation represent   Postjson Representation postJsonCommitmentDTO commitment     Postform Representation postFormForm commitmentForm    codepre  pAnd then I have the CommitmentServerResource that hasp  precodeOverride public final Representation postJsonfinal CommitmentDTO commitmentDTO ...

Its like I want to set the globaldefault object mapper, but I dont know where to find it or if it exists.  p  pI tried adding the two objectMapper lines of code to my createInboundRoot, but that didnt seem to make a difference.p  pThanks so much for any advice as I seem to be totally stuck here....p

Negative 2893 pI have an outlook addin developed with VSTO 2010 that I want to write some event logging. While debugging I can get this to work by simply doing the followingp  precodeif EventLog.SourceExistsADDINFRIENDLYNAME      EventLog.CreateEventSourceADDINFRIENDLYNAME, null  EventLog.WriteEntryADDINFRIENDLYNAME, message, EventLogEntryType.Warning codepre  pThe problem is the release version the addin doesnt have admin rights to read the log. I found some articles that talked about creating the EventLog source during installation,  but Im using ClickOnce and it doesnt seem there is a way to do that. Also, someone talked about creating a separate DLL and then call codeInstallUtilcode on that DLL to create the source. This doesnt work for me either since this still requires admin rights. p  pIs it possible to have the addin run using Outlooks security level I see Outlooks messages in the event log so it must have enough rights to do so.p

Negative 2893 pI know this is a somewhat common question but Im a newbie and I always appreciate a second or 100th pair of eyes on a problem Im been noodling.p  pIm wondering if Im taking the right approach here  Im trying to model a product with several variations and the associated gift certificates sold against that product.p  pA product, for example, for a restaurant might be a tasting menu for 2 whereas variations might be food only, with partial wine pairing, and with full wine pairing, etc.  just an illustrative example.p  pHeres a distilled version of what Ive come up withp  precodeclass Product   include MongoidDocument    field name, type String    hasmany giftcertificates   embedsmany variations end  class Variation   include MongoidDocument    field name, type String    embeddedin product   hasmany giftcertificates       end  class GiftCertificate   include MongoidDocument    field recipient, type String   field amount, type Float    belongsto product   belongsto variation end codepre  pSo when we create a GiftCertificate, its defined as belonging to both a product and a variation is that correct.  An example might be a 200 gift certificate for tasting menu for 2 [product] with partial wine pairing [variation], etc.p  pI feel like the embedsmany  embeddedin relation here for ProductsVariations is ideal as it fits the profile for when it should be used  Ill never be accessing a product without its variation, and I never need to access a variation independant of a product  they go handinhand.p  pSo the question is whether Im doing this the right way.p  pIve managed to massage the basic CRUD forms into working using ryanbs excellent a hrefhttpsgithub.comryanbnestedform relnofollownestedforma gem, with a bit of tweaking.  Editing the Products amp Variations are easy the basic use case, but the trouble Im having comes when working with the Gift Certificates.p  pMongoid is giving me a bit of trouble ... the GiftCertificate belonging to both a product and its variation seems kludgy, and I have to manually set the GiftCertificate.variation each time I do a find, i.e.p  precodegc  GiftCertificate.findparams[id]  as normal gc.variation  gt nil, doesnt work by itself gc.variation  gc.product.variations.findgc.variationid  Have to manually set this gc.variation  Now this works as its supposed to codepre  pAnyway, before I go on  would love to get some thoughts on the above.  p  pThanks in advance  p

Negative 2893 pMy technology stack is Tomcat servlet 3.0, Jersey for JAXRS, Spring and Hibernate. When something unexpect goes wrong like some data conversion error in Hibernate, I do not want the clients to see my stacktrace for those exceptions that the Tomcat tries to print by default. However I would like to log those exceptions so I can find what is wrong and fix things.p  pMy first try was using ExceptionMapper from JAXRS and naively thinking that would solve my problems. But then I noticed that Jersey throws its own exceptions for example urls that are not mapped are com.sun.jersey.api.NotFoundExceptions. This causes 404 exceptions to be logged which I dont want.

Negative 2893 pI have a view built with Interface Builder which has a grid of buttons like sobr X Xbr X Xp  pThe bottom pair are the ones causing issues. Nothing happens programatically to the buttons at all they arent even connected to the code, they just call selectors. Ive set the Button Image of both to two different images. Before setting the image for each, they both showed up fine as buttons, but as soon as I set the image, theyre acting strange.p  pSometimes very rarely they show up fine. Other times, the image is squashed to one side, filling less than half the button area. Most times they just dont appear at all. Each acts independently, so the behaviour of both buttons is never the same. Theyre set up with the custom button style not round rect buttons. What I dont get is that the top pair of buttons are set up identically in fact, theyre copied and pasted and they always show up fine. Ive compared the properties of each and theyre identical in that respect.p

Negative 2893 pIm a beginner in Node and generally all backend web development, and I have started to write a RESTful API in Node. There are a few things Im trying to get my head around.p  pMy application uses Express and Mongoose, and I am using the codeexpressresourcecode module to easily create my CRUD routes for the API resources. But there are a couple of things I am unhappy about, and think I could do better.p  pThe first is Mongoose. If I want to write tests for my API, I have no way of stubbing Mongoose to force it to in memory data. All of the tutorials out there seem to point to Mongoose, however, and Im really not sure what I should be using.p  pSecondly, my resource seems to have a lot of boilerplate code. Is this really the best way to create a RESTful API in Node.js Are there other modules that will help me to create my CRUD routes I believe there are ways you can create CRUD routes right from your schema, without anymore code, but Im really not sure how.p  pI have seen projects out there such as Tower.js and CompoundJS formally RailwayJS that seem to be these comprehensive solutions that solve much more than my issues here. Perhaps I should be using them, but I really only want the Node.js application to be an API and nothing more. I am dealing with the frontend independently of the API.p  pTo provide some context, here is my current situation. Currently, I have a model defined in Mongoosep  precodevar mongoose  requiremongoose   , Schema  mongoose.Schema   , Link  var LinkSchema  new Schema   uri String,   meta      title String,     desc String   ,   shares [     uid Schema.Types.ObjectId,     date Date,     message String   ]   Link  module.exports  mongoose.modelLink codepre  pNext, I define the controllers for the CRUD routesp  precodevar mongoose  requiremongoose   ,   requireunderscore   , Link  mongoose.modelLink  exports.load  function req, id, fn    Link.findByIdreq.params.link, function err, link      if err        return res.senderr           fnnull, link      exports.index  function req, res    var filterByUser  req.query.user   shares.uid req.query.user       Link.findfilterByUser, function err, links      if err        return res.senderr           res.sendlinks      exports.create  function req, res    var link  new Linkreq.body    link.savefunction err      if err         TODO send 404       return res.senderr           res.sendlink      exports.show  function req, res    res.sendreq.link   exports.update  function req, res    req.link  req.link.extendreq.body    req.link.savefunction err, link      if err        return res.senderr           res.sendlink      exports.patch  exports.update  exports.destroy  function req, res    req.link.removefunction err      if err        return res.senderr           res.send     codepre  pFinally, I use the codeexpressresourcecode module to map these controllers to the necessary CRUD routes on top of the Express app.p  precodeapp.resourceapilinks, require..resourceslinks codepre
Negative 2893 pI have tried multiple ways to get the production SharePoint content to my newly installed local development environment that is running on a VM Windows Server 2008 R2.  After an export of the farm and a restore failed I came across this blog post and followed these instrucitons a hrefhttprichardstk.wordpress.com20120203buildasharepoint2010developmenttestenvironment relnofollowhttprichardstk.wordpress.com20120203buildasharepoint2010developmenttestenvironmenta.  To sum up, its basically backing up the live SQL Content database as well as the Profile, Sync and Social databases, then restoring them on the dev machine and pointing SharePoint to use these new databases instead of the old ones.  Then after that I deployed the custom webparts to the development server from within Visual Studio.p  pIve done this and it seemed to work pretty well.  I can access Central Administrator as well as setting up a SharePoint Connection within Visual Studio and being able to see all the pages, lists, documents, etc.  So it is definitely pointing to the new content database.  I should mention I can also connect via SharePoint Designer and access all the correct content, Master Pages, lists, etc.p  pThe problem I am having is that I am getting a Could not load file or assembly error when I go to the site in a browser and it takes me to PagesHome.aspx.  The file is a custom webpart that I have deployed from within Visual Studio.  When I look within the GAC I see the assembly listed but the PublicKeyToken is different from the one that is shown in the error message.p  pWhen I dig into it a little more I see that the custom user control is registered in my Master page, and when I look at the ascx file in the controltemplates directory where it is located there is an Assembly that looks like thisp  precodelt Assembly NameBlogRoll, Version1.0.0.0, Cultureneutral, PublicKeyToken529e9730fe2a198d gt codepre  pThat PublicKeyToken is correct for the live site when I look in the GAC there but when I deployed it to my local GAC it created a new PblicKeyToken.  Sorry if Im rambling but I wasnt sure what was relevant and what wasnt.p  pI guess my question is how to handle this  It doesnt seem smart to change all the ascx files locally to match the new PublicKeyTokens that I have in the local GAC because then when I deploy these changes to live they wont find the appropriate assembly.  What is the best way to handle thisp  pstrongUPDATEstrongp  pThe code in question has a key.snk file that is being used to strongly sign it.  My understanding is that this should make it so that it gets compiled with a specific PublicKeyToken each time and therefore install in the GAC with a specific PublicKeyToken.  If that is true, then I believe the only reason it would have a different key token on my dev environment versus the production is that the key.snk file that has been provided is incorrect.  Is that truep

Negative 2893 h2Original title Memory leak opening files lt 128KB in Pythonh2  h2Original questionh2  pI see what I think is a memory leak when running my Python script. Here is my scriptp  precodeimport sys import time   class MyObjobject     def initself, filename         with openfilename as f             self.att  f.read   def myfuncfilename     mylist  [MyObjfilename for x in xrange100]     lenmylist     return []   def main     filename  sys.argv[1]     myfuncfilename     time.sleep3600   if name  main     main codepre  pThe main function calls codemyfunccode which creates a list of 100 objects that each open and read a file. After returning from codemyfunccode, Id expect memory from the 100item list and from reading the file to be freed since they are no longer referenced. However, when I check the memory usage using the codepscode command, the Python process uses about 10,000 KB more memory than a Python process run from a script with lines 12 and 13 commented out.p  pThe strange thing is that the memory leak if thats what it is only seems to occur for files lt128KB in size. I created a bash script to run this script with files ranging in size from 1KB to 200KB and the memory increase stopped when the files size hit 128KB. Here is the bash scriptp  precodebinbash  echo PID RSS S TTY TIME COMMAND gt output.txt  for i in seq 1 200 do     python debugmemory.py datastuffiK.txt amp     pid     sleep 0.1     ps e O rss  grep

Negative 2893 pI have encountered something I would like explained.  I have a function InitializeValues that sets up a combobox, and sets the datasource to a datatable. The datatable is retrievedfrom an instance of the class DGVMainFunctions using the public method GetFileSourceData which takes no parameters.br   The issue is that a call to GetFileSourceDataMyConnectionString will actually compile and run. A run time error occurs when the datatable is returned and attempted to set to the datasource of the cbo. The normal call GetFileSourceData works properly.   I had asked another developer about this, and he thought I had some stale reference, so I cleaned the project, then deleted everything in my debug folder, and rebuilt, but it still had the same behavior.p  pMy question is this, Why does the compiler accept this and not throw a syntax error, and furthermore why does it even get to the point where you can actually step into this function that should not exist, and have it fail on return p  pstrongEDITstrong Putting Option Strict On, does make the compiler catch this.   Option Strict On disallows implicit conversions from String to Integer.  But that is still not the error I want to see. I would like to know why it does not display something along the lines of No such overloaddefinition of that function exists. p  pThe error is thisp  blockquote   pAn error occurred creating the form.

Negative 2893 pIve been thinking about this a bit.  The idea is that something goes wrong in PROD.  The data that was captured causes the web app to behave differently than in other environments.  So, also data in other environments gets out of sync with prod as expected.  However, a bug comes along and for some reason it only happens in PROD, probably because of the differences in data.p  pIm wondering what is a good practice to remedy these kinds of problems  More tests, for sure.  But beyond that  One could create new data in dev, but the whole point is that some data point, or some combination of actions causes a data point to be wrong.  Perhaps when using some other data source to arrive at the actual data point, which is different then the expected data point.  Apologizes that this isnt a great description, and tries to be both an example and a definition of a general production bug.p  pI know this isnt a very precise question.  Hopefully, there are references that make good suggestions.p

Negative 2893 pIm developing my own PHP MVC for a database application, which Id already completed but using monolithic classes that do everything  MySQL processing, input processing and display. It works great but its a nightmare to debug and to make alterations Ive recently discovered MVCs and in the process of rewriting the app  its all on the drawing board at the moment so I havent actually got any code to share with you.p  pTheres one thing Im stumbling on Ive got it that the Controller should call the Model to modify it based on user input, and then call the View, which will access the Models it needs to get its data and then display it. Id like the view to gets its data independently of the Controller, and not have the Controller act as the intermediary. I started off down that line of the Controller getting its data from the Model and handing it to the View, but quickly ran into trouble where a View would need access to several Models.p  pTo explain what Im stuck on, Ill draw an examplep  hr  pstrongExample submitting a form with data, which fails the Models validationstrongp  pFront controllerp  ul liLoad the relevant controller and call the ProcessForm action ul  pControllerp  ul liInstantiate the Model class and call the methods to load and validate the data ul  pModelp  ul livalidation failed generate a list of errors and return false ul  pControllerp  ul liIf Model had returned true, redirect to the Index page liIt returned false invoke the View ul  pViewp  ul liInstantiate the Model class and fetch the data liDisplay the data and the error messages ul  hr  pMy problem is, how can the View, which has its own instance of the Model, get the error messages which were generated in the Controllers instance of the model, without the Controller handing its own Model instance directly to the View Im figuring the first instance would need to store the messages somewhere where the second instance could retrieve themp  pI realise the first instance could return its errors to the Controller, which it can then pass to the view, independent of the Model itself, but Id still like to keep the View independent of the Controller.p

Negative 2893 pI am creating a wizard and I need to propagate a list that I have created.  The list is of my Contact model.  I need to put this in the form so that when I post back to the controller on my final step I can have the list of Contacts as part of the wizard model it just returns null now.  For other simple form objects I use a HiddenFor to keep the data in the model.  This doesnt work because a hidden for is just a text box and I have a complex object.p  pI considered creating a DropDownListFor and wrapping it in a hidden div.  This is just patchwork and would actually take a bit of work to get DropDownListFor to accept another object type if it would work at all.p  pI have considered saving the list to Session[Contacts], but that does not seem like the proper MVC way to go.

Negative 2893 pI am fairly new to development. Currently I have a customised tab bar using images for each tab that works perfectly and also includes a table view and navigation view that then leads to a second tab bar which I want to have different tab images. When I try to implement the same code in the second tab bar area it does not work and instead of making the second tab bar change it changes the first tab bar to my new images. How can I stop this from happening by using the same code or how do I need to change the code obviously the images change for the second tab bar.

Negative 2893 pI have been using github for quite a while. Now I have multiple branches for a project and also working on a couple of branches at the same time. For every branch I have a folder dedicated to itself and I commit and do a push to respective branches. Now I have a situation where I have to update one of my branches with changes in the master, since I branched before making the changes to the master. Before I do any commit, I created a playground repo and was playing with it. This is the method I follow to merge the changes from my master to the branch and I would like to get all of your opinions on this method  whether its correct or not and also whether something else has to be done. Of course, I figured out this method using SO, but the answers were in bits and pieces across multiple questions. But just wanted a single point where I could verify what I am doingp  pAs a side note, while I was looking up for information, I saw that I dont have to create separate folders for the branches and can just use 1 folder. But I like this approach better  maintaining separate folders. p  pHere is what I dop  precode make some changes to master and commit it  git add . git commit m at last git push u origin master   cd to the branch  git pull  git merge originmaster   now commit to branch  git add .  git commit m updates from master  git push u origin playground0.1 codepre  pCan you please let me know whether I am following the correct approach Thanks a lotp
Negative 2893 pI have created a website to host a portfolio of my programming work. Some of my projects are games in the form of Java applets. Surprisingly, it sounds like a lot of the major web hosts do not support Java applets.

For example, this Go Daddy representative clearly says that Java applets arent supported on the cheaper GoDaddy hosting options. a hrefhttpsupport.godaddy.comgroupswebhostingforumtopicjavaappletnotdeploying relnofollowhttpsupport.godaddy.comgroupswebhostingforumtopicjavaappletnotdeployingap  pI also spoke to people from JustHost and BlueHost and it sounds like they also do not support Java applets unless you have a very expensive hosting plan with them. p  pAre there any hosts suitable for hosting personal websites that allow you to upload Java applets Or am I misunderstanding and all of the hosts do support Java applets I understand why Java serverside software might not be allowed, but it seems like there is no reason Java applets wouldnt work.p

Negative 2893 pis it possible to create and mount a virtual filesystem what is made over normal files and not over diskpartitionp  pFirstly I though in LVM, and instead of use disks or partitions, use files. But it isnt possible, or I dont know how to dot it. p  pIm think in something like use Truecrypt over Dropbox with a large Truecrypt container 1Gb for example. Because synchronize 1Gb in Dropbox is very slow, I thint that if the virtual filesystem is made over small files with size of 100Kb for example, it would be equivalent as blocks with size of 100Kb of a conventional filesystem. All modifications in the virtual filesystem will correspond to some physical files which will be synchronized over Dropbox.p  pThis synchronization is light compared to the size of the virtual filesystem, and would enable the Truecryp container.p  pI would be it possible to Linux operating system, but it would be good idea to be possible to WindowsMacetc OS.p  pWhat do you think about itp  pAny other alternativep

Negative 2893 pIve got a strange problem. I am using Eclipse Indigo with ADT plugin for Android development. p  pMy problem is that the Graphical Layout Editor is somehow outdated. It doesnt look like the version presented on android developers website.

But this does not make sense to me  that was supposed to be the whole point of the async method.  It should allow the main thread handling requests to continue.

For every call the method locks until input from terminal .  At first I do not unblock it.

Ive also read a bit on using jQuerys fadeInfadeOut to stop flickering, but it doesnt seem to work for me either, or Im doing something wrong. I can see the image fading out and then fading in, but it flickers in the middle, when its actually updated by the updatepanel.p  pIm happy to post snippets of code, if needed.

I attempted to reduce the lines by using collectionsmaps prior and then nested codeFOREACHcode clauses, which works fine until the codeFOREACHcode for creating days.p  pProblem seems to be from using a mapped integer, if I replace codem.numcode with a plain integer it will process the days fine, but only for a single monthmultiple times.p  pThe query was based off of Kenny Bastanis query herebr a hrefhttpsgist.github.comkbastani8519557 relnofollowhttpsgist.github.comkbastani8519557a  p  pI also changed codeCREATEcode to codeCREATE UNIQUEcode which should prevent duplicate relationshipsnodes similar to codeMERGEcodep  pShould I be writing the query differently I did have an older version of the query work once but then lock on executing query, both on localhost and grapheneDB.

Since my first version of the query I changed the way I create the leapyear collection. Regular years with the query work fine, it was just broken with leap years. This was because of misunderstanding regularyear[2..11], I was expecting it to slice [2][11], however the 2nd integer is a cap Changing that to 12 adds all remaining months. The method also caused leapyear to have a length of 3 instead of 12, Have worked around it by changing the line to thisbr codeWITH [regularyear[0], num 2, days LeapFebruary]  filtermonth in regularyear WHERE month.numgt2 AS leapyear, regularyearcodep  pThe 2nd issue I picked up was in the third codeFOREACHcode I was using codeyear.months[m.num].dayscode Where I should have m.num1 to access the collection correctly, and again for the last codeMERGEcode. The query is still broken for leap years however..p  pemstrongUpdate 2emstrong I think my fixes listed in EDIT have done the trick. In my localhostDB all years seem to create fine except for the year I was testing 2000, I checked with a similar leap year 2400 and that worked. p  pI attempted the query on a database in grapheneDB and got the following errorbr codeThe pattern thisMonth[1469codeFIRSTcode]gtfirstDay produced multiple possible paths, and that is not allowedcode  p  pThe snippet of code it is referring to isp  precodeFOREACHm IN year.months   MERGE thisMonthMonth  month m.num, year year.year   CREATE UNIQUE thisYear[HASMONTH]gtthisMonth   MERGE firstDayDay  day 1, month m.num, year year.year   CREATE UNIQUE thisMonth[FIRST]gtfirstDay codepre  pI had been working on this query in that database in grapheneDB, creating a new database and using the query everything worked fine, even year 2000. It took about 4000ms, I then tried the query with a mix of regularleap years totalling 6 years. It was unable to complete the query, plenty of nodes existed though. Using the query again on a single year existing or not failed. My query must be breaking the database somehowp

Negative 2893 pSorry for the long title.  Its taken me an hour, but Ive finally got this working.  My question is if theres a much quicker, more efficient way to do what Im doing here.  p  pBasically, Ive got an HTML text input field that uses jQuery to populate autocomplete dropdown answers in this case, artists for a list of songs Ive favorited.  I previously had it working smoothly until I found that it was displaying duplications of some artists who I had favorited more than one song of.  So I needed to use arrayunique to get rid of the duplicates.  p  pUnfortunately my list was not in array form from the MySQL results, but just a string.  After fiddling around for a while I got it to display in an array, but now this messed up my formatting for the jQuery list.  arraywalk helped me format each item in the array, and then I converted this to a string.  It just seems like a lot of work.  Can I do it in less stepsp  pHere is my codep  precodeltinput typetext classspan3 stylemargin 0 auto  autocompleteoff nameartist dataprovidetypeahead dataitems4 datasource[lt  artistlist  SELECT  FROM songs where id gt 0 result  mysqligtqueryartistlist  while row  mysqlifetchassocresult   artists[]  .row[artist]., have to format this way for the jQuery results.  artists  arrayuniqueartists   function formatArtistsampartists  artists  strreplace, amp39, artists have to do this because of O names.   arraywalkartists, formatArtists foreachartists as artist  artistSelect . artist   artistSelect  substrtrimartistSelect, 0, 1 I have to convert the array to a string so that I can trim the final comma from the list of artists.

Negative 2893 pIm building an Android app in which I need to have a very accurate location at a very high frequency. I dove into google play services api for location, and found the LocationRequest.setSmallestDisplacement very useful to limit battery consumption.p  pHowever, as I am testing it indoor, the locations I get have an accuracy that varies a lot sometimes 10m, sometimes 96m..., even when I set the Priority of my request as high accuracy.p  pMy prob1em is that setSmallestDisplacement doesnt give a shit about the accuracy that is returned last. So if I get a location with a very low accuracy, I will still have to walk my smallest displacement distance to get a new one, hopefully more accuracte.p  pI wonder if there is a way to avoid such data I cant use location that are not accurate enough or if I have to skip the setSmallestDisplacement part bad for battery consumption.p  pSome code for your pleasurep  precodemLocationRequest  LocationRequest.create mLocationRequest.setInterval100 We get a new location every 100ms or so mLocationRequest.setSmallestDisplacement5  but only if we traveled 5m mLocationRequest.setPriorityLocationRequest.PRIORITYHIGHACCURACY codepre  pThanks.p

However, sendmail is a big pain in the butt to configure properly, and I am not versed with any of PHPs mail abilities and requirements. I am attempting to use GoDaddys SMTP servers to send emails from my domain, but the connections are failing and are coming from a generic domain with no TLD extension. This is a big issue as nearly all mail providers block generic domains, and documentation for setting up sendmail with SMTP servers is very sparse.p  pMy questions arep  ul lipShould I be using sendmail, or is there a better alternative to hook into GoDaddys SMTP serverspli lipA colleague at work told me that sendmail is actually an SMTP server itself, and is just relaying to GoDaddy, which may cause interference and authentication issues. Is this truepli ul  pIf I am completely on the wrong path, links to good resources are much appreciated. Thanks in advancep
Negative 2893 pI have done a few small projects in Symfony 2, they are really simple projects as I am a beginner they have one bundle only and this bundle manages the forms and data access to from 1 to 3 tables. Now someone is interested on one of this bundles and he wants me to develop some other functionality that is going to require some more bundle and they are supposed to use the same database, templates, etc. I have a lot of doubts, but there is one thing that I need to be able to start and is to take the entities and probably some of the forms out of the original bundle let sayp  precodesrc MyProject   MyBundle      Entity      Form codepre  pAnd I want to have this entities and general forms as and independent folder probably inside codeMyProjectcode let sayp  precodesrc MyProject   Entity General entities   Form general forms   MyBundle      Entity      Form codepre  pI do not know if this is the correct approach, but I think I need something like this. I have been reading a few docs about best practices and they do something similar not exactly the same but every developer has his own book. The question is how do you tell Symfony that the entities are not any more here and they are some where else, I have tried to change the codenamespacescode paths and the codeusecode statements, but it does not work by doing only that, Symfony is still looking for those entities inside codeMyBundlecode. Can any one assist me some how or point me out to reliable docsp

Negative 2893 pI have a website with 3 full screen background images that use a custom parallax scrolling script utilizing strongrequestAnimationFramestrong and strongtransformtranslate3dstrong for its animation. I did this because after a fair amount of research on the subject of visual performance this was the best alternative then using canvas.p  pMy problem is that my page runs very smooth on Firefox 29.1 because it is most definitely using the computers GPU to render the page and composite layers however for some reason, Chrome is has some major bottlenecks.p  pI am getting tremendous performance spikes way less then 30fps when I scroll down my page... but an interesting thing I noticed was that it happens specifically just as one of the background images that is being animated with the script set as backgroundpositioncover enters into the viewport.p  pThere is a repaint operation happening because the background image is being resized to fit the viewport widthheight and that is causing a tremendous performance hit. Considering that the gpu isnt working correctly for my Chrome, but also that I would like to make my page perform super silky smooth when scrolling even without hardware acceleration, is there a method of preloading imagesframes and having them already resized before they are scrolled onto screen Like a frame buffering technique to ensure all the calculations and resizing is finished well before a user scrolls to that image on screenp

Negative 2893 pI am finally confused with a problem related to the Android GridViews. I am sorry for a little bit long description,  but I have not a lot of time to optimize my question.p  pHere is what I want to get. There should be a GridView with 8x10 elements. Each element has an initially generated random color from 5 supported color set. I have used Android View type for an element and just set a background color.p  pEvery time when user clicks on an element it should be deleted and all the elements above it should be moved down to fill the vacant space.  I am taking the color id from the element above and set it to the current element and do so till reaching the very top element, then randomly generating new color for the top element of the column. p  pAfter all of this stuff I just call the function notifyDataSetChanged on my adapter which were used for the GridView.p  pThe problem is that the behavior is unpredictable. On some devices it works on some devices it updates all the elements and all elements are changed. Sometimes I see that there were no color set which seems was related to the optimization and seems I found a solution...p  pSo, Do anybody faced with some kind of issues How do you reached a stable expected behavior   May be you can suggest some other easier solution or some related documentationsexampleslessons I have already read almost all what Google brings about the GridLayouts.p  pI am kindly appreciate the time you have spent on my question Thanks, Arsenp  pstrongUpdatedstrongp  pHere is some part of codes which I am using sorry for not publishing some details.p  pin layout.xmlp  precode ltGridView     classltnamegt  androidididgridView1 androidlistSelectornull androidlayoutwidthwrapcontent androidlayoutheightwrapcontent androidlayoutmargin0dp androidlayoutalignParentBottomtrue androidhorizontalSpacing0dp androidnumColumns8 androidpadding0dp androidstretchModecolumnWidth androidcacheColorHintandroidcolortransparent androidverticalSpacing0dp gt  ltGridViewgt codepre  pin layout.simplegridviewelementp  precodeltView xmlnsandroidhttpschemas.android.comapkresandroid     androidididbox     androidlayoutwidthwrapcontent     androidlayoutheightwrapcontent     androidgravitycentervertical gt codepre  pin ImageAdapder which extends BaseAdapterp  precode ...

Negative 2893 pOkay, so I was simply experimenting with HTML5 canvas and seeing if I could make a simple wave animation. When I made that work, I wanted to fill the width of the screen with canvases to make it seem like an ocean.p  pI decided that I needed to know the exact number of canvases needed to fill the width of the screen, and then some  without breaking the line. Simply enoughp  precodevar swidth  window.screen.width var iwidth  100 width of each canvas var cwidth  Math.ceilswidth  iwidth The number of canvases needed var containWidth  iwidth  cwidth To keep them all in line I use a container which then overflows the page codepre  pNow I make a for loop which writes the canvases, based on cwidth. No problem.p  pBut each of the canvases need to be cleared and reanimated each time. This is where I run into my problem. Just testing on my own screen, I figured how many canvases were needed, and wrote the appropriate number of variables 14 in my case. But what about other screens When trying to add more variables than I needed, the function broke, because the excess variables were empty.p  pWhat I need is to somehow create exactly the correct number of variables, maybe in an array, and then call them within a function. I tried searching the intarwebz, but I couldnt find any examples of this.p  pThe variables I need to write arep  precodeexvar0  document.getElementByIdmyCanvas0.getContext2d codepre  pWhere the number behind myCanvas must be incremented according to cwidth.p  pThen I need to use the variables within a function likep  precodeexvar0.clearRect0,0,100,50 exvar0.drawImageimg, i, 0 codepre  pBut I need to write the variables the same number of times within the function as well.p  pI tried using variable.push to create an array with the correct number of variables, but I am unsure of how to use it. I hope someone can explain it to me, because it is driving me crazy to not be able to figure it outp  pAnd of course, the solution is probably quite simple as well. Oh well, thank you to whoever takes their time to explain it to me, and sorry for my bad explanation. 3p  h2[Edit] Solutionh2  pAs I knew, the problem wasnt really so difficult. Thanks to T.J. Crowder I managed to think about it a bit more calmly, and of course it worked on the first try.p  pFirst calculate the number of canvasesp  precodefunction waveCalc var swidth  window.screen.width var iwidth  100 var cwidth  Math.ceilswidth  iwidth Calculate number of canvases necessary to definitely fill the screen width, and then some. var containWidth  iwidth  cwidth Calculate the width needed for the inner container to force line stability. codepre  pMake a string variable with the number of canvas elements neededp  precodecanvas       for i0i lt cwidthi     canvas  ltcanvas classcanvas idmyCanvas  i   width100 height50gtltcanvasgt Add each string with a new integer, to ensure unique IDs for all canvases.      codepre  pAnd write the string variable to the container elementp  precodedocument.getElementByIdcandivcontainer.innerHTML  canvas Write out the canvases. codepre  pUse a for loop to push the correct number of variables into the cnvsVar arrayp  precodevar cnvsVar  [] var canNum  forcanNum  0 canNum lt cwidth canNum cnvsVar.pushdocument.getElementByIdmyCanvascanNum.getContext2d  codepre  pCreate an image object to hold the sprite used for the animation, and add a function onload to actually run the animationp  precodevar img  new Image img.src  testwavesprite.png img.onload  function  document.getElementByIdcandivcontainer.style.width  containWidth  px     var i  0 setIntervalfunction codepre  pHere, make two new arrays in the same way as before, one for clearing the canvas, and one for redrawing itp  precodevar y var clrRct  [] var drwImg  []  fory  0 y lt cwidth y clrRct.pushcnvsVar[y].clearRect0,0,100,50 drwImg.pushcnvsVar[y].drawImageimg, i, 0       if i gt 2300     i  100      else      i  0          ,200  codepre  pAnd voila, it works Simple as that.

By holding your finger on the word question in the first textsection Stack Overflow is a question and answer site ...etc you wont be able to select that word, because it will select the whole textblock instead.p  pNow this may be fine in this case. But I need to know the logic behind it. The problem Im having is that we havep  pSome textlines. Below that on the left site we have a small text in a seperate div en a textual code on the right side also in a seperate div. There is a container around those items because otherwise we wouldnt be able to create certain markup.p  pWhen we try to select that textual code it will instead select the whole container. But if we zoom in, we are able to select more specific items but still not what we want.p  pDoes anyone have a clue how to fix this problem Do we have to fiddle with zindexes or whateverp

Negative 2893 pThis question is for standards gurus.p  pWhat does a typical C compiler do that Java doesnt or viceversa when interpreting floating point values.p  pNow I know the basics of how floating point numbers are stored. I know that the computer cannot exactly represent those numbers that are not a power of 2. p  pHowever, it occurred to me that C somehow manages to correct for that.For example the expression 0.15  0.15 yields 0.3 when compiled in C gcc as opposed to 0.30000000000000004 in Java So my question is twofoldp  ol lipIf the number is actually represented internally as 0.30000000000000004, what does a C compiler do to correct for it Does it simply reduce the precision Does the correction happen only when the number is evaluated Is there an overhead Or is it actually stored as 0.3 somehowpli lipWhat was the rationale behind the design decision that makes Java not correct for it. This makes using floating point primitives a real pain in Java Yes I am aware of BigDecimal etc. Is it faster this way Is it more correctpli ol  pIf there is a benefit behind the Javaway of doing things I would be glad to hear it.p  pI really would like to hear both sides in this. This is for programming language design research.p

Negative 2893 pI decided to implement jenkins hash function in my project.

Max number of elements in my hash table is 140 000 so i set up len  140 000. and the input into this function is string the length of string is variable and can be made up using any character from ascii table. p  pThe problem is that when i run this hash it returns number for example like 14234567 but my table have only indexes up to 139 999. p  pAny advice what can be wrong or how to change it to work right p

Negative 2893 pI have added multithreading to a raytracer I am writing, and while it does run much faster now, when its running, my computer is almost unusably slow. Obviously I want to use all my PCs compute power, but I dont want it to prevent any other application from getting access to the CPUs. p  pI thought about having the threads sleep, but unless they all sleep at the same time, then the other threads would just eat up the extra time. Also, I dont necessarily want to give up a certain percentage of available compute power if Im not going to use it. p  pAlso, This is not my official question Ive noticed that for some reason the first thread launched does more work than the second, and the second more than the third, and so on until like the last 5 threads out of 32 wont actually get a crack at any work, despite the fact that theres plenty to go a around theres at least 0.5M work items for them to chew through.

I understand here is every time this Service method is called, a codeTransactioncode will start and when it reaches to DAO class it will use the same Transaction but for every codeEntityManagercode operation it look for Active PersistenceContext and create it as required. Is this approach correct and thread safebr So, if a new thread starts the same service method then a new Transaction and a persistence Context will be created and flushed away when the method endsbrbr 2.

Negative 2893 pSo Im working on a dictionary with 1 000 000 keys, and my assignment is to have it working at under 3 seconds on Intel 2.4 GHz. I tried profiling my code and the while loop has a lot of hits, but I cant figure out a way to make my code run faster without it. Is there a way to improve my code in order for it to work faster p  pThe code should and it does that, but too slowly make a dictionary, where the keys are all integers from 2 to 999999, and the values are the lengths of lists which are made from a sequence pattern.

Negative 2893 pso Im writing an android app with a special inapp currency. You can buy this currency in packets of 1, 5, 10 etc through inapp billing. Here is how I implemented itp  ol lipUse managed products When the app starts, I use IabHelper to query for purchased productspli lipAs soon as the purchase completes, consume the purchasepli liWhen consumption finishes, send purchase token to the serverli liServer checks through play API, and then provisions the account with the currencyli ol  pMy question is, what if step 3 fails If the connection gets cut off or something, the purchase token will never get to my server. In that case, users will have paid for currency but their account wont get it. When my app starts again, and 1a runs, it wont find the purchase and it wont reconsume it either.p  pIs this reasoning correct If so, do I need to store purchase tokens on the android side Then, if something fails, I keep retrying until it works It seems kind of messy... I was also thinking of making a  My purchases page where you could see all your purchases, and then click them to redeem it if step 3 failed for some reason.p
Negative 2893 pIm new to javascript so forgive my stupidity.

When the question icon fades in that becomes a prompt to click one of the  note  buttons underneath. brIf the correct button is pressed it will reveal a green circular note icon in place of the question icon. brIf the incorrect button is pressed it will reveal a red incorrect icon in place of the question icon instead. brThen another question icon fades in to start the selection process again.br Heres what Ive Ive got so far, I hope this makes sense to someone who knows what theyre doing  Any help would be greatly appreciated.brI wish I could post a mockup screenshot with description to make things clearer.p  precode  ltDOCTYPE htmlgt lthtmlgt ltheadgt lth1gt array test 4lth1gt ltscriptgt   var noteList  new Arraya, as, b, c,q,x  var notes  new Array6  var buttonList  new Arrayabtn, asbtn, bbtn, cbtn  var buttons  new Array4   function initialize        notes[0]  new Image50, 50      notes[0].src  A.png      notes[1]  new Image50, 50       notes[1].src  As.png       notes[2]  new Image50, 50      notes[2].src  B.png       notes[3]  new Image50, 50      notes[3].src  C.png      notes[4]  new Image50, 50      notes[4].src  question.png      notes[5]  new Image50, 50      notes[5].src  wrong.png        buttons[0]  new Image50, 50      buttons[0].src  Abtn.png      buttons[1]  new Image50, 50      buttons[1].src  Asbtn.png      buttons[2]  new Image50, 50      buttons[2].src  Bbtn.png      buttons[3]  new Image50, 50      buttons[3].src  Cbtn.png         function upDate    ifbuttons[0]  notes[0]         document.imgDisplay.src  notes[0].src       ltscriptgt   ltheadgt   ltbody onLoad  initializegt  ltcentergt   ltform name  myFormgt  ltimg src  question.png   name  imgDisplay   height  100   width  100gt   ltformgt   ltcentergt     ltdiv gt   ltinput typeimage   onClickupDate srcAbtn.png    stylewidth60pxheight60pxgt                              ltinput typeimage   onClickupDate srcAsbtn.png    stylewidth60pxheight60pxgt   ltinput typeimage  onClickupDate srcBbtn.png    stylewidth60pxheight60pxgt        ltinput typeimage  onClickupDate srcCbtn.png   stylewidth60pxheight60pxgt         ltdivgt         ltbodygt lthtmlgt codepre

Negative 2893 pI have a service implemented in Java which depends on 3 property files. I have defined define for each of the property file in a common properties module and consuming them from service specific module. The define for one of the property file is shown belowp  precodedefine propertiesrabbitmq    propertyfile,   servicename,   rabbitmqhost,   rabbitmqusername,   rabbitmqpassword,   rabbitmqport,   rabbitmqvhost    file  propertyfile     ensure  gt file,     content gt templateconfigrabbitmq.properties.erb,     mode    gt 0644,     notify  gt Service[servicename],     codepre  pI am following roles and profile pattern in my puppet code and doing all hiera lookups in service specific profile. Now because of this whenever there is a change in property files, I need to make cascading changes to all of my puppet modules that consumes that property file. The changes are needed in profile hiera lookup, module init.pp additionremoval of parametes from constructor and config.pp parameter adjustment when invoking define for a property file.p  pI feel that the above problem can be solved by incorporating hiera lookups in define for a property file, like thisp  precodedefine propertiesrabbitmq propertyfile, servicename,     rabbitmqhost  hierarabbitmqhost   rabbitmqusername  hierarabbitmqusername   rabbitmqpassword  hierarabbitmqpassword   rabbitmqport  hierarabbitmqport   rabbitmqvhost  hierarabbitmqvhost    file  propertyfile     ensure  gt file,     content gt templateconfigrabbitmq.properties.erb,     mode    gt 0644,     notify  gt Service[servicename],     codepre  pBut, above is a violation of roles and profile pattern. The above is doing hiera lookup in a module instead of doing it in profile. Now, the module has a tight dependency on hiera. It being an internal module not meant for puppet forge, I guess, it should be OK to violate the guideline in favor of code maintainability.p  pI seek opinion from others on above.p

Negative 2893 pIm having problem with collision detection with my C game. I first tried AABB and successfully got it to detect collision but the problem was that I want to be able to push each other so I went with a basic solution to push both objects back half of the distance penetrated. But that only pushed the objects to a 45 degree angle to each other.a hrefhttpi.imgur.comqoToiMK.gif relnofollowLink to GIF explaining what i meanap  pstrongIF YOU DONT WANT TO READ SKIP THIS PARAGRAPHstrongp  pSo I figured that I need an direction to push the objects in, so I tried to modify some code from a tutorial. The direction is a normalized vector between the center of both objects. And then half of the collision depth is multiplied with the normalized vector so they get pushed in the opposite direction of each other. This worked but it used circular collisionit used radius  radius to calculate collision depth and this meant that I couldnt use rectangles with different width and height, for instance 32x64 48x32I had to use 32x32 48x48 64x64 and so on and so forth. This is a big problem because strongI NEED TO BE ABLE TO USE TEXTURES WITH DIFFERENT WIDTH AND HEIGHTstrong.p  pSo once again a went back to AABB and got it to work with out being able to push each other, so you just come to a complete stop. But the problem here is that when I collide on one axis I cant move in the other. For example, if I hold down UP and LEFT and collide with a wall on the LEFT i come to a complete stop instead of continue going UP where there is no wall.p  pstrongSO WHAT I WANT HELP WITH ISstrong either AABB collision where objects push each other with half of the distance penetrated in the correct direction or just plain AABB where you come to a complete stop strongBUTstrong are able to walk in the non colliding direction when colliding on the other axis, for example a hrefhttpi.imgur.comtwe1n8L.gif relnofollowHolding down up and down would result in thisap

Negative 2893 pI have become a bit stuck while testing an angularJS directive. It is a fairly simple directive, Im creating a template, creating an isolated scope bound both ways via  and a link function that links a watcher to the DOM for the val parameter.

Negative 2893 pI have a large weighted least squares system with millions of observations. I cant store the least squares matrix in memory, so I only store the normal equations matrixp  pAT W Ap  pwhere A is nbyp and W  diagw1,...,wn. It takes a emveryem long time to build this normal equations matrix due to the large number of observations. However, I also want to iteratively reweight the observations to reduce the effect of outliers, and so at the next iteration, the weight matrix will be the product of the original weights W with some new weights V  diagv1,...,vn. Therefore I need to construct the matrixp  pAT W Ap  pwhere W  diagw1v1, w2v2, ..., wnvn.p  pDoes anyone know of a slick fast way to get the matrix AT W A from the matrix AT W A I am hoping I dont need to start over from scratch to build AT W A, since it takes so long.p  pI did search the literature and didnt find much on this topic.p

So I used from astsa package sarimajj, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 2, 12 to fit the model.  I get the following resultsp  precode    Coefficients              ar1     sma1     sma2  constant           0.7456  0.7469  0.1032    6e04     s.e.  0.0272   0.0405   0.0429     8e04      sigma2 estimated as 0.1201  log likelihood  223.17,  aic  456.33      AIC     [1] 1.106286      AICc     [1] 1.102856      BIC     [1] 2.077418 codepre  pNow I would like to generate a new SARIMA1, 0, 0x0, 1, 212 model, feed it the variance and parameters I just found, plus the first few values of my time series, then simulate say 500 values, in order to compare the simulated data to the real data in terms of mean, variance, skewness, etc.  Is there a function in R to do this  Or am I going about things the wrong way  I thought about using Arima from the forecast package to create the model, then feeding it new starting values say the first 24 values of my original time series data, then having it predict future values.  But I am concerned this does not preserve my variance, and I want to do it as if I didnt have all the data, just the 24 starting values and the parameters of the model.  Thanksp

And if I wanted to store a generator in a different class I would have to make that class a template class with the generator as template parameter like thisp  precodetemplate lttypename generatortgt class foo      generatort gen  codepre  pA way to generalize the use of those generators would be to abstract them into a function object of type codestdfunctionltintgtcode and then write a method which returns such a function object generator given an ordinary generator from codeltrandomgtcode like so optionally with a distribution includedp  precodetemplate lttypename generatortgt stdfunctionltintgt creategeneratorgeneratortamp gen     return [gen]         return gen       codepre  pSimilarly one could also create a class that abstracts all other functions available in the ordinary generators. In both cases it would unnecessarily lower the performance because of these indirections.p  pSince I generate a huge amount of random numbers I need the process to be as efficient as possible while also enabling me to swap out generators or distributions without having to rewrite any code. I dont like the option of making all the classes that use random number generation template classes with the generator type as template parameter just because the generators defined in codeltrandomgtcode dont have a common base. Is there any other way to accomplish thisp

Negative 2893 pThis post is quiet long and I will be very grateful to everybody who reads it until the end. p  pI am experimenting execution python code issues and would like to know if you have a better way of doing what I want to. I explain my problem brifely. I have plenty solar panels measurements. Each one of them is done each 3 minutes. Unfortunately, some measurements can fail. The goal is to compare the time in order to keep only the values that have been measured in the same minutes and then retrieve them. A GUI is also included in my software, so each time the user changes the panels to compare, the calculation has to be done again. To do so, I have implemented 2 parts, the first one creates a vector of true or false for each panel for each minute, and the second compare the previous vector and keep only the common measures.p  pAll the datas are contained in the pandas df energiesDatas. The relevant columns arep  ul liname contains the name of the panel length 1li lidate contains the day of the measurement length 1li lilisttime contains a list of all time of measurement of a day length Nli lilistenergyprod  contains the corresponding measures length Nli ul  pThe first part loop over all possible minutes from beginning to end of measurements.

Negative 2893 pIve got some sensitive information that I want to be encrypted and stored in Azure Table Storage. Honestly, from a naive approach, using the same AES key for all values probably would be sufficient as I would nowhere near approach having enough data encrypted in order for someone to do any meaningful cryptanalysis. But, I know that the best practice is to limit usage of the same symmetric key.p  pRecently, Microsoft released client side encryption for Azure Table Storage via Azure KeyVault. It allows you to generate an RSA key and store it in KeyVault and the client library will generate a new symmetric key for every row in table storage and it encrypts the symmetric key with your RSA key. This is perfect because there is no way to do differential cryptanalysis on the ciphertext since they all used different keys. It is especially nice because their library does all the plumbing, all you have to do is grab your RSA key from KeyVault, decorate your designated properties with the codeEncryptPropertyAttributecode and it handles everything else.p  pTherein lies the rub... I personally find KeyVault kind of obtuse to use and manage. You have to use powershell to set up oauth authentication between your app and keyvault and it looks like a tremendous amount of overhead for storing a single RSA key. If we have hundreds of keys to store, I can imagine it would be much more useful. p  pIs there any way to use all of Microsofts client side encryption code without storing the RsaKey in the KeyVaultp
