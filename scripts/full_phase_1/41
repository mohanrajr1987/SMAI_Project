Positive 41 pI have a report that consists of a single column tablix with a single row that is grouped. Inside the row are three sub reports. The Header of the report is supposed to display three pieces of information unique to the data that the row is grouped on so the header is unique for each. p  pI attempted to populate the data in the header by having hidden controls in the body that I then referenced in the expressions of the controls in the header. This method didnt work. So I switched to a different possible solution I found which was to populate variables using VB and reference them in the header using codeCode.variableNamecode in the expression. The function to populate the variables is called from a hidden control in the body which passes the data as parameters. p  pThis method worked. However, it only seems to work on my local machine and one of my coworkers machines in BIDS preview. When the report is published to the report server, it runs and everything seems fine, except the header values dont populate.p  pOne of the variables is an integer and the other two are strings. The integer value is initialized to 0 and in the report from the report server it shows the initialized value of 0, but the strings are still blank. This makes me think that the function isnt being called or there might be a scope issue Or it could be something completely different that Im not familiar with. Possibly a configuration issue with the report serverp  pHere is the report a hrefhttpi.stack.imgur.comGOt6B.png relnofollowimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comGOt6B.png altScreenshot of the report designerap  pIf you can see the tiny little control about halfway down the report on the left side.

Negative 41 pIll be quick and honest Im currently trying to write a clientserver for an online game. Since Im poor and limited on resources, Ill be testing the bare basics of the server using a PHP backend, with the eventual goal being to rebuild the server end in C.p  pIm looking for a C library for Windows XP and Vista preferably that will let me use a finite number of threads, one dedicated to each piece of the networking problem. As an example, I want to use a thread to report the positional information of the player to the server and to receive responses about positional information of the other players but I want a different thread to background download in the 3D artwork for the areaplayers, and a different thread for the built in chat system, etc. These all need to be fairly independent of one another.p  pI know what I want to emdoem with the library, Ive got the design bit figured out, I just feel a bit silly reinventing the wheel, since I know that a good library for this exact purpose probably already exists. So, what are your suggestions I need to be able to send data to a server, and accept responses. Ideally, the request needs to trigger an Event when its done so I can immediately grab the data and do something with it and I need to be able to handle multiple transactions simultaneously. HTTP is a nice bonus, but I can handle HTTP protocol myself if necessary, especially considering that I plan on dropping it in the long run.p  pThanksp

Still, the two classes consumer and producer implements singletons, so they actually use default constructors meaning, no parameters.

Negative 41 pI need to parse amp process a big set of semistructured text basically, legal documents  law texts, addendums to them, treaties, judges decisions, .... The most fundamental thing Im trying to do is extract information on how subparts are structured  chapters, articles, subheadings, ... plus some metadata. My question is if anyone can point me to starting points for this type of text processing, because Im sure there has been a lot of research into this but what I find is mostly on either parsing something with a strict grammar like code or completely freeform text like google tries to do on webpages. I think if I get hold of the right keywords, I would have more success in google and my journal databases. Thanks.p

Negative 41 pThis is a question for ObjectiveJCappuccino, but I added the cocoa tag since the frameworks are so similar.p  pOne of the downsides of Cappuccino is that CoreData hasnt been ported over yet, so you have to make all your model objects manually.p  pIn CoreData, your inverse relationships get managed automatically for you... if you add an object to a tomany relationship in another object, you can traverse the graph in both directions.p  pWithout CoreData, is there any clean way to setup those inverse relationships automatically p  pFor a more concrete example, lets take the typical Department and Employees example. To use rails terminology, a Department object hasmany Employees, and an Employee belongsto a Department.p  pSo our Department model has an NSMutableSet or CPMutableSet  employees that contains a set of Employees, and our Employee model has a variable department that points back to the Department model that owns it.p  pIs there an easy way to make it so that, when I add a new Employee model into the set, the inverse relationship employee.department automatically gets set Or the reverse If I set the department model of an employee, then it automatically gets added to that departments employee setp  pRight know Im making an object, ValidatedModel that all my models subclass, which adds a few methods that setup the inverse relationships, using KVO. But Im afraid that Im doing a lot of pointless work, and that theres already an easier way to do this.p  pCan someone put my concerns to restp

Negative 41 pI am trying to find the best way to pass complex configurations in a Spring webapp running in Tomcat. Currently I use JNDI to pass data sources and strings from the Tomcat context into the webapp, and this works well. p  pBut, lets say I need to select the implementation of a notification service. There is no way that Spring can conditionally select which bean to instantiate although in the past I have used a JNDI string to import a predefined configuration of beans by setting contextConfigLocation. p  pIve also seen many webapps which supply a configuration tool which will create a custom WAR file. In my opinion this is bad form, if for no other reason than it prevents the redeployment of WARs from upstream without many checks to ensure all the configuration has been reapplied.p  pIdeally I would be able to supply a Spring XML file which existed on the filesystem, outside of the webapp. But, the spring import directive does not seem to resolve  variables, making it impossible to supply customisations.p  pAre there any techniques I can employ here to properly separate complex configuration from the webappp

Negative 41 pI have a class API which has full code coverage and uses DI to mock out all the logic in the main class function Job.Run which does all the work.p  pI found a bug in production where we werent doing some validation on one of the data input fields.p  pSo, I added a stub function called ValidateFoo... Wrote a unit test against this function to Expect a JobFailedException, ran the test  it failed obviously because that function was empty. I added the validation logic, and now the test passes.p  pGreat, now we know the validation works. Problem is  how do I write the test to make sure that ValidateFoo is actually called inside Job.Run ValidateFoo is a private method of the Job class  so its not an interface...p  pIs there anyway to do this with NMock2.0 I know TypeMock supports fakes of non interface types. But changing mock libs right now is not an option. At this point if NMock cant support it, I will simply just add the ValidateFoo call to the Run method and test things manually  which obviously Id prefer not to do considering my Job.Run method has 100 coverage right now. Any Advice Thanks very much it is appreciated.p  pemstrongEDIT the other option I have in mind is to just create an integration test for my Job.Run functionality injecting to it true implementations of the composite objects instead of mocks. I will give it a bad input value for that field and then validate that the job failed. This works and covers my test  but its not really a unit test but instead an integration test that tests one unit of functionality.... hmm..emstrongp  pEDIT2 IS there any way to do tihs Anyone have ideas Maybe TypeMock  or a better designp

Negative 41 pIm trying to create a particular effect where I have a bunch of particles on the screen which leave trails that slowly fade.

Negative 41 pI have an slightly unusual security requirement, and Im looking for advice on best practice, or atleast nonbrittle approaches.p  pScenario Intranet system. Data about a number of related entities is to be considered as private. This is known as the unpublished part of the system. Only certain users can access this data. At some stage the users make a selection from this data, mark some records and publish them to the published side. The data published to the published side is removed from the unpublished side. The bulk of the systems users can then work on the records in the published side.p  pI know this sounds like a bool field on a parent record, flagging as published or unpublished, but let me explain how the system we are replacing tackles the issue  this is the level of security we need to emulate. It is a flat file database Dataflex with the unpublished and published data in separate tables, on separate server drives, backed up to separate tapes, in different rooms, with physical access by different people. Network rights ensure that the published users cannot get at the unpublished data. The software also manages rights, but if that goes wrong, or a programmer makes a mistake, they still cant access the wrong data. Sys admins who could potentially broach this data have positive vetted security clearance.p  pSo what I am looking for is advice on how to achieve an architecture with MVC, EF4, SQL that achieves this. At one extreme I build two systems with two sql databases, different rights potentially with the differences contained within web.config so its actually the same codebase. At the other end of the scale its the flag in the table with controller methods marked up to deny access. Thats no good because if a programmer messes up say a search query and it returns data from the wrong category, and it makes it out of the building unnoticed, its likely to result in human sacrifice, dogs and cats living together... mass hysteriap  pSorry for the lengthy description.

Negative 41 pId like to add implicit conversions to Java classes generated by a modeling tool. So I want to add them to the companion object of those classes, so that the compiler automatically finds them. But I cannot add them in a separate file, because the companion has to be defined in the same file. Is there anything I can do about thisp  pOf course, I can define all my implicit conversions in another object and then bring it into scope, but this requires an extra import. Any other solutionp

Is there any way to prevent this Like, is there any way to check the file size with a validator, but without the need to load up the entire file before checkingp
Negative 41 pJust had an end client experience a nightmare that is mysterious. He began the process of adding an ad hoc prototype of app. He is saying that when he added the mobile Team Provisioning Profile that is associated with the app and the device synched, all of his apps got wiped.p  pI witnessed a designer go through the same process without any of this nightmare.p  pAny ideas what might have happened and more importantly how to avoid this from happening againp  pI am praying that iTunes is smart enough to see he already purchased his apps and will just reinstall without making him pay for it again.p
Negative 41 pHow do I pass data using an http post from an Android app using Java to a php file on a IIS serverp
Negative 41 pIn the latest two weeks, without releasing an update to my app, I have started getting a bunch of reports with corrupted databases. Below is the stacktrace. Android cannot open the database, and neither could the sqlitemanager program on my computer. However, the SQLite manageraddon to firefox could open it. After running the command compact database, the database was fixed and I could open it in android. Is there any way I could do something like this within my app The big problem is that I cannot even attempt to open the database, because newer versions of Android will immediately delete and replace the database, as you can see in the stacktrace below.

Negative 41 pI have defined a vertex class which, when combined, form a graph. these vertices receive input on one end and produce output on the other both of these sides can have 0, 1, or more subscriptions of other instances of this vertex class The types for both the incoming and outgoing data are independent of each other and are specified as template parameters as these vertices must operate on all kinds of inoutput types.p  pSo in code this becomesp  precodetemplateltclass incomingDataType, class OutgoingDataTypegt     class Vertex ... codepre  pBefore sending out the received data, a vertex can apply a filter function to transformfilter the data before sending it back out again to its list subscribers. This function is declared as a pure virtual function as the functionality of it depends on the kind of specialization class inheriting from this virtual vertex base class.p  pThis means the filter is declared asp  precodeOutgoingDataType filterincomingDataType data  0  codepre  pOf course I want to link together multiple vertices to each other.

Ive already fiddled with boostany wont compile, void pointers wont compile, using function templates instead of class templates wont work due to virtual filter function... but nothing I can think of works.p  pSo in short, Im looking for a way to have a strongDontCareTypestrong type as a template parameter, if that is possible at all, which is basically a way of saying the template parameter I mark as I dont care can be of any type, because I dont use its data anywayp  pAs a last resort to get a working solution, Im also considering the option of using a kind of VertexData type, which must then be the base class of any incoming or outgoing data types used in the vertices.

Negative 41 pI have the need to create a plugin system that will have dependency support and Im not sure the best way to account for dependencies.   The plugins will all be subclassed from a base class, each with its own codeexecutecode method.  In each plugin class, Id planned to create a codedependenciescode attribute as a list of all the other plugins it depends on.p  pWhen loading the plugins, I would import all of them and put them in a list and sort them based on the dependencies.  Once they are all in the correct order so anything with a dependency is in the list after its said dependencies Id loop through the list executing each methods codeexecutecode method.p  pWhere Im keep getting fuzzy is the logic behind the sorting.  I can just start putting them in alphabetical order until i come across one that has a dependency if its dependencies is not in the list yet, put it into a tmp list.  at the end of the first round of imports, start at the end of the temp list  a list with nothing but plugins that have dependencies and check the run list again. if i find its dependencies in the run list make sure it has a higher index number than its highest dependency.  If its dependencies are not in the list, hold off on it and move to the next plugin in the temp list.  Once i get to the end of the tmp list, start back at the top and try again.  Once either all the plugins are sorted, or the tmp list doesnt change size after looping over it start executing plugins.p  pWhat would be left in the temp list are plugins that either dont have theyre dependencies found, or have a circular dependency. 2 plugins in the tmp list that depend on one anotherp  pIf youre still reading AND you were able to follow my logic is this a sound plan Is there a simpler way  If i wanted to implement sequence numbers for execute order, is there an easy way to have both sequence and dependencies with dependencies beating sequencing if there was a conflict Or should a plugin use a sequence OR dependencies Run the plugins with sequence numbers first, than the ones with dependenciesp  pstrongTLDRstrongp  pHow would you write the logic for calculating dependencies in a plugin systemp  hr  pstrongEditstrongp  pAlright I think I implemented the Topological sort from the wikipedia page following its logic example for the DFS.

Negative 41 pI have the following code that I wish to use to select all the elements I will need in a certain sequence. Heres the snippetp  precode            XmlDocument schema  new XmlDocument             schema.LoadSchemaFileName             XmlNamespaceManager xnm  new XmlNamespaceManagerschema.NameTable             xnm.AddNamespacexs, httpwww.w3.org2001XMLSchema             XmlNodeList list  schema.SelectNodesPath codepre  pHowever, Im not sure what I should write as the path. Ideally I want to select all the child nodes of the sequence tag, but when I set the Path to sequence, that doesnt give me anything when I run it. The nodelist is just blank. What Im trying to do is get the names of the elements that I will need in order for the validation of an xml file. p  pAdditionally, when I set the Path as name, I do get something, however, that selects all of the elements with name as an attribute. The ones I want are specifically right after the sequence tag.p  pIve also tried setting the Path as xssequence, but that gives me an error Namespace Manager or XsltContext needed. This query has a prefix, variable, or userdefined function. Which is weird because I thought I set it up already.. p  pAny help is appreciated Thanks If you need any more information Ill be happy to provide it.p  pSincerely,p  ptf.rzp  pEDIT I am using Visual Studio C 2008. .NET 3.5 SP1p  pThe basic premise is related to another question i have posted regarding the reordering of datatable columns. But to shorten the explanation. I only need to say that I just simply need the names of the elements that the xsd schema will validate in the proper order. I have a few xsd schemas, all of which follow the same format and are very, very static files. Thus, I know that I can safely look for the sequence tag and get all its child nodes. While Michael mentioned how there are many ways to write a schema, the schemas that I am working with are all similar and static in those regards, so if I am able to do this, it will work 100 of the time. p
Negative 41 pI feel like this is a question thats likely to have been answered already, but Im having trouble finding it. Chalk it up to bad search terms, perhaps.p  pIve been working in Visual Studio 2005 Professional for about a month now, and thus far Ive been using the builtin compile mechanism with mostlydefault settings the only thing Ive changed with any real frequency is the build path. Id like, however, to move to using more automated build techniques. To that end, Id like to switch to using codecsccode calls instead of hitting codeCtrlShiftBcode or codeF5code, so that I can include the lines in build scripts and other tools like NAnt. p  pMy question is, does Visual Studio or any third party tool provide a way to programmatically convert the compile setting ins VS to its codecsccode equivalent For example, if I have a project called SampleProject with the codeOutput typecode field set to Windows Application, it would look something likep  precodecsc outputwinexe targetSampleProject.exe .cs codepre  pI know its usually not terribly difficult to work this out by hand, but if theres a way to automatically pull it together, its that much better.p

Negative 41 pIm new to Objective C and unfortunately also to the project I am working on. I was given a small sample project that refers to work from my predecessors in C and uses it for an iPhone app Objective C. Rather than extending the sample it was quick n dirty and I didnt wanna mess around in it I created a new project from scratch for my stuff. To get it working I need to set up the same links to the previous libraries as the other one, but although in my settings I cant find any differences to the existing project it wont do the trick.p  pWith the help of colleagues and Google I reached thisp  p1 The project includes two library files, libyid.a and libvrpn.a, via Xcodes Add files dialogue. It automatically added the libraries paths to the Library Search Paths in the Build Settings and the files show in the projects folder structure in XCode. strikeAs far as I can tell this bit seems not to cause problems.strike Edit if i remove these files from the project I get the same errors. Im now thinking that XCode can resolve the headers, but cant find the implementation and that the libraries may have been there but not been properly set upp  p2 One of my custom classes uses p  precodeimport DisplayYid.h codepre  pI added the path to the files location to the Header Search Paths in the Build Settings and it seems to be found alright.

In addition, all the class definitions in the headers that DisplayYid itself includes yield p  pcodeerror expected , ,, , asm or attribute before declspeccodep  pMy knowledge here is unfortunately very limited, but it seems to me that XCode can find the headers in question, but somehow would expect the content in a different formatlanguage  When I had DisplayYid.h included as a file in the project hierarchy I tried to set its file type in the file inspector to C header as suggested by some hits I found on Google for my problem, but this doesnt change a thing.  I feel I am missing some tiny but crucial detail, but am not surefooted enough in any of this to test around further.

Negative 41 pI am trying to execute an executable file and a perl script from within a java program. I have found many topics similar to this but most of them refer to windows. I know java is platform independent and it should work anyways but it doesnt. The solution I have tried already is the one based on the java Runtime and its exec method. It works just fine on windows but since Im porting my program on linux I need to adapt it. As I said I need to execute an executable file that I have compiled and was written in c which it looks like its working but it finishes executing with an exit value of 1. I have no idea what it means but on windows it exits with 0 and thats how it should be on linux as well . The pearl script on the other hand does not start at all. I use the command perl script.pl and it exits with a value of 255.

Negative 41 pIm starting off building a site which should be responsive to different screen sizes. Im using the Fluid Baseline Grid template which uses percentages for columns and adjusts according to screen sizes using media queries. Now that Im adding my own custom CSS, I am wondering whether I should be using pixels, percentages or ems for positioning my elements within the fluid grid elements. For example, margins and padding between divs, widths of input fields etc. Font sizes and line heights are the only things set to use ems for measurement. p  pCan anyone provide any pointers on this At the moment Im leaning towards just using pixels within the percentage based layout that the grid template has preset.p
Negative 41 pI have one questionp  precodelet totalAmount  1400.0M let allocations  [ 0.45M 0.45M 0.1M ] let minAmount  250.0M codepre  pLets assume there is 1400 to allocate to 3 parties, the minimum amount to allocate is 250 and each party has different percentage of the total amount.  Here Party A amp B will get 45 of the total amount, and Party C will get 10, the allocated amount has to be number of times of the minimum amount. I want to write a function to get the resultp  precodelet allocated  [ 500.0M 500.0M 250.0M ] codepre  pBut I can not figure out a good way for the function.  The issue is for Party C, the amount of 10 of 1400 is only 140, which is less than 250, but since the Party A and B each has only 500, therefore, there is still 400 left, so Party C can still have 250 the minimum amount. If you have a good idea, please show me your code. Thanks, Johnp

Negative 41 pBefore I switched to iOS development via Monotouch I played around a bit with ObjectiveC. Ever since one thing has been on my mind emKey Value Coding KVCem. I have never understood what it is good for and what the magic behind it is.p  pFor my understanding it is just a collections of names and values, like .NETs codeNameValueCollectioncode Instead of setting codeanObject.Address  An address Valuecode you would write codeanObject.Properties[Address]  An address valuecode. Great. So what Because this appears to be too easy to me Im sure that cant be it. p  pOr is it because .NET has reflection and therefore has no need for something like KeyValueCoding I can grab the type of codeanObjectcode and use reflection to loop all of its properties and look for the one called Address and then use reflection to set the value. Is that maybe the analogy of KVCp  pIm hoping there is somebody out there whos a pro in ObjC and C.NET who can explain to me what the benefits are and how it would translate into .NET. Please dont just point me to Apples documentation. I know all that. Im trying to find out if something has been missing in my codinglife so far by not knowing KVC Or have I maybe been using something similar in .NET not being aware that it would translate into KVC if I was using ObjCp

Negative 41 pI am using an Oracle database that is having slow performance because of joins on some tables for getting results.  I am considering making a new table that stores some of this data so that it can be retrieved quickly without having to perform the joins.  Another alternative is to create a view for the joins I am performing and then always query the view for the data.  What is the tradeoff in performance between using a new table versus creating a view  I figured a view would still need to run the join so it would not offer as good performance as a new table.p  pInfo on Oracle database view is here      a hrefhttpdocs.oracle.comcdB1930601server.102b14200statements8004.htmhttpdocs.oracle.comcdB1930601server.102b14200statements8004.htma      a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions256700whatisaviewinoracleWhat is a View in Oracleap  pClarification based on responses below.  The queries are mostly optimized already so I do not want to do optimization.  Would prefer either a new table or a materialized view, but would like to know which might be better.  I am interested in performance.  Writing more code to keep the new table in sync with the old tables is not a problem.  I will just add modification statements wherever modifications were done to old tables.  I do not want to use a materialized view if it is slower than adding a new table.p  pThe difference is whether the refresh of the data is more efficient for materialized view or for a new table. For the new table, basically I will be adding update statements wherever there were updates to the old table. So when the user queries the new table, the data is already there no further processing needed. But for a materialized view, if the view refreshes itself only when the user queries the view, then this might be slower.p

Think how in most forums when you delete a comment its generally text saying delete comment instead of a submit button.p  pId like to avoid using GET in this case because its for deleting content. I understand OOP so I dont need an explanation of how it works.p  pIs there any way to do this with text saying delete not a button and then use objects to pass it to a function, instead of using a hyperlink to pass valuesp  pHeres what Im currently using to display the link, however, I use get to retrieve the values, which I would really like to avoid. p  precodelttdgtlta hrefprofile.phpuseridlt echo request[userid] gtampactiondeletegtlt echo request[username] gtltagtlttdgt  lttdgtlta hrefprofile.phpuserid.    requestID[userID].gtDeleteltagtlttdgt codepre
Negative 41 pI needed to store some data related to class periods in an Android project.  After looking at my options, I thought a SQL database would be a good choice.

Negative 41 pI have a PHP script on my site that is called using the jquery ajax function. Basically the user presses a button on my site and it sends an ajax call to this PHP script, which then uses procopen to call a python script on my server. This all works fine when I test it in firefox, but when I test it in other browsers chrome, safari, mobile safari the script infinite loops. I have also tried calling the PHP script directly by pasting the url into the browser to check if its an infinite loop in my jquery and I get the same result runs fine in ff, but infinite loops in all other browsers. From what I understand PHP code is executed server side and then the output is sent to the client browser so I cannot figure out why the script is only running in firefox. Ive also tried SSHing into my server and running the python script from command line and it runs fine, so I dont think its a problem with the python script. p  pHeres my php codep  precodeltphp require..includeconstants.php sessionstart ifissetSESSION[loggedin]SESSION[loggedin]      headerlocation..login.php  link  mysqlconnectDBSERVER,DBUSER,DBPASSWORD mysqlselectdbDBNAME q  SELECT cupiduser,cupidpass FROM users WHERE email.SESSION[email].

Negative 41 pThis question is more philosophical than technical.p  pIve trained myself as a web developer back when web developers were called webmasters and my tool of choice was FrontPage, moving onto Evrsoft 1st Page 2000.p  pThat was the last time I used an HTML image map.p  pNow its HTML5, AJAX, vector canvasses, CSS 3D, jQuery, local storage, touchscreen Safari, you name it. The image map has faded into an obscurity where not even Google comes up with too many relevant results a mandatory W3C Schools entry and some forum posts from 2004.p  pObviously creating a website navigation or similar triviality using an image map was a bad idea back then and it certainly is inexcusable today.p  pBut right now I have a task to create a polygon clickable area on top of a div with a background image.p  pId have no issue doing this in image map since it seems like it was designed for a use case exactly like this, and while Ive done no tests, I couldnt imagine any browser dropping support for an element that worked beautifully for years. But I cant help but think that there must be a better way to do this today.p  pMy web creation philosophy is to develop for IE5.5, and then design for Chrome edge. This means that the site first needs to work on a basic level on even the most antiquated browser, and then start adding JS amp CSS to make it more beautiful, more usable, faster, simpler, friendlier and better.p  pAs such, while I know I could do a canvas in Raphal and add all kinds of snazzy hover effects and things, I think making functionality as simple as this shouldnt require a 89 kb or X kb JS library. Or even JS at all.p  pI dont know if CSS3 has capabilities to define polygonal areas, but while recognizing the great possibilities introduced by CSS3, I prefer keeping anything defined there as nonessential flair that would degrade gracefully.p  pSo in todays webdev world, what would be the most crossbrowser way to define a polygonal click area preferably in a way thats grabbable by a jQuery code.hovercode, or at least a CSS codehovercode, that isnt dependent on JavaScript or CSS attributes available in a minority of browsers Is image map really the only way to do it What of mobile devicesp

Negative 41 pIm creating a QtC application using QML for some parts. Under windows I would like to make use of the translucent windowing using ExtendFrameIntoClientArea as seen in this snippet from my window class.p  precodeifdef QWSWIN     if  QSysInfowindowsVersion  QSysInfoWVVISTA           QSysInfowindowsVersion  QSysInfoWVWINDOWS7               EnableBlurBehindWidgetthis, true         ExtendFrameIntoClientAreathis      else codepre  pThe code is working nicely with one exception. If the transparent window system is turned off the background becomes black, and as part of my UI is transparent it becomes dark as well. The same thing happens when logging in to a remote computer running the application, even if the transparent windowing system is reinitialized immediately the background stays black until the above code is executed again. This is demonstrated in this image a hrefhttpi.stack.imgur.comqNVv5.jpg relnofollowComparison of failed rendering in background and correct in front.ap  pThe problem is to find a signal to connect to reinitializing the transparent window, or better yet to detect when windows are drawn transparently and draw the UI accordingly. Any alternative solutions are also welcome.p

Negative 41 pI have a situation where I believe a workqueue and a SqlDependency would be a good fit, but Im having trouble piecing it all together.p  pLets say I have 1000 entities and each entity must be processed at different intervals i.e. 15, 30 or 45 minutes.

I need to partition the work items among the available processes without knowing how many listeners there are, could be 2 or 12 depending on which servers are online and which ones are offline for maintenance.p  pClients will be written in C.p  pAny known patterns, thoughts or direction would be very much appreciated.p
Negative 41 pI found out how handy it is to be able to use macros in Vim. In particular recording with codeqcode but Im confused about how to read what is stored in the register Im recording to.p  pTo take a specific example, I use Vim a lot for writing LaTeX documents, and in that connection I have made a macro that puts a codecode at the start of the current line, so that this code is commented out. I did this by recording as follows. I pressed the keys codeqcode codeucode kbdHomekbd codeicode codecode kbdEsckbd codeqcode. Now by pressing codeucode I am able to play that macro, and since I use that one a lot I decided to put it in my code.vimrccode file. I looked at the subject and found out that I have to use kbdCtrlkbdkbdVkbd to grab the keystrokes I use, e.g., the escape key. Ip  precodelet u[OHi[ codepre  pwhere I produced codeOHcode with kbdCtrlkbdkbdVkbd kbdHomekbd and code[code with kbdCtrlkbdkbdVkbd kbdEsckbd. Now when I start Vim the contents of register codeucode is code[OHi[code, as it ought to be, but if I just recorded the macro with codeqcode, then the register would readp  precodelt80gtkhi[ codepre  pI have tried to understand what this means. It does the same thing, but if I try to write something similar using kbdCtrlkbdkbdVkbd after consulting some of the help pages in Vim more precisely codehelp keynotationcode, codehelp iCTRLVcode and codehelp iCTRLVdigitcode, but I still dont understand it.p  pMy motivation for wanting to understand this is that I would like to be able to read what a macro I have recorded does. If I understand how the contents of the register is produced, then I might be able to understand it by producing a similar result. For example if the macros I recorded followed the same syntax as when using kbdCtrlkbdkbdVkbd then I could just check what kbdCtrlkbdkbdVkbd plus the most likely keystrokes produced and see which one matches.p

Negative 41 pI am working on a card game project in C. In this game, there are numerous events that are fired that the cards on the table need to subscribe to. However, I need the cards to dynamically subscribe and unsubscribe to the events so that the cards that are not currently active will not respond to the events being fired. p  pMy solution for this is to use an EventManager parent class, with one child for each event. Each of these managers will have subscribe  unsubscribe methods that take an EventHandler as a parameter. When called, the methods will subscribe  unsubscribe the provided handlers from the event assigned to that manager.p  pThe code below is a basic Console application that uses the same design pattern as my card game, and has the same issues.

Negative 41 pA few weeks ago I created a TurnBased 2player game running on iOS 5.p  pThe game allows the player to choose an opponent from their friends from its own interface, and then uses the playersToInvite property of GKMatchRequest when presenting the match making view, in order to make it automatically invite them. p  pContrary to the documentation which says it does nothing prior to iOS6, this has the effect of causing the GKTurnBasedMatchmakerViewController to automatically select the chosen player and start an invite when running on iOS5. p  pOn return of the request, inp  precode voidturnBasedMatchmakerViewControllerGKTurnBasedMatchmakerViewController viewController didFindMatchGKTurnBasedMatch match  codepre  pthis app then immediately carries out a turn and passes it to the next player.  This causes the actual invite to occur for the other player along with their turn, and the game proceeds nicely from there.p  pThe match.participants in the delegate call above both contain valid playerID properties, making the nextParticipant call possible and valid.p  pSo far, all so good, on iOS 5.p  pHowever, when running on iOS 6, everything proceeds as usual until we get to p  precode voidturnBasedMatchmakerViewControllerGKTurnBasedMatchmakerViewController viewController didFindMatchGKTurnBasedMatch match  codepre  pand we discover that the second participant has a nil playerID, and attempting to set it as the next participant fails with Unknown operation.p  pInvestigating further, if I start the match request as usual, but then cancel the invitation in the GC UI, and then invite again via the GC UI, it all works as expected. It is ONLY when setting the playersToInvite myself that the invite fails. I have confirmed the playerIDs are correct in all cases, except for the spurious nil on iOS6. p  pNote that this all behaves correctly when running on iOS5.p  pIt appears to me that Apple made it work in iOS5 and claimed that it didnt, and then broke it in iOS6 and claimed that it works p

Negative 41 pIt seems like a bit of an ommission that theres no easy way to create a userdefined function declaratively in Excel without defining a macro.

The trouble is how to pass parameters to that Ive seen a couple of tricks kludgy workarounds but not for xslx.p  pId like to be able to define a Breakeven function in another tab and reference it here passing in MORE THAN one parameter, two ranges in fact. Im sure theres some way using string parsing but I cant see it.p  pI dont mind if the function doesnt look exactly like that, as long as it evaluates within the cell and I can parse it for intent. For instance, this example a hrefhttpwww.jkpads.comarticlesExcelNames09.asp relnofollowhttpwww.jkpads.comarticlesExcelNames09.aspa which I was unable to get to work in xlsx uses this syntaxp  precodeIFROWD3,CellColor codepre  pWhere cellcolor is the name of the function and D3 is the range parameter. The other solution Im toying with is to define a function in column format with a variable argument list this is two rows of an excel spreadsheetp  precode[Value][function][parameter1][parameter2][parameter3]  24050  BreakEven C1C20      A1A20 codepre  pIts not pretty, but the benefit of the latter is that it describes the function to an external reader. We emknowem its a breakeven function, whereas if we put the emactualem formula OFFSET,INDIRECT,SUMetc it would not be readableparsable. Of course, in that case, Id have to construct the value field by parsing the cells to the right in Excel, which would make the Value formula messy but at least it would be a selfdescribing row.p  pCan anyone suggest a better methodp

Negative 41 pFirst said, this is my first experience using the Entity Framework so I apologize if this ends up being a newbie question.  Everything has gone well so far but, I run into a situation that I am not sure what the best way to handle is.  p  pI need to create a manytomany relationship but, the manytomany table contains more than just the composite key.

If I went the other way around and looked for 1s, then 2s may not exist dont want that anyway.p  pAt the end I wanna be able to average stuff out... So lets say if some submission first went from 1 to 2 in a time span of 5h the code that I left, will get me up to this point, then lets say it got reassigned to 1 and then it went back to 2 in a new time span of 6h, I wanna be able to get both and do the average, so 562. p  pThanksp

When I start the program from Visual Studio with F5, the problem occurs in the first call as well, but when I execute directly the binary .exe file, its working from the other thread it isnt  . If I switch the build from Debug to Release and starting it from Visual Studio with F5, the first call working again.p  pWhy does it happenp  pThanks for you help in advancep  pBest Regards, Zolip

Frame example  new Frame example.bytes[0]  127 example  processexample codepre  pObviously, in the rare event that the codeinputcode Frame object is recreated, it wont be the the exact same object. However, the end goal is that, under normal circumstances coderareEventcode registers false, the Frames codebytescode property will never be fully copied. This is because, in the actual scenario, it will be millions of bytes long, in a very timesensitive operation.p  pIn this particular case, Im not too concerned about whether the rest of the object is truly identical, only its properties. But, for the sake of completion, I may as well inquire to both If an object passed as a parameter is then returned, is it the emexactem same  object And in my particular case, will the objects properties avoid any costly copyingp

Negative 41 pI use the  prefix with my inline strings quite often, to support multiline strings or to make string with quotes a little more readable. Having to still double up the inline quotes is still somewhat of a pain, so this made me wonder if there was still another option in .net that would allow strings to maintain their doublequotes without requiring some form of delimiting Something like a CDATA section in xml Ive searched a bit and didnt find anything, but thought Id ask here in case Ive overlooked some .Net feature perhaps even a recent one in version 4 or 4.5p  pupdate Ive found that vb.net has XML Literals that allow defining xml snippets directly inline with the source.

So codeCcode might refer to codeabstract class Catcode, and codeDcode might refer to codeabstract class Dogcode.li liThe second character optionally indicates the subtype of the animal... except these subtypes are grouped into categories as far as classes go. So a codeCScode might be codeThaiCat extends Catcode with argument codeSiamesecode and codeCKcode might be a codeThaiCat extends Catcode with argument codeKoratcode, and codeCBcode might be codeAmericaCat extends Catcode with argument codeBengalcodeli liThe codedatacode codeStringcode has other information in it. For example, it might have the name of the Animal. Dont worry about how to parse this data, this code would be shared between the codeabstract classcode which can parse the things that are true for all codeCatcode subtypes, and the subclass will parse out the rest of the needed data.li ul  pFirst solution, start with thisp  precodepublic enum AnimalType    CAT C  Animal makeAnimalString data  return CatType.makeCatdata ,   DOG D  Animal makeAnimalString data  return DogType.makeDogdata    private char type   public char getType  return type    private AnimalTypechar type  this.type  type    abstract Animal makeAnimalString data    private static MapltCharacter, AnimalTypegt animalMap  new HashMapltgt   static      forAnimalType currentType  AnimalType.values        animalMap.putcurrentType.getType, currentType           public static Animal makeAnimalString data      return animalMap.getdata.charAt0.makeAnimaldata      public enum CatType    BENGAL B  Cat makeCatString data  return new AmericaCatdata, this ,   RAGDOLL R  Cat makeCatString data  return new AmericaCatdata, this ,   KORAT K  Cat makeCatString data  return new ThaiCatdata, this ,   SIAMESE S  Cat makeCatString data  return new ThaiCatdata, this     private char type   public char getType  return type    private CatTypechar type  this.type  type    abstract Cat makeCatString data, CatType type    private static MapltCharacter, CatTypegt catMap  new HashMapltgt   static      forCatType currentType  CatType.values        catMap.putcurrentType.getType, currentType           static Cat makeCatString data      return catMap.getdata.charAt1.makeCatdata     codepre  pThis is all well and good, it should be fast and clean, proper code delegation, etc. HOWEVER.

The problem is, I cant inject a factory into an Enumeration instance, and Guice recommends not using static injections. Thus, I have to pass my factory all the way down the method chain, which seems to defeat the purpose. Also, this doesnt solve the problem of disallowing the wrong constructor to be called by the wrong String.li liCreate a manual factory object.

Negative 41 pIm working on a proyect which is divided in two parts. The firs one is some kind of text visualizer in the console wich involves thatthe user can navigate within the text with the arrow keys. p  pnow, i dont have even a clue of how can i solve this, the biggest thing ive done in nasm was a regular expresion analizer, thats all. i imagine that i should display the text but at the end, not give back the control to the OS. the bottom 3 lines, p  precodemov eax, 1 mov ebx, 0  int 80h codepre  pso then i can start capturing the arrow keys. so, if the user press the up arrow key, a pointer moves 80 spaces back in the buffer that contains the text and so on with the rest of the keys. thats for editingp  pi really dont know if this is even possible, but any recomendation or advice or a link to where i can investigate a littlr bit more would be awesomep

Negative 41 pIm working on a single form application where I intend to open modal dialogs only. Its purpose is mostly taking input from the user to create objects to store in a database.p  ol lipDo I have need for a screen conductor or will a Window Manager suffice Ive tried reading all I can on the subject but still Im not sure. p  pI would like the benefit of not closing down modal dialogs if a certain amount of data hasnt been filled in, so I assume this would be classed as lifecycle management, thus forcing me to use a conductor, or can just the Window Manager handle it I was under the impression that anything that opens a new window cant be done with the conductorpli lipAlso, which is better in terms of wpf Ive read about passing an instance of the window manager to each class that needs it, but also about raising an event that one class listens for and opens a window as specified in the event. Would this latter be bad as it forms a tight relationship between each class and the event handling classpli ol  pThanksp

Negative 41 pI am new to Three.js  WebGL and am building a halfgame, halfmusic visualizer that involves many different geometries that move through the scene in various ways. Ive researched optimization as best I can, and followed a lot of advice  Ive combined a lot of my repeated geometries for example, each cube geometry that makes one building in the city into large GeometryUtils merges, Ive removed some textures, and Iv reduced the curve segments of my text geometries to just 1. But my apps performance still varies between 40 fps pretty good, on a gaming computer to 20 fps on my 15 inch Macbook, to just 1 fps seemingly randomly on various friends computers. p  pOne thing that I havent been able to get rid of, which I know to be costly, is the constant updating of vertices. I have a large mesh of Three.js text geometries, which I render all at the same time in an attempt to optimize. They need to look like they are falling from the sky  so I gave each text geometry an increasingly high y position, and I decrement the y position of each vertex by 5 each frame using a for loop.p  pI am also updating a lot of aspects of geometries during each frame, so that they respond to the music which is loaded up as a buffer through the Web Audio API. I update the scale, emissive color of the material, and rotation, of one mesh each for every frame per second.p  pI have the following three specific questionsp  ol lipIs there a better way to update the position of a large mesh in Three.js one from a geometry that has had many smaller geometries merged with it, without updating each vertex individually If not, is there a more efficient way to optimize the way I am updating these verticespli lipAre any of the other operations I am doing on my meshes updating scale, emissive color of material, or rotation, particularly costly Is there a way to optimize thempli lipAre there any ways I might not be aware of, besides trying my best to optimize for speed, to standardize the performance of my app across devices pli ol  pMy source code is here a hrefhttpsgithub.comjaclynjdancingcitiesblobmasterpublicmain.js relnofollowhttpsgithub.comjaclynjdancingcitiesblobmasterpublicmain.jsap  pAnd my site is here dancingcities.heroku.comp  pThank youp

Negative 41 pI am creating a new database using EF codefirst which contain the following classes p  precodeAddress, Contact, Account, Customer a subclass of Account, and SalesOrder.  codepre  pThe Address class is the one giving me problems at the moment, it can have no foreign key because it can be linked to any of the other five classes with more to come, and each of the other classes can have one or more navigation properties pointing back to it.p  pThe navigation properties should look as followsp  precodeContact.AddressId Contact.Address  Account.AddressId Account.Address  Customer.DeliveryAddresses  SalesOrder.InvoiceAddressId SalesOrder.InvoiceAddress  SalesOrder.DeliveryAddressId SalesOrder.DeliveryAddress codepre  pIt should be possible for these classes to share the same Address record, e.g. an Account has an Address, this can also be linked to a SalesOrder, a different Address, linked to the Customer, could be linked to another SalesOrder. All Addresses linked to Accounts and Customers should be unique, but other classes should be able to share links to these Addresses.p  pI have tried setting it up with all the possible fluent configurations I can think of, with my DbContext having a DbSet property and without ultimately I dont think it should have its own DbSet property, as the Addresses should only be accessible from the various root objects, but if thats the only way to get it to work Im happy to manage the insertsdeletes myself.p  pI tried making all the navigation properties nullable ideally SalesOrder.InvoiceAddressId should not be nullable, and also had to remove the Customer.DeliveryAddresses ManytoMany mapping at one point because that was confusing the issue. p  pI get various errors depending on how I have it set up, either Multiplicity conflicts due to nonnullable fields, or Cascade on Delete errors when I have no DbSet property and I try and let EF handle the inserts and deletes.p  pI also end up with unwanted null rows when I do have a DbSet property set. e.gp  precodeadd three Address records to the DbSet Address1, Address2, Address3, add two Accounts to the DbSet Account1 amp Account2, add multiple SalesOrders, set Account1.AddressId  1 set Account2.AddressId  2,  set SalesOrdern.InvoiceAddressId  1, set SalesOrdern.DeliveryAddressId  3 codepre  pThis will correctly create the Address records, but the related keys will only be set correctly if the various Id foreignkey properties are used, rather than the navigation property, and even if the Id properties are used the foreign keys all look correct, but orphaned records for each SalesOrder or two per order if both navigation properties are used end up in my Address table with all their fields bar Id set to NULL.p  pThe only thing I can think of that I havent tried would be to create multiple subclasses of Address and use each one with its related class e.g. SalesOrderDeliveryAddress, but that doesnt seem ideal. Id rather not do that unless I have to.p  pIs what Im looking for possible to set up in EF, or is there some other way to go about doing itp  pThanks, Davidp

Negative 41 pI have read up and searched through the forums about leaking memory and gradually increasing RAM. I tried to use the call of System.GC method every 60 seconds in my program and it seems to be working given that my RAM usage drops every call. Why is it a good idea not to use this method In every post I have read they seemed to vaguely explain why the method does not free up memory, yet my program seems to say otherwise. Some even said the method did nothing at all but suggest to the Garbage Collector clean itself up. NOTE  My leak is not from static methods I know because I removed them from my entire project and the RAM still increased. I would post my code, but it is rather large so I doubt anyone is up to reading it. p  pThanks for the help.p

Negative 41 pMy client has got an existing site with membership details, member portfolios and directories which are largely done manually in php associated with Silverstripe CMS platform which works well. Also their admin person has got an offline member data system  Microsoft Access, and they have been double adding membership details to MS Access according to the membership details on the website.p  pMy first thought was to ditch the MS Access and keep all database online, but they have been working on MS Access for years even before the site was built, so we are thinking of keeping the MS Access as well as the site database. p  pThis is the first time I am experiencing MS Access, and both database structures are set up differently. I am just wondering is it possible to synchronise MS Access and the website database Eg the MS Access member data gets automatically updated when the membership is updated online.p  pHow would I achieve it Which programming languages would be used Any secuirity issues to synchronise an offline MS Access and online website Any steps, links or learning links would be great help.

Negative 41 pI have several classes, some of which are abstract that I want the base class version of the method to call the most derived version of another method in the same class which then works its way up the chain and doing the complete job of the method. The reason why I have base and derived methods is because the different levels have different access to information. If an Order object is null I dont want to have to test for null before I try to get the information. The result is a series of cascading classes with each derived version of the method calling the base method and then building on what the base method is doing to fulfil its objective.p  precode    public abstract class EmailTemplates              ....         protected virtual string ReplaceVariablesKeyValuePairltstring, stringgt namevalue, string body                        This builds an email body             protected void BuildBody                              ifNamesValues  null                                      foreach KeyValuePairltstring, stringgt namevalue in NamesValues                                               This gives back eg order details                         string subsectionName                          Test if this value is a subsection                          If subsection not in the list, keep unchanged                         if Subsections.TryGetValuenamevalue.Key, out subsectionName                                                       This retrieves the subsection details                             this.emailBody  this.emailBody.Replacenamevalue.Value, GetSubsectionsubsectionName, namevalue.Value                                                   This is a regular variable not a subsection                         else                                                      this.emailBody  ReplaceVariablesnamevalue, this.emailBody                                                                                              protected virtual string ReplaceVariablesKeyValuePairltstring, stringgt namevalue, string body                      switchnamevalue.Key                              case url                      body  body.Replacenamevalue.Value, Url                     break                 case username                     body  body.Replacenamevalue.Value, HttpContext.Current.User.Identity.Name                     break                               return body                  ....           public abstract class CustomerEmailTemplates  EmailTemplates              ...         protected new string ReplaceVariablesKeyValuePairltstring, stringgt namevalue, string body                      body  base.ReplaceVariablesnamevalue, body              switch namevalue.Key                              case forename                      If they dont have a profile, just use the username                     if Profile  null ampamp Profile.IsAnonymous  Profile.DeliveryAddress1.FirstName  null  Profile.DeliveryAddress1.FirstName                                                body  body.Replacenamevalue.Value, Username                                           If user is changing their password, etc.                     else if Profile  null                                              body  body.Replacenamevalue.Value, Profile.DeliveryAddress1.FirstName                                           To display template to admin dont replace anything                     break                 case surname                      If they dont have a profile, just use nothing as username will already be there                     if Profile  null ampamp Profile.IsAnonymous  Profile.DeliveryAddress1.LastName  null  Profile.DeliveryAddress1.LastName                                                body  body.Replacenamevalue.Value,                                           else if Profile  null                                              body  body.Replacenamevalue.Value, Profile.DeliveryAddress1.LastName                                            To display template to admin dont replace anything                     break                          return body                  ...           public class OrderEmailTemplates  CustomerEmailTemplates              ...         protected new string ReplaceVariablesKeyValuePairltstring, stringgt namevalue, string body                      body  base.ReplaceVariablesnamevalue, body              switch namevalue.Key                                      case customerEmail                     body  body.Replacenamevalue.Value, Order.CustomerEmail                     break                 case orderID                     body  body.Replacenamevalue.Value, Order.ID.ToString                     break                 ....                      ...      codepre  pSorry for the code dump but I am unsure of how to make it much smaller.

Negative 41 pI have a UIViewController JDTHViewController with a UIView JDTHMainMenu In the  view controller are two buttons that each, once clicked, move to two other separate view controllers. In the UIView are two other buttons options and stats that, once clicked, create subviews on top of the view, minus a few pixels from each side, and therefore hide the two buttons so you can interact with the subviews. Now when I run the simulator all my buttons are in the right positions but once one of the UIViews buttons are clicked they disappear and the segue buttons ViewController switch buttons are on top of my subviews. I need these to disappear once options or stats is clicked. Is there a way to do this I hope that made sense if not ill post more info or code. Thanksp
Negative 41 pLet me explain my circumstances first, then it will make sense. Im writing an application which consists of a desktop application and some libraries which must be supported in the full framework and the strongCompact Frameworkstrong.p  pIm writing unit tests for my library that must be able to be compiled under CF 3.5.

They simply list the NuGet package install command.p  pHowever, I must use VS2008 to develop this library because later versions of VS do not support the Compact Framework v3.5 stupid Microsoft. strongVS2008 does not support NuGetstrong. Therefore, Ive created a lib folder in my projects directory to add 3rd party libraries such as these tools for unit tests. But, Im having a hard time finding the .dlls for the tools.p  pDo I have to create a separate VS201X solution just to use the NuGet package manager to grab the binaries and then copy them to the VS2008 project Thats my current solution.

This can be done using either 1 Evaluate unless there are blanks or text in the range, which gives an error or 2 worksheetfunction.product, but it doesnt like it when I look through the range and add 1.p  pIf anyone can figure out a solution for using either of these options I would be over the moon. I may also be missing something very basicp  pLonger version...p  pWhat Im trying to do Create three VBA functions that calculate 1 compound return 2 annualised compound return and 3 annualised volatility. These would be for variable ranges and for the annualised functions you can also specify whether it is days, months or years. For example, the compound return function when used would look something compoundreturnrange,number of periodsp  pThe calculations are easy using formula but I want to create functions to make it a quick process.p  pI can get all three to work through VBA using EVALUATE. p  pThey look like this,p  precodeFunction PerRetrng As range     PerRet  Worksheet.Evaluateexpsumproductln amp rng.Address amp 11 End Function  Function AnnRetrng As range, np As Double     AnnRet  EvaluateexpAverageln amp rng.Address amp 1 amp np amp 1 End Function  Function AnnVolrng As range, np As Double     AnnVol  Worksheet.Evaluatestdev.sln amp rng.Address amp 1sqrt amp np amp  End Function codepre  pThe problem is that the range selected may sometimes by the entire column, which contains blanks and potentially text. Functions like AVERAGE or STDEV.S will ignore these when you are just using them in formulas. Unfortunately, they dont do this when using Evaluate.p  pI know that instead of using Evaluate for AVERAGE, I could use codeworksheetfunction.averagecode, which would then ignore the blanks and text. But here I come across another problem in that part of the function has to look through a range of returns postiive and negative and add 1 to each before averaging. This doesnt seem to work for a range unless that range is simply one cell.p  pAn example of what I have so far for this isp  precodeFunction AnnRetrng As range, np As Double       AnnRet  expWorksheetFunction.AverageWorksheetFunction.Lnrng  1  np  1       End Function codepre  pAny ideas how I can make it add 1 to each of the cells in the range before getting the Ln and then averagingp  pMany thanks for looking Duncanp

Negative 41 pIve got myself a question regarding associations in Sails.js version 0.10rc5. Ive been building an app in which multiple models are associated to one another, and Ive arrived at a point where I need to get to nest associations somehow.p  pTheres three partsp  pFirst theres something like a blog post, thats being written by a user. In the blog post I want to show the associated users information like their username. Now, everything works fine here. Until the next step Im trying to show comments which are associated with the post.p  pThe comments are a separate Model, called Comment. Each of which also has an author user associated with it. I can easily show a list of the Comments, although when I want to display the Users information associated with the comment, I cant figure out how to populate the Comment with the users information.p  pIn my controller im trying to do something like thisp  precodePost   .findOnereq.paramid   .populateuser   .populatecomments  I want to populate this comment with .populateuser or something   .execfunctionerr, post       Handle errors amp render view etc.    codepre  pIn my Posts show action im trying to retrieve the information like this simplifiedp  precodeltulgt    lt .eachpost.comments, functioncomment  gt     ltligt       lt comment.user.name gt       lt comment.description gt     ltligt   lt  gt ltulgt codepre  pThe comment.user.name will be undefined though. If I try to just access the user property, like comment.user, itll show its ID. Which tells me its not automatically populating the users information to the comment when I associate the comment with another model. p  pAnyone any ideals to solve this properly p  pThanks in advancep  pP.S.p  pFor clarification, this is how ive basically set up the associations in different modelsp  precode User.js posts    collection post ,    hours    collection hour , comments    collection comment    Post.js user    model user , comments    collection comment,   via post    Comment.js user    model user , post    model post  codepre

Negative 41 pIm writing a utility class that should be able to parse delimited files comma, pipe, colon delimited. It reads a particular line and needs to extract the most commonly used delimiter in that line. But this doesnt seem to be working as expected. When I call the codegetHeadercode method in my main method caller class, It seems like the only delimiter thats being acknowledged is a comma from the line.

Negative 41 pIm trying to create an instruction decoder in Verilog using Xilinx. My apologies for not having the cleanest code, Im still learning Verilog. The issue I am having is that my FS result is incorrect.p  pI expect to see 00010 but instead I see 01010. As I debug, I changed the FS nonblocking assignment for ADD from 00010 to 01010 just to see what the result would be and I end up with FS being 10010. This leads me to believe that the bit[3] of FS is adding an extra 1 somehow.

Negative 41 pIm dealing with a large traffic, between hundreds and thousands HTTP requests per second.p  pI need to analyze my access.log with a precision of ONE SECOND over some time, e.g. 60 minutes. In other words Id like to produce a report with 3600 bars, showing total number of requests for each second, ideally each bar should be a stack of coloured http codes 2xx, 4xx, 5xx.p  pIs there a tool that can produce a report like this I dont want to track traffic live or stuff like that, just analyze a part of the access.log offline with 1 sec precision.p  pI need to detect if there are sudden spikes where the traffic suddenly goes up from 500 to e.g. 5000 requests per second flooding the fastcgi app socket and causing timeouts. Access.log is ridiculously big with that traffic and trying to read anything from it is a pain.p

Negative 41 pIf I call task.wait inside a thread that is managed by the thread pool, is that thread handed back to the thread pool so that it can be reused elsewhere while waiting or is it kept idle therefore not reused until the task completes p  pI would suspect the second one as it would be the behaviour for any thread that is not managed by the thread pool.p
Negative 41 pSo this is a rather large, and potentially awkward, problem my manager has tasked me with. We have around 1800 lists each list contains a dozen columns, with three columns being, building, location, and manager. My manager is requesting the ability to do a search based off of building, location, and manager, and have all lists with these matching values be concatenated into a single list. p  pIm not sure where to even begin searching for a solution to this problem. Im familiar with jquery, so if that helps. If anyone has a suggestion on how to achieve this, if its even possible, youll have my thanks p

Negative 41 pI have a phpmyadmin table with auto increment id. I display this entries 12 in each page, so 112 are in the first page 1324 to the second page and so on. Each entry has a specific position so 1 is top left 4 is top right 9 is bot left and 12 is bot right. If one entry is deleted, say entry with id3 from the database, when displayed the entry position is left empty, because when it tries to get the information with databse id3 it gets nothing. Is there a way when the row is deleted from the databse, to make everything after that entry in the database with 1 id so if i delete entry 3, entry 4 becomes the new entry  3, entry 5 becomes the new entry 4 and so on. Is there a function in phpmyadmin that does this or  do i have to make my own, or is there a trick I can implement.p

Negative 41 pIn an MVC application I have a number of rtf files which are used as templates. The app loads them, fills the blanks and outputs the result as codeFileContentResultcode.

First, those files are integral part of the project and moving them outside of the project would mess are subversion system.

We dont really need the various versions to share those files, its fine if each version of the app has a copy of them.p

Negative 41 pIn my code I have an object that contains a series of pixel coordinates. Performance of this object is critical because its being used in a 60fps game where the output cannot always be cached. p  pAfter experimentation and benchmarking, a 3D array proved to be the fastest way of implementing it when using untyped arraysp  precodevar PixelCollection  function      this.pixels  []   PixelCollection.prototype       add functionx, y          var pixels  this.pixels         if pixels[y]              pixels[y].pushx          else              pixels[y]  [x]              ,     each functioncallback          var pixels  this.pixels         for var y  0, m  pixels.length y lt m y              var row  pixels[y]             if row                  for var i  0, mm  row.length i lt mm i                      callbackrow[i], y                                              codepre  pIn some situations, the object is not fast enough, so I tried a codeUint8Arraycode implementation, using a 2D array p  precodevar WIDTH  255 var HEIGHT  160  PixelCollection  function      this.pixels  new Uint8ArrayWIDTH  HEIGHT   PixelCollection.prototype       add functionx, y          this.pixels[WIDTH  y  x]  1     ,     each functioncallback          var pixels  this.pixels         for var i  0, m  pixels.length i lt m i              if pixels[i]                  callbacki  WIDTH, Math.floori  WIDTH                             codepre  pThis is slower. I thought it would be faster because writing to  and reading from codeUint8arraycodes is faster, but since Im creating a huge object for every PixelCollection object, retrieving pixels is way slower because it takes longer to iterate over all pixels. Note I also tried the implementation above with an untyped array it is a emlotem slowerp  pA PixelCollection typically does not have all pixels set. However, the bounding box may span the entire canvas so I do need to create the array using a buffer this big.p  pThere may be a way around that though. I can create one big shared buffer and use a byte offset for every PixelCollection. So when PixelCollection codeP1code would take up 100 bytes, then PixelCollection codeP2code would start at byte offset 100. This uses memory more efficiently, but I would need to keep track of the range of bytes every PixelCollection uses is this what C calls pointers. p  pAnnoying part when codeP1codes bounding box expands, I need to shift codeP2code to make space for codeP1code. And I would need to set a safe buffer size for the shared buffer, so I need to make a safe guesstimation of how much memory it needs.p  pImplementing this is possible, but it would require lots of time, trial and error. p  pSo before start on this does it seem a good way to do it Are there better or simpler ways to do this Do you know any example implementations I could learn fromp  pEdit a hrefhttpjsperf.comaddinganditeratingthroughpixelcoordinates relnofollowstrongI added a jsperf in case you want to try your hand at an optimization.strongabr Please add to this jsperf if you have a brilliant idea for an optimization.p

Negative 41 pI had some time and thought about an eventbased programming language. By that I mean a language where every variable is updated, when you change a dependent variable. For example consider the following pseudocode for a terminalapplicationp  precodeint a  5 int b  a  5   event which is called every 5 seconds every 5 seconds gt        update a by adding 5      a ltlt a  5    event which is called when the user presses enter on enter gt      printlnb    b  codepre  pPressing enter will print the value of strongbstrong. But the result will be strong10strong only for the first five seconds, because after that strongastrong will be updated to strong10strong and for the next five seconds strongbstrong will equal strong15strong, because strongbstrong depends on strongastrong.p  pThis concept will bring certain problems, of course, but it also offers some benefits. Imagine for example a GUIapplication which is normally programmed with events, which shows two inputboxes and the result of adding the two numbersp  precode       5              6           11       codepre  pIt could be programmed in the following wayp  precode two inputboxes and a label Textbox tb1  new TextBox  format  numeric, value  5  Label lbl1plus  new Label  value    Textbox tb2  new TextBox  format  numeric, value  6    and the result Label lbl1plus  new Label  value     tb1.value  tb2.value  codepre  pThats it. It is a little bit like excel, but with real programming. Is there a programming language like this Or something similarp

Negative 41 pI have a routine that is meant to load and parse data from a file. There is a possibility that the data from the same file might need to be retrieved from two places at once, i.e. during a background caching process and from a user request.p  pSpecifically I am using C11 thread and mutex libraries. We compile with Visual C 11 aka 2012, so are limited by whatever it lacks.p  pMy naive implementation went something like thisp  precodemapltwstring,weakptrltDataStructgtgt datacache mutex datacachemutex  sharedptrltDataStructgt ParseDataFilewstring filepath      auto dataptr  makesharedltDataStructgt       Parses and processes the data, may take a while       return dataptr   sharedptrltDataStructgt CreateStructFromDatawstring filepath      lockguardltmutexgt lockdatacachemutex      auto cacheiter  datacache.findfilepath     if cacheiter  enddatacache          auto dataptr  cacheitergtsecond.lock         if dataptr             return dataptr          reference died, remove it         datacache.erasecacheiter           auto dataptr  ParseDataFilefilepath      if dataptr         datacache.emplacemakepairfilepath, dataptr      return dataptr  codepre  pMy goals were twofoldp  ul liAllow multiple threads to load separate files concurrentlyli liEnsure that a file is only processed onceli ul  pThe problem with my current approach is that it doesnt allow concurrent parsing of multiple files at all. If I understand what will happen correctly, theyre each going to hit the lock and end up processing linearly, one thread at a time. It may change from run to run the order which the threads pass through the lock first, but the end result is the same.p  pOne solution Ive considered was to create a second mapp  precodemapltwstring,mutexgt dataparsingmutex  sharedptrltDataStructgt ParseDataFilewstring filepath      lockguardltmutexgt lockdataparsingmutex[filepath]      etc.      dataparsingmutex.erasefilepath  codepre  pBut now I have to be concerned with how codedataparsingmutexcode is being updated.

Negative 41 pI have been looking around on forums and i havent been able to find anything specific enough for what i am having trouble with. I am trying to make a function for collision detection in a 2D platformer, and at first i could make it work with explicitly naming every vertex and it where the player would then move to upon collision, but that was not efficient at all and ended up with alot of retyping things. It would work at first but over time it would become more of a hassle than it is worth. I am trying to make a collision detection function that will be able to tell me which side the player is colliding on and that will be able to move the character to the proper position. I am using allegro 5 and c and this is my function thus farp  precodebool Collisionint x1,int y1,int h1,int w1,int x2,int y2,int h2,int w2      ifx1 lt x2  w2 ampamp        x2 lt x1  w1 ampamp        y1 lt y2  h2 ampamp        y2 lt y1  h1        return 1      return 0  codepre  phow could i make it so that upon collision my object will stop and not continue through the object but also know that it has landed on top of something, or hit the side or bottom of it because those would each be different reactions.p

Negative 41 pI have a homework problem that requires me to calculate the chi squared statistic from scratch in R. The first part of the problem requires that a data set be randomly generated from U[0,1] and then a list of successive triples be formed. The third part of the question states that we need to count the number of triples that fall in each of the 1000 cubes of side 0.1 that cover the unit cube. I am really confused about this third part of the question. How do we create a count for the number of triples falling  in each of the 1000  cubes  of a given side  length  Graphically I  understand what this should be like, but  have no idea  how to program it. Any help or suggestion on this will be greatly appreciated Thank you in advance,p

Negative 41 pI have a little program I wrote that uses codestdasynccode for parallelism, and it is crashing on me. Im pretty sure that there are much better ways to do this, but for now I just want to know what is happening here. Im not going to post the exact code since I do not think it really makes a difference. It basically looks something like thisp  precodewhile1      stdvectorltThingsgt things256      auto updatethethings  [amp]int start, int end  some code       auto handle1  stdasyncstdlaunchasync, updatethethings, 0, things.size  4     auto handle2  stdasyncstdlaunchasync, updatethethings, things.size  4, things.size  4  2     auto handle3  stdasyncstdlaunchasync, updatethethings, things.size  4  2, things.size  4  3     updatethethingsthings.size  4  3, things.size      handle1.get     handle2.get     handle3.get  codepre  pThis loop runs several thousand times per second and after a random amount of time 5 seconds  1 minute it crashes. If I look in task manager I see that the thread count for this program is rapidly fluctuating, which makes me think that codestdasynccode is launching new threads with each call. I would have thought it would work with a thread pool or something. In any case, is this crashing because I am doing something wrongp  pUsing GDB I get the followingp  precodeProgram received signal SIGSEGV, Segmentation fault.

Negative 41 pI am trying to use Python to geocode a list of addresses I have stored in a table in PostGIS. I would like to set things up so that every time the table is updated, and a new address is added, it would automatically be geocoded and then plotted on a map.

However, plpythonu is acting really weird I might ask about that here later, but for now I am looking for alternative solutions rather than figuring out plpythonu .p  pI cant think of another way to set things up so an entry is geocoded as soon as it is entered into the database Can someone give me some ideas on where to start lookingp

The code uses codeT.selfcode to create an instance of the class of codeTcode. Although codeTcode could be inferred to codeFoocode or codeBarcode in the call to codefcode in both cases, I would expect it to be inferred to the same thing in both cases, since inference of the type argument should only on the signature and calling code, and the signature and calling code are identical in both cases.p  pcodeT.selfcode should already be of type codeT.Typecode, so casting it should be a noop in fact, the compiler shouldnt even allow the cast, since it should always be true. Yet by performing this cast, I seem to be changing the class that I am calling the initializer on. Casting an object should not alter the value of the object if it succeeds, so this is really weird.p

Negative 41 pI am a JavaAndroid developer. Working on a custom Android browser project based on Chromium. p  pMy task is to add client certificate support to the browser.p  pI have a map of hosts with corresponding keystorepassword where client certificate is stored. So the idea is whenever user opens a url corresponding to one of the hosts from the map, a corresponding keystore should be used to pass a certificate to an SSL connection.p  pSince I dont find any place in the current Java code where I could do this I would expect some callback with url as a parameter where I could return a keystore or smth like that, I think I need to modify Chromium CC sources, using JNI to create a Java callback class.

Negative 41 pOkay, so Ive seen a couple of different approaches for redirecting a user when, for example, they are not logged in, or are not allowed to view a page, and decide to redirect.p  pIll set the scene ... Lets say, when a user has provided a correct username and password, the session variable codeSESSION[loggedin]code is created. Now, when this user goes to codeloggedinusersonly.phpcode, he can happily see the page. But, along comes Danger Jim, who hasnt logged in, and goes to codeloggedinusersonly.phpcode and gets redirected back to the home page Maybe with a warningp  pSo. heres the 2 main approaches I have seen, and was wondering if either of them have security implications, or could somehow allow Danger Jim to see the codeloggedinusersonly.phpcode pagep  pstrongExample 1strongp  precodeifsessionstatusPHPSESSIONNONE      sessionstart  ifissetSESSION[loggedin]      show content  else      headerLocation home.php     exit  codepre  pstrongExample 2strongp  precodeifsessionstatusPHPSESSIONNONE      sessionstart  ifissetSESSION[loggedin]      headerLocation home.php     exit  show content codepre  pPersonally, I have always gone with the first approach.

Negative 41 pas the title says i want to present here mine approach to map and collision generating in SDL.  Currently the map is generated by loading an HD picture of a map from Zelda. Then i made a simple map engine editor which helps me position collision boxes wherever i want the collision box size is random , along with the position  generated by simple mouse click and drag. But working on the project i soon realized that i can not implement a proper AI pathfinding algorithm to make an Enemy reach the Player avoiding the collision areas. Ive been reading about pathfinding algorithms but as far as i understand those methods require constant sized and positioned collision boxes for example 8x8 or 16x16 etc.p  pMy Questions are the following 1. Is it good to progress further with this method, or should i create the map out of tilesTiled map editor. But i do not know how does Collision detection work in that particular software. I tried making objectlayer and put some collision boxed in there but, the boxes position and size is not consistent with the map grid. Meaning that i can pop a box in the middle of a 8x8 tile box. 2. If i keep my method and approach is there a way to make a working AI path finder. 3. Ive always wondered how were half  collidable tile boxes made collision over the slopediagonal of the tile not the outer bounds 4.Also  I would like some good soul to explain me how does tiled maps work. Why should i not use an HD picture instead of such mapbesides performance issues I do not seem to grasp them AT ALL. Also how can i generate Grid collision boxes over a picture map background p  pPS I would not apply any code examples for now , since my Question is more related with the logic behind the game rather than the actual programming part.p  pPS2 In Advance , I would like you to excuse me if my English is causing you headaches. p

I used the keytool to check the fingerprint certificated SHA1 and its the same both in the APK file and the google play console.br  Might be relevant to note that Im using the most up to date plugin and it generates the AndroidManifest.XML by itself so there isnt much place to make mistakes there, and by the logs request I can see that its actually asking for the correct package..p  pI honestly have no idea what else I can do to fix this, Ive literally tried EVERYTHING.

FinalClass should indeed contain 2 A. My problem is, that the creation of E or F would require, that B, C and D inherit A virtually.. however, if A is a virtual base class, then the compiler would only create one A object in FinalClass instead of two different ones.p  pSo, I think many of you would recommend composition instead of inheritance here. However, composition modells a has arelationship here and not an is arelationship. In explaination, I would like FinalClass to truly behave like an E or F, including being able to convert it to those classes.p

Negative 41 pI would like to use Fluent NHibernate automappings to create the mappings for my project, but then I would like override some of these mappings by another mechanism. That mechanism would be based on custom attributes on the model classes and some reflection login to inspect these attributes and perform the necessary overrides.p  pThe overrides are made by calling the codeOverrideltTgtActionltAutoMappingltTgtgt populateMapcode method in the AutoPersistenceModel class FluentNHibernate.Automapping.AutoPersistenceModel.p  pIm experimenting with just one attribute type at the moment. My idea is that if I get this to work, I will create more attributes and refine them. The one attribute I have at the moment is called MapIdAsAssignedAttribute and its supposed to perform the same mapping as thisp  precodemapping.Idx gt x.Id.GeneratedBy.Assigned codepre  pHowever, my approach is not working as I would expect. The code runs OK, and when the override method is called, Im able to verify by debugging that it is making the same changes in the inlineOverrides collection in AutoPersistenceModel class as are made when code.UseOverridesFromAssemblyOfltTgtcode is processed and it finds some classes implementing codeIAutoMappingOverrideltTgtcode. p  pThe problem is that when the configuration is built into an ISessionFactory object by calling the BuildSessionFactory method, the overrides I have made programmatically by calling the Override method are not included in the configuration. The configuration is as if the override calls had not been made at all.p  pSo, the overrides using the codeIAutoMappingOverrideltTgtcode classes work, but the overrides made by calling the codeOverrideltTgtActionltAutoMappingltTgtgt populateMapcode method dont work. And to be able to use the reflection stuff with custom attributes, I would need to get the Override method to work also.p  pAm I doing something wrong here, or is this behaviour the result of some logic in Fluent NHibernate Possibly a bug I believe this kind of programmatic overrides might be hugely useful for many other projects, toop  pHere is the code for the relevant class in my projectp  precodepublic class SessionFactoryCreator      private readonly string connectionStringName      public SessionFactoryCreatorstring connectionStringName  null              connectionStringName  connectionStringName           public virtual ISessionFactory CreateSessionFactoryltTgtstring connectionString  null              connectionString  connectionString  GetConnectionStringconnectionStringName         ISessionFactory sessionFactory  ConfigureltTgtconnectionString.BuildSessionFactory         return sessionFactory           public virtual FluentConfiguration ConfigureltTgtstring connectionString  null              connectionString  connectionString  GetConnectionStringconnectionStringName          AutoPersistenceModel autoMappings  CreateAutoMappingsltTgt          FluentConfiguration configuration  Fluently.Configure             .DatabaseGetPersistenceConfigurerconnectionString             .Mappingsm gt CreateFluentMappingsm             .Mappingsm gt m.AutoMappings.AddautoMappings             .ExposeConfigurationc gt                              c.SetPropertyEnvironment.TransactionStrategy, NHibernate.Transaction.AdoNetTransactionFactory                 c.SetPropertyshowsql, false                       return configuration           protected virtual IPersistenceConfigurer GetPersistenceConfigurerstring connectionString              IPersistenceConfigurer persistenceConfigurer  MsSqlConfiguration.MsSql2012.ConnectionStringconnectionString         return persistenceConfigurer           protected virtual FluentMappingsContainer CreateFluentMappingsMappingConfiguration mappingConfiguration              FluentMappingsContainer fluentMappingsContainer  mappingConfiguration.FluentMappings.AddFromAssemblyOfltSessionFactoryCreatorgt         return fluentMappingsContainer           protected virtual AutoPersistenceModel CreateAutoMappingsltTgt              AutoPersistenceModel autoPersistenceModel  AutoMap.AssemblyOfltTgtnew DefaultAutomappingConfiguration             .Conventions.Addnew ForeignKeyNameConvention             .Conventions.Addnew ReferenceNameConvention             .Conventions.Addnew ForeignKeyConstraintNameConvention             .Conventions.Addnew ManyToManyConvention             .Conventions.Addnew CascadeAllConvention             .UseOverridesFromAssemblyOfltTgt          foreach Type type in Assembly.GetAssemblytypeofT.GetTypes                      if type.GetCustomAttributestypeofMapIdAsAssignedAttribute, false.Length gt 0                              MapIdAsAssignedOverrideForTypetype, autoPersistenceModel                                return autoPersistenceModel           private void MapIdAsAssignedOverrideForTypeType type, AutoPersistenceModel autoPersistenceModel              MethodInfo method  GetType.GetMethodMapIdAsAssigned, BindingFlags.Instance  BindingFlags.NonPublic         MethodInfo genericMethodInfo  method.MakeGenericMethodtype         genericMethodInfo.Invokethis, new[]  autoPersistenceModel            private void MapIdAsAssignedltTgtAutoPersistenceModel autoPersistenceModel              autoPersistenceModel.OverrideltTgtmap gt map.Id.GeneratedBy.Assigned           protected virtual string GetConnectionStringstring connectionStringName              if string.IsNullOrEmptyconnectionStringName                      throw new ConfigurationErrorsExceptionConnection string name is not defined.

Negative 41 pI tried using PHP to run 7zip to recursively extract all the zip files that a user had put inside other zip files and then delete the original zip.p  pThe code I used worked except for a larger file about 7gigs that had some unusual file types like hdr and cab files for example where it did not fully extract the files, made duplicates of some of the ones it did, and then did not delete the original zip. The only thing I saw out of the ordinary about it was that the command prompt I ran the php file from said Incomplete Extraction. Im not sure why the extraction and deletion worked for every file but this one.p  pAny help in understanding this would be greatly appreciated  Thank you for your timep  pHere is the code snippetp  precodecmd2  FOR R zipfiledirectory I IN .zip DO 7z x I aou odpI ampamp del fI execcmd2, out2, ret2 codepre  pstrongEDITstrongp  pAlso it returned a 0 exit code.

Negative 41 pSo im trying to build a link page with 2 divs.  Both covering 50 of the screen. I would like to keep this 100 CSS, because I dont want to use javascript and I am not familiair with Jquery. p  pMy problem seems to be a bug, according to lots of stackoverflow posts. Yet none of them have a working solution for me..  The css works just like I planned in every browser, except for Chrome and Safari. p  pHere is an example of my HTMLp  precodeltdiv idleftgt   ltdiv idleftImagegt      the background image   ltdivgt   ltdiv idoverlayLeftgt      a logo that goes on top of the image when not hovering over it   ltdivgt ltdivgt ltdiv idrightgt   ltdiv idrightImagegt      the background image   ltdivgt   ltdiv idoverlayRightgt      a logo that goes on top of the image when not hovering over it   ltdivgt ltdivgt codepre  pAnd my CSS is the same on both sides except for some things like codeleft0code and suchp  precodeleft       Set rules to fill background      minheight 100     minwidth 50       Set up proportionate scaling      width 50     height auto      position fixed     top 0     left 0       background 0C4270     backgroundsizecover     leftImage          opacity0.15     filter alphaopacity15  For IE8 and earlier      background rgba0, 0, 0, 0.15         webkittransition opacity 2.00s ease     moztransition opacity 2.00s ease             transition opacity 2.00s ease      position relative          overflow hidden      leftImagehover      opacity1.00     filter alphaopacity100  For IE8 and earlier      background rgba0, 0, 0, 1.0    leftImagehover  overlayLeft     visibility hidden   codepre  pSo when I hover over my left image the image dissapears for a few seconds about 10 seconds and then reloads. The only thing I see is a blue background till the image reloads. p  pThe strange thing is that this does not happen on my right image. That image is working just as expected.p  pIve tried a few thing like suggested on other posts, likep  pa hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions12980153imagemovesonhoverchromeopacityissuewebkitbackfacevisibility hiddenap  pa hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions15152470chromerenderingissuefixedpositionanchorwithulinbody1520388015203880webkittransform translateZ0ap  pa hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions2946748iphonewebkitcssanimationscauseflickerwebkitperspective 1000ap  pa hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions12980153imagemovesonhoverchromeopacityissuetransform translate3d0px,0px,0pxap  pa hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions20268962fixedattachmentbackgroundimageflickerdisappearinchromewhencoupledwithpostition statica  had the best result with this one, but still useless, because the image wont be streched and would be stuck in the left cornerp  pAnd so on. Not even one worked  What do I want to achieve    I want the image to be on the background of the div im not hovering over so it is vaguely visible trough the opacity   The image should be fully visible no opacity when the div is hovered. p  pBoth of the functionalities are working in all browsers except Chrome and Safari. p  pAny solutionsp  pas requested a hrefhttpsjsfiddle.netmxbjja29 relnofollowjsfiddlea open this with Chrome or Safari for the bugp
Negative 41 pIs it possible to enable zoompinch to enlarge images with onsen UI  or maybe open a graphic in a new view to zoomin somehowp  pIm aware Im in a technical forum and though my question is very technical to me this might not be the appropriate place to go. but I dont know where else to turn. Im working with a technical partner and he created a hybrid app. It is a learning app that needs to convey complex information and therefore it is important to display infographics that the user needs to zoomin to be able to read the containing information. My partner tells me that pinch and zoom is not possible for hybrid apps which I find hard to believe since after extensive research I coulnt find this explicit restriction anywhere and there would be no solution to my problem. So now Im trying now myself to find a solution. p  pThank you for your patiencep
Negative 41 pI am getting this issue from last few days. Rubymine keeps showing scanning project directories in the footer of the window for hours. Sometimes for day. This brings the issue that I am not able to click on any method and land on it. Moreover Rubymine has started to hang very frequently sometimes irrecoverably so that I have to quit and restart it. Once it even did not restart so I have to restart the computer.p  pI have added many projects around 10. Is it the root cause or something else. But I am not able to remove these projects so as to ease the problem. p  pI am using rubymine 7.0 Thanks a lot in advancep

Negative 41 pLets say I have a web application whose core is to process student data. There are a number of ways to interface with this data, but lets limit it to these twop  ul liStudents by classli liStudents by gradeli ul  pThrough the interface, I can make a single AJAX call to get these students. The SQL statements will differ by interface, but I expect to get a list of students regardless. From there, I want to have multiple AJAX calls made in parallel, one for each student. Specific processing occurs here. This processing is completely independent of the interfacethe only requirement is that the input is a student. The processing done is generation of a PDF student report. p  pHeres what I have donep  ul liMultiple interfaces making a single AJAX call, both to the same PHP file.li liThe PHP file goes through POST and determines which SQL statement to run. Before asking, yes its prepared and no I dont use POST directly in the query.li liI return an array of students using codejsonencodecode.li liI iterate over the array of students to generate studentspecific documents in parallel by using multiple AJAX calls.li ul  pThis is fine and dandy and everything is working as intended. The problem is that Im strongopening multiple connections to the databasestrong once for the initial obtaining of student data, and then strongone for every studentstrong. This is horribly inefficient I had a thought about using a hrefhttpphp.netmanualenfunction.jsonencode.php relnofollowcodejsonencodecodea to encode the connection resource, but the documentation very clearly states that this is strongnot possible because resources cannot be encoded for JSONstrong. While ultimately using something like threads would enable me to parallel process the student data without having to return from the initial PHP script, strongthe server is not configured for pthreadsstrong.p  pGiven this scenario, how does one maintain a single persistent connection resource across multiple parallel AJAX calls Is it even possiblep
Negative 41 pI am taking data from an SQLite database used by on Android app and modifying massaging it before inserting it into another SQLite database for a different Android app to use. Im doing the conversion via a Ruby script. For some data, I need to generate new UUIDs which are stored in a text string in the new database. Initially, I had generated and inserted them as followsp  pre classlangrb prettyprintoverridecodenewDB.execute INSERT INTO mytable uid, anotherfield                  VALUES , ,                SecureRandom.hex16.tos, Other data codepre  pHowever, upon trying to pull data back out, the Android app would croak with an SQLiteException, Unable to convert BLOB to string when executing the cursors codegetStringcode method.p  pGoing back to the drawing board, I tried instead generating and inserting these new UUIDs as followsp  pre classlangrb prettyprintoverridecodenewDB.execute INSERT INTO mytable uid, anotherfield                  VALUES , ,                SecureRandom.uuid.tr, , Other data codepre  pThis produces a record that, as far as I can tell, is completely indiscernible from the result of the first or from data generated by the second app, but this second method works properly when the app accesses it.p  pWhat is the difference between these two methods, and in the future, how can I discern the difference in looking at the data in SQLitep

First, data indexed by geohash will have all points for a   given rectangular area in contiguous slices the number of slices   depends on the precision required and the presence of geohash fault   lines. This is especially useful in database systems where queries   on a single index are much easier or faster than multipleindex   queries. Second, this index structure can be used for a   quickanddirty proximity search  the closest points are often among   the closest geohashes.p blockquote  pSo for e.g. to find neighbors of sj8101b085, I just had planned to search hashes by doingp  precodeSELECT  FROM Users WHERE Geohash LIKE sj8101b085 codepre  pAnd then by firing same query by reducing the hash length one by one i.e. sj8101b08, sj8101b0 and so on till I get desired number of neighbors.

The library has a function called codeGEOHASHgetadjacentcode which gives us neighboring hashes of given hash. A geohash string represents a rectangle area on earth. And this function returns geohashes representing neighboring rectangles. It means I got to run this function in recursion neighbors and then neighbors of neighbors and so on till I get desired number of neighbors.  p  pNow I am really confused how shall I write my search algorithm Using first approach or using secondp

Although that serves the purpose, I really want to know where in libc source codes, the actual implementation comes into play.p  pThe following two places are my major suspects Note that the emfcntrl.hem has just the declarationsp  ul liGLIBCDIRioopen.cli liGLIBCDIRportssysdepsunixsysvlinuxgenericopen.cli ul  pSample Driverp  precodeinclude ltstdio.hgt include ltstdlib.hgt include ltfcntl.hgt  int mainint argc, char argv[]      int fd      if fd  opensample.c, ORDONLY  1          fprintfstderr, file not foundn         exit1           return 0  codepre  pConcerned snippetp  precodemain   401dd1       bf 44 90 48 00          mov    0x489044,edi   401dd6       b8 00 00 00 00          mov    0x0,eax   401ddb       e8 10 03 03 00          callq  4320f0 ltlibcopengt  ...... ......   libcopen   4320f0       83 3d 69 8e 28 00 00    cmpl   0x0,0x288e69rip           4320f7       75 14                   jne    43210d ltopennocancel0x14gt  opennocancel   4320f9       b8 02 00 00 00          mov    0x2,eax   4320fe       0f 05                   syscall  codepre  pFor simplicity, I had prepared all the libc sources executable  strongstaticallystrong. Also was careful enough to make GCC rightly pick the custom libc.a. I tried adding a puts statement but the mentioned two source codes are NOT getting invoked at all. Taking a look at the assembly of executable [shown above], the emsysopenem call 0x2 in emopennocancelem has been somehow placed in the executable. p  pSo my question is the following p  ul liFrom where exactly in libc, the emopenemrelated code logic magically comeli liHow is the linker able to successfully hook the open function when there is no function explicitly named open in libc source tree  li ul

I first worked on static image of square in order to get a basic understanding.

From what Ive read and thought about, I think the renderer being created with coderenderer  SDLCreateSoftwareRenderersurfacecode is just a renderer local to the initdisplay function and not being passed to the main function codeSDLSetRenderDrawColorcodeis then trying to work with a renderer that is nonexistent but I may be wrong. I tried researching and attempting various fixes but I either end up creating a coderenderercode argument codeSDLSetRenderDrawColorcode requires coderenderercode or I end up entirely dereferencing the pointer and making it just coderenderercode.How can I properly create the renderer in a function outside of main Is this even the problem relevent to my segfaultp

Negative 41 pI have a website that uses an infinite scrolling system to load all my posts. All is well except for in Chrome and sometimes Firefox when a user clicks a post, and then clicks the back button, the page is completely reloaded from the top and doesnt bother to scroll down to the users last position. Ive looked into a few solutions one being to implement a code.pushStatecode system for updating the url, but want to save that as a last resort.p  pIve noticed that websites like  a hrefhttpimgur.com relnofollowhttpimgur.coma and a hrefhttpbuzzfeed.com relnofollowhttpbuzzfeed.coma both implement an infinite scrolling system, but when the user clicks a post then clicks the back button itll return them to their last position without updating the url with the code.pushStatecode. How do they do it Thanks, Julianp

Negative 41 pIm trying to get a starting point on where to begin understanding what could cause a socket stall and would appreciate any insights any of you might have.p  pSo, server is a modern dual socket xeon 2 x 6 core  3.5 ghz running windows 2012. In a single process, there are 6 blocking tcp sockets with default options, each of which are running on their own threads not numacore specified. 5 of them are connected to the same remote server and receiving very heavy loads hundreds of thousands of small 75 byte msgs per second. The last socket is connected to a different server with a very light sendreceive load for  administrative messaging.p  pThe problem I ran into was a 5 second stall in the admin messaging socket. Multiple send calls to the socket returned successfully, however nothing was received from the remote server should receive a protocol ack within milliseconds or received BY the remote admin server for 5 seconds. It was as if that socket just turned off for a bit. After the 5 seconds stall passed, all of the acks came in a burst, and afterwards everything continued normally. During this, the other sockets were receiving much higher numbers of messages than normal, however there was no indication of any interruption or stall as the data logs displayed nothing unusual light logging, maybe 500 msgssec.p  pFrom what I understand, the socket send call does not ensure that data has gone out on the wire, just that a transfer to the tcp stack was successful. So, Im trying to understand the different scenarios that could have taken place that would cause a 5 second stall on the admin socket. Is it possible that due to the large amount of data being received the tcp stack was essentially overwhelmed and prioritized those sockets that were being most heavily utilized What other situations could have potentially caused thisp  pThank youp

Negative 41 pI have a 8 bit value that I want to store in an existing 32 bit value, while only updating the data on 8 bits and keeping the other 24 bits as they were before. p  pFor example I might want to store 0x01 0x00000001 into the existing value 0x01000100 and I want the result to be 0x01000101.p  pMy first thought was to OR in 0xFFFFFF00 to the 8 bit value I want to store to make it 0xFFFFFFXX. Then I was gonna AND that to the 32 bit value, but I realized that it wont work if the 32 bit value has 00 as the last byte and I want to store 01. Then I thought I would just use my original 8 bit value and OR it directly into the 32 bit value, but that wont work if the last byte in the 32 bit value is 01 and I want to store 00.p  pI realize that this might be a bit hard to read but basically what I want to do is to merge a 32 bit value of 0xXXXXXXXX and a 8 bit value of 0xYY 0x000000YY to become 0xXXXXXXYYp
