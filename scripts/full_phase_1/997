Positive 997 pI have a simple two column excel data sheet, in the left column I have something like 2010Jan...2015Mar in the form yyyymmm and in the right column I have random numbers like 185, 201 etc corresponding to these dates. When I import this data to Matlab I get the left column as the type cell and the right column as double. Which is what I would expect. But when I go to plot them using plot function, it says invalid first data argument which is the left column. I assume it is because I cant plot cells with doubles What do I do to plot these against each other I would of though it would be simple I just want those dates on the xaxis, should I convert them to a strings how so Thanks in advanced.p

Positive 997 pI am using carets train function in R to produce a model using GBM. I have used repeated crossvalidation with 5 repititions meaning there will be 50 samples. I want to ask if there is a way to plot the results in a different way such that the plot shows the boosting iterations on the xaxis and auc on the yaxis and inside it shows the results obtained from the best parameter selection but a separate line for training folds and test folds. This can be produced when you use gbm function from the gbm package and use gbm.perf along with sampling technique to plot the training and validation curve for deviance.p  pIs it possible to do the same with carets train function somehowp  pThanks.p

Positive 997 pGiven a function codeft, vargscode of a know variable, but that depends on a set of parameters codea1, a2, a3,...code, how can I deduce any relation between the parameters effect on the functionp  pFor instance, the function might increase with increasing values for codea1code, and decrease with increasing values of codea2code. But if both are changed by the same factor, the function is unaffected. This means that the function really only depends on a factor codeb  a1a2code. p  pI want to be able to find such relations between parameters for a given function. To simplify and reduce the possibilities I only want to find dimensionless combinations. That  is, assuming all parameters have the same unit, only combinations giving a unitless result are wanted. E.g. the combination codea1a2a3code is something to find, but codea1a2code is not.p  pIs there some way I can implement such a search Im thinking that generating different plots and eyeballing any linear graphs may be a way to do it, but how should I go about choosing what to vary and so forth I plan to implement this in Python, but anything else is just as fine. p

Negative 997 pI need to sort a DataGridView with Natural Sorting Like in Explorer so that numbers and text in the same column are sorted naturally, and not alphabetically so that place 3 comes before place 20, etc.. I have a DataGridView, where I have set a DataView as DataSource. The DataView contains a DataTable which is created with some values from a database. The column types are string. I have an IComparer, which does what it should, but I cant figure out how to use it, cause I cant find out how to do the sorting. The DataGridView.SortCompare event, which would be emperfectem, doesnt work since it is databound. The DataView.Sort, only accept strings with column names and sort orders.p  pVery annoying. Tried to read related issues here on StackOverflow, and searched google lots and lots, but I cant really find much about this. Only stuff I really find is using that Sortstring method of the dataview, which wont work, since it sorts alphabetically.p  pDoes anyone know how to do this without too much trouble It got to be others than me struggeling with this I really dont want to reimplement the whole datagridview or dataview classes, just to get custom sorting...p  pstrongUpdatestrong In case someone were wondering, Im still looking for a good answer to this problem. Although in the mean time, I ended up creating my own simple table class, and then feed that into a datagridview manually. Overriding the SortCompare method. Bit annoying, but wasnt too hard, since I only need to show values no editing or anything and therefore could convert everything to strings. p

Negative 997 pI have a problem about structures of the complex applications .Because my knowledge background does not come from education , i have had always problem about applications layers , design patterns and programing structures.First of all , I can do whatever I want with php , because I know common functions and I have experience with php. But I want to create bigger and more complicated applications than i did before ,so I always ask questions myself while I am writing code . Is this best place to do this , is this the best way to do this , do people use this way to do the same thing. To answer these questions correctly, I created my own small mvc php framework which really looks like Zend Framework. I did this because I want to clarify all parts of the application . I know that there are lots of design crimes in my framework and all my applications . And I think that the main problem is the border between Controller and Model . I asked lots of questions about this in SO ,but still it is not clear for me . Therefore , I will explain what I know and what I do , and please show my mistakes ,and correct them , or just explain some information about design patterns ,or just show my problem so I can make research about it , because I do not even know my problem , but I know that what I do is not the best way , so I can improve myself . p  pWhat i know p  ol liI know active record pattern . For example , we have user class , we use same class to save data to database , and we use same class as a object . So object is active we can create one then if we change it we can save it with same class  user  new userOguz usersaveli liI know factory pattern . We have to classes for one object UserFactory and User. We use userfactory class to acces database for example get user or delete user . And user class is the object it self.li ol  pOk my problem starts when there is a connection between objects not like manytomany or belonsto .For example , we have a video website which has a favorite system . The process of adding favorite consists of these steps 1check the video with this id, check the user with this id . validating steps. While we are just adding or updating just one object we user other objects too User factory and video factory. Generally i can do all this things in controller . But i fell that this is not the best place to do this . Because i call these steps as a process adding favorite process .So this process should not go in controller because we may want to use same process as an api in another controlleraction . So i feel like there should be another place which includes this processes for example process library. I do not even know which programing problem i am talking about.p  pThe connection between object does not just exist in validation step.For example think about search process. when user search a string first we have to create new search row for lastest searches stuff , then we have to search youtube , if we can not find we have to search other video sites etcetera .So this action is a process search process , i think putting the all logic in controller is a correct way to to this . we use lots of classes and objects so i can not put this process in search objects class .p  pThank you for everyone , Sorry for my english . i am very eager to learn more , i have been using php since i am 11 I am 19 now . i will be a college student next year i hope . i hope this will be a great place to learn more ask more and do more . I ask it now because i can not ignore these questions and wait until becoming college student. Even if you do not answer or you can not understand my question thank you for your reading. Please feel free to edit and improve my question . p  pI really like coding complex applications may be not complex for lots of you . I think that solving problems is very enjoyable.Therefore I am dying to learn what is the standarts of enterprise level coding .Maybe it is not necessary for my case . but i want to create my applications with the best programing approaches.p

Negative 997 pCan you call a function that has no body but is declared in the header in your code Please read below for my situation.p  pI am learning c so if my terminology is off then you know why. Any how, I am reading this book called Advanced 2D Game Development so if anyones read the book then maybe they can help me out. In c he set 4 extern functions in Advanced2D.hp  precodeextern bool gamepreload extern bool gameinitHWND extern void gameupdate extern void gameend codepre  pLater on down the line he calls on them several times in a class but never gives them a body. What he is eventually trying to do with all the code is compile it into lib file so other projects could include it and actually use those 4 methods.p  pHe wanted me to go to the solutions propertiesGeneralOutput Directory and add this in both the Release and Debug Configurationp  precodeProjectDir..libAdvance2D.lib  It didnt work. Still added the libs at default location codepre  pOnly to use those methods above in another project like this .

There   should be no dependencies for the   engine because the compiler assumes   that you will provide the needed libs   at link time when you create an   executable using the engines lib.   This is a rather complex issue that   well examine again over the next   several chapters as we enhance the   engine with new modules and   functionality.

Negative 997 pBefore you start marking this as a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions467271howrandomissystemguidnewguida duplicatea, read me out. The other question has a most likely incorrect accepted answer.p  pI do not know how .NET generates its GUIDs, probably only Microsoft does, but theres a high chance it simply calls a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibraryms688568VS.85.aspxCoCreateGuida. That function however is documented to be calling a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibraryaa379205VS.85.aspxUuidCreatea. And the algorithms for creating an UUID are a hrefhttpen.wikipedia.orgwikiUUIDpretty well documenteda.p  pLong story short, be as it may, it seems that codeSystem.Guid.NewGuidcode indeed uses a hrefhttpen.wikipedia.orgwikiUUIDVersion4.28random.29version 4 UUID generation algorithma, because all the GUIDs it generates matches the criteria see for yourself, I tried a couple million GUIDs, they all matched.p  pIn other words, these GUIDs are emstrongalmoststrongem random, except for a few known bits.p  pThis then again raises the question  how random strongISstrong this random As every good little programmer knows, a pseudorandom number algorithm is only as random as its seed aka entropy. So what is the seed for codeUuidCreatecode How ofter is the PRNG reseeded Is it cryptographically strong, or can I expect the same GUIDs to start pouring out if two computers accidentally call codeSystem.Guid.NewGuidcode at the same time And can the state of the PRNG be guessed if sufficiently many sequentially generated GUIDs are gatheredp  pstrongAddedstrong To clarify, Id like to find out how random can I trust it to be and thus  where can I use it. So, lets establish a rough randomness scale herep  ol liBasic randomness, taking current time as the seed. Usable for shuffling cards in Solitaire but little else as collisions are too easy to come by even without trying.li liMore advanced randomness, using not only the time but other machinespecific factors for seed. Perhaps also seeded only once on system startup. This can be used for generating IDs in a DB because duplicates are unlikely. Still, its not good for security because the results can be predicted with sufficient effort.li liCryptograhpically random, using device noise or other advanced sources of randomness for seed. Reseeded on every invocation or at least pretty often. Can be used for session IDs, handed out to untrusted parties, etc.li ol  pI arrived at this question while thinking if it would be OK to use them as DB IDs, and whether the a hrefhttpwww.informit.comarticlesarticle.aspxp25862Guid.comba algorithm implementation together with codeSystem.Guid.NewGuidcode like NHibernate does it would be flawed or not.p
Negative 997 pIm reviewing some old notes from my algorithms course and the dynamic programming problems are seeming a bit tricky to me.

We are trying to design a dynamic program to decide whether change for X can be made or not not minimizing the number of coins, or returning which coins, just true or false.p  pIve done some thinking about this problem, and I can see a recursive method of doing this where its something like...p  precodeMakeChangeX, x[1..n this is the coins]     for int i  1 i lt n i              if  X  x[i] 0  MakeChangeX  x[i]              return true          return false codepre  pConverting this a dynamic program is not coming so easily to me.

It makes sense because I have the same string in different HTML pages, for example, Login, so its duplicated. Im not sure about how to avoid all these duplicated messages Is there no other ways but to remove all the duplicated ones one by one manually I cant delete the strings in poeditp  pWhat Ive done is I renamed the .pot file to .po, and manually deleted all the duplicated strings, but I dont think its the proper way to do Plus in the future if I need to make any changes, if I do a djangoadmin.py makemessages l zhCN again, the .pot file will show up again and Ill have to manually change everything all over again, and all the translation Ive done to the .po file would no longer be there...

However, there are likely risks of alienating some users if the experience isnt the same as one would get on, say, a Galaxy Tab or the Motorola Xoom.p  pHere is an article on the topic a hrefhttpwww.slashgear.comblackberryplaybookandroidappsupportcomingin2h2011tipinsiders11132674 relnofollowhttpwww.slashgear.comblackberryplaybookandroidappsupportcomingin2h2011tipinsiders11132674ap  pWhat do app developers at large think about QNX facilitating thisp

Negative 997 pThe following declaration adds a couple of operators for compilation in a C file. The definition is included in both C and C files. p  pPCLint is reporting emError 114 Inconsistent structure declaration for tag Rectem but I am certain it is safe. p  pIm compiling with Visual Studio 2008.p  pstrongedit  adding the explanation I sent to my clientstrong p  pemWith regards to the Rect issue how does knowing that the struct is the same size in C and C eliminate the suspicion of undefined behaviour.emp  pUndefined behaviour occurs if the actual location of fields in the data structure varies according to compilation.p  pYou have to think of all member variable access as ultimately resolving to a pointer, calculated by a pointer to the beginning of the object storage plus an offset depending on what is in that structure.p  pPacking and data alignment settings influence the value of the offset.p  pThe compiler is allowed to reorder types for optimal access  it is undefined behaviour to assume that just because you declared two members in a given order that they are actually stored in that order. The only thing that declaration order guarantees is initialisation, copying and destruction order.p  pHowever, when you are talking about C and C compilation of a given structure within the same compiler, with the same offset settings, the chance of actual reordering is effectively zero.p  pThus the only thing we need worry about is any difference in the offset of fields.p  pFor a structure containing a simple 4 short integers, simply confirming that the C version and the C version are the same size guarantees that their offsets are all the same. To be more careful we can also check that the structure size  4sizeofshort.p  pI think its worth adding those checks but once that is done, theres no need to refactor the code as would be required to use separate types in C and C or to move the functions being used out into free functions.p  precode Maccompatible rectangle type with some operators added for C use. ingroup QuickdrawPort  struct Rect      short                           top     short                           left     short                           bottom     short                           right  ifdef cplusplus     Rectshort top0, short left0, short bottom0, short right0          toptop,         leftleft,         bottombottom,         rightright          ifdef WINNT   WinDef.h has been included         const Rectamp operatorconst tagRECTamp rhs              top  shortrhs.top             left  shortrhs.left             bottom  shortrhs.bottom             right  shortrhs.right             return this                   operator tagRECT const              tagRECT lhs             lhs.top  top             lhs.left  left             lhs.bottom  bottom             lhs.right  right             return lhs               endif WINNT     short height const  return bottom  top      short width const  return right  left      bool empty const  return rightleft  bottomtop       bool operatorconst Rectamp rhs const          return top  rhs.top ampamp             left  rhs.left ampamp              bottom  rhs.bottom ampamp             right  rhs.right      endif    ifndef cplusplus typedef struct Rect Rect endif codepre

In FF and Chrome it doesnt.  By chance I resized a FF windows and vioala... I got the eventAfterRender alerts and all of the calendar events showed up where they are supposed to.  I tried it on Chrome too and it did the same thing.  Its as if there needs to be some other event called in FF and Chrome to make the final event rendering execute.  p

Negative 997 pI have a Rails 3 based CMS that allows users to create and modify layouts and views.  These layouts and views are the same ones built into the framework, only backed by a model for some additional capabilities.  The problem I would like to address is that these template files are cached as soon as they are accessed on the public end, so it is not possible to see changes in the layouts or views unless the server is restarted.  This does not occur in development mode where caching is disabled, but obviously turning off template caching in production wouldnt be great for performance.  Clearing memcache doesnt seem to do the trick.  Is it possible to programatically clear out the layouts and views cache in production, perhaps with something like reload like we have in the console  Or am I stuck having to restart Passenger every time someone wants to tweak one of these layouts or views perhaps using the approach in this thread a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions2847859railscacheclearingRails Cache Clearingap  pPlease note that I am not referring to clearing the page and action caches, which the public pages rely on and works just fine.  p

Negative 997 pAs far as I understand, the Scala forcomprehension notation relies on the first generator to define how elements are to be combined. Namely, codefor i lt list yield icode returns a list and codefor i lt set yield icode returns a set.p  pI was wondering if there was a way to specify how elements are combined independently of the properties of the first generator. For instance, I would like to get emthe set of all elements from a given listem, or emthe sum of all elements from a given setem. The only way I have found is to first build a list or a set as prescribed by the forcomprehension notation, then apply a transformation function to it  building a useless data structure in the process.p  pWhat I have in mind is a general algebraic comprehension notation as it exists for instance in Ateji PXp  precode  i  int i  set                 the sum of all elements from a given set set  i  int i  list             the set of all elements from a given list concat,  s  String s  list    string concatenation with a separator symbol codepre  pHere the first element codecode, codesetcode, codeconcat,code is a socalled monoid that defines how elements are combined, independently of the structure of the first generator there can be multiple generators and filters, I just tried to keep the examples concise.p  pAny idea about how to achieve a similar result in Scala while keeping a nice and concise notation  As far as I understand, the forcomprehension notation is hardwired in the compiler and cannot be upgraded.p  pThanks for your feedback.p

Negative 997 pCommon advice is to keep your CSS and JS files external.  The reason What you lose in the additional HTTP request, you often gain back by not having to download cacheable static content which CSS and JS usually is.p  pHowever, the smaller your external file, the more penalizing the additional HTTP request  even if it is a a hrefhttpwww.w3.orgProtocolsrfc2616rfc2616sec10.htmlsec10.3.5304 Not Modifieda response.  So the smaller the external file, the more reason to favor inlining your CSS and JS content, at least when speed is your primary concern.p  pI ran some tests.  Without going through the details, my results look like thisp  precodeExternal File Size    Average Gain                 1KB          3.7ms                2KB          3.7ms                4KB          4.0ms                8KB          3.0ms               16KB          2.7ms               32KB           1.0ms               64KB           2.7ms              128KB          10.0ms              256KB         493.7ms              512KB        1047.0ms             1024KB        2569.7ms codepre  pMy general conclusion is that using external files doesnt really matter until they get strongemBIGemstrong.  And by strongemBIGemstrong, I mean the 50100KB range...

Negative 997 pTLDR I have a Derived that I store as a in Lua as a void userdata. Then I try to get it back as a Base and stuff breaks. Is there anything I can do or is this all madness thats doomed to failurep  pDetailsp  pIm passing some data back and forth between Lua and C, and Lua requires the use of void to store userdata That Im using Lua isnt too important, other than that it uses void pointers. Makes sense so far. Lets say I have three classes, codeBasecode and codeDerivedcode, with codeDerivedcode inheriting from codeBasecode. The userdata I feed to Lua is a pointer to a pointer, like sop  precodetemplate lttypename Tgt void luapushL, T obj      T ud  TluanewuserdataL, sizeofT  Create a new userdata     ud  obj  Set a pointer to my object      rest of the function setting up other stuff omitted  codepre  pOf course, this is in a nice templated function, so I can pass any of my three types in this way. Later on I can use another templated function to get my userdata out of Lua, like so p  precodetemplate lttypename Tgt T luatoluaState L, int index        theres normally a special metatable check here that ensures that       this is the type I want, Ive omitted it for this example     return TluatouserdataL, index  codepre  pThis works fine when I pass in and out the same type. Im running into a problem though when trying to pull a codeDerivedcode out as a codeBasecode. p  pIn my specific case, I have a vector being stored on codeBasecode. I use codeluapushltDerivedgtL, objcode to push my object to Lua. Later, in another place I pull it out using codeBase obj  luatoltBasegtL, icode. I then codepushbackcode some stuff into my vector. Later on, another portion of code pulls out that exact same object verified with pointer comparisons except this time uses codeDerived obj  luatoltDerivedgtL, icode My codeDerivedcode object doesnt see that object that was pushed in. I believe Ive narrowed this down to incorrect casting, and Im probably corrupting some memory somewhere when I make my call to codepushbackcodep  pSo my question is, is there a way to make that cast work right Ive tried the various flavors of casts. staticcast, dynamiccast and reinterpretcast dont seem to work, either giving me the same wrong answer or not compiling at all. p  pSpecific examplep  precodeBase b  luatoltBasegtL, 1  Both luatos looking at the same object Derived d  luatoltDerivedgtL, 1  You can be double sure because the pointers in the output match stdcout ltlt Base  ltlt b ltlt   ltlt bgtmyVec.size ltlt stdendl stdcout ltlt Derived  ltlt d ltlt   ltlt dgtmyVec.size ltlt stdendl codepre  pOutputp  precodeBase 0xa1fb470 1 Derived 0xa1fb470 0 codepre

Negative 997 pProblem find ids that are in one file but not in another.  Each file is about 6.5 GB.  Specifically for those in the bioinformatics domain, one file is a fastq file of sequencing reads and the other is a sam alignment file from a tophat run.  I would like to determine which reads in the fastq file are not in the sam alignment file.  p  pI am getting codejava.lang.OutOfMemory Java heap spacecode errors.  As suggested a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions4118123readaverylargetextfileintoalistinclojureref1a, a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions3538834howtoprocesslargebinarydatainclojureref2a I am using lazy sequences.  However, I am still running out of memory.  I have looked at a hrefhttpblog.malcolmsparks.comp17 relnofollowthis tutoriala, but I dont quite understand it yet. So I am posting my less sophisticated attempt at a solution with the hope that I am only making a minor mistake.p  pMy attemptp  pSince neither file will fit into memory, the lines from the sam file are read a chunk at a time and the ids of each line in the chunk are put into a set.  A lazy list of fastq ids are then filtered using the sam ids in the set keeping only those ids that are not in the set.  This is repeated with the next chunk of sam lines and the remaining fastq ids. p  precodedefn idsnotinsam    [ids samlines chunksize]   lazyseq     if seq samlines       idsnotinsam notin into  qnames take chunksize samlines ids                       drop chunksize samlines chunksize       ids codepre  pcodenotincode determines which ids are not in the set.p  precodedefn notin     Return the elements x of xs which are not in the set s   [s xs]   filter complement s xs codepre  pcodeqnamescode gets the id field from a line in the sam file.p  precodedefn qnames [samlines]   map first .split t  samlines codepre  pFinally, its put together with io using codereadlinescode and codewritelinescode from codeclojure.contrib.iocode.p  precodedefn writefqnotinsam [fqfile samfile fout chunksize]      iowritelines fout idsnotinsam map fqid readfastq fqfile                                          readsam samfile chunksize  codepre  pI am pretty sure I am doing every thing in a lazy manner.  But I may be holding onto the head of a sequence somewhere that I do not notice.  p  pIs there an error in the code above that is causing the heap to fill up  More importantly, is my approach to the problem all wrong  Is this an appropriate use for lazy sequences, am I expecting too muchp  pThe errors could be in the codereadsamcode and codereadfastqcode functions, but my post is already a bit long.

Negative 997 pFor my Java class, we need to make a bank account that has the methods of withdrawing, depositing money, and displaying current balance. In the Tester class, I want to make it ask for the name, the balance, then allow you to choose 1, 2, or 3. Then it repeats the option you choose until you say type n. The problem is that running this code causes it to say after you deposit money You deposited amount of money deposited in the account name of account. Your new balance is this. The part where it says this is the exact same of the amount of money deposited. In other words, it doesnt add it, it just makes the new balance the same as the deposit, regardless of how much was in before.

Negative 997 pWe are building a REST API using ASP.NET MVC. This API is similar in principle and usage to the Factual v3 API. They use 2legged Oauth 1 for their API. Our design is very similar in that applications, primarily mobile will use our API behind the scenes to provide a service. The end user of the application will not know about our API, and will therefore not have any credentials. So redirecting the user via a browser window to an auth form like facebook does not make any sense. My questions are..p  ul liWhy OAuth2 flow is the best to use in this scenarioli liShould we even use Oauth2 or just stick with 2legged OAuth 1li ul  pFor reference we are using C.NET, ASP.NET MVC 3 and plan on using DotNetOpenAuth v4.p  pa hrefhttpdeveloper.factual.comdisplaydocsFactualDeveloperAPIsVersion3 relnofollowhttpdeveloper.factual.comdisplaydocsFactualDeveloperAPIsVersion3ap

This work fine. Now my problem is that I dont know how i can pass the MOC from the appDelegate to my first ViewController because the Navigation controller is in the way. My current code in the appDidFinish Method looks like thisp  precode BOOLapplicationUIApplication application didFinishLaunchingWithOptionsNSDictionary launchOptions        Pass the managed object context to the root view controller     MainMenuViewController rootView  MainMenuViewController self.window.rootViewController     rootView.managedObjectContext  self.managedObjectContext       My actual Core data setup and adding data to it, it works Ive tested it.      return YES       codepre  pNow my code works when I change where the app launch arrow in the storyboard to point to my mainMenuViewController, but than I do however lose my navigation bar in all my views. I also know how to pass the MOC from my mainMenu to another view via the code voidprepareForSegueUIStoryboardSegue segue senderidsendercodebut I just cant seem to figure out how to do the initial pass from the appDelegate to the MainViewController because of the darn navigation controller being inbetween the two.p  pIve already searched numerous threads on this site and others and ive only found the solution for a Tabbed application and others want me to serialize the object, but for my purposes I cant do that. only a few views will receive the MOC and other will be passes data that one view has created and altered to be tailored for specific purposes in the unique viewsp  pAny help to this nub in iOS and ObjectiveC is greatly appreciated. Thank you in advance.p  pEDIT THe error i get is terminating app due to uncaught exception ... [UINavigationController setManagedObjectContext] unrecognized selector sent to instance...p
Negative 997 pDoes anyone had a successful experience with a hrefhttpvirtualkd.sysprogs.org relnofollowVirtualKDa setup on Linux host running VMWare Workstation 8 with Win7 guestsp  pDespite the facts theres a lot of admiring comments about speed and other benefits of that VirtualKD, most of them come from WindowsVirtualBox users, and I really dont want to waste my time on trying to get it working on unsupported configuration.p  pemP.S. Official VirtualKD forum has a similar thread that is a hrefhttpforum.sysprogs.orgviewtopic.phpf1ampt456 relnofollowstill unanswereda for two years, so decided to ask for reviews here.emp  pemP.P.S. My actual problem is that VMWares socketbased COM port debugging is very slow.. it takes 10 to 20x more time to copy debug output from debuggee to debugger machine, than it takes to print same output to DbgView.emp

Negative 997 pI have an application using hibernate. One of its modules calls a native SQL StoredProc in batch process. Roughly what it does is that every time it writes a file it updates a field in the database.

Negative 997 pFollowing setup causes troublep  pIn my storyboard I have a standard table view controller, containing a table view with three static cells as content. One of the cells contains another table view with dynamic content and a prototype cell in it. Both table views delegate and datasource are set to the same table view controller.

However, if the dynamic table view contains more than one element I get a codeNSRangeExceptioncode with code[NSArrayI objectAtIndex] index 1 beyond bounds [0 .. 0]code.

Negative 997 pMy application relies on the intent codeACTIONUSERPRESENTcode being fired, and so I set up a receiver in the manifest and I have a class that starts a service when it receives the intent.p  pHowever, when a user is using a lockscreen replacement app like WidgetLocker, the codeACTIONUSERPRESENTcode intent may never be sent, or can be sent a bunch of times. Once it was sent 5 times...  WidgetLockers website explains that the application emdoesem send its own intent for unlocking, codecom.teslacoilsw.widgetlocker.intent.UNLOCKEDcode.  In certain configurations of WidgetLocker, codeACTIONUSERPRESENTcode may be fired before the user even unlocks the screen, so I was told that it would be best to set up a check for codecom.teslacoilsw.widgetlocker.intent.LOCKEDcode, and then wait to receive the codeUNLOCKEDcode intent and do my work.p  pMy problem is that Im not sure how to set up a receiver for a third party intent.  Ive added the actions to my receiver in the manifest just find, and I know that my broadcast receiver picks them up, but I need to filter them out.

Negative 997 pSo, I am designing with a fixed width. I just want the gutters to be flexible. So, I tried just using parent divs with 100 width. As you can see in this fiddlep  pa hrefhttpjsfiddle.netP3Ckk115 relnofollowhttpjsfiddle.netP3Ckk115ap  pWhat I intended was for what is happening with the fixed div nav div to happen. When the user window gets too small, Id like the 100 width to collapse upon the fixed width elements in this case, 1000px and enable horizontal scrolling.p  pHowever, my parent width100 does not work like that with relative positioning. The top title and container divs all stop at whereever the screen stops. I suppose that is 100 but it leaves the fixed width content overflowing these now smaller parent divsp  pAdditionally, the problem also shows up when a vertical scrollbar comes down. The area to the vertical scrollbar is considered 100 and the remaining gets left blank. This also creates a horizontal scrollbar to view this extra part.p  pWhat is the best solution here Should I abandon my parent div 100 width approach p  pIve tried making the these 100 divs have minwidth1000px, but that doesnt seem to work. Im just a bit stumped here.p  pAny help appreciated. Thanksp

Negative 997 pI have a bit of a paradox.p  pIm trying to use TDD to build tests for my password hashing methods before I build the implementation.  But I dont how to come up with the expected values beforehand, without first building the implementation.p  pOf course, with simple hashing implementation, I can probably find a site to create the expected values based on the known passwordsalt.p  pIm betting the solution is to make an exception for TDD and forgo building my tests first.  Rather, build my implementation to come up with the proper salthash values, then build my tests against those values to prevent regression.p  pBut I thought I would post this to see if theres a solution Im not thinking of.  p  pOr, maybe theres someone out there that can generate hashes in their head in order to build the tests first.p

Negative 997 blockquote   pstrongPossible Duplicatestrongbr   a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions1759300whenshouldiwritethekeywordinlineforafunctionmethodWhen should I write the keyword 39inline39 for a functionmethoda  p blockquote    pSo this is a question that has bugged me for a while and I cant get a definitive answer. My understanding is that a good compiler will generally realise when it is both safe and advantageous to inline a function and, if optimisation is switched on, it will inline all such functions weather they they are explicitly identified as inline functions by the programmer or not. Also, a complier will recognise when it is not safesensible to inline a function and will simply ignore the programmers request to inline functions in such cases.p  pThus, I would like to know what is the advantage of explicitly stating a function as inline As long as optimisation is switched on the compiler will inline all the functions it deems sensible to inline, and only those functions.p  pI have found some discussions around inline protecting against multiple definitions due to nested h files, but surely ifdefineing the header source code is better practice and again renders the use of the key word inline voidp

To maintain the clients backward compatibility with prehotfix behavior, I implemented the hotfix as a configurable setting in the app. Thus I didnt want to emreplaceem my old code  just patch it when the setting was turned on. I did this by a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions717506ifmonkeypatchingispermittedinbothrubyandpythonwhyisitmorecontrovemonkey patchinga.p  h2Code Structureh2  pThe codemaincode module reads in the configuration file. If the configuration turns on the hotfixs switch, codemaincode patches my codeenginecode module by replacing a couple of functions with code defined in the codehotfixcode module  in essence, the function being replaced is the a hrefhttpdocs.python.orgpy3klibraryfunctions.htmlmaxkey function to a maximization functiona. The codeenginecode module later loads up a pool of a hrefhttpdocs.python.orgpy3klibrarymultiprocessing.htmlcodemultiprocessingcodea workers.p  h2The Problemh2  pOnce a codemultiprocessingcode worker gets started, the first thing codemultiprocessingcode does it a hrefhttpstackoverflow.coma79944651286628reimportsa the codeenginecode module and looks for the key function that codemaincode had tried to replace then codemultiprocessingcode hands over control to my code and the maximization algorithm begins.

I do have that relationship added though it doesnt seem to be doing anything in particular, and I feel as if all of my table references are correct though I havent added anything to users as Im using devise and didnt feel like I needed to add anything as the post is a separate object itself.p  pAs of right now, I can show all of the comments in general, as in I am able to create and save them. I was also saving, at the very least, the codeuseridcode variable, so it can understand which account is making the comment. Im not really sure wherewhen I should be passing in the codepostidcode, so thats the biggest issue. Any way Ive tried to do it in the codepostscontrollercode since in theory I should be able to edit that attribute when the post page is loaded, I get anp  precodeundefined method postid codepre  porp  precodeno postid column codepre  perror, indicating that it doesnt exist, even though as far as I understand, Ive defined it. The fact that the codeuseridcode is able to be saved, as mentioned before, further confuses me.p  pIf I show the attributes on a comment created in my show view, I get the followingp  precode     idgt1,     contentgttext here,     postedgtSat, 03 Nov 2012 203653 UTC 0000,     useridgt1,     createdatgtSat, 03 Nov 2012 203653 UTC 0000,     updatedatgtSat, 03 Nov gt2012 203653 UTC 0000  codepre  pThere is no codepostidcode, although I did add it into the migration table for comments. Trying to pass the codepost.idcode in the posts controller to a show methods instance of a comment, as it would be available beneath a post gives a mass assignment error. Messing around with the codeclasscode and codeforeignkeycode options hasnt done much, either. Based on the research I have done, which includes some of Rails own documentation, I dont believe I need a codehasmanycode through relationship, but I dont know where Im missing what I need to have the information save accordingly.p  pPerhaps this is all due in part to my lacking understanding of databasemodel relationship design, although any help is appreciated. I have seen a couple of similar questions but I still find it difficult to apply their solutions to the context of my own particular issue.p

Negative 997 pMy scenario is as follows I have a form with three addresses, each as a composite component. Each address has a link to copy it from one of the other two. The link sets target and source address via codefsetPropertyActionListenercode, then calls a Bean method to do the actual copying based on these parameters. The link has an codefajaxcode that only executes the source address and renders the target address. This way, users can copy even if other addresses on the page e.g. the one they want to copy to have validation errors. Since the target fields are potentially invalid and thus marked red in my case, but are not processed during the Ajax request I use codepresetInputcode Primefaces to have them reset. p  pThis is were my problem lies The reset works fine in that it does remove the invalid status and styleClass. The field itself looks perfectly fine. However, the error message I attached to it is still visible and will only vanish on a refresh. I thought the reset  rerender would take care of this, but alas it doesnt. p  pMy next attempt was to extend the copy method so that it will clear the list of messages at the codeFacesContextcode, but this wont work When I actually reach my Bean method, it means that the current context passed validation for the fields that are part of the codeexecutecode and thus has no messages.p  pSo, the question is Is there a way to access the previously attached messages of the notprocessed components Based on a hrefhttpstackoverflow.coma6845800840977this answera Im thinking something likep  ul ligetting the target compositeli litraverse its childrenli licheck for messages on each component and, if any, delete them wouldnt know how, though ...li ul  pBut maybe I am thinking this wrong. Im not sure if the messages are even still there or if this this is some sort of updatingtheview problem In that case I would need to know how to also reset the input message components currently coderendercode uses an enclosing codehpanelGroupcode as target, which asfaik should properly rerender the messages, just like it does with the inputs ...p  pAny help appreciated.p  hr  pReduced it to the following examplep  h3test.xhtmlh3  precodelthinputText idstring1 valuetestBean.string1 stylecomponent.valid    backgroundcolorredgt     ltfvalidateLength minimum4 gt     ltfajax renderthis msg1 gt lthinputTextgt lthmessage idmsg1 forstring1 gt ltbr gtltbrgt  lthinputText idstring2 valuetestBean.string2 stylecomponent.valid    backgroundcolorredgt     ltfvalidateLength minimum4 gt     ltfajax renderthis msg2 gt lthinputTextgt         lthmessage idmsg2 forstring2 gtltbr gtltbrgt  lthcommandButton actionListenertestBean.actionCopyString valueClick megt     ltfajax executestring1 renderstring2 gt     ltpresetInput targetstring2 gt lthcommandButtongt codepre  h3TestBeanh3  precodeManagedBeanname  testBean ViewScoped public class TestBean      private String string1     private String string2       getters  setters      public void actionCopyString      string2  string1       codepre  h3Behaviorh3  pEnter a valid string into field one at least four characters.

Negative 997 pI have a C multithreaded application which run tasks in separate threads. Each task have an object which handles and stores its output.  Each task create different business logic objects and probably another threads or threadpools.p  pWhat I want to do is somehow provide an easy way for any of business logic objects which are run by task to access each tasks output without manually passing output object to each business logic object.p  pWhat i see is to create output singleton factory and store taskid in TLS. But the problem is when business logic create a new thread or thread pool and those thread would not have taskid in TLS. In this way i would need to have an access to parents thread TLS.p  pThe other way is to simply grab all output since tasks start. There would be output from different task in that time, but at least, better than nothing...p  pIm looking for any suggestions or ideas of clean and pretty way of solving my problem.

Negative 997 pDetails of my endeavour below, they are only partly relevant to my questionp  pIn a map from procpidmaps on an embedded linux arm with kernel version 2.6.37.6, the offset of the first line the code segment of the executable itself seems to be wrong.p  pI always see a line likep  p0000800000061000 rxp 00000000 0010 8073509    myprogp  pthe range is the address in the processes address space, the number after the permissions is supposed to be the offset into the filep  pHowever, the actual offset seems to be 0x8000  at least, interpretations using this assumption look much more credible. nm shows me that myprog doesnt have code before 0x8000, so that would make sense too.p  pCould someone give me a pointer to where I can find out more about this I could not find anything.p  pWhat I am doing I have written a tool to interpret logs generated by mtrace, find possible memory leaks, and trace them back to the code allocating the data. For the latter step, I take an instruction pointer from the log, look it up in the runtime map from procpidmaps to find the executable or library in question, and use their nmmap to find the actual function doing the allocation.p  pThis works like a charm for everything but the executable itself.p

Negative 997 pim trying to develop a digital signage application for the company i work for, with flash cs6. it is actually composed of two applications, one is server side, and other is installed on tv displays that have an integrated computer running windows xp. the server application is nothing but a form that an administrator uses to enter data that is stored in a mysql database through some php. that is working fine.p  pmy problem is with the client that runs in the displays. the app is actually quite simple there are sections of different sorts of information that it should load from the mysql tables, therefore loading text, image and videos that are all stored in the server. thing is the loaders run in parallel with timers. the timers are responsible for calling movieclips and frames, so that i dont need to animate everything in the timeline and the app keeps running from section to section in loop. and there is where im finding problems. i am not being able to find a proper way to program such loaders in a way that goes along well with the timers. so the final result is that images and videos are partially or never loaded, making the client app run in odd ways. heres an example of one of the sections of the appp  precodeimport flash.utils.Timer import flash.display.MovieClip import flash.events.Event import flash.events.TimerEvent import fl.transitions.

Negative 997 pI am developing an Backbone.Marionette with Boilerplate framework structure. in App.js  I am setting up the layout of the page inside App.initLayout function, by adding regions  regionNav, regionMain, regionFooter. The views to be shown on different routes are handled in the Controller.js  in controller I have app defined. What I want is to just load the view for regionMain in controller for different links but I get regions that I ve laid down in App.js as undefined. Therefore to tackle this I add regions bye using App.addRegions method in the contoller and add footer and navigation view to it for each route function call, this is not correct it should only load the view in regionMain. Please help in how I can resolve this issue.p

Negative 997 pId like to implement two fullscreen modes on my OS X app, Ive hooked up the window to use the Lion Fullscreen window API, but I also want to allow users to get a fullscreen experience on one monitor, without losing screens in a multiscreen setup.p  pIs this simply a case of hiding the titlebar and sizing to the active display dimensions manually, or is there a apilibrary I can use eg. that has a nice animated transitionsp  pThank you. p  pPlease excuse me if this a duplicate, I could only find references to Lions fullscreen.p

Negative 997 pI decided to try using Weinre to help me debug a Cordova application Im trying to build for Windows Phone 8 sadly, Ive run into an odd issue where the Windows Phone 8 Emulator can connect to my local weinre config and then after a few seconds disappears... I tried this on another windows 2012 and I seem to be encountering the same thing. I even tried with a base Cordova template.p  pSo, when I debug my application from VS2012, the emulator starts and the application deploys. I know that I cant use LOCALHOST, so my script reference is to the IP address of my computer or server. The apps starts, and I can go to the Weinre console and I see that I have a connection. But after a few seconds the connection vanishes. It seems like the Emulator cannot maintain a constant connection to weinre... Is there some kind of bandwidth limitor on the emulator that cuts my connection Is there a better way to remote debug Win Phone 8 apps that I should be using insteadp  pstrongUPDATEstrong I also tried this from my Nokia 920, and I see the same thing happens...p

Negative 997 pI have a doubt about the object IGrouping that results from a linq where I use a group by sentence.p  pI have two tables in the database, Products and Responses they have a relationship 1 to . In the Responses table we have a column called FinalRate which is the rate of the product. The products can have n responses or rates.p  pI want to get the Products order by the sum of the FinalRate divided by the number of rates done. That is to say, order by the average rate descending from higher to lower marks.p  pAs it can be read in the code at the end of the question, I try to get the responses first. To sum all the finalrates and divide them by the count I use a group.p  pThere are 2 problems with the code, even if the current code worksp  p1.I tried to get the Products in a single query but it is impossible because I can not use the products table in the group and then use the Response table in the orderby. One more thing LINQ only gives you the possibility to group one table, it is imposible to have group prod, response.  I couldnt get this sql sentence in LINQp  precodeselect prod.ProductID,prod.CommercialProductName,prod.ManufacturerName, prod.ProductImageUrl   from revproduct prod   inner join revresponse res on res.AtProductidprod.ProductID  group by prod.ProductID,prod.CommercialProductName,prod.ManufacturerName ,prod.ProductImageUrl   order by sumres.FinalRatecountres.AtProductid codepre  pI tried thisp  precodevar gruposproductos  from prod in ctx.Products                         join res in ctx.Responses on prod.ProductID equals res.AtProductId                          group  prod by prod.ProductID into g                            orderby g.Sumra gtra.FinalRateg.Count                        descending select g.Take2 codepre  pBut as I say, the orderby g.Sum... gives an error, because into g groups the Product table, not the Response Table.p  pSo this is why in my final code I dont get the products in the same LINQ sentence.p  p2.Once accepted this fact, the problem is that I get an IGrouping, but I dont obtain a list of Responses that I can iterate without doing the two foreach in the code. I wanted only one loop, as one would do if you had a List object.p  pIt is not really a cool method but it works.

Negative 997 pI am working with expando object and I am trying to define a calculated property.p  pI know that I can define a simple property by doing something like the followingp  precodedynamic myExpando  new ExpandoObject myExpando.TheAnswerToLifeTheUniverseAndEverything 42 codepre  pLikewise, I can also define a methodp  precodemyExpando.GetTheQuestion  Funcltstringgt gt                      return How many road must a man walk down before we can call him a man            codepre  pWhen working with a standard object we can define a calculated property, ie define a property that will return the results of a custom methodcalc. No need for an example.p  pI need to do something similar on my expando  having a property that actually calls a Func or some other form of delegate, anything goes as soon as I can call a custom method and have a custom return type. So basically I need to invoke a method like in the second example BUT have it work like a property.p  pBasically I need to be able to call it with strongmyExpando.GetTheQuestionstrong instead of strongmyExpando.GetTheQuestionstrong, while keeping the ability of defining a custom delegate as the property body.p  pIs there a way to do this I belive that I emcouldem do this by using Expression trees, but I admit I am a little lost there. Can anyone provide some guidance on how to achieve thisp  hr  pstrongEDITstrongp  pDone some more research.. Unless there is some very specific classinterfacesintax that I dont know I am starting to think that the above is impossible. From what I get, the ExpandoObject class works by defining some methods that do the background plumbing  TryGetMember, TrySetMember and such. Now when accessing a property on the dynamic objetc, TryGetMember is the memeber that gets called. That member returns a value from a sort of inner dictionary yes, I know... this is a little simplified but should give the idea... no test on the type of value returned. This means that in my example emmyExpando.GetTheQuestionem would return the original Func.p  pIt would seem that since TryGetMember just returns a value, there is no way to make it execute the property code. To achieve that, you would need some sort of expressionlambdafuncaction surrogate which value is actually the RESULT of a method. Which seems impossible nor would make much sense unless I miss something  basically you would have a value that is set to a delegate and then is get as the delegate return value. Am I correct or this or I am missing somethingp

Negative 997 pWeve hit a problem with some forms in the admin portion of our web app.  There are a handful of forms that contain a large number of fields it can range anywhere from one input field to the hundreds.p  pWeve found that as these forms grow, there is a point where the server will throw 500 errors when a form is posted.p  pAfter running a test, I was able to find that the server can handle forms with 100 fields in them once 101 or more fields are used, we get the errors.p  pWe run Coldfusion, and we have determined that Coldfusion is not throwing this error.  We never see this error logged in Coldfusion, so we are assuming IIS is throwing an error even before it sends the request to the Coldfusion server.p  pIm assuming there is some setting in IIS 7.5 where we can up this limit.  Ive searched on the web, but all I can find is how to raise the bytesize limits of this data, not any kind of limit on a number of fields that are allowed.p  pSo, am I right in assuming that this can be changed, and if so, how can it be donep
Negative 997 pI have a question about best practice in downloading data using NSOperation.  Currently I am using NSOperationQueue to make multiple requests for JSON data on a remote server.  When the data comes in I break it apart into one large NSDictionary and use for loops to parse it out and load the data into NSMutableDictionaries before I go on to the next request. My question is that I am performing this same sequence many times over and over again and I am wondering if it would be a better idea to just download the data and after all the downloads have been completed, then parse out my JSON into the needed Dictionaries, maybe there is a better way to do this that I am just not thinking of I checked the total allocations using instruments and it looks like the I am pilling up around 30mb during this process.p  pWould appreciate any kind of advice on this matter.p  pHere is a small sample of NSOperation Codep  precode          plantPackKeys  [NSMutableDictionary dictionaryWithDictionarydata]           queueTwo  [NSOperationQueue new]           [queueTwo setMaxConcurrentOperationCount4]            forid key in data              autoreleasepool                  urlKey                   urlKey  [data objectForKeykey]                 DownloadOperation downLoad  [[DownloadOperation alloc] initWithURL[NSURL URLWithStringurlKey]]                 [downLoad addObserverself forKeyPathisFinished optionsNSKeyValueObservingOptionNew contextNULL]                 [queueTwo addOperationdownLoad]                           codepre

One of these is a ListFragment actually SherlockListFragment.

Negative 997 pIm trying to understand the differences between different implementations of the concept of pipes.

With emconduitem, if the left pipe finished, its result is sent downstream to the right pipe.p  pI wonder, what is the benefit of emconduitems approach Id like to see some example preferably realworld which is easy to implement using emconduitem and codegtgtcode, but harder to implement using empipesem and codegtgtcode.p

Negative 997 pI would like to generate dynamic text geometries given a ttf font file, and read from the Three.js a hrefhttpsgithub.commrdoobthree.jswikiTextinThree.js relnofollowwikia that the only procedural way to do this is to embed a Typeface.js converted font file.p  pUnfortunately, I cannot find anywhere an online ttftypeface converter. Indeed, the Typeface library site is down since a long time now, and Im afraid it will never go online again. p  pThe blender exporter solution exposed on the wiki doesnt seem to fit my needs either, first because Im a blender total newbie, but mainly because it seems to be appropriate for static text only. I need a dynamic solution, and I need text geometry and not textures because I want to deform the text as I draw it along curves, with extrusions and bevels.p  pIs there any alternative way to do what Im trying to do, or am I stuck with the basic font files provided with the threejs lib and have only my eyes for cry p  pThanks a lotp

Negative 997 pIn the game that I am currently working on I dont want the zombies to be able to overlap each other. Therefore, I want to make it so that when they do collide with each other they will get moved back to the x and y they were on right before the collision. p  pI have tried to make it so that it updates the zombies x and y position as long as they do not collide with any zombies with this statement codeifr1.intersectsr2code coder1code and coder2code are the bounding boxees for the two zombies that collide and then setting the zombie x and y to the x and y that was determined in the codeifr1.intersectsr2code statement in this statement codeifr1.intersectsr2code.                               p  pFor some reason all the zombies will overlap and look like only one zombie. I guess all the zombies will teleport to that x and y when two collide, but I have done it so that only the zombies that collides will get afected. It works when I make it so that one of the zombies will move its y and x up with 1 pixel and the other one will move its x any y down with one pixel, but the problem then is that in the beginning, when there are a lot of zombies, they will all move a lot faster than the ones later on. p  pI have tried to solve this problem by making the zombies faster every time one of them dies but I havent gotten that to work for some reason. I tried that by having a codedoublecode called speed that got the value of the zombie speed and then doing something like codespeed  .1code in the method that checked the collision between the player bullet and the zombie but they still didnt get any faster when i shot one of them.

Negative 997 pWe have an ASP.NET 4.0 website, and we use the ApplicationBeginRequest event in Global.asax to do some smart redirects.

Negative 997 pFirstly to explain, we have some websites which all connect to a central database. As a rule we dont give clients access to the FTP for their website so they cant access any files with the DB credentials in them. 99.9 of the time this is fine.p  pHowever we are having a client insisting they have full FTP access. They want to add advertising  tracking stuff in, and I have set them up their own database and a locked down FTP in another directory, but thats not good enough apparently.p  pNow I am sure they dont intend to steal our mysql credentials and connect and wipe out our DBs but no doubt you will agree its a huge security risk.p  pIs there any way top  pa connect to the database without them seeing the credentials within the codep  pb stopping them from adding their own code and connecting to the central database, only their ownp  pPretty sure nothing is going to be 100 secure, as giving them FTP access means they can do the same as I can, but wondering if anyone else has any ideasp

Negative 997 pIn my C application, I am sending UDP messages by calling codeSocket.SendTocode potentially up to 10,000 times per second. I know that it is sometimes unable to keep up with how much I am sending. Is there a way to check how much data in bytes, or number of times Ive called codeSendTocode, etc. it has queued or backlogged to send p  pMy ideal solution would be to drop the nonessential messages if the socket starts running behind and let the essential messages be queued by the socket, so knowing the socket status before I call codeSendTocode would be quite helpful.p  pThanksp

Negative 997 pI noticed that whenever a thread that runs with a codeLoopercode object is finished i.e. codeLooper.quitcode is called, some files remain open 3 files usually. You can see that by running strongadb shell ls procfd  wc lstrong This happens because the codeMessageQueuecode inside codeLoopercode is never freed, although its never used. Only if I call the codefinalizecode method on the codeMessageQueuecode, then these files are freed. The files may remain open hours after the thread is finished. This causes a problem when these threads run in system process because there are many open files already, and I cant exceed the 1024 file boundary. BTW even when I call codeSystem.gccode it doesnt finalize codeMessageQueuecodep  pIs there anyway without using reflection to have codeMessageQueuecode finalize method invoked It seems to me like a bug in Android that the GC doesnt do it by itself even when the number of open files is big.p  pThanksp

Negative 997 pI have a .NET 4.5 program that basically runs a loop in which the same stored procedure is executed many times, using the same codeSqlConnectioncode. If a command timeout occurs, it is incremented and the query is rerun this is for testing purposes, in the real application the input parameters to the SP would be modified.p  pThe stored procedure in question can be found below. Basically it is a mix of codeSELECTDELETEUPDATEcode statements. It starts with codeSET XACTABORT ONcode and contains no codeBEGIN TRANcode or codeROLLBACK TRANcode statements.p  pAfter running this program for a while, it seems that the queries are starting to run really slow. Restarting the program does not help, the queries are still running slow. It appears that this slowdown happens after a command timeout has occurred. But running the same query in sql server management studio shows no slowdown.p  pI did some troubleshooting, and copied the SQL and pasted it in a query window in SQL Server Management Studio and tried running it from there After a codeCHECKPOINT DBCC DROPCLEANBUFFERScode, and within a codeBEGIN TRANROLLBACK TRANcode. It ran in about 4 seconds. Consecutive runs takes about 0.5 seconds. p  pThen I did the same from a new .NET console application, and the query was running extremely slow, about 48 seconds this is the duration shown by the SQL Server as well, so it is really executing the query that takes this amount of time. Consecutive runs takes about 17 seconds.p  pSimply running an codeALTERcode command to update the SP without changing it actually solves the problem, and the queries run fast everywhere again, until they start running slow again. p  pI have also tried using codeSqlConnection.ClearAllPoolscode, but this does not appear to help.p  pWhat on earth can cause this behavior I cant think of any reason why SQL Server would start behaving this way.  Why would a query suddenly start running faster if an SP is updated And why would it slow down in the first place, but only from connections from .NETp  pstrongEditstrong  I have now also tried to codeKILLcode all SPIDs possible from codesys.sysprocessescode that were using the database in question. There are a number of system processes that cannot be killed, but this did not resolve the problem.  codesys.dmtranlockscode shows no locks being held Except a single shared database lock.p  pstrongEdit 2strong Bringing the database offline, and then back online also seems to remedy the problem.

Negative 997 pI have SQL SPs that I use to populate DataTables in VB and those to fill listboxcharts etc in VB form.  In VB I am trying to use OOP and thus use classes for variables.  In VB I have a function with the code to pull the data using a SP, this function I want to use everytime I pull data, so with every different data request you send different inputs, parameters to the function.p  pI can achieve this for input parameters which are of integer data type, however I am stuck with doing the same for DataTable type.  If I can I would like to use the same DataTable, but when you run the function again to fill another containerlistbox, then chart etc the first container loses its data and is empty, since the DataTable is loaded with new data.  This is ofcourse after the first dataset has been used to fill the first container.  Which leads me to thinking the DataTable has a permanent link to the container to keep it populatedp  pThis led me to trying to declare multiple DataTables and passing a different one for every container.  Here I get the problem to declare and pass DataTable type. Any solution to this problem  Another question is, is it possible to have a DataTable class  I use MS SQL Server 2012 amp MS Visual Studio 2010.p  pThis is how my function to fill a DataTable looksp  precodePublic Function outputDataByVal begDate, ByVal endDate, ByVal ID1, ByVal proC, ByRef dDataTable     If conn.State  ConnectionState.Open Then pData.Clear      SQLcomm  New SqlClient.SqlCommandproC, conn     SQLcomm.CommandType  CommandType.StoredProcedure     SQLcomm.Parameters.AddWithValuebegDate, SqlDbType.Date.Value  begDate     SQLcomm.Parameters.AddWithValueendDate, SqlDbType.Date.Value  endDate     SQLcomm.Parameters.AddWithValueID1, SqlDbType.Int.Value  ID1       aDapter.SelectCommand  SQLcomm     aDapter.FilldDataTable      Return pData  End Function codepre  pproC is the SQL procedure parameter, dDataTable the DataTable parameter.  Any tips will be appreciated.p  pThank you,p
Negative 997 pSo I started making the admin panel of our site as a plugin.

Negative 997 pI am having trouble making a query which must behave as followingp  pImagine a table named codeUserscode with these column names codeid, name, votecode.p  pThe codevotecode column holds the id of a row.

Negative 997 pIs it possible to create an array of multiple ordered tuples of different types in C For example, I would like to be able to make an array of tuples of which every tuple contains one int, one string and one double So something likep  precode  vectorltpairltpairltint, stringgt, doublegt gt codepre  pWith this I could have a tuple 2,3, 5.43.

And the order could also be different. Is it possible to do something like this in C or I will have to switch to Pythonp

Negative 997 pI am storing many chunks of base64 encoded 64bit doubles in an XML file. The double data all looks similar.p  pThe double data is currently being compressed using the java Deflate algorithm before the encoding, however each chunk of binary data in the file will have its own deflate data dictionary, which is an overhead I would like to greatly lessen. The Deflater class has a setDictionary method which I would like to use.p  pSo questions arep  p1. Does anyone have any suggestions for how to best build my own single custom data dictionary based on multiple sections of doubles x8 bytes that could he used for multiple deflate operations, i.e. use the same dictionary for all the compressions Should I be looking for common bytes across all byte arrays, with the commonest byte put at the end of the dictionary arrayp  p2. Can I separate the custom data dictionary from the deflated data, and then set the dictionary against the deflated data later before inflating the data againp  p3. Will the deflate algorithm take my custom data dictionary, and then just create its own slightly different data dictionary anyway, both invalidating my singular data dictionary and lessening the potential space saving from using a singular data dictionaryp  p4. Can someone elaborate on the structure of zlib compressed data, so that I myself may try to separate the data dictionary from the compressed datap  pI want to only use space for the data dictionary once in my file, and use it for each block of my double data in my filebut not store it with the double data. If the data dictionary cannot be separated from the deflated datastored separately, then it seems that there would be little value in building a custom singular dictionary as each compressed block would have its own dictionary anyway. Is this rightp

As an examplep  pre classlanghs prettyprintoverridecode LANGUAGE DeriveFunctor  module TestingFree where  import Control.Monad.Free  data BellsF x      Ring x      Chime x     deriving Functor, Show  type Bells  Free BellsF  data WhistlesF x      PeaWhistle x      SteamWhistle x     deriving Functor, Show  type Whistles  Free WhistlesF  ring  Bells  ring  liftF  Ring   chime  Bells  chime  liftF  Chime   peaWhistle  Whistles  peaWhistle  liftF  PeaWhistle   steamWhistle  Whistles  steamWhistle  liftF  SteamWhistle    playBells  Bells r gt IO r playBells Pure r          return r playBells Free Ring x   putStrLn RingRing gtgt playBells x playBells Free Chime x  putStr Dingdong gtgt playBells x  playWhistles  Whistles  gt IO  playWhistles Pure                  return  playWhistles Free PeaWhistle x    putStrLn Preeeet gtgt playWhistles x playWhistles Free SteamWhistle x  putStrLn Choochoo gtgt playWhistles x codepre  pNow, I would like to be able to create a type codeBellsAndWhistlescode that allows me to combine the functionality of both codeBellscode and codeWhistlescode without much effort.p  pSince the problem is combining monads, my first thought was to look at the codeControl.Monad.Trans.Freecode module for a quick and easy solution.  Unfortunately, there are sparse examples and none showing what I want to do.  Also, it seems that stacking two or more free monads doesnt work, since codeMonadFreecode has a functional dependency of codem gt fcode.  Essentially, Id like the ability to write code likep  pre classlanghs prettyprintoverridecodenewtype BellsAndWhistles m a  BellsAndWhistles      unBellsAndWhistles        deriving          Functor         , Monad          Whatever else needed           noisy  Monad m gt BellsAndWhistles m  noisy  do     lift ring     lift peaWhistle     lift chime     lift steamWhistle  play  BellsAndWhistles IO  gt IO  play bellsNwhistles  undefined codepre  pBut in such a way that codeBellscode and codeWhistlescode can exist in separate modules and dont have to know about each others implementations.  The idea is that I can write stand alone modules for different tasks, each implementing its own DSL, and then having a way to combine them into a larger DSL as needed.  Is there an easy way to do thisp  pAs a bonus itd be great to be able to leverage the different codeplaycode functions that are already written, in such a way that I can swap them out.  I want to be able to use one free interpreter for debug and another in production, and itd obviously be useful to be able to choose which DSL was being debugged individually.p

Negative 997 pSo, I would like to have a Windows Phone app connected at ALL TIME with a Windows service. That means that the service would need to know if a device has been turned off or lost network connection within seconds after it happens. On iOS and Android we keep this connection up with sockets. But this doesnt seems to be possible with background tasks on Windows Phonep  pIs there somehow we could ping the serverservice more often then every 30 mins from a scheduled task The app will only be used by known people so if there is a possibility to fake a music app och location app that would do it.

Negative 997 h2Update 252014h2  h2Problem was resolved by rebooting the Linux server hosting the Oracle database.  The server had not been booted since May of last year even though Oracle itself had been restarted on a regular basis.h2  pI have a couple of Java 1.6 programs that use an Oracle 11.2 database and the 11.2.0.3.0 ojdbc6.jar Oracle driver.  At seemingly random points it will apparently hang, never returning control from PreparedStatement.executeUpdate.p  pFrequently my program binds data to a BLOB column and in this case again at random times it may hang at a call to OutputStream.flush, where my OutputStream is a wrapper for the OracleBlobOutputStream.p  pIn both cases the thread is stuck waiting forever trying to read a socket for an Oracle response before it will continue.p  pMonitoring sessions in the Oracle database for my JDBC Thin Client with sqlDeveloper I can see that the session is waiting as shown with Seconds In Wait.   In the particular case of of flushing a blob, the ActiveSQL tab shows No Text Available.  In the case of hanging at PreparedStatement.executeUpdate that tab will show the full text of my insert statement. In either case the Waits tab will show SQLNet more data from client, which to me indicates that the Oracle server is waiting for more data to complete the client request.p  pSo I can see that the Oracle server seems to be waiting for the client to finish his request.  The client seems to have completed the request and is waiting for the server to return a response.p  pCould network errors be the cause of this  I would think the client and server would be protected by the retry logic of a TCPIP stream.  I frequently use this application over a VPN connection on the internet against test instances of the database where Id expect more errors but I never see a problem in that context.p  pIve seen fixes for a getNextPacket issue in the Oracle driver but as shown above were using the latest driver and should have those.p  pThe Contention tab never indicates anything, as I would expect.  From everything I can tell competing transactions are not the issue here.  And the program will still fail at night, when theres hardly any other activity than my program.p  pThis code works flawlessly in my test environment.  It also works in a test environment at my clients site.  But in the production environment it fails.  It may insert 50100K rows of data before failing.p  pIn some cases it does not hang.  It throws inconsistent exceptions such as one about how you can only bind a LONG value to a LONG column.  This too I never see in testing on four different databases and the problem moves around from one table to another with no discernible pattern.p  pTo the best of my knowledge dynamic SQL will work and the problem is specific to prepared statements.  But I cant be certain of that.p  pThis production database is bigger than any of the test instances.  It is sized to handle about two terabytes of data and is probably 13 on the way to that goal.  All of the tablespaces have plenty of space and the rollback segment was recently enlarged by a factor of 3 and is very underutilized.p  pIm not aware of a hang in autocommit mode and it seems to hang only after a transaction accumulates a good bit of data.  But with the problem so random I cant conclusively say that.p  pThis program worked for months without problem and then this started a couple weeks ago without any change to the software whatsoever.  The clients database has been steadily getting bigger, so thats a change. And I hear the client installed some network monitoring software about that time but I dont have any specifics on that.p  pSometimes JDBC batching is in play, other times not and it still fails.p  pIm pulling my hair out over this one, something I have so little of to work withp  pAny insight from my friends at stackoverflowp  pHere is a callstack where I waited to see Seconds in Wait at the server and then paused my client program in the eclipse debugger.

Apparently the problem is caused by network errors.  I wrote a small test program with straightjdbc calls and it fails too.  It only fails against this specific database instance.  The test program binds increasingly long strings into a prepared statement it keeps executing and ultimately rolls back is transaction if it gets that far.  The test program, rather than hang, sometimes throws an exception randomly as followsp  precodejava.sql.SQLException ORA01461 can bind a LONG value only for insert into a LONG column at oracle.jdbc.driver.T4CTTIoer.processErrorT4CTTIoer.java447 at oracle.jdbc.driver.T4CTTIoer.processErrorT4CTTIoer.java396 at oracle.jdbc.driver.T4C8Oall.processErrorT4C8Oall.java951 at oracle.jdbc.driver.T4CTTIfun.receiveT4CTTIfun.java513 at oracle.jdbc.driver.T4CTTIfun.doRPCT4CTTIfun.java227 at oracle.jdbc.driver.T4C8Oall.doOALLT4C8Oall.java531 at oracle.jdbc.driver.T4CPreparedStatement.doOall8T4CPreparedStatement.java208 at oracle.jdbc.driver.T4CPreparedStatement.executeForRowsT4CPreparedStatement.java1046 at oracle.jdbc.driver.OracleStatement.doExecuteWithTimeoutOracleStatement.java1336 at oracle.jdbc.driver.OraclePreparedStatement.executeInternalOraclePreparedStatement.java3613 at oracle.jdbc.driver.OraclePreparedStatement.executeUpdateOraclePreparedStatement.java3694 at oracle.jdbc.driver.OraclePreparedStatementWrapper.executeUpdateOraclePreparedStatementWrapper.java1354 at com.byers.test.outage.TestPreparedInsert.insertThenRollbackTestPreparedInsert.java81 at com.byers.test.outage.TestPreparedInsert.runTestTestPreparedInsert.java54 at com.byers.test.outage.TestPreparedInsert.mainTestPreparedInsert.java28 codepre  pThe test program inserts thousands of rows and runs at a pretty good clip till the insert strings get longer than about 1,300 bytes.  Then it gets increasingly slow and by the time the strings are around 1,500 bytes a single insert will take 30 seconds or more.  I suspect the problems start when the request exceeds a packet in size.p  pI ran WireShark and captured all IP packets going between me and the Oracle server.  Then I see lots of TCP ACKed unseen segment, TCP Previous Segment not captured, TCP Dup ACK 31, TCP Dup ACK 32, etc.  Im no network expert but Im smart enough to say this is not good.p  pUnlike my production system, my test program does not actually cause Oracle to hang so far.  The Oracle session does not show Seconds In Wait and if I wait long enough the program continues even though my patience with that has been limited.  Ive also not seen the above exception thrown unless I run more than one instance of the program at the same time, although that too may be a matter of not waiting long enoughp  pInvocations of the below code such asp  precodeinsertThenRollbackcon, 50, 2000, 0 codepre  pare pretty good at producing the errors.

Would you all agree  Is it not also true that the client should be able to monitor their network somehow for these kinds of errors  It seems almost silly to me that we would invest hundreds of hours of collective effort chasing a problem like this just to find out it is hardware or some kind of invasive software.  Are there ways to detect a high degree of these kinds of network errors by monitoring of some kindp

Also, I am using Apache FTPClient common.p  precodeMessageDigest digest  MessageDigest.getInstanceMD5          FileInputStream is  new FileInputStreamFTPlistFiles[i] ERROR HERE                                                                        FTPfiles is a FTPFile from FTPClient apache commons.         byte[] buffer  new byte[8192]         int read  0         try              while read  is.readbuffer gt 0                  digest.updatebuffer, 0, read                          byte[] md5sum  digest.digest             BigInteger bigInt  new BigInteger1, md5sum             String output  bigInt.toString16             System.out.printlnMD5 n  output                  catchIOException e              throw new RuntimeExceptionUnable to process file for MD5, e          finally              try                  is.close                          catchIOException e                  throw new RuntimeExceptionUnable to close input stream for MD5 calculation, e                       codepre  pNB If impossible, do you know any equivilant to md5 but can do the samep
Negative 997 pThe title says it all really. I am looking for a rails gem to search by hashtags and reply to posts by tagging users with an  sign just like how Twitter does it. I do not want these to go to Twitter or pull from Twitter. I want them to be able to only use hashtags with certain words. I was going to use ActsAsTaggableOn, but it looks like you tag others with skills and other types of tagging. Can this gem actually do the things I am needing and if so where would I find out that information. I went over the Rails Cast and readme and it doesnt seem like it works that way. Thanks for your help.p

Negative 997 pTheres a lot of info out there for a newbie like myself when it comes to webservices, I acknowledge that. However, most of the Google results Ive seen tend to be focusing on a specific format or strategy, and all of them different to each other. As a newbie, I am looking to get more of an overview of the various options open to me, their pros amp cons... before I start committing to a specific one.p  pFor example, I have an existing webservice created from a SQL Server source via ASP.net and this by default comes out as a DiffGram. So there are articles that tell me how to parse the diffgram data coming into my Android app, but I still do not know if the diffgram is the best option I should be using in the first place. Should I, for example be changing my webservice to output JSON p  pDoes anyone know of a 101 level tutorial or explanation out there p  pMany Thanksp
Negative 997 pI have mutiple forms that are used to insert information into a mysql database. That all works fine.p  pI now want to be able to fill a form using the info from the database by selecting something in a selectbox.p  pWhat I dont want to do is code a page for each table. I would like to have the form created dynamically depending on what is selected in the selectbox. Is this possible Can PHP examine what tables I have and then create a form and populate that form from the relevant table based on what is selected in the selectboxp  pAt the moment I am using old mysql and not mysqli or PDO. I will have to get someone else to update the code to mysqli or PDO as I have no idea about that. So for now, I just need to get the basics up and running and then I can hand it over to somebody to correct the outdated mysql code. So if you could please help me based on mysql and not mysqli or PDOp

Negative 997 pI am developing a photo booth application that uses 3 modules to provide printing, capturing, and triggering functionality. The idea is that people can develop modules for it that extend this functionality. These modules are implemented as shared libraries that are loaded at runtime when the user clicks start.p  pI am trying to implement a printer module that prints to a facebook image gallery. I want to use libcurl for this. My problem is with the initialization function codecurlglobalinitcode The libcurl API documentation states that this function is absolutely not thread safe. From a hrefhttpcurl.haxx.selibcurlccurlglobalinit.html relnofollowthe docsap  blockquote   pstrongThis function is not thread safe.strong You must not call it when any other thread in the program i.e. a thread sharing the same memory is running. This doesnt just mean no other thread that is using libcurl. Because curlglobalinit calls functions of other libraries that are similarly thread unsafe, it could conflict with any other thread that uses these other libraries.p blockquote  pa hrefhttpcurl.haxx.selibcurlclibcurl.html relnofollowElsewherea in the documentation it saysp  blockquote   pThe global constant situation merits special consideration when the code you are writing to use libcurl is not the main program, but rather a modular piece of a program, e.g. another library. As a module, your code doesnt know about other parts of the program  it doesnt know whether they use libcurl or not. And its code doesnt necessarily run at the start and end of the whole program.p      pA module like this must have global constant functions of its own, just like curlglobalinit and curlglobalcleanup. The module thus has control at the beginning and end of the program and has a place to call the libcurl functions.p blockquote  p...which seems to address the issue. However, this seems to imply that my modules codeinitcode and codefinalizecode functions would be called at the programs beginning and end. Since the modules are designed to be swappable at runtime, there is no way I can do this. Even if I could, my application uses GLib, which per their a hrefhttpsdeveloper.gnome.orgglib2.37glibThreads.html relnofollowdocumentationa, it is never safe to assume there are no threads runningp  blockquote   p...Since version 2.32, the GLib threading system is automatically initialized at the start of your program, and all threadcreation functions and synchronization primitives are available right away.p      pNote that it is not safe to assume that your program has no threads even if you dont call gthreadnew yourself. GLib and GIO can and will create threads for their own purposes...p blockquote  pMy question is is there any way to safely call codecurlglobalinitcode in my application Can I put the calls to codecurlglobalinitcode and codecurlglobalcleanupcode in my modules codeinitcode and codefinalizecode functions Do I need to find another HTTP libraryp

Negative 997 pI have a Python script which uses the pyodbc module to connect to SQL Express 2008. It selects the records in a SQL Server table over 600,000 rows and updates a column in that table using a complicated REGEX based function parseAddress to extract an address value from two table fields. p  pWhen I test this on a TEMP table created from a subset of the data it works fairly fast 10,000 rows in 133.8 seconds 74 per second but on the 600,000 row table it slows down considerably. Interestingly, if I pull the 600,000 records into ArcGIS, export them to a filegeodatabase and run the parseAddress as a field calculator, it completes extremely quickly. I was trying to avoid the extra processing in Arc if possible, hoping that it would be faster on the database.p  pPythons memory usage goes from 11MB 10,000 rows to about 145MB when loading the larger table I have 8GB of RAM and doesnt get any higher. I am using fetchall and iterating through the result as I was having some trouble getting it to iterate otherwise  I kept getting an error that the Previous SQL Query was not a query when attempting to apply the SQL update using dbCursor, and uCursor was locked from updating while dbCursor was live. I am also unable to access named columns, eg row.ProvID fails, so there might be an issue with my install, I grabbed the latest pyodbc version 3.0.7 today though.p  pI tried the list approach in a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions9402033pythonisslowwheniteratingoveralargelistPython is slow when iterating over a large lista of coderows  listdbCursor.executesqlSelect.fetchallcode , which was 10 faster on my test table, but seems to have a minimal effect on the big table processing.p  pWhat can I do to speed this up emupdate I let it run  667041 records updated in 102296.9 seconds 6.5 per secondemp  pAlternatively, if there is some way I could write this in SQL directly I would love to know.

Negative 997 pwe currently run our Production database on Postgres on an EC2 instance. Wed like to migrate RDS now, but Im unable to get the data into an RDS instance in a timely manner. Using pgdump to get the data out, it takes me 20 minutes to create a dump file, but nearly 18 hours to psql restore it into my RDS instance. And during those 18 hours, my Production database has added some more data that needs to be migrated over. While I can deal with SOME downtime upto an hour, I cant have Production down for 18 hours Is there a better way to do this Say, do the restore offline and then bring the restored RDS instance into a MasterSlave combination with my current database server Or, do a snapshot of my current database volume[my current database version is 9.0.4] and just mount that on the RDS instance strongNOTEstrong Amazon RDS PostgreSQL Server does not allow direct host access to a DB instance via Telnet or Secure Shell SSH p

Problem i can select files but not folders for the list of items to be in the installer. p  pQuestion how do i include the folder in the install package so there doesnt need to be a few more additional steps for the installation. p  pi have thought about zipping it, but there isnt a way that i know of to add a extract command after the initial install extract.  p  pi figure installers are to programs what instruction booklets are to Ikea furniture so i figured this would be the best place for help. tyvmp

Negative 997 pI am new with Selenium strongWebdriverstrong and trying to create my first test cases for application that is constructed mostly with strongPHPstrong. I am creating test cases with Java.p  pMy first test case is testing login into the system. When I run my test, browser instance is started, login information is set into login form fields and login form is submitted. After that browser dericets to used users start page as it should. So the test works as it should.p  pThe problem is, I would like to check if the login was successful and save it in a testing report without a need for me to see the process trough in person. I figured most valid way to ensure login success is to see if strongPHPstrong code have created variable codeSESSION[loggedin]  truecode as it does when login process is successful. Is there any way for me to seek through codeSESSIONcode variables with Java in my Selenium strongWebdriverstrong test classp

It works wonderfully with one animation, but Im trying to chain two animations together.

For my ValueConverterp  precodepublic class MyImageValueConverter  MvxValueConverterltMyMap, stringgt       protected override string ConvertMyMap value, Type targetType, object parameter, System.Globalization.CultureInfo culture              return GetResourcePathvalue           private string GetResourcePathMyMap map                 string path            switch map                      case MyMap.Map1                 path  map1.png                 break             case MyMap.Map2                 path  map2.png                 break             default                 throw new Exceptionno image for map   map.ToString                   return path       codepre  pIn my view, i bind it up like thisp  precode... var map  FindViewByIdltMvxImageViewgtResource.Id.myimageview set.Bindmap.ForAssetImagePath.Tovm gt vm.CurrentMap.WithConversionMyImage ... codepre  pNow to my question. I would very much prefer to set the image from a resource drawable instead, but i have not found a way to do this. I feel like i should just be able to return a resource ID from my converter, and bind it to some property which.p  pAlternatively i could just create a new class that inherits from MvxImageView and add a property that i could do a oneway binding to, that calls SetImageResource. Or even go the full custom binding way. None of these seem very nice.p

Negative 997 pI have been going through a SpriteKit tutorial that makes a Flappy Bird Style Game.  One of the issues I am having, is that it is firing off the code for collision detection incorrectly.  p  pSometimes, this goes perfect...it hits the ground, it fires the method for when it collides with the ground.  However, at seemingly random times, it will hit the ground, and fire off the method for ground collisions anywhere from 26 times.

I can sit and let it drop immediately, and sometimes I get the collision code correctly ran once, other times it runs several times.  Is there something wrong in this code causing it to do thatp  pUPDATE  It seems to be where the two objects meet on multiple intersecting points.

I would like to do something like this p  precode    public void DoSomethingApi              CustomerRepository customerRepository  new CustomerRepository         Customer customer  customerRepository.GetCustomermyId         customer.DoSomething      codepre  pto make my customer entity have more behavior I have tried the followingp  precodepublic class Customer      public void DoSomething               how do I do this          I need a repository and a bunch of services todo work here               using double dispatch     public void DoSomething1DoSomethingService service              service.DoSomething            using domain services directly      public void DoSomething2              new DoSomethingService.DoSomething            using event broker and domain events     public void DoSomething3              EventBroker.FireEventltDoSomethingEventgt            using Actions     public Action DoSomethingAction4  get set   codepre  pAll methods have pros and cons, but I liked the use of domain events the most. However how do you return a value with domain events how do you handle rollbacks if the method is in a transactionp  por maybe domain events is really just for notification fire and forget... p
Negative 997 pIm looking for a technique which allows me to reorder QFrames in a verticalhorizontal box layout by dragging.p  pClarification  Lets suppose p  ul liI have a QMainWindow, with an empty central widget, with the latter having a horizontal box layoutli liI have three menu items, each of which, if triggered, adds a QFrame to the centralwidgets layoutli liI had started my application, and used the actions to add frames in the following order QFrame2, QFrame3, QFrame1li liI would like to grab QFrame1 with my mouse, and put it before the other two, and have the QFrames in the order QFrame1, QFrame2, QFrame3li ul  pI would also like to have some GUI feedback that the QFrame is moveable, like some dots on its side.p  pI have a strong feeling that functionality like this should exist outofthebox, however, I couldnt find it.p  pEditp  pI dont insist on using QFrames  any container would be fine in which I can throw in usual GUI components... For example, QDockWidget has some of the functionality I described is draggable, highlights placing options, and animates the rearrangement of widgets, however, its not that general, like it has position restrictions compared to centralwidget bottom, top, left, right, and I do not need the detachclose button.p

Negative 997 pI have an out of process COM Server that exposes a method I do not want called by code I do not trust. p  pBasically what Im trying to do is prevent a clever customer calling these methods that I need access too. I respect that a different solution all together should be considered. But for reasons I rather not get into I dont really have that option.  I can go with a less than robust solution, but would prefer to get as robust as possible.p  pI have the ability to change both the client and the server code. The server is written in C and the client is written in C. p  pWhats the best way to secure these calls p  pI figured that such a problem would not be uncommon for interprocess communications or remote procedure calls. So Im hoping there is an acceptable industry best practice, or maybe even a straight forward COM solution. In the absence of such, Im leaning towards grabbing underlining data from the arguments and using pieces of that data as a string to encrypt using a key from another piece of the data and pass that to the server to be validated. p

Negative 997 pIm creating a REST service using CMVCWebAPI that will allow access to a file server. The two main operations will be uploading a file or downloading a file. I need to expose the service to mobile devices Android and Apple and web browsers on Window and Apple.p  pI cant seem to find any good guidelines or best practices on how functionality like this should be designed. Ive only built REST services before that have used JSON for data being passed in or being returned. I see examples for C but then theyre consumed by C client code. I feel like with files being involved platform specifics start being important, but I cant find any information that backs that up. Maybe Im overthinking it.p  pWhat Im looking for is advice or links to information that outline standards for uploading and downloading files over rest. For example, as long as you accept a file in the POST call for upload, is that enough leave it up to the client to figure out how to post that file How much metadata should I upload with the file, if any Is the best way to download a file via a GET call to have the call return a url to the file Are there any other gotchas I should be aware ofp

Negative 997 pIll probably receive some flack about this being a generic question, but Im gonna give it a shot because I dont know where else to turn to. Im attempting for the first time to work with Windows Phone 7 API and develop an app for my university. Im versed in VB.NET but never formally C  though it seems pretty straightforward. My main issue is that Ive only really dabbled in simple GUI formdevelopment for desktop applications, and the task Im trying right now involves interfacing with my schools class management website. This website requires authentication, which Im pretty sure is a forms authentication and not just basic authentication am I understanding this right I can post any of the source for the website credential information if its helpful. p  pAnyway, from what I understand Ive been using the HttpWebRequest and WebResponse methods in order to send POST data with my credentials to the site and try to get a response. Im...mildly successful I think When I execute a HttpWebResponse status description I get an OK value back. I have no idea if that means anything good, but it didnt blow up, so thats something. Also, I think the site requires cookies to use and request data from, and Im not sure how to implement a cookieaware webclient in addition to just using the WebRequest and Response methods. I apologize that this is all really broad, but I humbly request that if somebody could point me to a good learning resource for interfacing with websites like this, I would greatly appreciate it. I used Channel 9s Absolute Beginner videos for understanding much of the background, but I feel like theres a large gap between where Im at and being a competent developer and I dont know short of 4 years of additional schooling how best to fill it.

Negative 997 pIve been experiementing with the what i understand to be the module pattern or revealing module pattern in Javascript. At the moment my main objective has been code organisation and cleaning up the global space in my projects but Im sure there are a number of other benefits as well.p  pThe basic pattern Ive been following looks mostly like this p  precodevar myThing  functionw,        var priv            ... private methods          var public            ... public methods           return public  window, jQuery codepre  pThe main benefit of this that I can see is cleaner code and a better structure, by concealing the objs internal methods and properties. Are there other benefits that are glaringly obvious that Im not seeing Im really wondering when and when not to use this pattern.p  pstrongIssue 1 strong So one of the things I like is being able to pass in the w and  as shorthand references to window and jQuery, but when Ive tried to add another library to this it doesnt seem to work specifically velocity.js.p  pEDIT  because Ive included jQuery, velocity attaches its self to the global jQuery obj, the import is for globals which velocity is not, thus I cant import it the same way.p  pstrongIssue 2 strong Secondly Ive read somewhere that its possible to make this pattern work regardless of load order, is that true and if so how should it be modifiedp  pstrongNB strong Critically, Im trying to understand this pattern and whats possible with it rather than substitutions such as implementing require or borwserify.p
Negative 997 pI am using Xcode 6.1 interface builder.  I want to have a universal UILabel font throughout the app in which I can easily change.  For example I want all my UILabel to use font A.otf and later I would like to update all my UILabel to be something else like B.otfp  pMy first attempt is to subclass UILabellets call it MyCustomUILabel and set its font attribute to whatever font I want. With this solution, I just have to make sure I set the UILabel to MyCustomUILabel in the identity inspector. And if I do need to change the font for all MyCustomUILabel, I will need to change it within the MyCustomUILabel class.p  pMy second attempt is to use Xcodes built in custom font helperattribute inspector  font icon  custom  select my font. I was thinking if Xcode already provided a way to custom a font of my UILabel, then why create a custom classp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.com1WXd4.png altenter image description herep  pUsing the Xcode built in custom way, I have a UILabel using GoodProBook.otf as the custom font right now. I wanted to update this UILabels font to Sanitarium.otf and I was hoping that all I have to do is just rename my Sanitarium.otf to GoodProBook.otf and replace the one inside Xcode with this new one.p  pOf course it didnt work out. So, I would like to ask, is this possible in Xcode Am I missing anythingp  pthanks, any suggestions and opinions are appreciated.p

Negative 997 pI am trying to round decimal number upto two decimal places which is working perfectly. I am doing as below p  precodeMath.RoundAmount, 2 codepre  pSo, if I have Amount as code40000.4567code, I am getting code40000.46codewhich is exactly what I want. Now problem is I have decimal number like code40000.0000code, when I round it, the result is code40000code, and what I really want is code40000.00code. So round will always neglect trailing zeros.p  pTo solve this problem, I have the option of converting it to string and use format , but I dont want to do that as that will be inefficient and I believe there must be some way to do it better.p  pI also tried something like p  precodeDecimal.RoundAmount, 2 codepre  pNow one way can be to check whether number contains anything in fractional part and use round function accordingly , but that is really bad way to do it. I cant use truncate as well due to obvious reasons of this being related to amount.p  pWhat is the way aroundp

Negative 997 pThere is a lot of information about Apache Camel  CXFEndpoint and RPCencoded legacy webservices. But until now I did not find a solution for the problem.p  pI want to call an RPCencoded webservice from Apache Camel over the CXF endpoint. CXF does not support RPCencoded Webservices.  So I tried two approaches to solve the problem.p  ol lipConvert wsdl from RPCencoded to RPCliteral and generate source files.  Call the webservice in RPCliteral style which is supported by CXF.

Negative 997 pI ran across a challenge today. What I want to do is an automatic achievement system for my website. I want to check daily if users meet the requirements to get new achievements. Those requirements would not be stocked in the database, to add new achievements, I want to be able to only define a new javascript objectprototype, something along those lines.p  pI am working with sails and I dont know if my approach is right. I am making a service with a method checkForAchievements and I want it to check for all users and if they meet the requirements for every achievement defined. If they do, I would add a record in my table userachievement. Here is what I tried so far  p  precodeexports.checkForAchievements  functioncallback     var AchievementsValidator  functionachievement, user      this.achievement  achievement     this.user  user     this.validation  function        return true          this.giveAchievement  function        UserAchievement.findOrCreate user this.user, achievement this.achievement,  user  this.user, achievement this.achievement        .execfunctionerr, userAchievment           Example badge code, validation returns true if the user has at least 50 posts on the website   var FiftyPosts  function      this.validation  function        Post.count user this.user .execfunctionerr, count          if count gt 50            return true                  else            return false                            Loop in users and execute this code for each    FiftyPosts.prototype  new AchievementsValidator22, user  22 would be the achivement in database   if FiftyPosts.validation      FiftyPosts.giveAchievement      callback   codepre  pIs it possible to get somewhere with this code I feel like it would messy because I would need to write down each achivement in my final loop. Also, the code above is not working properly I cant get the validation to execute on the badge.p  pNote Performance is not an issue as this code will not run often. I only want this to be scalable, so that I can add new achievements without too much hassle. Thank you.p  pstrongEDITstrong It seems like the questions werent clear enough so here you go p  ol lipHow can I get FiftyPosts.validation to use the right method in the above code It is not using any of the above AchievementsValidator, FiftyPosts.pli lipIf you know sails.js enough can you tell me if doing this in a service is a good ideapli ol

Negative 997 pMy team at work manages a few thousand compute hosts for several thousand users.  We have a system in place that allows users to open a terminal somewhere in the farm, and keeping the workload level is an important part of it.  We depend on being able to to process accounting for each terminal process that is started.p  pIts common for users to ask for xterm, dtterm, and gnometerminal processes.  gnometerminal presents a unique challenge for us.  When you start a new gnometerminal process, if you already have an old gnometerminal process running in the same user session on the same machine, the new process passes the shell command on to the old process, and the shellwindow are created as part of the old process tree and the new process exits.  This causes us to have problems with our process accounting, for obvious reasons.p  pThis default behavior of gnometerminal can be stopped by giving the disablefactory option.  But theres no way we can train all our users 8000 to remember to use this option every time they ask for a gnometerminal process in the farm.  We need to find a way to lock this down so that gnometerminal emalwaysem behaves as if the disablefactory option is given.p  pIs there a way to configure this for all users, sitewide  Wed prefer not to wrap gnometerminal with a script to inject the option at invocation time, if possible that would work, but its difficult to maintain, and it could be brittle.  Adding a key in some etcgconf file would be ideal, but Im not sure what if any key would be honored by gnometerminal...p  pAny advice would be appreciated Thanksp

This is not good because I want only one sound to play at a time.p  pI realized that Id have to use a MediaPlayer Singleton to solve my problem. The only problem is that I cant find many sources or examples of the MediaPlayer Singleton online.p  pHeres what I originally put into every onCreateView in each fragmentp  precodepublic static class FragmentPage1 extends Fragment       int selectedSoundId      Override     public View onCreateViewLayoutInflater inflater, ViewGroup container,                              Bundle savedInstanceState          View rootView  inflater.inflateR.layout.fragmentpage1, container, false           final MediaPlayer player  new MediaPlayer         final Resources res  getResources          final int[] buttonIds   R.id.btn1, R.id.btn2, R.id.btn3, R.id.btn4, R.id.btn5, R.id.btn6, R.id.btn7, R.id.btn8, R.id.btn9          final int[] soundIds   R.raw.sound01, R.raw.sound02, R.raw.sound03, R.raw.sound04, R.raw.sound05, R.raw.sound06, R.raw.sound07, R.raw.sound08, R.raw.sound09           View.OnClickListener listener  new View.OnClickListener              Override             public void onClickView v                  for int i  0 i lt buttonIds.length i                      if v.getId  buttonIds[i]                          selectedSoundId  soundIds[i]                         AssetFileDescriptor afd  res.openRawResourceFdsoundIds[i]                         player.reset                         try                              player.setDataSourceafd.getFileDescriptor, afd.getStartOffset, afd.getLength                          catch IllegalArgumentException e                              e.printStackTrace                          catch IllegalStateException e                              e.printStackTrace                          catch IOException e                              e.printStackTrace                                                  try                              player.prepare                          catch IllegalStateException e                              e.printStackTrace                          catch IOException e                              e.printStackTrace                                                  player.start                         break                                                                      for int i  0 i lt buttonIds.length i              ImageButton soundButton  ImageButton rootView.findViewByIdbuttonIds[i]             registerForContextMenusoundButton             soundButton.setOnClickListenerlistener                  return rootView       codepre  pTo my knowledge Id probably put the onClickListener inside of each fragment and the MediaPlayer Singleton in a new Java class.

To improve the experience, the email or phone number is shown to the user so they can see whether they entered it correctly. though rarely, it does happenp  pIm also not sure if the user should be given the opportunity to use another form of validation.p  pThe one problem with the setup on the server side is storing the form information between page requests.p  pCurrently Im using the flashonetime sessions to store the email or the phone number. Once the user submits the form the session is lost. p  pI dont like using sessions for forms, because any time you have more than one window open not that they should be in this case the data can start to become unpredictablep  pI also dont want to use the url params for storing information, as this can have sensitive information being passed back and forth, and stored in browser history.p  pI was thinking I could do ajax, which I try not to use on sites facing a broad audience where someone is bound to be using an old version of IE.p  pThe data I get from the form is stored in the database. I could use the GET method to store an id in params. If I use the id or a random unique id I run the risk of anyone guessing these ids and having access to other website users email address and phone numbers.p  pI could also use a combination of the flash and hidden inputs with the unique id, but the danger of showing personal information is still there.p    pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.com4bBP6.png altmockupp

Negative 997 pI am trying to implement lock by which I want to avoid reads from happening whenever I am doing a write.p  pMy requirements arep  ul liReads block until all two maps have been set for the first time.li liNow second time, If I am updating the maps, I can still return all the two old maps valuebefore the updates are done on all two maps or it should block and return me all the new two maps value whenever the updates are done on all the two maps.li ul  pAs I have two Maps  codeprimaryMappingcode , codesecondaryMappingcode so it should return either all the new values of two updated maps or it should return all the old values of the map. Basically, while updating I dont want to return codeprimaryMappingcode having old values, codesecondaryMappingcode having having new values. It should be consistent, either it should return old values or it should return new values after updating the maps. In my case, updating of maps will happen once in 7 or 8 months very rarely. I am using Countdown Latch for this and it is working fine so far without any issues.p  pNow I have two flows as shown below For each flow, I have a URL from where we get the data for above two maps. In general, I will have two maps for both the flow so we will have different values for those two maps for PROCESS flow as compared to DEVICE flow.p  precodepublic enum FlowType      PROCESS, DEVICE  codepre  pI have a background thread running every 5 minutes which gets the data from each FLOW url and populate those two maps whenever there is an update. When the application is started for the first time, then it will update the mapping and after that, it will update the mapping 78 months afterwards. And it doesnt mean that both the flow mapping will change at the same time. It might be possible PROCESS mapping has change but not DEVICE mapping.p  precodepublic class DataScheduler       private RestTemplate restTemplate  new RestTemplate     private static final String PROCESSURL  httpprocessflowurl     private static final String DEVICEURL  httpdeviceflowurl     private final ScheduledExecutorService scheduler  Executors.newScheduledThreadPool1      public void startScheduleTask          scheduler.scheduleAtFixedRatenew Runnable              public void run                  try                      callService                  catch Exception ex                       logging exception here using logger                                       , 0, 5, TimeUnit.MINUTES           public void callService throws Exception          String url  null         MapltFlowType, Stringgt holder  new HashMapltFlowType, Stringgt         for FlowType flow  FlowType.values              try                  url  getURLflow                 String response  restTemplate.getForObjecturl, String.class                 holder.putflow, response              catch RestClientException ex                   logging exception here using logger                                     parseResponseholder           private void parseResponseMapltFlowType, Stringgt responses throws Exception          MapltFlowType, Mappinggt partitionMapper  new HashMapltFlowType, Mappinggt         boolean update  false          for Map.EntryltFlowType, Stringgt responseEntry  responses.entrySet              FlowType flow  responseEntry.getKey             String response  responseEntry.getValue              MapltString, MapltInteger, Integergtgt primaryMapping  new HashMapltgt             MapltString, MapltInteger, Integergtgt secondaryMapping  new HashMapltgt              if DataUtils.isEmptyresponse                  try Scanner scanner  new Scannerresponse                      boolean hasProcess  Boolean.parseBooleanscanner.nextLine.trim.substringHASPROCESSLEN                     if hasProcess                          update  true                           some code                             partitionMapper.putflow, PartitionHolder.createMapping                                             primaryMapping, secondaryMapping                                                                      if there is any update, then only update the mappings, otherwise not.         if update              PartitionHolder.setMappingspartitionMapper                codepre  pAs you can see above, it updates the mapping by calling codesetMappingscode method if any of the flow mapping has been updated. p  pAnd below is my PartitionHolder classp  precodepublic class PartitionHolder       public static class Mapping          public final MapltString, MapltInteger, Integergtgt primaryMapping         public final MapltString, MapltInteger, Integergtgt secondaryMapping          public MappingMapltString, MapltInteger, Integergtgt primaryMapping,                 MapltString, MapltInteger, Integergtgt secondaryMapping              this.primaryMapping  primaryMapping             this.secondaryMapping  secondaryMapping                    getters here           private static final AtomicReferenceltMapltFlowType, Mappinggtgt mappingsHolder  new AtomicReferenceltMapltFlowType, Mappinggtgt     private static final CountDownLatch hasInitialized  new CountDownLatch1      public static Mapping getFlowMappingFlowType flowType          try              hasInitialized.await             return mappingsHolder.get.getflowType          catch InterruptedException e              Thread.currentThread.interrupt             throw new IllegalStateExceptione                    public static void setMappingsMapltFlowType, Mappinggt newMapData          mappingsHolder.setnewMapData         hasInitialized.countDown           public static Mapping createMapping             MapltString, MapltInteger, Integergtgt primaryMapping,             MapltString, MapltInteger, Integergtgt secondaryMapping          return new MappingprimaryMapping, secondaryMapping       codepre  pNow this is the way I am using codePartitionHoldercode class from the main thread.

In below code codedataKey.getFlowTypecode can be PROCESS OR DEVICE.p  precodeOverride public DataResponse call throws Exception      Mapping mappings  PartitionHolder.getFlowMappingdataKey.getFlowType      use mappings object here  codepre  pNow in my above code as you can see, I am updating the mapping by calling codesetMappingscode method if any of the flow mapping has been updated. There are two scenarios which can happenp  ul liWhen the application is started for the first time, then it works fine without any issues, since it will update the mapping for both the flow. li liNow second time, lets say for PROCESS flow, mapping has been updated but for DEVICE flow mapping has not been updated, then in that case it will update the overall mapping by calling codesetMappingscode method which will overwrite codemappingsHoldercode. Problem with this approach is, for DEVICE flow I will start getting empty mapping when I will call codegetFlowMappingcode since it overwrote DEVICE mapping to empty  maps. Rightli ul  pHow can I avoid my second problem Is there any better way to solve this problem instead of using Map and key as the FlowType Do I need to use Factory pattern here to solve this problem or any other better wayp
Negative 997 pI have a step in my job with an ItemReaderItemProcessorItemWriter. In my ItemWriter, I need to increment a variable for each record in order to know which is the line number of my record in the file. For now, Im using a static variable which works well for what I want to do, when Im processing a single file. Problem is  I can restart my job with different parameters, and when Im processing another file without restarting my app before, my variable doesnt restart to the initial number while its static, and I can have my counter set to 33 instead of 1...p  pI guess I could work around this problem using the stepContext instead of using a static variable, but I dont like this way. Id prefer to have a method called when all records have been processed something like the FlatFileItemWriters footerCallback, so that I could reset my static variable. Id just like to avoid the stepContext way, actually.p  pIs there a method like this for a classic ItemWriter not the predefined one for flat files  Or another way to do this p

Negative 997 pIve been reading through the sun.misc.Unsafe class openjdk6 as I was curious how many native methods it actually referred to. Understandably there are a large number of native methods in the class, however I cannot seem to find where they are implemented.p  pIve grepd through the openjdk6 repo and, while I can find implementations of other classs native methods, I cannot find Unsafes.

Negative 997 pI am developing a strongstatelessstrong Agent in strongJavastrong that takes informations from one Server and transfer it to another client. It means that the agent is located between a client and a server. So I am thinking to run two threads strongsimultaneouslystrong on the agent one thread thread1 runs a serverSocket and get request from client while another threads thread2is runnning and makes communication with the server. The problem consists in synchronizing between the two threads. I am thinking in making thread 1 asking whole the time thread 2 about a new Information. If thread 2 has nothing new, he will not answer it. What is the best way to synchronize between them. Should I use a global variable a flag to synchronize between them Can I save Information when I have a stateless agentp

Negative 997 pis there no sense in using DataTables as DTOs Currently In my MVC project, Im using my own DAL which its methods return DataTables also there is ViewModel per views. so to present data to View there are these stepsp  ol liDAL returns a DataTable.li lithe result is mapped to a DTO with AutoMapper.li lithe DTO will be mapped to ViewModel with AutoMapper.li ol  pif we omit step 2 and map DataTables directly to ViewModels then we gain less code and perhaps even more performance. so It is practical if we use DataTables instead of DTOs classes Could you tell me what reason do you have for your answerp

Negative 997 pSo I build an Ionic App for both iOs and Android. But my client need a version for the internet as well. My Ionic app already look good on iPad. So for saving time to rebuild an Angular web app, I tend to just turn the Ionic App into a web app. I know Ionic do not support IE9, but my client only care about latest Chrome, Firefox and Safari bowsers maybe with a warning message if users are on IE and ask them to use Chrome instead. But beside this, is there a step by step guide, best practice guide I can follow to turn my Ionic App into Web app Like build conditional statement from Cordova plugin as the likes... My app does user native functionality like inappbrowser and Cordova geo location. But thats it. p  pI know in a long run, I should really build an web app. But for this, I just want a lazy version of the app available on the browsers. p  pAny tips will be greatly appreciated  p

When you hit backnext buttons, both dates will move backwardforwardbr 2. BackNext should use the gap between the two dates to jump aroundbr 3. When the date on the left hits the minimum dates and you hit back, that date wont decrease anymore but the date on the right side will still decrease until it hits the minimum dates as wellbr 4. When both dates equals to each other at the minimum date, when you hit Next, the date on the right side will increase by 7 a week by default.br 5. Vice versa for the right side. p
