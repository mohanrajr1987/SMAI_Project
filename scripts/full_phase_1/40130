Positive 40130 pId like to create a layout that I can animate my items in. So when a dataprovider gets set on my List, the Lists layout will then animate those items onto the screen. p  pSo Ive created a CustomLayout and added an update function.p  pIn the updateDisplayList the items are traced out just fine.p  pBut in the update function where I want to do the animation, the items are tracing out as null even though if I trace layoutTargets numElements I get four If I use a setTimeout after setting the dataProvider in my Main app of a second or two, then call update in the ListLayout, then the traces work fine. So my question is, how can I ensure that I call update to animate the items in when they are actually availablep  pMain appp  precodeltxml version1.0 encodingutf8gt ltsWindowedApplication xmlnsfxhttpns.adobe.commxml2009     xmlnsslibraryns.adobe.comflexspark     xmlnsmxlibraryns.adobe.comflexmx     xmlnscustom     creationCompletehandleCreationCompletegt     ltfxDeclarationsgt         lt Place nonvisual elements e.g., services, value objects here gt     ltfxDeclarationsgt      ltfxScriptgt         lt[CDATA[             import mx.collections.ArrayCollection              [Bindable]             private var dataProviderArrayCollection             public function set dataProvidervalueArrayCollectionvoid                              dataProvider  value                 listLayout.update                           private function handleCreationCompletevoid                              var arrArray  new Array  label1 ,  label2 ,  label3 ,  label4                   dataProvider  new ArrayCollectionarr                      ]]gt     ltfxScriptgt      ltsList idlist         dataProvider dataProvider          labelFieldlabelgt         ltslayoutgt             ltcustomListLayout idlistLayout  gt         ltslayoutgt     ltsListgt ltsWindowedApplicationgt codepre  pListLayoutp  precodepackage      import mx.core.ILayoutElement     import spark.components.supportClasses.GroupBase     import spark.layouts.supportClasses.LayoutBase             ...       author           public class ListLayout extends LayoutBase              public function updatevoid                      var layoutTargetGroupBase  target             layoutTarget.autoLayout  false              var countint  layoutTarget.numElements             tracecount traces 4              for var iint  0 i lt count i                              var itemILayoutElement  useVirtualLayout  layoutTarget.getVirtualElementAti   layoutTarget.getElementAti                 traceitem traces null                                override public function updateDisplayListwidthNumber, heightNumbervoid                      super.updateDisplayListwidth, height              var layoutTargetGroupBase  target              var countint  layoutTarget.numElements              for var iint  0 i lt count i                              var itemILayoutElement  useVirtualLayout  layoutTarget.getVirtualElementAti  layoutTarget.getElementAti                 traceitem traces out the item                             codepre

Positive 40130 pstrongContextstrong Alright, so as part of a project Ive been tasked with creating a tab  NavigatorContent which contains a File Tree that supports dragdrop reorganisation and importing. Copypasting. Essentially asking for the full functionality of a Windows folder, inside a desktop application.p  pI started, logically, with a FileSystemTree from the old MX components, and gave it the directory it needs to reference upon CreationComplete. To support native dragdrop, I added a container below it with prompts to dragdrop content. This successfully copies content into the directory referenced by the FileSystemTree, and refreshes it, displaying the new content. Gold.p  pstrongMy problem starts herestrong Ive enabled dragdrop on the Tree, and sure enough you can dragdrop items around the FileTree and reorganise them into the folderswhatever you want to do. But, because the Tree is only a reference to the directory, and not a direct link, nothing actually happens to the directory when all is said and done.p  pI attempted some lengthy, convoluted effort to catch dragdrop events and use the index of the dropped object to call emmoveToem  functions as files are moved, and refreshing the Tree at each. This emalmostem works, but it has enough issues that its moot. I can share this code if needed, but Im fairly certain its the wrong direction.p  pstrongTLDR Questionstrong Is there any previously establishedeasy way to capture the structure of a FileSystemTree and then use that structure to update an actual directory structurep

Negative 40130 pIs there a way to detect that a DirectShow filtergraph has reached the end of its file  By end of its file, I mean that a filtergraph with a SampleGrabber filter will never receive another SampleCB call.p  pHere are some things that dont workp  ul liTrust codeIMediaDetgetStreamLengthcode its often says there are more frames in a video than really existli liTrust codeIMediaSeekingGetDurationcode its consistent with IMediaDet,  one frameli liUse codeIMediaControlGetStatecode the filtergraph remains running even if all frames have already been processed from a fileli ul  pstrongBackgroundstrongp  pI am doing video processing and I have a class that creates a filtergraph with a SampleGrabber.  Whenever codeSampleGrabberSampleCBcode is called, I block it with a mutex so I can run the filtergraph in pull mode.  When Im ready for another frame, I unblock the mutex in my main thread and wait for codeSampleGrabberSampleCBcode to send me a signal that its done.  For some videos, codeIMediaDetgetStreamLengthcode tells me that the video has more frames than really exist.  Once Ive extracted the final frame and request one more than actually exists, the main thread then blocks forever because codeSampleGrabberSampleCBcode will never get called again.  Id like to be able to detect when codeSampleGrabberSampleCBcode will never be called for file sources.  Applications like Windows Media Player are able to somehow do this because the GUI reports that the video has ended after the last real frame, so apparently theres a way to do this.p  pstrongEDITstrongp  pIm using codeWaitForSingleObjectcode to implement the main thread blocking.  The workaround that Ive been using so far is to do what Greg suggested have a finite timeout.  Unfortunately, this gets a little tricky.  The wait can fail for many reasons such as a true eof, slow network filesystem, lost network connection, slow decoder, etc.p

Negative 40130 pI have a project private, ASP.net website, password protected with https where one of the requirements is that the user be able to enter Sql queries that will directly query the database.

Part of the way that this will be accomplished is that the user will be using a set of table names that do not actually exist in the database, part of the query parsing will be to substitute in the correct corresponding table names into the query.li ol  pAm I missing anything p  pThe goal is that the users be able to queryupdate tables to which they have access in any way that they see fit, and to prevent any accidental or malicious attempts to damage the db.

Negative 40130 pThis pertains to embedding ESRI MapControls into Access Database Forms.p  pI have two access files, split into a frontend and backend.  My backend is also a PersonalGeoDatabase that ArcGIS uses to store a feature class for display on a From embedded ESRI map control.p  pThe feature class stores polylines, points, and polygons which are associated with a specific ProjectID.p  pFrom the frontend, I have the embedded mapControl which loads the MXD file tied to the backend.p  pIve got a VB function called CenterPoint, which coincidentally, centers the map envelope around the Projects associated feature class if it exists and sets the desired viewing extents.  If the feature class for a project doesnt yet exist, it centers the map around the entire region all the projects are contained in, giving a general overview.p  pSo, if that all made sense, and I havent lost you...p  pI originally called the CenterPoint sub in the FormCurrent Event.  This worked, in that it performed all the functionality desired however, while the CenterPoint function ran, the form was unresponsive, preventing changing to another record until the redraw had finished.  This meant, if you wished to jump through 10 records, you would have to jump 1, wait for redraw, jump another, wait for redraw, etc.  I sped up the redraw considerably by optimizing the MXD imagery and layers, but it was still unacceptable.p  pNext, I tried to establish a delay of a few seconds, before it called the CenterPoint sub by running the followingp  precodePrivate Sub FormCurrent     Dim sStart As single     Dim sDelay As single     sStart  Timer     Do While Timer lt sStart  sDelay         DoEvents     Loop  CenterPoint  End Sub codepre  pWhich gives me the desired responsiveness by using the DoEvents call, meaning I can click multiple records before it tries to redraw the first time.p  pUnfortunately, it apparently caches all the FormCurrent calls, and if I skip say, 3 records, wait for the delay to end, and watch the screen, it will redraw ie. run CenterPoint 3 times consecutively.p  pEven more weird, is it sporadically gives me a division by zero error for the linep  precodeDo While Timer lt sStart  sDelay codepre  pdespite having no division in the line.p  pSo, I guess my questions arep  ol liIs there a way to have access only run the formcurrent call once ul liIf not, is there a way to make sure a user has stayed on the current record for a given time before I call the CenterPoint function ul liIs there a way to insulate my lessthan comparison from the division by zero error, so at least, even though it will redraw multiple times, the user can click through records in rapid succession ol  pRight now, my work around has been to put the CenterPoint sub as a click event for a button on the form, which works, but isnt ideal.p  pIf any of this doesnt make sense, or more information is necessary, please let me know.p  pThanks, Spencerp

Negative 40130 pIn linux kernel, codememmapcode is the array which holds all struct page descriptors.

If each entry size is 32 byte, then the codememmapcode memory size  8MiB.

This webservice will accept a customer and the customers accounts along with a couple other related objects and attributes and such. p  pWhen the webservice recieves a request, I attempt to process it.br  If there is no error I simply just return.  If there is an error, I throw it.p  pIm wondering if this is the best approach, or if I should modify my design so that I return a bool as the response, or even create a response object, that maybe contains the original request object plus a status and if error, a list of errors ie Missing Fields, Invalid Fields, ext.  p  pWhich return method would you incorporate in your designbr  1 Just return if no error, Throw error if error 2 bool success 3 Response object containing original request object and detailed resultsp  pThanks for any suggestions.

Negative 40130 pHaving been googling for hours, I realize that users can use either xml fileorm.xml, I suppose or annotations in JPA, or both of them at the same time.

Negative 40130 pIn my SilverLight application, I have a property in my ViewModel called vmProperty and a list called dgSource. p  pI bind my dgSource to the datagrid as ItemsSource at which point each datagrid rows datacontext changes to each item in dgSource. One of the columns, say a checkbox column, needs to bind to vmProperty. But since the ViewModel is no longer the rows datacontext, I cannot get access to this property. p  pHow do I get around this problem If the question is not clear, please let me know and I will post a sample.

Ive had VS opened for both one of the web clients and the web service and can step through the code from the client to the WS and back.  When I can reproduce the issue, I have stepped through the client code to where it calls our web service, then switch to the WS code and step through until it calls the vendors code and at that point, it jumps back to the client code, without hitting the Catch block or any code after it.p  pHope that helps.p  pstrongEDITstrongp  pSome of the posted answers have provided avenues to research, most notibly that there are exceptions that can be created that are not derived from System.Exception.  Who knew  But I also found out that from .NET 2.0 and later, these nonSystem.Exceptions are getting wrapped by .NET in a System.Exception.  So in theory that should rule nonSystem.Exceptions out.p  pAdditionally, from my reading, when calling a web service like my web service is doing theoretically only two types of exceptions should ever really be seen, System.Net.WebException and System.Web.Services.Protocols.SoapException, both of which derive from System.Exception.  I dont know if it is really true if there are only 2 types of exceptions possible when calling a web service, but Ill throw it out there. p  pStill searching for an answer...p  pstrongEDITstrongp  pReproducing the error condition has proved to be elusive.  Every scenario that Ive thrown at the code has responded as expected, with the error being caught in the Catch block.  While in theory .NET is supposed to be wrapping exceptions that do not derive from System.Exception, the only logical answer appears to agree with Joes answer that the exception we have experienced does NOT derive from System.Exception and thus is treated as an unhandled exception.p

Negative 40130 pI am designing a database from scratch from manufacturing products. The key design is as follows Currently I am working on MS Access 2007 but my final implementation is SQL Server i.e. SQL Server 2008 being the latest version. Also I would be using only Express edition at this movement. The application will involve a .NET storefront interfaced with this databasep  p[1].Each product may be divided into various categories. I have decided to assume that if a product does not have a category, I will forcefully insert a category called by the name BLANK, rather than calling it NULL, in this way I can add categories to the product in future if required 1 Product can have many categories. 1 Category can belong to more than 1 products. Categories may also be changed to belong to a different product in future.p  p[2].Each product category may be divided into various subcategories. Again, I have decided to assume that if a product category does not have a subcategory, I will forcefully insert a subcategory called by the name BLANK, rather than calling it NULL, in this way I can add subcategories to a product category in future if required 1 Product Category can have many subcategories. 1 SubCategory can belong to more than 1 product Category. SubCategories may also be changed to belong to a different product category in future.p  p[3].Each product will have different number of attributes. Each attribute will have different attribute values Values of some attributes will be dependent on the values of other attributes Values of some attributes which may not be directly dependent on the value of other attributes will still be indirectly dependent based on the availability of the values of other attributes.p  pThe design I have thereby developed is as followsp  p0000ProductLinebr ProductLineIDPKbr ProductLineNamep  p0001ProductLineCategorybr ProductLineCategoryIDPKbr ProductLineCategoryNamep  p0002ProductLineCategoryAssociationbr [PK]ProductLineIDFK Referring ProductLineID from table 0000ProductLinebr [PK]ProductLineCategoryIDFK Referring ProductLineCategoryID from table 0001ProductLineCategoryp  p0003ProductLineSubCategorybr ProductLineSubCategoryIDPKbr ProductLineSubCategoryNamep  p0004ProductLineCategoryAndSubCategoryAssociationbr [PK]ProductLineCategoryIDFK Referring ProductLineCategoryID from table 0001ProductLineCategorybr [PK]ProductLineSubCategoryIDFK Referring ProductLineSubCategoryID from table 0003ProductLineSubCategoryp  p0005ProductLineAttributesbr AttributeIDPKbr AttributeNamep  p0006ProductLineAttributeValuesbr [PK]AttributeIDFK Referring AttributeID from table 0005ProductLineAttributesbr [PK]AttributeValuesp  p0007ProductLineAttributesAssociationbr [PK]ProductLineSubCategoryIDFK Referring ProductLineSubCategoryID from table 0003ProductLineSubCategorybr [PK]AttributeIDFK Referring AttributeID from table 0005ProductLineAttributesp  pNow the biggest issues I have are how do I manage the attributes for various products finally product subcategories, as I am mapping everything to product subcategories because even if a product has or does not have a category or subcategory I will still forcefully insert a BLANK category and subcategoryp  pSuppose I have the following valuesp  pProduct Linebr Abr Bp  pProduct Line Categoriesbr A A1br A A2br A A3br B B1br B B2brp  pProduct Line Sub Categoriesbr A A1 abr A A1 bbr A A1 cbr A A2 xbr A A2 ybr B B1 mbr B B1 nbr B B2 pbr B B2 qbr B B2 rbrp  pAttributesbr a att1br a att2br a att3br b att2br b att4br c att1br c att3br c att4br x att2br x att3br y att4br y att5br m att3br m att7br n att1br n att7br p att2br p att3br p att5br q att4br q att6br r att1br r att6p  pAttribute Valuesbr att1 Value1br att1 Value2br att1 Value3br att2 Value1br att2 Value2br att2 Value3br att2 Value4br att3 Value1br att3 Value2br att4 Value1br att4 Value2br att4 Value3br att4 Value4br att4 Value5br ......p  pNow For Example att1 and att2 are related So if user selects a Value for att1, it determines what all values of att2 should be made available to the user Similarly if user selects Value for att2, it determines what all values of att3 should be made available to the userp  pThere is no hierarchy that, if att1 and att2 are related, user should select att1 first and att2 next OR viceversa User can select the value for either att1 OR att2 and it should filter down the otherp  pAnother example att2 and att3 and att4 are related So if user selects a Value for att2, it will determine what all values for att3 and att4 should be made available to the user. Similarly if user selects a Value for att3, it will determine what all values for att2 and att4 should be made available to the user. Similarly if user selects a Value for att4, it will determine what all values for att2 and att3 should be made available to the user.p  pHere also, there is no hierarchy that, if att2 and att3 and att4 are related, user should select att2 first and att3 next and att4 next OR viceversa User can select the value for either att2 OR att3 OR att4 and it should filter down the other related attributesp  pHow do I go about establishing relationship between various attributes so that my filter using where clause would work appropriately If they all were columns I could easily use group by, but these are rows.p  pI have done a lot of research on internet and came up with the following options 1. Use one large table for all the products and their attributes. But the size of this table will be immensely huge with innumerable null values in various columns and it doesnt server the purpose as reading using selects would affect performance hugely.p  ol lipUse Sparse columns in SQL Server 2008 to avoid the effects of null values. However even though sparse columns save space for values which are null, they require more than normal storage space for values which are not null. also the table size is still huge with innumerable columns affecting the read performance.pli lipI should use XML for storing data. I am not sure about how I would implement it and what would be the advantages or disadvantages.pli lipI should break it down into separate small tables for each subcategory representing only its own attributes as columns rather than that of the entire product or its category. Then I would pass table name as parameters in my application code. However this will have the issue of SQL injection. The resolution would be to use Stored Procedure with parameterized queries. However the performance would still be affected as the database engine cannot optimize the query plans for such queries where joins are done only to reach a subcategory but after that a tablename is called by a parameter passing the subcategory.pli lipI should write SQL queries to prepare a view of each subcategories representing its own attributes rather than having separate table for each subcategory. However to create views I would need to have relationships stored somewhere because some attributes are dependent on each other directly based on the values and some attributes are dependent on each other indirectly based on the avilability of values. So I will have this table of attribute and values as I have already designed and then I will need a many to many recursive relationship table. But this many to many recursive relationship table will be immensely huge and the number of selfjoins that will take place will drastically affect the performance. Also again the viewname will need to be passed as a parameter to a dynamic sql or parameterized stored procedure.pli lipThe last option I came across was EAV database design which has its own pros and cons including complex query writing as well as monitoring the performance on my own because database engine cannot optimize the query plans for such a database. Also such an EAV database loses most of its relational essence and the constraints on various values are far dificult to enforce which will involve a lot of triggers.pli ol  pI am not sure what would be the best option to design my database. The database would be mostly accessed on SELECT queries through the application. Any insertion for a product or its category or subcategory or its attributes or values will be done by data entry. The direct inserts will be done for registering customer and product vendorsmanufacturers which i am presuming at this moment will be a separate database. Then i would need to develop some kind of mapping to map the vendorsmanufacturers to the products they provide or manufacture Users will be able to filter down to a subcategory, select its attribute values and buy the product online. There is also a need for a filter by filter i mean queries using where clause required where the user will not know what kind of product they want, so they will select the attributes they want to filter down through and it should map to one of the subcategories and finally the user should be able to select the values for the attributes.p  pI am really confused with how do I implement my database and facing lot of challenges being alone in the IT team in a small company.p  pAny help from you all will be greatly appreciated and considered a huge asset.p

Negative 40130 pI first need to apologize for my earlier questions. You can check my profile for themThey seemed to ask more questions than give answers. Hence, I am laying down the actual question that started all them absurd questions.p  pI am trying to design a chat applet. Till now, I have coded the applet, servlet and communication between the applet and the servlet. The code in the servlet side is such that I was able to establish chatting between clients using the applets, but the code was more like a broadcast all feature, i.e. all clients would be chatting with each other. That was my first objective when I started designing the chat applet. The second step is chatting between only two specific users, much like any other chat application we have. So this was my idea for itp  ol liI create an instance of the servlet that has the broadcastall code.li liI then pass the address of this instance to the respective clients.li li2 client applets use the address to then chat. Technically the code is broadcastall, but since only 2 clients are connected to it, it gives the chatting between two clients feature. Thus, groups of 2 clients have different instances of the same servlet, and each instance handles chatting between two clients at a max.li ol  pHowever, as predicted, the idea didnt materializep  pI tried emto create an instance of the servletem but the only solution for that was using sessions on the servlet side, and I dont know how to use this session for later communications.p  blockquote   pI now know how to use the request.getSession. So I set the session for an applet in its param tag and use it for further communications with the servlet. But how do I use this data to establish chatting between two clients As I wrote earlier, I have the code for broadcastall chatting as followsp blockquote  precodepublic class CustomerServlet extends HttpServlet   public String getNextMessage       Create a message sink to wait for a new message from the      message source.     return new MessageSink.getNextMessagesource   Override protected void doGetHttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response throws ServletException, IOException      ObjectOutputStream dout  new ObjectOutputStreamresponse.getOutputStream     String recMSG  getNextMessage     dout.writeObjectrecMSG     dout.flush   public void broadcastMessageString message       Send the message to all the HTTPconnected clients by giving the      message to the message source     source.sendMessagemessage   Override protected void doPostHttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response throws ServletException, IOException      try          ObjectInputStream din new ObjectInputStreamrequest.getInputStream         String message  Stringdin.readObject         ObjectOutputStream dout  new ObjectOutputStreamresponse.getOutputStream         dout.writeObject1         dout.flush         if message  null              broadcastMessagemessage                   Set the status code to indicate there will be no response         response.setStatusresponse.SCNOCONTENT      catch Exception e          e.printStackTrace       MessageSource source  new MessageSource   class MessageSource extends Observable  public void sendMessageString message      setChanged     notifyObserversmessage   class MessageSink implements Observer  String message  null   set by update and read by getNextMessage  Called by the message source when it gets a new message synchronized public void updateObservable o, Object arg       Get the new message     message  Stringarg      Wake up our waiting thread     notify   Gets the next message sent out from the message source synchronized public String getNextMessageMessageSource source       Tell source we want to be told about new messages     source.addObserverthis      Wait until our update method receives a message     while message  null          try              wait          catch Exception e              System.out.printlnException has occured ERR ERR ERR                    Tell source to stop telling us about new messages     source.deleteObserverthis      Now return the message we received      But first set the message instance variable to null      so update and getNextMessage can be called again.     String messageCopy  message     message  null     return messageCopy   codepre  blockquote   pOn the applet side, I have a thread that will connect to the servlet above using GET method to get new messages. It uses a while loop, and blocks until it gets a message from the servlet. The main thread communicates with the servlet using POST method whenever the client has entered the message. Currently all clients chat with everyone. I want to use the same methods used above or if possible any other way to establish chatting between two clients and two clients only. I could possibly have another thread in the  applet to check if any other user wishes to chat with it and then exchange some data so that only those two user chat... p blockquote  pI then tried to modify my broadcastall code. In that code, I was using classes that implemented Observer and Observable interfaces. So the next idea that I got wasp  ol liCreate a new object of the Observable classsay class1. This object be common to 2 clients.li li2 clients that wish to chat will use same object of the class1.li li2 other clients will use a different object of class1.li ol  pBut the problem here lies with the class that implements the Observer interfacesay class2. Since this has observers monitoring the same type of class, namely class1, how do I establish an observer monitoring one object of class1 and another observer monitoring another object of the same class class1 Because notifyObservers would notify all the observers and I cant assign a particular observer to a particular objectp  pI first decided to ask individual problems, like how to create instances of servlets, using objects of observable and observer and so on in stackoverflow... but I got confused even more. Can anyone give me an idea how to establish chatting between two clients onlyI am using Http and not sockets or RMI.p  pRegards, Mithun.p  pstrongP.S.strong Thanks to all who replied to my previous absurd queries. I should have stated the purpose earlier so that you guys could help me better.p

And how can I get the JavaScript files that are concatenated via my Concat.php file run through YUI Compressor Maybe run via the server I have direct access to the server so I could install YUI Compressor there if necessary, but would this be a good idea Surely optimising on the server everytime a page is requested will be slow and bad for the server  increase bandwidth etc.p  pThe reason this has come up is that Im constantly having to go back and make changes to existing compressedminified JSCSS files which is a real pain because I need to grab the original source files, make changes then reminify and upload. When really Id rather just have to edit my files and let the server handle the minification.p  pHope someone can help with this.p

Negative 40130 pIve been through the Android tutorials  these do a good job of introducing how we can handroll an Android userinterface. Actually, I do not need that level of control right now... Im looking for something simpler...p  pId like to make an Android app which will mainly contain a number of standard UI widgets, nothing particularly fancy. Having done some VB development a long time ago yes, I know its crap  I particularly like the ability to paint userinterfaces with an interface designer and then add in the relevant callbacks via the IDE. Im using Eclipse, so for now solutions requiring netbeans or other IDEs are not particularly helpful.p  pIm well aware that this practice often produces suboptimal code, and less than beautiful interfaces. Thats not really a concern here. I just need to produce a certain effect quickly in order to prove a concept. There will be plenty of time later on for optimization if my idea is good enough. p

This container is preinitialized to the first notyetdefined container type. This works out pretty well so far. Adding containers works. Deleting containers works.p  pThe problem is I want to achieve that choosing and adding a container type which is already in the collection should sum up their counts instead it would violate the unique constraint. Im not sure what would be the best way without implementingreinventing the complete codeacceptsnestedattributesforcode magic  actually I wanted to reduce  not increase  code and complexity by using that.p

Negative 40130 pSay that you want to do some fancy formatting of some tabular output from powershell, and the destination is to be html either for a webserver, or to be sent in an email.

CSS on the other hand needs a helping hand. If you wanted a certain cell to be treated specially, then you would need to distinguish it from its siblings with a class, id, or something along those lines.

Negative 40130 pI have a complex Android app with a decent amount of application state that needs to be persisted in a specific format. Writing out the data is not an instantaneous operation and so it would be ideal to minimize persisting it unnecessarily.p  pBecause of the persistence overhead it is not practical to persist the state every time it is changed. Ideally, persisting state would be triggered when the app is backgrounded by the user tapping the home button or tapping the back button on the apps root Activity or by an incoming call, etc.. This minimizes persistence overhead while maintaining state consistency from the users perspective. The question is how can you detect if the app is being backgroundedp  pThe Activity lifecycle calls onStart, onResume, onPause and friends dont help as the app has many different activities, any one of which could be active when the user taps home. Furthermore, the calls get called when Activities get pushed, popped and bottom killed on the Activity stack and so they dont reflect if the app is going away or not.p  pSo how does an app detect when it is going to the backgroundp

Negative 40130 pI am looking for some advice about structuring Delphi programs for maintainability. Ive come to Delphi programming after a couple of decades of mostly CC though I first learned to program with Turbo Pascal, so Im not uncomfortable with the basic language. In my previous experience with C and C, I became a TDD convert through using cxxtest and NUnit.p  pI have inherited this program that I am now responsible for maintaining. It consists mainly of forms, and a couple of data modules. The application business logic and data access is mainly scattered about the forms, and the data modules are mostly just places for global ADO objects to live. The database access is generally done by referring to a global instance of TADOQuery or TADOCommand, formatting SQL text right into the relevant property of the object, and calling its Open or Execute method.p  pI am trying to get the business logic into a degree of encapsulation where it can be unittested. Ive seen a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions549369howiftorefactoradelphiprogramusingonlyformsanddatamodules549649549649this answera and it makes perfect sense as far as abstracting logic from forms. I am wondering what the best practices are for data access. My thinking is that the data modules should expose a sort of appspecific miniAPI probably with all virtual methods so that they can be replaced with mock objects for testing. The link at a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions472944unittestingdelphidatamodules473079473079this other answera shows some examples that lead me to believe Im on the right track, but Im still interested in seeing some kind of best practices document about data modules. Most of the pages that I can find through Google present the same kind of examples about all the cool stuff you can do at design time with hooking up databound controls to queries and that sort of thing, which Im not very interested in at the moment.p

Negative 40130 pI am relatively new to design patterns as they are referred to in a formal sense. Ive not been a professional for very long, so Im pretty new to this.p  pWeve got a pure virtual interface base class. This interface class is obviously to provide the definition of what functionality its derived children are supposed to do. The current use and situation in the software dictates what type of derived child we want to use, so I recommended creating a wrapper that will communicate which type of derived child we want and return a Base pointer that points to a new derived object. This wrapper, to my understanding, is a factory.p  pWell, a colleague of mine created a static function in the Base class to act as the factory. This causes me trouble for two reasons. First, it seems to break the interface nature of the Base class. It feels wrong to me that the interface would itself need to have knowledge of the children derived from it.p  pSecondly, it causes more problems when I try to reuse the Base class across two different Qt projects. One project is where I am implementing the first and probably only real implementation for this one class... though i want to use the same method for two other features that will have several different derived classes derived class and the second is the actual application where my code will eventually be used. My colleague has created a derived class to act as a tester for the real application while I code my part. This means that Ive got to add his headers and cpp files to my project, and that just seems wrong since Im not even using his code for the project while I implement my part but he will use mine when it is finished.p  pAm I correct in thinking that the factory really needs to be a wrapper around the Base class rather than the Base acting as the factoryp

They have a database and front end desktop application.p  pNow I have a website for which I have the SAME database structuremodel as the 10 servers hold on it. I use LINQ to SQL to set up queries for which I will change the connection string for the DataContext before executing the query.p  pSo basically I have the database on my webserver to serve as a shell if you like for which I can create relational queries based on the webserver database and send the updated information back to whichever server I like by changing the connection string of the datacontext.p  pAs mentioned previously the database structure will always be the same across the individual database and the webserver database.

Negative 40130 pI really need you guys to help me out on this and clear up my mind. A little about what im doing  Im putting together a website that makes use of prewritten articles from another website. My HTML structure just makes use of a list for links to the articles and content towards the right of that list, and thats for every page. It sounds simple, but my clientfriend has 46 prewritten articles that I need to migrate into my code My Process Since Im no pro at this, I came up with this plan. Copy each article from the website and save it in my word processor AbiWord Version 2.8 AS AN XHTML DOCUMENT. Then, view that XHTML document in a browser so that I can view the source and then copy the HTML code that is applied towards the content. In other words just the text. I did this so that I would not have to mark up the article my self with pp tags every where  etc... The copied HTML code kept most of the general spacings and quotations, but not as it was in the original website. My Problem This Process has proven to be very tedious. Because every time I copy an article and go through the process I have to update each other page so that the links are the same on all the pages. And since these are just static pages, my friend is going to need me to update the code every time he writes a new article which is often.p  pIm really getting discouraged because im new at this and dont really know whats going on. I just dont even see the point to hand coding in the first place because in the end, my friend is going to have a harder time updating and adding to his website because he now going to ahve to look for me as opposed to just using a web manager. I know some of you have spoke about CMS. I have looked into it a little, but im a still researching.p  pDoes anyone have any advice for me or a flow chart to follow for the whole process Is what im attempting to do worth it if so what are the benefitsp  pI have much more to say but this is enough for now. If you guys need anymore information in order to help me let me know.p

Negative 40130 pI am using QTMovie with QTMovieOpenForPlaybackAttributeYES, and using a QTMovieView to display it.

I have tried this, however for some reason the timeScale is set to 1000000000. I have read at a hrefhttpjongampark.wordpress.com20081027qttimeqtstringtimeandsmpte relnofollowhttpjongampark.wordpress.com20081027qttimeqtstringtimeandsmptea that the time scale is supposed to be 100fps. So why is currentTime returning that the FPS is 10000000 This seems completely incorrect. There are no flags set in the QTTime returned.p  pI have searched everywhere for information on this  any searches to do with frame rate only lead me to how to set a frame rate on capture which is not what I am looking forp  pHelp would be greatly appreciatedp

Negative 40130 pIm trying to measure the execution time of some bits of code as accurately as possible on a number of threads, taking context switching and thread downtime into account. The application is implemented in C VS 2008. Examplep  precodepublic void ThreadFunc        Some code here       Critical block 1 begins here     long lTimestamp1  Stopwatch.GetTimestamp       CallComplex3rdPartyFunc   A      long lTimestamp2  Stopwatch.GetTimestamp       Critical block 1 ends here       Some code here       Critical block 2 begins here     long lTimestamp3  Stopwatch.GetTimestamp       CallOtherComplex3rdPartyFunc   B      long lTimestamp4  Stopwatch.GetTimestamp       Critical block 2 ends here       Save timestamps for future analysis.   public int Main  string[] sArgs        Some code here      int nCount  SomeFunc       for  int i  0 i lt nCount i               Thread oThread  new Thread  ThreadFunc          oThread.Start             Some code here      return  0   codepre  pId like to measure the execution time of the above two critical code blocks as accurately as possible. The two calls marked as strongAstrong and strongBstrong are potentially long function calls that may sometimes take several seconds to execute but in some cases they may complete in a few milliseconds.p  pIm running the above code on a number of threads  somewhere between 1 to 200 threads, depending on user input. The computers running this code have 216 cores  users use lower thread counts on the weaker machines.p  pThe problem is that strongAstrong and strongBstrong are both potenitally long functions so its very likely that at least one context switch will happen during their execution  possibly more than one. So the code gets lTimestamp1, then another thread starts executing and the current thread waits. Eventually the current thread gets back control and retrieves lTimestamp2.p  pThis means that the duration between emlTimestamp1em and emlTimestamp2em includes time when the thread was not actually running  it was waiting to be scheduled again while other threads executed. The tick count, however, increases anyway, so the duration is now reallyp  blockquote   pCode block time  A  B  emsome time spent in other threadsemp blockquote  pwhile I want it to be onlyp  blockquote   pCode block time  A  Bp blockquote  pThis is especially an issue with a larger number of threads, since theyll all get a chance to run, so the above timings will be higher while all other threads run before the thread in question gets another chance to run.p  pSo my question is is it possible to somehow calculate the time when the thread is emnotem running and then adjust the above timings accordingly Id like to eliminate subtract that 3rd term entirely or at least as much of it as possible. The code runs millions of times, so final timings are calculated from a lot of samples and then averaged out.p  pIm not looking for profiler products, etc.  the application needs to time these the marked parts as accurately as possible. The functions strongAstrong and strongBstrong are 3rd party functions, I cannot change them in any way. Im also aware of the possible fluctuations when measuring time with nanosecond precision and possible overhead inside those 3rdparty functions, but I still need to do this measurement.p  pAny advice would be greatly appreciated  C or x86 assembly code would work as well.p  pstrongEditstrong seems to be impossible to implement this. Scotts idea below using GetThreadTimes is good but unfortunately GetThreadTimes is a flawed API and it almost never returns correct data. Thanks for all the repliesp

Negative 40130 pI have .swf files coming from about 50 graphic designers from all over the country, most of which have created a slideshow or video and then converted it to a .swf file.p  pI then send these files to another company that serves them through a proprietary piece of software that looks for an FSCommand ActionScript 3 to signify the end of the video.p  pI want to create something simple that I can import these .swf files they are receiving from their designers that will add the FSCommand to the last frame of the video and then reexport the file as .swf again as I often dont have a source .fla file to work with.p  pMy idea was to create a simple web app that will do this for them, my problem is I dont know enough about the .swf format or have been able to find the right information online as of yet on how to do this.p  pHoping someone here knows either how to do the above in either PHP or Ruby, if there is already an application that can do this or if you have a better idea on how to complete this task.

Negative 40130 pIm debugging my C Win32 program in VS2010 and I always get Windows has triggered a breakpoint in program.exe.p  pIve doublechecked, triplechecked, and quadruplechecked the code. I cant find emanyem reason it should be happening. But it happens at the same point each time so there must be something.p  pThere is quite a lot of code involved constructors, destructors, window messages, memory allocation and deallocation, etc... so its quite difficult to put something concrete here, but at the same time I understand that without the code you cant really do much to give an explanation.p  pBasically at the click of a button, a window is shown which shows an image. If a certain condition is met, I send a codeWMDESTROYcode to that window and delete the variable which triggers the destructor which calls codeReleasecode on my codeLPPICTUREcode, and the freed variable gets set to codeNULLcode.p  pThen, when the user clicks the button again, it tries to dynamically allocate a new instance in the exact same way it did previously, and thats where the breakpoint is generated. AFAIK and Ive been trying to debug this for over an hour now, the constructor doesnt even start. It seems to be breaking inside the codenewcode function for dynamic memory allocation.p  pAs far as I can tell, it breaks on codereturn HeapAlloccrtheap, 0, size  size  1code which is line 54 or malloc.cp  pWhats weird is that when I run the exe outside of VS2010, everything continues fine. The program doesnt crash, and it continues to work as expectedp

Here I have no problem.p  pBut, how can I use these utilities from other classes that are not managed beansp  pI will explain myselfp  pI have an exception hierarchy, where each particular exception class has to access a resource bundle property file, where the key is the name of the exception and the value is the message Im gonna show to the user. The exception constructor gets the value from the file, stores it in a field of the exception, and then the controller shows the message to the user as a facesmessage.p  pI can show the message from the controller using the utilsJSF managed bean, because I injected it into the BaseController.p  pBut I cannot inject utilsJSF into the exception class in order to use it because the exception classes are not managed beans.p  pWhats the best solution to solve this problemp

Negative 40130 pI want to write a cocoa application that checks if my ftp server is still up and running. So far I learned that CFFTP could be used but this is not object oriented code so a no go for me. Also some people recommend ConnectionKit but that wont build on 10.7. So my idea was to use terminal commands in my application with the help of NSTask. The problem is there are multiple commands that need to be executed, the first being emftp ftp.foobar.comem. Then I need to check if the response is ok or not. After that I will have to put in my username and password and also evaluate that output of that.p  pDoes anyone know how the entire ftp connection handshake can be accomplished in Objective C via NSTaskp

Negative 40130 pI want to allow a form to be sized by the user with its controls proportionaly resized. ScaleBy N,M  works fine for me but there are of course cumulative rounding errors if it is repeated. To counter this I simply wish to precede ScaleBy with a call to recreate the form in its default appearance and size and then call ScaleBy with various values. I know I can do this by hosting my form within a panel and disposing  recreating it but is there a call that will reset the form after use of ScaleByp  pEdit  I am using Delphi XE2 and would also be interested in anyones success with a component or other code paid or free to scale a form neatly  my own downloads have not produced a working solution.p
Negative 40130 pIm working on an app that does reading and handling specific URIs from NFC tags.

When I read the data from the first tag, for example T1, the reader activity goes normally trough the lifecycle and launches the data handling activity which does its job and shows the correct output. The same thing happens when I read from the next tag T2 or T3, but when I return to the first tag I get the output produced from the lastpreviously scanned tag.p  pThe log shows something like this brbr the emActivityManagerem logs the the start of the intent with the right data from T1 but the lifecycle of activity A doesnt get started, instead activity B restarts and the data from the previous intent is received and handled by calling getIntent.getData in activity B.p  pWhen switching between T2 and T3 everything works fine.p  pI would really appreciate if someone explaind me what is going on. I saw similar behaviour when setting singleTask launch mode, but Im not using it.p  pIm developing on API v.2.3.3, testing on NexusS with android version 2.3.6p  pThnxp  pp  pemEDITem I found a solution on my problem which fits my needs, still I have a question.p  pI focused on the reader activity and commented out the handling and the other stuff that was going on. Here is the code snipetp  precodepublic class NfcReaderActivity extends Activity   private static final String TAG  NfcReaderActivity  Override public void onCreateBundle savedInstanceState      super.onCreatesavedInstanceState     Log.dTAG, onCreate     setContentViewR.layout.nfcreader   Override protected void onStart      super.onStart     Log.dTAG, onStart      readAndHandleData   protected void readAndHandleData      NdefMessage[] srcObj  readSource      if srcObj  null          Uri srcData  getSrcDatasrcObj         launchSourceManagerActivitysrcData      else          Log.wTAG, srcObj was null        public NdefMessage[] readSource       Parcelable[] rawMsgs  getIntent.getParcelableArrayExtraNfcAdapter.EXTRANDEFMESSAGES     NdefMessage[] ndefMsgs  null      store NdefMessages from rawMsgs in ndefMsgs     return ndefMsgs    public void launchSourceManagerActivityUri srcData       launches DataHandlerActivity with srcData   public Uri getSrcDataNdefMessage[] src       returns the data from the tag rapresented as Uri  codepre  pp  pAfter doing this I got some extra logs dont know why, but I guess this is not that important, and saw that when Im returning to the first tag, the activity gets restarted onRestart is called, whereas in the other two cases, when scanning the second and the third tag, the activity is recreated onCreate is called.p  pWhen onRestart is called and I retrieve the data from the intent readSource method, the getIntent method returns the same intent received when scanning the previous tag.p  pI just recently started developing on Android and Im not very familiar with the concepts, so maybe this is the core problem here . I tried to figure this out but I just cant get to a logical explanation. strongIf someone could explain me the workflow here I would be really grateful.strongp  pHowever, this is how I resolved the issue...since the reader activity can act as a singleton Ive set the launch mode as singleTaskp  precodeltactivity         androidlabelstringreadernfc         androidname.reader.nfc.NfcReaderActivity         androidstateNotNeededtrue         androidlaunchModesingleTask  gt codepre  pand done the following changes in NfcReaderActivityp  precodepublic class NfcReaderActivity extends Activity   private static final String TAG  NfcReaderActivity     override onNewIntent method and store the new intent as the current intent   Override protected void onNewIntentIntent intent      super.onNewIntentintent     Log.dTAG, onNewIntent      set the intent as the current intent, so new data EXTRANDEFMESSAGES can  be accessed when calling getIntent in readSource method     setIntentintent  codepre  pThis works fine for me, but I would still like to understand what exactly was happening, so any useful of course   comments are welcome.p

Negative 40130 pI  have written a program in Visual C that checks a particular regexpandsz value in the registry for changes. The default value is  SystemRootSystem32NOTEPAD.EXE. If the value is changed, the program will reset it back to the default data.  The keys that I am modifying are either shared or reflected depending on the version of Windows, so it doesnt matter what Registry view 32bit or 64bit I modify, as the keys will be synched up.p  pMy problem that I am having is that if I am on a 64bit version of Windows and use a 32bit version of the program to change the values data to SystemRootSystem32NOTEPAD.EXE, due to the Registry redirection the data will instead be saved as SystemRootSysWOW64Notepad.exe.  This is not the correct default data though.  If I compile the program in 64bit, it works as expected.  I would rather, though, if possible have a single 32bit version that could reset the defaults regardless of whether the OS is 32bit or 64bit.p  pDoes anyone know of a way to disable this transformation of System32 to SysWOW64 in regszregexpandsz values or know another method that I can use to achieve this task  I could write out a registry file and use system to to execute reg or regedit and import it, but would rather do everything within the confines of the program itself.p  pBelow is my current codep  precode    HKEY hKey DWORD size LONG lResults  wchart szVdata[]  LSystemRootSystem32NOTEPAD.EXE 1  size  sizeofszVdata  lResults  RegOpenKeyExWHKEYLOCALMACHINE, LSoftwareClassesbatfileshelleditcommand,0, KEYALLACCESS  KEYWOW6464KEY, amphKey  iflResults  ERRORSUCCESS     RegSetValueExW hKey, L,0, REGEXPANDSZ, PBYTEszVdata, size  RegCloseKey hKey codepre  pAny help would be appreciated.p

Negative 40130 pIve been working on a Web Server which produces XML data to be used for FusionCharts. After days of unsuccessfully trying to come up with a standardized object structure in Delphi to wrap the XML production for these charts, Ive decided to look and see if someone has already done so.p  pWhat Im trying to do is build an object structure in Delphi which wraps the functionality needed to produce XML data for the FusionCharts. There are 42 possible types of charts, each of which requires a slightly different XML structure. The object structure I started building simply wraps the ability to specify the common properties of one of such charts and generate XML data on the fly based on these properties. It of course also consists of handling multiple datasets, each of which is used for a different series in the chart. There are also some oddball charts with a combination of possible datasets, which is where I got lost in trying to implement this structure.p  pI quickly came to realize that this is a huge task, and would like to see if someone has already done such a thing. I know there is a VCL library out there to display FusionCharts in an application, but this is not what I need. I just need to simply produce the XML data to be passed back through the Web Server to the HTTP client.p  pHas this already been done If not, then any tips or pointers as to how to accomplish this I was getting ready to make one single object called codeTFusionChartcode and wrap everything inside of it with a codeChartTypecode property, but there are 42 possible charts, and this would be a huge mess. I may also create 42 different objects, one for each chart, but this would have redundant code.p  pPS  Im willing to start a Bounty for this question, it is rather important.p  pstrongUPDATEstrongp  pJust to explain the existing structure of mine a little bit, I have one base component called codeTFusionChartcode. This class holds everything that all charts have in common, including category names, title, background, etc. None of the actual charts are based off of this. From this class, I then have codeTFusionChart2Dcode and codeTFusionChart3Dcode. Then I have 4 more called codeTFusionChartSingle2Dcode, codeTFusionChartMulti2Dcode, codeTFusionChartSingle3Dcode, and codeTFusionChartMulti3Dcode. From these 4 classes, I then begin creating the actual chart components. I plan to have a component for each of the possible charts that are available.p  pThe problem Im facing is confusion as to how to manage the data to be contained. Some charts can have a combination of one for example multiple series in columns, a line series, and stacked data within the columns. This one chart alone would have a very unique way of storing its data, which is difficult to share with other types of charts, for example, a simple single series column chart.p  pI tried the XML Data Binding capabilities as described in answer below, but this was far too massive of a solution that I abandoned it. Again, because of the fact that there are 42 types of charts. Each chart would mean a few thousand lines of code.p

Negative 40130 pIm in the perennial situation a query that runs instantly through SSMS with a handful of reads, but slow enough to time out with thousands of reads when run through ADO.NET.  emUnlikeem the other questions I could find on StackOverflow, clearing the query cache or forcing myself to use the one SSMS uses does not seem to be doing the trick.p  pGenerally, when others have reported this situation on StackOverflow, theyve had corrupt query caches.  In all of these cases, the fix has been either to run the ADO.NET queries with codeSET ARITHABORT ONcode to match the session settings being used by SSMS or to run codeDBCC DROPCLEANBUFFERScode and codeDBCC FREEPROCCACHEcode to force the query cache to rebuild.

Negative 40130 pI would like to write a program and run it on two machines, and send some data from one machine to another in an Ethernet frame. p  pTypically application data is at layer 7 of the OSI model, is there anything like a kernel restriction or API restriction, that would stop me from writing a program in which I can specify a destination MAC address and have some data sent to that MAC as the Ethernet payload Then write a program to listen for incoming frames and grab the frames from a specified source MAC address, extracting the payload of data from the framep  pSo I dont want any other overhead like IP or TCPUDP headers, I dont want to go higher than layer 2.p  pCan this be done in C, or must all communication happen at the IP layer, and can this be done on Ubuntu Extra love for pointing or providing examples Dp  pMy problem is obviously Im new to network programming in c and as far as I know, if I want to communicate across a network I have to use a codesocketcode call or similar, which works at an IP layer, so can I write a c program to work at OSI layer 2, are there APIs for this, does the Linux kernel even allow thisp

Negative 40130 pPlease forgive me for what may sound like a newbie question as I am just getting started with Android.p  pWhat I am attempting to accomplish is creating a custom list Item layout that contains 2 textViews and a checkbox for selecting multiple items. The problem is the checkboxes are extra selecting list items, example if I select 1 then 9 and  18 selects as well. as if the checkBox instances are recycling themselves or maybe sharing the same listener IDs if that even makes sense. Ive narrowed my code to the primary components for simplicity.

Negative 40130 pIn my recent a hrefhttpsgithub.combgamarimixturemodelworka with codeGibbs samplingcode, Ive been making great use of the a hrefhttphackage.haskell.orgpackagesarchivervar0.2.0.1dochtmlDataRVar.htmlcodeRVarcodea which, in my view, provides a near ideal interface to random number generation.  Sadly, Ive been unable to make use of Repa due to the inability to use monadic actions in maps.p  pWhile clearly monadic maps cant be parallelized in general, it seems to me that codeRVarcode may be at least one example of a monad where effects can be safely parallelized at least in principle Im not terribly familiar with the inner workings of codeRVarcode. Namely, I want to write something like the following,p  precodedrawClass  Sample gt RVar Class drawClass  ...  drawClasses  Array U DIM1 Sample gt RVar Array U DIM1 Class drawClasses samples  A.mapM drawClass samples codepre  pwhere codeA.mapMcode would look something like,p  precodemapM  ParallelMonad m gt a gt m b gt Array r sh a gt m Array r sh b codepre  pWhile clearly how this would work depends crucially on the implementation of codeRVarcode and its underlying codeRandomSourcecode, in principle one would think that this would involve drawing a new random seed for each thread spawned and proceeding as usual.p  pIntuitively, it seems that this same idea might generalize to some other monads.p  pSo, my question is Could one construct a class codeParallelMonadcode of monads for which effects can be safely parallelized presumably inhabited by, at the least, codeRVarcode p  pWhat might it look like What other monads might inhabit this class Have others considered the possibility of how this might work in Repap  pFinally, if this notion of parallel monadic actions cant be generalized, does anyone see any nice way to make this work in the specific case of codeRVarcode where it would be very useful Giving up codeRVarcode for parallelism is a very difficult tradeoff.p

Negative 40130 pIm working on improving the upload performance of a .net app that uploads groups of largeish 15mb each files to S3.p  pI have adjusted multipart options threads, chunk size, etc. and I think Ive improved that as much as possible, but while closely watching the network utilization, I noticed something unexpected.p  pI iterate over a number of files in a directory and then submit each of them for upload using an instance of the S3 transfer utility like sop  precode  prepare the upload this.transferUtility.S3Client.PutBucketnew PutBucketRequest.WithBucketNamestreamingBucket   request  new TransferUtilityUploadRequest    .WithBucketNamestreamingBucket    .WithFilePathstreamFile    .WithKeytargetFile    .WithTimeoutuploadTimeout    .WithSubscriberthis.uploadFileProgressCallback     start the upload  this.transferUtility.Uploadrequest codepre  pThen I watch for these to complete in the uploadFileProgressCallback specified above.p  pHowever when I watch the network interface, I can see a number of distinct humps in my outbound traffic graph which coincide precisely with the number of files Im uploading to S3.p  pSince this is an asynchronous call, I was under the impression that each transfer would begin immediately, and Id see a stepped increase in outbound data followed by a stepped decrease as each upload was completed.  Base on what Im seeing now I wonder if these requests, while asynchronous to the calling code, are being queued up somewhere and then executed in seriesp  pIf so Id like to change that so the request all begin uploading at close to the same time, so I can maximize the upload bandwidth I have available and reduce the overal execution time.p  pI poked around in the S3 .net SDK documentation but I couldnt find any mention of this queueing mechanism or any propertiesetc. that appeared to provide a way of increasing the concurrency of these calls.p  pAny pointers appreciatedp

Negative 40130 pToday I worked a little bit with OSGi Hooks, specially with codeFindHookcode and codeEventListenerHookcode for services. I wanted to try out proxying services. The codeEventListenerHookcode works fine and my services are proxied. But I realized that the codeFindHookcode event wouldnt be called if a service will get a reference of the service implementation by annotating the related codesetXXXcode method with codeReferencecode Bnd style. Maybe it is not a problem with the annotation, but with DS in general.p  pThis is quite bad, bc there are two services registered one without proxy and one proxied. I only want to get references from the proxied one. In general, without DS, you can get references by calling codeBundleContext.getServiceReferencejava.lang.ClassltSgt clazzcode and the event codeFindHook.findcode will be called, where you can decide which codeServiceReferencecode you want to return.p  pWhat kind of processes will be executed when Im using DS like approaches for me Bnd annotation codeReferencecode As I described in the above section I want to decide which services should be referenced.p

Negative 40130 pI recently began using PubNub in my iOS app, and am very happy with it. However, I have been looking at the other options available, such as Pusher and Realtime.co, which use Websockets. PubNub, on the other hand, uses long polling. I have done my own little speed comparisons and for my purposes, I find that they are all fast enough.p  pPubNub offers some nice features like message history and a list of everyone in the channel , so barring everything else I am leaning toward them. My question is, should I be concerned with battery life and heavy usage with a longpolling solution like PubNub Would a Websockets solution be significantly more power efficientp

Negative 40130 pMy friend and I are working on a project using C and OpenGL. Weve created a C class for a ModelObject, and each ModelObject has a GLuint vao as a member variable.

Now were trying to render 2 objects, a train car and a cube. On his machine Linux Mint they both render fine, with their own textures, and querying the objects for their vaos returns 1 and 2 respectively. p  pOn my machine however a MacBook Pro, both objects render as a cube though one has the texture of a train and the other the texture of the cube. Querying their vaos returns 0 and 0.p  pAs an experiment we told glGenVertexArrays to create 5 vaos for each ModelObject. This resulted in the list 0, 1, 918273, 8, 7 or something similar to that, and it was the same list for both ModelObjects.p  pSo as far as I can tell the problem is that glGenVertexArrays is both a using 0 as a valid address, and b generating identical addresses on each call, even though were never calling glDeleteVertexArray. Why would it be doing this on my machine and not his, and how do I stop itp

My program cannot distinguish the difference between the same ActorIDs located in separate MovieIDs. It just displays all the information related to that specific ID. So no matter whether I click on Bob or Mike both have actorID1, the page displays the information for both Bob and Mike their names and ages.p  pThis is what the actordetails page displaysp  pimg srchttpi.imgur.comKD1KKAd.jpg altactors pagep  pThis is what I want the actordetails page to displayp  pimg srchttpi.imgur.comEqVANEr.jpg altactors page 2p  pSo even though Bob and Mike have the same ActorIDs, they are related to different MovieIDs, and therefore, I want to display their information separately. p

If you view that image, youll notice its original size is 640 by 480.

Its just clipping the top left bit of it. If you adjust the css rule with the IE9 Developer Tools youll see what I mean.p  pI dug around lots and confirmed that I had been following most of the svg best practices, like including width and height values that arent just 100, including a viewport, and so on, but no luck.

Negative 40130 pI am relatively new to programming and thus have limited experience when it comes to the logic involved in getting scripts to work as I want.p  pstrongIn a nutshell I have an Arduino connected to a raspberry pi Raspbian. The Arduino controls sensors while the raspberry pi acts as a web serverstrong. I have created a database in MySQL containing one database with two tables. The first table needs to receive an codeINSERTcode  every 5 minutes through script code1.pycode and the second table gets an codeUPDATEcode every minute. Both tables receive values from the Arduino.p  pI can run each script separately, and it works fine. I can join the two scripts and that works too, BUT because I use cron, they both run at the SAME time interval e.g., 5 minutes. If I run both scripts 5 minute interval and 1 minute interval through cron, only one works. I think it has something to do with the timing of the open and close connectionsp  pstrongAre there any suggestions as to how I can get this to workstrong Ideally I would like 1 script to run every 5 minutes and the other every 5 seconds cron cant do seconds. p

Negative 40130 pAs my scrum team does backlog grooming, we typically start with epiclevel work, and refine those PBIs into themes and stories as part of normal grooming activities. As a means of structuring these work items, the PBIs that result from refining and clarifying other PBIs are created as child links of the larger items. We implement this process by assigning only sprintable stories to sprints, while leaving their parent theme PBIs in the current release iteration.p  pWeve been slowly growing into the features provided by 2012 after an upgrade earlier this year, and the ability to drag items around in the Product Backlog view in Web Access rather than manually tweaking priority values is extremely attractive. p  pWed like to use this, but theres a problem PBIs that have a parentchild relationship, as do most of our planned work, cant be dragged around individually. Instead, each epic appears as a tree in the product backlog, enumerating its children with its own priority range of [1..1000000], and it drags around atomically.p  pWith this in mind, how is this supposed to work Am I missing something about the features of the Product Backlog view Are we intended to be destroying our epics and themes as theyre refined into smaller PBIs, so that the stories can be scheduled independentlyp

I changed my question accordingly because most of the people were confused.p  pstrongEDIT2strong Trying to change my code The dispatcher would look like below. The tile and sample could be different for each invocation but could be the same for some. Other actions will be applied except for addSample.

Negative 40130 pI am using MVVM Light and have used the packaged messenger system to communicate between view models, however I have hit a bit of a dilemma Basically when a user clicks on a customer record the corresponding view is opened and with it the emCustomerViewModelem is instantiated. At this point the emCustomerViewModelem requires the selected customers ID from the previous view model emViewAllCustomersViewModelem so that it can get selected customers info which the view binds to still following. So initially my thought was too send that ID in a message from the emViewAllCustomersViewModelem where the customer to be viewed is selected to the emCustomerViewModelem... HOWEVER, the emCustomerViewModelem is not instantiated to be able to receive the message until the view is loaded at which point the message has already been broadcastp  pSo, what would be the best way to solve this issue So far I have considered the emCustomerViewModelem sending a request to the emViewAllCustomersViewModelem once it has been instantiated basically saying I am ready to receive the message, and then the emViewAllCustomersViewModelem sending the ID back to the emCustomerViewModelem... but is this a necessary approach to solve this It seems a bit ugly to mep  pOtherwise, I was thinking is there another way to communicate which can account for the issue I am having But then isnt this the whole point of the messaging system... to be able to communicate between view models OR can I force the view model to be instantiated on start up If so, how would that affect the emViewModelLocatoremp  pI hope I have outlined the issue clearly, I have used fictional view model names for the purpose of the explanation... and please feel free to edit or suggest any additional information that you would like me to addp

Negative 40130 pIf I have a base abstract class like sop  precodeltphp abstract class Record      static table      public function getRows           return getRowsFromTablestatictable       gt codepre  pAnd I want to extend this class like sop  precodeltphp class User extends Record      static table  users      private name gt codepre  pThen if I callp  precodeltphp user  new User usergtgetRows gt codepre  pInternally, codegetRowscode calls and returns codegetRowsFromTableuserscode.p  pBut if I were to create another class that also extends codeRecordcodep  precodeltphp class House extends Record      static table  houses      private address gt codepre  pThen that codestatic table  housescode declaration overrides the codeRecordtablecode and, consequently, breaks the codeUsercode class.p  pWhats happening is, the declaration codestatic table  housescode bubbles up to the parent class, so now codeRecordtable  housescode. Since codeHousecode was declared after codeUsercode, the next time I call codeusergtgetRowscode, internally, codeUsercode references parent codeRecordcode and ultimately calls codegetRowsFromTablehousescode instead of codegetRowsFromTableuserscode.p  pIm using late static binding so as to get the property from the extended class but since codeUsercode and codeHousecode extend the same parent class, they both end up with the same property value although they override it with different values.p  pIf I were to duplicate the codeRecordcode class by creating a class codeRecord2code and having codeHousecode extend codeRecord2code, I wouldnt have this problem  but that wouldnt really help.p  pIs this the wrong setup Should I not be using static variables in this context What should I put in their place, if so I know that codetablecode doesnt necessarily have to be static, but there are other properties that may need to be static.p
Negative 40130 pIm writing two programs one that encrypts a file given in the first argument, with a ASCII seed given in the second argument, and another that decrypts the encrypted file. The algorithm uses AES128 in CBC stream cipher mode. The file is read into a buffer, a SHA1 hash is produced and attached to the plaintext, and then encrypted. The seed is also produced by SHA1. The program that decrypts using the same seed separates the message from the digest and compares the digest with a locally produced hash. So far, the two programs work perfectly for a .txt file, but if I try to encryptdecrypt a .jpg or .png file, all that is left of the original image is a small part of the top  the rest is just random colors. .zip files come out corrupted.p  pMy code is pretty large, my apologies.p  pencryptp  precodepublic class secureFile   private static SecretKeySpec seckeyspec private static Cipher seccipher

Negative 40130 pOur website provides various data services to our clients one of which is gauge data. Some gauges log information every 15 minutes, some every minute. This data is sent to our SQL database. p  pAll of this data is displayed via a graph generated server side via PHP and JPGraphs with each individual log entry being displayed as a row in a collapsible table jquery 1.10.2.p  pWhen a client wants to view the data, they select a date range and which gauges they would like to view.  If they want to view the last 3 days of a gauge that logs every minute then it loads pretty quickly. If they want to view 2 of those then it takes around 1530 seconds to load. The real problem comes when they want to view a months worth of data especially more than 1 gauge.  This can take upwards of 1520 minutes to load and the browser repeatedly asks if we want to stop the script from populating the collapsible table rowsjquery. p  pObviously this is a problem since clients want a relatively fast response 15 min max. Ideally, we would also like to be able to pull gauge data from several months at a time. The only way we can do that now is to pull data 2 weeks at a time and compile the total manually.p  pFor reference If I wanted to pull a months data for 2 of our onceaminutelogging gauges, then there would be 86,400 rows added via jQuery to a collapsible table. The page takes approx. 5 minutes to load and the browser is terribly slow during this time period.p  pMy question is What is the best way to pullgraphpopulate data using a PHP based server Symfony 1.4 framework and javascriptp  pShould we look into upgrading our allotted processing powerRAMwe are hosted by GoDaddy  Is there a faster way to populate collapsibles than with jquery All of our calculatoins are done server side.

I followed this tutorial to the point where I was using PHPMySQL to connect to the DB, run a query, fetch the query using a fetchassoc array. but nothing would display in the body of the page. During the trouble shooting process I was advised that I should be using PDO instead of the older MySQL methods. Can someone decipher my current older MySQL code and translate it into the proper PDO coding approach so that I can learn to grasp PDO, since it is the future I should start to understand it now p  h2index.phph2  precodeltphp  Setup document includeconfigsetup.php  gt  ltDOCTYPE HTMLgt lthtmlgt ltheadgt ltmeta charsetutf8gt lttitlegtltphp echo pagetitle gt  test sitelttitlegt  ltlink relstylesheet typetextcss hrefcssstyles.cssgt  ltheadgt  ltbodygt   ltdiv classwrapoverallgt      ltdiv classheadergt        ltphp includetemplateheader.php gt     ltdivgt      ltdiv classnavmaingt         ltphp includetemplatenavmain.php gt     ltdivgt      ltdiv classcontentgt         ltphp includecontent.pg..php          the database connection, our query         q  SELECT  FROM pages WHERE page  pg AND status  1 LIMIT 1         r  mysqliquerydbc, q          if r           dieInvalid query  . mysqlerror                    page  mysqlifetchassocr          echo lth1gt.page[title].lth1gt         echo ltdiv classcontentbodygt.page[body].ltdivgt           gt         ltdivgt      ltdiv classfootergt         ltphp includetemplatefooter.php gt     ltdivgt    ltdivgt  ltbodygt lthtmlgt codepre  h2setup.phph2  precodeltphp  Setup Document  hostor location of the database, username, password, database name Variables for connecting to your database.

Upon hitting enter, the loop needs to execute all of the code below the whilecinpreInput statement, clear the userInput vector, and repeat until the character Q is entered.  This is not whats happening.  The way the loop is currently written, The program takes user input until the user hits Q, enter essentially does nothing.  I need the code to execute whenever the user hits enter.

To reiterate, if the user enters 123 userInputs[0] should be 1, userInputs[1] should be 2...and so on.p  pEssentially, the only thing that needs to be changed is that the whilecinpreInput loop must break when the user hits enter.p

Negative 40130 pI have codedlopencodeed a library, and I want to invert back from the handle it passes to me to the full pathname of shared library.  On Linux and friends, I know that I can use codedlinfocode to get the linkmap and iterate through those structures, but I cant seem to find an analogue on OSX.  The closest thing I can do is to eitherp  ul lipUse codedyldimagecountcode and codedyldgetimagenamecode, iterate over all the currently opened libraries and hope I can guess which one corresponds to my handlepli lipSomehow find a symbol that lives inside of the handle I have, and pass that to codedladdrcode.pli ul  pIf I have apriori knowledge as to a symbol name inside of the library I just opened, I can codedlsymcode that and then use codedladdrcode.  That works fine.  But in the general case where I have no idea what is inside this shared library, I would need to be able to enumerate symbols to do that, which I dont know how to do either.p  pSo any tips on how to lookup the pathname of a library from its codedlopencode handle would be very much appreciated.

Negative 40130 pI may be missing something very simple here, but whats the benefit of using reflection to retrieve an embedded resource from the strongsame assembly that contains the resourcestrong as opposed to simply retrieving it via an .resx file I see this a lot but dont get it  is there a reason to use codeAssembly.GetExecutingAssembly.GetManifestResourceStreamresourcecode compared to resx file codeResources.resourcecode Even Microsoft does it a hrefhttpsupport.microsoft.comkb319292 relnofollowHow to embed and access resourcesa.p  pWhat I mean exactly suppose I have an assembly codeMyAssemblycode that contains an embedded resource codeConfig.xmlcode.

Is there a way of p  pa change the jagged effect of the flames like the yellow ones so as they do not cut off on the edges of the canvesp  porp  pb Make the entire animation softer around the canvas edges or fadep  pI have been searching for standard HTML5 canvas flame tutorials online but they are either really complex or really cheesy.

Negative 40130 pHow can I record what a browser renders into a videop  pI would like to create an AnimationIllustration Video using HTML, CSS and Javascript. However, I would like to render what is happening in the the browser into a Video mp4, avi, mkv, ... with a constant frame rate e.g. 30, but only the content area, not the whole desktop nor the browsers menuscroll bars.p  pAudio is not a concern here. Also, the animation is not interactive.p  pWhat is the easiest way to do that Is there a command line tool that can render a dynamic page frame by frame into a set of images, ideally I can specify the timewindow I would like to render e.g. from 000123 to 000345 Using a screenwindow capture tool and a fullscreenbrowser and a video cutting toolp  pIdeally, the solution works in Linux, but other OSes are fine.p

Negative 40130 pHow do you combinemerge identical sublists into one sublist, and append the nonidentical part at the end of the listp  pFor example, the only differentiating factor within these sublists are week numbers and the counts at the end of each sublist. Id like to have only one sublist for each unique UserId,Amount, and Email and append the nonidentical part to this one sublist. p  pTo complicate things further, Id like the order of the counts to be in the order by which week they fall under. For example, below you can see 1 for week 1, 10 for week 2, 14 for week 4, and nothing for week 3. In the case that there is no value, append a 0 instead.  p  precodelst  [         [           [UserID,Amount,Email,week1,1],           [UserID,Amount,Email,week4,14],           [UserID,Amount,Email,week2,10]          ],         [           [UserID2,Amount,Email,week1,99],           [UserID2,Amount,Email,week2,10],           [UserID2,Amount,Email,week4,14]         ]       ]  DesiredList  [                  [UserID,Amount,Email,week1,1,10,0,14],                  [UserID2,Amount,Email,week1,99,10,0,14]                ] codepre  pThis would combine them to produce the result, but it does not place a 0 for missing weeks p  precode[grp[0][1][item[1] for item in grp] for grp in lst] codepre

Negative 40130 pFetching  Deleting an object with NHibernate is extremely slow if it is a more complex object and the database has some data in it already. p  pstrongExamplestrongbr    ObjectA about 150.000 entries in database    ObjectB referring to ObjectA about 200.000 entries in database    ObjectC one to one relationship to ObjectA    ObjectD many to one relationship to ObjectC, about 800.000 entries  p  pDeleting ObjectA also deletes all other Objects listed above.

Negative 40130 pIf Ive got a python web app that needs to load a few heavy modules into memory I seem to run into an issue of the time it takes to load.

Negative 40130 pI have 3 classes of conjugation tables  one for emnounsem, emadjectivesem and emverbsem. As suggested in the a hrefhttpstackoverflow.coma215046041986871answera to a previous question of mine, it would be greatly beneficial to have a base class for the strongverbsstrong, and use an codeEnumcode to have all the actual conjugation strongtypesstrong, so that I could distinguish between instances of the class. The codeEnumcode would look like thisp  precodeenum VerbConjugationType      IndicativePresent,     Participle,      etc  codepre  pand the codeVerbConjugationcode classp  precodeclass VerbConjugation      public VerbConjugationType conjugationType  get set      public string firstPersonSingular  get set      public string secondPersonSingular  get set      public string thirdPersonSingular  get set      public string firstPersonPlural  get set      public string secondPersonPlural  get set      public string thirdPersonPlural  get set      public string present  get set      public string past  get set   codepre  pHowever, there is one slight problem  several of the strongtypesstrong of verb conjugations dont have the same format, that is to say that codeIndicativePresentcode looks like thisp  precode   public string firstPersonSingular  get set    public string secondPersonSingular  get set    public string thirdPersonSingular  get set    public string firstPersonPlural  get set    public string secondPersonPlural  get set    public string thirdPersonPlural  get set   codepre  pand codeParticiplecode looks like thisp  precode   public string present  get set    public string past  get set   codepre  pIs there any way to have a emsingle classem codeVerbConjugationcode that can be instantiated with different emsetsem of data depending on the codeVerbConjugationTypecode which would be an codeEnumcode That is to say, if I instantiate codeVerbConjugationcode with codeVerbConjugationTypecode of strongIndicativePresentstrong, I want only the data as shown above to be members of that eminstanceem of the class.

Negative 40130 pI am new to dynamic languages in general, and I have discovered that languages like Python prefer simple data structures, like dictionaries, for sending data between parts of a system across functions, modules, etc.p  pIn the C world, when two parts of a system communicate, the developer defines a class possibly one that implements an interface that contains properties like a Person class with a Name, Birth date, etc where the sender in the system instantiates the class and assigns values to the properties.  The receiver then accesses these properties.  The class is called a DTO and it is well defined and strongexplicitstrong.  If I remove a property from the DTOs class, the compiler will instantly warn me of all parts of the code that use that DTO and are attempting to access what is now a nonexistent property.  I know exactly what has broken in my codebase.p  pIn Python, functions that produce data senders create strongimplicitstrong DTOs by building up dictionaries and returning them.  Coming from a compiled world, this scares me.  I immediately think of the scenario of a large code base where a function producing a dictionary has the name of a key changed or a key is removed altogether and boom tons of potential KeyErrors begin to crop up as pieces of the code base that work with that dictionary and expect a key are no longer able to access the data they were expecting.  Without unit testing, the developer would have no reliable way of knowing where these errors will appear.p  pMaybe I misunderstand altogether.  Are dictionaries a best practice tool for passing data around  If so, how do developers solve this kind of problem  How are implicit data structures and the functions that use them maintained  How do I become less afraid of what seems like a huge amount of uncertaintyp

Negative 40130 pIm using Castle.Windsor IoC for loading plugins on runtime. These plugins provide both logic and UI implementation, such as overview and detail view panes to be inserted into my applications main window. Each provided interface implementation contains a path that distinctly references it, and the registration of the classes is in transient lifestyle mode.p  pNow, it seems that I am running into trouble considering communication between UI components Normally I would have added delegate methods to the event queue of the UI elements inside the main windows code. But since the main window does not know anything specific about the events of the loaded controls, this would not work.p  pMy first workaround would be to resolve the registered instance from the IoC container and attach to its event queue  but Im not sure if this works with transient lifestyle mode and not linking to libraries leaves me unaware of the event signatures. What if an element from library A wants to watch another libraries event queuep  pAny ideas on how to solve thisp

Or I can delete an engine and Rails automatically deletes the associated car, and viceversa.p
Negative 40130 pI have a codeTimeSpancode variable that can be some time like code100000code or some time like 102300 And also I have another codeTimeSpancode variable that is used to set the time interval, currently as default it is set on one hour intervals so code10000codep  pI am looking for a good way to determine if my timespan variable falls into my interval or not For example if interval is every one hour then code100000code is ok because we have hours or 1,2,3,4,5,etc.. but code102300code is not ok because we have code10code and code11code but not code1023codep  pIs there any built in .NET way to determine this if there is not then what is a good way to determine this.p

Negative 40130 pIm having a problem when I try to push a viewController onto a UINavigationViewController. I can do this once and it works fine. But when I push a second VC onto the nav controller the background for this second VC is black. All the views on that second VC are shown, but the background shows as black. It should show a background image like my other VCs but it doesnt.p  pI am using XCode 5 to develop an IOS app for the iPhone. I am not using ARC, autolayout or storyboards i.e., I am using some slightly oldschool iOS development. I have a main interface that has a button on it which I will call the Add Widget button. When the user presses this button, this is the code that gets executedp  precodeWidgetNameVC vc  [[WidgetNameVC alloc] initWithNibNameWidgetNameVC bundlenil] vc.delegate  self vc.nameNavself.navigationController [self.navigationController pushViewControllervc animatedYES] [vc release] codepre  pAs you can see I am saving the navigationController into a property vc.nameNav in this first new view controller. This code executes fine and behaves properly.p  pThe WidgetNameVC has a XIB file that contains several views, one of which is a button which I will call the Widget Details button. When I press the Widget Details button, this is the code that gets executedp  precodeWidgetInfoVC vc  [[WidgetInfoVC alloc] initWithNibNameWidgetInfoVC bundlenil] vc.nameNavself.nameNav [self.nameNav pushViewControllervc animatedYES] [vc release] codepre  pIn other words, I am pushing this second VC onto the navigationController stack. This is where things break. It shows WidgetInfoVC, but shows it with a black background which is not what I want. All my VCs inherit from my own class BaseVC which sets a background image. It seems as though pushing this second VC WidgetInfoVC somehow destroys the background image. Nothing I do seems to fix this. p  pAny ideasp

Can someone please explain to me why is thatp  pUpdate Sorry if I was not clear, but I do not want to convert to nvarchar, I want to keep my field as varchar.

The user then presses a Play button and these tracks are streamedlayered together and play as a form of soundscape.p  pI am having two issues at the present time.p  pNumber 1p  pWhen the first option in the table is checkmarked... so is the 9th option further down the list... When the second option is selected... the the 10th option is also selected etc...p  pThis is not ideal as it is selecting options the user does not intend. I have seen similar posts but my attempts to fix this based on those has not worked.p  pIssue Number 2p  pImplementing the audio from here has proved extremely difficult... Ive been trying to use the AVplayer which i still dont know if it is the correct option... any help with this also will be greatly appreciated.p  pI have .plists for the text in the table, the thumbnail names, and the track names, the .mp3 files and thumbnails are correctly placed in my project. The audio however i cannot get to work.p  pHere is the code of my .m file.p  precodeimport ASMRTableViewController.h  interface ASMRTableViewController   end  implementation ASMRTableViewController  NSArray names NSArray thumbnails NSArray tracks    voidviewDidLoad  [super viewDidLoad]    Find out the path of the property list NSString path  [[NSBundle mainBundle] pathForResourceExternalData ofTypeplist]   Load the file content and read the data into arrays NSDictionary dict  [[NSDictionary alloc] initWithContentsOfFilepath] names  [dict objectForKeyName] thumbnails  [dict objectForKeyThumbnail] tracks  [dict objectForKeyTrack]     NSIntegernumberOfSectionsInTableViewUITableView tableView   Return the number of sections. return 1    voiddidReceiveMemoryWarning  [super didReceiveMemoryWarning]  Dispose of any resources that can be recreated.

Negative 40130 pI want to develop my own operating system from the beginning. But I have some doubts about dynamic memory allocation. For example There will be a linked list that implements a ready process queue. When I allocate memory in my programs, I use malloc. But, could I use malloc directly in the kernel implementation Or I must develop my own memory allocator I am not sure, but I think that malloc uses system calls to check the page table, so I could not use that in my own kernel. If I cant use malloc, how could I allocate memory for the queuep  pThanks.p

Negative 40130 pI am trying to switch one of my apps from ObjectiveC to swift. There are some things in swift language that I cant get to work. First of all, I have a codeModelcode class which I initialise in AppDelegates codedidFinishLaunchingWithOptionscode. I declare the codeModelcodes object in the code.hcode file in ObjectiveC like thisp  precodepropertynonatomic,retainModel model codepre  pThe in the codedidFinishLaunchingWithOptionscode I initialise itp  precodeself.model[[Model alloc]init] codepre  pAnd then I have the following methodp  precodeModel getCurrentModel             AppDelegate appdelegateAppDelegate [UIApplication sharedApplication].delegate             return appdelegate.model          codepre  pAnd then I can access the current instance of codeModelcode from any class by callingp  precodemodel  [AppDelegate getCurrentModel] codepre  pSo, the first question, how can I do the same in Swift Especially the static functionsthe function that begin with codecode. I tried thisp  precodeclass AppDelegate UIResponder, UIApplicationDelegate       var window UIWindow     var model  Model  func applicationapplication UIApplication, didFinishLaunchingWithOptions launchOptions NSDictionary gt Bool           Override point for customization after application launch.         model  Model         return true       class var currentModel  Model          struct Static              static let instance  Model  AppDelegate.sharedApplication.delegate error AppDelegate.Type does not have a member named sharedApplication                  return Static.instance.model      codepre  pSecond question. In Objective C, we can make an instance variable and global variable and global function by declaring incode.hcode file like thisp  precodeinterface ViewController  UIViewController      Instance Variables     NSString aName  Properties or variables that can be accessed globally NSString anotherName  Methods that have global scope  voiddoSomething end codepre  pThose functions that are not declared in the code.hcode file have a local scope.

Negative 40130 pI just started using a hrefhttpwww.heidisql.com relnofollowHeidiSQLa to manage my databases at work. I was previously using NaviCat, and I was able to simply drag and drop a database from one server to a database on another server and copy all the tables and datapiece of cake, backed up. Similar functionality isnt obvious in Heidi, but I decided using mysqldump is a standard way of backing up a database and I should get to know it.p  pI used Heidi to perform the dumpcreating databases, creating tables, inserting data, and making one single SQL file. This was performed on one single database that is 801.7 MB checksum 1755734665. When I executed the dump file on my local doppelganger database it appeared to work flawlessly, however the database size is 794.0 MB checksum 2937674450.p  pSo, by creating a new database from a mysqldump of a database I lost 7.7 MB of something and the databases have different checksumsnot sure what that means though. I searched and found a post saying that performing a mysqldump can optimize a database, but could not find any conclusive information.p  pAm I being a helicopter parent Is there any easy way to make sure I didnt lose datastructure somehowp  pThank you, Kaip

Negative 40130 pI wish to perform multiple regressions conditionally based on the value of a categorical variable.  So, for a simple example, consider the sashelp.class data.  I need to perform a regression for males and another for females.  Since my dataset has many more divisions and is much larger, I start by feeding the different types into macro variablesp  precodeproc sql     select countdistinct Sex into numsex     from sashelp.class     let numsexampnumsex     select distinct Sex into sex1  sexampnumsex     from sashelp.class quit codepre  pThen I am trying to perform a regression on each one by looping them through.  I know the commented out code works, but am unsure why my macro function is not working.p  precode data dataF   set sashelp.class   where SexF run  proc reg datadataF outestout1   model HeightWeight run  macro regress do i  1 to ampnumsex  data dataampampsexampi     set sashelp.class     where Sexampampsexampi run  proc reg datadataampampsexampi outestoutampi     model HeightWeight run end mend regress codepre  pAlso, if there is a better way to do this, then Im all ears.  The current way is a pain since I will have to combine all of my output sets of the estimates to get one dataset.  Also, I get a bunch of intermediate datasets that I dont want or need.p  pThanks.p

Negative 40130 pI am a geologist working in the oil and gas business. I am also responsible for all of our technology. Over the past few weeks I have been designing a macro that interfaces with the Louisiana Department of Natural Resources website in order o create a program that automatically compiles production information. This website has been a huge help and the advice given by the users has been invaluable. I am once again stuck though, and in need of some help.p  pBefore I get into what I need, I just want to credit the users Jeeped and mrbungle for creating this code. It works just like I asked and has been a enormous success.p  pThe way the code works is that the code takes a serial number of a oil well in column A and then goes out to the Louisiana DNR website and uses this serial number to download the production report into a new worksheet. This new worksheet is named based on the value in Column C of the first worksheet.p  pCurrently, the code is written to retrieve the entire report and then to cut all the information out except for one table that I am interested in.p  pI would like to preserve 2 tables now instead of 1. I cant figure out how to do it. I have attempted to add a frow2 and lrow2 variable that equate to the second table I want preserved however due to the cut function, only the lower table will be preserved since the cut function cuts all data above a certain point. I think the answer lies somewhere in how to word the cut function. I cant figure out how to do it though.p  pThe way the cut function works presently is that it cuts all data above and below certain table names on the downloaded sheetp  pThe tables I would like to preserve are in order the Wells and the Perforations tablep  pHere is a serial number to a well in case you want to test out the program 57711p  pThe code is belowp  precodeOption Explicit  Public Const csURL As String        httpsonlite.dnr.state.la.ussundowncartprodcartconwellinfo2pWSNWSN Sub GatherPerforationsData Dim rw As Long, lr As Long, w As Long, wsn As String, wb As Workbook, frow As String, lrow As String  On Error Resume Next If Err.Number ltgt 0 Then MsgBox Exception occured  amp Err.Decscription  Application.ScreenUpdating  False Application.DisplayAlerts  False    With ThisWorkbook.SheetsWSNs     lr  .CellsRows.Count, 1.EndxlUp.Row     For rw  2 To lr         .Cellsrw, 2  0         For w  1 To .Parent.Sheets.Count             If .Parent.Sheetsw.Name  CStr.Cellsrw, 1.Value Then                 .Parent.Sheetsw.Delete                 Exit For             End If         Next w         wsn  ReplacecsURL, WSN, .Cellsrw, 1.Value         Set wb  Workbooks.OpenFilenamewsn, ReadOnlyTrue, addtomruFalse          frow  Application.WorksheetFunction.MatchPerforations, RangeAA, 0         lrow  Application.WorksheetFunction.MatchWell Tests, RangeAA, 0         lrow  lrow  1         frow  A amp frow         lrow  F amp lrow         Rangefrow, lrow.Cut RangeQ1         ColumnsAP.Select         Selection.Delete ShiftxlToLeft         Cells.EntireColumn.AutoFit          wb.Sheets1.RangeA1A3.Font.Size  12         wb.Sheets1.Copy After.Parent.Sheets.Parent.Sheets.Count         .Parent.Sheets.Parent.Sheets.Count.Name  .Cellsrw, 3.Value         wb.Close savechangesFalse         Set wb  Nothing         .Cellsrw, 2  1         Application.ScreenUpdating  True         Application.ScreenUpdating  False         .Parent.Save     Next rw     .Activate End With codepre  pFn     Application.DisplayAlerts  True     Application.ScreenUpdating  True End Subp  pPlease let me know if I can explain anything better. p

Negative 40130 pIs there a standard way of documenting .properties files Something in the spirit of Javadoc where I have properties and documentation in the same file and can leverage IDE integrationp  pIt might sound trivial but to illustrate my problem, consider the following example Lets say I have a Java application which is controlled by a central .properties file in the formatp  precodekey1value1 key2value2 codepre  pTo document the meaning of property keys I could use comments like thisp  precode key1 does this and that key1value1 codepre  pBut what if I have settings that are applied more than oncep  precode key1 causes component1 to behave so and so component1.key1value1   key1 causes component2 to behave so and so component2.key1value2 codepre  pIn the above, the meaning of codekey1code is the same in both properties. However, I dont want to repeat the comment because I might have hundreds of components to which the codekey1code property is applied. I could use a single comment at the beginning like thisp  precode key1 causes the affected component to behave so and so component1.key1value1 component2.key1value2 .... codepre  pBut then if I add a new component at the end, I would have to scroll up every time to find the associated documentation comment.p  pIm looking for a way to define the meaning of the property patternp  precode[COMPONENT].key1value1 codepre  pin a way that I can easily refer to that documentation in an IDE  just like you do with Java code and Javadoc.p

Two important facts p  p1 Were using EF 6 with Lazy Loading as suggested by the virtual keywords.p  p2 Since every book is tracked individually the number of Book entries in the database will become great quickly. The table will likely have a size of hundreds of millions on the long run. We will perhaps be adding up to 100,000 books per day.p  pThe opinion I supported is that the current implementation is fine and that were not going to run into problems. My understanding is that a SQL statement would be generated to filter the collection when GetEnumerator is called.p  pThe other suggestion made by my coworker is to cache the number of books. That means updating a field int ComputedNumberOfBooks whenever the AddBookToStock or SellBook methods would be called. This field would need to be repeated and updated in both the Store and Corporation classes. Then of course we would need to take care of concurrencyp  pI know adding these fields wouldnt be a big deal, but I really feel bad about this idea. To me it looks like preengineering a problem that doesnt exist, and that in my opinion wont exist.p  pI decided to check again my claims with SO and found 2 contradicting answers p  pa hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions6309151arenavigationpropertiesreadeachtimetheyareaccessedef41One saying that the whole Books collection would be pulled to memorya, since ICollection only inherits from IEnumerable. a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions20342174entityframeworkfilteringnavigationpropertiesThe other saying the opposite  the navigation property will be treated as an IQueryable until it is evaluateda.Why not since the property is wrapped by a proxy p  pSo here are my questions  p  p1 What is the truth p  p2 Even if the whole collection is referenced, dont you think that its not a big deal since it would be an IEnumerable low memory usage.p  p3 What do you think of the memory consumption  performance hit on this example, and what would be the best way to go      p  pThank youp

I mean in my understanding of a thread pool, there is a limited number of threads that start to take tasks.

Negative 40130 pI started a new job and we use Windows servers for PHP local, dev, stage, live, but the new project was committed with Git for Windows with the default setting use Unixstyle line endings for commits paraphrasing selected by the team members, and now any file I open with Notepad shows files with no newlines.p  pI can use other file editors to read the files though its more steps for quick views, but Im worried that the Unixstyle line endings will cause issues with Windows servers. I havent seen a problem yet with the new or old code the latter of which had mixed files, and committing with CRLF shows up in the git diff, so it could look bad unless all files are converted at the same time with an obvious message.p  pIs it going to be worth converting to CRLF I doubt the system will move to Unix theyre entrenched pretty heavily and use IBM System i infrastructure as their data backbone, but Im not sure Unixstyle line endings will cause a problem.p

Negative 40130 pWhat are the rationale and implications for throwing codeKeyErrorcode instead of returning codeNonecode when accessing an unset property on a Python dictionaryp  pI know that language design involves tradeoffs, some of them based on practical concerns and some based primarily on philosophy. From a computer science perspective, why has Python been designed in this wayp  h3A couple of notes to frame the questionh3  ul liIm primarily curious to know if this was a practical decision i.e., it gives the developer more options to recover from the error than just returning codeNonecode, or if the choice was philosophical i.e., accessing an unset property is, in Guidos opinion, an exceptional case.li liPythons codedict.getcode function has this functionality, but the literal notation appears to be optimizing for the case where the program considers an unset value exceptional.li liIts worth noting that exception handling is considered by some to be hard to reason about because it involves a hrefhttpwww.cs.virginia.eduweimerpweimertoplas2008.pdf relnofollowa control flow that is distinct from the main programali liIf Python returned codeNonecode instead of raising an exception, a program could still check for the keys existence prior to accessing its value if it did want to treat unset and codeNonecode values differently.

Negative 40130 pHaving added WebApi to an MVC 5 project .aspx AND Razor engines I am trying to add Attribute Routing however whenever I add this linep  precode Web API routes

The problem is, I have no idea how I can calculate what this value should be.p  pCan anyone help or point me to some resources Alternatively, I could use the fact that I know the coordinate of every vertex in the shape to fill in these pentagons by drawing triangles using LibGDXs ModelBuilder.

For Any change Add, Update, Delete a copy of that record gets saved to its shadow table were using the term Version.p  pIf we have a table called Profiles with columns intProfileId, varchar50Name, dateUpdateDate, etc... we would have another table called ProfilesVersion with columns intProfileVersionId, intProfileId, varchar50Name, dateUpdateDate, etc... p  pIm working on the system to make the copies. In the past I have used triggers in the database to catch Insert, Update, Delete. But now were trying to do it using Entity Framework and Linq.p  pI can override the SaveChanges on DbContext, and get a second copy into the Version table. However, the key Id that gets populated on the first table does not end up in the Version table.p  pWith Entity Framework, you can have two inserts to the database with data from one entity getting applied to the second. For instancep  precodevar res  new Resource     SomeValue  someParameter  db.Resource.Addres  var newProfile  new Profile     ProfileValue  anotherParameter,      ForeignResourceId  res.ResourceId  ResourceId is autogenerated   db.Profile.AddnewProfile db.SaveChanges  var forResourceId  newProfile.ForeignResourceId  codepre  pSince Profile.ForeignResourceId and Resource.ResourceId are mapped in the model, the newProfile object has the ForeignResourceId that was assigned by the database after SaveChanges. Somehow entity framework knows to put res.ResourceId into ForeignResourceId once it has been generated from the database.p  pMy code which dynamically copies values from one entity into the Version table does not do that. It simply copies data from the first entity into the new record for the Version entity, but doesnt setup the relationship to populate the key field with the foreign key.  p  precodepublic int SaveChangesGuid userId       ... some other code       entityEntry is DbEntityEntry, the entity with changes we want to replicate       Create audit entity.     DbSet set  this.SetauditTypeInfo.AuditEntityType     IAuditEntity auditEntity  set.Create as IAuditEntity     set.AddauditEntity       Copy the properties.     DbEntityEntry auditEntityEntry  this.EntryauditEntity     foreach string propertyName in auditTypeInfo.AuditProperties               This copies just the raw value, if any         auditEntityEntry.PropertypropertyName.CurrentValue  entityEntry.PropertypropertyName.CurrentValue             ...       return base.SaveChanges  codepre  pSo, following with our example, if we add a Profile record, it gets its ProfileId, but the ProfileVersion record does not.p  pHow in the above code can I have entity framework set that value in the auditentity that we are copying to p

Negative 40130 pI have two tables Company, and Address.p  pUsing bookshelf.js, I need to load address data from address table by using addressid which is a foreign key in Company table, and primary key in Address table along with company data. Following code was meant to do that, but somehow its not working. Its showing address as a blank object in output.

I followed the exact process for getting the withRelated working in my case as well. But seems something still must be wrong.p  pCan anyone please suggest what I need to do to make it workp  pI actually wonder, how Bookshelf.js knows the foreign key name from Company table. We dont specify it anywhere. We only specify the primary key of Address table while defining relation on this statement this.hasOneAddress, addressid.p
Negative 40130 pCurrently I have CASTVariable AS varchar230. p  pI would like to add minimum and maximum precision. For example, the integers to the left of the decimal point in 1234567.89 should have a minimum of 1 but a maximum of five so the extra integers would be trimmed. In addition, Id like to do the same for scale  the decimals to the right, by setting a minimum of two decimal places and a maximum of four. These numbers are just examples, the numbers will be updated dynamically.p  pFrom what Ive read I would have to set precision and scale somehow within typename in CAST, but Im not certain how to do that with multiple minimum and maximum of each.

Negative 40130 pIn Windows, the dynamic loader always looks for modules in the path of the loaded executable first, making it possible to have private libraries without affecting system libraries.p  pThe dynamic loader on Linux only looks for libraries in a fixed path, in the sense that it is independent on the chosen binary.

While waiting for my distro [kubuntu] to upgrade the default compiler, is it possible to have newly compiled application linking to the new runtime, while packaged application still links to the old library, either by static linkage, or something that mimics the Windows behaviorp  pOne way of emulating it would be to create a wrapper scriptp  precodebinbash LDLIBRARYPATHdirname which yourfile yourfile codepre  pAnd after the linking step copy the affected library but it is sort of a hack.p

Negative 40130 pTake a look at how it is possible to output all of the characters from a single byte character set printable or not.

Each byte is evaluated separately and gives the character back for that byte individually. The output string always contains two characters and not one. Since characters in the character set are represented with two bytes you must have to specify them with two bytes rightp  pSo how do you iterate through and print all characters from a double byte character setp

Negative 40130 pI tried setting up public and private keys on two computers clementine amp cfmi so that I can ssh between them without using a password.  However, I am still being requested for a password despite my inclusion of the public key in the authorized keys file under .ssh.  p  pI can log into the cfmi server when I attempt to connect from clementine, however I am prompted for my password.  p  pHowever when I try to connect from the cfmi server to clementine, I am prompted for a password that doesnt  match the root password I have on that computer.  Thus I cant log on from cfmi to clementine. p  pIt gets even more mysterious... The password works just fine when I am sshing from my iphone on the local network.p  pIt may also be relevant that I must first connect to a VPN network using Cisco AnyConnect and only then can I ssh into cfmi since it is firewalled.p  pCan anyone help me figure out how to get the keys to work and how to reset my password to ssh into Clementinep  pHere are the contents amp permissions of the .ssh
