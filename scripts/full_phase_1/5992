Positive 5992 pHopefully this doesnt get too complicated...p  pIve built a thirdparty C library codelibfoocode with both static codelibfoo.acode and shared codelibfoo.socode versions. The object files were created with fPIC. codelibfoocode has several global variables that are used to configure its behavior, and functions that rely on these globals, for simplicity function codefunc1code which interacts with variable codeglobalacode.p  pI have built my C shared library codelibbarcode that Ive statically linked to codelibfoo.acode. This is done without the wholearchive option. So I believe codelibbar.socode includes all the symbols and definitions it needs from codelibfoo.acode. This library calls functions from codelibfoocode which uses global variables to control behavior. In this case, lets say it calls function codefunc1code.p  pFinally, I have a C client program codebazcode that dynamically links to both codelibfoo.socode and codelibbar.socode. This client also uses the same functionsglobal variables from codelibfoocode. It modifies codeglobalacode and calls codefunc1code.p  pIn general, what will be the behavior of the client codebazcode in this scenario Is this sort of configuration something I should avoid, or is it OK And what would happen if codelibfoo.acode and codelibfoo.socode are different versionsp  pFor the global variables I was sort of expecting that the code in codelibbar.socode would use its own copies, and any changes in codebazcode would modify the copies in codelibfoo.socode, but thats not what I see. When codebazcode modifies codeglobalacode, the effect is seen in codelibbar.socode. There wasnt any other abnormal behavior from client codebazcode that I could tell.p  pI also tried linking codebazcode with codelibfoo.acode, and see the same apparently correct behavior.p  pValgrind in either case has no shown any errors.p

Positive 5992 pI am working on a D3 force layout where you can click a node at a time to highlight i.e. change the color of it and its links. If you click the same node again, it unhighlights if and if you click on a different node it unhighlights the first and then highlights the new node. I can think of two ways to do this and I would like to know which way is the best.p  pOption A the way I am currently doing this by having a truefalse clicked data element on each node that is updated every time you click unclick a node. p  pOption B I believe I could also not have any status recorded on the node itself and instead have a clickedNode global variable for the node name that I update and compare things to.p  pAlso, is there a way to create a twoway binding of either of those two options so that if you change it, it automatically changes the styleattr of the related nodesp

Negative 5992 pSo, simple procedure, calculate a factorial number.

However when inputting larger numbers such as 250 it, to put it bluntly, craps out. Now, the first couple factorial bits for 250 are  250, 62250, 15126750, 15438000, 3813186000  for reference.p  pMy code spits out  250, 62250, 15126750, 15438000, strong481781296strong  which is obviously off. My first suspicion was perhaps that I had breached the limit of a 32 bit integer, but given that 232 is 4294967296 I dont think so. The only thing I can think of is perhaps that it breaches a strongsignedstrong 32bit limit, but shouldnt it be able to think about this sort of thing If being signed is the problem I can solve this by making the integer unsigned but this would only be a temporary solution, as the next iteration yields 938043756000 which is far above the 4294967296 limit.p  pSo, is my problem the signed limit If so, what can I do to calculate large numbers Though Ive a LargeInteger class I made a while ago that may be suited without coming across this problem againp

Currently they are included either as references to a codepublic static finalcode, or just plain hardcoded. Id like to encapsulate these constant variables in an object which can be injected into the model, and retrieved by the viewcontroller.p  pTo clarify, the value of the constant variables may not necessarily be defined at compiletime, they could come from reading in a file user input etc. What is known at compile time is emwhichem ones are needed. A way which may be easier to explain it is that whatever this encapsulation is, the values it provides are strongimmutablestrong.p  pIm looking for a way to achieve this which  p  ul lihas compile time typesafety i.e. not mapping a string to variable at runtimeli liavoids anything static including enums, which cant be extendedli ul  pI know I could define an interface which has the methods such as  p  precode public int getMaximumSpeed  public int getMaximumGravity codepre  p... and inject an instance of that into the model, and make it accessible in some way.

Negative 5992 pI am just wondering if Im doign something that might be bad, although it seems a very practical solution to me...p  pI have two forms which the user will have to walk through. The user clicks on a button and form1 pops up. The user presses OK and the second one pops up. The user click OK again and the screens are gone. Or the user clicks on Retry and the screen goes back to the first one. The two screens are completely different sizes with different information.p  pSo I came up with this codep  precode  Form1  TForm1.CreateSharedData   Form2  TForm2.CreateSharedData   repeat     ModalResult  Form1.ShowModal     if ModalResult  mrOK then ModalResult  Form2.ShowModal   until ModalResult ltgt mrRetry   Form1.Release   Form2.Release codepre  pIve tested this code and it seems to work like a charm. In this code, SharedData is an object that contains data thats manipulated by both forms. I create this object before the two forms are created and when ModalResultmrOK I just write the data back to the database.p  pProblem is, while I think this is a clean solution to handle flipping between two forms, I cant remember ever seeing something like this construction before. Of course, Im a Genius. At least, me Ego tells me I am. But would there be something against using this piece of code or is it just finep

Because of some issues documented a hrefhttpsqladvice.comforumspermalink1849622931ShowThread.aspx22931 relnofollowelsewherea we basically do SELECT TOP 2  32 instead of TOP 100 PERCENT.p  pNote we emmustem use the subqueries.p  pHeres our queryp  precodeSELECT  FROM       SELECT [me]., ROWNUMBER OVER ORDER BY SELECT1       AS rnorowindex FROM         SELECT [me].[id], [me].[status] FROM            SELECT TOP 4294967296 [me].[id], [me].[status] FROM            [PurchaseOrders] [me]            LEFT JOIN [POLineItems] [lineitems]            ON [lineitems].[id]  [me].[id]            WHERE  [lineitems].[partid]               ORDER BY [me].[id] ASC         [me]     [me]   rnosubq  WHERE rnorowindex BETWEEN 1 AND 25 codepre  pAre there better ways to do this that anyone can seep  pstrongUPDATEstrong here is some clarification on the whole subquery issuep  pThe key word of my question is procedurally. I need the ability to reliably encapsulate resultsets so that they can be stacked together like building blocks. For example I want to get the first 10 cds ordered by the name of the artist who produced them and also get the related artist for each cd.. What I do is assemble a monolithic subselect representing the cds ordered by the joined artist names, then apply a limit to it, and then join the nested subselects to the artist table and only then execute the resulting query. The isolation is necessary because the code that requests the ordered cds is unrelated and oblivious to the code selecting the top 10 cds which in turn is unrelated and oblivious to the code that requests the related artists.p  pNow you may say that I could move the inner ORDER BY into the OVER clause, but then I break the encapsulation, as I would have to SELECT the columns of the joined table, so I can order by them later. An additional problem would be the merging of two tables under one alias if I have identically named columns in both tables, the select me. would stop right there with an ambiguous column name error.p  pI am willing to sacrifice a bit of the optimizer performance, but the 232 seems like too much of a hack to me. So I am looking for middle ground.p

Negative 5992 pI have a weird behaviour that has only shown up in the last week. I dont use IB, all the controls are created in code.p  pI have a text field with a keyboard active. The first time I load the text field and use the keyboard, everything works normally. The second time I use it, the typed text does not show in the text field. However, the text is in the text field programmatically. For example, I can use it to execute a search. When the keyboard closes, the text appears. p  pSome of my UITextFields have misaligned text. For example, I write hello, and instead of displaying centered inside the field like normal, it displays shifted several pixels downward to the extent that the bottom of the text is cut off. Its almost as if another view is chopping the bottom off the text by obscuring it. p  pI use three20, but according to a hrefhttpgroups.google.comgroupthree20browsethreadthreadd7c4bc1ee2f9590d relnofollowhttpgroups.google.comgroupthree20browsethreadthreadd7c4bc1ee2f9590da, Xcode is suspected of causing the problem.

Negative 5992 pIm writing a pair of applications for distributing audio among other features. I have a WPF program that allows an artist to record and edit audio. Clicking a button then uploads this to a silverlightpowered website. A consumer visiting this website can then listen to the audio. Simple. It works. But Id like it to be better I need an audio format that works seamlessly on both the recording and playback sides. p  pIm currently using mp3 format, and Im not happy with it. For the recordingediting, I use the Alvas Audio c library. It works ok, but for MP3 recording requires that the artist goes into his registry to change msacm.l3acm to l3codecp.acm. Thats a lot to ask of an enduser. Furthermore mp3 recording seems rather fragile when I install on a new machine. Sometimes it randomly just doesnt work until youve fiddled around for a while. I still dont know why. Ive been told that unless I want to pay royalties to the mp3 patent holders, I always need to rely on this type of registry change.p  pSo what other audio format could I use instead I need something compressed. Alvas audio can also record to GSM, for example, but that wont play back in silverlight. Silverlight will play WMA, but I dont know how to record in that format  Alvas Audio wont. Id be open to using another recording library instead, but I havent managed to find one.p  pAm I missing something obvious, or is there really no userfriendly way to record audio in WPF and play it back in Silverlight It seems like there should be...p  pAny suggestions greatly appreciated.p  pThanks.p

I need to keep both the updated version and historical versions of the plan in DB, to see the trend and predict the future.  p  pThe sum of remaining hours of each task is important to draw breakdown chart, you might already see that were using scrum model.

Whenever I make changes to the CommandText, Visual Studio 2008 automagically changes the Parameters to a Collection consisting of one Parameter that existed before editing the Command, immersed in a sea of complete garbage Parameters, and then I either have to undo unless this was the first thing I tried editing, in which case I have to close the Designer to discard changes and reopen it or manually change ALL the Parameters back to something that isnt complete garbage.p  pHas anybody seen anything like this, or know how to stop Visual Studio from murdering my carefully tended Parameters Any way to change the CommandText without finding yet another reason to curse the name of M would be greatly appreciated.p

Negative 5992 pI am developing an app for a client in Europe.  I am an Englishspeaker in the US.  Our app is going to support a number of languages, but not English.  I have all the strings in our app in translated Localized.strings files, set up correctly for the different languages, and they all work fine when the device is set to the correct language devices language is German  app is correctly localized for German.p  pThere is a problem when the device is not set to one of the languages we support, for example, on my phone which is set to English.  We want the phone to fall back to German in cases like this, but that is not happening. What we are seeing is that the phone is using the language that appears highest on the Language list in the International section of Settings.app. For my phone, the highest nonEnglish language on the list is French, so when I run the app, it is localized for French.  If I change my phone to German and then back to English which changes the order in the Languages list, the app then localizes to German.p  pHow can I ensure the app defaults to German for nonsupported languages I used a hrefhttpuseyourloaf.comblog2010510fixingxcodedefaultdevelopmentregion.htmlthis tutoriala to set up the locales for the project.

Negative 5992 pHI,p  p[background] We currently build files for many different companies. Our job as a company is basically to sit in between other companies and help with communication and data storage. We have begun to run in to encoding issues where we are receiving data encoded in one format but we need to send it out in another. All files were prevsiously built using the .net framework default of UTF8. However weve discovered that certain companies cannot read utf8 files. I assume because they have older systems that require something else. This becomes apparent when sending certain french charaters in particular.p  pI have a solution in place where we can build a specific file for a specific member using a specific encoding. While I understand that this may not be enough, unfortunately this is as far as I can go at the moment due to other issues. p  p[problem] Anyways, Im at the testing stage and I want to input utf8 or other characters into management studio. Perform an update on some data and then verify that the file is built correctly from that data. I realize that this is not perfect. Ive already tried programatically reading the file and verifying the encoding by reading preambles etc. So this is what Im stuck with. According to this website a hrefhttpwww.biega.comspecialchar.html relnofollowhttpwww.biega.comspecialchar.htmla ... I can input utf8 characters by clicking ALTampdecimal representation of character or ALTdecimal representation of character but when I use the data specified by the table I get completely different characters in management studio. Ive even saved the file in a utf8 format using management studio by clicking the arrow on the save button in the save dialog and specifying the encoding. So my question is how can I accurately specify a character that will end up being the character Im trying to input and actually put it in the data that will then be put in a file.p  pThanks,p  pKevinp

Negative 5992 pI have a python file in my Django project which contains a custom template tag and a custom template filter. p  pMy custom tag uses codetemplate.loader.gettemplatecode to load another template file.

I can use any other filter inside the template loaded by my custom tag.

Negative 5992 pI want to allow users of an iPhone app to upload photos and use Amazon S3.  There are 2 ways I see going about thisp  ol liUpload from iPhone to my server, which proxies it then to Amazon S3.li liUpload from iPhone direct to S3li ol  pFor option 1, the security is straightforward. I dont ever have to tell the iPhone my S3 secret. Downside is that everything is proxied through our server for uploads which sort of defeats the purpose of going to S3. p  pFor option 2, in theory its better but the issue is how do you enable the iPhone or any mobile app on a different platform to write into my S3 bucket without giving it my secret  Additionally, Im not sure if this is a good design or not because the flow would be iphone uploads to S3, gets the URL, then tells the server what the URL is so it can add it to our database to reference in the future. However, since the communication is separated into 2 legs iphoneS3 vs iPhoneMyServer it leaves it fragile as a nonatomic operation.p  pIve found some older info that references using a hrefhttpdocs.amazonwebservices.comAmazonS320060301devindex.htmlUsingHTTPPOST.htmlBrowserbased Uploads using POSTa but unsure if that is still the recommended approach. Im hoping for a better solution where we can just use the REST APIs rather than relying on POST.  Ive also see the a hrefhttpaws.amazon.comsdkforiosAWS iOS Beta SDKa, but their docs didnt help much and I found an a hrefhttpaws.amazon.comarticles4611615499399490Amazon articlea that was equally unhelpful as it cautions you on what strongnotstrong to do, but doesnt tell you an alternative approachp  blockquote   pThe mobile AWS SDKs sign the API   requests sent to Amazon Web Services   AWS in order to validate the   identity of the AWS account making the   request. Otherwise, a malicious   developer could easily make requests   to another developers infrastructure.   The requests are signed using an AWS   Access Key ID and a Secret Access Key   that AWS provides. The Secret Access   Key is similar to a password, and it   is extremely important to keep secret.p      pTip You can view all your AWS   security credentials, including Access   Key ID and Secret Access Key, on the   AWS web site at   a hrefhttpaws.amazon.comsecuritycredentialshttpaws.amazon.comsecuritycredentialsa.p      pEmbedding credentials in source code   is problematic for software, including   mobile applications, because malicious   users can decompile the software or   view the source code to retrieve the   Secret Access Key.p blockquote  pDoes anyone have any advice on the best architectural design and flow for thisp  pstrongUpdatestrong The more I dig into this, it seems that a bunch of pople recommend using the HTTP POST method with the json policy file as described here a hrefhttpdocs.amazonwebservices.comAmazonS320060301devindex.htmlUsingHTTPPOST.htmlhttpdocs.amazonwebservices.comAmazonS320060301devindex.htmlUsingHTTPPOST.htmla.  p  pWith this, the flow would be something like 1 iPhone makes request to my server, asking for policy file 2 server generates json policy file and gives back to client 3 iPhone does HTTP POST of photo  json policy to S3.  I hate that Im using HTTP POST in an apparently kludgy way but it appears to be better because it removes the need for my server to store the photo at all.p

Negative 5992 pWhenever I look deeply enough into reflector I bump into codeexterncode methods with no source.  I read the msdn documentation at a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibrarye59b22c5vvs.80.aspxhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibrarye59b22c5vvs.80.aspxa.  What I got from that article is that methods with the codeexterncode modifier have to be injected.  I interpreted this to mean it works something like an abstract factory pattern.  I also noticed that Ive never seen a nonstatic extern method.  Is static declaration a requirement I could see how this would make sense   Im still guessing here and Im not sure how it actually works.  It seems to me like the compiler must recognize certain attributes that mitigate processing, but I dont know what the attributes are other than ones Ive come across like codeMethodImplAttributecode and codeDllImportAttributecode from the MSDN example.  How does someone leverage the codeexterncode attribute  It said that in many instances this can increase performance.  Also, how would I go about looking into the source of codeexterncode methods like codeObject.InternalGetEqualscode p

By using, for instance, a dictionary emDictionary.getDictionaryem defined globally in the javascript, I could save the current index in it using the Focus Event in that case.p  pSo, in the key press event, when left would be fired, I would just read the value in the dictionary.p  pI havent tested yet, but I think it should work.p  pstrongSolution 2strong Set the value with the Elementp  precodeElement element  DOM.getElementByIdbutton id A element.ltsetFocusLeftKeygtbutton id [1..3] codepre  pHere what I would like to achieve is just in the onFocus Event, I would simply set the value of that button.p  ul liSo is it possible to castfind the object with the Element I think that if there is no easy way, its probably because its not recommended.li liIs there a simpler wayother method to achieve thatli ul  hr  pSo, any thought or solutions p  pThanks in advance.p  pP.S.

Negative 5992 pI have been reading this paper titled a hrefhttpciteseerx.ist.psu.eduviewdocdownloaddoi10.1.1.70.1272ampreprep1amptypepdf relnofollowClone Detection using Abstract Syntax Treesa by Ira D. Baxter et al. There is a paragraph from the paper that I reproduced belowp  blockquote   pIn principle, finding subtree clones   is easy compare every subtree to   every other subtree for equality. In   practice, several problems arise   nearmiss clone detection, subclones   and scale.    ... p      pWhen locating nearmiss   clones, hashing on complete subtrees   fails precisely because good hashing   functions include all elements of the   tree, and thus sorts tress with minor   differences into different buckets. We   solved this problem by choosing an   strongartificially bad hash functionstrong. This function must be characterized in   such a way that the main properties   one wants to find on nearmiss clones   are preserved. Near miss clones are   usually created by copy and paste   procedures followed by small   modifications. These modifications   usually generate small changes to the   shape of the tree associated with the   copied piece of code. Therefore, we   argue that this kind of nearmiss   clone often have only some different   small subtrees. Based on this   observation, a hash function that   ignores small subtrees is a   goodchoice. strongIn the experiment   presented here, we used a hash   function that ignores only the   identifier names leaves in the tree.   Thus our hashing function puts trees   which are similar modulo identifiers   into the same hash bins for   comparison.strongp blockquote  pI am trying to implement the techniques discussed in this paper but am stuck in trying to understand this one paragraph that is unfortunately at the beginning of the paper. I understand what the paragraph is saying but the authors do not mention what hash function to choose or how to actually hash the ASTs. Can someone please explain this with a simple example from an implementation standpoint p

Loading and linking in the Model seems not possible, because the ORM is not available inside the class or is there a static ressource for fetching the ORM would this be recommended.p  pI could load existing tags and create the tags inside codeControllercode, but i assume tagging should be models work.p  pI am using Symfony2 with Doctrine2.p  pstrongBookmark ClassTablestrongp  precode  ORMTable   ORMEntityrepositoryClassXBookmarksBundleEntityBookmarkRepository   class Bookmark             var integer id             ORMColumnnameid, typeinteger       ORMId       ORMGeneratedValuestrategyAUTO           private id             var string title             ORMColumnnametitle, typestring, length255           private title             var string uri             ORMColumnnameuri, typestring, length255           private uri             var datetime createdat             ORMColumnnamecreatedat, typedatetime           private createdat             var datetime deletedat             ORMColumnnamedeletedat, typedatetime           private deletedat        ORMManyToManytargetEntityTag, cascadepersist, remove      private tags        public function construct              thisgttags  new ArrayCollection           public function getTags           if thisgttagsgtisEmpty              return NO TAGS                    TODO load tags from db         return TODO TAGS FOUND           public function setTags tags           TODO create and loadlink existing tags         tag  new Tag         taggtsetTitletest tag         thisgttagsgtaddtag            setters and getters for other private variables here  codepre  pstrongTag ClassTablestrongp  precode  ORMTable   ORMEntityrepositoryClassXBookmarksBundleEntityTagRepository   class Tag             var integer id             ORMColumnnameid, typeinteger       ORMId       ORMGeneratedValuestrategyAUTO           private id             var string title             ORMColumnnametitle, typestring, length64           private title             var datetime createdat             ORMColumnnamecreatedat, typedatetime           private createdat             var datetime deletedat             ORMColumnnamedeletedat, typedatetime, nullabletrue           private deletedat       public function construct           thisgtcreatedat  new DateTimenow                setters and getters for other private variables here  codepre

Negative 5992 pI have a number of methods that ultimately call my codethis.context.SubmitChangescode method. Because all of my methods operate asynchronously, its possible in my app albiet unlikely that multiple methods might try and submit before another submitchanges is complete.p  pNow, I know I can use the IsSubmitting method to make sure I dont try and call one submit while another is occurring. Im just wondering which direction to go from here. Im not sure its really necessary to to set up a queue, since multiple entities looking to submit changes will all get rolled up under a .SubmitChanges call. p  pI have a callback function on each of the submitchanges that I make.

Negative 5992 pI know this is rather a trivial question but anyhow I want to know if it is solvable.p  pI have an ASP.NET webform page with a nested masterpage and JavaScript includes. I make extensive use of jQuery and Ajax calls. Once a page is loaded, all communication with the server is done with Ajax calls, so I dont need ViewState enabled, and this is resulting in a reduced HTML output code.p  pI now have to implement a page where a user can upload a file. So I used the AsyncFileUpload control of AjaxToolkitFileUpload. Once a file is uploaded, I do a Ajax call to the server to request the filename.p  pIt all works fine but I noticed that FireBug found 10 errors per file upload between the OnClientUploadStarted and the OnClientUploadComplete events. The file is uploaded properly and the events on the client side are working too. But I cant ignore the fact that there are errors thrown so I went looking for the problem.p  pI rebuild the page piece by piece and I found out that this control needs the Viewstate enabled. However with emviewstatedisabledem in the page directive the file size is 76.6kb, and with emviewstateenabledem the size is 99.2kb. p  pAgain, I know it is trivial and will not affect performance on the site, but it is a nice to know. br  Why does this control needs the viewstate I suppose because it actually post the file to a iFrame or something like thatbr  How can I reduce the viewstate and let this control still work properly  p

Negative 5992 pBasically, what Im trying to do is use a map viewer as an image viewer with the same sort of efficient tileloading, zoompan awesomeness without having to build it myself.p  pSpecifically, I need an image viewer that will allow the image to grow and change while not altering the coordinates of any older unchanged tiles. This means that the center point 0,0, where the image started growing from, must always remain 0,0. So Im looking for a library that will allow me to use a very basic Cartesian coordinate system no map projection, which will ask for tiles infinitely in all directions with no repetition as opposed to how map libraries just ignore yaxis above and below the map, but the x axis repeats.p  pTheres another catch. I need zoom level 0 to be zoomed eminem all the way. Since the image is constantly growing, theres no way to tell what the max zoom level will be, and the coordinates need to be based on the base image layer tiles so that every tile in zoom level z contains 2z base layer tiles.p  pI am wondering if this is possible with OpenLayers and how to do it. If its not, any suggestions of other opensource javascript libraries that can do this would be very appreciated Ive tried playing around with a hrefhttppolymaps.org relnofollowPolymapsa, but the documentation is lacking too much for me to be able to tell if it will work. So far no luck.p  pPlease let me know if none of this made sense, and Ill try to include some images or better explanations. Thanks p

Negative 5992 pwere trying to improve our Jenkins setup. So far we have two directories plugins and tests.p  pOur project is a multimodule project of Eclipse Plugins. The test plugins in the tests folder are fragment projects dependent on their corresponding productive code plugins in plugins.p  pUntil now, we had just one Jenkins job which checked out both plugins and tests, built all of them and produced the Surefire results etc.p  pWere now thinking about splitting the project into smaller jobs corresponding to features we provide. It seems that the way we tried to do it is suboptimal.p  pWe tried the followingp  ol liWe created a job for the core feature. This job checks out the whole plugins and tests directories and only builds the plugins the feature is comprised of. This job has a separate pom.xml which defines the core artifact and tells about the modules contained in the feature. li liWe created a separate job for the tests that should be run on the feature plugins. This job uses the cloned workspace from the core job. This job is to be run after the core feature is built.li ol  pI somehow think this is less than optimal.p  ul liFor instance, only the core job can update the checked out files. If only the tests are updated, the core feature does not need to be built again, but it will be.li liAs soon as I have a feature which is dependent on the core feature, this feature would either need to use a clone of the core feature workspace or check out its own copy of plugins and tests, which would lead to bloat.li liUsing a cloned workspace, I cant update my sources. So when I have a feature depending on another feature, I can only do the job if the core feature is updated and built.li ul  pI think Im missing some basic stuff here. Can someone help There definitely is an easier way for this.p  pEDIT Ill try to formulate what I think would ideally happen if everything worksp  ul licheck if the feature components have changed i.e. an update on them is possibleli liif changed, build the feature ul liBuild the dependent features, if necessary i.e. check ob corresponding jobli liBuild the feature itselfli liif build successful, start feature test jobli lilet me see the results of the test job in the feature jobli ulli ul  pFinally, the project job shouldp  ul lido a nightly buildli licheck out all sources from plugins and testsli libuild all, test all, send results to Sonarli ul  pAdditionally, it would be neat if the nightly build was unnecessary because the builds and test results of the projects features would be combined in the project job results.p  pIs something like this possiblep

Isnt the ClickOnce installer tech smart enough to figure out whether the user needs the x86 or 64bit version of the C redistributable  And if a newer version is installed, is that really a show stopperp  pThis all seems very brittle and it seems as though there should be a very simple fix for it.p

I have also come across Cocoas2d Denshion for handling audio at low latency.p  pThis a hrefhttpwww.tricedesigns.com20120125lowlatencypolyphonicaudioinphonegaparticlea states that HTML5 is terrible for audio playback especially polyphony. He goes on to state that Phonegaps Media class works nicely and by using the native plugin model you can create a low latency solution with Phonegapp  pIf you were to choose an API which would you choose to create a low latency audio based game and why If you have a different suggestion than the ones mentioned please describe and why.

Negative 5992 pI am working on a VB6 project. There are a few methods I want to make obsolete. After removing the method body, the idea is to raise a standard COM error, e.g.p  precodeErr.Raise ENOTIMPL codepre  pIn this case, I am using the standard Method not implemented error, but that isnt really the right message I want returned.p  pAny ideasp
Negative 5992 pThis might be a tricky one that I would like to solve somehow. The company I previously was working for went bankrupt. And during the chaos, a lot of users took their company computers and left. p  pNow, what they dont know is that weve installed UAG on each computer. A silent VPN solution that communicates with the domain controller and authenticates through the computer account in AD. p  pSo, what I would like to do is to run a script of some sort that tries to contact each computer and collect the username logged on to that computer. That would give me an easy way of determining if that computer is used by someone who isnt working in the company that bought the bankrupt resources. p  pIve already run dsquery to find inactive computers from the past 8 weeks. Comparing that list to the whole list of computers gave me a pretty good idea of the computers that are currently in use. How should I go about doing thisp
Negative 5992 pWould it be possible to just label the x axis by the minimum value and the maximum value instead of having values inbetweenp  pMore info on what Im graphing I have a large dataset of dates that I am graphing. Currently I am scaling it to a scale of 0100 to graph it. I just want to label 0 as the lowest date and 100 as the highest date.p
Negative 5992 pIn my web app, all date values are converted to UTC before being passed into the SQL database and then converted back to local time whenever they are displayed in the app. So the bottom line is that all dates are in UTC in the database.p  pThat worked just fine until I started report development. Crystal Reports has no ability that I can detect to do a time zone conversion so I need to do the conversion within SQL before passing the value to the report.  p  pSQL Server appears to have a much more limited ability to convert datetime values. The only function I see is codeSWITCHOFFSETcode. The problem with this function is that it is not daylightsavings aware which seems to be a major flaw.  In asp.net, I can pass a datetime value with a time zone and it will automatically convert it to UTC time, taking account of any needed daylight savings time adjustments.  p  pIn SQL though, instead of saying something like codeSWITCHOFFSET SomeDate,Eastern Timecode,br I now have to say codeSWITCHOFFSETSomeDate, 400code.  But what happens if Im pulling data from a table and I ask for all of the data for March, the month when daylight savings starts No matter what, some of it will be incorrect.  I can either say 400 or 500 but obviously, not both.p  pIs there some other function to adjust for this as, frankly, it seems codeSWITCHOFFSETcode is half baked if it doesnt know how to do a daylight savings conversion.p

Negative 5992 pSuppose you have a layered project divided into the Presentation Layer, the Business Layer and the Data Access Layer. If you were using CQRS, you would be doing queries directly from the Data Access Layer into the Presentation Layer and bypassing the Business Layer. p  pIn that case, if you are using ViewModels in your presentation layer, then your Data Access Layer would need reference to the Presentation Layer to return data in terms of the ViewModels in the presentation layer.

Negative 5992 pThis question is partly answered in a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions3772864howdoiremoveleadingwhitespacecharsfromrubyheredocHow do I remove leading whitespace chars from Ruby HEREDOCap  pIn Rails 3 there is a method codestripheredoccode, that strips all whitespace. But when inserting lines in an existing file, that already has identation, this doesnt work too well. An examplep  precodebegin   insertintofile appnameconfigenvironmentsproduction.rb, ltltDEVISEMAILERSTUFF.stripheredoc, before gt endn      for devise     config.actionmailer.defaulturloptions   protocol gt https, host gt YOURHOSTNAME      config.actionmailer.deliverymethod  smtp     something.each do x       do stuff     end   DEVISEMAILERSTUFF end codepre  pThe begin and end are only added to show that the source code has indentation. The heredoc has 4 spaces before the line  for devise. stripheredoc will delete all these spaces, but it will maintain the two extra spaces in the line do stuff.p  pIn codeenvironmentsproduction.rbcode this will look like thisp  precodeMyAppApplication.configure do    Settings specified here will take precedence over those in configapplication.rb     Identation here is two spaces We are in a block.    for devise config.actionmailer.defaulturloptions   protocol gt https, host gt YOURHOSTNAME  config.actionmailer.deliverymethod  smtp something.each do x   do stuff end     back to original identation of this file end  MyAppApplication.configure block codepre  pHow to solve this  Maybe there are other ways instead of a heredoc I thought maybe codestripheredocmincode where codemincode is the minimum of spaces to keep, but that doesnt work well with tabs I guess. Or have the first line of the heredoc determine the left margin, like thisp  precodeputs ltltHEREDOC   FIRSTLINE     Real code here HEREDOC codepre  pThat FIRSTLINE would be deleted by codestripheredoccode, but it would also set the number of spaceswhitespace that needs to be deleted. So the output would have 2 spaces in front of Real code here.p  pstrongUpdatestrong Maybe something like thisp  precodeString.classeval do   def stripheredocwithindentindent0     newindent   self.empty  0   scan[ t]S.min.size  indent       gsub[ t]newindent,    end end codepre

I have tried to change the LPC1768.ld script, changing the ORIGIN of the FLASH to 0x10000, but it seems that it is not doing anything. p  precodeMEMORY    FLASH rx  ORIGIN  0x00010000, LENGTH  0x70000   RAM rwx  ORIGIN  0x100000C8, LENGTH  0x7F38    USBRAMrwx  ORIGIN  0x2007C000, LENGTH  16K   ETHRAMrwx  ORIGIN  0x20080000, LENGTH  16K  codepre  pIs there an option in the Makefile or somewhere else that will help changing the start address of the program, so it can run correctly when I jump from my bootloader to adress 0x10000 p  pstrongEDITstrongp  pI think I understand what I need to achieve thanks to the couple of responses but for some reasons I cant get it working. Mbed does not export the startupLPC17xx.s file so I tried to use the one from CMSIS, but no luck with that. I am wondering if I actually need to change the startup code as the process is as followp  ul liBootloader runs at 0x0000li liBootloader will do some checks and eventually will run the userapp sitting at 0x10000. The bootloader actually moves the vector table before jumping to 0x10000. This userapp is the one I am trying to build with gcc and will not be running at powerup, only be running after the bootloader has started itself. Not sure if thats clear but I would think that only changing the Linker script would work... but it isnt.li ul  pDetails of the Linker script where I have changed this section address to 0x10000p  blockquote   pSECTIONS p blockquote  precode.text        startupLPC17xx.o      KEEP.isrvector     .text      KEEP.init     KEEP.fini       .ctors      crtbegin.o.ctors     crtbegin.o.ctors     EXCLUDEFILEcrtend.o crtend.o .ctors     SORT.ctors.     .ctors       .dtors      crtbegin.o.dtors     crtbegin.o.dtors     EXCLUDEFILEcrtend.o crtend.o .dtors     SORT.dtors.     .dtors      .rodata      KEEP.ehframe  gt FLASH  .ARM.extab  etc.. codepre  pstrongEDIT2strong I have added startupLPC17xx.o in my script, this seems to be working fine now p

Here, Im going to use the codequerybuildercode param to return only entities that matches a longcomplex query see the example in the a hrefhttpsymfony.comdoccurrentreferenceformstypesentity.htmlusingacustomqueryfortheentities relnofollowofficial docsa.p  pObviously the codequerybuildercode param for the entity field type accepts a Doctrine emQueryBuilderem object. On the other side, I have large entity repositories with complex DQL queries obtained by the emEntityManagerems codecreateQuerycode function which returns a Doctrine emQueryem object.  So, I cannot directly use all these queries in the entity field type. Moreover, rewriting all the queries for the use with a QueryBuilder would be a nonsense.p  pIs there such a way to automatically translate from the emQueryem object to the emQueryBuilderem objectp

Negative 5992 pI am trying to understand how virtualization was performed in the past using shadow page tables. The a hrefhttpwww.anandtech.comshow248010 relnofollowarticlesa Ive read all talk about about the translation from Guest Virtual Memory to Host Physical Memory.  I understand how the Shadow Page tables eliminate the need for a Guest Virtual to Guest Physical Translation. My question is, what happened to the Host Virtual to Host Physical step. HVA  HPA. p  pDo the Virtual Machine Managers in the cited articles, not use virtual memory in the host at all Are they assumed to have direct access to the Physical memory of the host system Is it even possible I thought the TLB cache translation is implemented in hardware by the MMU and and every instructions addresses are translated from virtual to physical by the MMU itself. But then again, I am not sure how kernel code works with TLB Do kernel instructions not go through TLB p

I need to receive a notification whenever a row is added  modified  deleted in the view. Using postgresql 9.2 I first though about the new feature triggers on view, introduced in pg 9.1. However this doesnt do what I need, since this feature only offers a trigger that is fired when an insertupdatedelete is performed directly on the view.p  pLong story short I need something triggers or else that, looking directly on the view, will notify me when my view is updated I mean indirectly when one of the tables which composes the view is modified.

Negative 5992 pi wanted to throw an alert when session expires and when you press ok button in the alert box then it will take you to login page. For this i thought to create a timer and timertask and in the run method of the later class i will check if the session exists or not. So for this i tried to create a class in jsp page but it is showing error. i can create in servlet but all my pages are in jsp and so this idea is not useful.Now i created a sessionlistner and in the session destroyed method i want to link to login page but i have a problem here too.I can not use response method in the sessiondestroyed method.Please tell me are there any other waysp

Negative 5992 pThis is a semanticoptimization problem Ive been working on over the past couple days, and Im stuck. My real program runs on a RTOS FreeRTOS, specifically, and I need to spawn tasks which are simplified, nonterminating versions of threads. The C API takes a codevoid voidcode for the tasks entry point, and a codevoidcode parameter. Pretty standard fare.p  pIve written a wrapper class for a task, and rather than doing one of the oldschool implementations such as having a virtual method that must be overridden by the final task class, I would rather get C to generate the necessary parameterstorage object and glue functions by means of variadic templates and functions.p  pIve done this with lambdas and codestdfunctioncode and codestdbindcode already, but they seem to implement some bloat, namely by not resolving the function target until runtime. Basically the same mechanism as a virtual method would use. Im trying to cut out all the overhead I can, if possible. The bloat has been coming out to about 200 bytes per instance more than the hardcoded implementation. This is on an ARM CortexM3 with 128K total flash, and weve only got about 500 bytes left. All of the SO questions Ive found on the topic similarly defer resolution of the function until runtime.p  pThe idea is for the code top  ol liStore the decayed versions of the variadic arguments in an object allocated on the heap this is a simplification an Allocator could be used instead, and pass this as the codevoidcode parameter,li liPass a generated callisland function as the entry point, with signature codevoidvoidcode, that calls the target function with the stored parameters, andli liThis is the part I cant figure out have the compiler deduce the types of the argument list from the target functions signature, to follow the emDont Repeat Yourselfem principle.li liNote that strongthe function pointer and its argument types are known and resolved at compile time,strong and the actual strongargument values passed to the function are not known until runtimestrong because they include things like object pointers and runtime configuration options.li ol  pIn the example below, I have to instantiate one of the tasks as codeTaskltvoid int, bar, intgt taskbar100code when strongI would rather write codeTaskltbargt taskbar100code or codeTask taskbarltbargt100codestrong and have the compiler figure out or somehow tell it in the library that the variadic arguments have to match the argument list of the specified function.p  pThe obvious answer would be some kind of template signature like codetemplatelttypename... Args, void FunctionArgs...gtcode but, needless to say, that does not compile. Nor does the case where codeFunctioncode is the first argument.p  pIm not sure this is even possible, so Im asking here to see what you guys come up with. Ive omitted the variant code that targets object methods instead of static functions in order to simplify the question.p  pThe following is a representative test case. Im building it with gcc 4.7.3 and the codestdgnu11code flag.p  precodeinclude ltutilitygt include ltiostreamgt using namespace std  void foo  cout ltlt foon  void barint val  cout ltlt bar ltlt val ltlt n   templatelttypename Callable, Callable Target, typename...

If a method by which I can antialias the image while it is being drawn is possible, please post it here.p  pHeres the codep  precodeimport Image, ImageDraw from collections import Counter  def avgcolorarr     r,g,b  0,0,0     for item in arr         r  item[0]         g  item[1]         b  item[2]     l  lenarr     return rl,gl,bl  COLORNUMBER  12  PATH  test.png  COLORS  [ 255,255,255, 0,0,0 ]  im  Image.openPATH rgbim  im.convertRGB  size  rgbim.size  nim  Image.newRGB, size draw  ImageDraw.Drawnim  for i in rangeCOLORNUMBER2     devs  [[765 for j in rangesize[1]] for k in rangesize[0]]     cols  [[765 for j in rangesize[1]] for k in rangesize[0]]     ind  []     for x in rangesize[0]         for y in rangesize[1]             r,g,b  rgbim.getpixelx,y             cols[x][y]  r,g,b             for c in COLORS                 diff  absc[0]rabsc[1]gabsc[2]b                 devs[x][y]  mindiff,devs[x][y]      h  0,0     for x in rangesize[0]         for y in rangesize[1]             if devs[x][y] gt devs[h[0]][h[1]]                 h  x,y     print Added color,cols[h[0]][h[1]]     COLORS.appendcols[h[0]][h[1]]    printCreated palette. printCOLORS  for x in rangesize[0]     for y in rangesize[1]         r,g,b  rgbim.getpixelx,y         devarray  []         col  COLORS[0]         for c in COLORS             diff  absc[0]rabsc[1]gabsc[2]b             devarray.appenddiff         smallest  0         for i in rangelendevarray             if devarray[i] lt devarray[smallest]                 smallest  i         col  COLORS[smallest]         draw.pointx,y,fillcol  print Finished rough image.   nim.show codepre

I have lots of these kinds of cell that need to work this way, so can somebody please help mep  pAll help is appreciated.p
Negative 5992 pI have a new project in github. It is public. However I dont remember being asked what license to give it.p  pIn google code  sourceforge before starting a new repository I recall being asked to commit to an open source license.p  pOf course there is a difference between public and open source. Can I say, for example, you are free to download, read, and study the code but you have to pay  for running it Or you cannot fork it Or whatever nonopensourcecompatibleclauseherep
Negative 5992 pSorry with my English.p  pI am developing my application about area detection. I want to detect the position of android device via GPS, when it on the Polyline,it will alert the user. So I want to keep the Polyline in Local Storage. p  pBut I do not know how to keep itp  pMy solution isp  ul liI keep the start and end pointlatitude,longitude in my database and then I will send the argument to maps.google.com and access the node then writing the Document and create Polyline from the documentli ul  pMistake  It can not run after click Risk Zone It show only marker on the map but do not show the Polyline. And It will crash.p  pMainActivityp  precodeimport java.io.IOException import java.io.InputStream import java.util.ArrayList  import javax.xml.parsers.DocumentBuilder import

Negative 5992 pI am working on Mac OSX and using bash as my shell. I currently have a string which I wish want evaluated as a number. When I echo the string I get code1.e81.07100code. Is there any way to pass this string on to be evaluated as a numberp  pThe background as to why it is a string to start with is because the expression was built step by step. First code1.e81.07dcode is within the code, then the user inputs an integer to be taken as what 1.07 will be raised to the power of. So in the example above, the user would have input 100, and thus the script is stuck with code1.e81.07100code, which is the correct expression I was hoping for, but I would have liked it to be evaluated when I echo the variable where it is store.p  pActual important bits of codep  precodeBASEprintf 1.e81.07d Get user input assigned to pow NUMprintf BASE pow echo NUM       1.e81.07100 codepre  pThanks for any help you can offer.p  p[Edit I would also like to not just echo the answer, but store it as a variable.]p

Negative 5992 pI have a rails server that Im trying to run tests against using RSpec, Capybara, and Selenium on a mac.  I have a command line program that incorporates the library that performs iOS calls and am attempting to call said program during testing.  Problem is, as far as the controller is concerned, the appropriate table in the database is empty, even after a save call.p  pSo the test looks likep  precodeletdevice FactoryGirl.createdevice before do   puts Device.count   Capybara.currentdriver  selenium otherwise, never even asks for the controller   Capybara.currentsession.mode not sure why this is necessary, but it appears that without this line, the test fails.  Looks like a timing issue.   device.save created by the previous let call via FactoryGirl   puts Device.count spits out a count of 1, the device object   transactions  Transaction.count    systemnetworkTester, serverURL, device.id, device.password end it should give an expected response do   response.status.should eq200 response is empty   json  JSON.parseresponse.body   Transaction.count.should be transactions  2 end codepre  pInside the devices controller, Ive added the debugging code p  precodeputs params device  Device.[matching criteria].first puts device puts Device.count codepre  pThe idea being that I should be able to see the appropriate parameters I do, and that the device count should be nonzero it isnt its always zero.p  pI have to use selenium for this if I leave the driver at racktest, then the command line function never gets called ie, that codeputs paramscode line never gets called.  I also have to call codeCapybara.currentsession.mode code for the same reason ie, without that, the controller never seems to get called I figured that out through codeputscodebased debugging.p  pThe test result itself, at this point, looks likep  precodeRackFile headers parameter replaces cachecontrol after Rack 1.5. Run options include focusgttrue 0 1 authcheckgtnil, ....  0 20130705 175842.788 NetworkTester[893707] Not Authorized. codepre  pThat first zero is the first codeputs Device.countcode, the code1code is the result of codeputs Device.countcode after codedevice.savecode is called.  The codecode is the params puts from inside the controller, then a blank line for codeputs devicecode, and code0code for the count of the codeDevicecode table.  As far as I can tell, that means that in the controller, the codeDevicecode table is empty however, from the testing side, the codeDevicecode table has one entry.  Because theres nothing in the database as far as the controller is concerned, the NetworkTester fails.p  pIf I run the code outside of the testing environment, the output looks more reasonable ie, the codeDevicecode table has contents, as far as the controller is concerned.  p  pSo why would the codeDevicecode table either have no entries or have one entry during testing  More importantly, how can I get the codeDevicecode table to have contents during the entire course of the testp  pThis is Rails 3.2.13, RSpec core of 2.13.1, rspecrails at 2.13.2, capybara 2.0.3, and seleniumwebdriver 2.33.0.  I can provide other versions if necessary.p

The border should just fade when nothing is hovered. Im not very experienced with jQuery to do this, so Im asking anyone who may have ideas, to try and explain it as simple as possible. I have tried searching for a couple days on this animation to no avail. If this is also possible in pure CSS, that would also be great, but Im not sure it is because it depends on the movement of the cursor. Thanks to everyone in advance.p

Negative 5992 pI am in process of migrating existing jspservletportletjetspeed based application to spring. Me and my colleague are the only developers to design, code, deploy and maintain applications The reason i listed duties is not to show off but rather to explain my responsibility and impact of my actions. Wanted to be wary of my initial application design amp architecture before it is too late to realize. The existing web application is already being used worldwide. I have encountered few questions while designing new application.p  p1 Number of webapps to squeeze the application into Currently, i have 5 webapps. If required, all of these can be clubbed into one webapp that helps to avoid additional coding to share data between them upon migrating to spring. However, do not want to compromise on the scalability amp maintenance. For an instance, do not want to deploy whole war file for a single class change. My question What are the factors that need to be considered while designing and chosing one vs more than one webappsp  p2 Data sharing between webapps In case of having more than one webapp, data need to be shared. I am thinking of the solution that is less abstract. I am comparatively new to spring and currently share data between webapps by filters amp request objects between two contexts. Was able to find couple of posts like  a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions10339174howdoyousharespringbeansbetweendifferentspringcontextsHow do you share Spring beans between different Spring contextsa but do not want to end up in too much of abstraction until i am aware of spring. But, again i realize that comparatively its difficult to implement changes at the later stages of project. My Question Any other ways of sharing data between different spring contexts with less abstraction p  p3 Version of spring to use. Sure the latest due to its features but wanted to chose the one that has more community support. I do not see in near future that i need to use all the advanced features of spring in latest releases.p  p4 View I am planning to use JSTL as a presentation layer by converting existing JSPs  as i have worked on it a bit and are straightless abstraction. My Question Any other technology other than JSTL like JSF and your suggestions for JSTL. p  pThanks for your time.p

Negative 5992 pI have spent nearly 2 days now trying to get these damn tax rules to work in Magento.p  pI have a product. I have one Product Tax Class. I have one Customer Group. I have one Tax Zone UK  20. I have one Tax Rule for this zone, Product Tax Class and Customer Group.p  pThe tax settings are as followsp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comAuThn.png altMagento Tax Settingsp  pWhen I add a product to my cart, the product price is 695. The Cart totals are as followsp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comE1p0T.png altMagento Shopping Cart Totalsp  pThis is clearly wrong. If the product price is 695 and Ive specified that this price is excluding tax, then 20 should be added to this cost. At the very least, the two Grand Total costs should be differentp  pThe two very last things Ive done were to delete the cache manually via FTP and to reindex all the indexes.p
Negative 5992 pThis is a rather general question about TCP sockets. I got a clientserver application setup where messages are sent over the wire via TCP. The implementation is done via C POCO, however the question is not related to a certain technology.p  pA message can be a request initiated by the client or a response initiated by the server.p  pA request has the structurep  precodeMessage Header Request Header Parameters codepre  pA response has the structurep  precodeMessage Header Response Header Parameters codepre  pI know TCP guarantees that sent packages will be delivered in the order they have been sent. However, nothing can be assumed about the timespan a delivery might need.p  pOn both sides I have a readsend timeout configured. Now I wonder how to have a clean set up on the transmitted data after a timeout. Dont know how to express this in the right terms, so let me describe an examplep  ol liServer S sends a response to the client Message Header, Response Header, Parameters are put into the streamli liClient C receives the message header partially e.g. the first 4 bytes of 12li liAfter these 4 bytes have been received, the reception timeout occursli liOn clientside, an appropriate exception is thrown, the reception will be stopped.li liThe client considers the package as invalid.li ol  pNow the problem is, when the client tries to receive another package, he might receive the lasting part of the old response message header. From the point of view of the currently processed transaction send requestget response, the client receives garbage.p  pSo it seems that after a timeout has occured no matter whether it has been on client or serverside, the communication should continue with a clean setup, meaning that none of the communication partners will try to send some old package data and that no old package data is stored within the stream buffer of the respective socket.p  pSo how are such situations commonly handled Is there some kind of design pattern  idiomatic way to solve this How are such situations handled within other TCPbased protocols, e.g. HTTPp  pIn all the TCP samples around the net Ive never seen an implementation that deals with those kind of problems...p  pThank you in advancep

Negative 5992 pI have a problem with a transition on my app. I have a menu view controller which is the root view. I have have a overview controller which is the main controller offering options for users to move through the application. The overview controller has a button which slides the view to the right to display the menu controller behind it. the problem I have is that when the app launches i set the root view to the menu controller and then place the overview on top of that and when the app launches it flashes the menu controller before place the overview on top of it. My question is, is there any way to get rid of that flash so can i push the overview on top of the menu before it appears or show the overview and then add the menu underneath itp  pThanks in advance for the help.p

Negative 5992 pIm playing around with Java Swing and im really confused when comes to JPanel vs JComponent. According to CoreJava Vol 1 cay horstmannp  blockquote   pInstead of extending JComponent, some programmers prefer to extend the   JPanel class. A JPanel is intended to be a container that can contain   other components, but it is also possible to paint on it. There is   just one difference. A panel is opaque, which  means that it is   responsible for painting all pixels within its bounds. The easiest    way to achieve that is to paint the panel with the background color,   by calling  super.paintComponent in the paintComponent method of each   panel subclassp blockquote  precodeclass NotHelloWorldPanel extends JPanel    public void paintComponentGraphics g      super.paintComponentg     . . .  code for drawing will go here     codepre  pI know what opaque is.

Negative 5992 pPlease keep in mind I have very little experience with any of this stuff.p  pIve been trying to set up a multiserver Magento site in Elastic Beanstalk, using RDS as the database and EC2s for the separate admin and frontend servers. I was testing the speed of a few different setups on tools.pingdom.com, mostly looking at what they call wait DNS, connect, send, WAIT, receive, assuming that is a rough measure of how long it takes for Magento to generate the html for a page. I was puzzled by how on different setups, the wait time could vary so dramatically for creating roughly the same page using similar server instances. I was getting values between 980ms and 1.8s.p  pI thought I started to notice a pattern. It seemed that the setups in which the EC2s were in the same availability zones as the RDS instances would be faster and more consistently faster. So I changed the elastic beanstalk configurations so that the EC2s would be in the same zone as the database. My unscientific findings were that I would consistently get wait times of around 1s after this change. It seems to me that the fairly significant differences in speed were due to network latency between the application server and the database.p  pThere are three parts to my question. First, is this what one would expect from keeping instances in the same zones, or am I reading too much into a small set of test results Second, is this a significant real world difference in speed Because it seems to be to me, and it also seems that it would only be made worse by using things like NFS to share the media folders. Third, are there any advantages to allowing application servers to be launched in different zones, and are those advantages worth the increase in wait timep  pAlso, if Im doing something wrong, please tell me.p

Negative 5992 pIm trying to solve the following exercisetaken from The Algorithm Design Manualp  blockquote   pWe wish to compute the laziest way to dial given ndigit number on a standard pushbutton telephone using two fingers. We assume that the two fingers start out on the  and  keys, and that the effort required to move a finger from one button to another is proportional to the Euclidean distance between them. Design an algorithm that computes the method of dialing that involves moving your fingers the smallest amount of total distance, where k is the number of distinct keys on the keypad k  16 for standard telephones. Try to use Onk3 timep blockquote  pFor starters, Let  codedd1.d2....dn be the ndigit sequencecodep  pThe algo that Ive come up uses two 2ddimensionalnxk Arrays L,R withp  precode L[a][b]min cost to type the d[a]digit with  the left finger and having    the right finger at button b   R[a][b]same thing but with right and left instead. codepre  pIn order to fill these two arrays, i  use two almost identical  recurrence functionsas such ill  only post the one for Lp  pAt first,p  precode L[a1][b]L[a][b]costfromd[a]tod[a1] codepre  pThat is, we keep the right finger at button and we move the left finger from d[a] to d[a1]p  pThen, if bd[a]i.e last digit dialed with right, then other proper ways  also exist in order to type d[a1] with the left finger by keeping the right finger on the d[a] button as it is and moving the left finger to d[a1] from wherever it is.p  precode  L[a1][b]minL[a1][b],minR[a][c]costfromctod[a1],  codepre  pFor this, i first find the minimum cost so that we dial d[a1]  with left  having dialed d[a] with  the right. Then i compare it with the  value from the upper bullet and keep the minimum.p  pAfter filling the arrays, the minimum cost can be found by simply finding the minimum LR[n][whatever]p  pTo me, this code seems correct. However, given that  the time complexity is only Onk as opposed to Onk3,  i have certainly made some errors...p  pDoes anyone have a clue as to where do these errors liep
Negative 5992 pI came across a bug a few weeks back in Android where by if you position a canvas element on the Native Android Browser WebKit 534.4 using css positioning codepositionabsolute top10px left100pxcode the duplicated Canvas Apparently android uses one for GPU acceleration is rendered to the browser ignoring the positioning.p  pSo if I have a canvas at position codetop100px left100pxcode I would have my canvas in position perfectly, but the GPU accleration canvas would be ignoring it and will sit in the top left corner see images from my previous question p  pa hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions18271990androidnativebrowserduplicatinghtml5canvasfineinchromeAndroid Native Browser duplicating HTML5 canvas fine in chromeap  pI found a solution, which was to use CSS translate instead, like this codetransform translate100px, 100pxcode this now fixes the issue as the GPU accleration canvas is rendered in the same place so it doesnt appear duplicated....p  pBUT as a knock on effect I now have a clicking bug.p  pAs im centering the canvas, when the window width is smaller than the device width the X position will be a negative value, the only clickable area of the canvas when this has happened is what would be displayed without the positioning.p  pThis is hard to explain but hopefully this image will make it clearerp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comtHuHt.jpg altClick Bugp  pI think its an issue with the browser itself as even when I have this code the alert doesnt fire from half of the screenp  pcodecanvas.addEventListenerclick, functione  alertclick codep  hr  pIm guessing that CSS position top and left use the CPU to move the canvas so the GPU generated one is in the wrong place, but CSS translate uses the GPU to move the canvas so the GPU generated one is correctly positioned but the CPU is reading mouse events without this offset........AHHHHHp  hr  pEDIT after testing on more devices I can confirm that this appears to be an issue with browsers using a version of webkit under 535 as this issue appears on most Android Native browsers and Safari on iOS5p

Negative 5992 pHere is a very simple test program. When vsync is disabled this program runs at 100FPS and uses up virtually 0 of the CPU. When I enable vsync, I get 60FPS and 25 100 of one core on a 4 core system CPU utilization. This is using a Nvidia GPU. Searching online lead me to the suggestion to disable multithreaded optimization inside of Nvidia control panel. This does decrease the CPU utilization, but only to 10. Furthermore, if I remove the call to sleep after SwapBuffers, I get 25 utilization again even with multithreaded optimization disabled.

Negative 5992 pI have a legacy a hrefhttpsdeveloper.android.comreferenceandroidappIntentService.htmlcodeIntentServicecodea that attempts to use Toast messages to display error messages.sup1sup  Id like the messages to be displayed, and have added code to get them on the correct thread.  The simplest change would be to pass in the constructed a hrefhttpsdeveloper.android.comreferenceandroidwidgetToast.htmlcodeToastcodea object and then display it on the UI thread.  However, strongthe Toast only displays if I emmakeem it in the posted runnable, not if I pass in a premade codeToastcodestrong.p  pThis worksp  precodeOverride protected void onHandleIntentIntent intent      showToastError, Toast.LENGTHLONG   private void showToastfinal String msg, final int duration      new HandlergetMainLooper.postnew Runnable          Override         public void run               Make and show the toast in the posted runnable             Toast.makeTextgetApplicationContext, msg, duration.show                codepre  pThis strongdoesnt workstrongp  precodeOverride protected void onHandleIntentIntent intent       Make the toast here     Toast myToast  Toast.makeTextgetApplicationContext, Error, Toast.LENGTHLONG     showToastmyToast   private void showToastfinal Toast toast      new HandlergetMainLooper.postnew Runnable          Override         public void run               Show the toast here             toast.show                codepre  pIn both cases, the context is the application context, and I didnt see anything in the source that would cause one version to work, but the other not.  Instead the latter has the same problems as if the Toast was shown directly in the IntentService Handler android.os.Handler ... sending message to a Handler on a dead thread, Toast not disappearing, etc.p  pWhy does the Toast have to be strongmadestrong on the main thread instead of just strongshownstrong therep  psup1. Legacy  I dont think displaying error messages in Toasts is great UI, and I dont think services displaying messages to users directly is a good idea, but thats the code I was handed and Id like to make it this little bit better.supp

Loading 100MB binary mat file takes less than 1 second, load same size ASCII text data takes much longer. p  pI dont think save the matlab mat file into ASCII format and load it into armadillo is a good solution. p

Negative 5992 pI would like nginx to serve static assets instead of rails in production.

What I dont understand is how the request is generated.  If I send some dynamic url thing1, then nginx will proxypass this to the rails app which will send back a response.  Now suppose that response needs an image.  Rails wont serve images in productionin my setup, so nginx must serve it.  But how does nginx know to serve it  I know a separate request is generated for that image that will match the image location directive and so avoid the proxypass, but whenwhere is that request generated  Does the initial rails response tell the browser to make an additional request for the image,  or does rails make the request itself directly to nginxp

We can do so by having an integer   counter that keeps track of the number of full buffers. Initially,   counter is set to 0. It is incremented by the producer after it   produces a new buffer and is decremented by the consumer after it   consumes a    buffer.p blockquote  pAnd the algorithms for this problem are as followp  pProducer algorithmp  precodewhile true       produce an item in nextproduced        while counter  BUFFERSIZE        do nothing       buffer[in]  nextproduced      in  in  1  BUFFERSIZE      counter   codepre  pConsumer algorithmp  precodewhile true      while counter  0   do nothing       nextconsumed  buffer[out]      out  out  1  BUFFERSIZE       counter       consume the item in next consumed    codepre  pYou can find these algorithms in the slides of the Process Synchronization chapter a hrefhttpcodex.cs.yale.eduaviosbookOS9slidedirPPTdirch5.ppt relnofollowhttpcodex.cs.yale.eduaviosbookOS9slidedirPPTdirch5.pptap  pI didnt understand how these algorithms are supposed to fill ALL the buffers. As far as I see they fill only one buffer. Am I right or I am missing something These algorithms already mentioned in the book since 2007 at least, so I suppose that there is no error, but I misunderstood themp  pAny explanation is welcome.p

I am not sure what could be improperly configured to cause such an error, so Im not sure where to start.p  pI have not made any changes to the configurations for Zookeeper or Hadoop, so Hadoop is in its basic standalone mode, which I have confirmed to be working via one of their examples.  Zookeeper startsstops properly with zkServer.  So Im guessing the problem is in my Accumulo configuration.  Unfortunately their README is not helpful at all for my situation, and basically just tells me that the Accumulo binaries Ive downloaded should just work out of the box.p  pI have tried running this with the environment variable JAVAHOME both set and unset, and with it explicitly defined in accumuloenv.sh.p  pThank you for anything that can point me in the right direction.

Negative 5992 pI am trying to use the function codeCellsRows.Count, 14.EndxlUp.Rowcode to determine the last row with data. This and similar formulas appear in many spots in my VBA code. My spreadsheet is quite complex and I often need to add columns. So rather than referring to Column 14, Id like to use a value I can easily change in only one place. I am using a named Column of sorts that I only need to update in one place. Items sold appears in column N. I realize that this code is very simple, but I simplified it down for the sake of asking a question. When I try to run the Test sub, I a compile errror ByRef argument type mismatch and the variable ItemSold. The reason I am using a letter is that codeRangecode needs a letter, but codeCells.EndxlUp.Rowcode needs a number.p  pIt works if I move  codeItemsSold  Ncode to the sub from the function, but this means this code would have to go in every sub rather than in just one function.p  pFunctionp  precodeFunction ColNumColumnNumber As String As Integer Dim ItemsSold As String ItemsSold  N ColNum  RangeReplace, , ColumnNumber.Column End Function codepre  pMacrop  precodeSub Test Dim TotalItemsSold As Integer TotalItemsSold  CellsRows.Count, ColNumItemsSold.EndxlUp.Row End Sub codepre

Negative 5992 pI am working on my companies .NET remoting server application to try and make it bind to all available NICs, so that it listens on multiple subnets.p  pThe current way we do it is by telling the server to bind to a specific IP address and that has worked in the past, but when hosted on a server with multiple subnets the clients all need to be on the same subnet or they wont be able to speak to the server.p  pOne solution I tried was to tell the server to bind to the machine name of the server it was running on using the following codep  precode  If there is an IP present in the config to bind to, then bind on that specific IP.  if string.IsNullOrEmptyremotingBindTo        props.AddbindTo, remotingBindTo     Otherwise bind on the machine name, meaning the server should bind on all IP addresses.  else        props.AddmachineName, Environment.MachineName      props.AdduseIpAddress, false      Create a new channel              IChannel channel  new TcpServerChannelprops, null    Register the channel  ChannelServices.RegisterChannelchannel, remotingSecure codepre  pThat basically says if the servers config setting RemotingBindTo is set then we bind to the provided IP address otherwise we bind to the machine name.p  pThe problem with this is if you use a VPN connection to connect a client to the server. When the client is creating a proxy to a server object it is trying to connect via the machine name and the client PC can not resolve that to an IP address. A work around to this was to place the name into the Windows hosts file and tell it to resolve to the VPN IP address, but because the VPN gives a different IP address every time this is not a viable solution.p  pI suppose my question is Is it possible AT ALL to get a .NET remoting server to bind to all available NICsIP addressesp  pHas anyone else experienced anything similarp

You know, the ones that look like thisp  precode voidaddStatesObjectidobject  voidinsertObjectidobject inStatesAtIndexNSUIntegerindex codepre  pNow I have both, and thats cool, but I want my class interface to be nice and clean, so its easier to read and understand. My question is when implementing the a hrefhttpsdeveloper.apple.comlibrarymacdocumentationcocoaconceptualKeyValueCodingArticlesAccessorConventions.htmlapplerefdocuid20002174178660 relnofollow titleKeyValue Coding Accessor MethodsKVC accessor patternsa, do I need to declare those methods or do I get KVCcompliance for free by just implementing the methods Or a better question is do I even need to implement the KVC methods if I make my own customnamed onesp  pHopefully this makes sense, but if not, Ill try to explain it a little better.

Negative 5992 pI am trying to implement security in my Spring web application that only those users who have purchased the application will only use the application  and not the others. Apart from that I also need to make sure that the user will use the web app only between a specific time frame for which he  has paid for.p  pstrongEDIT 1strongp  pAt present I am thinking of servlet filters to use and intercept the requests to access my pages. As each request is intercepted by the container itself I have full control over my resources. I can also make sure that the pages are served during the fixed duration as I have access to codeFilterConfigcode and hence Servlet Context. p  pI also know about AOP method interception. In case of AOP the controller method calls interception is done by spring container but not the application server. Does this have any limitations over using Filters Any ideas or suggestions Or what other standards exist for tasks like thisp

Negative 5992 pI am trying to use a powershell script to get the wordcount from a number of word files and then output that to a csv file.

The problem is that the server is running v4.0.10 and its asking for v4.2.6.

Negative 5992 pUPDATED QUESTION A simple clientside HTTP.get call is not working on the iOS emulator. The same call is fetching data and its displaying perfectly in my templates in the browser localhost3000 Earlier I thought this got to do with local collections, but the problem is actually with the HTTP.get call which is not returning any data within cordova ios emulator or device. p  pPlease note that my entire code is only on the client if Meteor.isClient  and nothing in if Meteor.isCordova .p  pORIGINAL QUESTION Is it possible to define a local collection in Cordova Meteor 0.9.3 I have a localclientonly collection in my app as shown  Items  new Meteor.Collectionnullp  pThis local collection temporarily gets data from an external API  by adding meteor add http and using HTTP.get  and this content is pushed to the templates. This is appearing perfectly in the browser templates on localhost3000 through the helpers  return Items.find , but when I run meteor run ios, the data is not loading up in the iOS simulator.p  pFirst of all, is it even possible to expect a local collection to work within Cordova Should this be defined inside Meteor.isCordova  Does it require a cordovaspecific package to be added I believe a local collection is necessary in this case because the data is retrieved based on the users device location and its relevant only for the current session.p  pAny thoughts would be appreciated.p  pmeteor noob here, sorry if this sounds stupidp  pEDIT Collections defined both on the server and client are working in the browser as well as on iOS emulator. So the problem is only with local collections.p

Negative 5992 pI have a fairly big file that I matcedh with another file before uploading it to my database using MySQL. The original file was 211k codet1code and the returning match after matching it with the existing database codet2code is around 300k  which means I have to do almost 90k work of recordremoval before I can upload.p  pSince the first query where I used a codeLEFT JOINcode to match them on name took so long, I saved the results as a new table called codematchnewcode the 300k records, seemingly with 90k of duplicates or bad matches. Heres a sample of the codematchnewcode schema after I joined codet1code and codet2codep  precodeCREATE TABLE rnmatchnew    id1 varchar255 DEFAULT NULL,   first1 varchar255 DEFAULT NULL,   last1 varchar255 DEFAULT NULL,   phone1 varchar255 DEFAULT NULL,   zip1 varchar255 DEFAULT NULL   id2 varchar255 DEFAULT NULL,   first2 varchar255 DEFAULT NULL,   last2 varchar255 DEFAULT NULL,   phone2 varchar255 DEFAULT NULL,   zip2 varchar255 DEFAULT NULL codepre  pAnd the two IDs [codeid1code and codeid2code] do not match  theyre two unique identifiers from two different databases.p  pRight now Im looking at most of those duplicates or bad matches by using this simple queryp  precodeSELECT , COUNTid1 FROM matchnew GROUP BY id1 HAVING COUNTid1 gt 1 codepre  pThe good thing about each table that I matched had different unique identifiers attached to them codeid1code from the first table and codeid2code from the second table, which now both exist in codematchnewcode  so it should be fairly easy to see when records are appearing multiple times. Also I because I left joined two existing tables together to get codematchnewcode, that means that I have two sets of data for each person from each table  so two names, two phone numbers, two addresses, etc. But I only did the codeLEFT JOINcode on first and last name to ensure Id get the biggest possible return to make sure I didnt miss anybody in case they moved or we have different phone numbers for them, etc.p  pMy question is Is there code I can write or add to the above query which will remove rows if they fit a certain criteria emonly ifem there is more than one unique ID in the table So for example, if my codeid1code was 1234567 and my query above showed that there were now three of me in the final column, is there additional code I can write to remove one or two but not all three of the duplicates or bad matches if my data doesnt match up with other qualifiers e.g. phone number or zip codep  pTo further clarify, if my record with codeid1code 1234567 from the initial codet1code matched with three people with my name from codet2code  is there a way to remove up to two of the rows if, for example, the record from codet1code matched the same phone number as one of the three records with the same name from codet2code The only reason why I specify up to two is because this example has three duplicates  and if none of them match the phone number, I dont want to lose them all entirely in case thats a decision I can make manually.p  pThat was way more complicated to describe than I expected  so please just let me know if I can provide any further clarification Thanks so much for the help.p

Negative 5992 pI got this error when i try to redirect the user into the requested path after he logs in.p  pLets say when he clicks on a link of My accounts settings which is secured, he is redirected to the login page to authenticate, then back to the My account settings page if the authentication is a success.p  pBy it creates a loop error, which is due to my understanding to the fact that he is being redirected form login to the page which needs login than again the page because he is already athenticated...p  pNow i tried to solve this problem by doing the followingp  pIn codeApplicationControllercodep  precodebeforeaction storelocation  def storelocation    store last url  this is needed for postlogin redirect to whatever the user last visited.   return unless request.get    if request.path  userssignin ampamp       request.path  userssignup ampamp       request.path  userspasswordnew ampamp       request.path  userspasswordedit ampamp       request.path  usersconfirmation ampamp       request.path  userssignout ampamp       request.xhr  dont store ajax calls     session[previousurl]  request.fullpath    end end   def aftersigninpathforresource   session.deletepreviousurl   rootpath end  def loggedin   currentuser  true  false end codepre  pIn codePagesControllercodep  precodebeforeaction authenticateuser, only [show], unless gt loggedin codepre  pSo that, after the succesful authentication, we skip the authenticateuser to go directly to render the show view instead of going into the loginredirect logic...p  pUnfortunetly, it didnt fix the problem...p  pDo you see something that i am missing here p  pThanksp

Negative 5992 pNaturally, in order for a typical modern processor architecture like x8664 to perform an atomic load or store, the data to be readwritten needs to be aligned.p  pBut how is this requirement actually realizedenforced via C11 codeltatomicgtcode variablesp  pSuppose I have an architecture that supports 16byte compare and swap doubleword CAS, so it can atomically readwrite 16byte values, and I define a 16byte typep  precodestruct doubleword      stduint64t x     stduint64t y  codepre  pNow, suppose I include an codestdatomicltdoublewordgtcode as a member field of a classp  precodeclass foo      public      stdatomicltdoublewordgt dword  codepre  pHow do I know codefoodwordcode is actually aligned on a 16byte boundary  How do I know a call to codedword.loadcode would actually embeem atomicp  pActually, I originally starting asking this question because of an odd thing that happened when I added another data member before codefoodwordcode.  I defined codefoocode asp  precodeclass foo      public      stduint64t x     stdatomicltdoublewordgt dword   codepre  pWhen I actually perform an atomic load on codefoodwordcode, and compile and run using GCC 4.7.2 on an x8664 machine running Debian Linux, it actually gives me a Segmentation Faultp  pFull programp  precodeinclude ltatomicgt include ltcstdintgt      struct doubleword              stduint64t x         stduint64t y           class foo              public          stduint64t x         stdatomicltdoublewordgt dword  lt not aligned on 16byte boundary           int main              foo f         doubleword d  f.dword.load  lt segfaults with GCC 4.7.2       codepre  pThis actually segfaults on codef.dword.loadcode.  At first I didnt understand why, but then I realized that codedwordcode is strongemnotemstrong aligned on a 16byte boundary.  So, this leads to a lot of questions like what should the compiler do if an atomic variable is not aligned and we try to atomically load it  Is it undefined behavior  Why did the program simply segfaultp  pSecondly, what does the C11 standard say about this  Should the compiler make sure that codedoublewordcode is automatically aligned on a 16byte boundary  If so, does that mean GCC is simply buggy here  If not  it would seem it is up to the user to ensure alignment, in which case emanyem time we use an codestdatomicltTgtcode larger than one byte, it would seem wed emhaveem to use codestdalignedstoragecode to ensure it is properly aligned, which A seems cumbersome, and B is something Ive never actually seen done in practice or in any examplestutorials.p  pSo, how should a programmer using C11 codeltatomicgtcode handle alignment issues like thisp

Negative 5992 pThis is more of a conceptual question, I do not have a specific problemp  pI am learning python for data analysis, but I ma very familiar with R  one of the great things about R is plyr and of course ggplot2 and even better dplyr.

Negative 5992 pIm in a current situations in which I have a REST endpoint that accepts POST of incoming JSON messages.p  pThe thing is that I dont think I can specify the POJO object so Jackson can marshall the JSON into the POJO object. Reason for this is that I dont have control of what comes to that endpoint, and number of fields and type can change over time, thus, defining a POJO before hand seems not an option.p  pSo I guess the question is....can I simply tell Jackson to dont do any marshalling and give the String of the response I can deal with that later with JSONObjectJSONArray or Gson maybe. Say Id have a method like thisp  precodePOST Pathcallback ProducesMediaType.APPLICATIONJSON ConsumesMediaType.APPLICATIONJSON public Response facebookUpdateString json      Do something with the json response...  codepre  pIf this is not feasible with JerseyJAX...any other alternativesp  pThanks Alejandrop

Negative 5992 pIn a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions26816906inthefluxarchitecturewhoisresponsibleforsendingupdatestotheservera previous questiona I asked who is responsible for sending updates to the server in a Flux app. People told me that Actions should do this.  So Im assuming that the same goes for fetching data from the server you have a FetchData action, which fetches the data and dispatches the data for the store to hold onto. But in such a case, how would the caching logic workp  pI think I would have to store the last time the list was requested, and the lists TTL within the StreamsStore and the fetchStreams action would retrieve the TTL and last fetch time to determine whether the server needs to be consulted.p  pIs this the correct way to go It seems strange to me to spread the caching logic between the store and the action, but I cant think of a better way to do it.p

Negative 5992 pI have a simple little Applescript that I wrote a few months back which Ive named MiniVolume and given a dock icon for easy access. It works like so the user opens the application, and it asks what they would like to change the output volume to.

Doing so would be invaluable to me, as it would help me gauge just how much I need to change the number when setting my volume to fractions of a notch.p  pHeres the AppleScript short enough to go here in one piece, I suppose.

Negative 5992 pI want to implement a C program in Linux Ubuntu distro that mimics codetail fcode. Note that I do not want to actually call codetail fcode from my C code, rather implement its behaviour. At the moment I can think of two ways to implement it.p  ol liWhen the program is called, I seek to the end of file. Afterwards, I would read to the end of file periodically and print whatever I read if it is not empty.li liThe second method which can potentially be more efficient is to again, seek to the end of file. But, this time I somehow listen for changes to that file and read to the end of file, only if I it is changed.li ol  pWith that being said, my question is how to implement the second approach and if someone can share if it is worth the effort. Also, are these the only two optionsp  pNOTE Thanks for the comments, the question is changed based on them.p

If so does anybody know how to close them See belowp  precode[34mSupported Server Ciphers[0m Failed    SSLv3  256 bits  ECDHERSAAES256GCMSHA384 Failed    SSLv3  256 bits  ECDHEECDSAAES256GCMSHA384 Failed    SSLv3  256 bits  ECDHERSAAES256SHA384 Failed    SSLv3  256 bits  ECDHEECDSAAES256SHA384 Accepted  SSLv3  256 bits  ECDHERSAAES256SHA Rejected  SSLv3  256 bits  ECDHEECDSAAES256SHA Failed    SSLv3  256 bits  SRPDSSAES256CBCSHA Failed    SSLv3  256 bits  SRPRSAAES256CBCSHA Failed    SSLv3  256 bits  SRPAES256CBCSHA Failed    SSLv3  256 bits  DHEDSSAES256GCMSHA384 Failed    SSLv3  256 bits  DHERSAAES256GCMSHA384 Failed    SSLv3  256 bits  DHERSAAES256SHA256 Failed    SSLv3  256 bits  DHEDSSAES256SHA256 Accepted  SSLv3  256 bits  DHERSAAES256SHA Rejected  SSLv3  256 bits  DHEDSSAES256SHA Accepted  SSLv3  256 bits  DHERSACAMELLIA256SHA Rejected  SSLv3  256 bits  DHEDSSCAMELLIA256SHA Rejected  SSLv3  256 bits  AECDHAES256SHA Failed    SSLv3  256 bits  ADHAES256GCMSHA384 Failed    SSLv3  256 bits  ADHAES256SHA256 Rejected  SSLv3  256 bits  ADHAES256SHA Rejected  SSLv3  256 bits  ADHCAMELLIA256SHA Failed    SSLv3  256 bits  ECDHRSAAES256GCMSHA384 Failed    SSLv3  256 bits  ECDHECDSAAES256GCMSHA384 Failed    SSLv3  256 bits  ECDHRSAAES256SHA384 Failed    SSLv3  256 bits  ECDHECDSAAES256SHA384 Rejected  SSLv3  256 bits  ECDHRSAAES256SHA Rejected  SSLv3  256 bits  ECDHECDSAAES256SHA Failed    SSLv3  256 bits  AES256GCMSHA384 Failed    SSLv3  256 bits  AES256SHA256 Accepted  SSLv3  256 bits  AES256SHA Accepted  SSLv3  256 bits  CAMELLIA256SHA Failed    SSLv3  256 bits  PSKAES256CBCSHA Accepted  SSLv3  168 bits  ECDHERSADESCBC3SHA Rejected  SSLv3  168 bits  ECDHEECDSADESCBC3SHA Failed    SSLv3  168 bits  SRPDSS3DESEDECBCSHA Failed    SSLv3  168 bits  SRPRSA3DESEDECBCSHA Failed    SSLv3  168 bits  SRP3DESEDECBCSHA Accepted  SSLv3  168 bits  EDHRSADESCBC3SHA Rejected  SSLv3  168 bits  EDHDSSDESCBC3SHA Rejected  SSLv3  168 bits  AECDHDESCBC3SHA Rejected  SSLv3  168 bits  ADHDESCBC3SHA Rejected  SSLv3  168 bits  ECDHRSADESCBC3SHA Rejected  SSLv3  168 bits  ECDHECDSADESCBC3SHA Accepted  SSLv3  168 bits  DESCBC3SHA Failed    SSLv3  168 bits  PSK3DESEDECBCSHA Failed    SSLv3  128 bits  ECDHERSAAES128GCMSHA256 Failed    SSLv3  128 bits  ECDHEECDSAAES128GCMSHA256 Failed    SSLv3  128 bits  ECDHERSAAES128SHA256 Failed    SSLv3  128 bits  ECDHEECDSAAES128SHA256 Accepted  SSLv3  128 bits  ECDHERSAAES128SHA Rejected  SSLv3  128 bits  ECDHEECDSAAES128SHA Failed    SSLv3  128 bits  SRPDSSAES128CBCSHA Failed    SSLv3  128 bits  SRPRSAAES128CBCSHA Failed    SSLv3  128 bits  SRPAES128CBCSHA Failed    SSLv3  128 bits  DHEDSSAES128GCMSHA256 Failed    SSLv3  128 bits  DHERSAAES128GCMSHA256 Failed    SSLv3  128 bits  DHERSAAES128SHA256 Failed    SSLv3  128 bits  DHEDSSAES128SHA256 Accepted  SSLv3  128 bits  DHERSAAES128SHA Rejected  SSLv3  128 bits  DHEDSSAES128SHA Rejected  SSLv3  128 bits  DHERSASEEDSHA Rejected  SSLv3  128 bits  DHEDSSSEEDSHA Accepted  SSLv3  128 bits  DHERSACAMELLIA128SHA Rejected  SSLv3  128 bits  DHEDSSCAMELLIA128SHA Rejected  SSLv3  128 bits  AECDHAES128SHA Failed    SSLv3  128 bits  ADHAES128GCMSHA256 Failed    SSLv3  128 bits  ADHAES128SHA256 Rejected  SSLv3  128 bits  ADHAES128SHA Rejected  SSLv3  128 bits  ADHSEEDSHA Rejected  SSLv3  128 bits  ADHCAMELLIA128SHA Failed    SSLv3  128 bits  ECDHRSAAES128GCMSHA256 Failed    SSLv3  128 bits  ECDHECDSAAES128GCMSHA256 Failed    SSLv3  128 bits  ECDHRSAAES128SHA256 Failed    SSLv3  128 bits  ECDHECDSAAES128SHA256 Rejected  SSLv3  128 bits  ECDHRSAAES128SHA Rejected  SSLv3  128 bits  ECDHECDSAAES128SHA Failed    SSLv3  128 bits  AES128GCMSHA256 Failed    SSLv3  128 bits  AES128SHA256 Accepted  SSLv3  128 bits  AES128SHA Rejected  SSLv3  128 bits  SEEDSHA Accepted  SSLv3  128 bits  CAMELLIA128SHA Failed    SSLv3  128 bits  PSKAES128CBCSHA Rejected  SSLv3  128 bits  ECDHERSARC4SHA Rejected  SSLv3  128 bits  ECDHEECDSARC4SHA Rejected  SSLv3  128 bits  AECDHRC4SHA Rejected  SSLv3  128 bits  ADHRC4MD5 Rejected  SSLv3  128 bits  ECDHRSARC4SHA Rejected  SSLv3  128 bits  ECDHECDSARC4SHA Rejected  SSLv3  128 bits  RC4SHA Rejected  SSLv3  128 bits  RC4MD5 Failed    SSLv3  128 bits  PSKRC4SHA Rejected  SSLv3  56 bits   EDHRSADESCBCSHA Rejected  SSLv3  56 bits   EDHDSSDESCBCSHA Rejected  SSLv3  56 bits   ADHDESCBCSHA Rejected  SSLv3  56 bits   DESCBCSHA Rejected  SSLv3  40 bits   EXPEDHRSADESCBCSHA Rejected  SSLv3  40 bits   EXPEDHDSSDESCBCSHA Rejected  SSLv3  40 bits   EXPADHDESCBCSHA Rejected  SSLv3  40 bits   EXPDESCBCSHA Rejected  SSLv3  40 bits   EXPRC2CBCMD5 Rejected  SSLv3  40 bits   EXPADHRC4MD5 Rejected  SSLv3  40 bits   EXPRC4MD5 Rejected  SSLv3  0 bits    ECDHERSANULLSHA Rejected  SSLv3  0 bits    ECDHEECDSANULLSHA Rejected  SSLv3  0 bits    AECDHNULLSHA Rejected  SSLv3  0 bits    ECDHRSANULLSHA Rejected  SSLv3  0 bits    ECDHECDSANULLSHA Failed    SSLv3  0 bits    NULLSHA256 Rejected  SSLv3  0 bits    NULLSHA Rejected  SSLv3  0 bits    NULLMD5 codepre  pThanks a lotp

Negative 5992 pI have a page that has a form above the fold. When the user scrolls down on the page and the form is no longer visible a fixed banner appears at the top of the page and contains the same form. When the user scrolls back up and can view the original form again, the banner disappears. Due to constraints of the site that I am working on the two forms need to have identical ids and input ids. However, submitting the forms now creates an issue since both have the same ids. I would want to use jquery or javascript to alter the forms and its inputs ids when scrolling. Lets assume the form is as followsp  precodeltform idformidgt     ltinput typetext nameinput1 idinput1 valuename placeholdernamegt     ltinput typetext nameinput2 idinput2 valuename placeholdernamegt ltformgt codepre  pThis form appears in the main div in the formp  precodeltdiv idmaingt     ltform idformidgt         ltinput typetext nameinput1 idinput1 valuename placeholdernamegt         ltinput typetext nameinput2 idinput2 valuename placeholdernamegt     ltformgt ltdivgt codepre  pThe banner form which is hidden by default until the user scrolls is as followsp  precodeltdiv idbannergt     ltform idformidgt         ltinput typetext nameinput1 idinput1 valuename placeholdernamegt         ltinput typetext nameinput2 idinput2 valuename placeholdernamegt     ltformgt ltdivgt codepre  pHow can I toggle the ids in these two forms so that when the banner is hidden would have different ids than the form in the main div.

I assumed the last part of the string was just the line number so I kept incrementing it. p  pAnother question I have is, should I go ahead and define all the records as variables and do the coderegexpsubstrcode individually on all the fields that are part of the importp

Negative 5992 pWe have certain sets of clusters URL and sometimes they go to hung state. URL will open but wont allow you to login. Only way to make sure that its in hung state is by manually logging into each URL and see which one is throwing invalid password message. So instead of doing it manually I wanted to write a shell script for checking it and sending out the mail if its hung. We already have a script that checks if the URL is up. It just checks the http mesaage. But i want something which can pass the login credentials and let us know if its throwing invalid username password message. Thanks a lot for your help.p

Negative 5992 pIm working on a large typescript project.  I prefer to create many small classes and put each in a separate file, and use deeply nested namespaces internal modules in typescript.  I consider this to be good practice as it encourages encapsulation, testability, reusability etc.  I have more than a hundred small typescript files with deep namespaces.  p  pThe compiled .js output for each typescript file contains 3 lines of autogenerated boilerplate for each file, for each level of namespace 2 at the top, one at the bottom.

However, Python 3 seems to give different numbers than Python 2 when using coderandom.choice[D, C]codep  pFollowing snippetp  precodeimport random random.seed1  for i in range10     printrandom.choice[C, D], end,  codepre  pgives different result for Python 2 and 3p  precode python2 test.py                                                                                                                                                      C, D, D, C, C, C, D, D, C, C   python3 test.py C, C, D, C, D, D, D, D, C, C codepre  pHowever, coderandom.randomcode method works the same on 2.x and 3.xp  precodeimport random random.seed1  for i in range10     printrandom.random   python3 test.py 0.13436424411240122 0.8474337369372327 0.763774618976614 0.2550690257394217 0.49543508709194095 0.4494910647887381 0.651592972722763 0.7887233511355132 0.0938595867742349 0.02834747652200631   python2 test.py 0.134364244112 0.847433736937 0.763774618977 0.255069025739 0.495435087092 0.449491064789 0.651592972723 0.788723351136 0.0938595867742 0.028347476522 codepre  h1Workaroundh1  pI can codemockcode the output of coderandom.choicecode, which works well for simple test cases. However, for fairly complicated test cases, Im not able to mock output, because I simply dont know how it should look like.p  h1The questionh1  pHave I done something wrong when calling coderandom.choicecode methodp
Negative 5992 pWhen you call codeUIApplication.sharedApplication.setStatusBarHiddentrue, withAnimation .Slidecode at any time inside a controller that is embedded in a codeUINavigationControllercode in a project with view controller based status bar appearance set to codeNOcode, the status bar will slide away, and the height of the navigation bar will decrease as well. That doesnt work well in my case. p  pI dont want the navigation bar height to be modified. I want the status bar text to slide away but thats it. I just discovered the Slack app does this exactly when you slide out the left sidebar. The status bar slides up and when you close the sidebar it animates back down without affecting the navigation bar height. How can I obtain that same behaviorp  pNote that in landscape I do want the default navbar appearance  decreased height and no status bar visible.p

Negative 5992 pI have a page with an iframe that displays an image and comments. I dont want anyone to be required to click in the iframe and scroll to see all the content.

Negative 5992 pIm new to using macros on Excel, and Ive been having some trouble. I have a sheet called Rating Plate Template which has been sized and formatted to a 11 scale with a physical rating plate we then print these rating plates directly from the Excel file through a CNCLaser Cutting machine. p  pThe template is populated from another sheet called Data, and Ive written a macro already that will automatically remove unused rows from the template if theyre empty in the Data sheet. The Data sheet works as follows A1 through A36 are titles. Right now, B1 through B36 relate to these titles on the template and populate them that way.p  pWhat I would like to do is write a macro that will do the following p  pWhenever information is added to a new column in the Data sheet after B, I want it to create a new sheet called Rating Plate Template 1,2,3... which has the empty template from the original Rating Plate Template sheet, and is then populated accordingly with the information from that column of the Data sheet. Its safe to assume that any titles rows from column A that were empty in the previous column will also be empty in the following column, so my previous macro should handle those. p  p[Data Sheet][1]p  p[Rating Plate Template Sheet][2]p  pMy current macro p  precodeSub sbFixSizingforTemplate    Dim lRow As Long  Dim i As Long  Dim lCol As Long  Dim j As Long   lRow  20  lCol  7   For i  lRow To 8 Step 1      For j  lCol To 3 Step 1          If Cellsi, j  0 Then              Cellsi, j.Delete ShiftxlUp          End If      Next  Next   End Sub  codepre  pP.S. On a different note my macro will shift columns up, but I cant figure out how to make it maintain the bottom three rows I always want them to be together.

Negative 5992 pive recently created a GPS Location Service which uses FusedLocationProviderAPI from GooglePlayServiceAPI. Everything is working fine except receiving coordinates without an enabled internet connection. p  pIve did a lot of research why this isnt working without an internet connection and i still dont know why.

When i start the location updates while i am connected to the internet and disable my internet connection the location update is still working. Somehow, it changes then from the internet provider to GPS provider. p  pAm I doing anything wrong or is it a bug that i am not able to get coordinates without an internet connection.p

Negative 5992 pIm trying to implement a simple Markov Chain Monte Carlo in Python 2.7, using numpy. The goal is to find the solution to the Knapsack Problem, where given a set of m objects of value vi and weight wi, and a bag with holding capacity b, you find the greatest value of objects that can be fit into your bag, and what those objects are. I started coding in the Summer, and my knowledge is extremely lopsided, so I apologize if Im missing something obvious, Im selftaught and have been jumping all over the place.p  pThe code for the system is as follows I split it into parts in an attempt to figure out whats going wrong.p  precodeimport numpy as np import random   def flipzsackcontents      This picks a random object, and changes whether its been selected or not.     pickrandom.randint0,lensackcontents1     clonezsackcontents     np.putclonez,pick,1clonez[pick]     return clonez  def checkcompliancecheckedz,checkedweights,checkedsack     This checks to see whether a given configuration is overweight     weightVectornp.dotcheckedz,checkedweights     weightSumnp.sumweightVector     if weightSum gt checkedsack         return False     else         return True  def getrandomzlength     I use this to get a random starting configuration.

It should discard the options with too much weight, while keeping track of the ones with the highest value and acceptable weight. The correct answer would be to see 1,0,1 as the configuration, with 9 as the maximized value. I get nine for value every time when I use even moderately high amounts of iterations, but the configurations seem completely random, and somehow break the weight rule. Ive doublechecked my checkcompliance function with a lot of test arrays, and it seems to work. How are these faulty, overweight configurations getting past my if statements and into my zrecord p
Negative 5992 pIn the app Im writing there is a class cluster that provides rendering means.  It resolves to OpenGLES3 version when the device is capable of that, and falls back to OpenGLES2 version otherwise. It looks roughly like the following code.p  precode Client code   Renderer is the class cluster instantiated like this  self.renderer  [Renderer rendererForAPIself.context.API]      Inside Renderer implementation block   instancetyperendererForAPIuintapiVersion      Renderer renderer     if apiVersion gt 3          renderer  [[RendererForES3 alloc] init]      else          renderer  [[RendererForES2 alloc] init]           return renderer         Both RendererForES3 and RendererForES2 classes   are descendants of Renderer.   One of them imports OpenGLES.ES3,   and the other imports OpenGLES.ES2.   codepre  pI do not want the code to duplicate overly. Some of my drawing methods are very similar in both members of the cluster, and some of the methods are nearly identical. I realise that OpenGL calls, even with exactly the same name, may map to different offsets in different versions of the standard.p  pSo the question is how to keep code duplication at its minimum. There are two obvious solutions that sprung to my head. The first one is to inherit ES3Renderer from ES2 Renderer, overriding necessary methods and keeping the rest. But in that case, ES3Renderer would receive both OpenGL imports at the same time. Im not sure which precautions are to consider in that case, and how well will it work on different hardware.p  pThe second solution is simply to keep the repeating code in a text file that would be included in both implementations via codeincludecode directive. But this seems to encumber maintenance.p  pPerhaps there are some advice on how to reuse code in renderers which rely on different versions of OpenGL standard. Maybe its an architecture issue and my code should have been designed some other way. What decision should I takep
