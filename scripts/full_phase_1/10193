This feature of MSIE allows you to point to a single XML data source of no particular schema, just as long as its in a standard table and the browser renders the data visually and asyncrhonously. p  pThe benefit of this is that the page renders quickly, because the page load does not wait for the entirety of the table to be filled in before showing the user some output. The table rows get filled in progressively.p  pemFalse Startsem The following have already been attempted and rejected by Customer X.p  ul liJQuery works great for loading the data, and cleanmaintainable HTML markup, but large data sources cause latency and memory problems when rendering clientsideli liXSLT this scares Customer X because it involves a lot more than just specifying a datasource attribute on a lttablegt tag, and thus appears to be less maintainable in his opinionli liServerside data pagination this is not an option because Customer X religiously wants to avoid segmenting the XML data or doing any data munging on the server side.li ul

Negative 10193 pI have a iPhone app with a main view that is 480 x 510.  Im a bit confused as to how the coordinate system changes when I go from portrait to landscapeRight. p  pInitially, I had a 480x480 content area, and wanted to add a button on the side to bring up a menu.  However, the only way I could find to have the writing run down the length of the left side of the app was to change the orientation of the whole app to landscape right.p  pNow, with the orientation in Landscape, the scrollview is starting at the top left, when I really want it to start at the original orientation point from when it was in portrait mode, which would be bottom left.  But I cant figure out how to change the original starting point of the scrollview.  I tried contentOffset, but it doesnt seem to be working.  p  pAnother way of going about this that I might end up doing is forget having a title on the button, and just create a graphic for the button that has text vertically oriented.  p  precodeif self  [super initWithCodercoder]   Size of the scrollview self.contentSize  CGSizeMake480, 510 [self setContentOffsetCGPointMake 0, 160] self.showsHorizontalScrollIndicator  YES self.showsVerticalScrollIndicator  YES self.alwaysBounceVertical  NO self.alwaysBounceHorizontal  NO self.bounces  YES self.userInteractionEnabled  YES self.musicGridView  [[[MusicGridView alloc] initWithCodercoder] autorelease]  Rectangle where I put the music grid origin is left aligned, and down 160 pixels to account for landscape view self.musicGridView.frame  CGRectMake0, 160, 480, 480 [self addSubview musicGridView]  self.menuButton  [UIButton buttonWithTypeUIButtonTypeCustom] self.menuButton.frame  CGRectMake0, 480, 480, 32 [menuButton setTitle Tap to get Menu forState UIControlStateNormal] [menuButton setTitleColor[UIColor redColor] forStateUIControlStateNormal] [menuButton addTargetself actionselectorshowMenu forControlEventsUIControlEventTouchUpInside]  [self addSubview menuButton] codepre

Negative 10193 pId like to use gdb or Xcodes debugger to watch every message sent to an object in an ObjectiveC 2.0 program.  I dont care about arguments and such, as I just need to see every message it receives retain, release, autorelease, etc.  I also dont want to profile my entire program.p  pIs there a means, in Xcode, to select an instance possibly by address and say show me every message sent to this object  Since the plumbing is fairly standard, I imagine there would have to be a probe hook or something.  Anyone ever done thisp  piAside from subclassing the object in question, of course looking for a more general solution.ip  pThis is for iPhone development with Xcode 3.2 on Snow Leopard.p

Should I just say if it says the folder name is library.zip, then go one more level down to the dist folderp  pNote that I have pretty nested directory hierarchies... for example, I have a module gui.utils.images, stored in guiutilsimages.py, and it uses its path to access guiimagesok.png, for example. Right now the py2exe version would try to access projdistlibrary.zipguiimagesok.png, or something, which just wont work. p

Negative 10193 phopefully someone here can shed some light on my issue Dp  pIve been creating a Windows XP service in python that is designed to monitorrepair selected WindowsApplicationService settings, atm I have been focusing on default DCOM settings.p  pThe idea is to backup our default configuration within another registry key for reference. Every 30 minutes currently every 30 seconds for testing I would like the service to query the current windows default DCOM settings from the registry and compare the results to the default configuration. If discrepancies are found, the service will replace the current windows settings with the custom configuration settings. p  pI have already createdtested my class to handle the registry checkingrepairing and so far it runs flawlessly.. Until I compile it to an exe and run it as a service.p  pThe service itself starts up just fine and it seems to loop every 30 seconds as defined, but my module to handle the registry checkingrepairing does not seem to get run as specified.p  pI created a log file and was able to obtain the following errorp  pTraceback most recent call lastbr File DCOMMon.pyc, line 52, in RepairDCOMbr File DCOMMon.pyc, line 97, in GetDefaultDCOMbr File pywmi.pyc, line 396, in strongcallstrongbr File pywmi.pyc, line 189, in handlecomerrorbr xwmi 0x7ffdfff7  Exception occurred.br Error in SWbemObjectExbr 0x7ffbfe10    p  pWhen I stop the service and run the exe manually, specifying the debug argument strongDCOMMon.exe debugstrong, the service starts up and runs just fine, performing all tasks as expected. The only differences that I can see is that the service starts the process as the SYSTEM user instead of the logged on user which leads me to believe just guessing here that it might be some sort of missed permissionpolicy for the SYSTEM user I have tested running the service as another user but there was no difference there either. p  pOther thoughts were to add the wmi service to the dependencies of my service but truthfully I have no idea what that would do P This is the first time Ive attempted to create a windows service in python, without using something like srvany.exe. p  pI have spent the better part of last night and today trying to google around and find some information regarding py2exe and wmi compatibility but so far the suggestions I have found have not helped solve the above issue.p  pAny suggestions would be appreciated.p  pPS Dont hate me for the poor logging, I cutpasted my logger from a different scripts and I have not made the appropriate changes, it might double up each line P.

Negative 10193 pI was wondering if somebody has some insight on this issue.p  pstrongA little backgroundstrongp  pWeve been using Rails to migrate from an old dBase and Visual Basic based system to build internal company IntrAnet that does things like label printing, invetory control, shipping, etc  basically an ERPp  pstrongThe Dilemmastrongp  pRight now we need to replace an old customerfacing website  that was done in Java, that would connect to our internal system for our clients to use. We want to be able to pull information like inventory, order placement, account statements from our internal system and expose it to site live. The reason is that we take orders on the website, through fax amp phone and sometimes we have walkins. So sometimes very rarely thou even a short delay in inventory update on our old Java site causes us to put an order on backorder, because we sell the same item to 2 customers within half an hour. Its usually fixed within one day but we want to avoid this in the future.p  pstrongActual Questionstrongp  pDoes anyone have any suggestion on how to accomplish this in a better wayp  pstrongHere are three options that I seestrongp  pa Build a separate Rails app on a web server, that will connect to the strongsamestrong DB that our internal app connects to.p  ul lip PlusesLive data  same thing that our internal apps see, i.e. orders are created in real time, inventory is depleted right awaypli lip Minuses Potential security    risk, duplication of code  i.e. I need to duplicate all the controllers, models, views, etc. that  deal with orders.pli ul  pb Build a separate Rails app on a web server, that will connect to stronga differentstrong DB from our internal app.p  ul li Pluses Less security exposure.li li MinusesExtra effort to sync web DB and internal DB or using a web service like RESTAPI, extra code to handle inventory depletion and order  creation, duplication of code  i.e. I need to duplicate all the controllers, models, views, etc. that deal with orders.li ul  pc Expose internal app to the webp  ul li Pluses all the problems from above eliminated. This is much DRYer method.li li Minuses A lot more security headaches.

Negative 10193 pThe question is likely confusing and I apologize.  I wasnt sure how best to word it.p  pI am using jqGrid in a jQueryUI dialog which is inside a form.  The user will use this form to create and edit Events.p  pUpon editing, the user can click a button to open a dialog showing a grid of saved locations for the event.  I want to give them the ability to remove saved locations, but I dont want to delete them right away on the server because they may decide to not save the changes on the main form.  p  pWhat Id like to do is build an array containing the IDs of what locations they delete with the default delete navigator delete button.  When I confirm deletion of rows, it wants an codeediturlcode, but I dont want to delete them right now.p  pIs there a good way to track their deleted records and then delete them once they save the event  I am wondering if I should create a serverside collectionfile and read it once the Event itself is saved I have no idea what the best approach is for this.p  pThank you in advance p

Negative 10193 pIm looking at using Subversion for managing WSDL and XSD artefacts, where I have a service catalogue of around 60 services.  Does anyone know of any articles recommending best practice around this with regards to the granularity between tagging and versions of services.p  pWith SVN, it appears that you can only tag from the trunk.  If our trunk contains all our WSDLs then we would have to tag in a specific way in order to version each service.  For example, if we had a service called AddressManager which was contained in the same trunk as CustomerManager, then in order to tag the trunk to represent a change on the AddressManager service, then the tag would have to be AddressManagerv1.0.0.  Which seems a little unwieldy.p  pIdeal what Id like to get to is to be able to manage my service contracts using SVN and my tags to simply refer to the version number of the service i.e. v1.0.0.  But would this mean a trunk per service  Again, seems like a bit of an overhead.p  pThis has to be a common issue for service contract WSDL amp XSD management  can anyone share any anecdotes or advice on thisp  pThanks,p  pStuartp

Negative 10193 pIn the process of implementing traditional and simplified chinese support in my Android application and I confused on how this is supposed to work.p  pSo from reading the a hrefhttpdeveloper.android.comresourcestutorialslocalizationindex.htmldocumentationa as well as some discussions like a hrefhttpsgroups.google.comgroupandroiddevelopersbrowsethreadthread9d7a3ee32af73fec433ecaba101b2a03thisa and a hrefhttpsgroups.google.comgroupandroiddevelopersbrowsethreadthreadbcbd760d8651ae65ff9b0007050e2123thisa I have put simplified chinese into p  ul livalueszhli livalueszhrCNli livalueszhrSGli ul  pand traditional chinese into p  ul livalueszhrTWli livalueszhrHKli ul  pThat all works fine but somehow does not make sense to me sorry if I dont understand enough about chinese simplified vs traditional usage. p  pFrom what I understand from checking the locale setting dialog in the emulator as well as on a rooted phone a user can change the locale to Simplified Chinese or Traditional Chinese. p  pNow here is the question. How does the system know where to get the simplified or traditional chinese strings.xml. Is there some sort of assumption baked in that says if I am supposed to display simplified chinese get it from valueszh and get traditional from valueszhrTWp  pBut what if a user is located in HK and set his device up to display simplified chinese Or what if an emigrant somewhere else in the world sets his device to traditional chinese but his region is e.g. US or CAp  pWhat do I have to do to allow my users to set their locale and have my app appear with the right locale p  pstrongUpdatestrong p  pFrom further investigation I believe that a Android phone user can not set the country separately from the language. They can only set what is called the locale in the UI. It consists of language and country, but the list is limited so many combinations are not possible.p  pE.g. a Chinese person living in the US that wants to use Traditional Chinese could set the language to traditional chinese at least on a rooted phone and would then have a locale of zhrTW. He could in no way set his country separately to be US. In a similar manner any sort of emigrant can not set their native language with the country they currently live in.. p  pBasically that means that only a bunch of combinations of language and country are supported. Now the questions is how to find out which ones they arep

Negative 10193 pCan anyone explain to me one or more efficient, reliable methods for opening a popup browser window that will contain an ongoing list of updates from the main browser windowp  pImagine that I simply want to display in the popup window one line of text for each mouse click event that happens in the main window.  I know how to bind the event handlers, but I dont know how to open an empty popup window, seed it with some content from the main page e.g. a heading for the window that says, Events Shown Here, and then append HTML content to that window from the main one.p  pThere must be ways of doing this, and Im sure I could figure it out on my own eventually, but perhaps some smarties from SO can help me more quickly.  Google searches on this topic seem to produce an endless list of tutorials and examples on how to open a popup that will contain content from a specified URL, not content provided programmatically from the main page.p  pThere also seems to be a high risk of having the browser block the popup, so any commentary on avoiding that will be appreciated.p  pIf anyone would like to offer comments like Never use popups  They always suck no matter what,  feel free so long as they are not just a flame, because there are obviously certain use cases for which a second window is an appropriate device.p  pThanks to everyone in advance, Brianp

Negative 10193 pMy project has a requirement to gather data from a number of sources, then do things in response to the completion of the gathering of that data. Some of the gathering tasks have dependencies on prior gathering tasks. TPL has been a good fit because it naturally continues with tasks from their antecedents, and the final tasks that use the results are again dependents. Great.  However, we would like to have a sleep and regather task that starts upon completion of the final tasks this tasks job is logically to be the antecedent of the final tasks and kick off the next cycle. In effect, the TPLs DAG becomes cyclic, or, if thought of sequentially, a loop.p  pIs it possible to express this cyclic requirement completely within the TPL API If so, how  Our current implementation instead does a strongWaitAllstrong on the antecedents, and then a strongTask.StartNewstrong given a delegate that does a sleep followed by rebuilding a task graph with the strongWaitAllstrong. This works, but seems a bit artificial.p

Negative 10193 pHey Guys I am building a Java XML validator without using the XML Schema which I notice is what people do. Dont ask why I am not using it.p  pI have my text area, I run the validator class to look through the text and find each XML tag like codeltsomethinggtcode or codeltsomething elsetestgtcode add it to a Stack then if it finds a matching end tag like codeltsomethinggtcode it needs to pop it off the stack until it finds a mismatch error, in which case my validator class will return Invalid at Line X, Char X.p  pWhat I cant really find anywhere is a good regex that will handle both of the scenarios I listed above. So that I can run my splitregexcode and get a list of each of my html tags and see if they are all properly nested.p  pAny help is highly appreciated p  p EDITp  phere is what I was looking for, my brother wrote it a while agop  precodeString expr  ltw.[]gt String expr1  ltw.gt String expr2  ltw.gt Pattern p  Pattern.compileexpr Pattern p1  Pattern.compileexpr1 Pattern p2  Pattern.compileexpr2 codepre  pthanks for nothing the guys who told me not to use regex p

Negative 10193 pWe are using MVC3 with emunobstructuveem validation, all is fine we got our custom validations working on the server as well as on the client.p  pWe are also using the buildin asp.net strongRole providerstrong. We have particular Views that we use for different Roles. Some of the fields properties of the ViewModel are Required based on the Role of the loggedin user.p  pMy question is How do we make a strongValidationAttributestrong based on a Role We want to make a property Required when the user is Normal User but we dont want to make that field required when the user is an Administrator. But we do want to use the same view.p  pI know we can create a custom strongValidationAttributestrong creating a class that derives from strongValidationAttributestrong I suppose that will work fine for ServerSide validation. But we really want to validate this ClientSide. p  pI reckon we implement the strongIClientValidatablestrong in our above strongValidationAttributestrong and write some jQuery to make an Ajax call back to the server to check the current logged in user and its roles. But this will make us do an Ajax call every time the specific property changes, and the loggedin user will not change.p  pWhat is the right way to do this Or should we create different strongViewModelsstrong for different logged in userp  pPlease let me know when my above explanation doesnt make sense, I can add some example code when needed.p  pAny help is appreciated.p  pThanks,p  pPimp

Negative 10193 pWhat is the most efficient way to convert ArrayLists with EO Entity Object into ArrayLists of DTO objects or ArrayLists of Ids. Please, keep in mind that every EO may consist of properties which are also EOs, or collections of EOs, which should internally be converted to DTOs, or omitted depending on the conversion strategy. In general, a lot of boilerplate code. p  pwish it were as simple asp  precodecollectionOfUsers.toArrayListltUserDTOgt  codepre  por..p  precodecollectionOfUsers.toArrayListltIEntitygt  has only an id, therefore it will be converted  into a collection of objects, having only an id. codepre  pof course, this could be nice as wellp  precodecollectionOfUsers.toArrayListltLonggt  does the same thing, returns only a bunch of ids codepre  pOf course, someone should hold the mapping strategies as well, for instance a Factory or sth.p  pany suggestions p

Negative 10193 pstrongQuestions in a nutshellstrongp  ol liIs it possible to force wkhtmltopdf to use Type1 fonts PDF core fonts when generating the pdfli lior Is it possible to force the Qt QPdfEngine to use Type1 fonts PDF core fonts when generating the pdfli ol  pstrongDetailed description of the problem.strongp  pI have developed a webapp to do a pdfexport of a very large database using wkhtmltopdf amp tcpdf. The 900 pages are printed using wkhtmltopdf and then glued together using tcpdf amp fpdi.p  pUnfortunately wkhtmltopdf seems to always embed the fonts it uses to render the pdf. This is very unwanted behavior as this is redundant and bloats the document. Additionally the document needs to be editable in Acrobat Pro. Apparently Acrobat Pro seems to be overwhelmed by embedded fonts. It tries to replace them upon saving the document, and hangs itself after 45 minutes on windows machines on Mac machines it just takes incredibly long to save the document.p  pSo is there a possibility to tell wkhtmltopdf not to embed fonts and use Type1 Fonts Helvetica insteadp  pI couldnt find any switch to do this so i assumed patching wkhtmltopdf would do the trick by using printersetUseEmbeddedFontsfalsep  pUnfortunately this didnt change anything.p  pMy next idea was patching the QtPDFPrinter. Looking into the QPrinterClass and the QPrintEngine I didnt find any place where the pdf engine uses Type1 fonts instead of embedding the TTFFonts or whatever font is used.p  pAny ideas andor pointersp

Negative 10193 pIm porting a game from WP7 XNA to Android everything was working using Canvas but it was too slow so Ive switched to OpenGL ES, following the examples of Replica Island and SpriteMethodTest.p  pMy problem is that my textures arent being coloured or made transparent when I set glColor immediately before drawing the texture  it is completely ignored and the texture is drawn in the state it was loaded.

Negative 10193 pIm creating a game in a hrefhttpen.wikipedia.orgwikiVisualBasic.NET relnofollowVB.NETa using a hrefhttpen.wikipedia.orgwikiOpenGL relnofollowOpenGLa, and I am intending to add a scripting engine in order to allow custom userinterfaces.p  pTo that end I have created a class called window, which contains sub classes, for example, Button.p  pEach sub class naturally represents a control and has relevant events associated with it.p  pFor example, the button control has the event OnClickWindowID, ControlID. Window is usually declared as an array of windows, and each window has its own set of controls window needs to be an array in order for me to emulate general window behavior, such as clicking a window and bringing it to the front using a zOrder which is emulated using a collection.p  pResearch has shown me that you can listen to events in a hrefhttpen.wikipedia.orgwikiIronPython relnofollowIronPythona.p  pFor examplep  precodedef handleargs      print args  from System.IO import  w  FileSystemWatcher w.Path  . w.Changed  handle w.Created  handle w.Deleted  handle codepre  pHowever that doesnt help me hook to events that are firing in the main application which is what I would like to be able to do.p  pI do know I can share objects with IronPython scope.SetVariablex, 100 for example, however passing an object seems to pass the object at the state it was when I passed it creating a new independent object, with the same value like doing thisp  precodeDim a as MyClass Dim b as New MyClass a  b codepre  pThis would be fine for just communicating between the two, but it doesnt let me act on a VB.NET event from within Python, as they are now separate objects.p  pThe idea is that when a button is clicked for example, I should be able to write a Python script to act on that button press, and thus run the form through a set of controls like labels, buttons, textboxes, and allow optional direct access to mouse input for that particular window for custom controls by loading images in an image class.p  pI am able to do all of this already, except handleing a VB.NET event from Python. I was considering cheating by handling all the events myself and setting a set of variables for example, codeScope.SetVariableEvent, ButtonPresscode, but I was wondering if there was a way of doing this properly.p  pThanks.p

Negative 10193 pI have a GridView, with sortable headers. If I click on a header to sort accending or descending on a page other than page 1, it sorts correctly and displays the new sortable results on that page. I want to know if its possible to perform the sort, and then jump back to the first page, maintaining the last sort preference. p  pExamplep  pI have a list of 20 First Names amp Last names. Im currently viewing page 2, records 1120. The list is currently sorted AZ Ascending. When clicking on the the First Name header to sort descending, I want the list to return ZA, but I want the grid to jump back to page 1, displaying ZA.

Negative 10193 pIf I have a class with some readonly properties that are populated by a web service call, what is considered the best way to design thisp  pIs it considered proper for the property getters to make the web service call.  It seems that the downside of this is that the getter is doing more than one thing and obscures the expense of the call.  I realize that any of the property getters only needs to make the web service call once by checking for nulls or flag before making the call.  But that a single property getter could potentially be setting the private fields for other properties seems to smell to me.p  pOn the other hand if I have have a public method ie InitWebServiceVals that calls the web service and updates the private fields I am creating a temporal dependency between the method and the property getters.  So the API obscures the fact that you shouldnt read a property until the InitWebServiceVals is called.  p  pOr is there some other method or pattern that addresses this For example, making the webservice call in the constructor  Or is this generally indicative of a design issuep  pI have run into this issue a number of times and I always ended up preferring the second method to the first.p  pAny thoughtsp  pSethp

Negative 10193 pI have an place where i upload an SVG file using paperclip, and get converted it to PNG with the same dimension.

Negative 10193 pA few days ago I asked a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions9925324aspnetmvcactionresultnotreadingjsondatafromajaxrequestthis questiona about jquery ajax function invoking action in ASP.NET MVC controller. Its now working the way its supposed to but I encountered another problem and Ive been trying to solve it since then.p  pScenario is that the player is creating a new character and is given free points to modify the character stats strenght, agility and intelligence. Im using view model to pass data from controller to view and TempData[model] for passing model between controller actions. Everything looks ok on server side. On click, ajax POST request is sent to server invoking ChangeStat method, character stats are modified in the model. Then I redirect to action which renders the View.p  pMy problem is that the data displayed in the View are still the same i.e. not updated according to modified model. Ive read that its due to MVC validation and so HTML helpers first chceck for old value to display when rendering the same view. I suppose that its quite a common problem but I wasnt able to find a solution. Ive tried using ViewData instead of model, partial view with modelwith ViewData but with no result. Below are code snippets. Hope we can find a solution or maybe my approach is wrong and there is better practice to solve this.p  pController action for changing statsp  precode[HttpPost] public ActionResult ChangeStatLobbyModels.StatChange stat       int changeCoef  0     LobbyModels.CreateCharModel model  LobbyModels.CreateCharModelTempData[model]      if model.CharFreePts  0              return RedirectToActionCreate           switch stat.ActionName               case Inc             changeCoef  1             break         case Dec             changeCoef  1             break           switch stat.StatName               case Str             model.CharStr  model.CharStr  changeCoef             break         case Agi             model.CharAgi  model.CharAgi  changeCoef             break         case Int             model.CharInt  model.CharInt  changeCoef             break           model.CharFreePts  model.CharFreePts  changeCoef  1     TempData[model]  model      return RedirectToActionCreate  codepre  pCreate method which renders the viewp  precodepublic ActionResult Create      LobbyModels.CreateCharModel model  LobbyModels.CreateCharModelTempData[model]     if model  null               null model handling           TempData[model]  model     return Viewmodel  codepre  pand in View I render data from model with html helpersp  precodeltdiv idCharStatsgt     lt Html.TextBoxForm gt m.CharStrgt     ltinput typebutton idStrInc value gt     ltinput typebutton idStrDec value gt     lt Html.TextBoxForm gt m.CharAgigt     ltinput typebutton idAgiInc value gt     ltinput typebutton idAgiDec value gt     lt Html.TextBoxForm gt m.CharIntgt     ltinput typebutton idIntInc value gt     ltinput typebutton idIntDec value gt     ltbr gt     lt Html.TextBoxForm gt m.CharFreePtsgt ltdivgt codepre  pChangeStat function is missing some logic but thats not a problem for now.

Negative 10193 pFor some odd reason, just today our server decided to be very slow during the starting of sessions. For every sessionstart, the server either times out after 30 seconds, or itll take about 20 seconds for it to start the session. This is very weird, seeing as it hasnt done this for a very long time the last time our server did this was about 7 months ago. Ive tried to change the session to run through a database instead, and that works fine, however, as our current website is built, itd take days to go on every page and change the loading of sessions to include a new session handler. Therefore my question remainsp  pWhy is it so slow, and why only sometimesp  pWe run on a dedicated hetzner server with 24GBs of ram, and a CPU fast enough to just run a simple webserver a Xeon, I believe, but Im not sure. We run debian on the server with an apachefastcgiphp5 setup.p  pThe server doesnt report much load, neither through serverstatus as well as the codetopcode command. codeVnstatcode reports no problem whatsoever with our network link again, that wouldnt result in a slow local session handling. codeIOtopcode reports no problem with processes taking over the entire harddrive. Writing to the tmp folder where the session files are located works fast if done through vim.p  pAgain, to make this clear, my main concern here isnt whether or not we should switch to a DB or a memorycached version of the sessions, its simply to ask why this happens, because everything I take a look at seems to be working fine, except for the PHP itself.p  pstrongEDITstrong The maximum file in our PHP tmp directory is 2.9 MB, so nothing that should make an impact, I believe.p  pstrongUPDATEstrong I did never figure out what was wrong andor how to fix it, but the problem disappeared after we switched over to memcacheddb sessions.p
Negative 10193 pI am running 3 instances of a JUCEbased multithreaded OpenGL application on one machine  each of the instances is connected to a separate X display. The main application thread calls codeXInitThreadscode followed by codeXOpenDisplaycode to the appropriate display. A different thread is then used for the main rendering loop. The 3 instances of the application are initialized after each other, so that one is finished with the graphics setup when the next is starting up.p  pIn 80 of the cases everything starts up fine, but sometimes in the second andor third instance of the application the 4th call to codeglXMakeCurrentcode which is also the 1st one made from a different thread than the one on which the connection was initialized never returns. X threads have been initialized, the threads are using locks, and right before the call to codeglXMakeCurrentcode the X Display is locked via codeXLockDisplaycode and unlocked after the call returns.p  pI made sure that each application uses the correct display amp context. If it was purely related to problem of multiple threads accessing the same display connection then it should be equally likely that the first instance encounters this problem  but it never does.p  pAny ideas why codeglXMakeCurrentcode may not return, even though it has exclusive access to its X displayp

I want to scale this video down 3 times, while copying all the other attributes audio codec, subtitles etc.. I use codeffmpeg i ltinputmkvgt vf scaleiw21 acodec copy ltoutputmp4gtcode. Also, VLC detects its resolution as 720x576.p  pThe problem is that after the scaling, the resolution constantly becomes 43 360x288.

When encoding to MPG, it does get copied over and I get an exact copy, with the player switching sizes, but not with MKV.p  pOutput of codeffprobe showstreams filenamecodep  precodeffprobe version 0.10.3 Copyright c 20072012 the FFmpeg developers   built on May  9 2012 175107 with gcc 4.7.0 20120505 prerelease   configuration prefixusr enablelibmp3lame enablelibvorbis enablelibxvid enablelibx264 enablelibvpx enablelibtheora enablelibgsm enablelibspeex enablepostproc enableshared enablex11grab enablelibopencoreamrnb enablelibopencoreamrwb enablelibschroedinger enablelibopenjpeg enablelibrtmp enablelibpulse enablegpl enableversion3 enableruntimecpudetect disabledebug disablestatic   libavutil      51. 35.100  51. 35.100   libavcodec     53. 61.100  53. 61.100   libavformat    53. 32.100  53. 32.100   libavdevice    53.  4.100  53.  4.100   libavfilter     2. 61.100   2. 61.100   libswscale      2.  1.100   2.  1.100   libswresample   0.  6.100   0.  6.100   libpostproc    52.  0.100  52.  0.100 Input 0, matroska,webm, from sample.mkv   Metadata     title            Pan prstenu.

So basically it enlarges image 1 for 5 seconds and than scales it back to normal size after five seconds it moves on to image 2 and enlarges that for 5 seconds as well.

The time intervals are behaving strangely too it runs the codeincreaseimagecode function twice before running codereduceimagecode once this is probably due to my use of the time interval since this is the first time Im utilizing them Ive tried to fix my issue with a queue but ultimately that wasnt what I needed. I know for sure that the codeimageidcode gets upped by the code but it doesnt move on. Ive kept the codeactivecode function empty because I am not entirely sure what I want to do with this. I just needed a filler for the codetimeoutcode.

Negative 10193 pIm new to Cless than a week, and am trying to figure out a more effective way of retrieving data.  Basically imagine I have a few pieces of stock data Ticker, price, change.p  pMy approach so far has been to put all the data in 3 arrays.

It works fine but because I do a lot of lookups and my data doesnt change so I was wondering if there was maybe a more effective way of doing thisp  pI tried to look for a dictionaryhashmap to maybe store IBM as a key and a array of pricechange as values, but I cant seem to figure out how to do this in C.

Negative 10193 pI am trying to create an animation in javascript that is triggered by a mouseover event and then returns to the initial state on mouse out. When the user runs their cursor over an image on the page, another div with an initial height of 0px gradually rises in height to 50px over the bottom portion of the image. p  pThe problem I am facing is that when they move the cursor from the image to the div which now covers the bottom portion of the image, it triggers the mouseout as it is a separate element from the image and then a new mouseover event in quick succession because the div disappears when it detects that the cursor is no longer over the image meaning the div appears and disappears quickly, over and over again.p  pI am wondering how I would go about breaking such a loop so that the div does not disappear when the cursor runs over it from the image i.e. prevent the onmouseout event from triggering unless the mouse moves to some other element that is not the newly created div.p  pHeres an image to hopefully better illustrate the problemp  pa hrefhttpi.imgur.comqcE64.jpg relnofollowhttpi.imgur.comqcE64.jpga p
Negative 10193 pI am not sure if the question fits SOs guidelines, but I would like to know if there is a specific situation where I can use microframeworks.

Does this mean we can use microframeworks only for REST APIs and stuff which are almost always smaller part of a large project p

Negative 10193 pI am trying to use a report to print out a list of users with their name and unique id.  The kicker to the database I am using is that there is a field that active that denotes whether or not that user is still actively using the service.  For cases when a user is not active, I want to omit them from the report.p  pSo far I have tried setting the values of the fields equal to Null when the flag is encountered, but this leaves white space behind which makes the form look sparse and wastes space.p  pI have also tried setting the appropriate Visible field to False in VBA, but so far I am only able to make either columns or the whole report disappear. Is there any way to make it so that a row that represents a single user entry is not visiblep  pHere is the VBA code I have for this, fairly simple, I just need to figure out the right item to place in the line that says Hide Rowp  pNote [Active] links to the hidden data field on the form that links to my table telling whether or not the user is an active onep  pcode Private Sub DetailFormatCancel As Integer, FormatCount As Integerp  precodeIf [Active]  False Then     Hide Row End If codepre  pEnd Sub codep  pThanks in advancep  pdbriggsp

Negative 10193 pThis is more of a theory question than a solution question, so hear me out.p  pIn CC as well as PHP, you can declare constants. There are usually a couple of ways to do this codeDEFINEcode for example, or codeconst typecode... and the ultimate effect of this is that during compilation a replace is done so that all of those named constants become literals. This helps because instead of having to access a memory location to find the data, the data is hardcoded in, but without the downside of hardcoding  recalling the value if it needs to be reused, and changing all of the instances of that value when it needs to be changed.p  pBut Javas codefinalcode declaration is slightly inscrutable because I can create a class with unset final vars and initialize them on construction, it means that they are not precompiled as literals as far as I can tell. Other than guaranteeing that they cannot logically change afte construction, does the codefinalcode declaration provide any benefit to efficiency p  pReferences to articles are fine, as long as you make note of the part which explains what codefinalcode really does and what are if any its benefits other than stopping value changes after construction.p  pAs a corollary, is it possible to actually declare compilationlevel constants in Java in any other way than simply using literals a bad idea anywayp

Negative 10193 pstrongtldr general question about handling database data and designstrongp  pIs it ever acceptableare there any downsides to derive data from other data at some point in time, and then store that derived data into a separate table in order to keep a history of values at that certain time, OR, should you never store data that is derived from other data, and instead derive the required data from the existing data only when you need itp  pstrongMy specific scenariostrongp  pWe have a database where we record peoples vacation days and vacation day statuses.  We track how many days they have left, how many days theyve taken, and things like that.p  pOne design requirement has changed and now asks that I be able to show how many days a person had left on December 31st of any given year.  So I need to be able to say, Bob had 14 days left on December 31st, 2010.p  pWe could do this two ways I seep  ol lipA SQL Server Agent job that, on December 31st, captures the days remaining for everyone at that time, and inserts them into a table like YearEndHistories, which would have your EmployeeID, Year, and DaysRemaining at that time.pli lipWe dont keep a YearEndHistories table, but instead if we want to find out the amount of days possessed at a certain time, we loop through all vacations added and subtracted that exist UP TO that specific time.pli ol  pI like the feeling of certainty that comes with 1  the recorded values would be reviewed by administration, and there would be no arguing or possibility about that number changing.  With 2, I like the efficiency  one less table to maintain, and theres no derived data present in the actual tables.  But I have a weird fear about some unseen bug slipping by and peoples historical value calculation start getting screwed up or something.  In 2020 I dont want to deal with, I ended 2012 with 9.5 days, not 9.0  Where did my half day gop  pOne thing we have decided on is that it will not be possible to modify values in previous years.  That means it will never be possible to go back to the previous calendar year and add a vacation day or anything like that.  The value at the end of the year is THE value, regardless of whether or not there was a mistake in the past.  If a mistake is discovered, it will be balanced out by rewarding or subtracting vacation time in the current year.p

Negative 10193 pI have a JTree with a custom TreeModel and a custom TreeRenderer. The Tree Model contains a bunch of objects of different types.  One of these types is displayed differently than the others The displayed text is a concatenation of two fields of the object. When i edit the cell, I want to update one of these fields with the edited text. So far i got it working pretty well. p  pMy Problem It is confusing when the text, which is displayed while editing, is the complete concatenated value of 2 fields, even though youre in fact just editing one of the fields. So i want to display only the content of the one field youre editing when the user starts editing.p  pI tried to do this with a custom CellEditor, and I saw the way its supposed to work and the approach seems overkill in my case. I just want to alter the displayed text in one of many cases, so naturally I want to implement that, and not a whole CellEditor for the entire content of my Tree.p  pIs there a faster and easier way to do this, or do I have to use a custom editorp  pThanksp

Negative 10193 pWhen I compile with Compaq Visual Fortran, I get these errors when it starts the linker process that should be located in a .lib file I thought I added to the workspacep  precodeX30XFULL.OBJ  error LNK2001 unresolved external symbol BCON4 X30XFULL.OBJ  error LNK2001 unresolved external symbol RCON16 codepre  pAccording to where Ive googled about, it looks like Compaq Visual Fortran Version 6, FYI cant find the library files... p  pMy main question is, how do I use them Could there possibly be other missing files Here is what Ive triedp  ul liRight ClickAdding the files in the FileView windowli liGoing under ProjectSettings, Clicking the Link tab, and under the input category, adding the library files under objectlibrary modules bprop.lib rprop.lib and having the Additional Library Path point to where the files are. I also did this under the Resources tab and where it says Additional Resource Include Directories, I put the directory of where these files were located.li liTo cover my bases, I also put these files in where the project workspace file, where the compiled executable file would be generated, and pretty much any place I could think of that CVF might possibly look to in order to find these files. li ul  pstrongA little backgroundstrongp  pI have this Fortran executable that was last compiled in the 90s. From my research, its a 16bit compiled one which wont work on a 64bit machine.p  pThe original code has, at least from what we can gather, 16 bit compiled libraries. Without the original compiler, we cant figure out how to look at or use them. We also have a semiequivalent library file thats actually a .FOR file. For all we know, the BPROP.FOR and BPROP.LIB could be the same file they were found in the same source code area. If we use the BPROP.FOR file, the program can compile, but we are having issues with results that weve traced down to information that is usedgatheredprocessed in that file. p  pHowever, we do have 32bit versions of what we think are the same .lib files. So, were trying to use that, which is what is being used to compile the Fortran executable which results in the errors above.p

Negative 10193 pIm looking for a good explanation of the need to use multithreading in graphical applications. In the examples below Python is used but the question is not python specific it applies to maybe the general design of graphical programming in any language.p  pLets take a simple example. Lets assume there is an application that does some sort of time consuming operation on a collection of files, and that it outputs its progress to the console. Lets assume that this operation takes 2 seconds per file and that there are 10 files to process called 1.txt, 2.txt,3.txt, ... 10.txt. Then an example implementation could look like the followingp  pstrongconsolestrongp  precodeimport time def processfile     print processing 0....formatfile     time.sleep2.0 simulate slow operation  files  [0.txt.formati for i in range1, 11] mapprocess, files codepre  pThe console example is of course single threaded and does the job just fine. Now if we wanted to add a graphical progress bar a single threaded implementation might look like the followingp  pstrongsinglethreaded guistrongp  precodeimport time, gtk, gobject  def processfile     print processing 0....formatfile     time.sleep2.0  class MainWindowgtk.Window     def initself         superMainWindow, self.init         self.progress  gtk.ProgressBar         self.progress.setfraction0         self.addself.progress         self.connectdestroy, gtk.mainquit         self.showall         files  [0.txt.formati for i in range1, 11]         gobject.timeoutadd100, self.submit, files, 0      def submitself, files, i         processfiles[i]         self.progress.setfractioni  1.0lenfiles         if i  1 lt lenfiles             gobject.idleaddself.submit, files, i  1  win  MainWindow gtk.main codepre  pThis seems to work fine, but as you run the application if you try and interact with the application like try and resize the window for example it will get stuck and only respond every two seconds when it gets freed up to process pending gui events. The final example is a multithreaded implementation and stays responsive throughout execution.p  pstrongmultithreaded guistrongp  precodeimport time, gtk, gobject, threading  def processfile     print processing 0....formatfile     time.sleep2.0  class MainWindowgtk.Window     def initself         superMainWindow, self.init         self.progress  gtk.ProgressBar         self.progress.setfraction0         self.addself.progress         self.connectdestroy, gtk.mainquit         self.showall         files  [0.txt.formati for i in range1, 11]         threading.Threadtargetself.submit, argsfiles,.start      def submitself, files         for i, file in enumeratefiles             processfile             gobject.idleaddself.progress.setfraction, i  1.0lenfiles             if not self.getvisible                 return  gtk.gdk.threadsinit win  MainWindow gtk.main codepre  pIt seems perfectly clear and logical to me that if you have a longrunning blocking operation in your code and you want a responsive gui that you have to use a multithreaded solution. There is no other way around it. Is this the case I have tried to explain this many times to fellow developers but many dont understand or dont agree. Can someone provide an explanation of this concept, a link to an article on it, or correct me if my understanding is incorrect. p
Negative 10193 pA JLabel containing HTMLtext automatically wraps lines using the available space. If one adds that JLabel to a JSrollPane he has to set the preferredSize to a decent value otherwise it wont wrap. All this should work fine along other Components inside a JPanel using a LayoutManager.p  pCause I want a resizeable application window I extended JScrollPane to keep track of the resize events and dynamically change the size synced to the width of the viewport. Basically it works but sometimes the calculation of the preferred height by the layout manager is wrong value too big or too small. For instance the visibility of the red border cutting through the first line indicates that the calculation of the height is wrong.p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comufVMD.png altframegrabbingp  pI cannot reproduce the failure with a single wrapping JLabel.p  precodeimport java.awt.Color import java.awt.Container import java.awt.Dimension import java.awt.GridBagConstraints import java.awt.GridBagLayout import java.awt.event.ComponentEvent import java.awt.event.ComponentListener import javax.swing.BorderFactory import javax.swing.JFrame import javax.swing.JLabel import javax.swing.JPanel import javax.swing.JScrollPane import javax.swing.SwingUtilities  public class WrappedLabel implements Runnable       public static void main String[] args          SwingUtilities.invokeLater new WrappedLabel            Override     public void run         final JPanel panel  new JPanel new GridBagLayout          final GridBagConstraints gc  new GridBagConstraints         gc.fill  GridBagConstraints.BOTH         gc.weightx  1.0         gc.weighty  1.0                      gc.gridx  0             gc.gridy  0             final JLabel label  new JLabel                 lthtmlgt  please add some more text here                          label.setBorder BorderFactory.createLineBorder Color.RED               panel.add label, gc                                gc.gridx  0             gc.gridy  1             final JLabel label  new JLabel                 lthtmlgt  please add some more text here                          label.setBorder BorderFactory.createLineBorder Color.RED               panel.add label, gc                   final JFrame frame  new JFrame         frame.add new ScrollPane panel           frame.setDefaultCloseOperation JFrame.DISPOSEONCLOSE          frame.setSize 256, 256          frame.setVisible true            private class ScrollPane extends JScrollPane implements ComponentListener           ScrollPane Container view              super view              this.viewport.addComponentListener this                    Override         public void componentHidden ComponentEvent ce                    Override         public void componentMoved ComponentEvent ce                     calculating required height is a 3 step process            1. sync width of client and viewport, set height of client to high value            2. let GridbagManager calculate required minimum size            3. set preferredSize and revalidate                   Override         public void componentResized ComponentEvent ce              assert this.viewport  ce.getSource              final Container view  Container this.viewport.getView             final int width  this.viewport.getExtentSize.width             view.setPreferredSize new Dimension width, Integer.MAXVALUE               final int height  view.getLayout.preferredLayoutSize view .height             view.setPreferredSize new Dimension width, height               view.revalidate                   Override         public void componentShown ComponentEvent ce                   codepre

But suppose the server goes down in the middle of the hand.

Negative 10193 pMy Google App Engine app, which uses the Channel API works well some of the time. Intermittently, though, the js code connecting to the channel generates an error. In socket.onError, the error code is set to 400 and the description is set to an empty string. I have checked that the token being used to connect is valid. I also tried recreating the channel in socket.onError, by first calling socket.close but that does not seem to work. Often there is a series of failures before a success. The client js is running on Safari on iOS. Any ideas on how to fix or work around the problem will be welcome. Right now, my best workaround is to keep trying till I succeed, increasing the interval between attempts on each failure. The server side presence API does not help, since the connected hook is not called reliably. p

Negative 10193 pSo I am building an application in ASP.NET MVC which will render a form completely dynamically  in a way that there will eventually be a WYSIWYG forms designer available to configure a page. The page data like which controls and where they are placed will live in an XML file which is stored in the database. For now, none of that matters but I hope this gives insight as to what I am trying to accomplish.p  pI am new to ASP.NET MVC, and am digging through some existing projects. I found a very slick one here httpmvcdynamicforms.codeplex.com which accomplishes my goals.p  pBut the View is very stupid and the Model is very smart  the View only calls a RenderHtml method on the Model, which returns all the HTML needed for the page it loops throgh some controls collection and calls a seperate RenderHtml method on each one. I did send a question to the owner of that project asking why he went that way, but the strategy I would still want to go with isp  ul lithe Model will be very dumbli lithe Controller will stuff a List into the Modelli lithe View will decide how to render these things onto the pageli ul  pMy questions arep  ol liDo you see anything wrong with my above strategyli liDo you see any pitfalls of the alternative, intelligent model strategy used in this other projectli ol  pThanksp

Negative 10193 pI was curious about how PHP scripts and MySQL behave The script is basically two SQL queries.p  pThe first SELECTs and gets a number from a column of a specific row decided by some id.p  pThen if the number is positive the second UPDATES the column by subtracting a certain amount.p  pObviously this a classic case where I would use transactions or lock or mutexes or what on.p  pstrongMy questions is thisstrong In a website it is entirely possible for two or more users to call the script at the same time for the same row. If you dont use transactions or lock tables how will PHP process this They are two queriesfunction calls but they are in one script. Does it wait the whole script to return to its corresponding user to run it again for another user or because they are different queries because of pseudoparallelism it might run the first query on multiple user calling the same script and then the second for a different set..p  pBasically I am asking because I am doing something where I dont have enough permissions to use transaction or locks and I want to know if I can a avoid a mutex I am not sure about the word, basically a new table for callers before calling the script above I will call a new script before that where I will turn the boolean column of the table true for writing so other people cant while the original script finishes and afterwards bacl to false so the next in line can do and so onp  pstrongEditstrong I am not sure about select for update whether the permissions for that are included in the above mentioned. The guy responsible for answering my questions is hard to find and I ve had it with me searching for him...p

Negative 10193 pHello I am curious about APIs for determining the context of words in sentencesp  pEver since I saw the emergence of sentiment aggregators  scripts which tried to assess the sentiment of a sentence  I have been wondering about more complex versions of this. Basically the sentiment aggragators I saw are actually very simple, they just try to assign a positive and negative value to a sentence, but still do not know the context. Similarly I have been disappointed by the current progress of machines detecting contextp  pI was thinking a more complex algorithm would assign many more attributes to a word and compare them to other wordsp  pexamplep  pcodeThe quick brown fox jumped over a lazy dog.codep  pthe word fox would be interpreted as an objectp  precode     word fox,     type noun,     relation ...  codepre  pwhere it now knows that fox is referring to the mammal, and not the verb to baffle of deceive, for instance, and this would be useful for translating into another language or judging a good response for a robotp  pare there any good APIs for this, or open source projectsp

Negative 10193 pWhat I currently havep  pOn form sumbit I call a new php page which executes wkhtmltopdf with the php exec command by passing it the name of the file the form is in.  Ex. form is in test.php, onsubmit calls complete.php, complete.php has a line execwkhtmltopdf test.php test.pdf  This correctly generates the pdf based on the initial setup of my main page.p  pThe Problemp  pMy form has checkboxes that showhides s.  It also has a comment box.  When I run the wkhtmltopdf on the main php file it only takes the initial setup.  I want the wkhtmltopdf to create a pdf with the checkboxes shown and comment fields filled out.p  pPossible Solutionsp  p1 On form submit, it would create an identical php file with javascript hard coding the selections into the file, thus when wkhtmltopdf calls it the initial setup of the page is the filled out page.p  p2 Ive vaguely read that wkhtmltopdf supports using the forms data in the pdf that it makes but it does not work to me.  Id assume that is because I call a new page that then executes the command for wkhtmltopdf.  But even if I put it in the same page calling the file, I would assume still grabs the initial condition.p  pThe Questionp  pSo with both of those solutions, I dont know how to do them or if they are even possible.  So my question is will either of these work or does someone have a better idea how to do thisp

Negative 10193 pIm developing a little web application, which fetches binary image data encapsulated in XML nodes by XHR. My current web application is using ArrayBuffers, ArrayBufferViews and Blobs to generate blob urls to show the fetched images in my html documents, which works perfectly fine. I need to support the Internet Explorer 9 sigh, which doesnt support ArrayBuffers, ArrayBufferViews, Blobs or even TypedArrays. p  pI found an answer regarding ArrayBuffers and TypedArrays here a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions16545286internetexplorererrorscript5009arraybufferisundefinedInternet Explorer Error  SCRIPT5009 ArrayBuffer is undefineda p  pBut what about Blobs Any suggestions here Or maybe a hint for a clever workaround p  pThanks in advancep
Negative 10193 pI need to run a query that will give me the list of all entries in one column that is NOT LIKE any of the entries in another column, i.e.p  precodeSELECT DISTINCT columnA FROM tableA WHERE columnA NOT LIKE SELECT columnB FROM tableA codepre  pObviously, the above query doesnt work, Im providing it only in the hopes that it will clarify what Im trying to achieve. So, as an example, say that my columns contain the followingp  precodeCOLUMNA ABCD ABCE BCDE BCDF BCDEF GHIJ GHIK  COLUMNB ABC DEF HIJ codepre  pMy desired results would bep  precodeBCDE BCDF GHIK codepre  pThere are a total of 396 values in column in the table, so just entering the values manually is not feasible. In addition, as noted in the example, the values in columnB would always be substrings of the values in columnA, so I also need to have my query do the comparison with that in mind.p  pThanks in advance for any help anyone can offer, and also apologies if this question has already been answered elsewhere  I did a search but wasnt able to find anything that I could interpret as addressing this specific requirement.p  pemstrongem ADDING NEW INFO ememstrongp  pSo, as noted, I made a HUGE mistake in that the two columns are in different tables. That said, though, it was easy enough to modify califaxs suggestion below as followsp  pSELECT DISTINCT COLUMNA FROM TABLE1 T1 LEFT JOIN TABLE2 T2 ON T1.COLUMNA LIKE   T2.COLUMNB   AND T2.COLUMNB IS NULLp  pHowever, its still returning the full list of entries from COLUMNA. Ive confirmed that there are entries in COLUMNB that are substrings of the entries in COLUMNA  any ideas why this isnt filteringp  pThanks.p

Negative 10193 h2The Problemh2  pThis answer has been answered before but are old and not up to date. I have over 2000 lines of code in a single file, and as we all know this is bad practice, especially when im looking through code or adding new features. I want to better organize my code, for now and for the future. p  pI should mention that Im building a tool not a simple website with lots of buttons, UI elements, drag, drops, action listenershandlers and function in the global scope where several listeners may use the same function.p  h3Example codeh3  precodebutton1.onclick, functione      Determined action.     updatehtml   ...  Around 75 more of this  function updatehtml ....   ... codepre  pa hrefhttppastebin.comPrbwanNZMore example codea p  h3Conclusionh3  pI really need to organize this code for best use and not to repeat myself and be able to add new features and update old ones. I will be working on this by myself. Some selectors can be 100 lines of code others are 1. I have looked a bit at coderequire.jscode and found it kinda repetitive, and actually writing more code than needed . Im open to any possible solution that fit this criteria and link to resource  examples are always a plus.p  pThanks.p
Negative 10193 pIm building a webapp that has a mobile app companion.  The mobile app can be used in offline mode.p  pWhat is the best way to keep the central database and the local database on the client apps in syncp  pIn this case, changes could be happening in the webapp and also on the local app in offline mode.  How do I make sure that when a network connection is available, that both databases are in sync.p  pKeep in mind that the local app would only have a subset of the data.  Ie.. only data pertinent to that user.p  pThis seems like a common use case for apps.  Is there an available framework for thisp  pThank you.p

Negative 10193 pI am trying to create a unique identifier that can be stored as a BIGINT within a table.p  pI am working with the preexisting table that uses a BIGINT for a unique identifier. The database itself does not generate the identifier rather an external program that inserts the values does this. I need to insert my own values into this table and in doing so need to generate a unique identifier that is BIGINT24.p  pI was thinking of using codeSELECT UTCTIMESTAMP  0code but microseconds are not included in the version of MySQL I am using out of my control.p  pSo after some research it looks as though codeSELECT UUIDShortcode would be the better way to go. However I am concerned that the precision wont be enough.p  pIf I use codeSELECT UUIDSHORTcode Is there a way to check , before insertion, that the value from codeUUIDShortcode does not already exist in the table I should mention that I would really like to do all this in SQL so I can create an event in the database that will run once every 24 hours. The number of inserts each time the event runs is about 60 records so I dont believe performance will be an issue.p
Negative 10193 pIm creating an app for iOS that consumes an API Ive created, which requires authentication and authorization of users. Im thinking of using OAuth to let the mobile users do this with Facebook. This is an internal API that isnt meant to be exposed to third parties.p  pAnyway, Im a little confused about the abilities and limitations of OAuth consumers versus OAuth providers. Basically, I want to implement Login with Facebook functionality from the iOS app. It seems to me that this implies that my API should be an OAuth consumer, but the problem with this is that the login flow for a web app assumes a browser  an codeNSURLConnectioncode instance isnt going to know what to do with an HTML login page, and even if the redirect to the login page was made to work by prefixing the redirect URI with the codefbcode schema, surely the login form is going to pass the authorization token back to the iOS app and not my APIp  pSo my question is is there a way to implement my API as an OAuth consumer If not, and I should implement it as an OAuth provider, what does logging in with credentials from another provider like Facebook even meanp

Negative 10193 pThis is giving me some trouble... I dont quite understand whats happening. This is a Data Structures assignment and I have created every class as specified per the instructors UML diagram. This seems like an odd implementation of linked lists. I dont quite understand the constructor in the ListNode class calling another constructor and I dont understand why a counter wasnt specified to keep track of items in the list. I also dont understand the exception class I wrote as the instructor specifies that the second constructor calls the superclass constructor, and sends the following string as its argument  name   is empty  I just left that empty. I dont quite see how this works. I also completely have no clue how generics work. I did some reading but that didnt clear up much. Ill post my code and any help would be appreciated.

Negative 10193 pIs it possible in Jackrabbit to restrict same name name siblings, without fully defining the types of my nodes I am looking I guess for a simple CND definition that I can apply to my repository and use as the type of all of my nodes.p  pI am trying to follow the guidelines here a hrefhttpwiki.apache.orgjackrabbitDavidsModel relnofollowhttpwiki.apache.orgjackrabbitDavidsModela, specifically, 1 avoiding creating a strong schema upfront, but I find this to be incompatible with 4, avoiding same name siblings.p  pI can manually avoid same name siblings, by locking the relevant parent node collection, and checking for a node with the same name manually, and I will probably do this anyway in order to present application level error messages, but Id prefer an additional layer of protection against inconsistency.p  pAlso, I found this documentp  pa hrefhttpwww.day.comspecsjcr1.04.3.2SupportforSameNameSiblingsisOptional.html relnofollowhttpwww.day.comspecsjcr1.04.3.2SupportforSameNameSiblingsisOptional.htmlap  blockquote   pThough there is a required set of node types that every compliant repository must support, strongnone of these required node types allow samename siblingsstrong and any further node types available in a particular repository are implementationspecific.

Negative 10193 pSo I wanted to get the bootstrap 3 navbars links justifiedcentered.

But the links are not centered, theyre pulled to the left.p  pThe second navbar does have the code.navjustifiedcode so the links are centered, however when using mobile view the links are still centered, and not listed vertically like the first navbar.p  pDo you have any suggestions on how to fix thisp  pa hrefhttpjsfiddle.netXKPpT relnofollowJsfiddle Hereap

Negative 10193 pI have written a Java7Application that creates a BufferedImage that gets drawn on by a background thread whenever the user changes something that has influence on the image. The problem is that when displaying the image, the correct image gets shown only for a few seconds, then an erratic imgage in the right size with rests of the frame buffer from the system is shown see image on imgur, on the right. p  pa hrefhttpi.imgur.coml3O8IjD.jpg relnofollowhttpi.imgur.coml3O8IjD.jpgap  pHere is what it should look like a hrefhttpi.imgur.comAFWZIzz.png relnofollowhttpi.imgur.comAFWZIzz.pngap  pAs soon as the drawing thread has finished, the BufferedImage will be drawn onto a JPanel component after being transformed with an AffineTransformation to reflect a certain zoom level. p  pThe size of the BufferedImage is determined by a fixed number that is not dependent on the resolution of the MacBook or the JFrame usually quite high, something like 4000x2000. The panel in which the BufferedImage gets drawn is inside a ScrollPanel that adjusts to the size of the Panel. It does not matter whether the BufferedImage is written over or created new each time a new version is drawn by the thread.p  pI have tested the tool on windows, a MacBook without retina display and three MacBooks with retina display, on all machines without retina display, the tool works perfectly. Any ideasp  pEdit This is how the program works The class emHexaVisExplorer.javaem is the JFrame GUI built with NetBeans of the project. It keeps a ScrollPane, and a emVisualizationPanel.javaem that is the content of the ScrollPane, and whenever the user changes a property that has influence on the resulting image, the ActionListener for the component calls a method in the VisualizationPanel. There, a property is set and a Thread gets initialized and started that, based on the properties set in emVisualizationPanel.javaem, will draw a new BufferedImage. When this is done, the new BufferedImage will be saved to the emVisualizationPanel.javaem, which then will be repainted with an overridden paintComponent, where the image will be transformed using a emjava.awt.geom.AffineTransformem ation for efficient zooming.

Any suggestionsp  pIt was easy to display the data when the codeentriescode and codevaluescode were represented by a single table entries were rows, values were columns. But in that case, the maximum number of categories was limited by the number of columns in my table. I prefer how the normalized approach allows each tracker to represent an arbitrary number of categories.p

The difference, however, seems to me that the OP already knows beforehand the returnparameters the functions he will be using.

Negative 10193 pI have data in MS SQL 2008 R2 which I want to encrypt and then transport to a MySQL 5.5 database.  The reason for the encryption is that I do not completely trust the transport layer, and also that this data is rather sensitive so it would be best to store it in encrypted format.  The data is created and updated in MS SQL Server 2008 but only needs to be used for select in MySQL.p  pThe challenge that I have run into is that AES algorithm in MS SQL Server 2008 R2 is evidently not the same as MySQL 5.  It adds padding to the content, changes the values depending on whether the original data is encoded as UTF8 or UNICODE, and evidently has some 16 bit random vector that is added into the hash.  p  pCan you advise on possibly other encryptiondecryption algorithms that would be identical in MS SQL Server 2008 R2 and MySQL 5.5p

Negative 10193 pThis might seem like a weird question to ask, but is there a convention on how to order arguments in a constructor, and especially where to add arguments the constructor gains in subclasses It seems to me there should be one, after I found myself reading code like this Code is Groovy, but thats not really relvent to the questionp  precodeclass Matter      double volume     double mass      Matter double m, double v          mass  m volume  v        class Food extends Matter      double nutrition      Food double m, double v, double n          super m,v nutrition  n        class Apple extends Food      double sweetness      Apple double s, double m, double v, double n          super m,v,n sweetness  s         class GreenApple extends Apple      double acidity      GreenApple double a, double m, double n, double s, double v          super s,m,v,n acidity  a       codepre  pAs Ive illustrated above, once we have arrived at GreenApple, any order that might have once been there in the constructor arguments is gone. Note, however, that the programmers did not add their new arguments randomly  the author of Food believed that new arguments should be added in the back, the author of Apple believed that they should be added at the front, and the programmer of GreenApple thought the arguments should be sorted alphabetically, but together, they made the constructors fairly messy and type safety will be of no use here, these are all doubles.p  pCoincidentally well, not really, these are also the three conventions I though there might be. So, my question is now, is there a such a convention, and if there is, what is it And does it differ between languagesp

For example a button writes a value of 3 into the TextView, if this button was clicked again I want the TextView to increase to 6 and so on.p  pFurther to this I want to be able to have more than value added to the TextView from different buttons. I imagine this is more of a Java question as opposed to Android but seeing as Im a bit of a newbie to both all advice is welcomep

Negative 10193 pThis concept seems simple enough Create two separate applications, send encrypted text from the client to the server, then send a reply from the server to the client I assumed that I could simply establish a TcpClient connection between the two, get a NetworkStream, and use two CryptoStreams on that NetworkStreamone for read amp one for write. However, in my examples belowwhich are largely based on the MSDN example, text can be encrypted, sent to the server, decrypted and displayed just fine, but when the server attempts to reply, it throws Unable to write data to the transport connection.... Maybe the underlying stream is getting closed when the StreamWriter is closed By the way, this concept works perfectly fine when sending unencrypted text over the NetworkStream itself, as NetworkStreams are natively bidirectional.p  pEDIT It seems that closing the CryptoStream results in everything else being closed as well. If I manually call sendReply on the server after the client has sent a message, the server will reply successfullyas long as the NetworkStream has not been closed on the client. Then the server will throw Unable to read data from the transport connection A blocking operation was interrupted by a call to WSACancelBlockingCall. at SReader.Readline. Multiple CryptoStreams seem to work, so maybe the real problem is that the server doesnt know when to stop reading. Im not sure how to remedy that either.

Negative 10193 pI have been using the following formula to test whether or not a single entry in one column exists in a second columnp  precodeCOUNTIFE1E99504,I1gt0 codepre  pWhat I would like to be able to do is say that if the above formula evaluates to true, delete the duplicate entry from the second column i.e. the duplicate in the E1E99504 range, and shift the cells of this entry up.  I believe, aside from the cell shifting, this can be done without VBA.p  pHowever, I have 5 columns to compare in this particular case, with more possibly in the future.  As such I am trying to determine a way to perform the above operations on multiple columns using VBA.  Otherwise I would need to run the same process 10 times and I really feel like there is a more efficient way that I should learn.  The hierarchy of comparisons is as followsp  pSuppose we have columns A,B,C,D,E.  A is compared to B, then to C, then to D, where each time duplicates in the unfixed columns are removed while the entries in A remain.  Then B is fixed, moving through C,D, and E in the same manner and again entries in B are preserved.  Similarly until D is compared to E and the process is complete.  Has someone already made an algorithm that does this Any help would be appreciated. p

Negative 10193 pI have DI implemented using the constructor pattern in our MVC4 application, its been working perfectly for a couple of years now.p  pRecently, we had a contractor come in the do some work. He needed to access our services layer in a view model and hard coded the services and their repositories in the constructor of the viewModel, bad, bad, bad.p  pWhat he did was basically mess up our loose coupling we worked our buts off to implement and maintain.p  pTiming right now prevents us from rewriting his code at this time. p  pOur ViewModels are in a separate assemblyproject than the MVC application, as are our services layer and our repository layer.p  pSo far so good.p  pHow can i used dependency injection to resolve my services inside a view model.p  pI say again, INSIDE A VIEW MODEL, NOT INSIDE THE CONTROLLER Doesnt matter to me if it uses the property injection model or constructor injection model.p  pThanks in advance for any assistance.p

Negative 10193 pIm relatively new to using caching in larger programs intended to be used by a large number of people. I know what caching is and why its beneficial in general and Ive started to integrate EHCache into my application which uses JSP and Spring MVC. In my application the user selects an ID from a drop down list and this uses a java class to grab data from DB according to the ID picked. First the query is executed and it returns a ResultSet object. At this point I am confused at what to do and feel like Im missing something.p  pI know I want the object to go into cache if its not already in there and if its already in cache then just continue with the loop. But doing things this way requires me to iterate over the whole returned result set from the DB query, which is obviously not the way things are supposed to be donep  pSo, would you recommend that I just try to cache the whole result set returned If I did this I guess I could update the list in the cache if the DB table is updated with a new record Any suggestions on how to proceed and correctly put into ecache what is returned from the DBp  pI know Im throwing out a lot of questions and I certainly appreciate it if someone could offer some help Here is a snippet of my code so you see what I mean.p  precoders  sta.executeQueryQUERYBRANCHES  specifier            while rs.next                             for each set of fields retrieved, use those to create a branch object.

Negative 10193 pI am currently working on developing overtheair programming support on sky motes.  Attached are the files that I have so far.  I am basically trying to use the skyshellexec example to load my modified testdeluge.ce file onto the mote.  I then try to run the testdeluge file using the shell exec command as done in the skyshellexec example.br The final goal is to load both the testdeluge.ce and helloworld.ce compiled files onto the mote and then be able to exec my testdeluge.ce file which would then find the stored helloworld.ce file and do a delugedisseminate on it.p  pThe progression of command I am running are as followsp  precode1 sudo make TARGETsky clean CLEANsymbols. 2 sudo make skyshellexec.sky TARGETsky 3 sudo make skyshellexec.sky COREskyshellexec.sky TARGETsky 4 sudo make skyshellexec.upload COREskyshellexec.sky 5 sudo make compiletestdelugeexecutable 6 sudo make uploadtestdelugeexecutable 7 sudo make login  8 ls to see that the file made it 9 exec testdeluge.ce codepre  pAt this point I get a Symbol not found delugedisseminate errorp  pI believe the error is in the CORE... part of the make in step 2 above.  I have inspected the symbols.c file that is filled out in step 2 of the above and indeed there is no symbol for delugedisseminate or any of the deluge commands for that matter that I recall.  p  pFor experimentation I tried the following p  precodesudo make testdeluge.sky TARGETsky sudo make testdeluge.sky COREtestdeluge.sky TARGETsky codepre  pand I find that the symbols for deluge are there, but I cant proceed to properly make skyshellexec file since doing so erases the symbols table and writes a new one.p  pI feel like there must be a simple fix to this as I can run helloworld from the skyshellexec example directory after following the above steps 19.p  pDoes anyone have an idea of how to go about thisp  pNOTE  There may be a bug in my testdeluge.c where I try to open helloworld.sky instead of helloworld.ce...I wasnt really sure which one.  I havent been able to test this yet because of the missing symbol issue explained above, but if anyone would be willing to shed light on this issue as well I would be very appreciative.p  pThanksp  pstrongMAKEFILEstrongp  precodeCONTIKI  .... ifndef TARGET TARGETsky endif  APPS  deluge serialshell all blink skycollect rtleds testbutton testcfs tcprudolph0 all CONTIKIPROJECT  .tgz .ihex     mkdir basename lt       mv lt basename lt       echo basename ltbasename lt.ihex 600 gt basename ltrunfile       tar czf  basename lt  .class .java     javac basename lt.java  viewrssi ViewRSSI.class     make login  java ViewRSSI  include CONTIKIMakefile.include  .shellupload .ce     echo sleep 4 echo K sleep 4       echo dec64  write .ce  null sleep 4       ....toolsbase64encode lt lt sleep 4       echo  echo K echo read .ce  size sleep 4  make login  .PHONY compiletestdelugeexecutable uploadtestdelugeexecutable compilehelloworldexecutable uploadtestdelugeexecutable   compilehelloworldexecutable helloworld.ce     echo Compiled Contiki executable lt  uploadhelloworldexecutable helloworld.shellupload     echo Uploaded Contiki executable lt  compiletestdelugeexecutable testdeluge.ce     echo Compiled Contiki executable lt  uploadtestdelugeexecutable testdeluge.shellupload     echo Uploaded Contiki executable lt codepre  pstrongskyshellexec.cstrongp  precodeinclude contiki.h include shell.h include serialshell.h include deluge.h  include devwatchdog.h  include netrime.h include devcc2420.h include devleds.h include devlight.h include devsht11.h include devbatterysensor.h  include libcheckpoint.h  include netrimetimesynch.h  include ltstdio.hgt include ltstring.hgt  int keep1void  delugedisseminate int keep2void  nodeidburn   PROCESSskyshellprocess, Sky Contiki shell AUTOSTARTPROCESSESampskyshellprocess  PROCESSTHREADskyshellprocess, ev, data   PROCESSBEGIN   serialshellinit  shellblinkinit  shellfileinit  shellcoffeeinit  shellpsinit  shellrebootinit  shellrimeinit  shellrimenetcmdinit  shellrimepinginit  shellrimedebuginit  shellrimesniffinit  shellskyinit  shelltextinit  shelltimeinit    shellcheckpointinit  shellexecinit  shellbase64init   PROCESSEND   codepre  pstrongtestdeluge.cstrongp  precodeinclude contiki.h include cfscfs.h include deluge.h include sysnodeid.h include loaderelfloader.h include ltstdio.hgt include ltstring.hgt  ifndef SINKID define SINKID 1 endif  ifndef FILESIZE define FILESIZE 1000 endif  PROCESSdelugetestprocess, Deluge test process AUTOSTARTPROCESSESampdelugetestprocess  PROCESSTHREADdelugetestprocess, ev, data   static struct etimer et   nodeidburn2  PROCESSBEGIN   ifnodeid  SINKID     printfSink node trying to transmit file.n   else     printfNonsink node trying to recieve file.n     cfsremovehelloworld.sky  int fd  cfsopenhelloworld.sky, CFSWRITE  CFSREAD  iffd lt 0     processexitNULL    if 0  ifcfsseekfd, FILESIZE, CFSSEEKSET  FILESIZE     printffailed to seek to the endn   endif   delugedisseminatehelloworld.sky, nodeid  SINKID  cfsclosefd   etimersetampet, CLOCKSECOND  5  PROCESSWAITEVENTUNTILetimerexpiredampet  ifnodeid  SINKID     fd  cfsopenhelloworld.sky, CFSREAD    iffd lt 0       printffailed to open the test filen     else       printfStart dynamic loadingn      int ret  elfloaderloadfd      printfdn, ret        cfsclosefd       int i      switchret  case ELFLOADEROK  fori0 elfloaderautostartprocesses[i]  NULL i     printfexec starting process s. n,    elfloaderautostartprocesses[i]gtname    autostartstartelfloaderautostartprocesses          break  default  printfUnkown return code from ELF loader internal bugn           break               etimerresetampet   PROCESSEND   codepre  pstronghelloworld.cstrongp  precodeinclude contiki.h  include ltstdio.hgt  For printf   PROCESShelloworldprocess, Hello world process AUTOSTARTPROCESSESamphelloworldprocess  PROCESSTHREADhelloworldprocess, ev, data   PROCESSBEGIN   printfHello, worldn   PROCESSEND   codepre

Negative 10193 pI am trying to create an iOS app that will perform an action when it detects a clapping sound. p  pstrongThings Ive triedstrongp  pstrong1strong My first approach was to simply measure the overall power using an AVAudioRecorder. This worked OK but it could get set off by talking too loud, other noises, etc so I decided to take a different approach. p  pstrong2strong I then implemented some code that uses a FFT to get the frequency and magnitude of the live streaming audio from the microphone. I found that the clap spike generally resides in the 13kHZ20kHZ range while most talking resides in a lot lower frequencies. I then implemented a simple threshhold in this frequency range, and this worked OK, but other sounds could set it off. For example, dropping a pencil on the table right next to my phone would pass this threshhold and be counted as a clap. p  pstrong3strong I then tried splitting this frequency range up into a couple hundred bins and then getting enough data where when a sound passed that threshhold my app would calculate the ZScore probability from statistics and if the ZScore was good, then could that as a clap. This did not work at all as some claps were not recognized and some other sounds were recognized. p  pstrongGraphstrongp  pTo try to help me understand how to detect claps, I made this graph in Excel each graph has around 800 data points and it covers the 13kHZ21kHZ range img srchttpi.imgur.comuD8K1WZ.png1 altClapping Graphp  pstrongWhere I am nowstrongp  pEven after all of this, I am still not seeing how to recognize a clap versus other sounds.

Negative 10193 pI need to create a javascript application that can display the content from another domain admittedly another big website. Further interpretation of the DOM tree is not needed at the moment. It will be used by only ten more people. p  pI can make it work via phps getcontent function. But that is very slow since it runs on the server side. I looked into any origin but cannot get it to work. It is best to not touch any origin since we use it extensively and we dont have much cash to spend around. Can anyone help By the way, iframe is not an option since the big website blocked it. The code is below. Admittedly I kind of took it from another stackoverflow answer. Thank you in advancep  pBtw. another engineer told me if I use the extension .hta instead of html, the sameorigin policy issue would be resolved. I tried it and it did not work.

Negative 10193 pOne of the projects Im currently working on includes a Java Swing application for field users to input data about equipment parts scattered all over the companies facilities. Most of the data collected is measured field validation is required or some value the operator can choose from a predefined list.The software then does some calculation and displays back instructions to the operator.p  pso for example for part number 3435AfB, engineering requires the operator to measure  the diameter of some bolt and choose the part maker from a list. the application then compares the measured diameter to the stock diameter and tells the operator if it should be replaced this is obviously not a real world example, but you get the ideap  pThe problem is there are over 200 known equipment parts and these are pretty old and heterogeneous so the engineering team has a limited idea of what they would like to measure on each part in the future. It doesnt seam reasonable to have the development team write and maintain over 200 different classes but doesnt seem realistic to have the engineers use a complicated system of form builders and BPM like drools im getting sweaty just thinking about it.p  pWere currently trying to make a poor mans solution that would allow the engineers to build forms with a simple GUI having limited features and outputting the forms to XML files. The few complicated cases not covered by the GUI solution would be custom made by the developers very few cases. For the calculation part, we would use Java Expression library JEL, the expressions to evaluate would be generated by the same GUI.p  pBefore we commit to this solution, I was wondering if there is something we could do differently to have a more robust system. I know that some people will consider this too much softcoding and I agree that it is going to be difficult extracting and treating the data.p

Negative 10193 pJust prior to calling the Close method on a FileStream object, I unplug the underlying USB drive.  The Close method will throw an exception when it attempts to flush unwritten data.

It will attempt to flush unwritten data but encounters the same error, causing the application to terminate.p  pIs there a standard way to handle a failing Close invocation  It seems that if Close encounters an error you either 1 leak a file handle or 2 cause the application to terminate, neither of which is acceptable.p

Negative 10193 pIm writing a macro for a 2D game. The coordinates for the character are given, in x,y. There are obstacles in the game, so I need to program in a way that the character moves around it.p  pSo Ive written a program that reads the memory of x and y coordinates of the game. Then I wrote a function that moves the character to a desired position. The logic is if x coordinate is less than the desired position, keep moving right, and vice versa. Then, if y coordinate is less than the desired position, keep moving up, and vice versa. p  pHowever, because of the obstacles, I have to manually give the coordinates to move to. For example, if I was at 1,1, and told the character to move to 5,5, there might be an obstacle at 3,1 and the character will get stuck. So Ill tell it to move to 1,3 first, then move to 5,3, then 5,5.p  pIm just confused on how to SEQUENTIALLY tell the character to move.

If   you are sure youre not intentionally defining a core class, then this   is the most likely explanation of whats going on.p      pHowever, you might actually be trying to define a class in a core   namespace, the source of which you may have taken, for example, from a   nonAndroid virtual machine project. This will most assuredly not   work. At a minimum, it jeopardizes the compatibility of your app with   future versions of the platform. It is also often of questionable   legality.p      pIf you really intend to build a core library  which is only   appropriate as part of creating a full virtual machine distribution,   as opposed to compiling an application  then use the   corelibrary option to suppress this error message.p      pIf you go ahead and use corelibrary but are in fact building an   application, then be forewarned that your application will still fail   to build or run, at some point. Please be prepared for angry customers   who find, for example, that your application ceases to function once   they upgrade their operating system. You will be to blame for this   problem.p      pIf you are legitimately using some code that happens to be in a core   package, then the easiest safe alternative you have is to repackage   that code. That is, move the classes in question into your own package   namespace. This means that they will never be in conflict with core   system classes. JarJar is a tool that may help you in this endeavor.   If you find that you cannot do this, then that is an indication that   the path you are on will ultimately lead to pain, suffering, grief,   and lamentation.p blockquote  pClearly, Google are telling me, strongly, not to do this.p  pSo, how are you meant to build the Android v2.1.0 SDKp  pThanks Leep

Negative 10193 pIve got some code that runs a fairly complex algorithm.

I basically want to create a simple UI that displays the important values in the process as it runs dynamically.p  pIn this example, lets say that I just want to display two labels that contain the index values of the two leaders as the algorithm executes.p  pI created the labels in the storyboard.p  pThen, I created IBOutlets in the ViewController Actually, storyboards did it for me when I Ctrldraggedp  precodeclass ViewController NSViewController       IBOutlet weak var a NSTextField     IBOutlet weak var b NSTextField      override func viewDidLoad          super.viewDidLoad           Do any additional setup after loading the view.           override var representedObject AnyObject          didSet           Update the view, if already loaded.                codepre  pThen, I ctrldragged the labels to the a and b in the algorithm class to create the bindings.p  pFinally, I create an class variable in the view controller and instantiate it in the viewDidLoad method.  This doesnt seem like the right thing to do  maybe it is.  Seems like you would want to keep separate your interface and data...p  pThe labels do, in fact, show up  but they never show any values of a and b.

Negative 10193 pI have a table and its primary key is an identity column and I was using it as my folio to display its value on reports.p  pIf an codeinsertcode statement fails, SQL Servers default behavior is to autoincrement the seed of my identity column and because of that the user get confused when they have a report with folio 1000 and the next one is folio 1004 because maybe 3 inserts fails.p  pSo, what is the best way to create a folio column and manage it within a web applicationp  pIs it a good practice that before doing a save I go to my table and get my codefolio columncode, autoincrement that on server side and then save it to db for the new record Im worried about concurrency because what happens if in the same second 2 users get the same folio number, the issue will be that I will have 2 reports with the same number.p  pAppreciate any advice.p

I have a number of other sections in the document  including repeating parts  which are working fine, but their repeating sections arent nested. p  pIve already got the XML structure which should support the nesting, and as I worked my way down mapping these controls all was well, until I modified the XML to add more children to various nodes to test the repeating sections. In some cases it removed the entire sections, in others it repeated nested child nodes as parents, repeating entire tables.  brp  pstrongI guess the questions arestrongbr  1. If youve successfully nested repeating sections, how br  2. If youve run into these funky behaviors, how did you work around it br  3.

Negative 10193 pI need to implement strongUndo  Redostrong functionality using strongOpenLayers 3strong vector editing just like demonstrated in a hrefhttpdev.openlayers.orgexamplesmodifyfeature.htmlhttpdev.openlayers.orgexamplesmodifyfeature.htmla for OpenLayers 2.p  pTo keep track of emgeometryem changes of emfeaturesem, I have to manage a memory stack that will hold changed geometric definitions of features upon user interactions. I know OpenLayers 3 provides observable objects. So codeol.Featurecode or codeol.Feature.getGeometrycode can be observed for changes, but I am looking for explicit events emitted by codeol.interaction.Modifycode, that should notify me when the eminteractionem starts or ends the vector editing operation just like codebeforefeaturemodifiedcode and codefeaturemodifiedcode events in OpenLayers 2.p  pA handler listening for observed emgeometryem or emfeatureem changes can be used for the purpose but it is too expensive because emgeometryem of the feature under modification is changed with every pixel move.p  pI have gone through the official a hrefhttpopenlayers.orgenv3.0.0apidocdocumentationa of OpenLayers 3 but couldnt find various events that are provided by OpenLayers 2. In most cases the documentation mentions emchangeem event only. I wonder if such events are not a consideration for Openlayer 3s architecture. If it is so, any suggestions how can I extend the existing codeol.interaction.Modifycode to incorporate custom events thanks.p

Negative 10193 pFor a partial view I want to do some JavaScript stuff that I usually would do with codedocument.readyfunction ...code, e.g. bind venet listeners to elements. I know that this doesnt work for AngularJS and partial views loaded into the root view.p  pThus I added a listener to the controller that listens to the codeviewContentLoadedcode event. The listeners function is invoked, so the event is fired but it seems to me as if it is before the partial view is rendered.

Negative 10193 pIm pretty new to Jenkins and Buckminster and at the moment Im stuck wich my buildprocess. Im trying to understand how the Buckminster materializer works, which at the moment behaves not like I think it should.p  pSo far I have an Eclipse workspace with my codeOSGicode projects and an codeANTcode scrpit which builds everything I need. Instead of Eclipse OSGi I use a hrefhttpfelix.apache.org relnofollowApache Felixa. I installed the a hrefhttpscode.google.compfelixeclipse relnofollowApache Felix Eclipse plugina in my Eclipse. So far I understood, that Eclipse automatically resolves the org.osgi.framework package by copying all needed code.classcode files to the code.bincode folder in every project which needs classes from this package. Afterwards I run my codeANTcode script to build everything. This works fine so far.p  pNow I tried setting up this buildprocess on a emJenkingCIem and so far I understood, that I will need Buckminster to do the job of Eclipse. I already have an code.RMAPcode, code.CQUERYcode and code.MSPECcode file which I use to import the plugin mentioned above. Buckminster also manages to download materialize this jar to codeWORKSPACE.buckminsterau.com.forge.felix.eclipse.updatesite0.2.2.zipcode. Now I would expect that Buckminster does the job of Eclipse, which means extracting all code.classcode files from the jar and putting them somewhere, inside my projects.

Negative 10193 pI wrote this program and have all the code that it should need. At first I was having some runtime errors, but I easily fixed those. Now it shows no visible errors, and when I run it, it does nothing.p  pIn essence, what it should be doing is printing out a list of classes with students and id numbers, which have been merged from two files. It matches the ids of students to the ids of classes and forms them into a list. This all seems to be happening, it just isnt printing it out.p  pMy code is below. Please let me know what you think. I have included a description at the top and markers of where I think the issue starts and ends. Also after the code there is an example of the contents of the two files.p  precode This program reads in two files, one which contains a list of student names and id numbers,     and another which lists class id numbers.   Then, the data is taken into arrays which are then used in different sorts. One sorts the id numbers numerically, one sorts the students   alphabetically, and one sorts the class names alphabetically.The id numbers of students are matched to class and both are compiled into   a list which then prints out first the class name, then the list of students within it. All done alphabetically.       import java.io. import java.util.Scanner  public class MergingFiles     public static void mainString[] args throws IOException       String[][] studentArray  new String [1000][2]     String[][] classArray  new String[4000][2]     int count  0      Scanner sc  new Scannernew Filestudents.txt     whilesc.hasNextLine      String studentInput  sc.nextLine      String name  studentInput.substring0, 30.trim      String id  studentInput.substring30.trim      studentArray[count][0]  name      studentArray[count][1]  id      count           forint i  0 i lt count1 i sorts id number numerically       forint j  0 j lt count1i j         ifstudentArray[j][1].compareTostudentArray[j1][1] gt 0          String holder  studentArray[j][1]           studentArray[j][1]  studentArray[j1][1]            studentArray[j1][1]  holder                             int counter3  0      Scanner sc2  new Scannernew Fileclasses.txt      whilesc2.hasNextLine        int counter2  0        String classInput  sc2.nextLine         whileclassInput.charAtcounter2            counter2                String className  classInput.substring0, counter2        whileclassInput.charAtcounter2             counter2                String idNum  classInput.substringcounter2          int low  0        int high  count  1        int mid  high  low2  low         whileidNum.equalsstudentArray[mid][1] binary search          ifidNum.compareTostudentArray[mid][1] lt 0            high  mid  1           else            low  mid  1          mid  high  low2  low                 String studentName2  studentArray[mid][1]        classArray[counter3][0]  className        classArray[counter2][1]  studentName2        I THINK THE ISSUE STARTS HERE      forint a  0 a lt counter3  1 a sort class names alphabetically        forint b  0 b lt counter31a b          ifclassArray[b][0].compareToclassArray[b1][0] gt 0            String holder2  classArray[b][0]            classArray[b][0]  classArray[b1][0]             classArray[b1][0]  holder2                               forint c  0 c lt counter3  1 c sort class names alphabetically        forint d  0 d lt counter31c d          ifclassArray[d][0].compareToclassArray[d1][0]  0            ifclassArray[d][1].compareToclassArray[d1][1] gt 0              String holder3  classArray[d][1]              classArray[d][1]  classArray[d1][1]               classArray[d1][1]  holder3                                           String currentClass        forint s  0 s lt counter3 s        ifclassArray[s][0].equalscurrentClass          currentClass  classArray[s][0]          System.out.printcurrentClass                System.out.printclassArray[s][1]        THIS IS WHERE THE ISSUE ENDS                               codepre  pstudentArray contents example without s  p  precodeLambert, Desmond              451825335 Johnston, Michaela            143547061 Wells, Shirley                942366473  Blevins, Dawson               407183976  Roy, Benjamin                 575069268  Mitchell, Jaquan              285633099  Freeman, Nayeli               312234364  Benson, Myles                 755491358  Wilkinson, Stephany           384506082  Bradshaw, Nikki               159900631  Davila, Sarah                 788743448  Wyatt, Eddie                  253830483  Ortega, Josh                  891761169  Pruitt, Deven                 533987743  Harrison, Aliyah              710258372  Perez, Emerson                611325979  Stanton, Sonny                430095944  Rice, Bruce                   301915859  Callahan, Brandon             327995163  Torres, Jovan                 629852538  Mathis, Timothy               936191071  Calhoun, Nathanael            107519769  Mullen, Malik                 711847273  Sims, Marvin                  519717164  Pham, Siena                   530779316  Vincent, Demetrius            618276821 codepre  petc.p  pclassArray contents example without s p  precode ECON101 938597595  BUS100 951008337  ECON408 620903271  PHY101 695451867  COSC150 392023624  MATH215 557048539  COSC325 495522117  BUS215 185642398  ECON408 807662685  MATH215 920062540  MATH325 517786537  PHY150 915173832  BUS100 518392974  BUS408 410797598  BUS215 152414047  PHY150 561839967 codepre  petc.p  pThanks.p

Negative 10193 pI am currently looking for a way to synchronize confidential files between two PCs and possibly an always running raspberry pi  would serve as a host and backup.p  pOn each PC I have an LUKSencrypted partition. I want to synchronize the files in those partitions with the rpi, but I dont want to store them on rpi in clear text.br I think the only reliable way is to encrypt the files while still on the PC in every other way the files could be obtained as long as there is physical access to the rpi. One possible way is storing the files also in a encrypted partition of the rpi and sending the passphrase to the rpi every time I want to sync, but I did not find an extremely simple way to do this e.g. Unison doesnt over such a feature  the passphrase could be obtained by simple manipulations.br The second way I thought of was storing the files in an encrypted container an synchronizing the container, but with every little change the whole file would have to be uploaded to the rpi.p  pSo, is there a fast way to encrypt single files esp. only the changed ones and possibly combine it with synchronization right awayp  pI read emopensslem is one way of encrypting single files.p  pI dont know much about encryption or synchronization, but I want to find a way that is reasonably safe and not more than reasonably complex and doesnt use any external services...p  pThank you very much for reading and considering my question, Maxp  ol lipEdit One part that might solve my problem right awaybr If I use a container luks and change some files, will the changes in the container file be proportional to the changes I made in the files emANDem will rsync only transmit the changed parts of the big container filepli lipEdit After editing my question the first time I continued researching and found this article a hrefhttpwww.nixtutor.comlinuxoffsiteencryptedbackupsusingrsyncandaes relnofollowOff Site Encrypted Backups using Rsync and AESabr This article covers backing up files to a remote machine and encrypting them before transmitting them. The next step will be to compare files and use the more recent one. I can probably use a local sync mechanism which emrsyncem offers if there not an option for that already.pli lipEdit I finally found a hrefhttpsuperuser.comquestions322886truecryptrsynccontainerthis discussiona debating whether a emtruecryptem container could be synced via rsync.

Negative 10193 pAt the moment Im busy using the Azure Elastic Scale a hrefhttpazure.microsoft.comenusdocumentationarticlessqldatabaseelasticscaleoverviewsplitandmerge relnofollowsplitmerge examplea for an existing database of my customer.p  pIve defined a database schema, so its possible to do the splitmerge. However, theres 1 thing which gives me errors. This is having nested references to the shardlets the identifier to split on.p  pOn the documentation page of the splitmerge sample, theres the following example code to specify a database schemap  precode Create the schema annotations  SchemaInfo schemaInfo  new SchemaInfo    Reference tables  schemaInfo.Addnew ReferenceTableInfodbo, region  schemaInfo.Addnew ReferenceTableInfodbo, nation    Sharded tables  schemaInfo.Addnew ShardedTableInfodbo, customer, CCUSTKEY  schemaInfo.Addnew ShardedTableInfodbo, orders, OCUSTKEY    Publish  smm.GetSchemaInfoCollection.AddConfiguration.ShardMapName, schemaInfo  codepre  pThis code will probably work, because its rather straightforward. But what if theres another table, codeOrderLinescode, which has a codeFKcode to codeOrderscode, which in turn has an codeFKcode to codeCustomercode.p  pHow should you define the schema in such a situationp  pDo you have to specify the key between codeorderlinescode and codeorderscode This would make sense, I guess.p  precode Sharded tables  schemaInfo.Addnew ShardedTableInfodbo, customer, CCUSTKEY  schemaInfo.Addnew ShardedTableInfodbo, orders, OCUSTKEY  schemaInfo.Addnew ShardedTableInfodbo, orderslines, OLORDERKEY  codepre  pReason for me to ask is because the database Im working on has a lot of these nested relations to the shardlet and Im not sure on how to specify the schema. Ive already noticed specifying them as a codeReferenceTableInfocode isnt an option, because that way the tooling tries to insert the records before the FK relation between codeOrderLinescode and codeOrderscode is met.p

Negative 10193 pIve been testing a small Python Bottle web application that uses unicode so I ended up using Python 3 for ease. However Ive discovered Python 3 is not freeing up memory from discarded object instances and its bunging my webserver up. I set up a quick test in the two interpreters on my laptop to compare the results I used a number converted to a string because Python seems to optimise repeat data in a listp  precodeclass mybigobject     def initself         self.biglist  []         bignum  123456781234567812345678         for i in range1000000             self.biglist.appendstrbignum             bignum  1         time.sleep10  to give htop time to react to memory usage  def buildmybigobject     bigobj  mybigobject     return Object built codepre  pNow as I understand it when I run buildmybigobject it will create an object called bigobj with a list of numbers as a string 1 million elements long and then destroys the instance when the function ends. This takes my full system memory usage from 319MiB to 384MiB and then back down to 332MiB when the function ends in Python 2.7.p  pIn Python 3.2 it goes from 320MiB to 455MiB and stays there for 23 minutes then down to 446MiB until the interpreter is terminated. This happens on both my dev machine and as a WSGI daemon process on my Apache server. When running through Bottle the memory usage never goes down in Python 3 and just increases in size if the next object instance is larger. Ive tried purposely deleting the instance at the end of the function and using gc.collect with no success. Any ideas on how to deal with thisp

Negative 10193 pMy Gradle build signs almost 200 jars via the codeant.signjarcode task.

FYI This drops from 25 mins to 7 mins on  my Core Duo laptop 4x faster.p  pHowever, sometimes it runs successfully and sometimes it fails and I cant work out why.

Is there an easier way to print a text with a lot of wordsp  precode    sentence A Turing machine is a device that manipulates symbols on a strip of tape according to a table of rules. Despite its simplicity, a Turing machine can be adapted to simulate the logic of any computer algorithm, and is particularly useful in explaining the functions of a CPU inside a computer. The Turing machine was described by Alan Turing in 1936, who called it an automaticmachine. The Turing machine is not intended as a practical computing technology, but rather as a hypothetical device representing a computing machine.

Negative 10193 pI have an Express application running with MongoDB.  I want to separate out my database access from the server level.  However, to get the result of a database call I can only seem to do one of two thingsp  pstrongPass Res as an argumentstrongp  precodeserver.js ... var dbApi  require..datadbapi.js ... app.getapiuser, dbApi.getUsersfunction data    res.senddata  ...  dbapi.js ... getUsers function callback    MongoClient.connecturl, function err, db    if err      throw err       db.collectioncollections.Users     .find     .toArrayfunction error, documents        db.close       callbackdocuments          ... codepre  pstrongAssume Express reqres paradigm in dbapi.jsstrongp  precodeserver.js ... var dbApi  require..datadbapi.js ... app.getapiuser, dbApi.getUsers ...  dbapi.js ... getUsers function req, res    MongoClient.connecturl, function err, db    if err      throw err       db.collectioncollections.Users     .find     .toArrayfunction error, documents        db.close       res.senddocuments          ... codepre  pHowever, I feel both of these approaches add implicit dependencies I would prefer to avoid.  I would prefer to call dbApi independently in server.js such that it returns a result set I can manipulate before returning, i.e.p  precodeserver.js ... var dbApi  require..datadbapi.js ... app.getapiuser, function req, res    var result  dbApi.getUsers   do stuff with result as necessary   res.sendresult  ...  dbapi.js getUsers function     MongoClient.connecturl, function err, db    if err      throw err       db.collectioncollections.Users     .find     .toArrayfunction error, documents        db.close       return documents          codepre  pBut this last one doesnt seem to want to work, as the documents arent returned to the server level result is undefined.  I know this is because Im trying to do something synchronously that is inherently asynchronous.p  pSo, I suppose, what Im looking for is any advice on best practices regarding app architecture as it pertains to separating out the data access layer.p

Negative 10193 pIm trying to create a webpage in HTML5 using Notepad. When I open the page on my laptop it all fits the page well, I have thin red bars as images going across the page, which all fit the screen perfect. However when I open the image on my computer screen, which is larger, the images then dont fit the screen, and stop in the middle of the screen. This is the same with other images and text, which looks stretched. The if I set the sizes to fit my computer screen, they go over the correct position on my laptop. Can anyone help with this please, thanks.p

Negative 10193 pIn a primefaces dialog I show a form with some input fields initially. If the user clicks a button an image or pdf is opened and the dialog is separated with a playout.

What I do not understand is how the codeTableRowcode shows up in the layout at all since its codelayoutweightcode is 0 and the codeImageViewcodes codelayoutweightcode is 1. My understanding is that the way codelayoutweightcode works is it will first respect the codelayoutwidthcode and codelayoutheightcode of each element, and then divide up the remaning space between the elements based on codelayoutweightcode. But since the codeImageViewcode has codematchparentcode for both its codelayoutwidthcode and codelayoutheightcode, shouldnt it take up the whole screen and then leave nothing left to divide with the codeTableRowcode I believe that the codeTableRowcode also has codematchparentcode for both its codelayoutwidthcode and codelayoutheightcode attributes since it inherited them from codeTableLayoutcode, but since it came second I thought the codeImageViewcode would dominate the screen. Also, even if the the codeImageViewcode shouldnt take up the whole screen, arent the codelayoutweightscode saying that the codeImageViewcode should get 100 of the remaining space and the codeTableRowcode should get 0 Additionally, when I increase the codelayoutweightcode of the codeTableRowcode, the codeTableRowcode just gets pushed further and further off the screen as it increases more but I thought that this should increase the space the codeTableRowcode takes up on the screen. Can anyone explain what Im misunderstanding here.p  pIn case it helps, my understanding for codelayoutweightcode comes from this example in the bookp  precodeHow androidlayoutweight works ...  LinearLayout makes two passes to set the width of a view. In the first pass, LinearLayout looks at layoutwidth or layoutheight, for vertical orientation. The value for layoutwidth for both the Button and CheckBox is now wrapcontent, so each view will get only enough space to draw itself Figure 8.12.  ...  In the next pass, LinearLayout allocates any extra space based on the values for layoutweight. codepre

Negative 10193 pConsider the following array declarationp  precodeint const a[5] codepre  pFrom the semantic standpoint of the language, is it exactly equivalent to codeconst int a[5]code Assuming that is the case, both declarations would essentially read like ema is an array of 5 constant intsem.p  pThe alternative way to read the first declaration would be ema is a constant array of 5 intsem.p  pObviously, both of the statements logically imply that the whole array is constant if an array consists of 5 constant ints, then the entire array is constant. Alternatively, if the whole array is constant, then all of its values are also constant.p  pI am aware that the notion of a constant array is a bit meaningless since arrays are not modifiable lvalues that is, they cannot appear on the left side of an assignment. However, are there any circumstances under which these two declarations would yield different behaviourp  pa hrefhttpcdecl.org relnofollowCdecl.orga rejects the first declaration as a syntax error, while most current compilers accept it.p  pEDITp  pThe linked duplicate asks whether the order of codeconstcode matters for ordinary variables. With arrays, it is a bit more confusing, so I dont consider this a duplicate.p

I have all the transitions working correctly, and they are here  openclosed cssp  precodeinfo.hidden    opacity0   width0px   height10px    transition width .5s easeinout, height .5s easeinout, opacity .5s easeinout, visibility 0s linear .5s    with moz amp webkit    info.visible    width150px    transition width .5s easeinout, height .5s easeinout, opacity .5s easeinout    with moz amp webkit   codepre  pThe problem I have is that the small width during the transition causes the text to wrap, extending the height of the box and not having the desired effect.

Also on close the height jumps straight to 10px.p  pThis problem can be seen here a hrefhttpjsfiddle.netDaniel3001nhs9w78 relnofollowhttpjsfiddle.netDaniel3001nhs9w78a.p  pI have tried various things, including adding a wrapper div to the text, hoping that the wrapper div would overflow past the bottom or the side of the div during the transition.

Im using PostgreSQL, and yes I made sure under emTools  Install Softwareem, that it is running. p  pWhen I run coderuby app.rbcode in my terminal, Sinatra takes the stage at Port 4567, which Im able to view perfectly fine.p  pBut when I run coderackupcode, on the other hand, Sinatra takes the stage at Port 9292. Trying to preview at that port yields a HTTP Error 502 Bad Gateway status.p  pNote Im unable to post within the Codio Community forums at the momenttheir system doesnt seem to realize Im logged in when I go into their forums page, and it wont let me log in. Im standing by for help from them on that. Until then, I figured Id reach out here on StackOverflow.p

Negative 10193 pTaking MySQL as an example DB to perform this in although Im not restricted to Relational flavours at this stage and Java style syntax for model  db interaction.p  pId like the ability to allow versioning of individual column values and their corresponding types as and when users edit objects. This is primarily in an attempt to drop the amount of storage required for frequent edits of complex objects.p  hr  pA simple example might bep  precode  Food Table       id INT       name VARCHAR255       weight DECIMAL  codepre  pSo we could insert an object into the database that looks like...p  precodeFood banana  new FoodBanana,0.3 codepre  pgiving usp  precode  id   name   weight     1  Banana  0.3      codepre  pif we then want to update the weight we might usep  precodebanana.weight  0.4 banana.save    id   name   weight     1  Banana  0.4      codepre  hr  pObviously though this is going to overwrite the data.p  pI could add a revision column to this table, which could be incremented as items are saved, and set a composite key that combines idversion, but this would still mean storing ALL attributes of this object for every single revision p  precode Food Table        id INT        name VARCHAR255        weight DECIMAL         revision INT    id   name   weight  revision     1  Banana  0.3            1    1  Banana  0.4            2   codepre  pBut in this instance were going to be storing every single piece of data about every single item. This isnt massively efficient if users are making minor revisions to larger objects where Text fields or even BLOB data may be part of the object.p  hr  pWhat Id really like, would be the ability to selectively store data discretely, so the weight could possible be saved in a separate DB in its own right, that would be able to reference the table, row and column that it relates to.p  pThis could then be smashed together with a VIEW of the table, that could sort of impose any later revisions of individual column data into the mix to create the latest version, but without the need to store ALL data for each small revision.p  precode  id   name   weight     1  Banana  0.3         ID   TABLENAME  COLUMNNAME  OBJECTID  BLOBDATA  REVISION    456  Food        weight               1  0.4               2   codepre  pNot sure how successful storing any data as blob to then CAST back to original DTYPE might be, but thought since I was inventing functionality here, why not go nuts.p  pThis method of storage would also be fairly dangerous, since table and column names are entirely subject to change, but hopefully this at least outlines the sort of behaviour Im thinking of.p

Negative 10193 pI am trying my hand in Spring security. I am using Spring data with custom controllers and resourceprocessors. And I protect my controllers using the strongemPreAuthorizeemstrong annotation.p  pIn my resourceprocessor, I use the ControllerLinkBuilder and use the strongemlinkToemstrong and strongemmethodOnemstrong to construct the links. I am aware that the resourceprocessor doesnt actually execute the controller method but just creates a proxy and creates an invocation during the link construction.p  pMy question is  can the resourceprocessor be made capable of recognizing the strongemPreAuthorizeemstrong annotation on the controller so that depending on the roles of the principal that invoked the controller, the resourceprocessor only creates links that the principal is authorized to see or do something with it and skips the rest of the linksp  pThanks,p
