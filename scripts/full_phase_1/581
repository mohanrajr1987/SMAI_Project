Positive 581 pWhile coding earlier I noticed something strange about SHA256, in that it seems to generate more integers than letters for the hash. At first I thought I was just imagining it, so I put together a quick test to make sure. Astonishingly, my test seems to prove that SHA256 favors integer values in the hash that it generates. I want to know why this is. Shouldnt the difference between a hash index being a letter and a number be the exact same Here is my testing examplep  precodenamespace TestingApp      static class Program              private static string letters  abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ1234567890         private static char[] characters  letters.ToCharArray         private static Random rng  new Random          static void Mainstring[] args                      int totalIntegers  0             int totalLetters  0             for int testingIntervals  0 testingIntervals lt 3000 testingIntervals                              string randomString  NextString10                 string checksum  DreamforceChecksum.GenerateSHA256randomString                 int integerCount  checksum.CountChar.IsDigit                 int letterCount  checksum.CountChar.IsLetter                 Console.WriteLineString   randomString                 Console.WriteLineChecksum   checksum                 Console.WriteLineIntegers   integerCount                 Console.WriteLineLetters   letterCount                 totalIntegers  integerCount                 totalLetters  letterCount                          Console.WriteLineTotal Integers   totalIntegers             Console.WriteLineTotal Letters   totalLetters             Console.Read                   private static string NextStringint length                      StringBuilder builder  new StringBuilder             for int i  0 i lt length i                              builder.Appendcharacters[rng.Nextcharacters.Length]                          return builder.ToString                codepre  pand my checksumhashing classp  precodeusing System using System.Collections.Generic using System.Linq using System.Security.Cryptography using System.Text using System.Threading.Tasks  namespace DreamforceFramework.Framework.Cryptography      public static class DreamforceChecksum              private static readonly SHA256Managed shaManagedInstance  new SHA256Managed         private static readonly StringBuilder checksumBuilder  new StringBuilder         public static string GenerateSHA256string text                      byte[] bytes  Encoding.UTF8.GetBytestext             byte[] hash  shaManagedInstance.ComputeHashbytes             checksumBuilder.Clear             for int index  0 index lt hash.Length index                              checksumBuilder.Appendhash[index].ToStringx2                          return checksumBuilder.ToString                   public static byte[] GenerateSHA256Bytesstring text                      byte[] bytes  Encoding.UTF8.GetBytestext             byte[] hash  shaManagedInstance.ComputeHashbytes             checksumBuilder.Clear             for int index  0 index lt hash.Length index                              checksumBuilder.Appendhash[index].ToStringx2                          return Encoding.UTF8.GetByteschecksumBuilder.ToString                   public static bool ValidateDataIntegritystring data, string targetHashcode                      return GenerateSHA256data.EqualstargetHashcode                codepre  pI have ran my test multiple times, and every time it seems that more integers are generated within the hash than letters.

Let H be a hashfunction which outputs 2tbit strings. We denote by EEx,rgxhrmod n a commitment to x in [0,b], where r is randomly selected over [2sn1,2sn1]. This commitment, from [13], statistically reveals no information about x to Bob.p      pstrongProtocolstrong PK[CFT]x,r EEx,r wedge x in [2tlb,2tlb].p      ol   liAlice picks random omega in R[0,2tlb1] and eta in R[2tlsn1,2tlsn1], and then computes Wgomegaheta mod n.li   liThen, she computes CHW and cC mod 2t.li   liFinally, she computes D1 omega  xc and D2 eta rc in mathbbZ.

My add function appears to be working correctly from inside the function, but as soon as I check the hash tables contents from the contains function its obvious that somethings gone wrong.  p  precodevoid stringsetaddconst char s    copy s into new char array str char str[strlens] strcpystr, s find hash value of string int hValue  stringsethashfunctions  create new node to contain string node newNode  new node newNodegts  str  if strings position in hash table is empty, add directly and  set newNodes next to null. if not, set newNode next to  current first node in list and then add to hash table ifhashtable[hValue]  NULL      hashtable[hValue]  newNode     newNodegtnext  NULL  else      newNodegtnext  hashtable[hValue]     hashtable[hValue]  newNode  cout ltlt string added  ltlt hashtable[hValue]gts ltlt endl  return  codepre  pThis prints the expected string i.e. if I add e it prints e. But when I call this immediately after p  precodeint stringsetcontainsconst char s  find hash value of string int hValue  stringsethashfunctions  return inital value of hash table at that value cout ltlt hash table points to  ltlt hashtable[hValue]gts ltlt endl  codepre  pIt prints some junk. What have I done p  pSince this is for a class, the specifications have been provided and I have no opportunity to change the way the hash table is set up. Ill be adding exceptions etc later, just want to get the add function working. Thanksp  pEDIT Sorry, new to stack overflow and not sure about comment formatting Yes, I can use stdstring. The hash function is as followsp  precodeint stringsethashfunctionconst char s  int cValue 0 int stringSum  0  unsigned int i  0 fori  0 i lt strlens i      cValue  int s[i]     stringSum  stringSum  cValue  stringSum  stringSum  HASHTABLESIZE return stringSum  codepre

Positive 581 pIs there a hashing based data structure where I can search an item in O1 time on both key and value. p  pThis can be achieved by adding duplicate entry in the list for each key value par by reversing key and value, but it will take double the space.p  pThis kind of data structure might be useful in some scenarios like I want to store opening and closing parenthesis in a map and while parsing the string, I can just check in the map if the key is present without worrying about whether it is openingclosing map or closingopening map or without storing duplicate.p  pI hope I am clear enoughp

Positive 581 pI have a complex collection of data in the form of array of hashes.

So, I need to trim down the 64 bit hash value to a 48 bit value, yet it has to be in a safe manner in order to keep the information from all 64 bits and to minimize collision...br The basic idea is to have all bits in the 64bit hash value effect on the resulting 48bit hash value.br Is there any way to do thatbr BTW The hash function its a very good 64 bit hash function.

Positive 581 pI know that PHP 5.5s new hashing function doesnt have to use a userspecified salt, but would it increase security Ive been doing a bit of reading and from what I understand, the hashing function uses a random salt each time which it can retrieve from the hash value when it comes time to verify a hash. But would there be any advantage at all to generating your own salts and using them Any detrimentp

Negative 581 pSuppose I have codefileA.hcode which declares a class codeclassAcode with template function codeSomeFuncltTgtcode.

Negative 581 pMy system does some pretty heavy processing, and Ive been attacking the performance in order to give me the ability to run more test runs in shorter times.p  pI have quite a few cases where a UDF has to get called on say, 5 million rows and I pretty much thought there was no way around it.p  pWell, it turns out, there is a way to work around it and it gives huge performance improvements when UDFs are called over a set of distinct parameters somewhat smaller than the total set of rows.p  pConsider a UDF that takes a set of inputs and returns a result based on complex logic, but for the set of inputs over 5m rows, there are only 100,000 distinct inputs, say, and so it will only produce 100,000 distinct result tuples my particular cases vary from interest rates to complex code assignments, but they are all discrete  the fundamental point with this technique is that you can simply determine if the trick will work by running the codeSELECT DISTINCTcode.p  pI found that by doing something like thisp  precodeINSERT INTO PreCalcs SELECT param1        ,param2        ,dbo.udfresultparam1, param2 AS result FROM      SELECT DISTINCT param1, param2 FROM bigtable  codepre  pWhen PreCalcs is suitably indexed, the combination of that withp  precodeSELECT bigtable.param1     ,bigtable.param2     ,PreCalcs.result FROM bigtable INNER JOIN PreCalcs     ON PreCalcs.param1  bigtable.param1     AND PreCalcs.param2  bigtable.param2 codepre  pYou get a HUGE boost in performance.  Apparently, just because something is deterministic, it doesnt mean SQL Server is caching the past calls and reusing them, as one might think.p  pThe only thing you have to watch out for is where NULL are allowed, then you need to fix up your joins carefullyp  precodeSELECT bigtable.param1     ,bigtable.param2     ,PreCalcs.result FROM bigtable INNER JOIN PreCalcs     ON          PreCalcs.param1  bigtable.param1         OR COALESCEPreCalcs.param1, bigtable.param1 IS NULL          AND          PreCalcs.param2  bigtable.param2         OR COALESCEPreCalcs.param2, bigtable.param2 IS NULL      codepre  pHope this helps and any similar tricks with UDFs, or refactoring queries for performance are welcome.p  pI guess the question is, why is manual caching like this necessary  isnt that the point of the server knowing that the function is deterministic  And if it makes such a big difference, and if UDFs are so expensive, why doesnt the optimizer just do it in the execution planp

Negative 581 h2DTOh2  pIm building a Web application I would like to scale to many users. Also, I need to expose functionality to trusted third parties via Web Services.p  pIm using LLBLGen to generate the data access layer using SQL Server 2008. The goal is to build a business logic layer that shields the Web App from the details of DAL and, of course, to provide an extra level of validation beyond the DAL. Also, as far as I can tell right now, the Web Service will essentially be a thin wrapper over the BLL. p  pThe DAL, of course, has its own set of entity objects, for instance, CustomerEntity, ProductEntity, and so forth. However, I dont want the presentation layer to have access to these objects directly, as they contain DAL specific methods and the assembly is specific to the DAL and so on. So, the idea is to create Data Transfer Objects DTO. The idea is that these will be, essentially, plain old C.NET objects that have all the fields of, say, a CustomerEntity that are actually the database table Customer but none of the other stuff, except maybe some IsChangedIsDirty properties. So, there would be CustomerDTO, ProductDTO, etc. I assume these would inherit from a base DTO class. I believe I can generate these with some template for LLBLGen, but Im not sure about it yet.p  pSo, the idea is that the BLL will expose its functionality by accepting and returning these DTO objects. I think the Web Service will handle converting these objects to XML for the third parties using it, many may not be using .NET also, some things will be script callable from AJAX calls on the Web App, using JSON.p  pIm not sure the best way to design this and exactly how to go forward. Here are some issuesp  p1 How should this be exposed to the clients The presentation tier and to the Web Service codep  pI was thinking that there would be one public class that has these methods, every call would be be an atomic operationp  pInsertDTO, UpdateDTO, DeleteDTO, GetProducts, GetProductByCustomer, and so forth ...p  pThen the clients would just call these methods and pass in the appropriate arguments, typically a DTO.p  pIs this a good, workable approachp  p2 What to return from these methods Obviously, the GetFetch sort of methods will return DTO. But what about Inserts Part of the signature could bep  precodeInsertDTODTO dto codepre  pHowever, when inserting what should be returned I want to be notified of errors. However, I use autoincrementing primary keys for some tables However, a few tables have natural keys, particularly manytomany ones.p  pOne option I thought about was a Result classp  precodeclass Result      public Exception Error get set     public DTO AffectedObject get set  codepre  pSo, on an insert, the DTO would get its get ID like CustomerDTO.CustomerID property set and then put in this result object. The client will know if there is an error if Result.Error  null and then it would know the ID from the Result.AffectedObject property.p  pIs this a good approach One problem is that it seems like it is passing a lot of data back and forth that is redundant when its just the ID. I dont think adding a int NewID property would be clean because some inserts will not have a autoincrementing key like that. Another issue is that I dont think Web Services would handle this well I believe they would just return the base DTO for AffectedObject in the Result class, rather than the derived DTO. I suppose I could solve this by having a LOT of the different kinds of Result objects maybe derived from a base Result and inherit the Error property but that doesnt seem very clean.p  pAll right, I hope this isnt too wordy but I want to be clear.p
Negative 581 h3Im a C Newbh3  pI write lots of code in dynamic languages javascript, python, haskell, etc., but Im now learning C for graduate school and I have no idea what Im doing.p  h3The Problemh3  pOriginally I was building all my source in one directory using a makefile, which has worked rather well.  However, my project is growing and I would like to split the source into multiple directories unit tests, utils, core, etc..  For example, my directory tree might look like the followingp  precode.  src     foo.c     foo.h     main.c  test      testfoo.c codepre  pcodetesttestfoo.ccode uses both codesrcfoo.ccode and codesrcfoo.hcode.  Using makefiles, what is the beststandard way to build this  Preferably, there would be one rule for building the project and one for building the tests.p  h3Noteh3  pI know that there are other ways of doing this, including autoconf and other automatic solutions.  However, I would like to understand what is happening and be able to write the makefiles from scratch despite its possible impracticality.p  pAny guidance or tips would be appreciated.  Thanksp  h3[Edit]h3  pSo the three solutions given so far are as followsp  ul liPlace globally used header files in a parallel codeincludecode directoryli liuse the path in the codeincludecode satement as in codeinclude ..srcfoo.hcodeli liuse the codeIcode switch to inform the compiler of include locationsli ul  pSo far I like the codeIcode switch solution because it doesnt involve changing source code when directory structure changes.p

Negative 581 pIm currently writing an application that works with modules. The module part is all okay, but I am not entirely clear on what would be the best approach to display multiple modules on a same page. The way common MVC like systems could work is that an URL like site.comarticlefull18543howtoloseweight Im not implying anything about you   would launch article module and call its full method with params 18543 and howtoloseweight.p  pHowever, Im writing an application where I need to have multiple modules on the same page. Currently, I let the user to create, delete and modify pages. He has an interface a GUI to decide how a page should look like. For example, he can name page article and make it to look like a twocolumn layout where he wants to have a shoutbox on the rightside in a sidebar and articles on the main body the larger column. Now, how would I go for constructing the URL for something like that I would like to keep my current page system, but I find it a bit hard to come up with a solution. You see, if the URL would load the article module, then the shoutbox wouldnt be loaded. So, I guess the URL is a reference to a DB entry containing the info about which modules to load Thats my current thought. So, after the user has created a page article and put two modules into the article page which is a twocolumn layout, then the URL site.comarticlefull18543howtoloseweight would load the article page, which tells the application the needed modules to load.p  pThis leads me to two questionsproblems. First, would the rest of the URL full18543howtoloseweight go to the article module or to the shoutbox module How do I determine that The second problem is if this shoutbox module has a link to register an account rather than posting as an anonymous, where will this link take the user top  pIm basically trying to figure out a good way to build a relationship between different pages, modules and URLs.p  pCurrently I have Skins that handle the appearence and the possible positions where you can place modules. Pages that tell which modules are in which page and where they are positioned in a skin.p  pAnd now I need to determine the way I work with URLs.

Negative 581 pI have a date import project in which the clients send ANSIlatin1 encoded files iso88591.  However...  It seems that on a weekly basis we get a surprise file, one that is not of the correct format and the import basically dies horribly and needs manual intervention to recover and move on...  Most common bad file formats seem to be excel, compress file or an XMLHTML file... p  pSo in order to mitigate the human intervention, I would like to reasonably determine if we have a strong ANSI candidate file, before attempting to go through each line of the file looking for 1 of 64 bad characters and then making a guestimate on whether the whole line or file is bad on the  of bad characters foundp  pI was thinking of maybe making a UnicodeUTF check andor magic number check or evening trying to check for a few specific application types..  The files have no file extensions so any check would be by examining the content and any fast way to rule out the file as nonANSI would be perfect, since the import process needs to process 100500 records a second.p  pNOTE Over 100 different types of bad files have been sent to us, including images and PDFs. So there is a concern about whether you can easily and quickly rule out LTOS of different non ANSI types rather than specifically targeting just a few...p

Negative 581 pBasically I think this is a bug in Windows Server 2008, but I am not a COM ninja so it seems equally likely that Im just doing something dumb. The question is bug or programmer errorp  pWe use WinHttpRequest the ActiveX component of WinHttp to read http and https. The ProgID we are using to look up the component is codeWinHttp.WinHttpRequest.5.1code.p  pOur application worked fine on XP and Windows Server 2003. Under Windows Server 2008 we would get an error code0x800029C4A Error loading type libraryDLLcode loading the type library. Reregistering winhttp fixes the issue. The question is, whyp  pAfter numerous deadends, I found the following in the registry.p  pWindows 2008 Server SP2 as installedp  precodeNameHKEYLOCALMACHINESOFTWAREClassesTypeLib662901FC695148549EB2D9A2570F2B2E5.10win32SystemRootsystem32winhttp.dll TypeREGSZ DataSystemRootsystem32winhttp.dll codepre  pAfter calling coderegsvr32 SystemRootSystem32WinHttp.dllcode, this key changes valuep  precodeNameHKEYLOCALMACHINESOFTWAREClassesTypeLib662901FC695148549EB2D9A2570F2B2E5.10win32 TypeREGSZ DataCWindowssystem32winhttp.dll codepre  pMy understanding is that keys of type codeREGEXPANDSZcode expand system paths like codeSystemRootcode but codeREGSZcode do not. So either the type should be codeREGEXPANDSZcode, or the expanded path should be used. Reregistering WinHttp fixes the path and thus fixes WinHttpRequest. As far as I can tell, XP used codeCWindowsSystem32winhttp.dllcode and Server 2003 used a SxS install that works for me0p  pSo I think this is a bug, and I filed a bug with Microsoft or at least as much as I could do from the swamp that is connect.microsoft.com. But heres the part I dont get since Windows Server 2008 and Vista are very similar, it seems likely that this issue is present in Vista also. WinHttpRequest has got to be a commonly used object. The masses should be screaming, but after lots of googling I found a hrefhttpblogs.msdn.comvikasarchive20081001bugunabletoloadwinhttpdllintooutlook2007vbareferences.aspx relnofollowonly one thread where people encountered this problema.p  pReregistering winhttp fixes the issue, so thats what were doing. Im posting this because a I just cant believe that it is best practice to reregister this commonlyused component and b if it is a bug, maybe this will help somebody else.p  pRobp

Negative 581 pI had a client ask for advice building a simple WPF LOB application the other day. They basically want a CRUD application for a database, with main purpose being as a WPF training project.p  pI also showed them Linq To SQL and they were impressed.p  pI then explained its probably not a good idea to use that L2S entities directly from their BLL or UI code. They should consider something like a Repository pattern instead.p  pAt which point I could already feel the overengineering alarm bells going off in their heads and also in mine to some extent. Do they really need all that complexity for a simple CRUD application OK, its effectively functioning as a WPF training project for them but lets pretend it turns into a real app.p  ul liDo you ever think its acceptable to use L2S entities all through your applicationli liHow difficult is it from experience to refactor to use another persistence framework laterli ul  pThe way I see it, if the UI layer uses the L2S entities as a simple a POCO without touching any L2S specific methods then that should be really easy to refactor later on if need be.p  pThey do need a way to centralize the L2S queries, so some sort of way to manage that is needed, even if they do use L2S entities directly. So in a way we are already pushing toward some aspects of DALDAORepository.p  pThe main problem with Repo I can see is the pain of mapping between L2S entities and some domain model. And is it really worth it You get quite a lot for free on L2S entities which I think would be hard to use once you map to another model.p  pThoughtsp

Negative 581 pA long time ago, I had to test a program generating a postscript file image. One quick way to figure out if the program was producing the correct, expected output was to do an md5 of the result to compare against the md5 of a known good output I checked beforehand.p  pUnfortunately, Postscript contains the current time within the file. This time is, of course, different depending on when the test runs, therefore changing the md5 of the result even if the expected output is obtained. As a fix, I just stripped off the date with sed.p  pThis is a nice and simple scenario. We are not always so lucky. For example, now I am programming a writer program, which creates a big fat RDF file containing a bunch of anonymous nodes and uuids. It is basically impossible to check the functionality of the whole program with a simple md5, and the only way would be to read the file with a reader, and then validate the output through this reader. As you probably realize, this opens a new can of worms first, you have to write a reader which can be time consuming, second, you are assuming the reader is functionally correct and at the same time in sync with the writer. If both the reader and the writer are in sync, but on incorrect assumptions, the reader will say no problem, but the file format is actually wrong.p  pThis is a general issue when you have to perform functional testing of a file format, and the file format is not completely reproducible through the input you provide. How do you deal with this casep

Negative 581 pIm building a report in Reporting Services 2005 based on a SSAS 2005 cube.  The basic idea of the report is that they want to see sales for this fiscal year to date vs. last year sales year to date.  It sounds simple, but being that this is my first real report based on SSAS, Im having a hell of a time.p  pFirst, how would one calculate the current fiscal year, quarter, or month.  I have a Fiscal Date Hierarchy with all that information in it, but I cant figure out how to say Based on todays date, find the current fiscal year, quarter, and month.p  pMy second, but slightly smaller problem, is getting last years sales vs. this years sales.  I have seen MANY examples on how to do this, but they all assume that you select the date manually.  Since this is a report and will run pretty much on its own, I need a way to insert the current fiscal year, quarter, and month into the PERIODSTODATE or PARALLELPERIOD functions to get what I want.p  pSo, Im begging for your help on this one.  I have to have this report done by tomorrow monring and Im beginning to freak out a bit.  Thanks in advance.p

Negative 581 pI have a client connected to a server using twisted. The client has a thread which might potentially be doing things in the background. When the reactor is shutting down, I have top  precode1 check if the thread is doing things 2 stop it if it is codepre  pWhats an elegant way to do this The best I can do is some confused thing likep  precodedef cleanupself     isWorkingDF  defer.Deferred     doneDF  defer.Deferred      def checkIsWorking         res  self.stuff.isWorking blocking call         reactor.callFromThreadisWorkingDF.callback, res      def shutdownOrNotisWorking         if isWorking             shutdown necessary, shutdown is also a blocking call             def shutdown                 self.stuff.shutdown                 reactor.callFromThreaddoneDF, None             reactor.callInThreadshutdown                         else             doneDF.callbackNone no shutdown needed      isWorkingDF.addCallbackshutdownOrNot      reactor.callInThreadcheckIsWorking      return doneDF codepre  pFirst we check if its working at all. The result of that callback goes into coderescallbackcode which either shuts down or doesnt, and then fires the doneDF, which twisted waits for until closing.p  pPretty messed up eh Is there a better way p  pMaybe a related question is, is there a more elegant way to chain callbacks to each other I could see myself needing to do more cleanup code after this is done, so then Id have to make a different codedonecode deferred, and have the current codedoneDFcode fire a callback which does stuff then calls that codedonecode deferred..p

Negative 581 pSo I have been twiddling with a personal project to import my garmin gps data into a local database.  The data lives in a GPX xml file, whose schema is defined by an xsd file.p  pThe idea is for the client to upload their GPX file, and the SL client would validate it before sending it to the server.  But I ran into some issues here, first that it seems silverlight cannot validate xml against xsd.p  pSo first, is this true or have I just not figured out how to do the validation on the client side  I already wrote the code on the server side a regular class library but this code wont compile on the client side if I try to move it there.  An error about cant use new XmlSchemaSet because it is a private constructor.p  pSecondly, assuming that I do indeed have to do the validation on the server side, how with RIA do I return informative errors to the clientp

Negative 581 pI have problems with understanding what is the nature of the first node, or the so called head, in a linked list data structure. A linked list consists of nodes, and each node contains some data and a link to another node in the list. But is the very first node a node which contains data and a link to the second node Or is it contain only a link and no data to a node I thought that the very first node in a linked list has both data and a link to another node, but in one introductory book it is explained that the head is a node but a link that gets you to the first node. At the same time head is a variable of the type of the node. Why is it like this I am working in Java, if that matters. Thanks you. p

Negative 581 pWhile separating business logic and data access logic into two different assemblies, I want to abstract away the concept of identity so the business logic will deal with one consistent identity Type without having to understand its actual representation in the data source.  p  pIve been calling this a emcompound identityem abstraction for lack of a better term. p  pData sources in this project are swappable, various, and the business logic shouldnt care which data source is currently in use. The identity is the toughest part  because its implementation can change per kind of data source, whereas other fields like name, address, etc are consistently scalar values.p  pstrongWhat Im searching for is a good way to abstract the concept of identity, whether it be an existing library, a software pattern or just a solid good idea of some kind provided in an answer.strong p  pThe proposed compound identity value would have to be comparable and usable in the business logic e.g. bound to a combobox as the tracked value and passed back to the data source to specify records, entities andor documents to affect, so the data source must be able to parse back out the details of its own compound ids.p  pstrongData Source Examplesstrong  p  pThis serves to provide an idea of what I mean by various data sources having different identity implementations. p  ol lipA strongrelational data sourcestrong might express a piece of content with an integer identifier plus a language specific code.

We used the validation Design by contract framework a hrefhttpoval.sourceforge.net relnofollowOVala where one could script custom constraints using Groovy as annotations on methods and classes. Removing the annotations in favor of explicit pre and postconditions in plain Java was boring, but it got the job done. I suspect each time an OVal constraint was being checked a new anonymous class was being created and somehow the associated class data was causing a memory leak.p

A transaction is created for me for each method call to an annotated class. This makes it difficult to write code that can be reused across all db calls.p  pOne solution would be to put the db code within a loop It will retry the transaction a few times. This works but Id prefer not to sprinkle my code full of loops one for each db call.p  pIs their a way to make either one of the following frameworks retry a failed beginTransaction automatically Spring, JPA, Hibernate, c3p0, MySQL JDBC driverp  pFor reference, here is a piece of the logp  precodejava.net.SocketException MESSAGE Connection reset  STACKTRACE java.net.SocketException Connection reset         at java.net.SocketInputStream.readSocketInputStream.java168         at com.mysql.jdbc.util.ReadAheadInputStream.fillReadAheadInputStream.java113         at com.mysql.jdbc.util.ReadAheadInputStream.readFromUnderlyingStreamIfNecessaryReadAheadInputStream.java160         at com.mysql.jdbc.util.ReadAheadInputStream.readReadAheadInputStream.java188         at com.mysql.jdbc.MysqlIO.readFullyMysqlIO.java1910         at com.mysql.jdbc.MysqlIO.reuseAndReadPacketMysqlIO.java2304         at com.mysql.jdbc.MysqlIO.checkErrorPacketMysqlIO.java2803         at com.mysql.jdbc.MysqlIO.sendCommandMysqlIO.java1573         at com.mysql.jdbc.MysqlIO.sqlQueryDirectMysqlIO.java1665         at com.mysql.jdbc.Connection.execSQLConnection.java3170         at com.mysql.jdbc.Connection.setAutoCommitConnection.java5273         at com.mchange.v2.c3p0.impl.NewProxyConnection.setAutoCommitNewProxyConnection.java881         at org.hibernate.transaction.JDBCTransaction.beginJDBCTransaction.java91         at org.hibernate.impl.SessionImpl.beginTransactionSessionImpl.java1353         at org.hibernate.ejb.TransactionImpl.beginTransactionImpl.java38         at org.springframework.orm.jpa.DefaultJpaDialect.beginTransactionDefaultJpaDialect.java70         at org.springframework.orm.jpa.vendor.HibernateJpaDialect.beginTransactionHibernateJpaDialect.java52         at org.springframework.orm.jpa.JpaTransactionManager.doBeginJpaTransactionManager.java330         at org.springframework.transaction.support.AbstractPlatformTransactionManager.getTransactionAbstractPlatformTransactionManager.java374         at org.springframework.transaction.interceptor.TransactionAspectSupport.createTransactionIfNecessaryTransactionAspectSupport.java263         at org.springframework.transaction.interceptor.TransactionInterceptor.invokeTransactionInterceptor.java101         at org.springframework.aop.framework.ReflectiveMethodInvocation.proceedReflectiveMethodInvocation.java171         at org.springframework.aop.framework.JdkDynamicAopProxy.invokeJdkDynamicAopProxy.java204 codepre  pPS.

Negative 581 pI want to scan through a huge corpus of text and count word frequencies ngram frequencies actually for those who are familiar with NLPIR. I use a Java HashMap  for this. So what happens is I process the text line by line. For each line, I extract the words, and for each word, I update the corresponding frequency in the hashmap. p  pThe problem is that this process gets slower and slower. For example, it starts by processing around 100k lines  second  and the performance starts falling right away. After about 28 million lines , the performance has fallen to 16k lines  second  and of course keeps falling.p  pFirst thing that came to mind was that it was caused of too many entries in the hashmap, which caused every put and every get to be slower every time. So what I tried was to only keep the most say 100k frequent entries in the hashmap at anytime. This was done by using a second map that mapped frequencies to words as in here a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions7465369automaticallysortedbyvaluesmapinjavaAutomatically sorted by values map in Javaa p  pThis performed a lot faster in general. although it started at 56 k lines  sec, by the time it reached 28 mil lines, the performance had only dropped to 36.5k lines  sec. However, this also kept falling, at a much slower rate  but the fact remains, that it kept falling.p  pHave you got any possible explanation of why does this happen when the hashmaps size remains the same Do you think this has anything to do with the garbage collector Meaning, that the fact that I keep putting, and removing object tofrom hashmaps fragments up the memory or something Or could it be a hashing function problem Since Im using strings, the hashing function is Javas default hashing function for strings.p  pHere is the part of my code that performs the aforementioned taskp  pa hrefhttppastebin.comP8S6Sj86 relnofollowhttppastebin.comP8S6Sj86ap  pNOTE I am a Java newbie so any elaboration in your answers is more than welcomep
Negative 581 pWe have several after effects plugins that we have good evidence are leaking memory.

I enabled leak detection withp  precodedefine CRTDBGMAPALLOC include ltstdlib.hgt include ltcrtdbg.hgt codepre  pAnd I get a nice dump of leaks. However, I dont get file names and line numbers. My best guess is that this is because Im building a dll, which is consumed by the after effects exe, and the define needs to be made in the executable, not my plugin this doesnt entirely fit with my mental model of what this define and includes actually do, but its the best I can come up with.p  pSo the other option is setting breakpoints for specific memory allocation numbers. However, the leaking allocations arent a set of consistant allocation numbers, so Im having limitted success with that.p  pSo, any ideas here Either how to better use this tool, or other ways to investigate this Thanksp

Negative 581 pI am in doubt with using objects from multiple threads.p  pFirst of all it is no problem to protect the object against simultaneous access with codestdlockguardcode or others.p  pThe next step is to declare the objects with volatile.p  precodeclass A     public int val   volatile A a codepre  pBut doing this ends up in having a lot of new functions with type qualifiers codevolatilecode     ...     int GetVal volatile     void SetVal volatile     ...p  pOK, all this works fine.p  pBut how to access stl members, e.g. codestdvectorcode or codestdmap.codep  pIf I want to have a volatile codestdvectorltintgtcode I run in lots of errors while stl do not define any volatile method.p  pFrom this point I searched the net and found a lot of tricks.

Negative 581 pIm trying to setup a simulation program. The simulation runs for a number of steps, and the simulation class should call step of a bunch of different classes, one of them is the experiment class. p  pI cannot get this to work, because the experiment class needs the simulation class and the simulation class needs to know what an experiment class is, so they are cyclic dependent. Ive tried solving it by using a forward declaration, but then I cannot acces methods of the forward declared class. What is the point of forward declaring then Can anyone help me Thanksp  pmain.cppp  precodeint main      experiment experiment  codepre  pexperiment.cppp  precodeinclude experiment.h  experimentexperiment      simulation simulation     simulation.experiment  this     simulation.start   void experimentstep      Apply forces to simulation  codepre  pexperiment.hp  precodeinclude simulation.h  class experiment  public     void step  codepre  psimulation.cppp  precodeinclude simulation.h  void simulationrun      Run simulation for 1000 steps     forint i  0 i lt 1000 i              experimentgtstep Calculate forces.

Negative 581 pI received this project from a senior programmer, who has just left the company. This map had lots of issues out of which many are fixed.  Now there are 2 major issues left in there. 1. markers position is not fixed i.e. if you mouse drag codeenter code herecodeany marker you can  i need to make them fixed at their place. 2. i have problem with zoom fitBounds. i have called fitBounds function in  setupOfficeMarkers, which refreshes twice on every change in the map. So, it brings the same lats and langs every time. Because of which zooming any marker is just not possible. So far i am not able to locate the place where i can best suitably put this fitBounds call. p  pSorry for putting such a long code. but i wanted to place maximum thing to resolve these issues.p  pThanks alot for your help and support in advance.p  precodelthtmlgt  ltheadgt  ltmeta nameviewport contentinitialscale1.0, userscalableno gt  ltmeta httpequivcontenttype contenttexthtml charsetUTF8gt

How do I make a static legend showing all four categories with a color examplep  ol librown           Groundli lilight blue      Water level beneath threshold 1li listandard blue   Water level between thresholdsli lidark blue       Water level above threshold 2li ol  pThe only solution I can think of is making 3 neat little patches somewhere by the axis where it wont be noticed in the right blue colors and then making the legend point at them and not the water surface. But that would be a real crappy solution...p

Negative 581 pWe have a DX gridview being rendered in a specifically designed view. We pass a predefined ViewModel object whose values are filled from a Linq2Entities query. The problem is that in our callback function the L2E query is actually executed on the DB before any filtering, sorting and paging has been performed by the DevExpress grid. IE. simplified example, in the actual situation we select data from several tables but still in a single linq queryp  precodepublic ActionResult GridViewPartialstring myParameters       var modelData  from s in db.myTable                                       select new  modelName  s.Name       return PartialViewGridViewPartial, modelData  codepre  pIn this situation the query is actually executed before the data has been passed to the View. Therefore it actually selects way too much data from the DB while the gridview only displays the selected page. p  pHow would we have to modify the query so it only selects the data of the page the user has selected IE. skip 10 rows and take 10 in the L2E query when the user selects page 2, instead of selecting 100000 rows if there are that many in the table and afterwards applying the filteringsortingpaging, like in the described situationp

Negative 581 pDepending of some flag I want to use certain component in my mxml.p  pThere is not a default value. So its probably incorrect to put one in mxml and then with states remove it and add the other.p  pBoth also share the same interface, and I call methods in Actionscript using id. That means that if I put them in different states in mxml, the compiler will complain about same id used 2 times.p  pIs there any conditional statement or state management like if x use this component, else use other one preferably with mxml not actionscript  And in a way they are mutually exclusive can have same idp

Negative 581 pIve been trying to track down why it takes so long to debug our program when in debugging mode.

Unfortunately the property setter to accomplish this is also marked codeinternalcode DOH.li ul  pIn short, unless I find another way to initialize the MVC framework, my options now are to eitherp  ul liCOMPLETELY duplicate the source code for DefaultControllerFactory and its dependencies, so that I can bypass the original codeGetReferencedAssembliescode issue.  ughli liCOMPLETELY replace the MVC distributable with my own build of MVC, based on the MVC source code  with just a couple codeinternalcode modifiers removed. double ughli ul  pIncidentally, I know that the MvcContrib TestHelper has the appearance of accomplishing my goal, but I think it is merely using reflection to find the controller  rather than using the actual IControllerFactory to retrieve a controller type  instance.p  pA big reason why I want this test capability is that I have made a custom controller factory, based on DefaultControllerFactory, whose behavior I want to verify.p

Negative 581 pIve installed the msp430gcc compiler and associated tools to do some opensource msp430 development at home using Eclipse.

I have a simple empty main written that compiles and links just fine.p  pThe ELF parser lets me view the contents of the ELF binary just fine with the exception of one component when I try to view the contents of the startup code in crt0.S, it gives me a blank file.

This makes sense because of my MacPorts install of msp430gcc. codecrt0.Scode is archived into codeoptlocallibgccmsp4304.6.3libcrt0.a on my machine.codep  pWhat I want to be able to do is tell Eclipse to look elsewhere for the source files for the libraries that are automatically linked when I build with the msp430gcc toolchain.  This would presumably include everything in codeoptlocallibgccmsp4304.6.3code. I started by downloading the source for mspgcc20120406 the version in my MacPorts install and applying the gcc patchfile to an empty directory tree. This created the codegccconfigmsp430code directory, including the codecrt0.Scode and codecrt0ivtbl.Scode files.p  pWhat I have had no luck accomplishing is telling Eclipse to look in codeDevelopermspgcc20120406gcc4.6.3configmsp430code instead of the path thats in the alreadybuilt codelibcrt0.acode. I tried playing around with the codeProject PreferencesgtPaths and SymbolsgtSource Locationcode window, but didnt have much luck. I searched through this website and on Google and the closest thing I came up with was a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions6784543howtoattachsourcetothelibrariesoneclipsecdtthis questiona but it doesnt smell like the right answer.p  pI would like to avoid solutions that involve moving the library source into my project.

Negative 581 pFor a project, I have a complex master object that contains a number of subcomponents.

My current code has a method traversing the class and returning a list of codeMemberExpressioncodes. The caller then iterates over the member expressions and creates lambdas, which should then be called with an instance of the inspected class to return the value of the property. p  pHere is a sample of what it would look like without the method calls Runnable in LINQPadp  precodevoid Main      var t  new Test  Prop  Test       var property  t.GetType.GetPropertyProp      var baseType  Expression.ParametertypeofTest, baseType     var memberAccess  Expression.MakeMemberAccessbaseType, property     var lambda  Expression.LambdaltFuncltTest, stringgtgtmemberAccess, Expression.ParametertypeofTest, baseType     var func  lambda.Compile     var result  funct     result.Dump   class Test      public string Prop  get set   codepre  pThis does not work, throwing this exceptionp  blockquote   pInvalidOperationException variable baseType of type UserQueryTest referenced from scope , but it is not definedp blockquote  pHowever, if I change the creation of the lambda to thisp  precodevar lambda  Expression.LambdaltFuncltTest, stringgtgtmemberAccess, baseType codepre  pThat is, replace the codeExpression.Parametercode with the variable used earlier, then it works. This is not easily possible in the scenario where I want to use it, since I would have to return the original parameter along with the list I could return a tuple, of course, but I would prefer not to, if it is not necessary. p  pWhy does it work like this Inspecting the codeDebugViewcode of the lambda, they are exactly the same no matter what approach is usedp  precode.Lambda Lambda1ltSystem.Func2[UserQueryTest,System.String]gtUserQueryTest baseType      baseType.S  codepre
Negative 581 pIm not really used to making batch files, so Im probably doing something wrong, but Im really having trouble with echo offon.  That said, if you see any other error that I missed, feel free to point it outp  pHeres a simplified version of my codep  precodeecho off setlocal set args set dir.  getargs IF 2      set dir1     goto callbatch  set argsargs 1 shift goto getargs  callbatch for f in dir.txt do      echo processing f     BATCHHOMEbatch.bat args f     echo  codepre  pSo basically, I have a batch file in BATCHHOME that does something to a single txt file and I want to produce a batch file that will process all the txt files in a given directory.  The lone echo in the loop is to better illustrate the problem. p  pNow, heres where I have a problem.  The output of this looks like p  precodeprocessing footext1.txt some output from batch.bat ECHO is on.  Csomedirgt echo processing footext2.txt    Cthepathofbatch.bat the arguments here footext2.txt  ECHO is on.  Csomedirgt echo processing footext3.txt    Cthepathofbatch.bat the arguments here footext3.txt  ECHO is on.  etc codepre  pOk... I dont know why the batch file Im calling turns echo on, but I didnt make it, so Ill just turn it back off each time  I changed the last part top  precodecallbatch for f in dir.txt do      echo processing f     BATCHHOMEbatch.bat args f     echo off  echo echo on echo echo Finished codepre  pAgain, the two lone echo are there for debug So now the output looks like this p  precodeprocessing footext1.txt some output from batch.bat processing footext2.txt some output from batch.bat processing footext3.txt some output from batch.bat etc. ECHO is off. ECHO is on. Finished codepre  pThis would be almost perfect, but theres something a bit odd.  If echo is on, then why does it display Finished instead of echo Finished  The bigger but related problem however is that when the batch file is done, I dont get my path displayed any more.  In other words, instead of havingp  precodeCSomedirgt codepre  pI just getp  precode codepre  pI need to type echo on manually to get the path to show again.  Where did I go wrongp  pedit Just to clarify, I am aware that echo by itself prints the current status of echo.  That is what I intended.  In the first code, they are there to show that echo mysteriously turns on after I call the other batch file.  In the second one, it is there to show that echo is on at the end of the batch file, yet the behaviour is as if it wasnt.  THAT is my problem.p

Negative 581 pIn Stata I have this data of people who have worked together on a project. Each row is a project and there are columns person1 to person20, and if a name is in that column it means that person worked on that project in the row. A group can be 1 person, 2 people, ..., 20 people. I have a binary variable yes  1 for each possibility Group of 1 G1, G2, ..., G11. Then I used this code to make the groupings using the 4 person group as an examplep  precodeprojectgroup  person1    person2    person3    person4 if G4  1 This yields TomJoeMikeSally codepre  pI have three questions 1 Is there a more efficient way to make the groupings. For example, code that just looks across a project a row, counts how many people are there how many fields are not empty and then creates a unique group name that is each persons name separated by . I am fine with the code I created but my dataset will change in size and more efficient code is probably bestp  p2 How can I treat, from my example, JoeTomMikeSally or SallyJoeMikeTime as the same group. I would prefer that all of the groups, no matter the size, listed each person by alphabetical order. From my example, the list would be JoeMikeSallyTom no matter the actual permutation. p  p3 How do I make a group unique based on the first person if they are  a project leader they are the first name listed. So JoeTomMike and JoeMikeTom are the same Group but TomJoeMike and MikeTomJoe are not.p  pThanks for the help and suggestionsp

Negative 581 pSo, I developed a tiny library directly in IL to interface with C for the codesizeofcode opcode NOT C operator. It was pointed out to me that my IL wasnt valid even though it was. p  pIn the ECMA spec it says the codesizeofcode opcode can take generic type parameters where in the a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibrarysystem.reflection.emit.opcodes.sizeof28vvs.11029.aspx relnofollowReflection.Emit opcodea for it, it indicates that generic type parameters may not be used. It also says it can only be used for value types, where the ECMA spec says it can be used for anything but behaves differently with reference typesp  pWhy is there such a difference between the Reflection.Emit documentation and the ECMA spec for CIL concerning this opcodep
Negative 581 pAs the title implies Im trying to animate a MKPolygonView, specifically the color and the opacity.p  pRight now I have a gesture detect whether the user has touched the polygon, by iterating through the overlayViews and finding out if the touch point is within the polygon.p  pIn anycase, I get the MKPolygonView, I change the fillcolor and the color changes but it doesnt quite do it the way I intended seeing to how overlays draw in tiles, defined as mapRects, so when you color it in, rather than coloring in the whole polygon, it colors sections of it at a time, according to where the polygon was laid in regards to an invisible grid on the map.p  pHaving the color for the mkpolygonview come in a tile at a time is okay but as I said its unideal.p  pThe problem is further complicated due to the fact that MKPolygonView cannot be subclassed. Im a little out of ideas, and would appreciate some input from you guys.p  pIf you made it this far, thanks.p

Ive also noticed in Win 7 there are paths that exceed 260 characters, which throws a codePathTooLongExceptioncode.p  pAll of which means, in C at least, you cannot scan a C drive and get a real figure back for the size of the volume because you have to skip any directory or file that throws an exception.p  pI am looking for a way of getting a proper, true, accurate figure for bytes stored on disk for a given directory.

Negative 581 pIm writing a WCF service that receives large messages from different clients. Each of these messages consists of an object graph where many of the inner objects may be identical. My service stores data from these messages into memory.p  pIm trying to minimize the services memory consumption. So I would like to store a single object instead of several identical objects that are received from the network nested inside the object graph.p  pIm using DataContractSerializer so first thing that comes in mind is using the a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibraryms731073.aspx relnofollowObject Graph Preservationa option codepreserveObjectReferencescode, however there are some disadvantages to this approachp  ul liNo interoperability with other technologies if that was the only problem, I could live with that.li liSerialization and Deserialization process runs slower.li liDoes not help much when objects are identical between different messages, possibly from different clients. Only good for objects on the same object graph in the same message.li ul  pSo, next thing that comes to mind is using some kind of a cache. When I get a message, I could traverse the object graph, use the cache to find a single instance for all identical objects, and update my storage with this single instance. When the storage disposes of all references to that object, it could be removed from the cache and free the memory for that object.p  pI could use a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibrarysystem.runtime.caching.memorycache28vvs.10029.aspx relnofollowMemoryCachea but unfortunately my keys are not strings, and I dont want to convert them to strings only in order to store them in a cache. What did Microsoft think to themselves when they limited the ObjectCache to string keysp  pSo, before rewriting a Cache class with weak references and keys that can be compared with IEqualityComparer, I wanted to make sure Im not missing anything here...p  hr  h2My questions areh2  ul liIs there a better approach to handling and storing in memory duplicated objects in a WCF serviceli liIs there a good efficient, general, open cache implementation that I could use instead of re writing oneli ul

Negative 581 pI am fairly new in signal processing, and one of my projects is to implement a C filter class. I need the  higher order coefficients of typical filters such as Chebyshev types I and II, Butterworth, Elliptic, and unfortunately, most of the coefficient tables in the net only lists up to 10th order max.

Negative 581 pI guess this is a performance computing question. Im writing a program in C which produces a large amount of output, much more than can typically be stored in RAM in its entirety. I intend to simply write the output to codestdoutcode so it may just be going to the screen, or may be being redirected into a file. My problem is how to choose an optimal buffer size for the data that will be stored in RAMp  pThe output data itself isnt particularly important, so lets just say that its producing a massive list of random integers.p  pI intend to have 2 threads one which produces the data and writes it to a buffer, and the other which writes that buffer to codestdoutcode. This way, I can begin producing the next buffer of output whilst the previous buffer is still being written to codestdoutcode.p  pTo be clear, my question isnt about how to use functions like codemalloccode and codepthreadcreatecode etc. My question is purely about how to choose a number of bytes 512, 1024, 1048576 for the optimal buffer size, which will give the best performancep  pIdeally, Id like to find a way in which I could choose an optimal buffer size dynamically, so that my program could adjust to whatever hardware it was being run on at the time. I have tried searching for answers to this problem, and although I found a few threads about buffer size, I couldnt find anything particularly relevant to this problem. Therefore, I just wanted to post it as a question in the hope that I could get some different points of view, and come up with something better than I could on my own.p

Negative 581 pIm attempting to use JAXB with data that does not technically fit the XML standard in particular, the names of the elements are technically invalid as they begin with numeric characters.

Since the full ITEM is huge and has many levels of depth, using an automated tool like JAXB to create classes is a must. To do so, I prefixed the names of the elements with a character in this case, m so that XJC would accept it. I was hoping that at runtime, I could map the XML tags to my Java class in order to unmarshal the input into a Java object. In particular, something like thisp  precodeXmlAccessorTypeXmlAccessType.FIELD XmlTypename  , propOrder       m01,     m08,     m10,     ...  XmlRootElementname  ITEM public class ITEM      XmlElementname  01     protected String m01     XmlElementname  08     protected String m08     XmlElementname  10     protected M10 m10     ...  codepre  pM10 would look likep  precodeXmlAccessorTypeXmlAccessType.FIELD     XmlTypename  , propOrder           m10a,         m10b,         ...  public static class M10      XmlElementname  10A     protected String m10a     XmlElementname  10B     protected String m10b     ...  codepre  pI was hoping that JAXB would be able to match the XmlElement tag to the tag in the input, but unfortunately this didnt work out for me because JAXB wont have any of this business with improper tags. If anybody is interested, the particular exception isp  precodeorg.xml.sax.SAXParseException The content of elements must consist of wellformed character data or markup codepre  pAnyone have any advice on how to get around this problem I feel like I could potentially run a regex swap on the input XML before JAXB parses it and thus bypassing this issue completely, but modifying the input in such a way is rather undesirable.p

Negative 581 pI have a Drupal site that I upgraded from Drupal 5 to Drupal 6.  The users profile pictures no longer display because they were contained under sitesdefaultfiles, and there is now no files folder under sitesdefault.p  pI wanted to make sure the imagecache module still worked, but it didnt  when I tried to upload a picture Durpal told me it could not move file.  So I made a files directory under sitesdefault to fix it.  However, not only did this not work, it caused the CSS of the theme to not render, making my site a mess of plain old html.p  pAfter experimenting around, I found that nothing bad happens when I put a folder named files under any other directory including sitesall, and nothing bad happens when you put a differently named folder under sitesdefault, but if I put a folder named files under sitesdefault, it causes the CSS to not render.p  pSo my question is, what is causing this and how can I fix it  How can I have the directory sitesdefaultfiles without causing my theme to not displayp

But in case when I want to calculate trapzoids for one of the integration interval in parallel along with other integrals, I dont have any idea how to approach this programatically.p

Inconsistent data is OK at this point.p  pHowever, the code actually reads with READ COMMITTED, and we cant figure out why.p  pHeres what we didp  ol liOpen the connectionli liExecute on this connection SET TRANSACTION ISOLATION LEVEL READ UNCOMMITTEDli liHit a breakpointli liExecute the SQLli ol  pOn the breakpoint, we issue this command to the databasep  precodeselect s.sessionid, s.transactionisolationlevel, st.text from sys.dmexecsessions s inner join sys.sysprocesses sp on sp.spid  s.sessionid  CROSS APPLY sys.dmexecsqltextsp.sqlhandle st codepre  pThis SQL reports 4 pooled connections right now, one of which is our connection that we can step beyond the breakpoint to execute our SQL with, that has this statep  precode53  2   SET TRANSACTION ISOLATION LEVEL READ UNCOMMITTED codepre  pie. session 53 has isolation level 2 READ COMMITTED, and the last SQL that was executed on this session was that SET TRANSACTION ... command.p  pHow can this bep  pWe verified with SQL Profiler that this connection did not live before our .NET code opened it, so it was not reused from the connection pool.p  pYet, with a fresh connection, and the only and first SQL executed on it explicitly told it to use READ UNCOMMITTED, how can the connection still be READ COMMITTEDp  pWhat should we look at herep  pThe connection string with bits redacted is like thisp  precodeSERVERhostnameDATABASEdbnameIntegrated SecurityfalseUSER IDsaPASSWORDApplication NameappnameType System VersionSQL Server 2000Workstation IDhostname codepre  pThe connections are normal codeSqlConnectioncode connections, opened in the normal way.p  pUnfortunately were unable to reproduce the problem if we write normal code opening a SqlConnection, so there has to be something with the application state, but since SqlProfiler and Sql Server both tells us that yes, the SQL was executed, but no, I dont care.p  pWhat can impact thisp  pThe exact same code also opens other connections, that is, the code is executed many times and opens many connections, so more than one connection ends up in the pool, yet only the very first connection ends up having this problem.p  pThis is SQL Server 2008 R2 and we have also reproduced this problem on 2012.p  pstrongEditstrongp  pOK, some more information.p  pFirst, we are enabling pooling, or rather, were not explicitly disabling it, nor are we twiddling the connection string to make N pools.p  pHowever, this connection is the first being opened with this particular connection string, thus it is not retrieved from the pool. Also see my note below about it being permanently sick.p  pThis connection is being set up like thisp  precodevar conn  new SqlConnection... conn.StateChance  connectionStateChange  private void connectionStateChangeObject sender, StateChangeEventArgs e      if e.CurrentState  ConnectionState.Open              using IDbCommand cmd  SqlConnectionsender.CreateCommand                      cmd.CommandText  SET TRANSACTION ISOLATION LEVEL READ UNCOMMITTED             cmd.ExecuteNonQuery          codepre  pWere not executing any other SQL before this.p  pNote that this code is used emmanyem times during the lifetime of the application, it is only the very first connection it opens that ends up being wrong.p  pThis connection also becomes permanently sick. Since every time we open the connection even though we might get it out of the connection pool, the above state change event executes, attempting to set the isolation level again. This also fails, but just for this single connection.p  pstrike Additionally weve found one thing that impacts this since I posted this question.p  pBy changing the connection string, that I posted abovep  precode...Type System VersionSQL Server 2000... codepre  pto thisp  precode...Type System VersionSQL Server 2008MultipleActiveResultSetstrue... codepre  pthen this problem goes away, at the breakpoint listed earlier, the connection now has READ UNCOMMITTED state.strikep  pThis was a red herring, the connection was no longer being reported in our overview until we had actually executed code there.p  pWere continuing our debugging.p

Negative 581 pI have a parent table codeCASEScode and child table codeUPDATEScode. A daily routine logs each row from codeCASEScode to the codeUPDATEScode table.

To enable reporting of specific codeUPDATEScode as subcomponents of codeCASEScode, I need a query that returns data as a flat set of results. In other words, I need to present something like codesq2CaseStatuscode to represent the secondmostrecent codeUPDATES.CaseStatuscode data for any given codeCASEcode or set of codeCASEScode. ie, codeCaseIdcode isare passed to report code, report code runs my stored procs, my SPs query and return result sets, report code keys on result set columns to find data.p  pI only need to present 12 most recent codeSeqNocode values 1  12 from the codeUPDATEScode table. But Im struggling with how to query and return this data within my main reporting query.p  pstrongQUESTIONstrong How to query and return data from codeUPDATEScode so that codeSeqNocode is presented, and available as a prefix for any reporting fieldp  pApologies in advance if my linear thinking is way of course here...p  pWithin my reporting query, there is a codeSELECTcode statement that grabs all data from codeCASEScode and select data from other linkedtables. Within this codeSELECTcode, could I use a looping technique to call a special functionp  pThis special function would take a counter variable from 1 to 12, use the variable to query my groupedsequenced codeTEMPcode table by codeSeqNocode, and also use the variable to present data back under coded columns. Thus, Id end up with 12 child tables linked back to my codeCASEcode records, like p  precodeSeqNo  UpdateID  sq1UpdateDate   CaseID  sq1CaseStatus  sq1[other fields]  1      9876      30Jun2013      345     [free text...] 1      9875      30Jun2013      789     [free text...]  SeqNo  UpdateID  sq2UpdateDate   CaseID  sq2CaseStatus  sq2[other fields]  2      9765      29Jun2013      345     [free text...] 2      9764      29Jun2013      789     [free text...]  and so on... codepre  pI think this could work. But is it possible to loop in this way within a codeSELECTcode statementp  pemNOTEem  In reality, both the codeCASEScode and codeUPDATEScode tables are quite wide, so I abandoned any option of widening my single codeTEMPcode table ie, to present all 112 codeSeqNocode sets of data for each codeCaseIdcode. Also, I realize that a change to the report interface code could help solve the issue  but Im trying to avoid that costly option.p  pstrongUPDATE  Workaroundstrong Well, Ive had to resort to the single wide codeTEMPcode table solution that I originally abandoned. I used a recursive script to help generate my long list of required codeMAXcode statements  these produce the prefixed column names. I then combined these with an codeINNER JOINcode performs the sequencing in a tablevalued function. Something like...p  precodeSELECT up.CaseId AS CaseId,        MAXCASE sq.SeqNo WHEN 1 THEN up.UpdateDate ELSE  END AS sq1UpdateDate,        MAXCASE sq.SeqNo WHEN 2 THEN up.UpdateDate ELSE  END AS sq2UpdateDate,        ...        ...ltup to sq12 for all fieldsgt...        ... FROM   UPDATES up INNER JOIN     SELECT UpdateId,          RowNumber OVER PARTITION BY CaseId ORDER BY UpdateDate Desc AS SeqNo   FROM   UPDATES  sq ON sq.UpdateId  up.UpdateId GROUP BY up.CaseId codepre
Negative 581 pIn backpropagation training, during gradient descent down the error surface, network with large amount of neurons in hidden layer can get stuck in local minimum. I have read that reinitializing weights to random numbers in all cases will eventually avoid this problem. This means that there always IS a set of correct initial weight values. Is this safe to assumep  pI need to find or make an algorithm that finds them. p  pI have tried googling the algorithm, tried devising it myself but to no avail. Can anyone propose a solution Perhaps a name of algorithm that I can search forp  pNote this is a regular feedforward 3layer burrito p  pNote I know attempts have been made to use GAs for that purpose, but that requires retraining the network on each iteration which is time costly when it gets large enough.p  pThanks in advance.p

Negative 581 pI am working on an application for navigation on android. That basically means that quality of returned gps coordinate is crucial for me. The application is meant to be mostly used on Samsung Galaxy S3, with minimum SDK version 15. I have thought of using Kalman filter to improve my location data, however I am not quite sure if this can bring me some progress. I have heard that gps data on android devices is already preprocessed with Kalman by I am not quite sure if this is true. So if somebody knows it would be very important for me to know if return coordinate from location sensor is already preprocessed with Kalman and also if the answer is yes, about the state description used in Kalman filter, that is which other sensors are used to describe state of the system.p  pThank you in advance for your answer.p

I first tried using codeangularFirenew Firebaseurlcode, hoping I could bind to the services scope, but Angular complains that it cannot codewatchcode it.p  pSo I tried angularFireCollection instead like thisp  precodeapp.factorymyService, function myServiceangularFireCollection      var url  httpsmyfirebase.firebaseio.com     return          getAll functionpath              var ref  angularFireCollectionnew Firebaseurl    path             console.logref             return ref         ,         ...       codepre  pHowever, the angularFireCollection is an Object containing a load of methods etc. if I bind it to a controller scope I just get garbage. It also complains that it cant call the Firebase functions before I try to use them e.g. codeError Firebase.push failed second argument must be a valid function.code... anyone got any ideas where Im going wrongp  pstrongSee this a hrefhttpplnkr.coedit3Hplw7PLUNKERastrongp

This seems like bad practice because a change in the class hierarchy mandates a change in other places.  Is there anyway to minimize the impact of adding a type to my Android app with regard to the XML the user can provide and the Schema that validates itp

Negative 581 pI have a data updater thread that uses callbacks to return either result or an exception to a manager. I use semaphore to synchronize manager start and getting the results of a background threads work either result or a an exception. Manager is launched only by other threads by calling coderunUpdatecode that uses codesynchronizer.tryAcquirecode. Other threads can try to get result from a manager at any time. So when that happens I check if background thread finished its work by checking semaphore state. So to return a result I clone it by a constructor and than I release semaphore. But in a case of exception I cannot do this. I must either create a new Exception thus losing its actual class and stack trace or release semaphore before throwing an exception and risk getting incorrect results codegetReturnedExceptioncode can already return null or other exception.p  precodeprivate final Semaphore synchronizer  new Semaphore1, true  public ListltMapltString, Objectgtgt getResult throws Exception      if synchronizer.tryAcquire1, TimeUnit.MILLISECONDS          if getReturnedException  null              ListltMapltString, Objectgtgt tempResult  new ArrayListltgtresult             synchronizer.release             return tempResult          else              Exception clonedEx  cloneExceptiongetReturnedException some way to clone an exception             throw clonedEx               else          throw new ExceptionBackground thread is still working        public void processExceptionException ex, Thread thread      setReturnedExceptionex     synchronizer.release  codepre  pSo is there a way to implement codecloneExceptioncode functionp

Negative 581 pI always used to think that codeSPcode was relative to codeBPcode, Meaning that pushingand popping stuff on the stack would use the address codeBPcode  codeSPcode, with codeBPcode being the start of the stack, and codeSPcode being the current item on the top of the stack. However, after looking at the CDECL calling convention, that would not make sense, as codeSPcode is assigned to the value of codeBPcode. So, if I change codeBPcode, does that even effect codeSPcode Is codeBPcode even used for codepushcodecodepopcode instructions Or does codepushcodecodepopcode just work with codeSPcode Is codeBPcode even neededp

Negative 581 pI am faced with with the challenge of needing to maintain two versions of the same product for an unknown period of time. I think I have come up with a workable solution, but I wanted to bounce it off the community for a sanity check.  Currently when a new feature is requested, a branch is cut from trunk, the development is completed in that branch, and that branch is merged back to the trunk.  This has been the typical strategy for most places I have worked.  p  pRecently a new branch was cut for a major feature overhaul which will result in changes not compatible with trunk.  All of our users will emeventuallyem be forced onto this new version but, for a period of time, both versions will exist in the wild.  Before I get to in depth, here is a diagram of what my current plan is for branchingp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comKDtGh.png altbranching strategyp  pVersionCurrent is what is currently released from.  As VersionNew is developed, bug fixes will continue to be shipped for VersionCurrent that will in all likelihood need to be merged into VersionNew  Obviously any new feature  bug fix for VersionNew will only need to be merged down into VersionNew.  Once VersionCurrent is no longer in the field, VersionNew will become the singular trunk. While I think this is workable, I think it can quickly balloon into a management nightmare.  My question is is there a better branching strategy that could be followed in my given case, or is this pretty much itp

Negative 581 pI am creating a C Windows registration form, this means that a user have to enter his username, password and other particulars in order to sign up for an account.p  pSo I used the Validating event with two ErrorProviders for each textbox to validate the textboxes one for error, one for ok, to ensure that the username is at least 5 characters long, password at least consisting of 1 upper case, 1 lower case, etc, email format is correct... you get the idea.p  pThe following is one of the validating code for my username textboxp  precodeprivate void usrTxtBoxValidatingobject sender, CancelEventArgs e      if string.IsNullOrEmptyusrTxtBox.Text              usrOk.Clear         usrError.SetErrorusrTxtBox, field required         count          else if Regex.IsMatchusrTxtBox.Text, ltREGEX PATTERNgt              usrOk.Clear         usrError.SetErrorusrTxtBox, ltERROR MESSAGEgt         count          else              usrError.Clear         usrOk.SetErrorusrTxtBox, good to go         count  0       codepre  pThat is repeated for every single textbox i have username, password, name, email and contact number, each with a different regex pattern.p  pSo as you all may know, the Validating event only validates when the textbox has been Focused and then loses focus. Therefore, when i click Register by just correctly entering the required values for the first textbox, count would be equal to 0 and therefore, there would be no error. Code for register button click belowp  precodeprivate void rgstrClickobject sender, EventArgs e      if ValidateChildren              if count  0                      MessageBox.Showcheck again                  else if count  0                      MessageBox.Showgd to go                codepre  pI tried using ValidateChildren to force validation but it doesnt work.

Negative 581 pI just created a proofofconcept setup for Windows Azure Packs, having a Front End Server, a Publish Server and a Web Worker. There is a simple plan which allows full control over the web sites cloud. In the plans details the subscription storage space is set to unlimited.p  pTo proof that the web site and the deployment is working, I created an external git repository where I put a static file and connected the web site with this repository. The static file is served as expected. Then I created an empty MVC 4 project with only one controller and a simple view. I pushed it, synced and the deployment worked as well.p  pNow the problem comes up I pushed my original web site which consists of an MVC 3 project and 500 MB of static resources PDF, Images, .... I synced again in the web site administration portal and the deployment starts. However, it breaks because there is insufficient disk space. I checked the web worker VM and there is more than 70 GB of space.p  pI checked the folder quotas on the web worker using Server Managers File Server Resource Manager and I see a 200 MB quota on CinetpubtempDWASFilesSites and for every web site in the form of CinetpubtempDWASFilesSitesWEBSITENAME.p  pWhy is there a 200 MB quota, when the storage is unlimitedp  pI do understand that such an amount of static resource files shouldnt be part of the web site, but instead should be put on a blob storage space. While this is true for Windows Azure, I dont see a storage feature for Windows Azure Web Packs. What are my possibilitesp

Negative 581 pI have been trying to come up with a solution for having a QtQuick 2.0 scene together with a Direct3D scene for quite a while, but wasnt very successful. My goal is to have a Direct3D engine running at reasonable speed 60 FPS together with QML UI on top. Both things run just fine at 150200 FPS on their own. But when forced to cooperate together within one window, everything just goes bananas. I have investigated several approaches, but none of them seems to be sufficient enoughp  pstrongSolution A Rendering Direct3D scene into a texture, visualizing with QImage amp QQuickPaintedItemstrongp  ul lithis solution works quite well and it seems to be the preferred one according to other people on the web. However it is TERRIBLY slow. I wasnt able to have more than 1820 FPS in full HD. The bottleneck was clearly in the texture transfer chain from GPU D3D to CPU QImage and back to GPU QML renderer each frame. Especially the CPUGPU processing on the QML side was way too slowli ul  pstrongSolution B Rendering QtQuick scene into a FBO, then using Direct3D texturestrongp  ul lithis is basically the previous solution other way round. The speed is a little bit better when the UI does not require an update. Once it starts animating, everything drops down to 1820 FPS again. QOpenGLFramebufferObjecttoImage obviously takes its time. Implementing textureFBO double buffering on both sides to reduce stalls does not really help.li ul  pstrongSolution C QQuickView with enabled transparency on top of QWidget with Direct3D scenestrongp  ul liwas not lucky with this approach either. It seems like the transparency works only when QQuickView is in its own window. Once I put it on top of my D3D QWidget within the same window, it immediately stopped working and became fully opaque. Someone was trying to do something similar there as well a hrefhttpqtproject.orgforumsviewthread5484httpqtproject.orgforumsviewthread5484a, but I had no luck with that solution at all. Maybe keeping two completely separated windows main D3D window  frameless transparent QML window on top of each other all time would do the trick, but that just sounds silly.li ul  pstrongSolution X Modify ANGLE library and try to extract amp share D3D device context with my Direct3D rendererstrongp  ul lihavent tried this yet, avoiding any library modifications as long as possible. Would that even be a sensible optionli ul  pMy obvious questions here are Am I doing something wrong What is the preferred solution A, B, C, X or maybe something totally different Can someone point me to the right directionp  pstrongTLDRstrong emWhat is the fastest way to render QML scene on top of Direct3D sceneemp

It implements codeIQueryableUserStoreltEmployee, intgtcode, codeIUserStoreltEmployee, intgtcode, codeIUserPasswordStoreltEmployee, intgtcode, and codeIUserRoleStoreltEmployee, intgtcode.p  pWhen Im debugging the codeFindByIdAsyncint employeeIdcode method I see that it fires twice for some reason. The first time it fires I see the correct codeemployeeIdcode passed into it. The second time it fires the codeemployeeIdcode is set to 0. This is where it screws up, I think because it doesnt subsequently call the codeIsInRoleAsyncEmployee employee, string roleNamecode method.p  pWhen I refresh the page after it throws an exception that the emUserId is not foundem, the codeFindByIdAsync...code method is again called twice, but this time both times the codeemployeeIdcode is correct, and it then proceeds to call the codeIsInRoleAsync...code method.p  pHeres the code for both methodsp  precodepublic TaskltEmployeegt FindByIdAsync     int employeeId      this.ThrowIfDisposed      return this.Repository.FindSingleOrDefaultAsyncltEmployee, intgtemployeeId   public Taskltboolgt IsInRoleAsync     Employee employee,     string roleName      this.ThrowIfDisposed      if employee  null          throw new ArgumentNullExceptionemployee           if String.IsNullOrEmptyroleName          throw new ArgumentNullExceptionroleName           return Task.FromResultltboolgtemployee.Roles.Any         r gt             r.Name  roleName  codepre

Negative 581 pI have a very strange git error here that has me totally at a loss. Its not a major blocker, but its extremely irritating to work around all the time.p  pI have a working copy of a repository and, in said working copy, every time I switch from one branch to another Git tells me, after the switch has completed, that I have local modifications. A few more detailsp  ol liThis is on Windowsli liGit status shows the files as changed every line as changed, see attached screenshot for an exampleli liBeyond compare shows no differences file encoding and line endings are the same, both files exact same number of bytes.li liThe weird thing I cant reset the changes, whatever they are. Even deleting the file and then resetting the deletion results in a new file that is supposedly changed.li ol  pWhat could be going on here I thought that it might be something to do with file attributes, but I have no idea how to check this.p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comyzqLp.png altScreenshot of phantom git changesp  hr  pUpdate VonC was correct that it was line endings that were the issue. More specifically if you have codecore.autocrlfcode set to true but any files in the repository that were previously committed with Windows line endings then you will see this issue. The reason its impossible to reset the change is the fact that emchecking out the file modifies item, since Git works out that your working copy of the file is different to how it would look if you were to commit it now. Confusing, I know.p  pAnyway, I was able to fix the issue by making one huge commit that set all the line endings in the repository to Unix, which luckily turned out not to be as huge a pain as you might think. I followed the instructions in this post a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions1510798tryingtofixlineendingswithgitfilterbranchbuthavingnoluck15112731511273Trying to fix lineendings with git filterbranch, but having no lucka, specifically the answer by Russ Egan, which worked best for me.p

This is the functions.php file for the login page. Obviously it is not fully converted to PDO so dont criticize that, but basically in the login.php file I have it access this method, and pass the databasewhich is required in, the username, and the password from the form. I setup a basic query to find all users with the username input of the form. Then i prepare, and execute the query. I then need a row count, so I setup a rowcount variable running the rowCount method on the query, but the code does not move past there.

Negative 581 pI am currently working on a j2ee web application. The application features a way for users to reset their passwords if they forget them. p  pI have a database table with 3 columns username, key, and timestamp.  When the user requests a password change, I add an entry in that table with their username and a random key making sure that their are no duplicate keys in the table, also that a user can only appear once in the table. I also add the current time. I then send them an email with a link to the application that contains their key, something likep  precodemysite.comappresetkeyabcxyz123 codepre  pThe servlet that handles this request looks at the key in the url to find the matching entry in the reset table to determine which user the key belongs to. If the key doesnt match an entry, I show an error page, if it does, I show the password reset screen. Once the user changes their password, I manually delete the entry from that reset table.p  pI am trying to implement the equivalent of a time to live for the password reset links, so that I dont have entries loitering in the table unnecessarily, and I thought of 2 options, the first of which I have implementedp  p1 Create an EJB Timer that fires every minute that will delete entries in the reset table where the timestamp is older than 30 minutes. This is a manual process in that I am using hibernate as my jpa implementation, so I retrieve all the entries from the table, examine their timestamps, and delete the old ones.p  p2 Create a database job that deletes rows over a certain agep  pMy question is, does anyone see any drawbacks to the first approach, and second, is the 2nd option even possible with mysql I figure that if I can use the 2nd approach, I can get rid of the timer, and let the database handle the time to live aspect of the password reset links, and that may be more efficient.p  pI havent been doing j2ee development for that long, but based on the knowledge that I have, these seemed like 2 logical approaches. I welcome any input.p

At the moment we convert to BMP via an external program, but it is really slow.p  pThanksp

Negative 581 pI seem to be experiencing problems with the iOS8 coordinate system.  I am trying to figure out if this is the way it is supposed to be or a bug. Seems like a bug to me.  But when I access the frame property of an element I get different coordinates if I run it as iOS8 vs iOS 7.  It seems like the iOS8 doubles the numbers or is not taking  into account that I am running it on a retina screen.

I need the operations to be done in the following sequence Initialise Interpreter  API sends command  Interpreter does said command  Wait for new command.p  pHeres the main function of the interpreterp  precodeint mainint argc, char argv[]    extern FILE yyin  char semRead  canRead char semSend  canSend  semt canRead semt canSend  this part is just so that my code will be coming through a pipe  created by me, instead of stdin ifargc  1     yyin  stdin else ifargc  2      suppress  1      ifstrcmpargv[1], s  0          char source  tmpcolliPipe         mkfifosource, 0666          yyin  fopensource, w          else         printfError unknown option sn, argv[1]         return 1       else ifargc gt 2     printfError too many parametersn     return 2  if YYDEBUG  1     extern int yydebug     yydebug  1 endif  initTables Initializing symbol tables    ifsuppress     printfColli 0.0.1  2014     printfgtgt    canRead  semopensemRead, OCREAT, 0644, 0 canSend  semopensemSend, OCREAT, 0644, 0  sempostcanSend  yyparse  return 0      codepre  pThing is when I create my thread, I have no guarantee that my parser will be ready to receive my input. codesempostcanSendcode is used to signal that the parser should be ready to get said input, but its not working because the OS can decide to swap processes after the post, but before codeyyparsecode.p  pQuestion is Can I make sure that the parser is ready to parse BEFORE posting to the semaphorep  pThanks in advancep

Negative 581 pI have been developing one Windows Store app for Win 8.1. Is there a way to access the users OneDrive which is already synced on the hard drive I need to access it as a StorageFolder. Similarly to KnownFolders and all the libraries. The reason behind that is that I am doing something like a gallery app that displays thumbnails of videos and pictures. When the users decides the app shows the media in full size and if it is a video, it is played. The app counts on the fact that OneDrive automatically syncs all the data, so it does need to be retrieved via the Live SDK API. If I use REST, it will be just too slow. Do you know if there is a way to achieve the mentioned approach effectively or maybe some alternativep  pI have been researching extensively, but with no avail. p  pThank youp  pAll the best, Roskop

Negative 581 pIm interfacing with a C API that has a few functions of the following formp  precodeint getinfo stuff , sizet insize, void value, sizet outsize codepre  pThis is a wellknown C idiom to return a bunch of data of different types from a single function the codeinsizecode parameter contains the size of the buffer passed into codevaluecode, and the actual number of bytes written out is written through the codeoutsizecode pointer, the caller can then read back its data in the codevaluecode buffer.p  pIm trying to call these kinds of functions from C nicely i.e. without making an overload for each different type and having to call them individually, which is buttugly and introduces a lot of duplicate code. So I naturally tried something like thisp  precode[DllImportDllName, EntryPoint  getinfo] int GetInfoltTgt stuff , UIntPtr inSize, out T value, out UIntPtr outSize codepre  pTo my amazement, this compiled and worked perfectly in Mono. Unfortunately, my hopes were quickly slashed by VS not wanting to compile it, and, indeed, generic methods are forbidden as DllImport targets. But this is basically what I am looking for. I tried a few thingsp  ul lipdynamically generating an appropriate PInvoke target based on a generic type using reflection absolutely atrocious, and very errorprone also loses all of the benefits offered by automatic marshalingpli liphaving one overload by type codeGetInfoIntcode, codeGetInfoStrcode, .. quickly gets out of controlpli liphaving a generic method taking a pointer using codeGCHandle.Alloccode and passing that into a basic codeGetInfocode which takes  an codeIntPtrcode works great, but needs special handling for enums because they regrettably arent blittable yes, I know I could simply codeGetInfolt[underlying enum type]gtcode and cast to the enum, but that kind of defeats the purpose because you cant invoke a generic method with a runtimedetermined type without reflection and strings also need special codepli ul  pSo I eventually thought that maybe having exactly three overloads, being codeGetInfoBlittableltTgtcode, codeGetInfoEnumltTgtcode, and codeGetInfoStrcode would be the best compromise between code duplication and reflection voodoo. But, is there a better way Is there a nicer way to get as close as possible to the first codeGetInfoltTgtcode snippet Ideally without needing to switch over types. Thanks for your helpp  hr  pFWIW, in total I would need to make this work with codeintcode, codelongcode, codeuintcode, codeulongcode, codestringcode, codestring[]code, codeUIntPtrcode, codeUIntPtr[]code, enum types, blittable structs, and possibly codestring[][]code.p

Negative 581 pWe have software written in Python, which uses JPype to call Java, which performs various resource heavy calculations  report building. We originally assigned 800mb of heap space when starting the JVM. The java side is fully multithreaded and will work with whatever resources are available to it.p  precodejvmArgs  [Djava.class.path  classpath, Xmx800M] jpype.startJVMujavajre8binclientjvm.dll, jvmArgs codepre  pThis worked well until we tested on Windows XP for our legacy clients. The new machines are Win 7 64bit with 4GB of RAM, whereas the old ones are Win XP 32bit with only 2 GB of ram.p  pThe issue is that JPype causes our application to ungracefully and silently crash if we allocate too much memory. A try catch doesnt even get triggered on the statement above.p  pIm wondering if theres a way to use java from command line to determine how much memory we can allocate on a computer. We can check if its 32bit or 64bit which helps, but we need to make sure they arent running other programs taking up heap space on the JVM. If they are, our application will crash.p  pReaders Digest Wed like to allocate 500mb of heap space when initializing the JVM, but cant be sure of how much space is currently being used. If we allocate too much, the entire application silently crashes.p  pWe use the following JPype 0.5.4.2 Python 2.7 Java 1.8 or 1.7 64bit or 32bitp  pThanks.p

Negative 581 pIm just starting with Python and because Im an experienced R user I found that PANDAS would fit to the following situation. I tried to describe it clearly, so p  pThe situation is p  blockquote   ul   liLarge dataframe filled with 0s with colnames and rownames dimensions 85558 x 85558li   liTabdelimited file.li   ul blockquote  pMy questionp  blockquote   ul   lihow can efficiently iterate over each cell of the dataframe, and fill with counts if succesful comparisons are achieved between information contained in colnames AND rownames vs flags present at each line of the file parsedli   ul blockquote  pI already have a function which will compare rownamescolnames vs flags. So lets suppose that once  efficient access to each cell is achieved call the function i.ex. strongcompareandcountstrong, parse colnames and rownames as arguments, and return a count or not. Logically, counts will be added to the dataframe cells, and if previous counts are present then will sum it. p  pJust as additional information here is a preview of the dataframep  precode    chr602000 chr620004000  chr640006000  chr660008000  ... chr6171114000171115067 chr602000 0   0   0   0   ... 0 chr620004000  0   0   0   0   ... 0 chr640006000  0   0   0   0   ... 0                 chr6171110000171112000    0   0   0   0   ... 0 chr6171112000171114000    0   0   0   0   ... 0 chr6171114000171115067    0   0   0   0   ... 0 codepre  pIve tried to not reapeat already answered questions and I think this has the specifity that is a large dataframe which information about rownames and colnames have to be considered carefully.p  pI thank everybody who can add its knowledge to the answerp  pBestp  p strongEDITstrong p  pAs additional explanation, because suggested by the comments here is my typical input and the desired outputp  pThe input consist of a series of grouped coordinates delimited by lines. Each line has to be treated separately one from anotherp  precodeIds CHR1   START1 CHR2   START2 id1 chr6    1   chr6    100 id2 chr6    1995    chr6    2200 id3 chr6    2300    chr6    2500 id4 chr6    3300    chr6    3500 id5 chr6    3447    chr6    3658 id6 chr6    5000    chr6    5100 id7 chr6    5050    chr6    5150 id8 chr6    6000    chr6    6100 codepre  pAs you can see in the first Dataframe there are a bunch coordinates as rownames and colnames. The objective then, is to map the linegrouped coordinates from the file in the big dataframe. For example, the following coordinatep  precodeid1 chr6    1   chr6    100 codepre  pShould only be counted in strongcell[1,1]strong because the start1 and start2 are in between 02000. However, the next coordinatep  precodeid2 chr6    1995    chr6    2200 codepre  pShould only be counted in strongcell[1,2]strong because the start1 is between 02000 strongBUTstrong start2 is in between 20004000.p  pThe final output will be the matrix with the grouped coordinates mapped in the dataframep  precode    chr602000 chr620004000  chr640006000  chr660008000  ... chr6171114000171115067 chr602000 1   2   0   0   ... 0 chr620004000  0   1   0   0   ... 0 chr640006000  0   0   1   0   ... 0                 chr6171110000171112000    0   0   0   0   ... 0 chr6171112000171114000    0   0   0   0   ... 0 chr6171114000171115067    0   0   0   0   ... 0 codepre  pAs you can denote, for this example I do not take into consideration if there are different IDs in the same line, which therefore is something can be solved with a combination of ifelse statements with a slightly different Dataframe.

Negative 581 pWhen switching from Qt 4.8 to Qt 5.x you may notice that each time you save XML document it produce random attribute order inside the file. It makes no problem for programaticaly reading the XML document because attributes are allowed to be stored in any order when XML is deserialized. It is a problem when you track changes of output XML files using GIT, SVN, etc.  it is not possible to tell if the data inside XML file changed or the attribute structure changed.p  pIs it possible to generate XML files in Qt 5.x the same way as in Qt 4.8p

The issue is when icmp reply received, then each thread is notifying  by select, although each thread has its own socket and socket descriptor.p  pI know that i can use icmpid as reply delimiter, but i wont any call to be passed  to thread for foreign replies, because it causes thread wakes up.p  pMoreover, when only two threads running, there are two PCB Protocol Control Blocks for IP sockets. Netstat shows two different PCB with unique PCB address marked as  IP socket, anysourceIPanysourcePort And actually, each of PCB has packets in RecvQ when replies received.p  pis there a way to really completely split such sockets without packet fields changing or binding sockets to different source IPp  pjust verified, the same behavious with two different processes. Reading raw sockets specifications i found that if using anysourceIPanysourcePort ip,icmp then there is no possible information to make unique PCB, but i have a PCBs for each socket.p  pbUpdateb Im new with this, but that bahaviour seems to be very known. Specifications states Also in the linux the received datagram on the raw socket affects not only all sockets in process, but all socket with the same IP layer system wide. With BSD raw socket is the last resort handler for all ICMP types which kernel doesnt handle itself, and not only... Sadly, but seems there is no a trick to setup raw socket in such a way so the kernel pass only data which application is waiting for, as kernel does not handle any packet fields to make right decision. It is by raw nature itsel. Correct me.p

Clearly, authorization works fine. However, redirection does not work, as the routing is handled by Angular. After authorization I never land on codeprofilecode but on the default Angular route. p  pTherefore, I tried with a custom callback as suggested by Passport.js a hrefhttppassportjs.orgguideauthenticate relnofollowherea, with the hope of passing json data to Angular, and let Angular do the routing. I ended up doing something likep  precode In the controller http.getconnectfacebook.successfunctiondata      here I wait for json data from the server and do the routing   I call this route from Angular app.getconnectfacebook,isLoggedIn,passport.authorizefacebook,       scope  email    But Facebook lands here app.getconnectfacebookcallback,functionreq, res, next      passport.authorizefacebook, functionerr, user, info          res.jsonsomethingsmtg         ... codepre  pClearly custom callbacks work for locallogin, as Passport.js explains. But here do you see the problem I call codeconnectfacebookcode from Angular, but I should receive some json from codeconnectfacebookcallbackcode.p  pI am about to give up Passport, but before this, do you see any solution which would allow landing on codeprofilecode after FB authorization, perhaps with a custom message Many thanks for reading through.p

Negative 581 pTrying to get my head around working with claims and Identity Framework 2.0 with Owin and Web API.  Need some help figuring out where to construct new claims.p  pWe use Owin for token authentication host level and a custom user managerstore against legacy tables.  Will be adding claims that represent organizational relationships like type is Department and value as Economy.p  pLets say over the wire from the client we want to get strongTagsstrong that a user can put on a strongDocumentstrong.  XHR calls to the Web Api should based off claim information return a particular set of strongTagsstrong.  It would be cool if I could in the context of a specific Web API controller apply a authentication policy either via Owin or the Web API that adds a claim prior to authorization.  Is this possible  Inside that policy I could determine from existing claims what transient claim to add so that the controller method stays clean from policy rules.p  pFor example, a user has an existing claim DepartmentEconomy then in the emGet Tags caseem the claimset passed to authorization on the controller method would have a transient claim called TagsFinancial.  Where the value Financial in the claim tells the controller method to even include tags that have to do with finance not just tags created by the user or their department.p  pWhat I have read so far with claim sets and adding claims is usually done through services i.e. via IAuthorizationPolicy.  Assuming I can hook into the Web API flow or the Owin pipeline can I do similar stuff as expected with strongIAuthorizationPolicy.Evaluatestrong but in the context of Web API method callp
Negative 581 pI am fighting a faddish problem. After several days of running Asp.Net 4.5 site becomes not responsible. My configuration Windows 7, IIS 7.5, 64 bit, 16Gb. Memory consumption of application is small and should not be an issue w3wp.exe takes around 500Mb of memory during its lifetime.p  pIve checked the Application Pool and it was in running state. So my first guess was that there should be a deadlock inside garbage collection process. All threads in applicateon are suspended by GC and new requests are not allowed to be assigned new threads, so all requests just hang.p  pSo Ive collected the process dump and gave it to DebugDiag for analyzing. And memory analysis confirmed my guess. It issued me a warningp  blockquote   pThe process is currently in the middle of a garbage collectionp blockquote  pThen I switched to crushhang analysis to look at the threads. Usually the reason fo GC to hang is having a thread with emPreemptiveem mode disabled.

Negative 581 pI am making used of a Tamura texture feature extraction from a library JFeatureLib. p  pTamura feature is an approach that explores texture representation from a different angle since it is motivated by the psychological studies on human visual perception of textures. One of its most important feature is strongcoarsenessstrong the other being brightness and contrast. p  pI am having difficulties with understanding the real meaning of the coarseness feature. From the literature I found that a coarse texture consists of a small number of large primitives, while a fine texture contains a large amount of small primitives. A more precise definition might bep  blockquote   pThe higher the coarseness value is, the rougher is the texture. If   there are two different textures, one macro texture of high coarseness   and one micro texture of low coarseness, the macro texture is   considered.p blockquote  pHowever, I cannot see any relation between the coarseness value and the roughness of the image.p  pExample in my opinion the coarseness value of the images below should increase from left to right. However, I am getting the following coarseness values p  pcode1.93155, 3.23740, 2.40476, 3.11979 left to rightcode. p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comXCgKm.png altAccording to my coarseness should increase from left to right  p  pI am finding it quite strange that coarseness2 is higher than coarseness3 and coarseness4.

Negative 581 pIm developing a plugin architecture to allow the execution of heterogeneous tasks through the use of appropriate plugin, which would be loaded from one or more libraries DLL files from a specified directory.p  pFirst I worked on defining the interface that must be implemented by each plugin, so I created the following C interface.p  precodepublic interface ITaskProcessor      string Name  get      string Version  get      string Author  get      string Description  get       void ExecuteStream sourceStream, Stream destStream  codepre  pIn essence, in defining this interface, Im assuming that the data relating to a task must be previously stored in a file and that the results will be stored in another file. For this reason, the codeExecutecode method requires two codeStreamcode objects as parameters.p  pThe opening and closing of both streams are operations common to all plugins, so I decided to perform them in the class codeTaskProcessorContextcode, as follows.p  precodepublic class TaskProcessorContext      private ITaskProcessor mTaskProcessor      public TaskProcessorContextITaskProcessor executor              mTaskProcessor  executor           public void Executestring sourceFileName, string destFileName              InternalExecutesourceFileName, destFileName           private void InternalExecutestring sourceFileName, string destFileName              FileStream sourceStream  null         FileStream destStream  null          try                      sourceStream  File.OpenReadsourceFileName             destStream  new FileStreamdestFileName, FileMode.Create, FileAccess.Write              mTaskProcessor.ExecutesourceStream, destStream    invoking the method of a plugin                  catch ArgumentNullException e                      throw new ArgumentNullExceptione.ParamName, e.Message                  catch ArgumentException e                      throw new ArgumentExceptione.Message, e.ParamName, e                  catch FileNotFoundException e                      throw new FileNotFoundExceptione.Message, e.FileName, e                  catch DirectoryNotFoundException e                      throw new DirectoryNotFoundExceptione.Message, e                  catch PathTooLongException e                      throw new PathTooLongExceptione.Message, e                  catch UnauthorizedAccessException e                      throw new UnauthorizedAccessExceptione.Message, e                  catch NotSupportedException e                      throw new NotSupportedExceptione.Message, e                  catch IOException e                      throw new IOExceptione.Message, e                  catch System.Security.SecurityException e                      throw new System.Security.SecurityExceptione.Message, e                  finally                      if sourceStream  null                              sourceStream.Close                 sourceStream.Dispose                 sourceStream  null                           if destStream  null                              destStream.Close                 destStream.Dispose                 destStream  null                             codepre  pI thought it appropriate to catch and rethrow all exceptions that may occur during the opening of the stream, passing the raised exception as inner exception in order to avoid losing the stack trace.p  pIf the two streams are opened correctly, ie if no exceptions occur when opening the stream, then the codeExecutecode method of a certain plugin is invoked.p  pClearly, you can not know in advance the processing operations performed by each plugin, so its not even possible to know in advance the exceptions that might occur during such processing. However, I need a way to know any errors that occur during the execution of the codeExecutecode method of a plugin in other words, I would like that the codeExecutecode method of each plugin may throw additional exceptions, but the codeTaskProcessorContext.Executecode method should catch it and rethrow it without losing the stack trace...p  pIt seems to me that the only way to manage this is to define a class to use for exceptions thrown by the plugins. For example, I could create the class codeTaskProcessingExceptioncode, so any exceptions that occur within the codeExecutecode method of a specific plugin should be rethrown using this new class, as in the following examplep  precodepublic class PluginExample  ITaskProcessor       ...      public void ExecuteStream sourceStream, Stream destStream              try                       ...                  catch SomeSpecificException e                      throw new TaskProcessingExceptione.Message, e                  finally                       ...                codepre  pAs a consequence, I should also add the following code to the codeExecutecode method of the codeTaskProcessorContextcode class, in order to catch codeTaskProcessingExceptioncode from the pluginsp  precodecatchTaskProcessingException e      throw new TaskProcessingExceptione.Message, e  codepre  pIn this way, users of the codeTaskProcessorContextcode class would have the ability to catch and manage all exceptions that may occur during the call to its codeExecutecode method.p  pIs the above approach correct Are there alternative approachesp  pstrongUPDATEstrongp  pI modified the codeTaskProcessorContext.Executecode method, so that exceptions thrown by specific implementations of codeITaskProcessorcode interface are relaunched within a custom TaskProcessingException, so that the caller can know where the exception occurred and handle it properly.p  precodepublic void Executestring sourceFileName, string destFileName      FileStream sourceStream  null     FileStream targetStream  null      try              sourceStream  File.OpenReadsourceFileName         targetStream  new FileStreamdestFileName, FileMode.Create, FileAccess.Write          try                      mTaskProcessor.ExecutesourceStream, targetStream                  catch Exception e                       Catch and rethrow the exceptions              launched from a specific plugin.             throw new TaskProcessingExceptione.Message, e                   catch              throw          finally              if sourceStream  null                      sourceStream.Close             sourceStream.Dispose             sourceStream  null                   if targetStream  null                      targetStream.Close             targetStream.Dispose             targetStream  null                codepre

Negative 581 pWhy is there not an API for determining what socket options have actually been set security  But the local and remote end points are available anywayp  pAside from deriving the socket and manually storing the information how can one get all options in use on a socket without iterating over any possible option p  pDeriving is relevant, only because you can keep track of the information you need yourself such as the options size and if its a physically set option as well.p  pMy main question primarily though is as followsp  pAfter having the required information how can one easily determine which of those options are not going to take up space in the payload section defined by the MTUp  pMax Segment Size, Dont Fragment etc DO take up size in the payload which is described by the MTU, possibly contrary to popular beliefp  pI would like to know this information before performing a send or receive on the socket if possible. p  pPlease be as platform agnostic as possible,e.g. use only the Berkeley Socket API methods and not system calls.p  pExample programming language can be whatever you program in to be accepted. p  pemUPDATEemp  pHeres an existing question which uses lsof as a solution although its os specific a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions1824115displaysocketoptionsDisplay socket optionsa. p  pUnfortunately it looks like I will have to research a bit to adopt this to Windows because im not sure such an analogous exists there, if not I might release pssockets to add to the useful pstools arsenal.p  pemUPDATEem a hrefhttpwww.thegeekstuff.com201203ipprotocolheader relnofollowhttpwww.thegeekstuff.com201203ipprotocolheaderap  pThat is the ip header and proves options can take up space and also that the header can be up to 60 bytes When using options 4 bit max is 15  4  60.p  pemUPDATEem The biggest problem with the existing solution above is that it WILL NOT display options In the IP header it will only display options which are present on the socket instance.p  pMy question specifically was to get the socket options which take up space in the ip header which the application doesnt have access to at the protocol level. p

But after very long periods 12 hours, the buffer of the first device, becomes to full because the second devices clock is a few milliseconds faster per hour.p  pNow the easy solution is to let the first device throw away a sample from the buffer sometimes if the buffer becomes a little full. And skip a sample now and then if the buffer becomes a little empty.p  pHowever, creating a smart algorithm with moving averages, to calculate when and how many samples I should correct, has already cost me two days, and still is not really good. p  pIs there a standard method or code to do this, instead of reinventing the wheelp

Negative 581 pSo I had a 2 screen app all working, a main ViewController, and another ViewController, which segues on a button press. This all works fine, and still does.p  pI then created a new ViewController, added a TableView to it, embedded a Navigation controller and set up my table. I created a segue to it, which happens by pressing in a textField. It all works fine, but occasionally, when its supposed to segue to the TableView VC, it just shows a black screen. No errors are reported, the screen is just black, and it never changes. Sometimes however its all fine. It seems to appear after Ive changed the table in some way. Whats more annoying is, when it does work on the simulator, if i then try to run the build to my device iPhone 6 , there is still a black screen when the segue happens. I dont really know what code will be useful to show you, so please ask if you want to see some.

Negative 581 pI am comparing branches with codesvn mergeinfo httpmyserver.combranchesFeatureBranch httpmyserver.combranchesUAT showrevs eligiblecode which shows if anything is in the feature branch but not in UAT.p  pHowever, someone has created a branch from a branch and made 2 commits.

If it is a nonweak reference, wouldnt it be a strong reference, then So the NSNotificationCenter would still be an owner, so the object wouldnt deallocate until manually unregistered, so its nonsensical in this context to say its zeroing.p  pIf this is referring to a sort of codeunsafeunretainedcode reference, then the question ishow then would NSNotificationCenter avoid messaging a zombiep

Negative 581 pMy problem is I have a very large time series 510 million obs that have certain events marked with flags. In this case it is a drop in stock prices that triggers an event that has a dummy variable for that is 1 or 0 if the event is triggered or not. From this time series I would like to extract both the events themselves and the subsequent 29 days of data. Obviously, this involves some type of splicing of arrays.p  pI have some simple code which should do the trick it merely marks the flags and the next 29 days as 2 but from there it is simple to filter the dataframe but it relies on pandas dataframe splicing which is not very quick. Here is the codep  precodedef firstdropdf     indexlen  lendf.dropflag[df.dropflag1].index      for y in rangeindexlen                                                                                                                                        x  df.dropflag[df.dropflag1].index[y]             df.dropflag[x30]2      return df.dropflag  dstk[dropflag2]  dstk[[permno,dropflag]].groupbypermno.applyfirstdrop  codepre  pIs there a faster way anyone else has found to do this type of splicing where you get the next x number of entries I am thinking it is maybe faster with numpy arrays or maybe a cythonized function but I cant quite see where to start. p

Negative 581 pGreetings SO community     I have a REST, jersey based, application. This applicationdue to nature of its clients receives same http requests 36 of them at roughly the same time 25s apart. Each request takes around 10s to process and brings back a ton of data hitting DB, doing data massaging etc. In an ideal world Id like to avoid having to process the same request multiple times and was thinking of coding some sort of request filter that would only allow unique requests go through, whist others would be blocked until such time when the allowed one returns.  Blocked requests would also then return the same data to the caller by looking up cached response on the serverp  pWhat are the proscons of this approach Are there any better solutions to this other than changing client logic p

Negative 581 pI have an issue with my Angular project and dont really see how to solve it. I have a table with checkboxes on each row each row representing a question item.

A workaround would be to put the ngclick event on each cell except the one containing the checkbox but I think it is not really a pretty way to do it.p  pDo you have any idea p

Negative 581 pThe Problem I have is that I store datetime as utc by setting it like sop  precode   container.DateToStore  DateTime.UtcNow codepre  pI am using the database first approach.  Which means that my Entity Models are recreated when I update my model from the database.  Which means that any solution that modifies the model will need to account for the model being recreated ie code in an outside partial class.  My code looks at this properly and has the correct kind value of Utc for the DateTime DateType.  When I save it to the database it looks like the correct UTC value.  But when the value is retrieved from the database and set to another variable the kind value is lost.  It is now none.  p  precode DateTimeToPassToOutisideSystem  DateTimeFromDatabaseEntity codepre  pDateTimeToPassToOutsideSystem.Kind  unknown at this point.  Which the outside system converts to UTC and adds hours to what I passed over.  p  pI want to avoid having my code modify the DateTime zone issue everytime I attempt to use the value.  p  precode DateTimeToSend  new DateTimeMyDateTimeFromDb.Value.Ticks, DateTimeKind.Utc codepre  pCan I set the datatype in sql in such a way that it will automatically be recognized as utc when the Entitiy model is created Or do I need to build an Extension method of some sort to handle this.p  pNOTE  I found an easy way to handle this for my purposes was to just add an extension method on the DateTime object. It is simple and works for my purposes  Here is the codep  precode public static class DateTimeExtensions       public static DateTime SetKindAsUtcthis DateTime dt              return DateTime.SpecifyKinddt, DateTimeKind.Utc        codepre  pNow when I know the time is in UTC but is not set correctly by the Kind property I call it like sop  precode outSideDateTimeValue  MyDateTime.SetKindAsUtc codepre

Negative 581 pstrongEDITstrong The question about why the code in this question works has been answered by the linked question in the duplicate marking. The question about string literal lifetime is answered in the answer to this question.p  pI am trying to understand how and when the string pointed to by codeconst char code gets deallocated.p  pConsiderp  precodeconst char p  nullptr       const char t  test     p  ampt   cout ltlt p codepre  pAfter leaving the inner scope I would expect codepcode to be a dangling pointer to codeconst char code. However in my tests it is not. That would imply that the value of codetcode actually continues to be valid and accessible even after codetcode gets out of scope.p  pIt could be due to prolonging the lifetime of the temporary by binding it to const reference. But I do no such thing and even by saving the reference to codetcode in a member variable and printing the value from different function later still gives me its correct value.p  precodeclass CStringTest  public     void test1               const char t  test         mP  ampt         test2           void test2                cout ltlt mP       private     const char mP  nullptr  codepre  pSo what is the lifetime of the codetcodes value here I would say I am invoking undefined behaviour by dereferencing a pointer to a value of a variable that went out of scope. But it works every time so I think that is not the case.p  pWhen trying some other type like codeQStringcodep  precodeQString p  nullptr       QString str  test     p  ampstr   cout ltlt p codepre  pthe code always prints the value correctly too even though it should not. codestrcode went out of scope with its value and I have not prolonged its lifetime by binding it to const reference either.p  pInterestingly the class example with codeQStringcode behaves as I would expect and codetest2code prints gibberish because the value indeed went out of scope and codemPcode became dangling pointer.p  pSo what is the actual lifetime of codeconst char codes valuep
