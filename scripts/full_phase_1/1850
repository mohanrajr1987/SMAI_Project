Positive 1850 pIm struggling with some garbage collection  allocation concepts in Java. Ill use the example below to illustrate my misunderstanding.p  pI have an Android application where Im collecting data from sensors and storing the values in an array that never exceeds N samples. Using Android Studio I am able to watch a live view of Free vs Allocated memory. As my app runs I can watch the allocated memory slowly increase and the free memory decrease. When the free memory approaches 0, the system runs a garbage collect and I see the Allocated memory drop significantly. Sometimes when the free memory approaches 0 the system will both do a garbage collection which will increase my allocated memory but will also increase the memory overhead.p  p1 If the allocated memory drops to original levels when a garbage collection is performed does that mean that I do not have a memory leak It is my understanding that a memory leak would mean that a garbage collection wouldnt be able to free the allocated memory.p  p2 Does the fact that allocated memory continues to increase even though the array size is limited to N samples indicate that Im doing unnecessary allocation in my application Once the array hits N samples I do an array.remove0 prior to doing an array.add. I would think that once N samples were in the array the allocated memory would not continue to increase.p

As part of it, I wrote a static method that is supposed to recursively operate on its input by calling itself with varied versions of the board, a strongPiece  board[8][8]strong, and pass back the the location of the best version of the board inside a strongstduniqueptrstrong, which is the return type of the method.p  pNode is defined as suchp  precodeclass node      public     node     node     stduniqueptrltnodegt l     stduniqueptrltnodegt r     stduniqueptrltnodegt m     node  best     int bestval      Piece  board[8]  codepre  pThe goal is to eventually have the result of the initial call to the recursive method contain a best value which links to the whole chain of best path choices through the chessboard.  I would then draw the series of board states that result.p  pAs part of this, the board must be preserved.  Whichever board wins at each recursive step gets copied to dynamic memory, and the board pointer of the return  strongPiece  board[8]strong in the strongnodestrong declaration is set to this dynamically allocated memory.p  pThis is done like sop  precode    stduniqueptrltnodegt ret new node     Piece  reboard  new Piece[8]     for int i  0 i lt 8 i              reboard[i]  new Piece[8]          ...code to copy values to reboard and set other ret property values...     retgtboard  reboard     return ret codepre  pAll the local values of the winning chess board are then copied to reboard.  This all works fine.  If I copy all the values of reboard to a global board at this stage, return, and directly draw that global board to the screen, it draws the correct result.  Likewise, if I set strongretboardstrong to point to that global board and then copy values to the global board and return, it draws the correct values.p  pBut, if I do what Ive written above and try to draw strongretboardstrong, I get invalid memory access errors in my draw method, and Im pulling my hair out trying to pin this problem down.  It seems that immediately after return, the memory pointed to by strongreboardstrong is reclaimed somehow.  In this memory which should only be data, I see that entries into the array appear to point to code in msctf.dll, among other invalid data pointers.  I thought it was being reclaimed by garbage collection, so Ive even tried putting in some strongstddeclarereachablestrong calls on any and every pointer I can see, but this has not helped.p  pAnyone notice recognize whats going on here  Shouldnt that dynamically allocated memory stick around until I free itp

Positive 1850 pIm storing Events in a Queue when the Android app is not in foreground. Events can be a lot, so Id like to remove the oldest, when I reach a certain limit, to avoid memory issues.

However, Im not sure that they actually give the time overhead of parallel and concurrent collectors. Do they If so, how are they calculatedp  pIs there any other options I can use with the concurrent and parallel collectorsp  pThanks.p
Positive 1850 pI am parsing in an html file that is 3mb and using Stanfords pos tagger with it, always failing because of OOM. If I have 1gb in the heap, it gives a heap error.

Positive 1850 pI have not been able to find a satisfactory explanation as to why calling GC.Collect before a large emunmanagedem allocation in my case, before creating a large 250Mb DirectX resource prevents an outofmemory exception.  Why does a compaction of the managed heap allow an unmanaged allocation  p  pHow does a .Net process share its address space between the managed and unmanaged heapsp  pMy best guess is the .Net process maintains a moveable boundary between the two types of heap and GC.Collect allows that boundary to move in favour of a larger unmanaged heap.

Positive 1850 pI have multiple instances of a certain viewmodel. This viewmodel has an object of a videoPlayer i created, and event handlers propertychanged, etc.p  pI realized viewing the performance monitor that when i created new instances the private memory goes up. But then when i close that viewmodels Removing the reference i have for them in other class the memory is still high.p  pI did a heap memory dump to see why GC does not clean them and I see the event handlers. Well i did a method to unregister them and saw what happen to the memory heap, the viewmodels are still there but the event handler references dissapear.  So i dont know what instances of viewModels are still there.  From the Paths to Root option where i saw the references to event handlers now I only see cycled dependencies. What things i can search For other viewModels without the videoPLayer object when i remove the eventHandlers the GC clean them.p  pSo i think that something happen with that object. Bu i dont see nothing in Path To Root.p

Positive 1850 pI am not much aware of memory management, garbage collector and how threads allocate and deallocate memory in java. I am working on a core java application which parses a binary file and keeps it in memory from there we save the data to DB. But, as the data in the binary file is increased its exceeding the heap limit and generating dump.p  pThreads are being used in this I see that the memory is not getting decreased after the thread complition also. Could you please provide some information on this or some link where I can find some material regarding to memory management, GC and thread memory management.p  pThanksp  pShyam Kishorep

Positive 1850 pSo I have code that grabs a list of files from a directory that initially had over 14 millions files. This is a hexcore machine with 20 GB RAM running Ubuntu 14.04 desktop and just grabbing a list of files takes hours  I havent actually timed it.p  pOver the past week or so Ive run code that doesnt nothing more than gather this list of files, open each file to determine when it was created, and move it to a directory based on the month and year it was created. The files have been both scpd and rsyncd so the timestamp the OS provides is meaningless at this point, hence opening the file.p  pWhen I first started running this loop it was moving 1000 files in about 90 seconds. Then after several hours like this that 90 seconds became 2.5 min, then 4, then 5, then 9, and eventually 15 min. So I shut it down and started over.p  pI noticed that today once it was done gathering a list of over 9 millions files that moving 1000 files took 15 min right off the bat. I just shut the process down again and rebooted the machine because the time to move 1000 files had climbed to over 90 min.p  pI had hoped to find some means of doing a codewhile  list.popcode style strategy to free memory as the loop progressed. Then found a couple of SO posts that said it could be done with codefor i in list ... list.remove...code but that this was a terrible idea.p  pHeres the codep  precodefrom basicconfig.startupconfig import   arcdir  varwwwdatavisits  def step1movefilestoarchivedirsfiles       return       cntr  0   for f in files       cntr  1        if phpbasicfiles.fileexistsf is False           continue        try           visit  json.loadsphpbasicfiles.filegetcontentsf       except           continue        fname  phpbasicfiles.basenamef        try           dt  datetime.fromtimestampvisit[Entrance Time]       except KeyError           continue        mYr  dt.strftimeBY         Move the lead to Monthly archive       arcpath  arcdir  mYr         if not os.path.existsarcpath           os.makedirsarcpath, 0777        if not os.path.existsarcpath           print Directory  was not created.formatarcpath       else            Move the file to the archive           newFile  arcpath  fname           print File moved to .formatnewFile           os.renamef, newFile        if cntr  1000 is 0           print  files moved .formatcntr, datetime.fromtimestamptime.time.isoformat  def step2combinevisitsinto1file       return       filedirs  phpbasicfiles.globarcdir      for fd in filedirs     arcfiles  phpbasicfiles.globfd  .raw     arcfname  arcdir  phpbasicstr.strreplace, , phpbasicstr.strreplacearcdir, , fd  .arc      try       arcfiledata  phpbasicfiles.filegetcontentsarcfname     except       arcfiledata        for f in arcfiles       uniqID  moduleName  phpadvstr.fetchBefore., phpbasicfiles.basenamef        if uniqID not in arcfiledata         visit  json.loadsphpbasicfiles.filegetcontentsf         arcfiledata[uniqID]  visit      phpbasicfiles.fileputcontentsarcfname, json.dumpsarcfiledata   def main       return       files  phpbasicfiles.globvarwwwhtmlver1phpVisitorTrackingdataraw   print Num of Files .formatlenfiles    step1movefilestoarchivedirsfiles   step2combinevisitsinto1file codepre  pNotesp  pbasicconfig is essentially a bunch of constants I have for the environment and a few commonly used libraries like all the phpbasic libraries. I used PHP for years before picking up Python so I built a library to mimic the more common functions I used in order to be up and running with Python faster.p  pThe step1 def is as far as the program gets so far. The step2 def could, and likely should, be run in parallel. However, I figured IO was the bottleneck and doing even more of it in parallel would likely slow all functions down a lot more. I have been tempted to rsync the archive directories to another machine for aggregation thus getting parallel speed without the IO bottleneck but figured the rsync would also be quite slow.p  pThe files themselves are all 3 Kb each so not very large.p  p Final Thoughts p  pLike I said, it doesnt appear, to me at least, that any data is being stored from each file opening. Therefore memory should not be an issue. However, I do notice that only 1.2 GB of RAM is being used right now and over 12 GB of was being used before. A big chunk of that 12 could be storing 14 million file names and paths.

Positive 1850 pMy project has started using java 8 from java 7. p  pAfter switching to java 8, we are seeing issues like the memory consumed is getting higher  with time.p  pIt seems that the java 8 garbage collection is not working properly.p  pWhen we switch back to java 7, the memory consumption again gets back to normal. We have explored 3 different version of java 8 and facing issues in all of those versions. p  pAs java 8 has done some changes with GC. Removing permanent Gen is one of those changes. But those changes are supposed to lessen the memory consumption but we are facing the reversep  pI just wanted to know has anyone else has faced this issue, or any thoughts on how can we resolve thisp  pEDIT  As of now we are monitoring strongprivate bytes consumed which increases while using java 8strong, and also we are observing this issue strongonly while using RMIstrong.p

Positive 1850 pi am trying to make a robust application that can download  blob files from a mysql server. The files are executables or other binary files. The download itself works well, but i want to bullet proof it to survive an internet cutoff midway in a download.

On the other hand ,if i cutoff the internet 5 seconds into the execution of the preparedstatement.execute,the thread that is downloading hangs indefinitely and is never cleared by the Garbage collector and the program never exits. The main exits,the downloader manager exits,but the downloading thread never exits.

During this phase, all threads of the application are suspended.p  p2 During concurrent marking, the marked root objects are traversed and all reachable objects are marked. This phase is fully concurrent with application execution, so all application threads are active and can even allocate new objects. For this reason there might be another phase that marks objects that have been allocated during the concurrent marking.

Negative 1850 pI am planning on using the CacheDuration Attribute with my WebMethods. I have the webmethod code wrapped in a trycatch and the exceptions are logged to the database. after handling the exception, i return the error message in the response object lets call it ABCResponseInfo, so the calling client can know about the error. this instance of ABCResponseInfo goes back with just the error message and all other data members set to null.p  pi am assuming that this ABCResponseInfo instance with the error state is Cached and if the calling client retries, the same ABCResponseInfo is returned, if the subsequent call comes in, within the next CacheDuration seconds.p  pis there some way to avoid this from happening i am thinking, rethrowing the exception to the client is one possible way.. but i am not convinced that its the only way to handle this situation. p  pany other ideasp

Negative 1850 pEvery once in awhile I am fed a large data file that my client uploads and that needs to be processed through CMFL. The problem is that if I put the processing on a CF page, then it runs into a timeout issue after 120 seconds. I was able to move the processing code to a CFC where it seems to not have the timeout issue. However, sometime during the processing, it causes ColdFusion to crash and has to restarted. There are a number of database queries 5 or more, mixture of updates and selects required for each line 8,000 of the file I go through as well as other logic provided by me in the form of CFML. p  pMy question is what would be the best way to go through this file. One caveat, I am not able to move the file to the database server and process it entirely with the DB. However, would it be more efficient to pass each line to a stored procedure that took care of everything It would still be a lot of calls to the database, but nothing compared to what I have now. Also, what would be the best way to provide feedback to the user about how much of the file has been processedp  pEdit Im running CF 6.1p

Negative 1850 pWhat is the best way to trigger an animation while using the MVVM pattern More specifically, I have a form which has several fields. When a user clicks the save codeButtoncode, I would like to show an animation. I have been able to achieve this by exposing a property strongShowMessagestrong and setting it to True and a codeDataTriggercode picks up this value and starts an animation. However, while the animation is still active, I would like to reset the form to a clean state. So far Ive done the reset by subscribing to the codeCompletecode event on the codeStoryboardcode and resetting the view models state on that event. p  pIdeally I would like to be able to somehow trigger an animation from the view model because the save would be an asynchronous operation and let the animation run to completion. The way I have it now wouldnt work because once I change the value of the strongShowMessagestrong property on the reset, the animation stops and doesnt run to completion.p  pDoes any one have a better solutionp  pThanksp

Negative 1850 pWe have a sharepoint 2007 project at work. The exception handling policy is to log to the Sharepoint logs.p  pIn this case, would the best approach be to call that method and then rethrow the exception higher up Except if I rethrow it to be caught higher up, there is no other exception handling code so what would happen in this casep  pAlso, if you are going to display a more friendly error to the user which uses information in the exception object, then this would be a good use of exception wrapping. Would it be a good idea to make a custom aspx page and add these to customerrors, so that on init not sure of the exact event, I can display exception info in the passed parameter on the page. However, a static html page cant do this so I dont see the point in wrapping exceptions unless there is a page or alert which uses the exception object.

Negative 1850 pIm new to TDD approach so Im wondering if anyone experienced wit this could enlighten me a little. I would like to get some leads how to use UML and TDD methodology together.p  pIve been used to Design with UML  Generate skeleton classes and then keep it synchronized  Implement and finally Test. I must admit that testing part was the worst one, so I started to look for something else  TDD. So I have some general knowledge what is it about but before I proceed further, I am interested knowing how it goes together with software design especially UML.p  pSo when I first designcreate test, how can UML fit in Would it be possible to design classes first, from them create skeleton classes, from them generate Unit tests which would be filled before actual implementation of UML pregenerated classes, would this approach break whole TDD Or is there any other way that would keep UML and TDD togetherp

Negative 1850 pRevised for content qualityp  pWe had built forms based application for a customer based on their requirements. Toward the end of the project, they decided they wanted the app to function as a part of another Winforms app in a way that required the screens to be contained within larger forms. They also wanted to dynamically load forms and other UI elements. I decided to try simply loading forms dynamically inside another form, at at the time, wasnt comfortable with changing over all of the forms to controls.p  pWhen I load a form dynamically inside another form or container control, the editing behavior of the inner forms components changes. Text editing, in a TextBox or ComboBox, does not allow me to select partial text with the mouse, though I can double click to select all the text in the control.p  precode     FormChild form  new FormChild      form.TopLevel  false      form.Dock  DockStyle.Fill      Controls.Clear      Controls.Addform      form.Show codepre  pThe controls work as expected when I show the form normally, using Show or ShowDialog, but not when nested.p  pBeing a bit new to Winforms from years of MFC, we had experience embedding forms inside MFC controls using FormView without issues, so assumed it would work ok with Winforms. It didnt turn out that way.p  pstrongSOLUTIONstrong I should have used a User Control in the first place. I refactored every form in the app manually, created blank controls, cut and pasted the InitializeComponent as well as the logic into a User Control. As for the dynamic components, nowadays I create them at runtime, or do them in IronPython. Four years later Im looking back at this question, shaking my head at my rookie mistake.p  pIn addition, Ive found that controls inside dockable panels work well for the original scenario I was faced with. Specifically, I started using DevExpress DocumentManager and DockPanel. My inexperience at the time with Winforms got us into trouble Ive left this question in case someone else makes the same mistake.p

Negative 1850 pWe have a web service that does a fairly high volume of traffic that helps you figure out what are your preferred contacts based on the emails you receive.  p  pThis service was initially implemented in C .NET in order to leverage some code we already have running on Windows hosts.  This service does not uses ASP.NET but its a simple C service using a base HTTP Listener from .NET. p  pThe service is performing OK, but once in a while MONO will totally blocks and stop responding to any requests.  The performance is OK, but not great and it seams that we spend a huge amount of time figuring the difference between the MONO CLR and the Windows CLR.  I must admit, I am coming from a Java background and it seems that the ecosystem on the server side is way larger on the Java side than the MONO ecosystem on Linux.p  pSo for now, I am looking for examples and personal experiences around using Mono on Linux to server a high traffic web service.p

Negative 1850 pIm using C to display a list of movie titles that I am calling from an SQLite database. Currently, Im using a custom ListBox class that has a function to sort the text stripping the word The from the beginning of every item. However, it doesnt exactly seem to be the simplest way to do it, since it calls from the SQLite database and emthenem sorts. Id prefer to cut it down to just one step, hopefully sorting straight from the database in my SELECT query.p  pIve done some searching on this, and have found some suggestions, including creating an extra sortby column in the database. While this is certainly a possibility, Im wondering if theres any simpler options that dont require inserting almost identical duplicate information especially if the database becomes larger. Im pretty new to SQLite, but Ive read something about creating a collate function that can be used to create custom ordering. However, Im not sure if this is appropriate use for it and cant seem to find any help with implementing it in C.p  pWas hoping someone might be able to share some guidance. If an extra sorting column is the best way to go, then that is what I shall do.p

Then it backgrounds so as to allow parallel execution.  This allows me to keep track of which command the output was associated with since the data could come back simultaneously and all mixed up.

It proved to be a huge timesaver in the past, and Im wondering if there is something Im missing a setting somewhere, or was this actually removed from 2008. p
Negative 1850 pPhoneGap offers a nice solution for writing crossplatform apps with HTML5 and JavaScript.p  pBut I would like to use Interface Builder for the UI, and just write all the controller code in Javascript instead of ObjectiveC with of course the option to mix and match and especially call into any ObjectiveC libraries that I may need.p  pIs there a framework for this Something akin to what CamelBones does for Perl.p  pThe reason for wanting to do this is that the nonUI code can ideally be written in JavaScript to be reused for the web version, an possible future Android PhoneGap version, and the serverside node.js.p

Negative 1850 pOur team is in the process of switching over our media library storage engine from database BLOB storage over to file system We are using the LAMP stack, PHP is ver 5.3.  Virtually all the content being stored is image data that will be pulled into the application and the most processing that will be done on it is some resizingresampling with GD.  The database storage is an artifact left over from a previous build that we are trying to abandon in order to reduce the strain on the database server.p  pI have built a few filesystembased image libraries like this before, but Id like to solidify some best practices, since this is going to get large and once it is filled with user data it will be very difficult to modify.p  pIn my previous builds, I had created a resources folder that had readwrite privileges.  Within that directory, there was an additional layer of directories that were named for what section of the site the content was pertinent to, usually organized by the name of the model or controller that implemented the stuff in there.  Under that layer were userprofile ids or numericallynamed folders that shared the number of whatever primary key in the database determined primary ownership these were typically, in this kind of deployment, gallery ids of the complilation the images came from, since ownership of the gallery by a specific user could be handled through the databaseobject models.p  pWhat kind of approaches has the community used in this situation, and which were most scalable  Is there any software for Apache that could handle this kind of organization more effectively than simply manually coding it into the models  I tried a few searches on SO and Google for similar threads on filesystem media storage, but didnt find much other than things to the effect of dont use BLOBs which weve already more or less established. Is there any hard and fast donotsp  pThanks for your guidancep

Negative 1850 pWe have an Apache CGI application written in C using cgicc extensions that currently accesses some inmemory MySQL using HEAP engine tables.  We are to the point now where the sheer number of transactions we are processing per day have exceeded the servers ability to service the queries required to service these requests.p  pOur next step we had discussed for improving performance was to make these inmemory tables more local to the CGI process and use some form of shared memory for caching the data.  Memcached or Membase seem like possible options though what we would use it for doesnt seem to agree exactly with that approach or maybe it does and I simply dont see the implementationconnection.p  pIn an ideal world we could use some form of serialization to load the data into a shared memory object.  At startup the CGI would obtain a copy or would be provided an address from which it could make a copy for itself of the shared data structure,  deserialize it into a local inmemory data structure and then do whatever comparisons it needed to do from that object.  We are really hoping this is not going to take a complete redesign of our ApacheCGI architecture but instead might simply be a matter of swapping out the querying of the MySQL inmemory tables MySQL DB is colocated on same server w Apache to using the new inmemory data structures that are more local to the process.p  pThanks for any insight someone might have on this and what they have seen done.  Many prior threads suggest using MemcachedMembase approach and perhaps that is the best route, but just wanted to see if that is the consensus.p

Negative 1850 pI have been reading a lot of tutorials about this, I have been able to use HttpClient to make a POST to spring and get the response back but it was just using a string being passed in.

All well and good, but what occurred to me is that if there was way to get my IDE VS.NET 2010 with Resharper 6 to give me a warning on any Javascript code that makes an assignment to a variable with that naming convention except in the variable declaration this would handle most of the potential issues around the lack of real constants in Javascript at least for my needs.p  pSo does anyone know of a good way to generate such warnings  InIDE would be the best thing but other solutions are fine as well.

Negative 1850 pTo what extent can a JIT replace platform independent code with processorspecific machine instructionsp  pFor example, the x86 instruction set includes the codeBSWAPcode instruction to reverse a 32bit integers byte order. In Java the codeInteger.reverseBytescode method is implemented using multiple bitwise masks and shifts, even though in x86 native code it could be implemented in a single instruction using codeBSWAPcode. Are JITs or static compilers for that matter able to make the change automatically or is it too complex or not worth it due to a poor speedtime tradeoffp  pI know that this is in most cases a microoptimisation, but Im interested none the less.p

Negative 1850 pA producer thread queries a data store and puts objects into a queue.

When the call returns, the consumer marks the object as having been completed.p  pMy problem is that I basically have to wait until the queue is empty before the producer can add to it again, or else I risk getting duplicates being sent through.  p  p[edit]  Someone asked a good question over IRC and I figured I would add the answer here.  The question was, Why do your producers produce duplicates  The answer is basically that the producer produces duplicates because we dont track a sending state of each object, only sent or unsent.p  pIs there a way that I can check for duplicates in the queue  p

I can, of course, just fall back to using PHPs native codesetcookiecode function but I feel that it should be an easy thing to do with Symfony2 as well.p  pI have an action in my controller from which I simply want to return a view with a cookie attached.

If I set the cookie without sending the headers the view is rendered but the header cookie is not sent.p  pPoking around I found the codesendHeaderscode method in the Response object so Im now manually calling that in my action before returning and that seems to workp  precodepublic function indexAction    ...   responsegtsendHeaders   return arrayvariables gt values  codepre  pBut is this really the expected pattern to use  In previous versions of symfony I could set the headers in my controller and expect the view controller to handle sending whatever I had sent.  It seems now that I must manually send them from the action to get it to work, meaning I have to call this from any action that I set headers in.  Is this the case or is there something that Im missing thats so obvious that no one has bothered to even mention it in any of the documentationp

Negative 1850 pI am doing an assignment for school where we are to make two php files. First file invokes session, generates a random 5 char string, and saves the string to the session array. The second script generates an image, and takes the string from the first file and incorporates it over the image to make a captcha.p  pI am having an issue passing the value to the second script. The session variable captchastring is fully visible in the first script, but is not passed to the second page. I am brand new at this, and frustrated. My understanding is, that as long as I start session, the entire SESSION array should be available. When I run the first script, I get a broken image tag, not the captcha i am hoping for.

Negative 1850 pIs it possible that nested calls of ioservice.runone is not a valid use of boostasio.p  pFor example I have a handler which is executed after something has been received on a socket. The ioservice is running in another thread with ioservice.runone. Hence in my opinion the ioservice will stop after serving the receive handler. p  pThen in the receive handler I am executing ioservice.runone again in order to send now something back over the socket. This means, that there is a nestedrecursive call of ioservice.runone method. p  pThis behavior doesnt really work. I mean sometimes there is a block in the runone method which never returns. I couldnt also find any documentation handling about this particular case.p  pSo, is it allowed to have recursivenested ioservice execution at all or is this not a well behaviorp  pP.S. ioservice.reset is used in front of every runone execution.p

Negative 1850 pFirstly, forgive my use of the term unit when perhaps I mean integration test. However, in this case I am treating testing of a DAO method as a unit and am not attempting to mock the underlining database. p  pIve been trying to test a particular DAO method that searches for particular entities  p  precodepublic Factor GetMatchingFactorint aircraftStoresConfigurationId, int stationId, DateTime timeStamp       code etc....  codepre  pNo, normally, I try to have several unit tests, maybe a few for each parameter to ensure each is treated appropriately. Im happy with this normally when the method itself processes the parameter, and at worse calls a dependent that I can test using mocks  stubs. However, in this particular method, the result of the method is not a pure function or one parameter, but rather a function of the parameters AND the test data. p  pTherefore, I struggle to define tests likep  precodepublic void TestThatAircraftStoresConfigurationIdParameterIsApplied public void TestThatStationIdParameterIsApplied public void TestThatTimeStampParameterIsApplied codepre  pas their names are incorrectly, each does not just test one thing.p  pThis also means that Im struggling to follow the rule of only one Assert per test. p  pTherefore, Ive tested this method using the following code with the same coverage, and possibly more meaningful. p  precode    [Test]     public void TestReturnsCorrectResult              Assert.Thatsut.GetMatchingFactor10001, Station.Station9Id,  new DateTime2011, 11, 16, 10, 00, 00.Id, Is.EqualTo1, Test 1         Assert.Thatsut.GetMatchingFactor10001, Station.Station9Id,  new DateTime2011, 11, 16, 11, 00, 00.Id, Is.EqualTo1, Test 2         Assert.Thatsut.GetMatchingFactor10001, Station.Station9Id,  new DateTime2011, 11, 16, 19, 00, 00.Id, Is.EqualTo1, Test 3         Assert.Thatsut.GetMatchingFactor10001, Station.Station9Id,  new DateTime2011, 11, 16, 19, 00, 01.Id, Is.EqualTo2, Test 4         Assert.Thatsut.GetMatchingFactor10001, Station.Station9Id,  new DateTime2011, 11, 16, 19, 00, 02.Id, Is.EqualTo2, Test 5         Assert.Thatsut.GetMatchingFactor10001, Station.Station9Id,  new DateTime2011, 11, 16, 14, 00, 00.Id, Is.EqualTo1, Test 6         Assert.Thatsut.GetMatchingFactor10001, Station.Station10Id, new DateTime2011, 11, 16, 14, 00, 00.Id, Is.EqualTo1, Test 7         Assert.Thatsut.GetMatchingFactor10002, Station.Station11Id, new DateTime2011, 11, 16, 14, 00, 00.Id, Is.EqualTo3, Test 8         Assert.Thatsut.GetMatchingFactor10002, Station.Station12Id, new DateTime2011, 11, 16, 14, 00, 00.Id, Is.EqualTo3, Test 9      codepre  pIm not comfortable with the multiple asserts, but it seems the only logical way to structure these tests.

Negative 1850 pHere is my problem. I need to implement a multi target decision tree algorithm. A multi target is an extension of multi label learning where the labels are not binary but can be continuous, categorical and so on. For example a label vector for a multi label classification problem could look like this 1,0,1,0,0,0,1, while for a multi target could look like this 2,35,3,2,24. My problem is this. If i have a label that takes 3 discrete values how do i represent them in a vector  Lets say i have a label called job and takes 3 values, mechanic,teacher and athlete. How can i code this label in order to use it in a vector  At each node in a decision tree in order to find my split, i need to compute the mean vector of all the label vectors in this node  i am using the variance method equation to find my split. If i had binary label this would be easy because adding 0s and 1s doesnt pose any problem. If i code these 3 jobs with 0,1,2, then this is problem because adding a label vector that has the label athlete, counts more than adding a vector that has the job mechanic and the mean vector is inaccurate.p  pLets take this example. I have these 3 labelsp  precode          job mechanic,teacher,athlete           marriedyes,no           age  continuous value codepre  pIt is easy to say that the married label can be coded as 0,1 and the age label as a continuous number. But how can i code the job label Coding it as 0,1,2 causes the next problem. Imagine 2 label vectors in a node 0,0,45 which corresponds to mechanic,married and 45 years old and 2,1,48 which corresponds to athlete,not married,45 years old. The mean vector is 1,0.5,46.5. With this vector i can predict that the age of the instance that falls in to that node is 46.5, i can say that the instance in not married with a rule that says greater or equal than 0.5 is 1 and i can say that its job is a teacher. The teacher job is totally wrong while the others are OK. You see now the problem of coding categorical labels. An help or advice Thanks D p

E.g. a constructor or factory method that took a seed and a desired final shape, and performed the required extrusions behind the scenes.p  pThanksp  pAddendum One hacky way to generate the desired extrusion would be to add together a suitably shaped array of zeros and a suitably reshaped seed arrayp  precodegtgtgt shape  5, 4, 3, 2 gtgtgt zeros  np.zerosshape, dtypeseed.dtype gtgtgt extrusion  seed.reshape1, 4, 1, 2  zeros codepre  pIn the shape tuple given to codeseed.reshapecode, the axes that get length 1 are those along which the extrusion will occur.

Negative 1850 pIs there a way to disable all Resharper warnings for a file or section of code with a single comment Im trying to create some coding exercises for interviewing potential candidates, and the Resharper warnings give away the problem I want the candidate to spot P Suppressing the specific warning still makes it obvious what the problem is.p  pI still want to have Resharper available during the interview, I just want the candidate to spot this problem without Resharper spoiling the fun.p  pstrongeditstrong Sorry Ill try to be more clear about what Im after. I dont want to permanently disable a particular Resharper warning, I just want it to not show in one particular file, because the point of the exercise is to see if the developer understands the reason for the warning.p  pTo give one example, there is a Resharper warning to use the .Any extension method instead of Count  0, which I want the developer to point out themselves. To disable that warning, you have to use a comment ofp  precode ReSharper disable UseMethodAny.0 codepre  paround the code. That kind of gives the game away a little.p  pI was trying to find something likep  precode ReSharper disable all codepre  pwhich I could place at the top of the class, so it wont give away what I want the developer to find. But I cant seem to find a way to do that. Using numbers for the Resharper warnings would be fine as well, but I dont think it works that wayp

Negative 1850 pI am looking for a clear explanation to my question NOT looking for code, but if a bit of code helps to explain yourself, then please do.. thank you p  pQuestionp  pusing Javap  pMain class asks user for 2 integer inputs, then places them into 2 arraylists, of type integer. Each digit is broken up and stored in its own index, so it is its own element, so to speak.p  pFor example, with my code right now, it goes something like thisp  pPlease enter an integerp  p688p  pPlease enter another integerp  p34p  pAt this point now, internally, I have stored the input as 2 arraylists, that look like thisp  pArrayList1 [6, 8, 8]p  pArrayList2 [3, 4]p  pNow, lets say I want to perform some mutliplication, such as ArrayList1  ArrayList2.p  pIll probably go ahead and create a temporary result arraylist, then move that answer over to arraylist1 when my calculation is complete.p  pBut the part I am having trouble with, is coming up with a systematic clear way to multiply the arraylists together. Keep in mind that this example uses an arraylist which represents an integer of length 3 and 2, respectively, but this could be anything. I could, for example, have an arraylist with 50 elements, such as [2, 4, 4, 3, 7, 3, 6, 3,.............] which could represent a huge number in the trillions, etc.p

Negative 1850 pI am trying to pipe XBoard chess commands over TCP.

I have read that I could use codetail fcode, but that doesnt seem to work unless I use files or FIFOs.

I therefore launch XBoard like thisp  precode.websockify 2023  xboard fcp nc q 1 k l 2023 codepre  pIt starts up and websockify seems to buffer the initial commands from XBoard. I now connect the browser like thisp  precodews  new WebSocketwslocalhost2023, base64 ws.onclose  functionconsole.logclose ws.onmessage  functionevtconsole.logwindow.atobevt.data ws.onopen  functionconsole.logopen codepre  pexecuted in the console on one linep  pIt connects and I make the first move in XBoard as white, this is the output in the browser consolep  precodeopen xboard protover 2 [2 second delay] [other commands] time 30000 otim 30000 b2b3 codepre  pEverything is good. Now I make a move as black, from the browser codews.sendwindow.btoamove b7b5ncode Works too.p  pNow, when I go and make the third move of the game in XBoard, it doesnt work anymore. Immediately after mouseup this console output appearsp  precode  1 127.0.0.1 Target closed xboard Error writing to first chess program Broken pipe xboard Error writing to first chess program Broken pipe xboard Error writing to first chess program Broken pipe xboard Error first chess program nc q 1 k l 2023 exited unexpectedly codepre  pThe GUI shows the same.p  pSo my hypothesis is that an EOF is somehow sent from XBoard to netcat after the first move. This doesnt really make sense, cause how come didnt websockify report target closed earlier And what made the first move so different from all the other commands XBoard sentp
Negative 1850 pFirst, sorry for my bad english.p  pI am using the mpstat tool in Ubuntu server to print the value of cpu percent idle every second. On the client side, I tried to send a UDP requestsecond, that the number of request increases every 60s. The server is using 8 cores, and the result of mpstat is a decrease of idle state from 100   stabilize in 80 . I believe to count the total cpu usage is by 100 minus idle state. The software that runs in the server runs as ROOT so I cant use us parameter in mpstatp  pI was thinking that this might be the case as however I increase the load, the cpu usage will peak in around 80 idle state. Is this the correct assumption  I tried to see some reference about the OS behaviour regarding the performance, but I cant find any good explanation why after jumping from 100  to 80, it stabilize whatever the number of load I send. I assume this is because the locking mechanism that the software on the server side uses, thus no more increment can be achieved.p  pWould appreciate of any pointers..p

Negative 1850 pIve started writing a crawler to crawl vbulletin boards. However, I am not a web programmer json apis I can do, but that isnt really webcrawling, and as such I do not know what the best way to crawl is, and what tools are available. p  pI am more than capable of writing the crawler, but the I find the underlying HTML very irregular, and so I dont want to be a victim of the structure of the HTML changing in a newer version of vbulletin.p  pIm writing an interface using pycurl and beautiful soup. However, is there a better way to do this, are there any good crawlers already available for vbulletin  language is not a concern. A meta forum crawler works with more than one forum type would be even better. p  pIf you cannot suggest one, could you advise me, if you have the experience, from what I should expect from the stability of the underlying HTML, should I worry about a new version of vbulletin breaking my crawler  p  pPerhaps there is a better way to extract a vbulletin dataset p

Negative 1850 pId like to compile my source or a part of it by one of my webservers like some websites offer nightly builds of their program. As I want my program to be customized by a third party and they have their own standalone application with say their logo and some custom strings in it. My preferable solution would be a dll file which would be loaded into my application, so I can still update the main application while retaining the customization by the third party.p  pSo, the third party goes to my website, enters some fields and a dll file is generated or do you have any other embetterem way to do this and the dll file will be included by the application, which will grab the logo resource and some strings from it, to show in the application.p  pHow can this be done Id rather to use Linux to build it, but if Windows is easier then thats not a problem either.p

Negative 1850 pIm using the messaging timer feature to schedule asynchronous procedure executions and all seems to be going well but I only tested it for a short time range setting the timeout to a few hours. p  pI decided upon this feature because the timer functionality is supposed to be entirely contained within single database scopecontext as opposed to depend on the server instance. As a consequence the timer should not be interfered by server restarts, database restoration from backup provided the backup has been done after the timer setup etc. If it actually works that way in practice than Ill be really glad but it seems too beautiful to be true so Id like to be able to check up on the timer. Maybe see how long till it fires even. p  pIs there a query I can run, maybe on the sys.objects table, that enables thisp

Negative 1850 pI have a dataset which is a list of prefix ranges, and the prefixes arent all the same size.

For example, value code5466160179125211code would correspond to bin a.

Negative 1850 pWhen adding Facebook comments to a wordpress site most people say to usep  precodeltfbcomments hrefltphp thepermalink gtgt codepre  pHowever,  I have a wordpress site where lots of editors edit posts.  They like to move things around and even rename the posts to reflect changes like a live post has now become just a preview now that the live part is over.  Also over time categories of posts change and many posts at once can suddenly lose all their comments as the pretty permalink changes to reflect the change of category e.g. moving a category into a new supercategory.p  pAs a result the pretty url can change also known as the permalink.  However, the Shortlink is always the same because its based on an id number of the post.p  pIve thought a good alternative would be to use echo gettheshortlink because no matter how much the pretty url changes due to the editors, the link reference would be the same.p  pBad part  This generates a warning.  Not so bad  it still works, but recently Ive noticed that warning goes public so EVERYONE can see it.   I dont want that.p  pAnyone have a better suggestion of how to solve this problem so we dont lose our valuable commentsp

An application form consists of several sections, one of those sections is Employment History codedbo.FormEmploymentcode. An employment record includes details like employer name, start date etc, but also a gradeID. A User can add one or more employment records to the table codedbo.FormEmploymentcode.p  pA system administrator can add a Shift codedbo.Shiftcode to the system, and also then assign Grades to a Shift. These Grades are recorded in the codedbo.ShiftGradecode table. A Shift can be assigned 1 or more Grades, i.e. it could be assigned 1,2,3,4 or 5 Grades.p  pWhen the system administrator has added the Shift and Shift Grades, I then want to perform an SQL query to return a list of Users whose Grades match that of the Grades assigned to a Shift remember the User adds their Grade when they add an employment record.p  pI have written the following SQL query which works, however, the issue with this query is that it returns a list of Users, that have any Grade that matches that of the Grades assigned to a Shift.p  precodeSELECT   u.userID, u.userTypeID, u.firstName, u.lastName, u.email, u.password,  u.contactNumber, u.organisationID, u.emailVerificationCode, u.mobileVerificationCode,  u.userStatusID, u.AddedBy, u.AddedDate, u.ModifiedBy, u.ModifiedDate FROM     [User] u Check Grades Match WHERE    u.userID IN            SELECT f.locumID      FROM   dbo.Form f, dbo.FormEmployment emp      WHERE  f.formID  emp.formID      AND    emp.statusID  101      AND    emp.workYN  1      AND    emp.gradeID IN               select gradeID from dbo.ShiftGrade where shiftID  p0                     codepre  pYou can see I am using the IN statement to do this. However, I only want to return a list of Users who can match exactly the same Grades that have been assigned to a Shift. Therefore, if a Shift has been assigned 3 Grades, then I want a List of Users who also have the exact same three Grades to be returned.p  pI apologise for the lengthy post, I just thought it would be better explained this way. Any feedback or help with this would be greatly appreciated.p

Negative 1850 pI have a stored procedure that generates and sends HTML emails to customers using spsenddbmail.  Ive gotten a request to print copies of the ones where I do not have an email address on file, so they can mail them.  My kludge is to substitute in an email address for a mailbox on my exchange server that is set to forward the message to the Faxport of a copier in the MailRoom.  It works, but is extremely cumbersome, and subject to all kinds of delays due to the Faxtransmission.p  pIt seems that since my SQL server is on the domain,  I should be able to route output directly to any printer installed on it from the Stored Procedure, but I have not been able to find any way to send HTML to a printer from a Stored Procedure.p

Negative 1850 pI have a Tkinter GUI which displays a Matplotlib plot Python 2.7.3 with Matplotlib 1.2.0rc2 and lets the user configure certain aspects of the plot. The plots tend to get large, so the figure is wrapped in a scrolling canvas.

Below is a script to demonstrate the effect. Sorry about the length, I couldnt get it any shorter. You can scroll through the plot using the scrollbars, and it can be made smaller and larger using the buttons. However, emwheneverem you scroll, the figure is emreset to its original sizeem.

Negative 1850 pIm sitting here trying to find a way around URLrewriting for my new site. Its going to be a fully AJAXbased site where the URL has no importance in 90  of the URLs.p  pAfter pressing F12 in Chrome and going to Network, I started monitoring the responsiveness as I changed the parameters in .htaccess.p  pI found that when entering an address that the server hadnt seen since restart, it spent 80100ms to process the request wait time. This is running on the localhost. This occured both when changing the dynamic part of the GETrequest idchangeThis and when entering new URLs like idchangeThis.. The next time however, it takes 812ms to process...p  pIf I use code.code to redirect all requests to index.php didnt have an impact.p  pQuestion Would it in a bigger scale matter if I use code[azAZ]code notice no period to make static files like main.css not be rewritten, or is it best to put all files in a static folder and thus loose flexibility and still use code.code to redirect all requests not in the static exception folder. Im thinking speed here.p  pQuestion Can anyone approve my findings Does Apache really cache the requests, so that the first request to a specific URL will take time to processp

Negative 1850 pIm using sqlites fulltextsearch support to store documents that may contain codeampcode, codeltcode and codegtcode characters. I intended to use the snippet function to highlight the matches for an html results page, but I dont see an obvious way to escape the text before injecting the markers. Id rather not escape the text before storing it, because then codeampcode, codeltcode and codegtcode will become tokens.p  pThe simplest workaround I can think of is to escape the pages before storing them, and use a custom tokenizer that would first unescape codeampampcode, codeampltcode and codeampgtcode.p  pHowever... since the default for codesnippetfoocode is to use codeltbgtcode and codeltbgtcode, it really seems like this is a very common use case and Im convinced that there must be a way to handle this without reinventing the wheel in C.

Negative 1850 pI recently installed windows 8.1 preview as a lastditch effort to solve my problem of Visual Studio 2012 being horribly slow. That made it run 100 faster. Unfortunately, my VS 20102012 extension, which is targeted for .NET 4.0 in order to run on VS 2010 AND 2012, will no longer build on Windows 8.1 preview. Several SDK dlls e.g. Microsoft.VisualStudio.Text.Data.dll are not available when targeting .NET 4.0. If I switch to .NET 4.5, they become available to reference. Installing VS 2013 preview did not fix the problem. Any ideas on how to solve this issue are much appreciated.p

Negative 1850 pI wrote a program that searches for a user name on a web site and downloads the their main html page, finds the link to the next page and downloads that and so on. When I run the program the first time the get response for the search works correctly and the get response for downloading all of html pages works correctly. However, when I do a second search the get response fails for the search. I thought that maybe it was the server only allowing so many searches in a time period but it isnt that. When I close my program and run it again everything works fine again. Why does the get response fail on any attempts besides the initial one You cant define a web request as new and their seems to be no way of closing a web request once it gets a response to free up resources.

That was my thinking. Theres got to be another, beter way though... p  h2Summaryh2  pI want to end up with 12 points one for each corner of the shape. p  h2EDITh2  pAfter trying out some erosion and dilation, it seems that the best option would be to slice the contours at certain points and then use bounding boxes around the sliced shapes to get the right boxy corners, and then doing some calculations to rejoin the boxes into one shape. A rather interesting challenge...p  h2EDIT 2h2  pI discovered something that works well I made my own line detection system, that only detects horizontal or vertical lines, and then on a detected linecontour edge, the program draws a black line that extends across the whole image, thus effectively slicing the image at the straight lines of the contours. Once it does that, it gets new contours of the sliced up boxes, draws bounding boxes around the pieces and then uses dilation to close the gaps. So far, it works well on large shapes, but when the shapes are small, it tends to lose a bit of the shape.p

Negative 1850 pI have a working connection between my Chrome sender and the ChromeCast, as in I can properly send and receive messages between the two, but every time a sender connects, it creates a new connection while incrementing what I guess to be a session variable wslocalhost8008sessionx , where x is the number incremented.p  pI would like to know two thingsp  ol lipWhy does it increment the session variable on every connection  Is it by design  Or am I failing to close the connection properly  From what I can see the connection sends a close event by default but I could be wrong.pli lipIf the session is renewed by design, is there a way to detect previous sessions and connect to those if one side is still active pli ol  pbEDITb I understand that the Chrome sender APIs do not support the multiple connection scenario described in the Android TicTacToe demo application, but my purpose for asking is because when this session variable is incremented to a certain point other applications, such as the YouTube Android app, begin to preform irregularly, seemingly because of lag in the WebSocket connection. I would really like to know why this connection is being incremented. From my testing it is purely by design, likely to ensure each client gets a unique connection to the ChromeCast  ie to prevent the multiple controller scenario noted below .p

Negative 1850 pFirst of all, I want to tell you that Im new here and Im from Spain and my english level isnt so good, so please... try to understand me haha. Also, you must know that Im a telematic engineering student and programming is just my favourite hobby. With this info, I just want you to be comprehensive with my question I know that its a rookie question and its worse when Im pretending to create an Android game... But Im learning bit by bit.p  pemPROBLEMemp  pThe problem that I have is the next one. I want to set a .PNG image in my principal activity called activityprincipal. This image has lot of empty space and the background is initially black due to the theme selected at the beginning I guess. Well, this image has some details in black and them merges with the background colour.p  pMy first solution was trying to set the two backgrounds from the XML corresponding code, but rapidly I realized it was impossible to use it twice in a same layout. So I thought that it would be fixed by the next way I set the emandroidbackgroundandroidcolorwhiteem in the XML file and in the .java file I set the other resource to the backgroundp  precodeOverride protected void onCreateBundle savedInstanceState      super.onCreatesavedInstanceState     setContentViewR.layout.activityprincipal      RelativeLayout fondo  RelativeLayout findViewByIdR.layout.activityprincipal     fondo.setBackgroundResourceR.drawable.prototipoestructurapantalla  codepre  pI used to use this structure and never had problems but today, trying to do this, I noticed something strange. Due not to find the error, I put two breakpoints at the lines under setContentView... and debugging, when the cursor reached the last code line fondo.setBack... the variable fondo was null and I think that there is the problem, so when I resume the debugging the app crashes...p  pI hope you can help me. Thank youp

Negative 1850 pI have a jPanel, which contains a number of subpanels that can be dragged around. What I want to do, is to draw lines connecting some of those subpanels together.p  pHowever, while it seems like this should be simple, its proven very frustrating. The best Ive gotten, is to override the paintComponent function in the original jPanel as suchp  precodepanCharDisplay  new javax.swing.JPanel      Override     public void paintComponentGraphics g          super.paintComponentg         paintLinesg       codepre  pAnd then draw the lines as suchp  precodepublic void paintLinesGraphics g      g.setColorColor.BLUE     for Character c  characters          if c.female ampamp c.spouse  null              g.drawLinec.display.getX, c.display.getY, c.spouse.display.getX, c.spouse.display.getY                codepre  pThis works in a sense, in that it does technically draw the lines, in the right place, the right color, and so on, but only if I scroll away from where the line should be, and then scroll back. Whenever I drag a component around it causes weird graphics errors, as it draws only parts of the  line and doesnt erase the ones before. The lines also show up below the subpanels instead of over them, making them hidden a lot of the time.p  pI assume the reason for this is that Im drawing the lines at the wrong time, and need to draw them after drawing the subpanels, and also make sure that they are redrawn every time the panels are dragged around.p  pIs there another place I can put in an override to make the lines show up more consistently Another method I tried, was to make a class that extends JPanel, and try to use that to handle the drawing, but I couldnt get it to work at all.p

Negative 1850 pThe a hrefhttpwww.w3.orgTRCSS21box.htmlcollapsingmargins relnofollowCSS 2.1 specification, section 8.3.1a on collapsing margins statesp  blockquote   pMargins of elements that establish new block formatting contexts such   as floats and elements with overflow other than visible do not   collapse with their inflow children.p blockquote  pIt took me a while to realize that the block formatting context is the context that is established by the parent and applied to the children, so that to make any difference, the float or overflow properties have to be adjusted on the parent element rather than to the children.p  pIn the following code snippet, border heights of adjacent child div elements collapse, so that between any two child div elements there is a vertical spacing of max20px, 20px  20px instead of 20px  20px  40px, and border heights between the first child element and the parent div, and between the last child element and the parent div, are also max20px, 0px  20px instead of 20px  20px  40px, respectively. Note that no collapsing appears in the horizontal direction, just as per the CSS 2.1 spec.p  precodeltdoctype htmlgt lthtmlgt ltheadgt ltmeta charsetutf8gt lttitlegtTestlttitlegt ltstyle typetextcssgt   margin 0 border 0 padding 0  ltstylegt ltheadgt ltbody stylebackground greengt   ltdiv idwrapper stylewidth 400px background black                             overflow hidden  float left gt     ltdiv idbox1 stylemargin 20px height 100px background redgt     ltdivgt     ltdiv idbox2 stylemargin 20px height 100px background bluegt     ltdivgt     ltdiv idbox3 stylemargin 20px height 100px background redgt     ltdivgt     ltdiv idbox4 stylemargin 20px height 100px background bluegt     ltdivgt   ltdivgt ltbodygt lthtmlgt codepre  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comsrwCm.png altCase 1p  pHad the top margin of the red box1 element not collapsed with its parent, such margin would not have pushed the black background down below the margin, and the red box1s margin would be superimposed upon the black background of the parent element. A similar argument applies to the blue box1 element on the bottom.p  pNow, just as the CSS 2.1 spec mentions, if either of the float left or overflow hidden parts of the containing div are commented out, then the top and bottom borders of the parent element in this case it is 0 and the top in this case 10px border of the first child, and the bottom in this case 10px border of the bottom child, are separated, yieling the result shown belowp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comngF1k.png altenter image description herep  pNow, and here comes the questionp  pstrongWhat was the rationale for introducting this rule into CSS Was it just a random decision, or was it motivated by some real, practical example knowing this would also help me remember the rule, other than satisfying my curiosity.strongp  pThanks.p

When should one implement a service From my experience there are some rare cases but I am questioning this because on every phone there are quite a lot of them running and I doubt its just a poor application design.p  pThis is essentially core of my question but following are some of my experiences and thoughts about the subject which can explain my question in more detail.p  pIn all apps that I have developed only one really required a service. It was a background sound recorder and I was using it as Foreground service with notification since I wanted buttons to be able to control it like music players do for example.p  pExcept this I newer really saw a requirement for the constantly running service becausep  pA Intent listeners Manifest registered  BroadcastReceivers are quite a useful feature and using them as you know is usually enough for many usecases for example showing notifications.p  pB If scheduled execution is a must one can subscribe to alarm events.p  pC I know that service in Android is quite different then for example in Windows since in Android services are just a package to organise your code in and have a the system manage the lifetime of the object. Services use the MainThread but its customary to spawn new threads in them.p  pD In the development documentation services are suggested for network communication and background calculations but I dont get why you should not just use AsyncTasks for that. I am a big fan of these and use them extensively for lot of things from downloading data from the internet to doing FFT calculations under time critical conditions.p  pE I get the usefulness of Foreground services but why are people using background services so much excluding the system apps.p  pThose are my thoughts about the SERVICE and I hope someone with more experience will be able to explain these PROS and CONS along with others that I probably missed. p

Negative 1850 pI am creating a new module and in that module I add a form which has a field name codecontentcode in the database.p  pNow when I add a wyswig editor in this form with the field name codecontentcode in the database, the layout of the form in the backend changes completely as compared to default layout.p  pBut when I changed the database field name from codecontentcode to any other name lets say codecontenthtmlcode or codecontenthcode etc etc., the layout of the form now appeared as a default form.p  pThis happens only when I use wyswig editor, and without wyswig if I create simple form it accepts the values in the database under the codecontentcode field name.p  pWhy cant magento accept the codecontentcode as a field name, using wyswig editor.p
Negative 1850 pI have been working on a two player air hockey kind of game for windows RT devices using monogame, Apart from gaming logic I recently integrated sqlite for winRT in my app so that players could be able to save their scoreboard, view recent scores and share them on social networks. But with this Integration I started running into problems.p  pbefore explaining the problem Let me make you aware of my PC and target device architectures.p  pstrongThe machine on which I am developing and testing is Windows 8 pro with 64 bit x64 based processor.strongp  pstrongAnd the target machine is Windows RT 32 bit os, ARM based Processor.strongp  pNow when I set the target platform of my app as ANY CPU and then try deploying my app I get an error which readsp  pstrongError 1   The processor architecture of the project being built Any CPU is not supported by the referenced SDK SQLite.WinRT, Version3.8.2. Please consider changing the targeted processor architecture of your project in visual studio this can be done through the Configuration Manager to one of the architectures supported by the SDK x86, x64, ARM. Pongstrongp  pNow I set the target platform as ARM then again I am in an error which saysp  pstrongError 6   Error  DEP0700  Registration of the app failed. Windows cannot install package da981e371c3c46148c8540485aa9e4a8 because the package requires architecture ARM, but this computer has architecture x64. 0x80073cf3   Pongstrongp  pthen I set the target to x86. This makes the game run normally on my PC but the package installation on target device fails with this option.p  pNow finally I am left with x64 as the target. This also runs well on my system, also the package gets easily installed on target machine. But it just shows me a black screen for longNote that it is not a crash.p  pI know I might be doing silly somewhere. But I am stuck on this from a long time.p  pIts a long note, But its only so that I could make you well aware with my problem.p  pPlease provide the answer to the problem. p  pYour Suggestions are always appreciated  Thanks.p

Negative 1850 pIm working on a legacy code Spring 2.5.x, Java 1.5, where controller passes Http Servlet Request to view like thisp  precode     public ModelAndView handleRequestHttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response throws Exception           Map attributes  new HashMap         attributes.puthttpRequest, request         return new ModelAndViewpathtopage.jsp, attributes       codepre  pHowever what happens is that httpRequest attribute does indeed exist in the JSP Page context, but it contains current request JSP page and not the original controller. The passed request is being used to extract some information from the URL. It appears that I can get around that problem by using a bunch of javax.servlet.forward. attributes. This however puzzles me as it is pretty simple thing and Id be happy to get it to work anyways or at least know exactly why it doesnt work now. Anybody has any ideasp

Negative 1850 pIve created a custom listview with an image on the left and two lines of text on the right. It works fine and I can have a default image display.

Ive posted some code snippets below to show whats already there. Its probably something stupid but Im quite new to Android Dev so Im not familiar enough to realise whats going wrong.

Negative 1850 pOkay, so, Im back to writing firmware different job, now in Biotech, and this company uses the Keil uVision4 IDE.p  pMy current task is implementing a USB HID stack into an existing RTOS that was created inhouse. Hardware is an STM32L152ZD, with external EEPROM, which I will need to read from. Current hardware platform is the STM32L152DEVAL board.p  pI was seemingly able to successfully implement the stack using some examples from STM, and it looked like I had integrated the stack into the RTOS. With this, I was using a feature report to tell the hardware to do something, which the board would indicate a successful receipt of the FR with blinking lights. Then, strange things started happening. The LEDs on the eval board would all light up, and never come off. When I tried to debug the code through uVision, it would give me the following dialog boxerror message Debugger  CortexM Error Internal Command Errorp  pSo, after going through and erasing program memory, I attempted numerous reuploads, with similar result. I then went back and uploaded the STM USB HID firmware, which worked fine, reassuring me I hadnt somehow fried the dev board. Once I knew the board worked, I tried rebuilding and uploading the RTOS w USB firmware, and, what do you know, it worked, again With this, I breathed a sigh of relief... which was to be short lived.p  pI now took on the task of reading from EEPROM, editing the appropriate files in the USB stack to accomplish this. After finishing what I believed to be the right code, I rebuild the firmware and uploaded. Everything looked fine. It was recognized as a USB device in Windows and would respond to a python script I had written to receive the data. The weird thing was, the data the device was responding with was still from the test firmware. So, I went back and put in some LED flashes during OS initialization, and what do you know, no flashes. It was still running the modified STM firmware.p  pIve erased the chip a number of times, and tried to upload the RTOS wUSB, then debug, but Im still running into the same issue Debug doesnt work, and it looks like its uploading some different firmware.p  pHas anyone else had this issue, and if so, what am I doing wrongp  pI should also mention that Im using the Eval boards built in STLink utility, rather than the Keil ULINK2 which is currently collecting dust on my desk.p

Negative 1850 pI have a set of points, each with an x and y coordinates.

But this solution isnt Onlogn since checking each point will take time proportional to n and the comparisons for each point would take time proportional to 2n. Im not sure where logn would come from without using a divideandconquer approach.p  pFor some reason, I cant come up with a solution. Any help would be appreciated.p

Negative 1850 pIm currently designing an application using the Twisted framework, and Ive hit a bit of a roadblock in my planning.p  h2Formal Description of the Problemh2  pMy application has the following constraintsp  ol liData arrive inorder, but asynchronously.  I cannot know when the next piece of my data will arriveli liThe order in which data arrive must be preserved throughout the lifespan of the application process.li liAdditional strongasynchronousstrong operations must be mapped onto this stream of data.li ol  pThe description of my problem may remind people of the Functional Reactive Programming FRP paradigm, and thats a fair comparison.  In fact, I think my problem is welldescribed in those terms and my question can be pretty accurately summarized thusly  How can I leverage Twisted in such a way as to reason in terms of data streamsp  pMore concretely, this is what I stronghavestrong figured outp  ol liA datum arrives and is unpacked into an instance of a custom class, henceforth referred to as datum instanceli liThe newlyarrived datum instance is appended to a codecollections.dequecode object, encapsulated by a custom codeStreamcode class.li lipThe codeStreamcode class exposes methods such as codeStream.mapcode that apply nonblocking computations strongasynchronouslystrong top  ol liAll elements already present in the codeStreamcode instances deque.li liAll future elements, as they arrive.li olli lipResults of the operations performed in item 3 are appended to a strongnewstrong codeStreamcode object.  This is because its important to preserve the original data, as it will often be necessary to map several callables to a given stream.pli ol  pAt the risk of beating a dead horse, I want to insist upon the fact that the computations being mapped to a codeStreamcode instance are expected to return instances of codeDeferredcode.p  h2The Questionh2  pIncidentally, this precisely where Im stuck  I can implement items 1, 2 amp 3 quite trivially, but Im struggling with how to handle populating the results codeStreamcode.  The difficulty stems from the fact that I have no guarantees of stream length, so its completely possible for data to arrive while Im waiting for some asynchronous operations to complete.  Its also entirely possible for async operation emOsubisubem to complete after emOsubi  nsubem, so I cant just add codedeque.appendcode as a callback.p  pSo how should I approach this problem  Is there some nifty, hidden feature of Twisted I have yet to discover  Do any twistyfingered developers have any ideas or patterns I could applyp

Negative 1850 pSo Ive been working on this project of mine for the past two weeks and Ive not made any headway with this. My issue isnt with parsing the XML file to begin with, but rather what to do with it afterwards. So Ive made programs with SAX, StAX and DOM parsers in which I take a very large XML file and then print out the elements and their values in order. However, the XML Im dealing with is large so using DOM is inefficient of course. Another problem I have however is that the xml file has 40,000 entries of information and its structure is complicated.

What I need to be able to do with my program is allow the user to select what information he wants from the 40,000 entry, and then return the information in the form of an excel sheet. So if I only wanted say the version number and name for all 40,000 entries, itll return just those values into excel. Currently Ive made a program that loops through using StAX and returns all the elements and values through print onto console. How would I go about creating a data structure, such as a tree or something, that would then allow me to do what it is that I want to do i.e. traverse through that data and return only the data Im seeking. p  pThis is what Ive done so far in terms of looping through my document and returning the information in order for the 40,000 entriesp  precodepublic class xmlRead       private static XMLStreamReader reader      public xmlRead          try              InputStream file  new FileInputStreamUsersKevlarDropboxPhDJavaHMDBtestOutput.xml             XMLInputFactory inputFactory  XMLInputFactory.newInstance              reader  inputFactory.createXMLStreamReaderfile              assertreader.getEventType  XMLEvent.STARTDOCUMENT                catch XMLStreamException e             System.err.printlnXMLStreamException    e.getMessage             catch FactoryConfigurationError e             System.err.printlnFactoryConfigurationError    e.getMessage             catch FileNotFoundException e             System.err.printlnFileNotFoundException    e.getMessage                     public void metaboliteInfo throws XMLStreamException          whilereader.hasNext          int event  reader.getEventType          ifevent  XMLStreamConstants.STARTELEMENT ampamp reader.getLocalName  metabolite              System.out.printlnNew   reader.getLocalName                  mainElementsreader                   else ifevent  XMLStreamConstants.ENDDOCUMENT             System.out.printlnend of document             break                    else          reader.next                              reader.close            public void mainElementsXMLStreamReader reader throws XMLStreamException              int level  1              do                  int event  reader.next                  ifevent  XMLStreamConstants.STARTELEMENT                      System.out.printlnElement   reader.getLocalName                     level                      iflevel  2                         subElementsreader                         level                                                        else ifevent  XMLStreamConstants.CHARACTERS ampamp reader.isWhiteSpace                     System.out.printlnreader.getText                                   else ifevent  XMLStreamConstants.ENDELEMENT                     level                               whilelevel gt 0          reader.close            private void subElementsXMLStreamReader reader throws XMLStreamException           int level  1          do              int event  reader.next              ifevent  XMLStreamConstants.STARTELEMENT                  System.out.printlnSub element   reader.getLocalName                 level                  iflevel  2                     subElementsreader                     level                                            else ifevent  XMLStreamConstants.CHARACTERS ampamp reader.isWhiteSpace                 System.out.printlnreader.getText                           else ifevent  XMLStreamConstants.ENDELEMENT                 level                       whilelevel gt 0      reader.close        public void findElementsXMLStreamReader reader, String element throws XMLStreamException              int level  1              do                  int event  reader.next                  ifevent  XMLStreamConstants.STARTELEMENT                      ifreader.getLocalName  element                         System.out.printlnreader.getLocalName                                          level                      iflevel  2                         subElementsreader                         level                                                        else ifevent  XMLStreamConstants.CHARACTERS ampamp reader.isWhiteSpace                     System.out.printlnreader.getText                                   else ifevent  XMLStreamConstants.ENDELEMENT                     level                               whilelevel gt 0          reader.close             public static void mainString[] args throws XMLStreamException          xmlRead test  new xmlRead         test.metaboliteInfo         codepre  pI should probably note here too that Im not actually a programmer.

Negative 1850 pI use strongliferay 6.1.2strong bundled with jboss, integrated with strongCAS for authenticationstrong. Now I want to integrate strongLDAP for user registrationstrong as well. Just the registration is to be done in liferay and to be exported to LDAP and authentication using CAS. The problem I am facing is that when we register in liferay, the user gets exported to LDAP, but not his password. The password will get exported to LDAP only if we login using the liferay login portlet. This is actually not allowed and login should be only via CAS to LDAP. Now my idea is that the password should get saved into LDAP at the time of registration itself or any similar workarounds. I have no idea how to accomplish this. Please ask if any additional information is needed.p  precodelogin.create.account.allow.custom.passwordtrue passwords.default.policy.change.requiredfalse ldap.auth.methodbind codepre  pThese are the extra parameters I tried. p

Negative 1850 pIm fairly new to Matlab so any help would be appreciated.p  pIm trying to write a function using simple logic operators to create a number of 2D scatter graphs, the problem Ive been having is that I cannot work out how to use a input from the user the number of figures to actually create that number of figures. p  pedit Just for the sake of clarity Im plotting multiple sets of data ie columns on each figure but the important bit is that there will be multiple figures as the user specifies how many figures they want, this is the bit I cannot understand. I understand how to use hold on to plot more than one graph on each figure but how do I vary the number of figures depending on the input of the userp  pThe user inputs are a matrix with dimensions 4000x30 this will remain constant for my use and the number of figures this will change from 130 to plot from this data set. Each column represents a different sensor so the columns represent 1 set of data each.p  pThe simpler the answer the better as Im not a very experienced coder.p  pThanks GibGibp

In this event I make a couple of calls to Meteor methods and finally a server side Iron Router codegorenderpdfcode method.  In these Meteor methods I use codefscode node.js top  blockquote   p1 check if the codeusernamecode directory exists, and if it doesnt I   create it.p      p2 create the pdffile.pdf filep blockquote  pThen in the server side Iron Router codegorenderpdfcode route, again using codefscode node.js to p  blockquote   p3 read the created pdffile.pdf and p      p4 finally render it to the browserp blockquote  pThe problem is in step 1, when creating the codeusernamecode directory, Meteor server restarts.  In step 2, again Meteor server restarts.  p  blockquote   pBut most importantly, the first time my code runs, and the directory   does not exist step 1, I get an error.p blockquote  pI can then call the button event again, this time after the directory has been created, and the pdf is rendered fine.p  pThe error looks like sop  precodeError ENOENT, no such file or directory Usersmynamemeteormeteorapplicationprivatefilesusersusernamepdffile.pdf at Object.fs.openSync fs.js43818 at Object.fs.readFileSync fs.js28915 at [object Object].Router.route.name meteorapplicationbothroutes.js22517 at boundNext packagesironmiddlewarestacklibmiddlewarestack.js2511 at runWithEnvironment packagesmeteordynamicsnodejs.js1081 at packagesmeteordynamicsnodejs.js1211 at [object Object].urlencodedParser Usersmyname.meteorpackagesironrouter.1.0.7.15dqor4osweb.browserweb.cordovanpmnodemodulesbodyparserlibtypesurlencoded.js7236 at packagesironrouterlibrouter.js2771 at [object Object]..extend.withValue packagesmeteordynamicsnodejs.js561 at [object Object].hookWithOptions packagesironrouterlibrouter.js2761 codepre  pIts probably that when I get to the point step 4 of trying to render the file, it either doesnt exist yet or the application is restarting.  The next time I try the application has already restarted and files exist.p  blockquote   pI was under the impression that the codeprivatecode directory provides a   place to handle files that do not affect the execution of the   application  To me this means, at runtime I can add whatever I want without the application restarting.p blockquote  h2Little historyh2  pAt first I used the codeservercode directory with a code.foldernamecode subdirectory. This worked as when I added folder and files the application didnt restart.  The downside is when I deployed Meteor using the great Meteorup package mup, the deployment bundle ignored these files unless I added a code.jscode file somewhere inside.  And further, if I created the hidden folder structure on my EC2 instance, the deployment would remove the directory.  p  pSo using codeprivatecode folder solved this issue, or so I thought.  The folder structure and assets deployed.  But the downside to this approach is when I add assets to it, it seems to restart  codeeven though I though this wasnt something that was suppose to happencode.p  h2Questionh2  pHow can I add assets in the form of directories and files under the codeprivatecode directory without the Meteor application restarting  If this cant be done, how can I add assets emanywhereem only server side without the application restartingp  h2Please noteh2  pWhen I deploy to production, Id like some of the folder structure to stay in place, for examplep  precodeprivatefilesusers codepre  pshould say there, while the p  precodeusername  codepre  pdirectory can be dynamic.  I only mention this because Ive read if you do a code.directorynamecode, Meteor ignores the folder and its contents.  But this includes deployments as well.p  h2What I really needh2  pA server side only folder that gets included in the deployment bundle, and when I add stuff to it at runtime, doesnt restart my application...p  blockquote   pEither a way to include code.hiddenfoldercode in my codemupcode deployment   bundle or have the codeprivatecode folder not restart every time I add   codestuffcode to it at runtime.p blockquote

This is not SOs concern, but Id love to get an answer on this...p  hr  pThe Mule ESB project explains its a hrefhttpwww.mulesoft.comresourcesesbmuleesbbestchoicespringintegration relnofollowdifference to Spring Integrationa on its website. However, regarding a hrefhttpdublincore.orgdocumentsdcmitermstermsdate relnofollowdcterms.datea code20120719T18430300code of the document, the text might be outdated.p  pThe main points of the quoted paragraph arep  ul liSpring Integration takes [...] an applicationcentric approach to integration.li liRather than implement a shared bus, [...] Spring Integration is aimed at providing just a little ESBstyle integration to specific applications.li liSpring Integration is best suited to situations where a small number of components must be integrated, usually internally.li li[Spring Integration has a] very small number of supported transports and transformers available.li li[The] scope of Spring Integration is deliberately limited to smallscale integration within the Spring Portfolio context.li ul  pAre these points still valid Does any more detailed and, if so, uptodate comparison existp  blockquote   pMule ESB vs. Spring Integrationp      pRecently, a new component called Spring Integration was added to the Spring Portfolio, which allows ESBlike functionalities and EIPs to be created and managed within the Spring Framework.  Spring Integration takes what is known as an applicationcentric approach to integration.br   Rather than implement a shared bus, which allows all integration and messaging between components and systems to be managed, administered, and configured centrally, Spring Integration is aimed at providing just a little ESBstyle integration to specific applications by providing frameworks for implementing common EIPs such as a message bus and simple routing.   Due to its limited scope, Spring Integration is best suited to situations where a small number of components must be integrated, usually internally, and the infrastructure in question is made up of a large number of other Spring components.  For anything more complicated, the lack of a common bus, coupled with the very small number of supported transports and transformers available for the young project makes Spring Integration unsuited for the task.br   The advantage of using Mule ESB to handle integration in a Spring environment is that Mule ESB is not simply an ESB  it is an integration platform.  Whereas the scope of Spring Integration is deliberately limited to smallscale integration within the Spring Portfolio context, Mules intentionally modular architecture allows teams to quickly deliver the lightest possible integration solution for any scenario, from simple point to point integration to complicated SOA, cloud and partner ecosystem scenarios. p blockquote

Negative 1850 pI have to implement a token based authentication.p  pUsers have a username and a password. I use the SHA512 method to encrypt the password before inserting it into the database. For retrieving data from the server, making queries and other simple actions, I need to know who is asking for the data and if this person is authenticated. I want to use a token. During the registration the server creates a token for the user and saves it in the Person table into the database, with username and encrypted password. Now, when a user wants to get some data from the server, he can use the token.p  pIs there a way in which the server can understand who the user is using token, or do I need to pass the username too How can I know when the token expires without adding a field in the Person tablep  pIm not sure I have understand the proper use of a token, and I have no idea on how implement it.

Negative 1850 pUPDATED  Okay, Thanks to OneSneakyMofos Help below, I have managed to use ajax to call a submit.php form and have it return for example an echo statement. My problem is that none of my post values are being carried over, for example if my start my php script with if issetPOST[pizzacrustformid]  the javascript will return blank, also when I do a vardumpPOST, Nothing is being saved into it which means the data is not being carried over, the php script is just being called. Please let me know if there is something I need to do in order to get the POST information to get carried over from the form as it would with a  lt Submit  Button traditionally.

Negative 1850 pIm not sure if what Im looking for is a plugin or color scheme. But what I would like to have are horizontal lines dividing function definitions in codegeanycode.

I checked in the R file but I couldnt find it. I checked in every file. Nowhere to find. The answer I get from Wiley customer support wasp  pPlease reference a hrefhttpdeveloper.android.comreferenceandroidwidgetRemoteViews.html relnofollowhttpdeveloper.android.comreferenceandroidwidgetRemoteViews.htmla  setOnClickPendingIntentint viewId, PendingIntent pendingIntent Equivalent to calling setOnClickListenerandroid.view.View.OnClickListener to launch the provided PendingIntent. When setting the onclick action of items within collections eg. ListView, StackView etc., this method will not work. Instead, use link RemoteViewssetPendingIntentTemplateint, PendingIntent in conjunction with RemoteViewssetOnClickFillInIntentint, Intent. Parameters viewId     The id of the view that will trigger the PendingIntent when clicked pendingIntent     The PendingIntent to send when user clicks .p  pA dummy doesnt understand all that things. p  pIs it a typo or did I did something wrongp  pI didnt write the whole code.

Negative 1850 pIm currently trying to create a couple of wrapper classes for a MySQL database. Basically, my goal is to eliminate the need to write any SQL at all and keep it all in PHP. I know that at scale this may not be a good solution, but its good for simple setups like the one Im working on now p  pI want to be able to hook this code up to any MySQL table and automatically generate functions that handle CRUD commands. For example, I have about 20 columns in a table called Users, and I want 4 functions for each column Create, Read, Update, and Delete. I wont actually need ALL of them, but this is supposed to be just a layer that I then build my real PHP apps off of.p  pI am trying to automate these classes Im making because its extremely repetitive and it should be very simple to automate the generation.p  pTo illustrate, where name is a column in the Users tablep  precodefunction createNamename       ifstmt  thisgtdbgtprepareINSERT INTO  . thisgttable .         name values  . name .              stmt gt execute            stmt gt fetch            stmt gt close          else          echo error  . mysqlierrorthisgtdb       codepre  pThis could be generalized top  precodefunction createcolumnTitledesiredValue       ifstmt  thisgtdbgtprepareINSERT INTO  .                  thisgttable . columnTitle values  . desiredValue .           stmt gt execute         stmt gt fetch         stmt gt close          else          echo error  . mysqlierrorthisgtdb       codepre  pWhere columnTitle is the name of the column in question, and desiredValue is what you want the columns value to be for that entry.p  pSo literally every single CREATE function is going to be exactly the same, except the function name and parameter name will be equal to the name of the table column in question. I feel as though I should be able to get all the columns in a database and automatically change the variable and function names instead of creating 80 boilerplate functions 4 for each column and then doing findreplace a million times.p  pAny ideasp  pId like to make it work on any database tables so that I could put it on github for anyone to use. So basically the flow would gop  ul ligrab all tables in a database li lifor each table  ul ligrab all columns in table   ul ligenerate CREATE functions for all columns  li ligenerate READ functions for all columns li ligenerate UPDATE functions for all columns li ligenerate DELETE functions for all columnsli ulli ulli ul

But I would prefer the menu items appear on one line.p  pHow can I do this  Is it possible to change the datatarget attribute in the button tag so that datatarget points to another set of ltligt elements that do not have ltbrgt elementsp  pI suppose another way would be to use JavaScript to change the innerHTML property of the ltligt elements when the screen size is small.p  pThanks for your helpp  precode.navbarnav li      displayinlineblock     liststyletypenone     textaligncenter   ltnav classnavbar navbarinversegt ltdiv classcontainerfluidgt ltdiv classnavbarheadergt ltbutton typebutton classnavbartoggle datatogglecollapse datatargetmyNavbargt ltspan classiconbargtltspangt ltspan classiconbargtltspangt ltspan classiconbargtltspangt ltbuttongt  lta classnavbarbrand hrefgtltagt ltdivgt   ltdiv classcollapse navbarcollapse idmyNavbargt ltul classnav navbarnavgt     ltligtlta hrefgtHomeltagtltligt     ltligtlta hrefgtWhiteltbr gtTeasltagtltligt     ltligtlta hrefgtGreenltbr gtTeasltagtltligt     ltligtlta hrefgtOolongltbr gtTeasltagtltligt     ltligtlta hrefgtBlackltbr gtTeasltagtltligt     ltligtlta hrefgtHerballtbr gtTeasltagtltligt     ltligtlta hrefgtBloomingltbr gtTeasltagtltligt     ltligtlta hrefgtMateltbr gtTeasltagtltligt ltulgt ltdivgt codepre
Negative 1850 pI have a content type of strongresourcestrong that has five different resource types video, article, book, etc.. Each of these resources has a main image field fieldimage. If the user doesnt provide an image I want to fallback to a default image. However, I would like the default image to be based on the type of resource video, article, book, etc.. Is there a module or solution to do this within the Drupal UI I need the image to be attached to the content type not hard coded in templates so that it displays properly on detail, list, and other view pages.p  pstrongExpected Functionalitystrongp  ul liResource fieldtype  article fieldimage  defaultarticle.jpgli liResource fieldtype  book fieldimage  defaultbook.jpgli liResource fieldtype  video fieldimage  defaultvideo.jpg li ul  pstrongWhat Ive triedstrongp  pemGoogleem Ive tried but failed to find anything that would make this possible. I understand by default Drupal allows only one default image per content type. I could make a new content type for each of my five types, but that seems unnecessary and clunky. p  pemHard codeem I have a template for my resource detail page where Ive hard coded the relevant default image to show if there is no image present, but this doesnt scale well as I have many views resource list, related resources, etc. where I am displaying resource images.p  pemConditional Fieldsem Ive tried the module Field Dependencies e.g., when fieldtype  x, set fieldimage  y, but it doesnt appear to work with files.p  pThanksp

Negative 1850 pIm wondering whats the most efficient way of repainting in my case, and how to go about it.p  pIve got a codeJFramecode, containing a codeJPanelcode. This codeJPanelcode contains a some AWT graphics. Some of these graphics are fixed, they dont move. Some other graphics on top of the fixed graphics in this panel do move. The layout is updated every 3 seconds. The fixed graphics require quite a bit of math to draw, so I probably dont want to repaint all graphics, but only the moving ones. p  pThis is the possibilities I came up withp  ol liTo put the fixed graphics and the moving graphics in two separate panels and only repaint one panel, which are layed over each other.li liTo add two different codeGraphicscode objects to the panel one for fixed graphics and one for the moving and only repaint one graphics object. is this even possibleli liPerhaps some other way I dont knowli ol
