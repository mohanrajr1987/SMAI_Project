Positive 359 pI want to pull ad data campaigns, ad sets, amp metrics like clicksimpressionsctr from Facebook using their API and put it into a database.  Facebooks documentation says I need to create an app on their site in order to access the API, but that doesnt seem right.  Im not trying to create an app for my fb page, just want to extract data.  p  pMy first choice was to use an ODBC driver fromp  precodelta hrefhttpcdn.cdata.comhelpRBAodbcpgallviews.htmgtCDataltagt codepre  p, which does allowed me to successfully pull data from AdAccounts but threw an error when trying to get AdSets or AdStatisticsp  blockquote   pOAuthException Code 10 You do not have sufficient permissions to perform this action.  p blockquote  pI made sure to add in a codetargetactmyAdAccountIdcode parameter to the query, as per their documentation, but it didnt help.  I figured this meant I didnt configure the driver properly, so maybe Id have better luck just coding up a solution in python or php.p  pNext, I tried to run similar API calls using the Graph API Explorer and got the same error message.  I created an access token that had all the extended permissions and then made a request to p  blockquote   pGET v2.4actmyAdAccountIdadcampaigns. p blockquote  pThis gave me the exact same OAuthException Code 10 error that I was getting through the ODBC Driver.  p  pCan someone confirm whether its possible to pull data from the API without building an app  If so, what permissions do I need to enable for my account  Im already an Ad Account Admin in the Ads Manager, and couldnt find anywhere else to set permissions. p  pThanksp
Positive 359 pI have an C application linux which will later be installed to opt.p  pInside this application i need to save some passwords stored in a database file which needs to be placed also inside optfooApp.p  pThe problem is that this file needs to be changed sometimes like on new user add but you know we not have write permissions inside opt so only root can do that.p  pMy idea was to add a new system group called fooApp, and change the group of this application  process to it so it can write into optfooAppp  pThe thing is only root can change the group of files because i was trying strongsetpgid2strong but it always return 1.p  pSuccessfully i got the group id with stronggetpgid2strong but i think it does not help me now.p  pI really want to write this database file as root into optfooApp so no one can delete it.p  pBut also i need to be able to modify it.p  p.p  p[EDIT] I really dont know why i got this stupid negative vote because this is not a stupid question so i saw some people have this problem.p  pAnd the solution was so simple You just need to set the SUIDBit on the executable application mine was fooApp and magically it can create files on the root filesystem for example inside opt owned by itself and locked for all other ones.p  pSee a hrefhttpsen.wikipedia.orgwikiSetuid relnofollowhttpsen.wikipedia.orgwikiSetuidap
Positive 359 pIn the security system of Windows, a user can belong to many groups, and a group can contain other groups.  What are the rules for how conflicting permissions get resolved in Windowsp  pFor instance, say a user is in Group A and also in Group B.  Group A has Deny Read on a file while Group B has Allow Read.  Can the user read the filep  pWhat if the user itself has been denied the rights to read something, but its in a group where that permission was explicitly allowedp  pWhile I know how to get the permissions for a particular FileSystem resource via the AccessRules and the rights they expose, since the rules target a specific IdentityReference which could be a user or a group, I have seen conflicts and am trying to determine the logic to figure out who wins.p  p...or is there a known way to say Get me all rights for this user, also taking into consideration any memberships and let the system worry about it Im surprised I havent found exactly that already.

Positive 359 pI would like users of my application to be able to create Roles dynamically and assign permissions to this roles. Therefor Roles model is not going to be hardcoded. Though, Permissions, as far as I understand do have to be hardcoded because Im going to hardcode theirs checks in application logicp  pThe best way I see is to keep Roles in database and create them on the fly and assign  unassign permissions. And Permissions should be kept in an array or hash, or associative array and should be changed only by developer and require server restart.p  pEverything seems to be fine, but I would like to read about some best practices of permission based authorization I can find a lot about Rolebased authorization, not Permission based and about any possible disadvantages.p  pAlso, I cant yet find the best way to manage levels of permissions. For example, I have permissions called Act As Admin, Manage Users, CreateReadUpdateDelete Userp  pI would like to let Role with permission of Act As Admin to do everything manager users, CRUD users etc. Role with permission of Manage Users  automatically can CRUD users. This approach is better because it wont require one to check a lot of OR conditions can act as adminm, or can manage users, or can CRUD user...p  pBut how should I keep Permissions hash array etc in memory for this purposesp  pI suppose, this question is language  framework  etc agnostic so I wont add such tagsp

Positive 359 pIm trying to access another document root instead of varwwwhtml  but I get permission denied. p  pI have changed the DocumentRoot to point to the new folder. p  precodeltVirtualHost 80gt          The ServerName directive sets the request scheme, hostname and port that          the server uses to identify itself. This is used when creating          redirection URLs. In the context of virtual hosts, the ServerName          specifies what hostname must appear in the requests Host header to          match this virtual host. For the default virtual host this file this          value is not decisive as it is used as a last resort host regardless.          However, you must set it for any further virtual host explicitly.

Positive 359 pI have a repository on github with preset wordpress with a few plugins. I cloned it into my mamp folder to start working on a new project. However something is wrong with the file permissions. During WordPress installation wp could not create wpconfig file, so I had to create it manually and when saving it requested an admin password to do so. If I want to update a plugin while in the admin area of this new wordpress site it requires ftp credentials, while if I go to another site in the same mamp folder I can click update and the plugin is updated. I checked the permissions for both wordpress site folders and they are 755. My question is what could trigger such behavior with permissions and how can it be prevented in the futurep

Positive 359 pI am trying to create a filelevel backup solution using Cobian 11 on a Server 2008 R2 not a dc. I have some secured folders which are shared from the local machine to others on the network, and I am unable to back up those folders while accessing them locally. p  pIm running the backup as a service under a domain user account, which is a member of the local backup operators group. I thought backup operators were supposed to be able to access all files regardless of permissions. However, when I add the same account to other groups, it gains access to files, which are permitted for those groups. p  pI should also add that the backup does capture other files in other folders. I made a test folder, and I tried to back it up with different sets of permissions. By default, it allowed the local users group to access the files. With that permission, the backup operator was able to back up the test files. However, when I took that permission away, it failed.p  pEverything Ive read said backup operators are supposed to have access to all files regardless of permissions. So, Ill have to troubleshoot this problem. Is anyone aware of circumstances under which backup operators cannot access local filesp

Positive 359 pI am building a Facebook app which posts Actions to users Activity Streams. This works fine using an emAppem Access Token.

Negative 359 pI am trying to use some socket network programming in C. I am trying to send the text Hello World to a server using the C send function.

Negative 359 pAt work, we have migrated from Windows XP to Windows Vista.  After the migration, some of my unit tests, using nUnit, started to randomly fail with the System.UnauthorizedAccessException being thrown.  The failing tests each involve writing files used for tests stored as embedded resources in the test DLL to the current directory, running the tests, then deleting them, typically in the setupteardown or the fixture setupteardown, in rapid succession.  I do this so that my tests are agnostic to the location on each developers drive that they are ran from and not worrying about relative file paths.p  pWhile troubleshooting this, I found that it related to the creation and deletion of the files.  On deletion, each delete follows the patternp  precodeif File.Existspath   File.Deletepath  codepre  pWhen I surround this with a trycatch block and breakpoint on the catch if the exception was thrown, the file would already be deleted from the disk.  For the failures of file creation, usually using XmlWriter or StreamWriter, each are specified to overwrite the file if it exists.p  pOdd thing is, while investigating, I created this C program that seems to recreate the exceptionp  precodeclass Program      static void Mainstring[] args              int i  0         try                                    while true                              System.IO.TextWriter writer  new System.IO.StreamWriterfile.txt                 i                 System.Console.Out.WriteLinei                 writer.Writei                 writer.Close                 System.IO.File.Deletefile.txt                               catch System.UnauthorizedAccessException ex                      System.Console.Out.WriteLineBoom at   i.ToString                 codepre  pOn one of our machines that still has XP on it, it will keep iterating into the hundreds of thousands without excepting until I kill it.  On any of our Vista machines, it will print Boom anywhere between 150 and 500 iterations.p  pSince I do not have access to a Vista machine outside of work, I cant determine whether this particular quirk is because of my employers security configuration of Vista or Vista itself.p  pSuffice to say, I am quite stumped.p  pEDITp  pI would like to thank everyone for their responses.

Negative 359 pIn the tif format, when you add EXIF meta data it creates an new IFD tifdirecory and stores the exif metadata as fields. So when parsing a tif file with a single image and exif data is easy. But you can get multipart tiffs, where a tif can contain more then one image, the question is can each of these images have EXIF data  Does this create a new IFD for each pictures metadata p  pWhat is is the arrangement of the IFDs thenp  pThe tif specification doesnt go into any detail, I know that when a single image tif file has EXIF data there is an offset field to the EXIF data, so I can jump to that location and do the parsing myself, but the Java Sanselan library gives me easy access to the EXIF IFD and fields, but emifem it is possible to multiple EXIF IFDs one for each image then the library doesnt tell me to which image the data belongs. p  pIf you cannot have more then 1 EXIF IFD in a multipart tif file, then itll be trivial In other words  Do I need to go to the effort of manually parsing the exif data Because I only need to do this emifem you can attach EXIF data to each image inside a multipart tif. p  pOr does anyone know of a good Linux app that allows me to add EXIF data to tif files so I can figure it out for myselfp

Negative 359 pCurrently Im building an application using latest Prism for Silverlight 4. Ive a module and in that module Ive two views with view models. Also Ive a module view with two regions for each view. In module initialization Im registering my views and view models in Unity container and also register views with corresponding regions. The problem is that views should display something similar to tabledetail information  first view shows available entities ans the second view shows detail of selected entity.p  pI need a way how to pass them initial selected entity. Newly created first view doesnt have any selected entity and newly created second view doesnt show any details.p  pCurrently Im doing that this way In module I create two view models and register them as instances in Unity container and then I register views as types for corresponding regions. Each view subscribes to EntitySelectedEvent from EventAggregator. Module initializer publish this event after initialization and this way two views are selecting the same entity.p  pI know this looks ugly  I tried publishing this event from one of view models but the problems is that EventAggregator in Prism doesnt support durable subscribers  this means that if the second view model didnt subscribe to event before the first view model fired it, it wont receive and event. I know this is a normal behavior of EventAggregator, but Im looking for a solution when view models can fire events without depending on initialization order of them  that is the first model can fire event before the second model was created and the second model will receive this queued event after subscribing to it.p  pAre there any other messaging implementations for WPFSL which do support such behavior or using a mediator in my example its a module itself isnt such a bad idea after all One big problem with mediator is that models must be created right away in initialize and they cant be registered as types in container because this leads again to missing subscribers.p

Negative 359 pHelpp  pIm working on a project where, after creating some nice code for creating polygons and attaching mouse events to them, the addition of KML layers mainly placemarkers results in uncooperative behaviour between the placeholders of the KML layer and the generated polygons.p  pIf I create the polygons first and set the KML file afterwards, clicking on the placemarkers brings up the infowindow  as expected.  However, mouseovers on the polygons below yield no result, whereas before they get highlighted and are clickable which they arent.p  pSetting the KML layer to null doesnt help either.  The placemarkers disappear, but my polygons arent registering.p  pWhen I first call the KML with placemarkers, the polygon layer called later goes on top of the placemarkers.  The polygons are opaque, so you can see the placemarkers like you could through a window, but you cant click or interact with the placemarkers.p  pSetting the polygons to null results in the same behaviour as before.  Placeholders still cannot be clicked on.p  pHelp  I couldnt find a zIndex reference for the KML layer code, and Im hoping thats all it is.  I read somewhere else  and imagine this to be true  that the KML and usergernated content layers are conflicting with one another  the latter one thats put on the map takes focus, captures events, etc.  I wouldve thought that it wouldnt matter, in the same way that you can have divs on top of other divs, especially if you use indexing.p

Negative 359 pI need to understand how does WCF works when sending a message. Does WCF serialize everything before sending itp  pMy other question is which will be the benefit of using Streaming Is it better for bigger messages, lets say between 1Mb to 2Mb Can I send a complex object serialized, and then be able to deserialize it in the other side easily after streaming by complex object I mean a List of images that can be dynamic, or do I need to format it using something like XMLp  pThe main issue here is that I dont know if when using WFC streaming, I need to serialize the message first before sending it... isnt WFC supposed to serialize everything before sending itp  pI know is very general, but I need to clarify these concepts.p  pCheersp

Negative 359 pIm working on a project in which we will need to determine certain types of statuses for a large body of people, stored in a database.  The business rules for determining these statuses are fairly complex and may change.p  pFor example, p  precodeif a person is part of group X  and if they have attribute O has either attribute P or attribute Q,  or if they dont have attribute O has attribute P but not Q, and dont have attribute R,  and arent part of group Y unless they also are part of group Z,  then status A is true.  codepre  pMultiply by several dozen statuses and possibly hundreds of groups and attributes.  The people, groups, and attributes are all in the database.p  pThough this will be consumed by a Java app, we also want to be able to run reports directly against the database, so it would be best if the set of computed statuses were available at at the data level.p  pOur current design plan, then, is to have a table or view that consists of a set of boolean flags hasStatusA hasStatusB hasStatusC for each person.  This way, if I want to query for everyone who has status C, I dont have to know all of the rules for computing status C I just check the flag.p  pNote that, in real life, the flags will have more meaningful names isEligibleForReview, isPastDueForReview, etc..p  pSo a is this a reasonable approach, and b if so, whats the best way to compute those flagsp  pSome options were considering for computing flagsp  ol lipMake the set of flags a view, and calculate the flag values from the underlying data in real time using SQL or PLSQL this is an Oracle DB.  This way the values are always accurate, but performance may suffer, and the rules would have to be maintained by a developer.pli lipMake the set of flags consist of static data, and use some type of rules engine to keep those flags uptodate as the underlying data changes.  This way the rules can be maintained more easily, but the flags could potentially be inaccurate at a given point in time.  If we go with this approach, is there a rules engine that can easily manipulate data within a database in this waypli ol

Negative 359 pSo, for larger networks with large data sets, they take a while to train.  It would be awesome if there was a way to share the computing time across multiple machines. However, the issue with that is that when a neural network is training, the weights are constantly being altered every iteration, and each iteration is more or less based on the last  which makes the idea of distributed computing at the very least a challenge. p  pIve thought that for each portion of the network, the server could send maybe a 1000 sets of data to train a network on... but... youd have roughly the same computing time as I wouldnt be able to train on different sets of data simultaneously which is what I want to do.  p  pBut even if I could split up the networks training into blocks of different data sets to train on, how would I know when Im done with that set of data especially if the amount of data sent to the client machine isnt enough to achieve the desired errorp  pI welcome all ideas.p

Negative 359 pI have two servers with hostnames codecomp1code and codecomp2code. I also have a floating alias codemastercode that is dynamically mapped to one of the two servers.

It is an actual different IP addrress that codecomp1comp2code dynamically bindunbind to while the application is running.p  pCan you explain what I am seeing here, or suggest some avenues to investigatep

The installer needs to be able to either get the files from a web server, or be able to package the files into a single installer file.p  pThe end result I am looking for is a user hits a webpage, they can click a link to download a single installer file and the installer goes ahead and installs each of the programs.  Quiet installations would be preferable but not absolutely necessary.

I have entertained the idea of using Java Web Start to run a Java program that can install everything, but I am not sure the plausibility of that.  If that is possible, then the user would not even need to run a file the Java Web Start would just take care of everything.p

Negative 359 pI want a simple and lightweighted way of making crossdomain requests to my api address emapi.example.comem which is a subdomain of my main domain emexample.comem.p  pIve read A LOT about techniques and hacks to deal with XDRs and their incompatibilities with each used browser but XDR is still very complicated for me. I dont need a completecomplex solution as easyXDM, which I have implemented and worked perfectly.p  pSo, I decided to enable CORS which solved the problem for modern Webkit and Gecko browsers. But as always, there is the IE and in this case Opera too which is not compatible with CORS yet. p  pAs I wanted to continue using jQuery AJAX methods, I searched for a solution that would allow XDR with jQuery methods. Then, I implemented a very nice solution by a hrefhttpsgist.github.combenvinegar relnofollowbenvinegara which replaces jQuery.ajax method and therefore all its dependent methods a hrefhttpsgist.github.com859940 relnofollowhttpsgist.github.com859940a. His script is based on the document.domainiframe trick.p  pBefore calling the function proposed by Ben, I tested for CORS support with jQuery.support.cors using jQuery 1.6.2. Everything is okay, working perfectly.p  pThe only thing Im not happy with the above linked script is that I need to load the jQuery library from emapi.example.comem and I dont want that. Ive made a bundle of minified javascript librariespluginsscripts in one file which is used by emexample.comem that gives me me 2 options for using jQuery in emapi.example.comem load the entire bundle again or load a noncached version of jQuery only. I dont like either.p  pstrongMy question isstrong is it possible to change the DOM of an iframe from the parent frame when both frames have the same document.domain If so, could I clone jQuery from emexample.comem into the childiframe emapi.example.comem How Or Im just being crazy about this and there is a better solution taking in consideration what I describedp  pThank you all in advance, Leonardo.p

Negative 359 pIm running into the following design problemp  pIm using the Qt C library for an application.  In this library there are the model classes which all inherit from codeQAbstractItemModelcode like codeQAbstractTableModelcode, codeQStandardItemModelcode, etc..  I want to inherit from several of these classes but define my own interface they must each share.p  pThe way Im currently doing this is by defining an interface pure virtual class and having the inheriting classes inherit from this as well.  As an example, lets say I want a class to inherit from codeQAbstractTableModelcode to have a codedoSomethingcode functionp  precodeclass MyInterface  public     virtual void doSomething  0  class MyModel  public QAbstractTableModel, public MyInterface      ...  codepre  pHowever, I just want to pass objects around as a codeQAbstractItemModelcode.  To use the interface classes I have to cast them to codeMyInterfacecode objects and then call the functions, which leads to casts all over the place.  Further, if anyone else makes their own class inhheriting from codeQAbstractItemModelcode it seems like theres room for error if they do not inherit the interface as well.p  pIs there a better design I could be using to accomplish all thisp

Negative 359 pAFAIK, SSL is assigned to a single domain name maybe several subdomains via wildcard.p  pOn the other hand i heard that the webserver does not see the domain before it serves the sslp  pIf I have multiple domains running as vhosts on one IP addressp  pQ1 Can the webserver serve the appropriate respective SSL to the sitesp  pQ2 Is there a way to have only one multidomain SSL serving two domains on one IPp  pIlluminate me out of confusion brought upon me by this seemingly selfcontradictory quotep  blockquote   pRegular SSL Certificates are issued for a single FQDN Fully Qualified   Domain Name. The domain using the certificate has to have its own   unique external IP address from which to be served. In practice, this   means that if you have multiple domains on a single IP addressserver,   then you had to install a separate certificate on each domain you   wanted to secure.p      pThe reason for this is the use of HostHeaders. They allow a   web server to use a single IP address to serve many separate sites   with different FQDNs. They do this by identifying the incoming request   for a webpage, and routing it to the correct site accordingly.p      pWhen an SSL connection is initiated, the server must send a   certificate to the client  before it knows the hostheader of the   request. The only identifying piece of data it has is the requested IP   address. As such, two or more sites on one IP address cannot use   different SSL certificates....p blockquote

Negative 359 pThere are 2 tables.  1 tblBidder and 1 tblItem.  They share 1 field that makes the association between the fields in each table.  It is the biddernumber for tblBidder and itembiddernumber for tblItem.  Then, they have a corresponding field of biddersaleid for tblBidder and itemsaleid for tblItem.  This field is for a group of items being sold all during 1 sitting.  So you could have 20 different items being sold individually, but they all have the same sale ID because they are being sold on the same day.p  pI am trying to pull a report of the total number of bidders per bidder type who were registered for auction 235, and also find out how much the total sale was that auction for that particular group.

Negative 359 pBackgroundp  ol lipDeveloping a trading system which subscribe to many events which are sent by API of Interactive Brokers. One interesting event is about my trading account value which fluctuates during trading hour so I would prefer to see the information with accountvalueupdate event immediately. I develop this one based on ActiveX api and c in Visual Studio 2010.pli lipthe presentation I wanna check this information is to use a gauge developed byhttpwww.devexpress.comProductsNETControlsWinFormsGauges. This gauge looks fancy but the principle should be similar to the normal gauge we use in Visual Studio. It seems like I could only update the value of the gauge by databinding since I tried to assign updated account value to this.myGauge.value and failed.pli lipI build up MySql connection between MySql and VS2010. I create only one table in MySQL which is called account. For the sake of simplicity, i only have two columnaccountID and accountValue and one rowwhich means when event comes with new accountValue, I just overwrite the value of accountValue last session then the number of row is always one. really simple idea......In that Gauge proporties I found databinng option and I setted up by using advanced option to navigate throw available table and bind it to the only useful column accountValue.pli ol  pIssuep  ol liI set up the default value of the accountValue as 500 as default for test. I build my software. The gauge shows 500 correctly. li liOf course, my real account value is not 500, so Now I click one button to connect to API and start listening the event. After few seconds, event arrives since I opened on Console for managing the mysql table and use select  from account to continuously watch the update. I noticed the value of accountValue columnTABLE WORKS RIGHT AND WE ONLY HAVE ONE ROW, OEVERWRITTING MODE becomes the right one, for example, 35000. li ol  pHOWEVER, THE GAUGE DOES NOT CHANGE AT ALL... Now If i closed my software and build again, the gauge shows the right value 35000. Now I shut down the api and no coming event and only use commandline of mysql to change the value of accountValue again to 500. NO UPDATING in gauge as well.p  pIt looks like the gauge only read the value of table during the build session or when it starts and never listen to the update of binding databases.p  pBy the way, I tried to set up the biding data mode to either onValidation or onPropertieschanged but it does not solve although the onPropertieschanged looks the right one....p

Negative 359 pWhile debugging a java process that is normally ready in 90 seconds, my server application kept timing out after 10 minutes because I had a method entry breakpoint set before the breakpoint ever even had a chance to trip.p  pAccording to the accepted answer to this SO question, this is at least partly due to the Hotspot JIT compiler being disabled when an entry breakpoint is set. a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions751105whydoesthedebuggedprogramslowdownsomuchwhenusingmethodentrydebugginWhy does the debugged program slow down so much when using method entry debuggingap  pHowever, my JVM seemed to be running orders of magnitude slower. The process I was debugging is multithreaded and I was debugging remotely via eclipse. Looking at the task manager when the entry breakpoint was set showed one core performing significantly more work than the other cores. With the breakpoint removed, the load across the cores was more even.p  pWhile at least some of the slowness can be explained by JIT compilation being disabled, I am wondering if method entry breakpoints check with the debugger process for every method invocation, in effect causing the threads to synchronize on the remote debugger process for every method invocation. To me, it seems this could cause more significant slowdown than the loss of JIT.p

Negative 359 pSo Im working on a website with a lot of many to many data base relationships, and because I am still a bit new to querying relational databases, I am struggling a bit. so I have several tables that I am trying to get related data from. Im not going to go into the entire data base, because it is quite large, I am trying to get the number of comments on all of a particular users posts and the number of likes that post has, and the way I was going about it was using a LEFT JOIN like so p  precode  SELECT Post.idPosts, Post.Title, Post.Dateposte,   COUNTPosthasComments.PostidPost,    COUNTPosthasLikes.PostidStories   FROM Post   LEFT JOIN PosthasComments ON Post.idPost  S     PosthasComments.PostidStories LEFT JOIN PosthasLikes ON Post.idPost  PosthasLikes.PostidStories WHERE Post.idUsers    1 codepre  pBut the problem Im running into is if there are no comments or no likes this will return an error, in addition if there is a like or a comment it will return the highest number in both fields, for instance if there are 3 comments on a post and 1 like it will return 3 in the like field too, because it is counting the number of rows it is returning i guess. so my question is how do I actually get the real number of likes and comments and put in that field, and have it return 0 if there are none instead of an error p

Negative 359 pI am refactoring a large scientific program. The main code for the application consists of tens of equations using hundreds of parameters. Because this calculation code has been tested extensively, I dont want to change it.p  pSome of the parameters may be logically lumped together in sets, e.g., there may be sets of parameters corresponding to a given instrument. Simulations are to be run by swapping in and out different sets of parameters.p  pI would like to maintain the parameters in a separate file so that they may be changed easily.p  pMy question is this How do I import the parameters into the calculation module namespace in a way that will allow me to specify which sets are usedp  pRight now, I am using what seems to be a hack. In the parameters module, I hold values in dictionaries. For example,p  precode start paramsmodule  instrument1  dictparam11.0, param22.0, ... instrument2  dictparam13.0, param24.0, ... instrument3  dictparam15.0, param26.0, ... miscparams  dictparam10  10, param1120, ... ...  end paramsmodule  codepre  pI then import the dictionary of interest in the calculationmodule namespace and add it into the globals dictionaryp  precode start calculationmodule  from paramsmodule import instrument1, miscparams globals.updateinstrument1  globals.updatemiscparams ... many equations that make use of param1, param2, etc. ...  end calculationmodule  codepre  pIs there a more Pythonic way to do thisp  pThank you. p  pcytochromep

Negative 359 pIn AspectJ we have two conceptsp  ol liTarget objectli liAOP proxyli ol  pI instantiated a target object and then passed it to the proxy factory and advised it.

Negative 359 pI had to write a program to work for a 30003000 matrix. It was working only up to 600600.p  pSo I ran my program by increasing heap size by codejava Xms64m Xmx1024m ltclassnamegtcode Because initially the codeOutOfMemoryErrorcode was occurring. That solved the problem.p  pNow this same program is used to plot values in Applets. So I made a package and imported it. But then the same error was coming as you cant emrunem an applet.p  pYou can only type codejavac classname.javacode and codeappletviewer classname.javacode.p  pSo there was no way I could increase heap size. So I purposely put a codemaincode function...which calculated the values to be plottedstored in an array.p  pAnd the applet would print them. And the array was static and global.p  pThen I compiled codejavac classname.javacodeand rancodejava Xms64m Xmx1024m ltclassnamegtcode and then typed codeappletviewer classname.javacode.p  pBut 0,0,0,... got displayed. Basically the default values of int array.p  pAs though the codemaincode function never ran. Even though array was global.p  pUltimately, I just need a codemaincode function... and some variable that stores values and retains them when codeppletviewer classname.javacode is typed.p  pIs there any way to do this Or else to increase heap size for appletsp  pBecause when I type the logic in codeinitcode or codepaintcode function the same error comes codeOutOfMemoryErrorcodep
Negative 359 pIm having an issue with an Exchange 2003 WebDAV interaction and Im hoping someone can enlighten me.  We have a calendar synchronization application that keeps a users Exchange calendar up to date with the calendar built into my companys application.  This synchronization is based off of the LastModified property of the given calendar appointments in the WebDAV returns.  p  pThe problem is that if a user modifies an appointment on their iPad or iPhone which is pretty common it does not update the LastModified property of the appointment which makes it appear as if though the appointment doesnt need to be updated for our application.  If we modify the appointment directly in the OWA interface it is updated correctly.  p  pDoes anyone know why this would not be getting updated for device side updates or perhaps even another way that we can track appointment changes  In our synchronization for Exchange 2007 and 2010 we are using the ChangeKey property but to my knowledge that does not exist in the Exchange 2003 WebDAV interface.  Any help is much appreciatedp

Negative 359 pIm planning on a nice app that will be quite useful, regardless of the country its used in. Thats why Im already planning on doing it in multiple languages from the beginning. I know you can easily do that with localization andor other storyboard, but it will also be nice to have the tittle in the corresponding language. If the app is about houses, in english it should be My home and in spanish Mi hogar. Is this possible in the appStore I believe not what about in google PlayAndroid market Would it help to distribute the same app, multiple times, in different languages with the corresponding name, or will this only dilute the downloads and avoid it to become a trending app I think so Any advicep  pThanksp

Negative 359 pI need to cause some code in my application to be preJITted. The scenario is an XNA game running under Windows Phone. When an explosion first happens, there is a noticeable pause while the methods that implement the explosion physical modelling are JITted. I know this because this issue happens on the Windows build as well, and disappears when the assemblies are NGENd. I have also used the method of JITting at runtime which is mentioned in a few answers here and a hrefhttpwww.codeproject.comArticles31316PrecompilepreJITyourassemblyontheflyortr relnofolloworiginates on CodeProjecta using reflection and a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibrarysystem.runtime.compilerservices.runtimehelpers.preparemethod.aspx relnofollowcodePrepareMethodcodea .p  pHowever, I cant use NGEN, because its a Windows Phone app. I also cant use the other method codePrepareMethodcode is marked as codeSecurityCriticalcode, and you cant call that on Windows Phone.p  pI dont mind the fact that it may take some time, because the initialisation would happen on a separate thread while a loading screen is displayed.p  pAre there any elegant methods to achieve a similar result and, failing that, any methods at allp

Negative 359 pI am using the OpenGL ES 2.0 GLSL functionality to manipulate images. What I want to achieve is to select a specific Level Of Detail LOD when fetching a sample from a texture from within a fragment shader. Apparently codetexture2DLodcode is not supported for fragment shaders in OpenGL ES 2.0 but there is an extension a hrefhttpwww.khronos.orgregistryglesextensionsEXTEXTshadertexturelod.txt relnofollowcodeGLEXTshadertexturelodcodea that can optionally provide it.p  pHowever, the default codetexture2Dcode function provides a third optional parameter bias. As far as I understand, this parameter is supposed to be an offset added to the current LOD.p  pIn my tests Im drawing a quad the size of the screen and Im magnifying a texture by scaling the sample coordinates. Ive enabled mipmapping for the texture using GLLINEARMIPMAPLINEAR as a minification filter. The result when sampling with a nonzero bias parameter on the ARM Mali400 GPU can be seen in the image below.p  pISTM that some pixels are using the minification filter while others are using the magnification filter.p  pHow is this controlled And how do I determine the initial LOD when using bias Can it be adjusted from the vertex shaderp  pA related question is the following onep  pa hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions7367606howdoesaglslsamplerdeterminetheminificationandthusthemipmapleveloHow does a GLSL sampler determine the minification, and thus the mipmap level, of a textureap  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comkBNTh.png alttexture2D with bias parameter on ARM Mali400p  pUpdate I noticed that if I sample the texture so that it covers the screen, then it seems to do the proper mipmap lookup even though it is magnified. Now, if I add a small offset to the sample coordinates, then I will begin to see the banding that is seen in the above image which is magnified even more. If I dont use the bias parameter I will not see any banding at all.p

Negative 359 pI do large simulations on supercomputers. Since these simulations are expensive to run, I need to write the results every now and then to disk. Also, most supercomputers have maximum runtime of 1 or two days after which your job is automatically terminated. As a result I need to be able add a resume feature to my application.p  pFor large datasets, I use raw binary files since this is the fastest you can dump information to disk. Later on, I can convert these binary files to formats that can be postprocessed on a normal desktop. However, I also need to log some parametric information about the simulation when the code is running so that I wont have any problem figuring out what set of parameters do my result correspond to.p  pFurthermore, I need to have a configure file so that the parameters can be set from when I startresume jobs. What I want to do is to merge loggingconfigure file into one step so that the code can log all needed information into a configure file for the next resume. I also need this file to be easily humanreadable, hierarchical, and have good support in terms of libraries for parsing. My main concern is the language Im developing in, namely codeCcode but it could be nice to have support in codepythoncode as well.p  pSo far Im doing this in codexmlcode using codeboostpropertytreecode but Im not sure this is the best way to go. Specifically, my codexmlcode files seem a little bit too verbose Are there any better options for the file format that I could use How about library support I prefer headeronly libraries to prevent changes to the build structure.  p
Negative 359 pI have a site, which show all products in a grid on its index page. I use a hash symbol to make some of the products active I mean  some products are shown with a border around it, others are inactive. Ex codehttpmysite.net15code  shows product 15 with a border, all other are inactive.p  pUnfortunately, that format is not so good for indexing in Google, because all products and info are in one place and I cant form a good structure for that. To solve that, I wrote a script that generates a single product view with another URL. Ex codehttpmysite.comproductcolorseparation.htmlcode  shows only one product. This is good to use in the sitemap, But I want my visitors to see the products in a grid view.p  pIf I put some javascript in a single page view to redirect visitors from codehttpmysite.comproductcolorseparation.htmlcode to the grid view with the product activated at codehttpmysite.net15code will this cause any trouble when the Google bot is going through all single pages in the sitemapp

Negative 359 pI have successfully implemented a clientserver Android GCM application. My app server holds a database of deviceregistrationid pairs. Messages are sent to the devices via web accessible PHP pages. I am trying to write the error handling on the server side, specifically the case where the response contains a canonicalid. The developer docs are quite clear about what needs to be done and why such a response might be producedp  blockquote   pCanonical IDsp      pOn the server side, as long as the application is behaving well,   everything should work normally. However, if a bug in the application   triggers multiple registrations for the same device, it can be hard to   reconcile state and you might end up with duplicate messages.p      pGCM provides a facility called canonical registration IDs to easily   recover from these situations. A canonical registration ID is defined   to be the ID of the last registration requested by your application.   This is the ID that the server should use when sending messages to the   device.p      pIf later on you try to send a message using a different registration   ID, GCM will process the request as usual, but it will include the   canonical registration ID in the registrationid field of the   response. Make sure to replace the registration ID stored in your   server with this canonical ID, as eventually the ID youre using will   stop working.p blockquote  pSo within my Android client app I have a development only button which will register the device with GCMRegistrar.register a second time without bothering to unregister it first. I had assumed that this would get me a registrationid different from the first time I registered it, and that sending a message to the device from the web maybe using the old id would give me a response with a canonicalid. p  pstrongHowever the second registration returns exactly the same regid as the first time.strongp  pThus sending a message via the PHP on my server wont show a canonicalid in the response. I really need to test the situation where a canonicalid is returned, indicating that I need to update my database as my PHP skills are not the finestp  pSo any ideas as to how I could provoke such a response would be gratefully receivedp  pUpdate I just tried uninstalling the app from the phone, then reinstalling it. I still get the same regid.p
Negative 359 pI am coding a small numeric analysis library in C. I have been trying to implement using the latest C11 features including move semantics. I understand the discussion and top answer at the following post a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions4986673c11rvaluesandmovesemanticsconfusionC11 rvalues and move semantics confusiona , but there is one scenario that I still am trying to wrap my head around.p  pI have a class, call it codeTcode, which is fully equipped with overloaded operators. I also have both copy and move constructors.p  precodeT const T amp  initialization via copy  T T ampamp  initialization via move  codepre  pMy client code heavily uses operators, so I am trying to ensure that complex arithmetic expressions get maximum benefit from move semantics. Consider the followingp  precodeT a, b, c, d, e T f  a  b  c  d  e codepre  pWithout move semantics, my operators are making a new local variable using the copy constructor each time, so there are a total of 4 copies. I was hoping that with move semantics I could reduce this to 2 copies plus some moves. In the parenthesized versionp  precodeT f  a  b  c  d  e codepre  peach of codeb  ccode and coded  ecode must create the temporary in the usual way with a copy, but then it would be great if I could leverage one of those temporaries to accumulate the remaining results with only moves.p  pUsing g compiler, I have been able to do this, but I suspect my technique may not be safe and I want to fully understand why.p  pHere is an example implementation for the addition operatorp  precodeT operator T constamp x const      T resultthis      logic to perform addition here using result as the target     return stdmoveresult  T operator Tampamp x const       logic to perform addition here using x as the target     return stdmovex  codepre  pWithout the calls to codestdmovecode, then only the codeconst ampcode version of each operator is ever invoked. But when using codestdmovecode as above, subsequent arithmetic after the innermost expressions are performed using the codeampampcode version of each operator. p  pI know that RVO can be inhibited, but on very computationallyexpensive, realworld problems it seems that the gain slightly outweighs the lack of RVO. That is, over millions of computations I do get a very tiny speedup when I include codestdmovecode. Though in all honesty it is fast enough without. I really just want to fully comprehend the semantics here.p  pIs there a kind C Guru who is willing to take the time to explain, in a simple way, whether and why my use of stdmove is a bad thing here Many thanks in advance.p

Negative 359 pWhat is the best way to prevent MVC 4 overpostingp  pAccording to MS sources, the [Bind] attribute is supposed to be the easiest way to prevent overposting by preventing incoming form values from making it to the database.  With the latest version of MVC amp EF this does not seem to be working as expectedadvertised, unless Im missing something major.p  pFrom emWrox Professional ASP.NET MVC 4em Jon Galloways Chapter 7, the following class should prevent overpostingp  precode[BindExcludeIsAdmin] public class User      public int ID  get set      public string FirstName  get set      public bool IsAdmin  get set   codepre  pBut all the [Bind] attribute does is prevent the form submission values from binding to the model.  The model then has a blankdefault value, which is written back to the database.  In this case, it would ensure that IsAdmin  false EVERY TIME you call .SaveChanges using this model.  Any true values are overwritten.  Thats a HUGE security failure.p  pThe alternate syntax  placing [Bind] in the Edit controller action parameter  does the exact same thingp  precodepublic ActionResult Edit[BindExclude  IsAdmin] User user codepre  pAll true values are overwritten when .SaveChanges is called, contradicting K. Scott Allens blog post on the topic a hrefhttpodetocode.comblogsscottarchive20120311completeguidetomassassignmentinaspnetmvc.aspx relnofollowhttpodetocode.comblogsscottarchive20120311completeguidetomassassignmentinaspnetmvc.aspxap  pThe only alternative seems to be a flurry of dedicated ViewModels all wired up with Automapper.  While secure, that seems like a MASSIVE headache, especially asp  ul liYou may have different requirements for Create, Edit, Index, and Detail actions, requiring different ViewModelsli liYou may need to expose some readonly fields such as CreatedBy on the Edit action that cannot have the [ReadOnly] attribute on the property because they are updated by the Create actionli ul  pI know that somebody is going to respond by saying you should strongneverstrong bind data models to views, but that is the default template behavior and the way its shown in nearly all documentation.  And besides, MVC  EF was supposed to make life emeasierem, not emharderem, and an ocean of ModelView classes wired up with AutoMapper is not what I consider easier.p  pSo does anybody know how to make [Bind] function as advertisedp

Negative 359 pIm currently adding the option to start my app from another app. The app will look and behave differently when started from another app. The entry point activity is passed a different intent action and some extras.  I need to save those extras for other activities but I cannot save them in the app, Because that will affect the app when launched from the launcher. The only solution I can think of is to pass the extras for each new activity intent.putExtrasgetIntent And so maintain a state for the current stack. Is there a better way Thanks, Sharon.p

Negative 359 pI am currently working on a project to make a website more accessible. In that regard I have encountered a problem related to tabindextab order. A menu button, once clicked, displays a submenu containing a menubar with two tabs. Each of these tabs, when clicked, displays another submenu. What I want is to be able to focus directly on the first tab when the menu is clicked. Once the first tab has gotten focus, one should be able to tab back and forth between this and the second tab, and select either one of these by pressing Enter. p  pOnce an item has been selected, pressing tab should continue to go through all the items in the submenu displayed for the selected tab. I have created the following code for thisp  precode     First set the tabindex for both tabs to 0 to be able to      tab through them sequentially     tab1.attrtabindex, 0     tab2.attrtabindex, 0       Set focus on the first tab once the main menu link has been clicked     menulink.clickfunction tab1.focus        Select appropriate tab when ENTER is pressed     tab1.keydownfunctionevent           ifevent.which  13  event.preventDefault          tab1.click          tab2.keydownfunctionevent          ifevent.which  13  event.preventDefault          tab2.click      codepre  pThe problem occurs if I press tab to go to tab2 and then try to shifttab back to tab1 and select that.

Negative 359 pI am trying to create a carousel, where clicking on any element will slide it leftwards, simultaneously sliding the right element into viewport. For that, I need to have the codedivcodes stacked side by side. I am trying it out as a codefloatcode based layout see a hrefhttpjsfiddle.netCupidvogelnf5Dh relnofollowFiddlea . p  pProblem is that here clicking the red colored codedivcode slides it leftward alright, but not the green element leftwards. This is probably due to the fact that they are actually lying below another, as visible when the codeoverflow hiddencode is removed from codecontcodes style. How elese to stack them side by side so that sliding one leftward automatically slides the next one leftwards as well Creating the tobenext element on the fly while clicking and animating it into viewport is a nono, the element should be present in the DOMp

Negative 359 pI have been searching for this a bit on Google, and there are also some topics on StackOverFlow but they dont answer the main question Why sometimes, under GCC on LINUX and I mean Linux since on MinGW it doesnt happen with the SAME code, an application compiles and links correctly with other libraries, without any errors and then, on execution time, undefined symbols are thrownp  pWhy wasnt this undefined symbol thrown during compilationlinking timep  pWhat is the reason for the linker to accept the libraries and the code even though that such function has not been defined Why only during execution time this problem is detectedp  pEDITp  pWhat it happens is for example, I have, on a header file of Class A the method play but then i never implemented Aplay. When calling this function from another project file, which Links to the initial library where Class A is defined doesnt give me any undefined symbol error, when it should, since Aplay is not implemented. Later on, on Execution time, the application crashes on explicit load of Libraries, and I get the error string saying undefined symbol play, for example. Quite strange... p

Negative 359 pIm doing a storyboard segue when tapping a navigation bar button item, from view controller A to view controller B, and it works fine with a push animation. But when I tap the back button no custom code the previous view A just pops into place without the sliding animation.

Ive made sure that Im only popping it once.p  pThis has been tested in the simulator as well as on a device. p  pI suspect it has something to do with what happens when view controller B is being unloaded or something similar, but I cant put my finger on it.

Im doing calls to outlets in various setters and getters but again have been careful to only do it if the view is loaded in case that would cause the view to reload after being unloaded. No success.p  pFinally did a log in Bs codeviewWillDisappearcode, and codeanimatedcode is set to false. Whys thatp  pI dont know what to do next, my segue has the push style in the storyboard.p

Were using Xamarin.iOS, but I hope that shouldnt matter for this question.p  pSome of our customers that will get the App are using an MDM AirWatch to manage devices and install the App on their devices. For development we used the iOS App Development together with our devices to debug and test the app.p  pNow theres time to get the App to our first customer. For that the app must be signed with a Distribution Certificate and bundled with a Distribution Provisioning profile. For these to generate, one has to be enrolled in the iOS Developer Enterprise program, which is 299year. Before spending that money, Id like to make sure Im doing the right thing.p  pSeveral questions here suggest that the customers company not we as the ISV that uses the MDM to provision the devices should enroll in the iOS Developer Enterprise program and should provide us as the ISV company with a Distribution Certificate and a Distribution Provisioning profile. Here are the questionsp  ul lia hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions11363496distributinganenterpriseinhouseiosappDistributing an enterprise inhouse iOS appali lia hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions9216485howtomanageenterprisedistributioncertificateexpirationHow to manage Enterprise Distribution certificate expirationali ul  pMy guess is that the client has to enroll in the iOS Developer Enterprise program. And that the client has to provide us with Distribution Certificate and Distribution Provisioning profile.p  pMy question now is Why is it that the client has to be part of the iOS Developer Enterprise program Every new client also has to enroll in the program. Wouldnt it be easier if we as the ISV would enroll in the program Are the legal implications why we shouldnt do thatp

Negative 359 pIve purchased a Foscam FI8910W IP webcam which outputs a live video stream in MJPEG format, and Im trying to embed the live stream in a webpage.p  pIve already accomplished this goal by simply using the camera feeds URL as the source for an HTML img tag. The problem with this is that each browser session accessing this page connects to the camera, so the limited bandwidth that the camera has is quickly used up, so no more than 2 or 3 users can view the page at the same time.p  pWhat I would like to do is set up some sort of streaming server to access the cameras feed directly, and reproduceprocess it in some way so that when users browse to my site they are pulling from the server rather than the camera.p  pIdeally this would be done without the need for any browser plugins, and would work across any browser. Im pretty experienced in several programming languages, so writing something to handle this is not totally out of the question, I just dont have the slightest idea how to get started. p

P1 export some classes, which are used by P2. P2 additionally exports other classes and interfaces, which are used by P3. In particular, P2 defines and exports stronginterface MyInterfacestrong and its implementation strongclass MyInterfaceImpl implements MyInterfacestrong. P3 is an application and, thus, contains a strongclass Launcher implements IApplicationstrong and defines the strongpublic Object startIApplicationContextstrong method. Everything compiles fine. When I run the Launcher as an Eclipse application from Eclipse, it runs fine. The launcher uses strongMyInterfacestrong and strongMyInterfaceImplstrong fine.p  pNow, I programmatically run my application using the following simple code, which seems to be a okay way of running an EquinoxEclipse application, according to various postsp  precodevoid callApplication      final String[] args          new String[]              application,             Launcher,             ...      EclipseStarter.runargs, null  codepre  pAgain, this piece of code works fine and I can see my application run and produce its expected results.p  pNow, here comes my problem I would like to obtain an instance of strongMyInterfaceImplstrong built by my application, running in Equinox, back inside the outer Java code. My nave solution was to return this object in the strongpublic Object startIApplicationContextstrong method and modify my calling code as followsp  precodeMyInterface callApplication      final String[] args          new String[]              application,             Launcher,             ...      return MyInterface EclipseStarter.runargs, null  codepre  pBut this nave solution does not work. I receive a strongjava.lang.ClassCastException MyInterfaceImpl cannot be cast to MyInterfacestrong. Thinking of it, it makes sense because, at the end of strongcallApplicationstrong, I have two versions of the pairs strongMyInterfacestrong, strongMyInterfaceImplstrong one from the outer Java code, loaded by the JVM classloader, and another from Equinox, loaded by Equinox classloader. I modified my code to print the classloaders of the returned object and of strongMyInterfacestrong p  precodefinal Object o  EclipseStarter.runargs, null System.out.printlno.getClass.getClassLoader System.out.printlnMyInterface.class.getClassLoader codepre  pand, indeed, I obtained p  precodeorg.eclipse.osgi.internal.baseadaptor.DefaultClassLoader7e66458c[P21.5.0id413] sun.misc.LauncherAppClassLoader1efc3d2 codepre  pNote that the classloader of the returned object is said to come from P2, as expected, because P2 is the plugin that defines and exports strongMyInterfacestrong and strongMyInterfaceImplstrong. p  pI tried different ways to get compatible pairs of strongMyInterfacestrong, strongMyInterfaceImplstrong but with no luck so far I always get the same strongjava.lang.ClassCastException MyInterfaceImpl cannot be cast to MyInterfacestrongp  ul lipI tried setting the properties Dorg.osgi.framework.bootdelegation Dorg.osgi.framework.system.packages.extraMyInterface,MyInterfaceImpl. pli lipI also tried intercepting the strongDefaultClassLoaderstrong in the strongstartstrong method. pli ul  pSo, my question is emIs there a way for a Java program, which uses some classes defined in a project, which is also a plugin and which export these classes, to exchange instances of these classes with an instance of Eclipse started programmaticallyem Thanksp

Negative 359 pI have an issue with an excel spreadsheet I want to see if I can do without VBA just because it seems easier to implement that way. Basically, there are many columns in the sheet I want to sort. However, I merely want to look at three columns the title column, the data column and the status column.p  pIn a new spreadsheet, there will be four sections. Each section corresponds to 3 months of the year ie Jan, Feb, Mar. will map to the first column on the new spreadsheet, April, May, June will map to the second column on the new spreadsheet.p  pBased on the date, and if the status column has the word Finished in the original spreadsheet, I want to map the title to a certain column under the new spreadsheet based on the date criteria as described in the previous paragraph. So for example, if the original spreadsheet has following p  precodeTitle Date Status  Doc1 11213 Finished Doc2 21013 UnFinished Doc3 4113  Finished Doc4 33113 Finished codepre  pWould map to, on the new spreadsheetp  precode1st Column  2nd Column Doc1         Doc3  Doc4 codepre  pI have looked a lot into pivot tables but I cant automate it as much as I want to. I have gotten it down to the point where I can change the pivot tables into filtering based on date, but I want it even more automated than that. Ive also tried excel formulas but that has been to no avail. Thanks for the help, I really appreciate itp

Numerous examples online used generic V objects and it makes sense  each node irl would have extra information, whether a stops name or whatever.pp

Negative 359 pIm writing a simple app to enable adb over ethernet on startup of the android, with a cancel button to prevent the enabling of the of the adb on the network. When the popup for superuser appears, if clicked immediately everything is fine, but if I wait a few seconds and click ok, the display fails to update. p  pThe onCreate uses a mHandler to start a runnable, which is used for the countdown timer. When I used a mHandler.postDelayed to try to delay past the startup process, the display is never updated. When I use mHandler.postAtFrontOfQueue the countdown display functions properly, but following the superuser dialog the screen fails to update. p  pThe countdown timer uses mHandler.postAtTime to repeatedly call the runnable. Im thinking I need to put something at the start of the runnable to reset the focus, but am still new to the android and not having any luck figuring out what would make it happy.p  pWhen the application is run manually, everything is correct. On a second android, everything is correct. p
Negative 359 pI dont know the proper way to say this, so here is my issue.p  pI am dealing with an API that sends information to the server, from either web form or whatever in this format     codehttpservernonagentapi.phpsourcetestampuser6666amppass1234code.... with a bunch more parameters.p  pNormally, I have dealt with APIs that just send it with SOAP or REST, not in a URL like that. My question is how do I send that information using php or something. So if I wanted to take in a username and password from a webform, how do I send that link to the server without clicking on the URL itself.p  pI hope that makes sense. Thanks for the help.p

Negative 359 pSay I have a thread pool of some kind.  I submit one thread to it and it goes on its merry way.  I want to block the main thread until the pool is emptyall threads have finished, without busy waiting preferably.p  pBut the thread can create and add its own threads to the pool a quantity that is unknown beforehand... so it is important that the pool may continue to accept and process threads normally while the main thread blocks.

Negative 359 pIm trying to build a struts2 application but faces with many difficulty. p  pAfter many days of research, I had successfully built a Dynamic Web Project strutsJSP containing codeweb.xmlcode,codestruts.xmlcode, code.jspcode,code.javacode.

Negative 359 pI have been having some troubles setting up a personal server for a while. I recently bought a Raspberry Pi to use as a server so I could teach myself networking, server management, etc. I was under the impression that as soon as I set it up, got it connected, and enabled ssh that I could connect to it with userhostname. However, whenever I try to connect to it I get the error p  pcodessh Could not resolve hostname xxxx nodename nor servname provided, or not knowncodep  pThe only way I can connect to it is by replacing the hostname with my local IP, meaning I cannot access it outside of my home network. I have been toying around with it for about a month trying to get it to work. I have been playing with DNS servers, meddling in the localhost file, and trying various other things to make it so I can connect with the hostname. It is not limited to codesshcode either, I cannot connect to it as an FTP server without using my local IP.p  pI live on campus in my colleges dorms, and I have a theory that my college is obstructing me from connecting to it without being on my local network. What are your thoughts on this Is this common practice a security measure Or is my problem something else entirelyp  pOS 92513 release of Raspbianp  pIf this should be moved to the Raspberry Pi section of the site, please inform me and I will promptly relocate itp

Negative 359 pI am currently working on a tool written in MScript that executes a set of checks on a given simulink model. This tool does not compileexecute the model, Im using codefindsystemcode and codegetparamcode to retrieve all the information I need in order to run the routines of my tool.p  pIve reached a point where I need to determine whether a certain block has directfeedthrough or not. I am not entirely sure how to do this. Two possible solutions come to mindp  ul liA property might store this information and might be accessible via codegetparamcode. After investigating this, I could not find any such property.li liSome block types have directfeedthrough Sum, Logic, ..., some other do not Unit Delay, Integrator, so I could use the block type to determine whether a block has directfeedthrough or not. Since Im not an experienced Simulink modeller, Im not sure if its possible to tell whether a block has directfeedthrough by solely looking at its block type. Also, this would require a lookup table including all Simulink block types. An impossible task, since additional block types might get added to Simulink via third party modules.li ul  pAny help or pointers to possible solutions are greatly appreciated.p

Negative 359 pIm using QueryDSL 3.2.4 with Spring Data JPA 1.4.2 serving as my Repository layer. I have a class to take my web form object a simple Bean that Spring binds the search form to and generate the QueryDSL Criteria object for it, which then gets passed to the businessdata layer to run the query.p  pIm trying to figure out the best way to unit test this generation of a Criteria object. Depending on what is being searched for, different combinations of fields will be in the query Basically, the typical search form, where fields can be blank to not constrain based on it, but each nonblank field indicates a search criterion, and some fields may have some additional options such as whether its for exact match, starts with, or contains.p  pTheres a a hrefhttpwww.petrikainulainen.netprogrammingspringframeworkspringdatajpatutorialpartnineconclusions relnofollowSpring Data JPA tutoriala which advocates for the use of QueryDSL over JPA Criteria API, in part because one can unit test QueryDSL just by comparing the .toString. So, thats the way Im leaning toward for now, of making sure that the resulting Criteria objects toString is reasonable for the query Im trying to test, but Im not sure how Id get the expected toString without constructing the desired query ahead of time and seeing what its toString is, so it feels like not a great test, and it feels like its based on the internals of QueryDSL which may be subject to change. I think of toString on most classes as mainly being a debugging aid, not a part of the spec, though if somebody pointed me to a spec on how QueryDSL creates its toString methods and that its part of the way to use andor test usage of the library, I think Id be a lot happier with this approach. Im hoping theres something better.p  pTheres another StackOverflow question a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comq1483724365839How do I unit test the querydsl query inside the given methoda, but that looks to be about testing entire queries and needing a mock EntityManager. Im hoping to just test the Criteria part, so Im hoping theres a simpler approach than that, where Id need to mock up a Query thats using the Criteria and then a mock EntityManager to use it, and that all looks to me more complicated than what Im trying to do for just unit testing that Im creating a Criteria object correctly.p  pI feel like I cant be the only person trying to test that Im creating the right Criteria. Thanks for any insights you may have into what Im doing wrong or how one can unit test this better.p

Negative 359 p9 times out of 10, when I want to use the codeSubstringcode method on a string, its because I want to shave some characters off the END of the string, not the start.  While the default Substring does have support for this, it does so by taking a second parameter which is the length of the desired string, rather than the endpoint.  This means if I consistently want to shave off N characters off of a series of strings of differing length, I have to do an extra step, which can result in a good deal more code.  Take for examplep  precodeShaving the first N chars string trimmed  foo.bar.widget.GetType.Name.SubstringN codepre  pvs.p  precodeShaving the last N chars string trimmed  foo.bar.widget.GetType.Name.Substring0, foo.bar.widget.GetType.Name.Length  N codepre  por maybe to save the extra function call, use a second linep  precodestring name  foo.bar.widget.GetType.Name string trimmed  name.Substring0, name.Length  N codepre  pEither way, youre basically doubling the amount of code necessary to shave characters off the end of the string rather than the beginning.  My modification would be simple.  If you pass a negative N which would otherwise be meaningless, it would shave codeNcode characters off the end of the string instead of the beginning.  I can already code this up with an extension methodp  precodepublic static string MySubstringthis string str, int val      return val gt 0  str.Substringval  str.Substring0, str.Length  val  codepre  pAnd then when I want to shave off the final N chars, I just dop  precodestring trimmed  foo.bar.widget.GetType.Name.MySubstringN codepre  pShort and sweet, just like shaving off the beginning characters.  My question is  would it be possible to override the behavior of the default Substring function so that I can do this without having to use my own unique name for the function  Its not like it would invalidate any existing code, because previously there was no reason to pass it a negative number, and doing so would simply throw an exception and crash.  This is just one of those simple nononsense features that feels like it shouldve been part of the implementation to begin with.p

Negative 359 pIm attempting to write an extension for SQL Developer to better support Postgres. These are just XML configuration files with SQL snippets in them. To display the values for a postgres sequence, I need to run a simple query of the following formp  precodeselect  from schema.sequence codepre  pThe trouble with this is that the Oracle SQL Developer environment provides the correct schema and node sequence name as bind variables. This would mean that I should format the query asp  precodeselect  from SCHEMA.NAME codepre  pThe trouble with this is that bind variables are only valid in the select clause or the where clause as far as Im aware, and using this form of the query returns a codesyntax error at or near 1code error message.p  pIs there a way to return the values in the sequence object without directly selecting them from the sequence Perhaps some obtuse joined statement from pgcatalog tablesp

Negative 359 pI am making some experiments with Android Open Accessory Protocol AOA using various phonestablets and Arduino DUE.p  pI need some help to try to find the cause of a different behaviour of a simple app based on AOA that reads data from an analog input pin and that changes the status of a digital output pin of the Arduino DUE.p  pAll phones on which I am trying the app are not rooted and I have verified that all of them have the files p  ol lisystemframeworkcom.android.future.usb.accessory.jarli lisystemetcpermissionsandroid.hardware.usb.accessory.xmlli ol  pthat, as long as I know, are the only two requested to give support to AOA.p  pThe named app works well on a Samsung Galaxy S2 Android version 4.1.2, kernel v3.0.311211311 and on a Galaxy Pocket Neo Android version 4.1.2, kernel v3.0.151456085, but works only partially on a Samsung Galaxy Note 3 Android version 4.3, kernel v3.4.02019540.p  pIn more detail, when I connect the accessory to all of the specified phones also the Galaxy Note 3, it is correctly recognized and the app associated to the Arduino sketch controls correctly an all phones the status of the digital output pin, but the Galaxy Note seems to dont be able to receive from Arduino and to display the message containing the result of the analogtodigital conversion two bytes.p  pThe app is one of the tutorial projects of the UDOO development

So that when the script is done the above hypothetical file looks like thisp  precodeseveral lines of cleartext stuff more specifically email headers  decrypted message 1  some more lines of cleartext  decrypted message 2 codepre  pWhen trying to just use GPG to decrypt the files GPG will skip all the cleartext stuff and just output the strongfirststrong decrypted message.p  pSo I need something like a while loop I think, to independently find all instances that start with BEGIN PGP MESSAGE and end with END PGP MESSAGE and use the GPG command on that, then replace that instance with the output of the GPG command. And then continue to the next instance of encrypted text.p  pSo far I just have these few lines, but they obviously dont properly do what I want. I dont want to have to use the script on each individual file. And I dont want to use a temp file, I guess theres a much better way to do all of this.p  precodebinbash  TEMPFILE1.tmp   grep only the relevant gpg lines to decrypt.  this will output ALL encrypted instances to TEMPFILE sed n BEGIN PGP MESSAGE,END PGP MESSAGEp 1 gt TEMPFILE   decrypt. this will only give me the decrypted output  of the first encrypted instance in TEMPFILE.  and I dont know how to shove this into the proper place in the original file. gpg batch d notty output 1.dc.eml TEMPFILE   remove TEMPFILE rm TEMPFILE codepre  pHere is my made up scripting language hopefully showing a better explanation of what I want to dop  precodefor all files in folder do     while i can find an instance of BEGIN PGP to END PGP do         command gpg decrypt gt tempvar         command replace the instance of BEGIN PGP to END PGP with tempvar     end while end for codepre  pThis is probably pretty simple to achieve I hope but Ive been at this decryption dilemma for days now and I cant properly figure out how to do it.

I came to the conclusion that the space complexity isp  blockquote   pOX  Yp blockquote  pSince there would be at most X recursive calls followed by Y recursive calls so at most XY function calls would be pushed on the stack.p  pHowever, the running time complexity isnt very clear to me.

Negative 359 pIm trying to write a basic game using Apples Sprite Kit framework. So far, I have a ship flying around the screen, using SKPhysicsBody. I want to keep the ship from flying off the screen, so I edited my update method to make the ships velocity zero.

This made the ship bounce, but I dont want the ship to bounce. I just want it to stop at the edge.p  pWhat is the right way to make the ship stop once it reaches the edge The code above works most of the time, but every now and then the ship shoots off screen. This is for OS Xnot iOSin case that matters.p
Negative 359 pI am using superCSV to write data in csv format in my code. Its working absolutely fine and very efficiently , but now my requirement changed .

Negative 359 pIm trying to catch up with modern Web application design approaches.  With the latest technologies, is it still appropriate or necessary to tie a web application to a specific backend language like PHP, ASP.NET or J2EEp  pIve been thinking of HTML5, JavaScript and asynchronous queries.  An application could potentially consist of a series of simple, empty HTML document templates where the data components are filled in after the page load event using JQueryXMLHttpRequest calls to a web service.p  pIn this context, the backend web service could be implemented using any arbitrary framework and the serving of HTML pages could be handle by any web server.  The applications web component would then be purely HTML5 and JavaScript with all other business logic hidden behind a web service interface.p  pBut is this an effective design for complex applications which rely on session management and page transitions  Does anyone code this way or are traditional backend languages always used to generate the HTML documentsp  pThanks.p

Negative 359 pI have two questions about a hrefhttpcraftyjs.com relnofollowCraftya Ive also asked in their google group community, but it seems very few people look at that.p  pIve followed this tutorial a hrefhttpbuildnewgames.comintroductiontocrafty relnofollowhttpbuildnewgames.comintroductiontocraftya and also took a look at the isometric demo in craftys website of a bunch of blocks a hrefhttpcraftyjs.comdemosisometric relnofollowhttpcraftyjs.comdemosisometrica. And Ive been trying some stuff by combining what Ive learned in both.p  pQ1 When I use the fourway component used in the tutorial a lot, if I hold the left arrow key for example and CTRLTAB out the current tab while holding left, and then go back not necessarily holding left anymore, then the my character seems to get stuck in moving to the left direction. It also happens for the other 3 directions. Is that a known issue Is there anyway to fix it without changing craftyp  pIt happens here with firefox 29 and chrome 34. My code is pretty much the one in the final version presented at the tutorials end its not the same, but even when it was the same I already had this issue.p  pBy the way, when this happens, if I CTRLTAB out and back again holding that left key, things go back to normal the movement stops.p  pQ2 The isometricish features interprets Z as being height, and the gravity component uses Y for height. Isnt this a problem Can I, maybe, for example, tell gravity to use something else, other than y, for heightp

Negative 359 pIve been using the lightbox gallery widget on my website to create picture galleries. But it opens the image in a new window instead of in a lightbox. It works fine on a blank site, but not on any of my webpages. My guess is that there is a conflict with some other javascript file Ive used my pages use javascript for spry menus and for a responsive side menubar that shows up on smaller screen sizes. I havent changed any code for the lightbox and have allowed dreamweaver to insert the stylesheets and scripts automatically. p  pIve looked up this problem and I dont seem to have any of the problems mentioned in other answers. All my images, stylesheets and scripts seem to be linked correctly. The gallery div has been linked to the correct classes. I cant seem to figure out where the problem is. p  pThis is one of the pages on website that uses the gallery a hrefhttpruchikanambiar.comProjectsscenes.html

Negative 359 pI have sampled data in the interval [0,1] in an Array codetransitionszeros101,101code which I want to plot as a 3Dhistogram. codetransitionscode is filled with data similar to the example data provided at the end of this thread.p  pThe first columns refers to the first observed variable codeXcode, the second column to the second variable codeYcode and the third column is the normalized frequency. I.e. for the first row the observed normalized frequency of the variable pair code0,0code is 0.9459. The sum of the normalized frequencies for code0,Ycodethus is code1code.p  pI tried to make sort of a 3D histogram with the following codep  precode        xc  transitions,1  1001         y  transitions,2  1001         z  transitions,4         A  zeros10,10         A  zerosmaxxc,maxy         for i  1lengthxc             try                     ifzigt0                         Aint32xci, int32yi  abslogzi                     else                          deal with exceptions regarding log0                         Aint32xci, int32yi  0                     end             catch                 disp             end         end         bar3A codepre  pHowever, since it is sampled data in a discrete space codeAcode the output looks like the plot below.

Finding solution on google made me know that A was made the primary project and the settings of A are being used by B by default and I dont know how to go about this. Any help will be appreciated.p

Negative 359 pIm using SpriteKit for my game, and would like a type of perpixel physics. In iOS 7, I think the only way to do this is with the codebodyWithPolygonFromPathcode method. My images are a bit complicated though, so, instead Id like to create a more basic shape of my image then create a path from that alpha image.p  pIs is possible to turn my image in to a CGPath to use for the physics bodyp  pI know in iOS 8 there are APIs to do this, but I want my game to run on iOS 7 too.p

Negative 359 pIm creating listeners for when a channel is read, and when a channel writes in Netty. Listeners are handled in the Bukkits event system, thats not the problem, the problem is thread safety. The Bukkit Api is run on the main thread and must be in sync or basically the server will explode. Netty is run on multiple threads, so cross communication can be hard with the Bukkit api. I asked on the Bukkit forums and the best answer i got was to create an AtomicBoolean and have a while loop, this would solve the problem with syncing the cancellation of the sending and writing packets but it doesnt fix the problem of changing the packet that is being sent written. when an event is called in Bukkit the listeners are called from each class, under EventHandler. all of that code must be in sync with the main thread, Im not to sure how i would use synchronized in this scenario. sorry for the bad code formatting i cant work this system very well.p  precodepublic class ConnectionInjector extends ChannelDuplexHandler       private User user     private Channel channel     private PacketRecieveEvent recieve     private PacketSendEvent send     private boolean isInjected  false     private boolean isClosed  false      public ConnectionInjectorUser user          this.inituser.getPlayer          public void close          if this.isClosed              this.isClosed  true             if this.isInjected                  getChannel.eventLoop.submitnew CallableltObjectgt                      Override                     public Object call throws Exception                           getChannel.pipeline.removeConnectionInjector.this                         return null                                                          this.isInjected  false                                 public boolean isInjected          return this.isInjected           public boolean isClosed          return this.isClosed            Override     public void writeChannelHandlerContext context, Object packet, ChannelPromise channel          if this.isClosed             throw new IllegalStateExceptionConnection closed already                  PacketData d  new PacketDatapacket         send  new PacketSendEventuser, dthe event         Bukkit.getScheduler.scheduleSyncDelayedTaskMain.getInstance, new Runnable              public void run                  Bukkit.getPluginManager.callEventsend runnable puts it on the main thread                      end of bukkit thread back on netty         if send.isCancelled this possible happens before the above code which is very bad             try                  if send.getPacket.getRawPacket  null                     throw new IllegalStateExceptionsent packet was null   send.getPacket.getRawPacket.getClass.getName                                  super.writecontext, send.getPacket.getRawPacket, channel possible happens before send is even created.              catch Exception e                  e.printStackTrace                                 Override     public void channelReadChannelHandlerContext context, final Object packet throws Exception          PacketData p  new PacketDatapacket         recieve  new PacketRecieveEventuser, p         Bukkit.getScheduler.scheduleSyncDelayedTaskMain.getInstance, new Runnable              public void run                  Bukkit.getPluginManager.callEventrecieve                                 if recieve.isCancelled             super.channelReadcontext, recieve.getPacket.getRawPacket                      public void injectfakePacketObject packet          if this.isClosed             throw new IllegalStateExceptionInjector is closed                  this.getChannel.pipeline.contextencoder.fireChannelReadpacket           public void initPlayer player        this.channel  Channel Nms.getNetChannelplayer         this.channel.pipeline.addBeforepackethandler, epickitpvp, this         this.isInjected  true           public Channel getChannel          if this.channel  null             throw new IllegalStateExceptionchannel is null                  return this.channel        codepre

As a test case I wanted to draw a blue quad on the background image.  p  pI have looked at several resources and SO questions to try get the information I need to accomplish the task  e.g. a hrefhttpnehe.gamedev.nettutorialyourfirstpolygon13002 relnofollowthis tutoriala for first primitive rendering, a hrefhttpwww.lonesock.netsoil.html relnofollowSOIL examplea for texture loading . p  pMy understanding was that the texture will be drawn on Z0, and quad as well. Quad would thus cover a portion of texture  be drawn on it, which is what I want. Instead the result of my display function is my initial texture in blackblue colour, and not my texture  in original colour  with a blue quad drawn on it. This is the display function code p  precodevoid display void   glClearColor 0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0 glClear GLCOLORBUFFERBIT   background render  glMatrixModeGLPROJECTION glLoadIdentity glOrtho0.0f, 1024.0, 512.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.f  window size is 1024x512  glEnable GLTEXTURE2D   glBindTexture GLTEXTURE2D, texture   glBegin GLQUADS glTexCoord2d0.0,0.0 glVertex2d0.0,0.0 glTexCoord2d1.0,0.0 glVertex2d1024.0,0.0 glTexCoord2d1.0,1.0 glVertex2d1024.0,512.0 glTexCoord2d0.0,1.0 glVertex2d0.0,512.0 glEnd  here I get the texture properly displayed in window  glDisableGLTEXTURE2D   foreground render  glLoadIdentity gluPerspective 60, GLfloatwinWidth  GLfloatwinHeight, 1.0, 100.0  glMatrixModeGLMODELVIEW  glColor3f0.0, 0.0, 1.0  glBegin GLQUADS glVertex2d400.0,100.0 glVertex2d400.0,500.0 glVertex2d700.0,100.0 glVertex2d700.0,500.0 glEnd  now instead of a rendered blue quad I get my texture coloured in blue  glutSwapBuffers   codepre  pI have already tried with many modifications, but since I am just beginning with OpenGL and dont yet understand a lot of it, my attempts failed. For example, I tried with pushing and popping matrices before and after drawing the quad, clearing the depth buffer, changing parameters in gluPerspective etc.p  pstrongHow do I have to modify my code so it will render the quad properly on top of the background texture image of my 2D scene strong Being a beginner, extra explanations of the modifications  as well as mistakes in the present code  and principles in general will be greatly appreciated.p  pbrstrongEDITstrong  after answer by Reto Koradi  brp  pI have tried to follow the instructions, and the modified code now looks like p  precode foreground render  glLoadIdentity glMatrixModeGLMODELVIEW  glOrtho0.0f, 1024.0, 512.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.f glColor3f0.0, 0.0, 1.0  glBegin GLQUADS  same from here on codepre  pNow I can see the blue quad, but it is not displayed properly, it looks something like this img srchttpi.stack.imgur.comkOC1B.png altlike this.p  pBeside that, the whole scene is flashing really quickly.p  pstrongWhat do I have to change in my code so that quad will get displayed properly and screen wont be flashing strongp
Negative 359 pHistorically Ive only ever used CQ 5.6, but am now working on a project using 5.3 and am failing to get a servlet registered and accessible.

Negative 359 pI havent been able to find anything on this yet, so forgive me if this question has already been asked in some other form.p  pIm using AngularUIRouter as my preferred routing method with Ruby on Rails 4 as my backend API. Im building an app that is userbased as in there will be hundreds  thousands of users. Each user has their own account that houses their information and it can be edited. Each user already has an authenticationtoken that they receive when they log in that is generated serverside, stored in the database, and then stored clientside as a temporary cookie while logged in.p  pWhat I have done for account authorization is define whether a state requires an authorization check during the state resolve, and then if it does I check if the users state ID param matches their user ID set as a cookie AND if their authenticationtoken cookie is identical to the authorizationtoken defined in the API.

Im using the Restangular module to make the HTTP requests and this code is used in the apps top level run cycle its an init file.p  pWhat Im wondering is whether or not this is a valid solution, what the potential drawbacks or security flaws may be, and if this is a bad idea, what is a more effective solution for accountbased authorization within AngularJSp  pThanks in advancep  precoderootScope.onstateChangeStart, function event, next, toState       Restrict access if authorization is required from state data authRequired is defined in module config files as part of the state definitions     if next.data.authRequired          Auth.getCurrentUser.thenfunctionuser                Validate the users token by checking if the authtoken cookie matches the users API authtoken             var usertoken  user.authtoken             var authtoken  cookieStore.getauthtoken             var validateAuthToken  function                  return authtoken  usertoken  true  false                            Validate the users ID by checking if the uid cookie matches the ID of the state param that is being requested.             var uid  cookieStore.getuid             var sid  parseInttoState.id             var validateUserID  function                  return uid  sid  true  false                            If either validation is false, restrict access             if validateAuthToken ampamp validateUserID  false                  event.preventDefault                 if Auth.isLoggedIn  true                       user is not allowed                     state.gohome                     alertService.showAlertAUTHEVENTS.notAuthorized, alertdanger                  else                       user is not logged in                     state.goauth.login                     alertService.showAlertAUTHEVENTS.notAuthenticated, alertdanger                                                codepre

Negative 359 pFirst, the motivationp  pIm building an app that could benefit from, but does not absolutely require, Android services obtained via the codeAccountManagercode. That being the case, Ive built my app without the codeGETACCOUNTScode and codeUSECREDENTIALScode permissions, opting instead to build a codeServicecode plugin for authorization, which the user can optionally install. Now, this plugin works entirely as intended except for one glaring issue I can start the codeIntentcode returned from codegetAuthToken...code that asks for initial authorization, but I cannot wait for it to complete.p  pSo, now that it is known why I want to call codegetAuthToken...code from a codeServicecode instead of an codeActivitycode, does anyone know how I can wait for the authorization codeIntentcode to complete before returning a token Basically, in the code below, does anyone know how to hold off on returning codetokencode until codeauthIntentcode completesp  precode... AccountManagerFutureltBundlegt accountManagerFuture accountManagerFuture  accountManager.getAuthTokenaccounts[0], android, true, null, null Bundle authTokenBundle  accountManagerFuture.getResult if authTokenBundle.containsKeyAccountManager.KEYAUTHTOKEN     token  authTokenBundle.getStringAccountManager.KEYAUTHTOKEN.toString else if authTokenBundle.containsKeyAccountManager.KEYINTENT      Intent authIntent  Intent authTokenBundle.getParcelableAccountManager.KEYINTENT     authIntent.addFlagsIntent.FLAGACTIVITYNEWTASK     context.startActivityauthIntent     ...      I know that I wouldnt set token here this is just to emphasize      that I want to set it after authIntent completes     token    codepre  pAlso, if its of any use to know, the code above is located within an codeAsyncTaskcode. Itd be ugly, but maybe I could poll codegetAuthToken...code until it no longer returns an codeIntentcode I have to believe theres a better solution than that, though.p

Negative 359 pOpenShift swiftly addressed the SSL Poodle vulnerability around October 16th 2014.  Since then the ecommerce provider I work with can no longer establish a secure HTTPS connection with my OpenShift PHP application.  I suspect this is, at least in part, because SSL3 is no longer an available protocol.p  pThe error logged at the ecommerce provider end isp  precodejavax.net.ssl.SSLException java.lang.RuntimeException Could not generate DH keypair codepre  pHeres what Ive tried and discovered so farp  pThe online SSL testing tool at a hrefhttpswww.ssllabs.comssltest relnofollowhttpswww.ssllabs.comssltesta indicates my SSL Certificate is installed correctly installed via the OpenShift WebConsole, and it receives an A grade.  HTTPS works fine when connecting to my OpenShift PHP application in a normal web browser.  In general the SSL Certificate amp installation itself seems fine.p  pAs a test, I have tried using OpenShifts shared SSL Certificate instead of my own, with exactly the same result.p  h3Java 7h3  pThe remote ecommerce platform that is attempting to connect to my OpenShift PHP app via HTTPS uses Java 7.  Tech support thinks the issue is that their Java 7 system doesnt support cipher key lengths  1024 bits.  Unfortunately theyre not in a position to upgrade their system to Java 8 at present, so their hands are a bit tied.p  h3Handshake Simulationh3  pThe ssllabs analysis of my SSL Certficate includes a useful Handshake Simulation test with various clients.  This actually shows a Java 7 simulation connecting OK using TLS1.0, however the Java 6 simulation fails with a Client does not support DH parameters  1024 bits error  roughly echoing what ecommerce tech support is seeing reported by their Java 7 based system.p  pHow might I solve this  To narrow the question down a littlep  pIs there a simple adjustment my ecommerce provider could make at their end to enable HTTPS connections to OpenShift applications, without them having to upgrade Java or make significant changes that could impact others  e.g. An option to accept DH parameters  1024 bits.p  pIs there anything I can adjust at my end perhaps an OpenShift or PHP setting to enable their Java 7 based system to establish a HTTPS connection with my OpenShift application successfully  e.g. An option instructing OpenShift to provide DH parameters lt 1024 bits.p

Negative 359 pI am trying to implement a DSL that has to translate to a already implemented model. The DSL will describe instances of the classes from the given model, so it is inappropriate to use a DSLGenerator, parsing the DSL to javafiles. I would like to load the described instances into javaruntime. From an architectural perspective i need a DSLLoader class that translates the DSL into instancingstatements and loads the instances into the java runtime. It is possible to do this with the provided DSLGenerator. However it seems to be realy ugly. Are there other, in this situation more appropriate, possibilities to process the AST into a instancemodelp

Negative 359 pI have to automate a scenario in Selenium in which I am required to pick values from an excel file and then to input that in the login fields of the webpage. There is a check to be placed in the first value to be picked, which I am unable to complete.p  pSuppose I am picking up values 103030, from the first row, first column. Now this is a six digit number. The webpage field where I am supposed to enter this checks for a minimum 9 digit number.p  pSo, if it is a six, or a seven digit number, I have to concatenate leading zeros for the remaining places.p  pFor example,in this scenario, 103030 is a 6 digit number, and it requires three more digits to become a 9 digit number. So I have to add three leading zeros to this like 000103030. Similarly if it is a seven digit number like 1030303, then I have to add 001030303.p  pHow can this be achieved. p  pThe way I thought it can be achieved is by finding the number of digits, subtracting that by 9 and then replacing the required number with zeroes, but Im struggling with the logic for adding leading zeroes.p

Negative 359 pIve been given a design library from a large cooperate client built utilizing Bootstrap 3 and Require.js. Its very robust and wellbuilt with the various scripts using Require.js to load jQuery. Problem is, Drupal has already loaded jQuery and the double load is causing some items to fail. If I remove all the Require.js calls, Drupal jQuery stuff works great. If I remove the base Drupal jQuery file, all the stuff using the Require.js stuff works great.  Here are options I have consideredp  ol liStop jQuery from loading with Drupal, use require to load jQuery on every page  I havent tried this yet, but it just seems wrong. I think I can remove jQuery with hooklibraryalter in my theme Wondering if anyone has tried this My front end and admin screens actually use 2 different themes, so I think Id have to modify both. li liStop jQuery from loading with Require.js  I tried this and none of the other libraries that are loaded with require.js can find query if its not loaded with Require.js, so I dont think this option works.

Negative 359 pI created a json parse with a simple adapter to shows the result. Everything works fine but i need to retrieve an url to convert in bitmap. Its a listview, so the url isnt one but could be one,two,three or more. For each url i need create a bitmap so i can show an image for each element of the list.. Actually, before the getView method part i can display in a log the urls correctly. As soon as i enter in the getView the only url i can show is the last one i parse from json.

Negative 359 pI am storing enums for things such as ranks administrator, moderator, user... and achievements for each user in my Mongo database. As far as I know Mongo does not have an enum data type which means I have to store it using another type.p  pI have thought of storing it using integers which I would assume uses less space than storing strings for everything that could easily be expressed as an integer. Another upside I see of using integers is that if I wanted to rename an achievement or rank I could easily change it without even having to touch the database. A benefit I see for using strings is that the data requires less processing before it is used and is more human readable which could help in tracking down bugs.p  pAre there any better ways of storing enums in Mongo Is there an strong reason to use either integers or strings trying to stay away from a which is better questionp

Any suggestions to achieve this will be really appreciated.p

Negative 359 pSo, Im codemalloccodeating a variable, something like this in a function in Cp  precodechar  foo foo  char malloc32  sizeofchar 1   some irrelevant to the variable code  function2ampfoo freefoo codepre  pAnd then, I copy a string into codefoocode in codefunction2codep  precodevoid function2char  foo       Some more presumably irrelevant code      strcpyfoo, asdf  codepre  pThis is part of a much bigger project a compiler. I wasnt able to reproduce this problem in a standalone C program, but stripping many of the variable dependencies, the above code seems ok.p  pMy problem is, that the call to codestrcpycode causes a segfault 95 of the times undefined behaviour the rest.p  pFollowing the execution with codegdbcode, I found that, up to this moment I can codeprint foocode and see an empty stringp  precodegdb s 1445         line of code right before call to strcpy gdb print foo  18  0x6064c0  gdb s 1455        strcpyfoo, asdf gdb codepre  pHowever, right before codestrcpycode is called, codeprint foocode gets me a code19  0x2a00000002 lterror Cannot access memory at address 0x2a00000002gtcode and right after, emmost of the timesemcodestrcpycode will throw the SegFault, or the string will be corrupted and cause the next codestrcpycode to throw the SegFault. Corruption is also random, as sometimes the pointer address will be intact with  gibberish characters, but sometimes code0x0code. The program may, occasionally, mess with other strings too, right at that point.p  pWhat causes that Is foo supposed to be freed before the call Probably not. Could some other piece of code mess with its memoryp  pThe strings seem to be properly allocated. I also tried with calloc, allocating right before the codestrcpycode call, different buffer sizes, copying 0s and copying from other buffers. Printing codefoocode, right after codestrcpycode, emsometimesem prints random gibberish, emsometimesem exactly what I expect it, and emsometimesem nothing at all.p  pstrongEDIT 1strongp  pI was only able to quantify it to thisp  pRemoving the codestrcpycode call in codefunction2code, I see on codegdbcode that the codefoocode variable has an address and value   0x606420, but as soon as the function call returns, the pointer in the main function, points to code0x0code and that makes the next call to codestrcpycode SegFault.p  pTrying to emulate the problematic codefunction2code doesnt work. The code in codefunction2code, while extensive, does not touch, at any moment, the parameterafter removing strcpy, of course.p

Negative 359 pWe have a site where users can search for service providers customers looking for service providers.  The site currently has a MySQL zipcode search doing a classic radius around the latlong point of the searched zipcode, matching all zipcodes whose latlong are within the radius circle of the searched zipcode. Then matching all service providers which put their address in one of the matching zipcodes.p  pSay a user is searching for service providers within 25 miles. Service providers that are 50 miles would normally not show up in this search. However, we want to give service providers the option to enter a radius for which they server. Even if they are 50 miles away, they may have a service radius of 100 miles  so this user would appear in the 25 mile radius search.p  pBasically drawing a radius circle around two points and seeing if they intersect.p  pAny ideas I have no idea where to start here or if something like this is possible or even advisable.p  pOur fallback will be to allow service providers to enter zipcodes they serve but this is a bit more cumbersome for service providers.p

If its too different, it must be from another burst, it needs to go into a new folder, along with any of the following images that are similar to it, and so on.p  pMy thought is to add up the absolute value of the difference between each pixel of the current image, and the next one.

Negative 359 pI have a simple app with several ViewControllers for which I need to know from which VC I come from when I am in a VC except the first one. All VCs are created in the storyboard and I navigate through VCs with the code below p  precodeclass FirstVC UIViewController          func ShowStartVC              if gFirstStart                      let vc  self.storyboard.instantiateViewControllerWithIdentifierEvalUserLevelVC as EvalUserLevelVC             self.presentViewControllervc, animated false, completion nil                  else                      let vc  self.storyboard.instantiateViewControllerWithIdentifierChoixLevelVC as ChoixLevelVC             self.presentViewControllervc, animated true, completion nil                    func ShowPrefsVC              let vc  self.storyboard.instantiateViewControllerWithIdentifierPrefsVC as PrefsVC         self.presentViewControllervc, animated true, completion nil         class FirstVCSceneClass SKScene      var VCFirst  FirstVC      override func touchesBegantouches NSSet, withEvent event UIEvent                  for touch AnyObject in touches                      let location  touch.locationInNodeself              switch self.nodeAtPointlocation.name                          case Start                 VCFirst.ShowStartVC                 self.paused  true              case Preferences                 VCFirst.ShowPrefsVC                 self.paused  true              default                 break                             codepre  pIn the code above the ChoixLevelVC can be called from here and from another VC exactly the same way and I need to know from which VC it has been called. My understanding is that the property presentingViewController should have this information when I access it from the ChoixLevelVC UIViewController classp  pBut if I put the below code in ChoixLevelVC everything is at nil although I would expect to find FirstVC in the property presentingViewControllerp  precodeclass ChoixLevelVC UIViewController, UICollectionViewDelegateFlowLayout, UICollectionViewDataSource      override func viewDidLoad              printlnParentViewController  self.parentViewController         printlnpresentingViewController  self.presentingViewController         printlnpresentedViewController  self.presentedViewController       codepre  pAnd it is the same in every VC.

However, With that code you are going to run DB query every time you fetch those 10 rows 20010 20 times for all rows.p  pWhat I need is to fetch all data at once, store them in a collection say codetaskscode,Then paginate the coderesulting collectioncode instead of fetching again from DB.p  pEven more, I need to query something like Get only 100 records and paginate them by 10  which would be nice if it would be something like p  precodeTaskstake100gtpaginate10  codepre  pbut unfortunately even that do not work.p  pAnyone with an idea on how to tackle these issuesp

Negative 359 pI have a payment system and I have a problem. I will try to provide a minimal example reproducing it.

Negative 359 pI have a Chrome packaged application that receives UDP packets containing audio data using a hrefhttpsdeveloper.chrome.comappssocketsudp relnofollowChrome.sockets.udpa and plays them using the Web Audio API. As you can imagine, this ends up being a pretty heavy load on the CPU, and I start dropping packets if I try to open up another Chrome window, which leads me to believe that once I start adding interactive UI elements Ill start running into problems. I wanted to pack up all this stuff nicely in a Web Worker to avoid that, but when I try to do so and declare codevar socket  chrome.sockets.udpcode in my Web Worker, I end up getting an codeUncaught ReferenceError chrome is not definedcode when I try to use it.

Negative 359 pThe standard way to get a random integer in the range [0, n in JavaScript  or any other language that only offers a random function that returns a float in the range [0,1  is to use codeMath.floorMath.random  ncode. p  pNow the math behind this is trivial assuming were operating on the set of rational numbers.

Negative 359 pI am writing a code to do some very simple descriptive statistics,  but I found myself being very repetitive with my syntax.  I know theres a way to shorten this code and make it more elegant and time efficient with something like a forloop, but I am not quite keen enough in coding yet to know how to do this... p  pI have three variables, or groups All data, condition 1, and condition 2. I also have 8 matlab functions that I need to perform on each of the three groups e.g mean, median. I am saving all of the data in a table where each column corresponds to one of the functions e.g. mean and each row is that function performed on the correspnding group  e.g. 1,1 is mean of all data, 2,1 is mean of cond 1, and 3,1 is mean of cond 2. It is important to preserve this structure as I am outputting to a csv file that I can open in excel. The columns, again, are labeled according the function, and the rows are ordered by 1 all data 2 cond 1, and 3 cond 2. p  pThe data I am working with is in the second column of these matrices, by the way. p  pSo here is the dumb, tedious way I am accomplishing thisp  precodex  cell3,8  x1,1  meanalldata,2  x2,1  meancond1data,2  x3,1  meancond2data,2   x1,2  medianalldata,2 x2,2  mediancond1data,2 x3,2  mediancond2data,2  x1,3  stdalldata,2 x2,3  stdcond1data,2 x3,3  stdcond2data,2  x1,4  varalldata,2    variance x2,4  varcond1data,2 x3,4  varcond2data,2  x1,5  rangealldata,2 x2,5  rangecond1data,2 x3,5  rangecond2data,2  x1,6  iqralldata,2   inter quartile range x2,6  iqrcond1data,2 x3,6  iqrcond2data,2  x1,7  skewnessalldata,2 x2,7  skewnesscond1data,2 x3,7  skewnesscond2data,2  x1,8  kurtosisalldata,2 x2,8  kurtosiscond1data,2 x3,8  kurtosiscond2data,2    write output to .csv file using cell to table conversion  T  cell2tablex, VariableNames,mean, median, stddev, variance, range, IQR, skewness, kurtosis writetableT,descriptivestats.csv codepre  pI know there is a way to loop through this stuff and get the same output in a much shorter code.

Negative 359 pI have a grid that shows the world and its coastlines. An excerpt from the area around the UK is shown here a hrefhttpi.stack.imgur.commWoul.jpg relnofollowimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.commWoul.jpg altCoastline grid around UKap  pFrom an arbitrary origin point anywhere in the ocean, I want to find those coastline points that are in line of sight of the origin without having to cross another coastline point. For example, if the origin is on the west side of the UK, I would expect to get many coastline points of western Ireland and western UK but not from Denmark as it is covered by the UK. p  pI need advice on a fast algorithm that can shoot out rays and detect where those rays cross the first coastline coastline map is available in binary format.p  pAlternatively, I could imagine to move along all coastline pixels, build the connecting line between the origin and the coastline point and check if there is no other coastline point on the connecting line. Does any algorithm comes to mind that could accomplish this check of coastline crossing efficiently p  pI realize this question is a shot in the blue but maybe there is someone smart who has knowledge in this area.

Negative 359 pI have an object that I read out of my DB like thatp  precodeBestellung bestellung  db.Bestellung.Firstx gt x.ID  id codepre  pThen I set in my object a nullabule timestamp to DateTime.Now the timestamp is only to see if someone already called the object and when.after that I write it back to the DB with db.SaveChanges. The result is that I get a validation Exception. I guess it has something to do with the fact that it is a nullubule timestamp but am not sure.p  pDoes someone have an idear why it comes and how to fix itp  pThanks in advancep
