Positive 363 pIm using OAuth for login in my Laravel Controller. Its working fine but the thing is when the user is registered for the first time, I wanna trigger the HTML 5 geolocation API to fetch the users current location and do some mixpanel stuff. Earlier I was using AJAX in the JS for the login so there was no such problem but now that Ive implemented a complete server side solution, Im stuck with this one problem.p  pThe Laravel Controller code looks something like this  p  precode       function callback            fetch the access token and graph data           ifres  AuthmjAuthenticatefacebook, fbData                                     user  AuthscopegtgetUser                                            return Redirecttoevents                           if AuthmjRegisterfacebook, fbData                   user  AuthscopegtgetUser                                                        return Redirecttoevents                           return thisgthandleFailureSome Problem Occured          codepre  pThe Earlier JS Code was  p  precode             ajax                 .postauthlogin,                      data                          oauthprovider facebook,                         oauthtoken accessToken                     ,                     cache false                                  .donefunctiondata                                                                     mixpanel.trackUser Logged In,                          id data.resource.id,                         provider Facebook,                         email data.resource.email,                         firstname data.resource.firstname,                         lastname data.resource.lastname                                          if data.msg  Resource registered                        ifnavigator.geolocation                        Prompt for Allow Deny Geolocation popup.                                                               codepre

The problem is that I dont know where to put the receivedResponse method. How do I do this I prefer to put it inside customelement, but then I dont know how to bind it to the onresponse event of ironajax.p  pI could bind the data to a property of customelement and have an observer for that property, but that feels like a hack and Id like to find out the correct way of doing this.p
Positive 363 pI am currently working on a form for a retail outlet where in I need to submit form on enter keyup and redirect the form to the same page. On enter keyup the ajax post is being submitted to a php function and on successful data insert I am doing a page redirect. Which I am able to do currently, but in few instances the users are hitting the enter key multiple times may be 3 to 4 times in a sec because of which the for is being submitted multiple times. How do I prevent multiple submission. Have tried to generate a random number and pass as session token but, each submission is generating a new random number.

Positive 363 pIm very new to JavaScript very new to programming, learning Django, JQuery and JavaScript at the moment.  Anyhow, Im trying to write an JS function to allow a user to click an element in the DOM which creates an input field so the user can dynamically change the text contents of the element.  Ill then be sending a JSONAJAX request to alter the contents of the database to reflect the change.p  pIve got it mostly working however noticed a minor issue.  Im binding 3 events to the function keyup, focusout and keydown.  Im trying to capture each key as they are pressed to dynamically update another element in the DOM to reflect the change as its typed, when the user clicks away from the input and also when the enter key is pressed.  Clicking away and triggering for each key press works a treat, however pressing return has caused me an issue. I had to add the keydown event to capture this.  What seems to be happening though is that all three events are triggering i.e. my AJAX POST is sent three times.  Cannot work a way around this issue.  Tried a few things i.e. disabling event bubbling, however Im very new to JS so a little out of my depth and resolving this issue.  Thanks in advance to any answers posted.  Below is the JS ive written, probably no the most efficient, Im sure in time Ill learn how to streamline it more.p  pHow can I ensure the function on runs once when the enter key is pressed p  pThanks in advance, code below.p  precode track key pesses on menu name being updated  document.onkeydown keyup focusout,.nameinput,functionevent    added to try and fix multiple AJAX requests, doesnt seem to work though    event.cancelBubble  true   var levelurl   var menuid  parseIntthis.attrmenuid   var menuroot  this.attrmenuroot   var el  subrelative  menuid   var input  this   if menuroot.length  1     levelurl  pagesajaxrequestmenu      else     levelurl  pagesajaxrequestsubmenu        strip unwanted characters from the input    input.valinput.val.replace[AZazampd]g,     if event.type  focusout  event.which  13     event.preventDefault     .ajax       url levelurl,       type POST,       data id menuid, action modifyname,        dataType json,       success functiondata         if data.status        add stuff once backend AJAX stuff is finished                                  else                 infomodalTitle.htmldata.title           infomodalBody.htmldata.message           infomodalFooter.htmllta hrefjavascriptlocation.reloadtruegtltbutton typebutton classbtn btnsuccess btnxsgtReload Pageltbuttongtltagt           infomodal.modalshow                   apparently should stop event bubbling but doesnt.

Negative 363 pIm developing another java web framework for personal use, and in addition to that I also want to develop somekind of persistence framework.p  pI have already developed and engine that in order to access the table, you must only extend a class and create your fields with the same type and name of those in the table. Exp  precodeprivate int id private String nome codepre  pSo you only need now to build the query and execute. The engine put the values on the right fields.p  pRecently Ive had a quite good experience with Django, wich in order to update, create and filter the table you just need to call .save, .createfield1field, field2213 and, .filterfilterfieldvalue.p  pI want to build this to, but I am having some trouble, because the extending class would actually have to write more, fact that I dont want to force. I have had the idea to the extending class write an enum implementing an Interface.

Negative 363 pI really like the way ASP.NET MVC works. Id love to implement it on all new web projects moving forward, but I hit a snag in a prototype the other day that I really havent found a good solution for, so I ask you, how would you design an MVC app that doesnt fit the typical REST pattern As an example, the prototype I was designing would have several pages, but the pages themselves arent necessarily bound to a domain model. For example, take a simple registration site, which might have the following pagesp  ul liDefault.aspx   li liRegister.aspx  li liThankYou.aspxli ul  pOccasionally, such a program might require an admin section to deal with such details as moderating sign ups or reviewing data. In a standard ASP.NET web app, I might add the followingp  ul liAdminDefault.aspx  li liAdminListRegistrations.aspx  li liAdminViewReports.aspx   ...li ul  pWould it be an unacceptable deviation from the MVC pattern, in this case, to have two controllers such asp  ul liHomeIndex  li liHomeRegister  li liHomeThankYou  li liAdminIndex  li liAdminListRegistrations  li liAdminReportsli ul  pMy frustration with this is compounded by the fact that there is no real solid implementation of subcontrollers and areas yet. Im aware of the Areas prototype put together by Phil Haack, but its not very mature, and quite frankly, Im not sure I like the way its setup, but I dont really know how Id like to see that work either.p  pI guess when I think MVC, I tend to think REST as well, and having controller actions that represent pages rather than actual entities or actions doesnt sit right with me. What do you thinkp

Negative 363 pIm running the labs in MCTS 70536 Training Kit chapter 11 about Code Access Security. Im running XP Pro. The first lab creates an assembly which checks for different permissions and reports a message if they exist.

Negative 363 pIs there an easy way to invoke a GWT RPC service endpoint directly from Java code  I mean real Java code, not Java code compiled down into javascript.p  pI ask because we want to run performance benchmarksstress tests against a GWT RPC interface.

However, I cant really find any code in the GWT runtime that demonstrates how to cleanly do this.  Ive looked at the com.google.gwt.user.client.rpc package but the stuff in there seems to use JSNI which obviously wouldnt be usable by pure Java.p

Negative 363 pI know the basic difference as codeReleaseComObjectcode only decreases some counter by one and codeFinalReleaseComObjectcode decreases it to zero. p  pSo what I usually hear is, call codeFinalReleaseComObjectcode because then you are sure that the COM object is really released. p  pBut this makes me wonder, there is a point to this counter right Arent you breaking that mechanism if you always call codeFinalReleaseComObjectcode. If that counter is not emoneem before you call codeReleaseComObjectcode, is there not probably a reason for itp  pWhat could cause it to be higher than one when it should not bep  pThanks in advance.p  pPS My COM experience only consists of using Excel Interop. Not sure if this question is local to that domain i.e. outside Office Interop, codeFinalReleaseComObjectcode is not often used.p  h2Update 1h2  pThe a hrefhttpblogs.msdn.comvcblogarchive20060920762884.aspxarticlea Dan mentioned talks about using codeReleaseComObjectcode when youre done. As I understand from the a hrefhttpblogs.msdn.comvcblogarchive20060920762884.aspxarticlea, this is the normal way. I think that if you do this consistently it should work fine. In a comment to the a hrefhttpblogs.msdn.comvcblogarchive20060920762884.aspxarticlea the author suggests someone to call codeReleaseComObjectcode in a loop until it is really released the a hrefhttpblogs.msdn.comvcblogarchive20060920762884.aspxarticlea is from 2006, so this is analogues to calling codeFinalReleaseComObjectcode. But he also states that this could be dangerous. p  blockquote   pIf you really want to the RCW to call Release at a particular point in the code, you can call ReleaseComObject in a loop until the return value reaches zero.  This should ensure the RCW will call Release.  However, if you do that, be warned, when the other managed references try to use that RCW, it will cause an exception.p blockquote  pThis leads me to believe that it is indeed emnotem a good idea to always call codeFinalReleaseComObjectcode, as you can cause exceptions elsewhere. As I see it now, you should only call this if you are absolutely sure that you can.p  pStill, I have little experience in this matter. I dont know how I can be sure. If the counter is increased when it should not be, is it not better to fix that problem If so, then I would say codeFinalReleaseComObjectcode is more of a hack than a best practice.p

Negative 363 pEDIT I stuck in a single call to manually retain the array right after initializing it, and that fixed it. Dur. Thanks.p  pI keep an NSMutableArray in a UIScrollView subclass, and I add to it instances of a UIImageView subclass as each is added as a subview. It needs to be a mutable array, as I plan to rearrange their order in the array eventually this bug is occurring before I even try to do so. Ive used NSLogs to show that the array has count 10 up until and including applicationDidBecomeActive is called in my AppDelegate, and added a timer to fire every 0.001s in the run loop. The first time it fires, it cant find the array anymore Im very confused and have been trying to track this down for hours.p  pThe timers working properly i.e. when printCount doesnt access the array, its fine, its only when I try to access the array there that it breaks. The regular call to printCount below works, but the first time the timer fires I What could possibly be happening between these two calls to printCountp  precode voidapplicationDidBecomeActiveUIApplication application      NSTimer timer  [[NSTimer scheduledTimerWithTimeInterval0.001f                                                        target[viewController view]                                                      selectorselectorprintCount                                                      userInfonil                                                       repeatsYES]                       retain]     [[NSRunLoop currentRunLoop] addTimertimer forModeNSDefaultRunLoopMode]     [[viewController view] printCount]  codepre  pIve been endlessly stepping through the program with the debugger. The array is correct right up through this point, and its memory address is the same even after its contents are changed. However, there is only object in it afterwards  its 10 elements get replaced by a single UITouchData instance. No idea where it comes from. None of my eventhandling methods attempt to reassign the array or change it. Any ideas what could be going wrong Im completely mystified.p

Negative 363 pIm new to Android.p  pI am drawing bitmaps, lines and shapes onto a Canvas inside the OnDrawCanvas canvas method of my view. I am looking for help on how to implement smooth scrolling in response to a drag by the user. I have searched but not found any tutorials to help me with this.p  pThe reference for Canvas seems to say that if a Canvas is constructed from a Bitmap called bmpBuffer, say then anything drawn on the Canvas is also drawn on bmpBuffer. Would it be possible to use bmpBuffer to implement a scroll ... perhaps copy it back to the Canvas shifted by a few pixels at a time But if I use Canvas.drawBitmap to draw bmpBuffer back to Canvas shifted by a few pixels, wont bmpBuffer be corrupted Perhaps, therefore, I should copy bmpBuffer to bmpBuffer2 then draw bmpBuffer2 back to the Canvas.p  pA more straightforward approach would be to draw the lines, shapes, etc. straight into a buffer Bitmap then draw that buffer with a shift onto the Canvas but so far as I can see the various methods drawLine, drawShape and so on are not available for drawing to a Bitmap ... only to a Canvas.p  pCould I have 2 Canvases One of which would be constructed from the buffer bitmap and used simply for plotting the lines, shapes, etc. and then the buffer bitmap would be drawn onto the other Canvas for display in the Viewp  pI should welcome any advice  p  pAnswers to similar questions here and on other websites refer to blitting. I understand the concept but cant find anything about blit or bitblt in the Android documentation. Are Canvas.drawBitmap and Bitmap.Copy Androids equivalentsp

Also, when he swipes from right to left, I want a previous timer to show.p  pThis is what I have done so for. I have a timer activity. I have added a touch event on it.

Negative 363 pWe are building web applications for the iPhone that work offline. But we are having difficulties caching dynamic images. Please read on and Ill show by example exactly what I mean and what we have done so far.p  pSo for example lets say we are building a simple list application with just 1 page. The applications only purpose is to list 5 items, each item containing some text and 1 image.p  pThe application has a simple logo and some separate JavaScript and CSS code. These strongstatic resourcesstrong are cached using the cache manifest file.p  pThere are 2 scenariosp  pstrongScenario 1 Im online and I open up the web applicationstrongp  pWhen I load the list application in Safari it will fetch 5 new random items out of a database containing 1000s of items. These are all served by simple backend through a AJAX call JSON format.p  pThe whole JSON object containing the 5 items is immediately stored in HTML5 local storage and cached for offline usage.p  pStructure of the JSON object is a bit like thisp  precode     0           id 3,         text Some text about item 3,         imageurl httpwww.domain.comimage22341.png     ,     1           id 23,         text Some text about item 23,         imageurl httpwww.domain.comimage442321.png     ,     2           id 4,         text Some text about item 4,         imageurl httpwww.domain.comimage2321.png     ,     3           id 432,         text Some text about item 432,         imageurl httpwww.domain.comimage2441.png     ,     4           id 43,         text Some text about item 43,         imageurl httpwww.domain.comimage221.png       codepre  pAs you can see, very simple may be some errors in that JSON, the whole JSON object is stored in local storage.p  pNow the 5 items are rendered using JavaScript injected HTML styled using CSS, nothing fancy. Span tags containing the text and image tags pointing to the image resource are created etc.p  pIn online mode, it all works great.p  pstrongScenario 2 Im OFFLINE and I open up the web applicationstrongp  pThe page loads the logo is displayed because it was cached as a static resource using the cache manifest, some JavaScript detects that we are indeed offline and the application as a result does not attempt to contact the backend. Instead it reads the previously stored JSON object from local storage and commences rendering the 5 items. All as anticipated.p  pText is displayed fine, but this time, the images are not displayed, reason for that is simple, the image tags are pointing to image resources which are not available. So it displays that little image not available icon.p  hr  pNow my question is, is there any way to cache those image resources somehow So that next time we need them, they are fetched from cache.p  pThis is what Ive triedp  ul liBase64 encode the images and supply them through JSON. This works BUT, it dramatically increases both fetching and rendering time we are talking about 30 seconds increase, very slowli liSome cache manifest hackingtrial and error.. couldnt find anything that works ideally need a policy that does cache all resources on domain as they are requested, but to my knowledge this does not existli ul  pI have literally spent hours on this and cant find a solution... does anyone have a clue I know this is possible because if you look at the Google Mail HTML5 application for the iPhone, they can somehow cache the attachments and you can retrieve them even while offline.p  pThe one thing we havent tried is using the SQLite databases that are supported by Safari... maybe I could store the images as a BLOB still means fetching it from the feed and thus slow and then somehow magically converting that into an image on the screen.... but I have no idea on how to do this.p  pAny help is appreciated, thanks.p

Negative 363 pI have used unsalted md5sha1 for long time, but as this method isnt really secure and is getting even less secure as time goes by I decided to switch to a salted sha512.

Here are the two possible codesp  pstrongAppend every timestrongp  precode some nice big salt salt  hashalgorithm, salt   apply algorithm runs times for slowdown while runs      string  hashalgorithm, string . salt, raw   return string codepre  pstrongAppend oncestrongp  precode add some nice big salt string . hashalgorithm, salt   apply algorithm runs times for slowdown while runs      string  hashalgorithm, string, raw   return string codepre  pI first wanted to use the second version append once but then found some scripts appending the salt every time.p  pSo, I wonder whether adding it every time adds some strength to the hash.

Negative 363 pWe are in the process of developing an method of caching so that our app can continue to operate in an area with very littleno signal.  Obviously users will try to continue to use functions that require data and we need to handle the inevitable failure of these requests appropriately.p  pEssentially we are sat in the office, switching airplane mode on and off to simulate enteringexiting signal then adjusting our app to fix any issues this may arise.p  pWhat Id like to know is, strongis using airplane mode going to give us a reasonable simulation of enteringexiting an area with no data or are there other implicationsstrong  p  pIve seen a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions4592150monotouchwebrequestconnectionfailsafterswitchingoffairplanemodeoniphonquestionsa raising the issue that the 3GEDGE connection may not always wake up after airplane mode is switched on  while I appreciate this method is strongno waystrong as good as actually being out in the field testing, if we can get a reasonable simulation and account for the majority of the problems that arise then I think this is an acceptable tradeoff. p  pI apologise if this has been asked before, I did do a search on here amp on google but couldnt find any appropriate results. p
Negative 363 pI found a very nice URL regex matcher on this site a hrefhttpdaringfireball.net201007improvedregexformatchingurls relnofollowhttpdaringfireball.net201007improvedregexformatchingurlsa . It states that its free to use and that its cross language compatible including Javascript. First of all, I have to escape some of the slashes to get it to compile at all. When I do that, it works fine on Rubular.com where I generally test regexes, with the strange side effect that each match has 5 fields 1 is the url, and the extra 4 are empty. When I put this in JS, I get the error Invalid Group. I am using Node.js if that makes any difference, but I wish I could understand that error. Id like to cut back on the unnecessary empty match fields, but I dont even know where to begin diagnosing this beast. This is what I had after escapingp  precodexib[az][w]1,3[az09]wwwd0,3[.][az09.][.][az]2,4[sltgt][sltgt][sltgt][sltgt][sltgt][s[].,ltgt]  codepre

Negative 363 pI have an algorithm that calculates the amount an object has rotated. p  pIt calculates between 180 and 180 degrees to deal with both clockwise and anticlockwise. However when the rotation is just about 180 degrees, due to rounding it ends up detecting a mix of 180 and 180 degree rotations when comparing different parts of the shape, depending on how rounding occurs this throws the actual rotation out by quite a bit. The answer to this would be to use the absolute value however this ends up breaks rotation direction.p  pHere is the code p  precode double newAngle  objOneAngle  objTwoAngle  if newAnglelt 180      newAngle  360  else if newAngle gt 180      newAngle  360 codepre  pAny thoughts on the best way to enhance the above code to deal with 180 degree rotationsp  pEDIT The most obvious method that comes to mind is to split up the positive and negative values, and then choose the best set, based on size or some other metric, but there must be a simpler more elegant solutionp

Negative 363 pIve seen simple tab bar projects created with and without .XIB files, but in both cases still using the interface builder. I must admit, i have had more success without the .XIB.  In the examples without the nib, the user enters the class that each of the tabs references in the inspector. In these examples the programmer has deliberately not created the .XIB file, and the .XIB name is left blank in the inspector  What is the rational behind this , and what is considered a better method  Also,when i experiment using the .XIB method i find i can not have the mainWindow.xib and any other .XIB on the screen at the same time. How do you overlay them purely to get an idea of how it will look on the interface builder Is it a setting thing, a bug, or am i misunderstanding something This particular issue is hindering me a bit in the use of nibs and tab bars  I really want to understand whats going on here, can somebody helpp

Negative 363 pI am trying to build a Windows 8 metrostyle app that will operate as a app killer.  For those of you who have used Win8 Tech Preview youll notice that once you open a metrostyle app you cannot close it without going into Task Manager and ending the process.  p  pMy challenge is that I cannot access System.Diagnostics.Process from my metrostyle app, nor do I know if there is an comparable alternative within the WinRT.  I also thought of building a separate app that hosts a service for my metro app to interface with, but Id like to do this with a single app. p  pFundamentally, I am looking for a pattern for building Metrostyle apps that leverage .NET 4.0 components, specifically to be able to enumerate and kill other processes running on the PC. p  pstrongCLARIFICATION I am less concerned with this specific application than I am with access that type of .NET functionality within a Metrostyle appstrongp  pThanksp
Negative 363 pI am currently trying to build a small system that reads in a bunch of file names at the moment, only a few hundred, and then allows the user to search the file names. The end goal is to find dulicates, ones that will not necassarily have the exact same names, but will share common words. I would eventually like to add a feature that allows it to suggest possible duplicates as well.p  pCurrently I add each file path to an ArrayList, and then pass each word of the file name to a Hashtable which uses chaining. The words are created using codeString.splitcode, and all non alphanumeric characters are converted into white spaces. This part works fine, and you can search for single words no worries.p  pI know the theory behind searching multiple terms, getting the response and building a basic relevance on how many time it selects each document.p  pMy current issue is with file names that are something akin to this mybestfile. My program can only handle them as a single word. and unless searching for mybestfile you will find nothing.p  pCan anyone suggest a design path that I should head down from here. I know I could parse in an entire dictionary, then try and pull words out by matching substrings, but to be honest, this is just meant to be a simplistic program and Id rather avoid that kind of thing.p  pAny help would be appreciatedp  pAlso the point of this is half learning, half proving I can do it, so I would like to know of solutions that already exist, but more for how they did it, rather then using them insteadp

Although sizeofchar is guaranteed to be 1, I know the real size of char may be different in different computer. It may be 8bits,16bits or some other size.

Does Client sends 8bits and Server wants to receive 16bits If it is true, what will happenp  pAnother question Is it good for me to pass text between client and server because I dont need to consider the big endian and little endian problemp  pThanks in advance.p

While opening access connection saving data into tables and closing db is taking time and server go haywire  If i dont use access db i can get huge messages with no problem.p

Negative 363 pI am writing a C program that essentially works with very large arrays. On Windows, I am using VirtualAlloc to allocate memory to my arrays. Now I fully understand the difference between reserving and committing memory using VirutalAlloc however, I am wondering whether there is any benefit in committing memory pagebypage to a reserved region. In particular, MSDN a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibrarywindowsdesktopaa366887vvs.85.aspx relnofollowhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibrarywindowsdesktopaa366887vvs.85.aspxa contains the following explanation for the MEMCOMMIT optionp  pActual physical pages are not allocated unlessuntil the virtual addresses are actually accessed.p  pMy experiments confirm this I can reserve and commit several GB of memory wihtout increasing memory usage of my process as shown in Task Manager actual memory gets allocated only when I actually access memory.p  pNow I saw quite a few examples arguing that one should reserve a large portion of the address space and then commit memory pagebypage or in some larger blocks, depending on the apps logic. As explained above, however, memory does not seem to be committed before one accesses it thus, Im wondering whether there is any real benefit in committing memory pagebypage. In fact, committing memory pagebypage might actually slow my program down due to many system calls for actually comitting memory. If I commit the entire region at once, I pay for just one system call, but the kernel seems to be smart enough to actually allocate only memory that I actually use.p  pI would appreciate it if someone could explain to me which strategy is better.p

Negative 363 pI have a program that reads data from a .csv and creates a codemultimapcode.  Ive pasted a simple version below.  It works fine, but runs really slowly on exit i.e., once the program prints out the output and gets to codereturn 0code.  Im working relatively big files, e.g., anywhere from 50 to a few hundred megabytes.  The delay on exit is, unsurprisingly, proportional to the file size.  p  pIm wondering if there is any way to speed up the exit  My guess is that its slow because its clearing data from memory.  codeCTRLccode in a terminal window shuts it down immediately, though.

Negative 363 pGood day.  First, let me warn you My knowledge of XML is basic, so I may have found the correct answer in my research and just not understood how to apply it.  p  pI currently have some C code that reads a National Weather Service XML file and looks for text in an element to decide whether or not there is a weather alert.

Negative 363 pIm developing a simple CMS, where admin should be able to configure main menu item positions, adding new items, deleting others, etc from admin panel.

Negative 363 pI am just getting into XNA programming and have been unable to figure out how can I access the texture from a .x model.  I am using a custom shader to display my model just a cube with a texture mapped on it with the filters set to point. To do this I needed to pass the effect my texture file which needed to be imported separately from my model or else it would complain since it is included in my model as well.  This works perfectly how I want it, however this isnt really an agreeable method when I have many different models with their own textures.p  pstrongMy question isstrong p  pHow am I able to access the texture included in my model directly from it and send that to my shader Or am I able to access it directly with HLSL p  pstrongWhat I have triedstrongp  pI have found posts saying that it can assigned to a texture variable with p  pcodeTexture2d texture  BasicEffectmodel.Meshes[0].Effects[0].Texturecodep  pWhen I tried this the game runs but the cubes are just black.  I can see that the texture variable is holding info and has the right dimensions but I cant tell if it is correctly holding the actual image. When I used just the codeBasicEffectcode they rendered just fine with their texture.p  pstrongUpdatestrongp  pI have managed to get this to work after a little bit of fiddling. My game loads in a few hundred of the same cube and upon creation of each it would try save the texture of the model using the code above and then go through the mesh parts and change the effects to my custom effect. I discovered that the first cube created would save the texture okay but any subsequent cubes created would complain that they cant be cast as a BasicEffect. This resulted in one textured cube and then a lot of black ones. I am guessing that when it reuses the same model over and over like that it will just use the one that was modified to use my custom effect which was done on the first instance of the cube.  Is this normal  I have got them all to render as textured by changing the texture variable to static.p

Negative 363 pIm having issues with an API Im developing. I want to have an array of classes, each of which implement the same interface and have static methods. I will have another class that will cycle through the array of classes and pick one based on the return value of one of the static methods, but the compiler is removing the static methods and the javascript encounters a TypeError when it tries to call the static method. Ive tried searching several forums, but I cant find anything that helps. This error only happens in advanced compilation mode, not simple, and even happens in advanced compilation in debug mode.p  pI am thinking this is because the compiler doesnt realize I am using the function because of the complicated way I am calling it.p  pI have put together a somewhat simplified example of what I am trying to do that causes an error.p  pSee below for the codep  pThe codeRacercode interface is an interface that is implemented by two classes codeRunnercode and codeJoggercode. The interface has one static method called getModesOfTransportation that returns an array of the ways that racer can move, and an instance method, called getTransportationModes, that does the same thing. This file also defines a custom type, coderacing.RacerClasscode, that I think makes a type that is a function that returns a racer object when called with the codenewcode keyword. I formed this based on a hrefhttpsdevelopers.google.comclosurecompilerdocsjsforcompilertypes relnofollowhttpsdevelopers.google.comclosurecompilerdocsjsforcompilertypesa. I would think that I should define that the type also has a static method, but I cant figure out how.

Negative 363 pThere is quite a few questions here about Transactions and JUnit. But please have a read through this before discarding it as i cant find anyone with the same issues.p  pI have a buisness method, annotated codeTransactionalcode. Within this method i will be doing a programaticly rollback if some special condition occurs. codeTransactionAspectSupport.currentTransactionStatus.setRollbackOnlycodep  pNow lets not get into a discussion about if a programaticly rollback is good or bad. Lets just accept its there, and accept its going to stay there and work with it.p  pIf I fire up my application and test this buisness method the old fashioned way, then everything works perfectly. When stuff is supposed to be rolled back, it is rolled back and when everything is ok, then everything is ok. And I also did a test without the codeTransactionalcode just to see that nothing gets rolled back, even when it should.  Everything works as planned.p  pBut the issues im having is with JUnit. Currently I have 2 JUnit tests of this method. 1 that should fail and trigger a programaticly rollback and one that is successfull without rollback.p  pI have tried a lot of different setups of my Junit class. Currently it looks like thisp  precodeRunWithSpringJUnit4ClassRunner.class ContextConfigurationlocations  classpathspringTestContext.xml, classpathspringTestContextdao.xml TransactionConfigurationtransactionManager  txManager public class MyManagerTest extends AbstractTransactionalJUnit4SpringContextTests      Mock     private ProductDao productDao      InjectMocks     MyManager myManager  new MyManagerImpl      Before     public void setup          MockitoAnnotations.initMocksthis           Test     public void testUnParsableXml          String xml  adlsfas         Response response  myManager.processXMLContentxml         assertFalseresponse.isSuccess         System.out.printlnresponse.getResponse        ServicemyManager public class MyManagerImpl extends BaseManager implements MyManager      TransactionalreadOnly  false, propagation  Propagation.REQUIRESNEW     public Response processXMLContentString xml          NB.

Negative 363 pIm going to try and ask this in a different wayp  pThere are plenty of SO questions about GUIUI development in Android and from what I understand since I am using Eclipse unfortunately couldnt use PhoneGap or I think this would be a whole lot easier I have to edit XML files to change my GUIUI. If that is the case is the way most of you doing it is designing your programs in photoshop, and then somehow you splice it so you can work with it using XML Thats what I dont understand I am using the editor provided with Eclipse, but I dont want to just have basic boring boxes and text fields. I was hoping it be easier to customize than this.p  pLike basically is there really no other way to do this than by hand alter xml code and see what works and what doesnt Im using ADT instead of DroidDraw so Ive already created my buttons, etc that wasnt a problemp

Negative 363 pI have implemented a simple tilebased collision system in my topdown game, but I am having problems with moving across corners. Currently, my programs takes the players center point and works out a tile on a 20px square grid the alternating grey cbackground. It checks the up, down, left and right tiles for collisions, and if it finds one, it moves onto the next stage.p  pThe next stage is to check where the player is within the tile. For this, I have a function called codegetCenterDistanceFromCurrentTilecode creative name, I know. This returns a Vector2i x and y of the distance from the center point of the tile, to the center point of the player. I then use this in the following waysp  ul liIf there is a wall tile to the left, and the players x distance lt 0 the player is to the left of the current tiles centerpoint, the player is moved to the x of the tile next to the wall.li liIf there is a wall to the right, and the players x distance is  0 right of the current tiles centerpoint, the player is moved to the x of the tile next to the wall.li liThis continues for the Y axis in the same way.li ul  pMy problem is with diagonal. I do not check diagonal collisions currently, but it appears I will have to. I have already made an attempt to implement it, but the player jumps around when they hit a corner.

Negative 363 pIve got actually my employer has a mobile website that enables Safari integration for iPhones and iPads  meaning that customers can bookmark it to their home screen and then it would behave as a standalone web app no address bar, custom icon, startup image etc.p  pIt works all right except that one week ago coincidentally soon after apple has released iOS 6.1.2 some of our customers 6 of them initially complained that they no longer get the normal content but a 404 page of a public wifi provider The Cloud owned by Sky here in the UK. After a bit of investigation weve figured that at some point those customers connected to the Cloud wifi without actually logging in its one of those providers that would redirect you to a login page to enter your credentials, after which you can carry on browsing. The thing is that even after switching back to their private wifi or mobile data connection the application would display the Clouds page.p  pThis only happens as far as I can tell when the application is launched via the bookmark I couldnt see this behavior when using it from safari.p  pWhat happens is that the customers would connect to the cloud wifi without logging in, they would open the application at which point the router will issue a redirect response to their login page the application would cache the login page and it will always display it whenever using the bookmark again. Ive performed a capture when this happens and there are no requests being made at startup whatsoever.p  pEven weirder, in this situation, if removing the existing bookmark and adding a new one will show you the same cached page with the whole operation being performed away from the Cloud. Weve fixed this by adding a unique identifier to the URL each time we hit the bookmark screen this indicates that the web apps sandboxes are linked to the url, which is to be expected.p  pWhat were trying to achieve is to have the application properly recovering after the customer has moved away from the Cloud. But there doesnt seem to be a straight forward way to do this.p  pFurthermore theres a level of inconsistency in all of this  most of the times when the flow is performed I will see a 404 page a custom 404 page a hrefhttpsservice.thecloud.netserviceplatform relnofollowhttpsservice.thecloud.netserviceplatforma, but sometimes I would be properly redirected to the login page, in which case the application would not break.p  pMy assumption is that there is a weird race condition in the standalone web app application model causing the browser not to properly handle redirects and actually caching 404 pages.

Negative 363 pI have some functions which take very specific matrices with specific information loaded in using another function Ive made. Currently the matrices the function accepts are the normal R matrix type. However Id like to assign them as a different type or class so as to achieve easy input checking so the user cant throw any matrix into the function.p  pI figured the S3 method would be easy after seeing a few examples on the netp  precodemat1 lt matrixc110,ncol5  colnamesmat1 lt cONE,TWO,THREE,FOUR,FIVE  as.sdpmgdna lt functionx    classx lt sdpmgdna   returnx   mat2 lt as.sdpmgdnamat1 codepre  pThis appears to work in so far as if I return mat2 I see a matrix, and if I call it via indecies mat2[1,2] I get the right values I should get. However I cant be sure some things have changed  it is now described as sdpmgdna[10] i.e. it seems to ignore it has 2 dimensions, although doing the above and printing mat2 to screen shows it clearly does have 2 dimensions. Another odd thing is if I do codecolnamesmat2code they are returned. However if I try to find the colname of an individual column e.g. codecolnamemat2[,4]code then the value returned is codeNULLcode. Can anyone explain why this is or what I should do  I really want it to basically be a matrix, but because the functions require it to be very specific in terms of a matrix of what and how big, defining it as another class would make error and input checking so much easier  and allow me to use the methods mechanism of R so all my custom plotting functions could just be methods of plot.p

Negative 363 pFor a university assignment, we have to investigate the various solutions to the knapsack problem, and then implement a solution in both Haskell and Python.p  pI have chosen brute force. I realize there are better algorithms, but the reason for this choice is beyond the scope of this post.p  pHowever, in both my attempts, I end up with a control stack overflow when using HUGS, but not when using GHC.p  pInvestigation seems to point to a problem regarding strictnesslaziness, where my code ends up generating an excessive amount of thunks, and it seems that GHCs strictness analysis is removing the problem.p  pCan someone point out where I am going wrong in the code I have provided below, and give me a lead on how to go about fixing the issue.p  pNote I have only 4 weeks experience with Haskell, so realize my code will be naive compared to that written by Haskell experts.p  pEdit Adding a few codeseqcode statements in has made the program work in HUGS. However, it seems like a bit of a hack. Are there any other possible improvements I have accepted an answer but any further advice would be appreciated.p  precodemodule Main where import Debug.Trace import Data.Maybe  type ItemInfo  Double,Double type Item  ItemInfo,[Char] type Solution  ItemInfo,[Item]   FilterTerminationCondition should be a function that returns True if this branch of brute force should be stopped. type FilterTerminationCondition  Solution gt Bool   FilterComparator should return which, out of two solutions, is better.

Negative 363 pWe are working on a game in cocos2d in which there is a possibility of getting a trivia question. The trivia question is implemented as a new, transparent CCLayer on top of the gameboard, which contains a CCMenu with all of the questions.p  pOur problem is that we cant seem to get the touches to stop propagating properly. When the trivia menu is up, players should not be able to click on the roll dice button on the board layer.p  pWe have tried implementing this by calling codedice.isTouchEnabledNOcode right before adding the trivia layer, but we cant figure out how to reenable the dice button.p  pWe also tried changing codeccTouchBegancode from NO to YES to always consume all of the touches, but then it stops responding to our menu. It seems that this should be the right way to do it, but why did the menu stop responding thenp  pOur professor suggested implementing a callback function, which we of course can do, but it seems like it should be easier than that.p  pDoes anyone have any suggestionsp

Negative 363 pI currently have a Mobile Application that communicates through a WCF Service to access a Database. The Mobile App can access on the network as well as externally. It connects to the WCF Service which is hosted on one server inside the network. From there the WCF Service is pointing at another server which is hosting the Database that the Mobile Device is accessing.p  pWith the above process how would you setup authentication using Active Directory which would confirm  the user of the Mobile Application before it can access the WCF Service to confirm that the user is a member of AD and they can then login after authorization is complete. This would occur as the user opens up the Application. Would this be coded into the App to prompt for the information, then send the information to the WCF Service which would then allow access If not this then are there any other ways or informationlinks that can be provided pleasep

Negative 363 pthe question has already been asked by someone but I couldnt find any complete answer. Ive written a ListActivity a list of monuments with an ArrayAdapter. Bitmaps are loaded in background, saved in cache, in DB, in disk and then returned. The user can change the elements in the adapter with a click, so the method setListAdapter is called several times.p  pIn the ListActivity the only thing is done, right now, is ask the server or the DB for a list of places, and call setListAdapter on an adapter with that places.p  pIn the method getView of the adapter, the only thing I have is calling a method loadBitmap.. that does everything in background, and populate the ImageViews of the listView with the bitmaps.p  pEverythings working fine, but I want to use a ListFragment instead of a ListActivity for many reasons first is that this list will be placed in a ViewPager, as a tab.p  pWhat do I have to do Can I use the same adapter or I have to change something in therep  pThank you very much,p  pLorenzop

This is so the soldier will keep both weapons in his storage. codeoutputPrimarycode and codeoutputSecondarycode takes the variables codeprimaryWeaponcode and codesecondaryWeaponcode from within Soldier and just outputs important information. However, the problem arises upon deleting primary and secondary, I get a core dump. I no longer use primary or secondary in the program so I am confused as to why I get such a result. p  pI have tested though that if I declare primary and secondary outside the for loop and delete them at the end of main, no problems arise.

Negative 363 pWe are currently trying to implement workflow functionality in our product .NET 4.5. For this we consider using Microsoft Workflow Foundation 4.5. However in this early stage we bumped into a technical problem of something that seems very doable. p  pSimply put this is what we want to achieve in our clientserver setupp  ul liBased on a specific event the server starts a workflowli liThe workflow executes some actions until it comes to an activity that requires human interaction. It should then wait for a message from a client. li liOne client there are multiple clients becomes the owner and therefore should send its unique id or address to the workflowli liThe workflow sends a message to that client indicating that it requires information to continue e.g. email parameters like recipient, subject and bodyli liAfter several minutes could be a few minutes to a few hours the client sends the information to the workflow so that it can continue e.g. send the email messageli liIf another human interaction is required, the server sends a request message to the client again so that it knows it should ask the user for information and then the client sends a message to the workflow again like aboveli ul  pFor what I understood a normal workflow does not have an endpoint to receive messages. A workflow service on the other hand does, but with WF services the workflow instances would be created based on the incoming requests rather than having the server be in control of the creation of workflows right. p  pAt this moment it appears to me that we need a combination of a workflow and a workflow service. p  pIve been struggling with this for a while now and searched high and low but cannot find useful information about it. p  pI think we have two optionsp  ol lipWorkflow services If we would use workflow services, we could have a Receive activity at the beginning of the workflow that starts the workflow. However, then how can clients communicatate with that specific workflow A workflow service has one specific URL. pli lipWorkflows A normal workflow that is hosted by a server application seems the most natural path to choose. However, then we need a way to send data to it. So, is it possible to upgrade a normal workflow so that the Receive activity can be used And if so, how And how do messages end up in the right workflow instancepli ol  pMy questions are Does anybody have some useful guidance or information on how to solve the above problem Are there interesting alternatives not using WF to accomplish this Does anybody have documentation about how WCF messages are routed to the correct workflow instance in WFp  pPS We have a WCF service available on the client. A workflow can communicate with that. For short running requests that isnt a problem, but the thing is that requests can take a long time before the client answers them. Also, the client can only request the information if the user clicks on a continue button the users should not get a popup just in the middle of something because the server wants informationp

The additional roundtrip doesnt make sense since they can be served at page load to make the app perceived as faster when theyre already cached. The issue here is that you still need to define a Rails route to match every route on Angulars side otherwise Rails will return a 404. p

Negative 363 pI need to write a program that performs a parallel search in a large space of possible states, with new areas being discovered and their exploration started in the process, and exploration of some areas being terminated early as intermediate results obtained elsewhere eliminate a possibility of discovering new useful results in them. The search is performed using multiple threads running in a heavy cooperation with each other to avoid recalculation of intermediate data.p  pA complex internal state including call stacks of several threads and state synchronization primitives they use has to be maintained and updated during the whole process, and there is no apparent way to split the computation into isolated chunks that can be executed sequentially, each saving and passing a small intermediate result to the next. Also, there is no way to split the computation into independent parallel threads not communicating with each other, without imposing a prohibitive overhead due to recalculation of large amount of intermediate data.p  pBecause of the large search domain, the program would possibly run for months before producing a final result. Hence, there is a significant risk of power, hardware or OS failure during the program execution that can lead to a complete loss of all work that has been done to the moment. In such a case the program will need to restart all its computations from scratch. p  pI need a solution that can prevent a complete data loss in such cases. I thought of an execution engineplatform that continuously saves the current state of the process to a failureresistant storage like a redundant disk array or database. But I understand that this approach can significantly slow down the process, even to a degree when there would be no benefit compared to an expected computation time including restarts due to possible failures.p  pIn fact, I do not need an ideal solution that emcontinuouslyem saves the program state, and I can easily bear a loss of hours or maybe even days of work. A possible heavyweight solution that comes to my mind is to run the program inside a virtual machine, saving its snapshots from time to time, and restoring the machine after a possible host failure from a recent snapshot. This approach can also help to recover the program state after a random or preventable guest OS failure.p  pIs there a similar, but more lightweight solution limited to preserving a state of a single process Or could you suggest any other approaches that can solve my problemp
Negative 363 pI am currently implementing arrows in my force layout as is done in this example a hrefhttpbl.ocks.orgmbostock1153292 relnofollowhttpbl.ocks.orgmbostock1153292a and that works perfectly. However, one will quickly realize that the location and size of the arrows are hardcoded here since the nodes never change size.p  pI have a graph were I dynamically change node sizes, and as such I would like the arrows to update accordingly since otherwise they are covered by the node or cover the node or are just not attached to the node.p  pThere is only one post I have found a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions15495762linkingnodesofvariableradiuswitharrowsrq1linking nodes of variable radius with arrowsa that talks about this issue. However, it was not answered, and the answer that one poster gives of having the edges end at the radius of the node rather than the center is not something I want to do. It would require constantly recomputing edge positions, which given the number of edges I have is not practical.p  pI thought this would be relatively simple but havent been able to figure it out. The change that I a currently working on is moving the marker creation below the generation of the nodes, since otherwise there is no ability to get node size data unless I want to run the size method I am using, which would be a massive waste of processing power I have hundreds of nodes. p  pWhat I am trying rough example, my code is a bit more complex  p  precodevar path  svg.appendsvgg.selectAllpath     .dataforce.links   .enter.appendsvgpath     .attrclass, functiond  return d.target.nodeID   var circle  svg.appendsvgg.selectAllcircle     .dataforce.nodes       .enter.appendsvgcircle     .attrr, nodeSize Dynamically determine size     .callforce.drag   Pernode markers, as each node could potentially have a unique size svg.appendsvgdefs.selectAllmarker     .datanodes, functiond  return d.nodeID    .enter.appendsvgmarker     .attrid, functiond  return d.nodeID      .attrviewBox, 0 5 10 10     .attrrefX, functiond  return d.r  Offset by the radius of the node     .attrrefY, 0     .attrmarkerWidth, 6     .attrmarkerHeight, 6     .attrorient, auto   .appendsvgpath     .attrd, M0,5L10,0L0,5  Now that we know radius data for nodes, add the arrows in path.eachfunctiond       d.attrmarkerend, functiond  return url  d.target.nodeID     codepre  pDoes anyone have an idea about the best way to go about this Thanks in advancep  pstrongUpdate per request, I have created a jsfiddle a hrefhttpjsfiddle.netherbstmbj5wJ7 relnofollowhttpjsfiddle.netherbstmbj5wJ7a.

I am not sure exactly how the camel routing framework itself is helpful to my project if one already uses spring but I do like the vast amount of data format support that it provides. p  pI am using the latest version of camel 2.11.1 and spring 3.2, see relevant parts of projects belowp  pstrongConfigstrong hibernate,transaction jpa removed for simplicityp  precodeConfiguration

I want to start developing some rudimentary games to help teach my some basic programming in C amp C but i dont want to have a copy of visual studio express installed to take advantage of XNA.  p  pCan this be done with Visual Studio 2012 on Windows 7p
Negative 363 pI have a question. Im learning about the activity lifecycles in Android at the moment. I had some trouble with the orientation change of the device.p  pIn my particular case I have an activity with a quite complex datastructure. As I dont like the retained fragment method to pass this object to the new created activity, I will use the deprecated codeonRetainNonConfigurationInstancecode method, because I feel its more light weight. Is there a big disadvantage to use thisp  pAnother thing I did experience is, that when I have an activity and views, for example TextEdits defined in the layout XML in my case and I write something and then cause an orientation change, the TextEdits keeps its state the text written in, even though I didnt care for it. How can that be explainedp

Negative 363 pWe need to design a server that will serve a webpage to several clients but also query a remote database for these clients. One of the requirement for this project is that the whole system must be compliant with the REST architecture style. We need use Java as programming language but many questions arised while we were designing it.p  pWe want to have a main thread that will get connections, as shown in this examplep  precode System.out.printlnStarting a new web server using port   port      try          ServerSocket reciever  new ServerSocketport         while true              try                  Socket s  reciever.accept                 Client c  new Clients                     catch IOException e                  System.err.printlnNew item creation failed.

If the request is a GET, then the thread will serve the resource to the client. If it is a POST, then it will add the request to a buffer and let another thread handle the query to the database and also the answer back to the client. After handling this only request, the thread closes the socket and terminates. p  pIs the use of sockets violating the REST principle In order to respect the REST architecture, do we need to destroy every Client object thread amp socket after each HTTP message Is there another way of clientserver communication that does not use socketsp

In this example, an codeIntcode.p  pThat is, if you had codemyObjectcode with the standard casting function codetoIntcode declared, then calls like codeIntmyObjectcode would just work.

Negative 363 pFirst, it is my strong opinion that the terms emcheckedem vs emuncheckedem exceptions are imprecise, as it descriptively misleads who is doing the checking or if the checking is voluntary. Therefore I would be using the following terms in this question, so that people not aware of the difference might chip in an answerp  ul liCheckmandated exception  checked exceptionli liChecknotmandated exception  unchecked exceptionli ul  pstrongMotivation of Questionstrongbr I feel that the writers of standard Java utilities have committed misguided and inappropriate overdependence on exceptions. The utility that is of my particular attention is the Integer.parseintString utility method.p  ol liIt should not use a emchecknotmandatedem exception, because everyone who have used the util knows that the string supplied is often unknown and therefore, we would compel a try block anyway. Therefore, it is not a nonsalvageable situation.li liIf the writer of the utility had forced the use of emcheckmandated exceptionem, it still would be inappropriate because since you know that there is a high likelihood of exception, then dont make it an exception. Since by logical reasoning, what you do expect would happen cannot be linguistically called an exception.li liReserve use of any exception for actually critical issues.li ol  pstrongQuestionstrongbr If I am to rewrite the utility, to satisfy my annoyance against overuse of exceptions by utility writers, what would be the best way to go around this predicament That would treat unacceptable string, but satisfying my ideology against the overuse of exceptions. p  pMy immediate thinking to solving it would bep  ul liInteger parseString, Delegateli ul  pSince Java is debilitatedimpoverished by the absence of Delegates in the language, I would have it asp  ul liInteger parseString value, CallBack unacceptedParseCallbackli ul  pWherep  precodepublic interface CallBackltT,Sgt    T mitigateS value  codepre  ul liCallback can be null, but only then would a NumberFormatException thrown if Callback mitigation is needed but not supplied.li ul  pHowever, I doubt my quickanddirty solution is the best way of avoiding the use of exceptions.

Suppose that there is a codeShapecode classp  precodepublic class Shape      User user     int color  codepre  pand a codeUsercode classp  precodepublic class User      int mood  codepre  pNow suppose that a shapes color depends on the users mood. Is it redundant for codeShapecode to have a codecolorcode field since it can be calculated by accessing its codeusercodes moodp  pConsider that in a more realistic example accessing the necessary data to calculate the color can be more complex or via a longer sequence of accessors codecolor  user.getCat.getCousin.getMoodcode. Consider further that these classes may be mapped to a database and in a way duplicate data. On the other hand they can be marked as transient.p  pColor depends on the mood but color is not the same as the mood at all. So including codecolorcode field seems only logical to me, however I cannot wholly justify this design.p  pDoes a class variable have a right to exist if its value can be calculated using other datap

Negative 363 pMe and my friend are setting up to create applications for both PC and Android devices, of course wed like our name to get around a bit so wed need a website...  Now at the moment neither of us have a sturdy income of money either which is a problem for us just setting out, and I dont like debts so loans are not really a desirable option. p  pIm seaching for a free hosting soluton, that doesnt have intrusive ads. Its okay if it has some ads, as long as theyre not being thrown into users faces. Bandwidth isnt really important, as we arent expecting very much visitors in the beginning.p  pId also like forum abilities and some form of eblog solutions, not really fussed what eblogger wed have, storage space, Id say at least 200MB as wed need to store a few graphics to be used on the site and host a small amount of applications for download. The space is compromisable for now i.e if the other options are good from a provider I wont mind dropping some storage space.  I dont believe Ill be needing any database or SQL solutions, but of course its bonus.  An email server would also be desired, but as we can just stick with a third party email service for now, this is also not required.p  pIf there may be an optionspecific Ive left out, please do let me know.p  pThanks for your help  p  pEDIT I think my overall action would be to obtain several different providers, mainly consisting of the suggested, and create a quick spreadsheet so I can compare the differences to find a desired option. And also a few scenarios too.p

Negative 363 pIm working on a multiplayer game in Flash amp Nodejs for the server TCP.p  pIn Flash there is this stream behavior where if you do example socket.readUnsignedByte it will return the bytes from the stream from 0 position, and then it will get rid of it from the stream.p  pThe stream is all the data that is being sent from server to Flash, and it stays there until I read it. I can read it bit by bit not literally bit, whenever I feel like, and this is the behavior I want. I need to know how much data there is in the stream and be able to do things like readUnsignedInt.p  pFor example I got 0x01 0x0 0x0 0x0 0x0ap  pand I do .readUnsignedByte, it will return the 0x01, and the stream will change to 0x0 0x0 0x0 0x0a, and be reduced to the size of 4 bytes from 5 bytes.p  pSo Id be looking for something like stream.readUInt32...p  pIs there any library to accomplish thisp

Negative 363 pI hope this is not a recurring question, but i dont seem to find anything on what i am trying to do. I am to store a small data structure about 40 bytes in size on a flash memory of the microprocessor as a look up table. The device can be interfaced to the PC, so that the end user can configure this tablewithout being able to program the micro to suit the needs of his particular system. It would make sense to me to store it in an array and it would be convenient for me to access this data in code, however then i would need some way of forcing this array to point to a specific memory location. Section of flash where the table is to be stored is not really flash  but EEPROM and is configured and partitioned by me. Any ideas on how I could go about it  using kinetis K60DX256 micro, not much experience in storing data structures Thanksp

Negative 363 pScenario At Apigee Edge platform, A single App is associated with two API products where both products are associated with same API proxy. Differences among these API products are in product quota value and scope.p  pIn the above scenario, request is coming with a specified scope. Is it possible that Edge platform use the quota value of the product having scope as specified in the request p  pBased on my testing, quota value is picked from any one of these two products and so not able to enforce the quota value.p  pMy understanding is as API proxy is same in both API products quota values determined at runtime can be quota value of any one of these two products and that means quota values may not be enforced as required. So in such scenarios, possible solution is to assign same quota value to both products.

Negative 363 pIve inherited a messy ASP.net web application.  Last week, for the first time, we were supposed to push changes to the application to the production systems.p  pNo problem, right  Just follow the usual stepsp  pThis project has been published in the past with precompilation turned on.p  pI published the project using the exact same publish profile that was saved in Team Foundation Server.  I sent it to Mr. A, the person who has access to the production systems.  The next day, they told me that it wasnt working.  It works fine in my development environmentp  pMr. A told me that upon closer inspection, he noticed that in the old version, the bin folder contained numerous files with a .compiled extension.  In the new version, the only file with a .compiled extension is codeglobalasax.compiledcode.  I checked the settings and it clearly says that it is publishing with precompilation, so why are all these files missing from my publish directoryp  pAlso, and this may or may not be relevant, the exact error message indicates that the web site cannot read from a resources file.  The project is ASP.net WebForms, not MVC.p

Negative 363 pThis is killing me because I feel like Ive seen something around before, but my searches are coming up empty and I dont have various patterns committed to memory yet.p  h2The Situationh2  pI have a search grid that allows users to filter based on multiple attributes. The filters that users would like are passed in via a codeNameValueCollectioncode and parsed out.p  pCurrently, our legacy app checks for each potential filter in a separate if statement and then runs custom code. And since cyclomatic complexity just isnt my thing, 30 almost identical codeifcode statements bug me.p  h2Towards a Better Wayh2  pRather than continuing to check each item in a hardcoded way, Ive rewritten the parser so that now I can quickly obtain a list of all filters that will be applied. Im also refactoring the filters themselves into their own classes.p  pSo, I have a list of filters in string form Name, BirthDate, etc. and a bunch of classes codeNameFiltercode, codeBirthDateFiltercode, etc.p  h1The Questionh1  pWhat is a good, standard way to take a list of strings representing filter names and turn it into a list of those filter objects themselvesp  pI suppose I could do some sort of codeFilterLocatorcode with a codeLocateFilterstring filterNamecode method, but that seems like it would lead to one long switch statement and seems kind of blech.p  pI get the sense this is heading towards some sort of IoCDI solution, but that I dont know enough about either to fully realize it yet.p  pThanks for your thoughtsp

Negative 363 pI am aware of the homework policy and rest assured that I have put copious amounts of my own time into this assignment and I am not looking for someone to simply do my work for me. p  pI am a beginning Computer Science major with no programming experience before this class it is all about C programming, outside of a small amount of website development when I was younger. Im thoroughly enjoying the curriculum and have found myself to have a better understanding than most others in my class so far, but this assignment has me stumped.p  pThe assignment is to read in a text file of passenger names first and last initial, seats A1, B1, C1, D1, A2, etc., and ticket prices. The output is specified to be a table of passengers and their seats sorted by seat order, and I also have to print the minimum and maximum ticket prices along with the owner of each ticket, along with the average of all ticket prices. My arrays are all reading in correctly, and the minimum, maximum, and average ticket prices were all easy to find. My problem is the sorting. We were introduced to arrays a couple weeks ago and this is our first time doing any sorting. We are supposed to use a bubble sort, and while I think I gather how to use a bubble sort, its not working in my program so obviously I dont really know how to use it. I have tried several different things, and sometimes a few seatsnames will switch around never the way I want them to and sometimes nothing will happen at all.p  pAnyway, TLDR New to programming, not trying to get homework done for me, need to bubble sort airplane passengers and seats by seat order A1, B1, C1, D1, A2, etc. Thanks in advance for any help.p  pMy input looks like thisp  pA Z A1 555.55 repeat with different initials, seats, and prices however many times the user sees fit.p  pI have a 1D character array for the columnsA  D, a 1D integer array for rows 1 to maximum integer, 1D float array for prices, and 2D array for name initals.p  pHeres the function to read in the arraysp  precodevoid readArrayschar seatcols[], int seatrows[], char name[][LAST], float price[]  int i, j      fori  0 i lt SIZE i              forj  0 j lt LAST j                      scanf c, ampname[i][j]                    scanf c d f , ampseatcols[i], ampseatrows[i], ampprice[i]       codepre  pHeres the sort.

If there are no issues, I upload a new APK with an incremented version number for beta. If the beta passes testing with no issues, then I upload another APK with an incremented number for production. If an alpha or beta version had issues, I would fix them and upload a new alpha or beta version with a version number something like 2.1.1a2 meaning the second alpha.p  pThere seems to be a better way to do this by using the promote to beta or promote to production feature. The problem here is if an alpha is labeled as 2.1.1a1 and it gets moved to beta, it really needs to be called 2.1.1b1. This would require a new APK to be built which means I cant currently use the move to x feature.p  pHow can I change the version number to reflect what stage it is in after promotion be it alpha, beta, or productionp

Negative 363 pI have used the following site a hrefhttpwww.htmlmap.com relnofollowhttpwww.htmlmap.coma to create an image map for use on my site. Currently, when the user hovers over a continent they are presented with a link to a specific page however, there is no visual cue to indicate that the continent is a link. Ideally, there would be some sort of icon overlayed on top of the continent that would change colour or preferably the continent itself would be highlighted.p  pAs the latter would require SVG which is not supported in IE8, I have opted for the former although I think I am approaching it in completely the wrong way.p  pCurrently, I am overlaying an icon over the top of the image using absolute positioning but this means that the whole process of mapping my image in the first place has gone to waste as the link would need to be on the icon and not within the image map.p  pMy question is, how can i use the mapped areas I have already defined to overlay the icon for each continent whilst preserving the link behaviour.p  pIve tried embedding the span within the area tag but this doesnt work at all.

Negative 363 pNot sure how best to ask this question, so feel free to edit the question title if there is a more standard vocabulary to use here.p  pI have two 2column data tables in R, the first is a list of unique 2variable values u, so much shorter than the second, which is a raw list of similar values d. I need a function that will, for every 2variable set of values in u, find all the 2variable sets of values in d for which both variables are within a given threshold. p  pHeres a minimal example. Actual data is much larger see below, as this is the problem and obviously not created randomly as in the example. In the actual data, u would have about 600,000 to 1,000,000 values rows and d would have upwards of 10,000,000 rows.p  precode First create the table of unique variable pairs no 2column duplicates u lt data.framePC1c1.10,1.01,1.13,1.18,1.12,0.82,                 PC2c1.63,1.63,1.81,1.86,1.86,1.77   Now, create the set of raw 2variable pairs, which may include duplicates d lt data.framePC1sampleuPC1,100,replaceTsample90100,100,replaceT100,                 PC2sampleuPC2,100,replaceTsample90100,100,replaceT100   Set the threshold that defined a closeenough match between u and d values b lt 0.1 codepre  pSo, my first attempt to do this was with a for loop for all values of u. This works nicely, but is computationally intensive and takes quite a while to process the actual data.p  precode Make a list to output the list of withinthreshold  rows m lt list  Loop to find all values of d within a threshold b of each value of u  The output list will have as many items as values of u  For each list item, there may be up to several thousand matching rows in d  Note that theres a timing command system.time in here to keep track of performance system.time   fori in 1nrowu       m lt cm, listwhichabsdPC1uPC1[i]ltb amp absdPC2uPC2[i]ltb      m codepre  pThat works. But I thought using a function with apply would be more efficient. Which it is...p  precode Make the userdefined function for the threshold matching match lt functionx,...   whichabsdPC1x[1]ltb amp absdPC2x[2]ltb   Run the function with the apply command. system.time   m lt applyu,1,match  codepre  pAgain, this apply function works and is slightly faster than the for loop, but only marginally. This may simply be a big data problem for which I need a bit more computing power or more time. But I thought others might have thoughts on a sneaky command or function syntax that would dramatically speed this up. Outside the box approaches to finding these matching rows also welcome. p

Negative 363 pI have a project created from many external swc libraries that are included at compiletime.p  pNormally creating a preloader involves unchecking export in frame 1 on all classes, then having them on the 2nd frame so Flash can still access them.p  pWith the swcs however, all the classes are in separate swc file libraries. When I uncheck export in frame 1, I cant access them from the main FLA file, and so flash just cant find them and gives errors saying those classes dont exist. How can I make them loaded properly with the preloader instead of being loaded all at once before preloader displays, even though they are in other filesp  pLong story short, how can I properly make a preloader when Im using multiple swc files at compiletimep  pThanksp

Negative 363 pThis question deals with how the statements and those involving recursion are executed, and in what order Ruby will handle the,.  Specifically, as Ive been learning online, I have found that Ruby does not follow Last in first out convention in a stack form of memorymanagement, but rather has a garbage collector.

Negative 363 pI have two xbees series 1. I have them as endpoint devices working in API mode and talking to each other. The first xbee is attached at a raspberry pi, while the other is on my pc where I see the terminal tab of XCTU program. The baud rate I use is 125000.p  pFrom raspberry pi I try to send a jpg image which is 30Kbytes. I send data frames 100 byte long the biggest as it is said in the xbee documentation. Inside a loop I create and send the packets, I have also a codecoutcode statement that prints the loop number. Everything is fine and all bytes are sent. When I comment out the codecoutcode statement not all bytes are sent. p  pFrom what I have understood the codecoutcode statement works as a delay between packets, but I still cannot understand why is this happening as it is supposed that I use the half speed ... p  pI hope I was clear and look forward for a reply.p  pstrongUPDATEstrong Just to summarize, i changed baud rate to 250000 where there is the same behavior as in 125000. I also implemented hardware flow control by checking cts signal. When xbees are in transparent mode I need a delay between sending characters at around 150us. The same goes for api mode too. The difference with 125000 baud rate in api mode was that the delay needed, was enough to be betwween each data packet, but in 250000 the delay is needed between each byte that i send.  If i do the above everything goes well.p  pThe next thing i did was to plug both xbees in my pc in transparent mode. I went to terminal tab of xctu software where i chose assemble packet and sent at around 3000 bytes to the other xbee. The result was the same. The second xbee received at about 1500 bytes and then each time that i was sending one byte from the first to the second, the lost bytes were being received at packets of 1000.  p  pSo could anyone know what am I doing wrongp
Negative 363 pIm trying to crawl some data from Amazon Mechanical Turkey, where I could only view the first few pages of the result without logging in. It turned out that Amazon requires cookies to record sessions, so the simplest way that just submit a formrequest as many examples do wont work.p  pIve tried to pass some cookies around, though I thought scrapy will handle that automatically, but its not working. If I do openinbrowser after submitting the form, I get the amazon page saying that I should enable cookies in order to logging.p  pThen I came to another post where he uses selenium to get the cookies.

Negative 363 pPython, virtualenv and linux  noob to all 3.p  pI have a small python project which uses a downloaded package PyFPDF within usrlocallibpython2.7distpackages.  All worked fine.p  pIve read using virtualenv is a better way to go as it keeps projects and project dependent packages separate from each other and the main python system.p  pSo having set up virtualenv I now havep  pcodepythonprojectfolder                      py script file                      folder with some project related files                      env folder code code  ls envlibpython2.7sitepackages                                 folder fpdf amp fpdf1.7.2.egginfo                                 others too but not not relevant here codep  pHowever when I ran script I was getting a message about missing PIL.p  pI see PIL is actually located in original python setup. codeusrlibpython2.7distpackagescodep  pMy env setup has no distpackages folder at all  linked or otherwise which i thought was the whole point i.e. the env uses common system wide python packages but allows you to use project specific packages aswell.p  pIm further confused as to how my original set up worked since, as stated above, I was running from codeusrlocallibpython2.7distpackagescode which doesnt have PIL in it. p  pClearly I dont understand the subtle differences betweenp  pcodeusrlocallibpython2.7distpackagescode     no PIL andp  pcodeusrlibpython2.7distpackagescode           has PILp  pAnyway the long and the short is that to get my project running in env I have created a codeshortcutcode within codepythonprojectenvlibpython2.7code which links to codeusrlibpython2.7distpackagescodep  pThe script now runs perfectly but I cant help feeling Ive hacked it and I am not using virtualenv in the true spirit.p  pI hope my description is marginally clearer than mud.

The comment was in response to a different comment that speculated that putting a too large of a constant for codestdarraycode that is declared as a local variable could cause the program to abort due to insufficient resources for the stack allocated variable. I assume the followup comment meant that it would be possible for codestdarraycode to somehow switch to a dynamic allocation mode.p  pI could imagine that there could be some kind of SFINAE could be applied for an array size threshold that triggers a specialization of codestdarraycode that actually dynamically allocates an array and manages it.

Negative 363 pI have the following problem. I have a number represented in binary representation. I need a way to randomly select two bits of them that are different i.e. find a 1 and a 0. Besides this I run other operations on that number reversing sequences, permute sequences,... These are the approaches I already usedp  ul liKeep track of all the ones and the zeros. When I create the binary representation of the binary number I store the places of the 0s and 1s. So that I can choose an index for one list and one index from the other one. I then have two different bits. To run my other operations I created those from an elementary swap operations which updates the indices of the 1s and 0s when manipulating. Therefore I have a third list that stores the list index for each bit. If a bit is 1 I know where to find in the list with all the indices of the ones same goes for zeros.li liThe method above yields some overhead when operations are done that do not require the bits to be different. So another way would be to create the lists whenever different bits are needed.li ul  pDoes anyone have a better idea to do this I need these operations to be really fast I am working with popcount, clz, and other binary operationsp

Negative 363 pI am getting a weird error on my asp.net web form page. I have a legacy page built up with full functionality. It has got several data controls on the page. After performing required operations when I click on submit button, internet explorer goes blank. It says page cant be displayed. p  pMy code is old enough, so it actually works on few production sites. But recently I have deployed on a new production site. If I browse the same page using internal URL and perform same operation, it does not show any error message and everything works smoothly.p  pTo give a background for the issue, when I click on submit button it calls web service on backend and comes back with web services result. Once it gets results back, it uses response.redirect to same page by creating url  Request.Url.AbsolutePathwith some additional parameters in querystring. If I refresh page then it shows same page correctly.p  pPage in IE  img srchttpi.stack.imgur.comW46zn.png altenter image description here Page in chrome  img srchttpi.stack.imgur.comWP4x4.png altenter image description herep

Negative 363 pI have a 40 million x 22 numpy array of integer data for a classification task. Most of the features are categorical data that use different integer values to represent different categories. For example, in the column Color 0 means blue, 1 means red and so on. I have preprocessed the data using LabelEncoder.  1 Does it make sense to fit those data into any classification model in SKlearn I tried to fit the data into Random Forest model but got extremely bad accuracy. I also tried One Hot Encoding to transform the data into dummy variables, but my computer can only deal with a sparse matrix after using One Hot Encoding, the problem is that Random Forest can only take a dense matrix, which will exceed my computers memory.  2 Whats the correct strategy to deal with categorical data in SKlearnp

Negative 363 pSo Im relatively new at Python, and Ive been trying to learn PyQt. I wanted to create a menu dynamically based on the contents of a list.

Negative 363 pMy organization is working on a physical mapping and datastorage system which is meant to serve both internally and for the public. The databaseserver can be chosen more or less independently from the application itself, and the person responsible for providing the queries for the application prefers either Microsofts MS SQL TSQL or Oracle SQL PLSQL. Id rather do Postgre because of the spatial addin options well have but Im trying to be a teamplayer.p  pMS SQL is basically out because I would be more confident deploying on a Linux machine, and since VMsandboxed hosting is cheaper as opposed to dedicated or virtual private server VPS, installing ODBC drivers for TSQLcompatability without use of coderpmcode and codeyumcode strikes me as a waste of time.p  pThat makes picking a host for the databasecomponent fairly straightforward, except that I have no idea what strongOracle Table Space Size 100MBstrong really means. Thats listed by a few Oracle databasehosting providers and Ive gathered its a default of some sort. If this were the databases total size, obviously I would have reason for concern. If this were instead a limit on the size of an individual table within a single database, I would emstillem have reason for concern.p  pI am not familiar with Oracles entitymodels, and Im running into a bit of a rabbithole in terms of figuring out what strongTable Spacestrong actually means, as Im finding it defined in terms of other Oraclespecific lingo which I also dont understand. p  pCould someone give me a rundown of how a limited Oracle table space of some size emxem is a limitation or notp  pstrongemEditemstrong An example of where this appears is a hrefhttpswww.revion.comhostingoracleoracleonly relnofollowherea.p

Negative 363 pBasically I have a method which I need to run when the constructor is finished the method is called persist and it simply saves a key which was generated during the constructor into the session. It seems simple enough, and it works  at the end of construct I make the call to thispersist.p  pThe problem is that this class is subclassed many times. This causes two issues.p  pOne, that I must remember to make the call to persist at the end of every single subclasss construct method. Not a huge issue but it doesnt feel very OOP, I feel like I could be dealing with this in the parent class some how and that this would be better.p  pTwo, if a subclass is subclassed which it is, and the construct methods chained i.e. parentconstruct called, the persist method will be getting fired multiple times, once for each time the class has been subclassed. It only needs to be called once, when all construction is complete. In this scenario it doesnt really break anything because when the persist method is called for the 2nd, 3rd time etc., it simply overwrites what was persisted before.

Negative 363 pWhen a user logs in to my app from an iPhoneiPad, Safari helpfully zooms in while the user is filling out the usernamepassword fields. But when the form is submitted and we log them in, we dont reload the page this is a single page application, so the zoom is never reset. So the app is always started at a zoomed in scale. p  pI have looked at a hrefhttpadactio.comjournal4470 relnofollowJeremy Keiths solutiona, which successfully resets the zoom, but also prevents future scalingzooming by the user, because he sets the codemaximumscalecode of the viewport. p  pLike this p  precodevar viewportmeta  document.querySelectormeta[nameviewport]  if viewportmeta      viewportmeta.content  widthdevicewidth, minimumscale1.0, maximumscale1.0, initialscale1.0  codepre  pHas anyone seen a nice solution for reseting this after a form submission, without freezing up the viewport afterwardsp

Negative 363 pI have searched numerous places and have failed to find the solution to my problem.p  pI have a WebView in my android app and body of the HTML contains an iframe. The iframe is actually a media file from mixlr Im not sure if this matters. When I press anywhere on the WebView it prompts me, Open with streaming media player. I want the audio to start playing directly from the webview without having to switch apps.p  pThis solutionp  pa hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions6247146webviewnotopeningandroiddefaultvideoplayerWebView NOT opening android default video playerap  pprevented the popup from occurring but instead threw an ERRUNKNOWNURLSCHEME.p  pThe weird thing is, it was working before. It would automatically start streaming the audio without prompts I forget if this was prior to switching to Lollipop. Im suspecting this is because of an android update because it went from no prompt to prompting without having installed a new build. If this is the reason, is there any way to prevent this from happening and stream the audio straight from WebView.p  pIve also looked into MediaPlayer. This solution doesnt work for me because mixlr doesnt give you an mp3 embed file but rather an iframe.p

Negative 363 pIm using D3 to render a few hundreds of svg elements.

Negative 363 pI am trying to wrap my head around the concept of Dependency Injection. I have a visual studio solution. I have split it into 3 projects DataAccessLayer, ServiceLayer, BusinessLogicLayer. p  pThe ServiceLayer acts as a link between BusinessLogic and DataAccess hiding things like SQL and LINQ statements from the BusinessLogic. p  pNow, many tutorials online recommends using DependencyInjection to use the classes in the ServiceLayer in my BusinessLayer. I believe, the reason is so that the BusinessLayer is loosely coupled with the ServiceLayer. I, however, do not fully understand how to implement this when these two layers and their corresponding classes are in different projects.p  pAccording to online tutorials, I will have my classes in ServiceLayer implement an Interface which is what will be referred to in my BusinessLayer. But which project should this interface be defined It makes sense that this interface is defined in the ServiceLayer. But wouldnt having a reference to this interface from the BusinessLayer cause a tightly coupled logic between these projects Would that take away the benefit of Dependency Injectionp  pI hope someone can give me a Dependency Injection for Dummies kind of answer for me explaining where my understanding is wrong. Thank you in advance p
Negative 363 pI know that there are similar questions around on Stackoverflow but I dont feel they answer the following.p  pGraph Databases to my understanding store data following mostly this schemap  precodeTableCollection 1 store nodes with UID TableCollection 2 store relations referencing nodes via UID codepre  pThis allows storing arbitrary types of graphs. Now as I understand triple stores store nothing but triplesp  precodeTripleCollection 1 store triples 2 nodes, 1 relation codepre  pNow I would see the following distinction regarding use casesp  ul liGraph Databases when you have known, static connections li liTriple Stores when you have loosely connected nodes and are often looking for new connectionsli ul  pI am confused by the fact that people do not seem to be discussing which one to use according to these criteria. Most article I find are talking about arguments like speed or compatibility. But is this not the most relevant pointp  pPut the other way roundp  ul liImagine having a clearly connected, user defined graph. Why on earth would you want to store that as triples only, loosing all the info about connections Or having to implement some custom solution storing IDs in the triple codesubjectcode.li liImagine having loosely collected nodes that you want to query for unknown relations using SPARQL. Graph databases do support that. But for this they have to build another index I assume and would be slowerli ul

Negative 363 pIm trying to using Yesod as mobile applications API backend and have chosen to use bearer JWTs to handle authentication and authorization. Ive overridden codemaybeAuthIdcode so that Yesod.Auth accepts or rejects the JWTs just fine. However, I cant figure out how to get the auth plugins to return a token to the client instead of its default behavior of storing the AuthId in the client session and redirecting the client. Is there anyway to alter the default auth plugin flow to have it return a token to the client insteadp  pemUpdateem Ive dug around in the docs and source code for a bit and have a better idea of how the auth plugins work now Auth plugins internally call codesetCredsRedirectcode to set the session and do the callback codeonLogincode. The problem with using codeonLogincode is that codeCredscode are not accessible from inside that function. My only other idea for a solution is to edit the codeauthenticatecode function to respond with the JWT.p

Negative 363 pAnyone know the replacement call in Crashlytics for logException which seems to be deprecated as of 2.2.4 My issue is that I have exceptions that I catch, but I suspect they lead to further errors which then cause the application to crash. I want to log all handled exceptions also, and see them in one place. Was using Flurry but just didnt seem to do the trick, where as Crashlytics looks to be more robust. I want them all in the same tool since it is a thousand times easier matching up the exceptions in just one place, rather than patching it together thru LogEntries, Flurry and Crashlytics. Once I get the major crash elements identified I will slowly remove the logException calls and just look for real hard crashes.p  pthanksp

Negative 363 pI am trying to write a remote shell program  emulator that displays as a vt100 terminal. Ive finished writing the terminal emulator on the receiving end of the connection and tested it with ssh  everything works fine. But now Im having some difficulty writing the remote shell daemon that accepts the connection on the host computer. p  pI have initialized a pseudoterminal pty and hooked the slave side up to a bash shell successfully. However whenever the terminal goes into application mode applications like vim that dont have a prompt, it is still necessary to send a newline character before a response is received. For example, if I am in vim and type dd to delete a line, nothing happens until I press enter. Then the effects of dd and the subsequent return happen deleted line  cursor moves to next line. After debugging on the server side, I found that the master side of the pseudoterminal is getting all of the keys at the right time, but the slave side will not respond until it receives a newline. p  pMy question is How do I get immediate responses from the slave side bash program, and not have it wait to respond until a newline is received p  pSorry if I am uncleardoing something wrong. This is my first question here. p

So I search for a hopefully standard implementation which fit the needs for compile time constant representation with implemented features like beginend and iterators to fulfill the minimum container requirements to get them used with range based for and others.p  pc14 is also available, if there is something I search for.p  pAll what I found is full template implemented where the access to the data is also compile time constant likep  precodecontainer.getlt2gt  codepre  pwhich I also could not use, because I need runtime vars to access my data.p  pEDIT Which problemoverhead comes up while using stdvectorp  pWhile using stdvector I need also newdelete which results in having mallocfree for avr. I also found that on avr the initialization of the vector itself takes arround 350 bytes code for each template instance I use. The access functions like codeoperator[]code and also the iterators are very small.p

Negative 363 pThis is a bit of a followup to the question a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions31681946disablewarningsoriginatingfromscipyDisable warnings originating from scipya. The answer succeeds in redirecting any output intended for codestdoutcode to codedevnullcode. The new goal is to capture codestdoutcode as its being printed so that I can examine it for the presence of certain strings. Heres a partial solution that raises a codeMyErrorcode whenever a string containing warning is printed to codestdoutcode using something like codeprintcode or codesys.stdout.writecodep  precodeimport sys import contextlib  class WarningCatcher     def writeself, string         if warning in string             raise MyError  contextlib.contextmanager def capturewarning     oldout, sys.stdout  sys.stdout, WarningCatcher     try         yield sys.stdout     except MyError          handle error     finally         sys.stdout  oldout  with capturewarning as out     print warning codepre  pHowever, it does not redirect things at the file descriptor level as explained in this other post on redirection a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions4675728redirectstdouttoafileinpython2243426222434262herea.p  pMy question is then can I capture ballb output to codestdoutcode in a manner similar to the above code, raising an error if a certain string is found The key is that I dont want to be writing to an actual file which is why the original plan was to write everything to codedevnullcode. It seemed like using the tempfile module with a moderate buffer size might work as this would allow me to use codedup2code to completely redirect things, but this approach hasnt been met with success.p

Negative 363 pI am developing a multithreaded application, where several processors Runnables in ThreadPools send messages to each other.

However, I want my application to become modular a hrefhttpmartinfowler.comarticlesmicroservices.html relnofollowMicroservice Architecturea, so I decided to use RabbitMQ as a message broker.p  pThe problem is to migrate from java implementations of the queues to RabbitMQ with minimal changes in clients source code.

Actually I wanted to do a listview where it display the top 3 latest records. p  pa hrefhttpi.stack.imgur.comin4f0.png relnofollowimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comin4f0.png altenter image description hereap  pAnd when the user click the load more button, the other messages will appear. But when a new message appear, the top 3 messages will not be replaced by the new records, instead display the top 3 messages  new records until the user click refresh and the record will query the latest top 3 records. p  pThank you.p

Negative 363 pI recently ran across this Netflix Blog article a hrefhttptechblog.netflix.com201308deployingnetflixapi.html relnofollowhttptechblog.netflix.com201308deployingnetflixapi.htmlap  pThey are talking about redblack deployment where they run the old and new code side by side and direct the production traffic to both of them. If something goes wrong they do a rollback.p  pHow does the directing of the traffic work and is it possible to adapt this strategy with e.g two Docker containersp

Negative 363 pI have this Caesar cipher program thats supposed to take a char array of encrypted messages and brute force decrypt it by deciphering the messages using each key and then in a separate function it will compare the first word in each deciphered message to another char array in the header file.

I cant think of any other way to do these functions.p  pHeres the full code and I only need to redo the Decipher and the SolveCipher functions but also keeping them only two functions with those specific parameters.
