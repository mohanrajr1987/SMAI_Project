Positive 6716 pIm currently working on a dumb down version of iTunes in which tracks can be imported, modified, exported, etc. This is my first largescale programming project using any language. Ive structured the process of changing imported tracks in such a way that each time a track is modified its deleted from the Treeview Widget and the updated version is reinserted. So tracks are constantly getting new IDs which I make sure to keep updated throughout my entire program. My question, is this an okay way of updating information. Do you think this will lead to any performance issues And are there better more elegant ways of accomplishing the same goal How would I go about just editing the rows Right now I can edit them but the updated content doesnt reflect in the Treeview. self.tree.update doesnt seem to do anything either.

Positive 6716 pI am making a widget where i want to set texts and images at a specific position. I want an output like UCCW widgets. I have tried frame layout, relative layout, and canvas but nothing works like it. Whenever i resize the widget from 2x2 to some odd size like 4x2 then the positions of texts mess up. I want to know how to set them at specific positions and how do they automatically resize when the widget size is changed without any issue.p  pImage for referencep  pa hrefhttpi.stack.imgur.com7L1Q0.jpg relnofollowimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.com7L1Q0.jpg altImage for referenceap  pThanksp
Positive 6716 pSorry if this has been asked before, I could found anything similar and Im getting loony here. I have written several php widgets for wordpress and everything works fine so far except for one thing. I have a dropdown menu and textfields in some of my widgets. Now when I drag and drop my widgets to the sidebar, the textfields are filled with the desired default values and the dropdown menu is selected on the value i have supplied in defaults array.p  pThing is if I change the dropdown menus selected index, textfields should get updated accordingly via javascript based on the selected index Its basically a contact widget where you can select a contact from the dropdown menu and then edit values like name, address, etc. for that contact before displaying it in frontend, but nothing happens. If I output the current selected index of the dropdown menu, it remains on the default value no matter what index is selected. However, after saving the widget, everything works fine. Now, everything I could find was that apparently, wordpress saves widgets immediately after droping them to the sidebar, but does not update the page. This is only done after hitting the save button. But why doesnt .selectedIndex changep  pAnybody knows where im mistaking atp  pSorry if my code is a bit messy, im actually not a php programmer. The contacts are stored in pfcontact.php, so Contactcontacts gets me an array of Contact objects with keys 1,2,3...countcontacts, and ContactgetContactiasArray returns the Contact object on index i as array that looks like array Name  Some Name, Street  Example Street 13, City  MyCity, etc... p  precode include pf classes, like contact class.  requireonceWPCONTENTDIR . widgetspfclasses.php     if   classexists pfContact        addactionwidgetsinit, pfcontactwidget       register widget     function pfcontactwidget              registerwidgetpfContact           class pfContact extends WPWidget                      constructor                   function pfContact                      widgetops  arrayclassname gt pfcontactwidget, description gt show contact data.              controlops  arrayidbase gt pfcontactwidget              thisgtWPWidgetpfcontactwidget, contact data, widgetops, controlops                              function widget           description           to display the widget content on the frontend.                   function widgetargs, instance                      extractargs               no text beforeafter the main content.             beforewidget  afterwidget                 grab the id of the currently selected contact.             id  instance[contactid]              echo beforewidget             gt              lt main content frontend gt             ltdiv classpfwidgetfront pfwidgetcontactgt                 lt display all contact data for the contact that was selected in backend. gt                 ltphp foreachContactgetContactidgtasArray as key gt val                      display one line per contact info entry. leave out email because its a link, well do that separately further down.                     ifissetinstance[contactdatafield.id..key] ampamp emptyinstance[contactdatafield.id..key] ampamp key  EMail                           display value of keyfield.

Positive 6716 pI have a strange problem with a widget I developed. The widget works normally on the home screen, updating as it should. I have recently made some changes to the code, adding some more intents to the widget receiver. p  pThe original intent filter for the widget was the followingp  precodeltintentfiltergt     ltaction androidnameandroid.appwidget.action.APPWIDGETUPDATE gt ltintentfiltergt codepre  pAfter the changes, I added the following intentsp  precodeltintentfiltergt     ltaction androidnamecom.basi.widget.MYUPDATEWIDGET gt     ltaction androidnameandroid.intent.action.TIMECHANGED gt     ltaction androidnameandroid.intent.action.TIMEZONECHANGED gt     ltaction androidnameandroid.intent.action.LOCALECHANGED gt ltintentfiltergt codepre  pand changed the widget from being updated by a service to being updated by an recurring alarm that sends the MYUPDATEWIDGET intent. The problem is that when I update the application, the widget stops updating and a Problem loading widget appears. When I remove the widget from the home screen and add it back, it works as it should, even if I install further updates. It looks like something goes wrong with the particular update, i.e., the changing of the intents. I have checked the logcat and there are no errors but I have noticed that the onReceive intent is not firing up after the initial update so that is probably the problem.p  pWhat I suspect is that a widget already on a home screen knows which intents to receive  if it is not reinitialized by removing it and adding it back, it will not listen to the new intents so that is why the problem happens. Is there a way to tell the widget to start receiving the new intents Is it a different problemp

I need to now set this ItemList array back into the main Root dictionary and then that Root dictionary sent back to the AppDelegate, so that on applicationWillTerminate [self.data writeToFile] can be called and the downloaded information does not need to be downloaded the next time.p

Negative 6716 pHow to create a singleton class which inherit from MarkUpExtension classp
Negative 6716 pThe Android app Im currently developing has a main activity that has grown quite large. This is mainly because it contains a codeTabWidgetcode with 3 tabs. Each tab has quite a few components. The activity has to control of all those components at once. So I think you can imagine that this Activity has like 20 fields a field for almost every component. Also it contains a lot of logic click listeners, logic to fill lists, etc.p  pWhat I normally do in component based frameworks is to split everything up into custom components. Each custom component would then have a clear responsibility. It would contain its own set of components and all other logic related to that component.p  pI tried to figure out how this can be done, and I found something in the Android documentation what they like to call a Compound Control. See a hrefhttpdeveloper.android.comguidetopicsuicustomcomponents.htmlcompoundhttpdeveloper.android.comguidetopicsuicustomcomponents.htmlcompounda and scroll to the Compound Controls section I would like to create such a component based on an XML file defining the view structure.p  pIn the documentation it saysp  blockquote   pNote that just like with an Activity,   you can use either the declarative   XMLbased approach to creating the   contained components, or you can nest   them programmatically from your code.p blockquote  pWell, thats good news The XMLbased approach is exactly what I want But it doesnt say how to do it, except that it is like with an Activity... But what I do in an Activity is call codesetContentView...code to inflate the views from XML. That method is not available if you for example subclass codeLinearLayoutcode.p  pSo I tried to inflate the XML manually like thisp  precodepublic class MyCompoundComponent extends LinearLayout       public MyCompoundComponentContext context, AttributeSet attributeSet          supercontext, attributeSet         LayoutInflater inflater  LayoutInflater context.getSystemServiceContext.LAYOUTINFLATERSERVICE         inflater.inflateR.layout.mylayout, this       codepre  pThis works, except for the fact that the XML Im loading has codeLinearLayoutcode declared as the root element. This results in the inflated codeLinearLayoutcode being a child of codeMyCompoundComponentcode which itself already is a codeLinearLayoutcode So now we have a redundant LinearLayout in between codeMyCompoundComponentcode and the views it actually needs.p  pCan somebody please provide me with a better way to approach this, avoiding having a redundant codeLinearLayoutcode instantiatedp

So totally in resultset I have 162 records, which contain duplicates for codeBcode.p  pFor examplep  precodeB  BO   BOV 1  1     1 1  1     2 1  2     1 2  1     1  codepre  pand so on.p  pActually there are 10 distinct codeBcodes. So II want only 10 codeBcodes from the resultset not 162 records. Also II should be able to get corresponding codeBOcode and codeBOVcodes like for codeB1code all values of codeBOcode and codeBOVcodes.p  pHow can I do this This is pure java logic and cannot change anything for the stored procedure. Just have to process the resultset.p
Negative 6716 pIm beginning to work on a COBOLBASIC IDE at work to replace the one that we have currently thats a slight step up from Notepad.  Itll be made in C.  The management is really interested in implementing some Visual Studio type features, and a big one is code folding.  Ive looked on MSDN, but I didnt see any good way to collapse lines or to add the expandcollapse buttons.  p  pIm assuming that the text area should be a RichTextBox.  Am I off track here  I suppose it could be done with some sort of modified TreeView, but that seems a little wrong to me.  Is there some way of doing this that Im just missingp
Negative 6716 pAn interesting problem occured recently, and Ive been thinking of the best way for a given value of best to implement this.p  pIn essence, its one of tracking notes against source code. The example that flagged this was getting a problem fixed in live within SLAs, and how to best achieve this. Without going into all the details, it came down to finding a function thats used in a number of places which may or may not be buggy, yet the problem was being reporting only in a single location.p  pThe fix to meet the SLAs was simply to add a check into the location where the problem was reported, rather than tweaking the common code and having to test everything that touches that function.p  pThe interesting issue is then for upstreaming. The correct method would then be to go back and check the original function, validate its correct for everywhere its called and then make the change properly if its determined the library function is wrong.p  pThe problem is this takes time, so upstreaming may simply take the workaround, etc. However if the problem occurs again say six months later in another location calling the same library function, there isnt an easy way to link the two problems together. You can search the bug tracking database, but this isnt guranteed to help  it depends if a notes been added saying something along the lines of this library function needs more thorough checking, but no time to investigate now.p  pSo the question is this within a large team of developers 30 plus, split into teams of both support and ongoing development, what methods do you use to manage what are effectively sticky notes against source code, short of adding a comment to the suspicious functions source code saying this might be a bit dodgyp  pThe problem with the commiting a comment is one of process a change is a change, so committing a zerochange change i.e., one where just comments are added is not ideal developers can make mistakes even adding a comment hit a stray key or something so its always IMO better to commit emonlyem where actual changes are made.p  pNow a wiki could be used to track perfile notes, but weve got a minimum of four branches and inexcess of a few hundred files SQL objects, source code, XML files, etc, so a wiki will get unmangable quite quickly.p  pThis is the sort of thing that it would be nice if SCMs could support  bits of metadata against files that are simply notes, but dont add to the SCMs version history  that can be displayed when doing say an codesvn updatecode, or manually viewed.p  pThere may already be solutions out there  so how do you manage this type of knowledge sharingp
Negative 6716 pI am not sure that I understand Isolated storage.  I read the article a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibrary3ak841sy28VS.8029.aspx relnofollowhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibrary3ak841sy28VS.8029.aspxap  p1 Why I dont just use App data folder p  p2 In the link above  With isolated storage, data is always isolated by user and by assembly. Credentials such as the origin or the strong name of the assembly determine assembly identity. Data can also be isolated by application domain, using similar credentials. I cant think about a scenario that makes this future important.p  pIn general I dont understand the philosophy and the need of isolated storage which inspire MS to create such a thing.p  pThanksp
Negative 6716 pI am going through one of my .R files and by cleaning it up a little bit I am trying to get more familiar with writing the code the right way. As a beginner, one of my favorite starting points is to get rid of the codeforcode loops and try to transform the expression into a functional programming form. So here is the scenariop  pI am assembling a bunch of codedata.framescode into a codelistcode for later usage. p  precodedataList lt list dataA,                   dataB,                   dataC,                   dataD,                   dataE                    codepre  pNow I like to take a look at each data.frames column names and substitute certain character strings. Eg I like to substitute each foo and bar with baz. At the moment I am getting the job done with a codeforcode loop which looks a bit awkward.p  precodecolnamesdataList[[1]] [1] foo        code lp15       bar       lh15   colnamesdataList[[2]] [1] a        code lp50       ls50       foo    matchVec lt cfoo, bar for i in seqdataList    for j in seqmatchVec      colnames dataList[[i]][greppatternmatchVec[j], xcolnames dataList[[i]]] lt cbaz     codepre  pSince I am working here with a codelistcode I thought about the codelapplycode function. My attempts handling the job with the codelapplycode function all seem to look alright but only at first sight. If I writep  precodef lt functioni, xList    gsubpatterncfoo, replacementcbaz, xcolnamesxList[[i]]  lapplyseqdataList, f, xListdataList codepre  pthe last line prints out almost what I am looking for. However, if i take another look at the actual names of the data.frames in dataListp  precodelapply dataList, colnames codepre  pI see that no changes have been made to the initial character strings.p  pSo how can I rewrite the codeforcode loop and transform it into a functional programming form And how do I substitute both strings, foo and bar, in an efficient way Since the codegsubcode function takes as its codepatterncode argument only a character vector of length one.p

Negative 6716 pI have used the Silverlight BusinessApplication template in VS2010.  I have changed the AuthenticationService to use my own Authentication methods  the requirement is that the user logs into the system with their SQL login no AD in the company.  p  pOn login, I construct a SQLConnection, attempt to open it, then I get their details friendly name, roles etc from a User table.  I then store the username and password that they entered and any time they hit the DB through a DomainService I override CreateObjectContext and insert the username and password they entered into the DB.p  pI have changed the AuthenticationService to inherit from IAuthentication and LinqToEntitiesDomainService, mainly for accessing the User table.p  pIm running into an issue when starting the application, before the user has logged in.  The LoginStatus control that comes with the BusinessApplication template has the following linep  precodeprivate readonly AuthenticationService authService  WebContext.Current.Authentication codepre  pThis causes the constructor of my AuthenticationService to be called and, as part of that, the ObjectContext is attempted to be created but the user has not yet logged in so I have no username  password to add into the connection string.

Negative 6716 pI have been recently involved in handling the console logs for a server and I was wondering, out of curiosity, that is there a performance issue in writing to a large file as compared to small ones.p  pFor instance is it a good idea to keep the log file size small instead of letting them grow bulky, but I was not able to argue much in favor of either approach. p  pThere might be problems in reading or searching in the file, but right now I am more interested in knowing if writing can be affected in any way. Looking for an expert advice.p  pEdit The way I thought it was that the OS only has to open a file handle and push the data to the file system. There is little correlation to the file size, since you have to keep on appending the data to the end of the file and whenever a block of data is full, OS will assign another block to the file. As I said earlier, there can be problems in reading and searching because of defragmentation of file blocks, but I could not find much difference while writing.p

Negative 6716 pLooking at the profiler I see a few differences.  The second query which uses the strongincludestrong will in fact return data from related to the secondary table CountryCodes.  This part makes sense to me.  I dont however understand why this query has two joins.  First it does a regular inner join between CountryCodes ands CountyCodeTypes on the foreign key which I would think be sufficient to return everything that the strongincludestrong requires.  However it then does another outer join.  Whyp  precodevar query  from codes in base.context.CountryCodes             join codeTypes in base.context.CountryCodeTypes             on codes.CountryCodeTypeId equals codeTypes.CountryCodeTypeId             where codeTypes.CountryCodeTypeName  countryCodeType             select codes  var query  from codes in base.context.CountryCodes.IncludeCountryCodeType             where codes.CountryCodeType.CountryCodeTypeName  countryCodeType             select codes codepre  presulting sqlp  precode FROM   [dbo].[CountryCode] AS [Extent1]  INNER JOIN [dbo].[CountryCodeType] AS [Extent2] ON [Extent1].[CountryCodeTypeId]  [Extent2].[CountryCodeTypeId]  LEFT OUTER JOIN [dbo].[CountryCodeType] AS [Extent3] ON [Extent1].[CountryCodeTypeId]  [Extent3].[CountryCodeTypeId]  WHERE [Extent2].[CountryCodeTypeName]  plinq0 codepre  pAlso, is it fair to say that I should use the .Include only when I actually need data in the foreign key table to be populated in my result, otherwise use the join  In other words I shouldnt use the .Include as the means to the join because the navigational properties know how to join entities for me based on the keys.p

Negative 6716 pScenario I am using Managed Extensibility Framework to load plugins exports at runtime based on an interface contract defined in a separate dll. In my Visual Studio solution, I have 3 different projects The host application, a class library defining the interface  IPlugin and another class library implementing the interface the export  MyPlugin.dll.p  pThe host looks for exports in its own root directory, so during testing, I build the whole solution and copy Plugin.dll from the Plugin class library binrelease folder to the hosts debug directory so that the hosts DirectoryCatalog will find it and be able to add it to the CompositionContainer. Plugin.dll is not automatically copied after each rebuild, so I do that manually each time Ive made changes to the contractimplementation.p  pHowever, a couple of times Ive run the host application without having copied an updated Plugin.dll first, and it has thrown an exception during compositionp  pcodeUnable to load one or more of the requested types. Retrieve the LoaderExceptions for more informationcodep  pThis is of course due to the fact that the Plugin.dll its trying to import from implements a idifferent versioni of IPlugin, where the propertymethod signatures dont match. Although its easy to avoid this in a controlled and monitored environment, by simply avoiding duh obsolete IPlugin implementations in the plugin folder, I cannot rely on such assumptions in the production environment, where legacy plugins could be encountered.p  pThe problem is that this exception effectively botches the whole Compose action and inoi exports are imported. I would have preferred that the mismatching IPlugin implementations are simply ignored, so that other exports in the catalogs, implementing the correct version of IPlugin, are still imported.p  pIs there a way to accomplish this Im thinking either of several potential optionsp  ul liThere is a flag to set on the CompositionContainer ignore failing imports prior to or when calling Composeli liThere is a similar flag to specify on the codeltImportManygtcode attributeli liThere is a way to hook on to the iteration process underlying Compose, and be able to deal with each failed import individuallyli liUsing strong name signing to somehow only look for imports implementing the icurrenti version of IPluginli ul  pIdeasp

Negative 6716 pMy question is specific to iPhone, iPod, and iPad, since I am assuming that the architecture makes a big difference. Im hoping there is either a specification somewhere for the various chips perhaps, or a reliable way to measure T for each specific instruction. I know I can use any number of tools to measure aggregate processor time used, memory used, etc. I want to quantify at a lower level.p  pSo, Im able to figure out how many times I go through the main part of the algorithm. For example, I iterate coden  n1code times in a naive implementation, and between codencode best case and coden  n  n1code worst case in another. I can also make a reasonable count of the total number of instructions      , and logic statements, and I can compare those counts, but thats assuming the weight of each operation is the same. Also, I dont have any idea how to weight the actual time value of a logic statement if, else, for, while vs a mathematical operator... is if as much work as  each time I use it I would love to know where to find this information.p  pSo, for clarity, my goal is to discover how much processor time I am demanding of the CPU or GPU or any U so that I can design an optimal algorithm around processor time.

Negative 6716 pGiven a set of mp4 files I want to identify only the Audio files not the Video files. Previously I did this by ensuring there was only one trak atom, and that track atom contained a codetrak.mdia.minf.smhdcode atom but since found this was excluding some valid audio files.p  pSo now I check each trak atom found in the file and only reject if we find a codetrak.mdia.minf.vmhdcode atom in any of the atoms OR we dont find at least one codetrak.mdia.minf.smhdcode atom. But Im sure this isnt watertight as there must be video formats that dont use a codevmhdcode atom.p  pWhat would be the best way to go about thisp

Negative 6716 pWe have developed a web app using ASP.NET, .NET 3.5 and SQL Server 2008. It runs on IIS on a Windows Server 2008 R2 server. It has a feature by which, under some circumstances, the app sends email to the users registered email address using classes in System.Net.Mail. It usually works fine a few seconds after the email is sent by our application, the user has the email message in hisher inbox.p  pHowever, in some cases, the user never gets the email message. This happens in an apparent random fashion, and we havent been able to detect any patterns. We have checked spam filters and folders, and made sure that the email addresses are OK. In one instance, we had two users from the same company, with addresses abccompany.co.uk and xyzcompany.co.uk one of them gets his emails perfectly, whereas the other never gets them.p  pAny idea of where to start debugging this Thank you.p

Negative 6716 pIm going to be running a large number of simulations producing a large amount of data that needs to be stored and accessed again later. Output data from my simulation program is written to text files one per simulation. I plan on writing a Python program that reads these text files and then stores the data in a format more convenient for analyzing later. After quite a bit of searching, I think Im suffering from information overload, so Im putting this question to stackoverflow for some advice. Here are the detailsp  pMy data will basically take the form of a multidimensional array where each entry will look something like thisp  pdata[ stringArg1, stringArg2, stringArg3, stringArg4, intArg1 ]  [ floatResult01, floatResult02, ..., floatResult12 ]p  pEach argument has roughly the following numbers of potential valuesp  pstringArg1 50p  pstringArg2 20p  pstringArg3 6p  pstringArg4 24p  pintArg1 10,000p  pNote, however, that the data set will be sparse. For example, for a given value of stringArg1, only about 16 values of stringArg2 will be filled in. Also, for a given combination of stringArg1, stringArg2 roughly 5000 values of intArg1 will be filled in. The 3rd and 4th string arguments are always completely filled.p  pSo, with these numbers my array will have roughly 50166245000  576,000,000 result lists.p  pIm looking for the best way to store this array such that I can save it and reopen it later to either add more data, update existing data, or query existing data for analysis. Thus far Ive looked into three different approachesp  p1. a relational databasep  p2. PyTablesp  p3. Python dictionary that uses tuples as the dictionary keys using pickle to save amp reloadp  pTheres one issue I run into in all three approaches, I always end up storing every tuple combination of stringArg1, stringArg2, stringArg3, stringArg4, intArg1, either as a field in a table, or as the keys in the Python dictionary. From my possibly naive point of view, it seems like this shouldnt be necessary. If these were all integer arguments then they would just form the address of each data entry in the array, and there wouldnt be any need to store all the potential address combinations in a separate field. For example, if I had a 2x2 array  [[100, 200] , [300, 400]] you would retrieve values by asking for the value at an address array[0][1]. You wouldnt need to store all the possible address tuples 0,0 0,1 1,0 1,1 somewhere else. So Im hoping to find a way around this.p  pWhat I would love to be able to do is define a table in PyTables, where cells in this first table contain other tables. For example, the toplevel tables would have two columns. Entries in the first column would be the possible values of stringArg1. Each entry in the second column would be a table. These subtables would then have two columns, the first being all the possible values of stringArg2, the second being another column of subsubtables...p  pThat kind of solution would be straightforward to browse and query particularly if I could use ViTables to browse the data. The problem is PyTables doesnt seem to support having the cells of one table contain other tables. So I seem to have hit a dead end there.p  pIve been reading up on data warehousing and the star schema approach, but it still seems like your fact table would need to contain tuples of every possible argument combination.p  pOkay, so thats pretty much where I am. Any and all advice would be very much appreciated. At this point Ive been searching around so much that my brain hurts. I figure its time to ask the experts. Thanks in advance to anyone and everyone who replies.p

Negative 6716 pThe current project in Systems Programming is to come up with an ASCII compressor that removes the top zero bit and writes the contents to the file.p  pIn order to facilitate decompression, the original file size is written to file, then the compressed char bytes.

My code below works as expected for the first test file, as it writes 56 bytes of compressed text plus 4 bytes of file header.p  pHowever, when I try it on the long test file, the compressed version is 3 bytes shorter than the original, when it should be roughly 749KiB smaller, or 14 of original size.

Checking the concurrency docsp  blockquote   pFor blocks that you plan to perform   asynchronously using a dispatch queue,   it is safe to capture scalar variables   from the parent function or method and   use them in the block. However, you   should not try to capture large   structures or other pointerbased   variables that are allocated and   deleted by the calling context. By the   time your block is executed, the   memory referenced by that pointer may   be gone. Of course, it is safe to   allocate memory or an object   yourself and explicitly hand off   ownership of that memory to the block.p blockquote  pSo how do I dispatch asynchronously a method on codethiscode objectp  pThanksp

Basically, what you need is to define a remote ref that need not exist before hand. p  ol liCreate a projectli liTeamShare it to a local repositoryli liIn the repository view WindowShow View Git  Repositories select the local repository and right click on remotesli liSelect new remote configure push. Type origin in the remote name. Press OKli liChange URL. Copypaste the ssh uri from github. Select ssh protocol make sure you have ssh key defined in eclipse SSH preferences, and uploaded to githubli liNow the last part is to add Ref mapping. Click on Add.. in ref mapping section of screen. And enter refsheadsmaster in both local and remote branches.li ol  hr  pOr may be the refsheadsmaster on both side isnt a good idea  I see, cloning a github repo that doesnt have ghpages branch is simpler as it automatically creates this remote fetch specp  pRemote Fetch Specification  coderefsheadsrefsremotesorigincodep  pMaybe this is what I need to enter in the step 6 abovep  hr  pOk as it turned out the original idea of refsheadsmaster in both local and remote branch was correct. Pushing with this configuration is showing my changes in git hub correctly. The second option on the other hand is failing silently.p

This call retains the value object passed in.             CFDictionarySetValuepropertyMatchDict, CFSTRkIOPrimaryInterface, kCFBooleanTrue                Now add the dictionary containing the matching value for kIOPrimaryInterface to our main              matching dictionary. This call will retain propertyMatchDict, so we can release our reference               on propertyMatchDict after adding it to matchingDict.

Negative 6716 pIm trying to determine the best way to store large numbers of small .mat files, around 9000 objects with sizes ranging from 2k to 100k, for a total of around half a gig.p  pThe typical use case is that I only need to pull a small number say 10 of the files from disk at a time. p  pWhat Ive triedp  pMethod 1 If I save each file individually, I get performance problems very slow save times and system sluggishness for some time after as Windows 7 has difficulty handling so may files in a folder And I think my SSD is having a rough time of it, too. However, the end result is fine, I can load what I need very quickly. This is using v6 save.p  pMethod 2 If I save all of the files in one .mat file and then load just the variables I need, access is very slow loading takes around three quarters of the time it takes to load the whole file, with small variation depending on the ordering of the save. This is using v6 save, too.p  pI know I could split the files up into many folders but it seems like such a nasty hack and wont fix the SSDs dislike of writing many small files, is there a better way p  pEdit The objects are consist mainly of a numeric matrix of double data and an accompanying vector of uint32 identifiers, plus a bunch of small identifying properties char and numeric.p

Negative 6716 pI read a hrefhttpwww.effectiveperlprogramming.comblog1324 relnofollowthis blogentrya regarding perl and how they handle unicode and normalization of unicode.  Short version, as I understand it, is that there are several ways to write the identifier  in unicode. Either as one unicode character or as a combination of two character. And the perl program may not be able to distinguish between them causing strange errors.p  pSo that got me thinking, how does the Java editor in Eclipse handle unicode Or java in general, since I guess thats the same question.p  pOn one hand the a hrefhttpjava.sun.comdocsbooksjlssecondeditionhtmllexical.doc.html relnofollowspecificationa saysp  blockquote   pTwo identifiers are the same only if they are identical, that is, have the same Unicode character for each letter or digit.p blockquote  pBut on the other, the unicode chars are translated p  blockquote   pThis translation step allows any program to be expressed using only ASCII characters. p blockquote  pThis seems to contradict each otherp
Negative 6716 pIve done some messing around with Android apps, but so far only made apps with the built in views, like buttons textfields, etc.  Im now trying to convert a game I made in java for the computer to an Android app, as that was my original intention, I just didnt have a droid at the time and found the emulator too frustratingly slow to do any real testing.p  pSo far everythings gone well converting it and figuring out the app life cycle, but Im at a loss when it comes to graphics.  Ive read through pages of the android dev library, few tutorials, and questions here on stackoverflow.  I thought I was understanding it but lately it seems like the more I read the more confused I get.p  pI have images Ive put into the drawable folders, but now I need to know how to draw multiple instances of them to the screen.  I dont need them to be clickable, just be able to be resized, rotated, and moved around the screen.  From what I understand this should be done with tween animations, but Im having trouble finding any information on using tween.p  pMy original plan was to create a class that extended ImageView, but I didnt know where to go from there.  So I guess my question is how do I load an image from my drawables folder, resize it to fit the screen dimensions, and then rotate it around so I can create an array of rotated versions of the image to use.p  pThen from there how do I create multiple Views or whatever else I should use to be able to display multiple instances of the image, in various rotations.p  pAnother problem I ran into was that the android class overview for View shows that it has methods setX, setY, setTranslationX, etc. to move the view around the layout its on, but eclipse doesnt show those methods for my ImageViews or Views.p  pSorry if this is too much for one question, Ill trim it down to a more specific question if I need to.p  pThanks in advance for your time.p

Negative 6716 pIm using Netbeans 7.1 to develop a number of Java projects. Several of the projects reference each other, and all of them reference external thirdparty libraries such as Log4J, JFreeChart, etc. Now I want to run continuous integration and automated testing using TeamCity 6.5.4, but im new to it and having problems with my thirdparty Jars.p  pIn Netbeans I have just added each of the relevant thirdparty Jar files to a seperate Library, and then I include each library in the project so im not referencing the Jar directly.p  pThe projects are checked in to Subversion. In TeamCity I created one Project, with a seperate Build Configuration for each Netbeans Project each with a different VCS root.

Negative 6716 pMy basic issue is this, I have events firing on pages Ive left based on network activity that are causing problems when I thought the old forms were being destroyed.p  pMore detailed information I am writing a windows phone app that communicates with a network player. I have a static instance of my communication class in my App class so all the forms can share the connection, and all my forms subscribe to it and process results within that form. From a main menu you can choose one type of source and it opens a file browsing form that refreshes a listbox as you navigate, cancels the back button and refreshes the new contents to simulate file navigation until you are the root folder. The app doesnt know if youre clicking on a file or folder, it gets a network message when media starts playing and watch for that and then navigate to a play form. I had been using all .Navigates for this until now and it worked great until I added another branch off the main menu for a new source. Although the new source is completely different, the device sends a lot of the same generic commands which just mean something else in the current context. After visiting the my file browser form and going to my new source, a play command from the network, which means something else now, would cause my to jump into my old play form from the previous source as if I was still on the file browser form, which isnt intended.p  pSo Ive tried many things and have it kind of working now but its message and I lose some features. Currently I changed from using all .navigates, also in the back button override, to trying to use the stack and navigate.gobacks. I pass variables when needed using globals in App and unhook my net listeners from the form, goback, and then connect them in the new forms listeners in it navigatedto. I think there is timing issue though as in some cases I needed to send a command to the media box as its changing and it ended up triggering the wrong event handler again. I think the easiest solution, if possible, and they way I though it would work is if each time I navigated from the form it old one, its handlers, etc were all destroyed and I didnt have to use the stack at all, handling all the back buttons myself.p  pI know thats a long description and thanks if you made it this far, hopefully it made some kind of sense. Does anyone have any suggestions on what I can dop  pAs a side note Im a long time selftaught VB programmer who has been stuck in .net 2.0winforms and Ive just now made the move to C, OOPs, and XAML to write my first Windows Phone app so its likely Im doing something stupid or overlooking something obvious...p

Negative 6716 pI am developing an application which would redirect io from parallel port of, say, strongdevice Astrong to the parallel port of strongdevice Bstrong. The two devices are connected on ethernet LAN, WAN, internet, etc..p  pstrongDevice Astrong has a physical parallel port attached to it but strongdevice Bstrong is a machine with no parallel port on it. This is what makes me emulate a parallel port on strongdevice Bstrong such that windows thinks that it has a parallel port and works in the very manner with it as it works with parallel ports on hardware e.g. it auto detects when a device gets attached to the parallel port so that a driver for that device can be installed.p  pIf any piece of hardware gets attached to the parallel port on strongdevice Astrong the io is redirected to the parallel port on strongdevice Bstrong and the Windows on strongdevice Bstrong thinks that some hardware got attached to strongdevice Bsstrong own parallel port i.e. Windows doesnt know where in the world the hardware actually got attached Windows just got fooled into thinking that the hardware is attached directly to strongdevice Bstrong.p  pMy question is about the emulation part. How do I write a parallel port emulator in C for Windows 7 such that I fool Windows into thinking that it has a realhardware parallel portp  pA related question can be how does windows detect the hardware and on going changes in it e.g. when some hardware gets connected to the parallel port of a computer.p  pThe program flow would be as follows.p  ol liRead data from strongdevice Asstrong parallel port.li liWrite that data to strongdevice Asstrong socket which sends it over to strongdevice Bsstrong socket.li liRead data from strongdevice Bsstrong socket.li liWrite that data to strongdevice Bsstrong parallel port which makes windows think that some hardware got connected to it.li ol  pstrongNBstrong I am to emulate a parallel port only i.e. parallel to parallel redirection only.

Negative 6716 pIm working on an Arduino sketch where I created two traffic lights, one for normal traffic and one for pedestrians. I created a function for each of these two lights, which loops it through its cycle for example turn yellow, wait 20 seconds, then turn red and wait again. These are called aTrafficlight and pTrafficlight, where a is the normal light and p the one for the pedestrians. In my loop function I set a digitalRead for a button. When this button is pressed the traffic lights should cycle through their loops one at a time so the normal light turns red, pTrafficlight waits a bit, then turns green, blinks a few times, turns red, waits and ends the loop, so it goes to its original state.p  pThis all works. But now I want to add a buzzer. This buzzer must beep once a second while the pTrafficlight is red, once a tenth second while its green and twice per two seconds while its flashing green.p  pHere I encountered a few problems   When waiting in original state buttons not pressed it seems I can sometimes press the button without reaction because the loop is still going. I need to figure out how to avoid waiting in the loop when buttonState  LOW. Theres a function waitint sec   When the button is pressed, it loops through the cycles. I could just write some kind of loop implementing the traffic light being red and beeping at the same time, but Id rather keep these seperated.   Same for the double beeps. I do not want the beeping and flashing of the light to be in the same for loop, as its confusing and difficult to read and understand the code.p  pHeres my loopp  precodeint buttonState  0  void loop   buttonState  digitalReadpButton    ifbuttonState  LOW     vSetred     pSetgreen       This is where I tried to create the sound.     digitalWritepSound, HIGH     delay10     digitalWritepSound, LOW     wait1    else      aTrafficlight     pTrafficlight     codepre  pIs there a way to solve my problems with multithreading I tried to look it up at arduino.cc and google, but I cant find a way I understand enough to use it in my existing code.p  pIf not, do you have any better suggestionsp

Negative 6716 pSo my question is What would be the best way, to make a serverclient connection via PHP My first approach what Im using right now is to do it with AJAX. with jQueryp  pTo be a bit more specific I have a lobby, and a game mode, and my top priorities are the chat, and the ingame users.p  pWhat Im doing right now I have a PHP file, that updates a record in the database for every user ingame, and another file that cheks this regularly. lets say in every 5 seconds The problem with this, that therere a lot of mysql calls, lots of ajax call, and sometimes when the ajax cant load in time, the record wont update in time, ergo  the user gets disconnected.p  pNote that I need this for my dissertation so I have time to do my homework about this even if you give me some links.p  pstrongAnystrong answers and tips are welcome Thanks in advance.p
Negative 6716 pIn my code I have an Ajax lookup bound to the codefocusoutcode event of a textbox.  The Ajax request will display an error message if the data provided was invalid.  I also have a cancel button on a form that, when clicked, hides some fields including the one with the request.  However, if an invalid value is specified in the textbox, clicking the Cancel button fires off the Ajax request because the textbox loses focus and the error message gets displayed.p  pWhat I want is when I click the cancel button, this Ajax event is strongnotstrong fired, so even if the user entered an invalid entry the form will be closed without the error message displaying.p  pIs this possiblep  pCode is this, basicallyp  precodetxtPostalCode.focusoutfunction       postalCodeLookupthis.val  ajax method wrapper   buttoncancelButton.clickfunction       txtPostalCode.attrdisabled, true.addClassdisabled  applies CSS style to make textbox look like a label     txtPostalCode.valoldPostalCode.val  restore old value  codepre  pas I said since the focusout fires before the click, you cant cancel the form if theres an invalid entry in the textbox since it will fire the ajax request and come up with the error message.  This issue is from a usability point of view, in that someone might enter an invalid zip code, realize their mistake and then try to cancel the form, but the form wont let itself it be cancelled until they enter a valid zip code which is then just overridden when the form actually does cancel.p  pIf theres a better way to handle what I want to do Im all for hearing that as well, this was the first thing that popped into mind when I received the requirement p
Negative 6716 pI have two entities. Order and OrderLine. One Order can have many OrderLines. Each entity was exposed via its own RIA service. Their Read methods return IEnumerable and IEnumerable.

After submitting my last update, it was rejected for storing data in the wrong location. For the apps rejected I changed the storage location to codeNSCachesDirectorycode.

The app would still function, the DB would get recreated, but all changed tables would be reset, thereby upsetting users.p  pWhere should this type of database file be stored Was I right to put it in the Docs dir According to Apple, the Docs dir is for Critical Data which is either user generated data or data needed for proper operation of the app. I feel that it falls under that category, persisting my users settings is proper operation, but who wants to await an appealp

Negative 6716 pAfter further pondering the implications of a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions9419743fieldinitializerincsharpclassnotrunwhendeserializingDataContractSerializer not calling constructors or static field initializersa, it seems like a cleaner design pattern to have properties selfinitialize like thisp  precodeprivate ObservableCollectionltobjectgt myObjects public ObservableCollectionltobjectgt MyObjects      get                if myObjects  null myObjects  new ObservableCollectionltobjectgt         return myObjects           set              myObjects  value       codepre  pas opposed to providing two initialization paths like thisp  precodepublic MyClass      InitializeClass   [OnDeserialized] private void OnDeserializedStreamingContext c      InitializeClass   private void InitializeClass       Note here I can still use a field.        Selfinitialization requires a property.     myObjects  new ObservableCollectionltobjectsgt     codepre  pMy main concern is that the latter pattern will not fail unit tests that construct the class with codenewcode should the special codeOnDeserializedcode initialization be forgotten, unless those unit tests are specifically designed to have knowledge that they may be used with codeDataContractSerializercode at some point.  p  pThat feels too entangled.p  pOne downside of the selfinitialization approach is that it requires properties rather than fields since field initializers are ignored by codeDataContractSerializercode.p  pAre there other downsides that I am not consideringp

Negative 6716 pIm reading Linux Device Driver programming 3rd edition and Ive been trying to get a grasp of openfiles vs inodes. From what the book says , a file structure in the kernel is considered to be an open file. The book also says ,an inode structure is used internally in the kernel to represent files. Therefor it is different from a file structure which is used to represent an open file. That statement in itself is totally confusing to me since a file and an open file is the same thing in my mind. I dont even understand what they mean by an open file in this context. Im totally confused, what is an open file What is an inode And what is the differencep

Negative 6716 pstrongUPDATEPOSSIBLE SOLUTIONstrong Ive realized that the files are being moved from the codeCWindowsTempcode but they are invisible due to file permissions. If I try to access the files via a browser, I get a 401 error. I believe that these files are retaining their original permissions and so I am unable to see them or mess with them via PHPbrowser.

No I am not asking the same, i am done with that, my issue is with the pagesdata pager displayed on my asp.net page.  In my table i have around 640 rows which will grow in future to thousands and even 10 thousands and more. p  pstrongwhat i didstrongp  ol lipFor implementing the custom paging, i followed Mikes a hrefhttpwww.mikesdotnetting.comArticle71SearchEngineFriendlyCustomPagingwiththeGridViewandLINQtoSQL relnofollowthis articlea and successfully implemented the custom paging on my records. I have a repeater on page and i am bind the data using Take and Skip as directed by Mike.pli lipAfter implementing the paging, i found that its creating 10 records per page so in that case I got 64 pages displayed in my pager, which seems awkward. Its something like this 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 upto 64, killing my page css and ui. Also it is not good , as user point of view. So pli ol  pstrongWhat I want is thatstrongp  pI need SO User section like Pager... see a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comusershereap  pstrongFinally I got solutionsstrongp  pThanks all of you, I got what i needed exactly. I am posting it as an answer below, so that it will help to others  requiring the same.p
Negative 6716 pThe codediffcode program, in its various incarnations, is reasonably good at computing the difference between two text files and expressing it more compactly than showing both files in their entirety.  It shows the difference as a sequence of inserted and deleted chunks of lines or changed lines in some cases, but thats equivalent to a deletion followed by an insertion.  The same or very similar program or algorithm is used by codepatchcode and by source control systems to minimize the storage required to represent the differences between two versions of the same file.  The algorithm is discussed a hrefhttpc2.comcgiwikiDiffAlgorithmherea and a hrefhttpen.wikipedia.orgwikiDiffAlgorithmherea.p  pBut it falls down when blocks of text are emmovedem within the file.p  pSuppose you have the following two files, codea.txtcode and codeb.txtcode imagine that theyre both hundreds of lines long rather than just 6p  precodea.txt   b.txt     1       4 2       5 3       6 4       1 5       2 6       3 codepre  pcodediff a.txt b.txtcode shows thisp  precode diff a.txt b.txt  1,3d0 lt 1 lt 2 lt 3 6a4,6 gt 1 gt 2 gt 3 codepre  pThe change from codea.txtcode to codeb.txtcode can be expressed as Take the first three lines and move them to the end, but codediffcode shows the complete contents of the moved chunk of lines twice, missing an opportunity to describe this large change very briefly.p  pNote that codediff ecode shows the block of text only once, but thats because it doesnt show the contents of deleted lines.p  pIs there a variant of the codediffcode algorithm that a retains codediffcodes ability to represent insertions and deletions, and b efficiently represents moved blocks of text without having to show their entire contentsp

Negative 6716 pIm looking for a design pattern using Akka for the following problem. Say that I have a big file with lots of logged events.

Processing events is independent of each other events.p  pSo my first thought was to use a codeFuture.traversecode call and await the whole list.

Negative 6716 pI am wondering if it is possible to create switch cases with more than 1 value per case. I am trying to take in user input in different ways.

Without making a ridiculous amount of cases, I want to be able to accept all possible inputs. Ie, if the user wants to see 2 databases, they can enter 32 or 23. If they want to see all, it would accept 4, 321, 123, 213...

As you can tell, there are going to be a lot of cases already 7. If I had to list out every single option there would be more than double 16.

Negative 6716 pI have created an ontology in protege. p  pI have a class called AlcoholicBeverage, under this class there are subclasses Beer, Wine. These subclasses are disjoint.p  pI have a class called Person no subclasses. Another class called Behavior with two subclasses PositiveChange and NegativeChange. p  pI have an object property using with two subproperties drinking and consuming. Domain of using property is Person class and range is AlcoholicBeverage class. p  pNegativeChange class has superclass indicated with this statement using some AlcoholicBeverage. p  pWhen I write DL query such as using some Beer or drinking some Beer or consuming some Beer, it should classify it as NegativeChange but it does not. However, it only makes classification when I write using some AlcoholicBeverage which is exactly same definition written in AlcoholicBeverage superclass section. It does not take into account class or object inheritance. I expect that it should classify Beer as Alcoholic beverage or consuming object property as using object property.p  pThanks for your help. p

Negative 6716 pI have a request about choosing template engine, reusable both in Rails and JS, probably only server node.js or client side one, but if it would work for both  it is better of course.p  pCould anyone suggest nice, maintained system, which utilizes normal rails approach partials, collections render, and works well with JS as well. Also, how it should be configured, assuming Rails normally use instance variables with  sign, which isnt valid for JS. I see haml interpreter for Node.js not sure how compatible with normal haml is it.p  pAnother possibility is templates only in JS part, with Rails maintains only data, which rises question about tools for this way  what libraries except bacbone should be checkedp
Negative 6716 pGood evening fellow overflowers, Ive got a little problem that Im attempting to solve but just cant and Im hoping you can help. p  pI have a script that sends strings via cURL to a website. That behaves exactly as expected, and the webpage responds okay. My problem is that theres a set of defines on the website that I want to tap into for illustration purposes, example below. Ive already added a reference to the file where the defines are stored and this works like a charm.p  blockquote   pdefineTABLECOUNTER, counterp blockquote  pLets say all security and mumbojumbo aside my script on the website Im sending to has a simplep  blockquote   pmysqlqueryPOST[aaa]p blockquote  pWhere POST[aaa] would be a valid query. If, on the website in question I were to do the following, the result would executep  blockquote   pmysqlquerySELECT  FROM  . TABLECOUNTERp      pWhich translates intop      pmysqlquerySELECT  FROM counterp blockquote  pHowever I cannot seem to get the script at the website end to execute any sqlquery with a constant defined. Any help would be greatly appreciated Im losing a lot of hair here.p  pThanksp

The tag is captured and the user is redirected successfully. However, the other half of the time, the click event throws an error because the object s is undefined. Im assuming this is due to a timing issue where the location.href fires before the s object has been defined. p  pMy question is, do I want to create a callback so that the location.href doesnt occur until after the tags are set I dont like using setTimeout because the timing feels arbitrary to me. Id rather make sure that the redirect always waits until the tags are fired. p  pDo I want to pass a callback function to the click event Or am I on the wrong track entirely Any solutions to this issue are appreciated.

Negative 6716 pI have a datagridview showing baisc document data Name, type, which the user navigates to access each document. A richtext box shows the first page of each document as navigation occurs. However, since there can be multiple pages per document, the pages are managed in a separate BindingSource so the user can flip through them and make changes.p  pIf the user makes changes to either say the document name or to information on any of the pages, he has 2 choices for saving these, either via an Update button or via navigating to another document in the datagridview.p  pThe button is fine because all binding sources are in a static state.p  pHowever, Im having trouble with the second option since datagridview doesnt offer a row changing event. The RowLeave event isnt appropriate since the user may be in a row, but click over to the richtext box to edit a corresponding page which, of course fires the RowLeave event. I only want to capture an event when the user actually changes document.p  pIve tried the Documents BindingSource CurrentChanged and PositionChanged events but they both occur after the Current pointer has changed so I dont have the correct context for the updates. I could have a global CurrentPosition variable which is used to regain context while I do the updates, but that seems inelegant. Being fairly new to this, Im guessing that Ive missed something so any help would be fantastic.p  pThanks, Jamesp
Negative 6716 pHi all and thanks in advance and sorry for my english,p  pI have several activities which uses several audio features. For that, i have a MediaPlayer in a singletton java class, so the activities interact with that class and just exists one media player.p  pOne of the features is to stop automatically the mediaplayer after X minutes. So i created a timer in the singleton class and stops perfectly the radio streamming. the problem is that there is no feedback or callback to the running activitie. There is a playstop button wich has to change the image and i do not know how can i capture that onStop event  or whatever....or can be called from a single java class the current activity class running, so i could call a function of the activity in order to change the imagep  pBest regards...p

Negative 6716 pI have some stock price data I want to model in MongoDB. Logically each stock price has a date, stock name, and price associated with it. One of the main aims of the application is to model the daily change in stock price.p  pI have two questions associated with this problem.p  p1 What would be the best way to model this sort of data in MongoDB given the sort of queries Ill be running on it.p  pUPDATE Ive done a bit of experimentation and have decided to denormalise the data and make sure I have appropriate column indexes. I didnt actually see any performance difference in nesting the data for the type of queries I was running, and it complicated the process of writing aggregation routines. Thanks for the advice Raxit p  p2 Given 1 What is the best way to write these daily change style queries in MongoDBp  hr  pSo after now I have one document per date and stock.p  precode     stockBob,      date20121201,      price99.99                              ,     stockBob,      date20121202,      price99.99                              ,     stockBob,      date20121203,      price99.99                              ,     stockTed,      date20121201,      price99.99                              ,     stockTed,      date20121202,      price99.99                              ,     stockTed,      date20121203,      price99.99                              ,     .     .     .    codepre  pMy thoughts on 2p  pI want to generate reports that display the daily change in stock prices. Given Document size limitations I may need to split this up to be the deltas per stock and per year or something but that is more of an implementation detail. Essentially I want to output documents of the formp  precode  stockBob,           prices [fromDate20121201,toDate20121202,delta1.0,                      fromDate20121202,toDate20121203,delta1.0,                      .                      .                      .]  ,  stockTed,           prices [fromDate20121201,toDate20121202,delta1.0,                      fromDate20121202,toDate20121203,delta1.0,                      .                      .                      .]  ,  .  .  .  codepre  pIdeally Id like to be able to return this data on an adhoc basis. Im pretty sure this could be done using mapreduce, but I was wondering whether there was a way to do this using the new aggregation framework Before I started researching mongodb Id assumed modelling change in this way would be a faily common use case but so far Ive not come across anything quite like it.p  pAny advice you can give would be extremely useful. Ill update the post as my own research progresses.p  pThanks,p  pMatt.p

Negative 6716 pI am using propertiesmavenplugin to read a external property file under root dir to maintain the version of parent module since there are quite a number of submodules in my project and the dependency tree is kinda deep. It works fine when I build locally and install the artifacts into local repo but got the 401 error when I try to use mvn clean deploy to publish them to Nexus. I am pretty sure this is caused by the ineligible artifact namereleaseurlexternal.version, external.version is supposed to be the property read from the external file. However, it ended up not being read and it just worked fine when I explicitly declare the version in the project.parent.version tag. Any thoughts or workaround or even how you handle the version control when trying to use same version for parent and child in all the modules when dealing with a multimodule porject.p  pThe maven pom for the plugin is as below, I saw some comments online regarding the phase, not sure if it will work if change initialize to something elsep  precode ltplugingt     ltgroupIdgtorg.codehaus.mojoltgroupIdgt         ltartifactIdgtpropertiesmavenpluginltartifactIdgt              ltexecutionsgt                  ltexecutiongt                      ltphasegtinitializeltphasegt                      ltgoalsgt                          ltgoalgtreadprojectpropertiesltgoalgt                      ltgoalsgt                      ltconfigurationgt                             ltfilesgt                                 ltfilegtexternalfile.propertiesltfilegt                             ltfilesgt                     ltconfigurationgt                 ltexecutiongt             ltexecutionsgt     ltplugingt codepre

Negative 6716 pI was just wondering how I could go about using a For loop without using the in keyword in Python p  pSince the in keyword tests to see if a value is in a list, returning True if the value is in the list and False if the value is not in the list, it seems confusing that a For loop uses the In keyword as well when it could just as well use a word like of instead. p  pHowever, I tried to use a code like thisp  precode    for i of range5         print i codepre  pIt returns a syntax error.

Negative 6716 pWhen unittesting with Fluent NHibernate I create a new session for each test, and that session has its own factory that creates a sqlitedatabase where the filename equals the fully qualified testname from the TestContext.

Negative 6716 pIm writing a gem that has to select which version of a XYZ.js file to make available to sprockets code require XYZcode statements based on configuration at app startup. My solution is to copy the codeXYZ.variant.jscode or codeXYZ.variant2.jscode to codetmpcacheltgemnamegtXYZ.jscode in the Rails app. This seems to work if I manually test if I go to the codetestdummycode folder and test the functionality via coderackupcode the codeXYZ.jscode is properly found. If I test the gem via another rails app, it works via codepathcode in Gemfile. p  pBut, when I run the test suite for this gem, it fails, because at some point after the initial copy to codetmpcacheltgemnamegtXYZ.jscode, the whole tmp folder gets cleared, and the only thing in it by the time the test actually gets run is codetmpcacheassetscode. I dont understand how this could be behaving different bw the test suite and the other 2 working methods. Its as if the initialization order is different or something. Is there something special that running via coderackupcode would do that would change the initialization order p  pNote that the test suite worked fine before this particularly addition to the code that did the tmp copying. Its just the normal codeenginexcode code that would have been generated. p

I want the user to be able to add as many input fields into each section as they want. Each of these sections are dynamically created using just a simple php loop based on a value the user imports earlier in the process.p  pI have it so that the form is built, but my problem is with the user being able to addremove the input fields for each section. I have it set so that the php loop creates an input field and addremove buttons for each section. The ids for these items are dynamically created based on the section . When the button is clicked, it calls a javascript function which clones the existing input field and then updates the new fields ids so that it is unique. You can see an example of what I currently have in this JSfiddle a hrefhttpjsfiddle.netNWGUp2 relnofollowhttpjsfiddle.netNWGUp2a please note that since jsfiddle doesnt allow php, I have just included the html for 3 sections with the ids and everything the exact same as the php loop would create. Youll see that the add buttons do not work. p  pIf I just remove sections 2 amp 3, and leave the html for section 1 and all of the javascript the exact same everything works properly as it should a hrefhttpjsfiddle.netNWGUp1 relnofollowhttpjsfiddle.netNWGUp1ap  pSo obviously the problem is all due to having the multiple sections, but I have no idea why since everything was setup to treat each section uniquely by its number identifier.p  pAny idea where Im going wrong I know it might be a bit confusing, so please let me know if any clarification is neededp  pThanks for your helpp  pHere is the javascript Im usingp  precodedocument.readyfunction            .addClass.clickfunction               get ch             var ch  this.attrparam1              var num  .clonedInput.length  how many duplicatable input fields we currently have             var newNum  new Numbernum  1  the numeric ID of the new input field being added              create var which stores the div name             var divName  input  ch    num             alertdivName              create the new element via clone, and manipulate its ID using newNum value             var newElem    divName.clone.attrid, input  ch    newNum                manipulate the nameid values of the input inside the new element             newElem.childrenfirst.attrid, name  ch    newNum.attrname, name  ch    newNum               insert the new element after the last duplicatable input field               divName.afternewElem               enable the remove button             var btnName  btnDel  ch             alertbtnName              btnName.attrdisabled,                    .delClass.clickfunction               get ch             var ch  this.attrparam1              var num  .clonedInput.length  how many duplicatable input fields we currently have             input  ch    num.remove  remove the last element               if only one element remains, disable the remove button             if num1  1                   btnDelch.attrdisabled,disabled                  codepre  pand html w all 3 sectionsp  precodeltform idmyFormgt      lth2gtSECTION 1lth2gt      ltdiv idinput11 classclonedInput stylemarginbottom4pxgtfile path         ltinput idname11 typetext namename11gt     ltdivgt     ltdivgt         ltinput idbtnAdd1 classaddClass typebutton param11 valueAdd Anothergt         ltinput idbtnDel1 classdelClass typebutton param11 valueRemove Lastgt     ltdivgt     ltbr gt     ltbr gt             lth2gtSECTION 2lth2gt     ltdiv idinput21 classclonedInput stylemarginbottom4pxgtfile path         ltinput idname21 typetext namename21gt     ltdivgt     ltdivgt         ltinput idbtnAdd2 classaddClass typebutton param12 valueAdd Anothergt         ltinput idbtnDel2 classdelClass typebutton param12 valueRemove Lastgt     ltdivgt     ltbr gt     ltbr gt             lth2gtSECTION 3lth2gt     ltdiv idinput31 classclonedInput stylemarginbottom4pxgtfile path         ltinput idname31 typetext namename31gt     ltdivgt     ltdivgt         ltinput idbtnAdd3 classaddClass typebutton param13 valueAdd Anothergt         ltinput idbtnDel3 classdelClass typebutton param13 valueRemove Lastgt     ltdivgt ltformgt codepre  pand html w only 1st sectionp  precodeltform idmyFormgt     ltdiv idinput11 classclonedInput stylemarginbottom4pxgtfile path         ltinput idname11 typetext namename11gt     ltdivgt     ltdivgt         ltinput idbtnAdd1 classaddClass typebutton param11 valueAdd Anothergt         ltinput idbtnDel1 classdelClass typebutton param11 valueRemove Lastgt     ltdivgt     ltbr gt     ltbr gt  ltformgt codepre

Negative 6716 pI made a flyout window in the notification area using WinAPI and my goal was to make it similar to the flyout windows that show up when you click some of the icons in the notification area, like the Volume icon.p  pI already succeeded in making it look and behave similar to the other ones, but there is one thing I cant seem to figure out.

For example, if I set the Windows Classic theme this area should be grey and not blue.p  pSo, my question is, am I missing something in how this can be achieved without painting the window manually. I noticed that the details pane in Explorer windows in Win 7 has the same look. Ive searched quite a bit for answers but I havent found anything yet. This is my first time doing a GUI using the WinAPI so I have very little experience, and therefore Im assuming there is something that I just dont know about.p  pstrongUPDATEstrongp  pI did manage to figure out how to draw this area without painting it manually.

Negative 6716 pIm writing a game for a video game course which unfortunately taught nothing, and Im having trouble designing the interactions between the game entities and the class that actually runs the game.p  pMy problem reduces pretty much to this assuming an entity has a position, it shouldnt be able to modify it directly instead having to wait for the game manager to run a game step, but it should be able to access it, to run AI checks and so on.p  pMy solution would be to create a codePositioncode class that is friend with codeGameManagercode, and to create an entity class like thisp  precodeclass Entity      public         Position amp getPosition  return pos      private         Position pos  codepre  pSo the manager would be able to modify the entities positions but other classes would only be able to observe. However this reasoning would hold for lots and lots of other properties, and since the entity class is actually derived into a series of subclasses, which have more and more properties, I would have to put the codefriendcode attribute almost everywhere.p  pWhat would be a better approach to solve this problemp

When I debug the javascript it calculates the correct amount for totalItemWidth in my case 717px, if I dont debug or skip the part where it calculates the totalItemWidth it sometimes comes up with 658px.p  pIm not sure if thats a loading issue, or if theres something else going on.p  pI would be happy if anybody could give me a little insight.p  pCheers Carlop

Negative 6716 pI have a Selenium IDE script that reads a commaseparated list of values from an HTML file that I maintain, and stores this in a variable using storeSelectOptions. Then later, the script compares the contents of that variable with the options in a select element droplist on a page, using verifySelectOptions. The point of the script is to verify that the select element contains all the right values. p  pThis works for all my droplists except one that contains a comma within one of the items. Since my variable contains a list of commaseparated items, this is a problem. When the variable is stored, it seems to escape the internal comma with a backslash, but then the verify operation fails because Selenium doesnt think that the two elements match. In other words, Selenium sees the droplist on the page asp  precodeRed, Green, Blue, Dark codepre  pand it sees the variable asp  precodeRed, Green, Blue, Dark codepre  pAny thoughts as to how to fix thisp  pThanks, Johnp

Negative 6716 pi cant find any good architecture explanation of how can WCF SHOULD be part of a mainserver with multiple clients.br in my solution, i want to have a central WCF service hosted in windowsservice on windows server machine.br The central service is the only one thats connected to the DB.br all the clients, are connecting to this main service, login, and get having a duplex communication.br via that main service, one client can connect another one. or when one client using the main service to change the DB, the main service updates all other clients.  p  pfor doing that, i added in the main service the codeInstanceContextMode.Singlecode attribute, and in the windowsservice, i init ServiceHost with the WCFservice singleton.  p  pit works. so so..br i can continue and search where the problems are, and how to fix them, but it looks like something here is not right, like im not supposed to do it this way.  p  pi could really use an advice on how WCF service should be used as a main service with multiple clients, that require common memory.  its basically for 20 clients with not too intensive operations, but i still want the option to let them all communicate simultaneously with the main service, and not only one by one. p

Negative 6716 pIm working on a project which requires putting 2 or more strings in one space in a 2D array. For example from index i0, j0, store 4,5,6, and 7 in that particular space.

Negative 6716 pIm using extjs3 and PHP to develop an application and its a custom framework. Im having grids to list records from any particular table. But if any columnfield in the grid has quite a large text ex notes field with a text like my name is xyz and im from abc. My DOB is bla bla bla, then in this case it appears as my name is ...... and to see the rest of the text I have to stretch that column and which is very irritating. Thats why I was thinking of adding some scroll bar to that field in the grid. Please let me know if you have any alternate solutions for this case or how to use the scroll bar here.

Negative 6716 pIm trying to make a level select screen, and instead of copy and pasting a bunch of level select buttons onto my level select screen, I wanted to try to create and position the buttons using code for a little more flexibility in the future. Ive run into a few problems while doing this...the main problem being that my custom navigation events, for whatever reason, fail to bubble up to my main document class from my button class. p  pIve used over 20 navigation events in my project, so Im pretty  certain the problem is not my method of doing navigation events as a whole, but the problem is specific to using a button class. Or something else Im missing. Anyhow, Ill post the code below. I performed a few traces to try and figure out what was going on. My custom navigation events class is creating the proper event, then my button class is dispatching the event, but the the code that listens for this event in my document class never runs. So Im assuming theres some kind of problem in bubbling the navigation event up to the top. Thats my best guess, could be something completely different. If you guys also have different suggestions about how to make my level select screen work better by completely restructuring what Ive done, thats fine too...but this has been somewhat of a mystery and I was hoping to get it working this way.

Negative 6716 pA property in codeViewModelcode, that is bound to an element in codeViewcode, usually takes value from some model class instance and when the value is updated in the codeViewcode, the property propagates the change of the value into the underlying model class instance.br p  pHowever in case when you have a property in codeViewModelcode returning e.g. an codeObservableCollectioncode that is constructed from values from the model, the change of the values in the codeViewcode only changes the values in the ObservableCollection. It does not propagate the change of values into the underlying model class instance.p  pSo for example, you have a modal dialog  the codeViewcode, you display this dialog together with its datacontext codeViewModelcode and the ViewModel contains an instance of a model class.  Nowp  ul lipstrongsituation Astrong you have a ViewModel that has only properties that return noncollection types int, string ..., when you close the dialog  you know that the model class instance has the updated values.pli lipstrongsituation Bstrong you have a ViewModel that has a property exposing an ObservableCollectionlt, when you close the dialog, the model class instance does not contain the updated values.pli ul  pstrongWhat is the common patternpractice of dealing with thisstrongbr  I thought you could have a method that writes the data that are present in codeViewModelcode into the Model instance and call this method when the dialog closes. But this seems unnatural to me with the philosophy of MVVM and WPF so far.p  pPlease keep in mind that the before mentioned example is just an example.

To do this, we are offsetting the specified shape inward by the radius of the bit and then back outward that same amount, thus rounding out any parts that would be too skinny to actually fit the bit into. For the polygon offsetting, we are using Angus Johnsons a hrefhttpwww.angusj.comdelphiclipper.php relnofollowClippera library, version 5.1.6 c.p  pBut as can be seen in the picture this is resulting in some unexpected shapes.

Anyway, using my actual data, your query returned  p  precodeaid    sid    Qty    0       0       14   0       6       1   1       0       14   1       6       1   2       0       14   2       5       1   3       0       14   3       6       1   4       0       14   4       6       1   5       0       14   5       6       1   6       0       14   6       6       1   7       0       14   7       6       1   8       0       14   8       7       1   codepre  petc ...p  pThis is way nearer than I got. All 17 aid values are present and the total sid values  for each aid 141 are corerect as there are 15 people but sid values of zero should not be there and more values of 5 should be. Ill see if I can work out whats missing.p  pCheers,p  pEdit 2, successp  pMany many thanks to Daniel B, who provided me with the much needed answer not much hair left. A very slight tweek to the query provided by Daniel B probably because of my inabillity to explain properly, i.e. moving the sid filter WHERE sid lt 0 into the subquery has done the trick. It resulted in this  p  precodeSELECT rs.aid, rs.sid, COUNTrs.sid Qty   FROM resultset rs   INNER JOIN   SELECT pid, aid, MAXtid tid FROM resultset WHERE sid ltgt 0 GROUP BY pid, aid X   ON rs.pidX.pid AND rs.aidX.aid AND rs.tid  X.tid   INNER JOIN people p ON p.pid  rs.pid   WHERE p.pgen  1   GROUP BY rs.aid, rs.sid   Order by aid   codepre  pI now need to study it to understand fully whats going on. Thanks again Daniel B.p

I dont mind whether this is solved via a formula or a script. p  pTo begin with I will provide the big picture. I have a whole bunch of SQL Queries that call on various fields from different locations. These field titles have now changed. I would like to update the SQL Queries with the new names of the fields. As such, I was going to copy all the queries into an excel spreadsheet and then lookup the field names in the string and replace them with the new field names from a table in another sheet. The problem is that there is approximately 10 field names per query that need replacing.p  pSo this is what I was thinking. Essentially, if I have a string in cell A1 with the words We are the very best. For every word that exists in the string I would like to check if it exists in a table in another sheet. If the word exists in the table, replace it. If not then move onto the next word. Continue for every word in the cell. p  pAny help that can be provided is very much appreciated. Thanks in advance p

From what Ive read, it seems that the easiest way to do this that would suit my needs would be to create an SQLite database containing the paths to the files along with their top level metadata.  p  pSince I dont have much experience with databases, Im wondering what the best practices for maintaining such a database which will be used by about five other people would be.  Should I simply write a script that would be run each time a file is added to the database, copying HDF5 metadata into an SQLite table Any advice would be greatly appreciated.  p  pIm also wondering if in general this how HDF5 files are used, or whether it would be common to put all of ones data in a single HDF5 file, taking the place of a database.   p

Negative 6716 pstrongBusiness Catalyst Web App Import Classifications Columnstrongp  pThis is slightly bizarre question which I am hoping someone can help me with. Ive created a Web App in my clients Business Catalyst system. The web app will have many items all classified to appear on one or multiple pages. p  pColumn J in the CSV file to be imported into Business Catalyst is the Classifications column which allows you to assign a Category to the item. This is all well and good except I cannot appear to assign multiple categories to each item. I have attempted to differentiate each category by a comma without a space, with a space, using a pipe and splitting it over 2 lines...to no avail.p  pDoes anybody have any idea how to do this, I dont want their Web Administrator to have to manually assign the categories if I can help it.p

Negative 6716 pI am currently analyzing a memory leakexcessive memory usage issue in a large node.js application. One of the things I tried is looking at the V8 heap beforeafter certain operations, using the codeheapdumpcode node module and the comparison view in Chrome dev tools.

I am reading from this output that between the two heap dump calls, all of the JS code in string form presumably stored somewhere in nodes module cacherequire mechanism gets garbage collected and immediately loaded again.

Negative 6716 pIm having an ongoing debate with myself about how to think about and use Docker containers. p  pFrom the literature and examples it seems like a container should really provide a service, or part of a stack. For example a container might run MySQL, or Apache, or redis, or whatever. I can understand why this is nice and clean, and makes sense.p  pIn our scenario, we want to host multiple totally separate web applications ecommerce stores, wordpress sites, static websites, node.js applications all on the same server, and we want to use Docker. For me therefore it makes more sense for each container to be totally selfcontainer, with the entire stack in itself e.g. each of my possibly several running wordpress containers would each have their own LAMP installation. p  pTo apply the onecontaineroneservice model to this scenario seems to be very complicated  each application will have dependencies on other containers in the system which will in turn be depended on by other things. And what if you require multiple versions of a particular service.p  pWhilst this seems like the way to go, it also seems like it could be very inefficient Im not an expert on how LXCs work but even though everything is containerised, there really are all those apache2 workers and mysqlds running on the system, with all their associated overhead  is there going to be performance problemsp  pDoes anyone have any thoughtsp
Negative 6716 pIm prototyping an ASP.NET Web API that needs to talk to several databases which are almost identical. Each of our customers have their own instance of our database structure, but some are specialized to integrate with other systems they have. So for example in one database the codeClientcode table might have the column codeAbcIDcode to reference a table in another system, but other databases wont have this column. Other than that the two tables are identical in name and columns. The columns can also have different lengths, codevarchar50code instead of codevarchar40code for example. And in some databases there can be one extra table. I have focused on solving the different columns problem first.p  pI was hoping to use an ORM to handle the data access layer of the API, and right now Im experimenting with Entity framework. I already solved how to dynamically connect to the different databases from an APIcall, but right now they have to be completely identical in structure.p  pI have tried to set up double .edmx models with a Databasefirst approach but this causes conflicting class names between the models. So instead I tried Codefirst and come up with this which isnt working.p  pstrongDbContext extensionstrong In the constructor I check which database is being accessed and if it is one of the special ones I flag it for the model configuration.p  precodepublic partial class MKDatabaseEntities  DbContext       private string dbType  dbTypeDefault     public DbSetltClientgt Client  get set      public DbSetltResourcegt Resource  get set       public MKDatabaseEntitiesstring companycode          baseGetConnectionStringcompanycode              ifcompanycode  Foo             this.dbType  dbType1            Add model configurations     protected override void OnModelCreatingDbModelBuilder modelBuilder              modelBuilder.Conventions.RemoveltPluralizingTableNameConventiongt         modelBuilder.Configurations         .Addnew ClientConfigurationdbType         .Addnew ResourceConfiguration           public static string GetConnectionStringstring companycode              string dbName  MK  companycode           Start out by creating the SQL Server connection string         SqlConnectionStringBuilder sqlBuilder  new SqlConnectionStringBuilder          sqlBuilder.DataSource  Properties.Settings.Default.ServerName         sqlBuilder.UserID  Properties.Settings.Default.ServerUserName         sqlBuilder.Password  Properties.Settings.Default.ServerPassword           The name of the database on the server         sqlBuilder.InitialCatalog  dbName         sqlBuilder.IntegratedSecurity  false          sqlBuilder.ApplicationName  EntityFramework         sqlBuilder.MultipleActiveResultSets  true          string sbstr  sqlBuilder.ToString         return sbstr       codepre  pstrongClientConfigurationstrong In the configuration for codeClientcode I check the flag before mapping properties to database columns. emThis however does not seem to work.emp  precodepublic class ClientConfiguration  EntityTypeConfigurationltClientgt      public ClientConfigurationstring dbType              HasKeyk gt k.Id         Propertyp gt p.Id         .HasColumnNameID         .HasDatabaseGeneratedOptionDatabaseGeneratedOption.Identity         if dbType  dbType1                      Propertyp gt p.AbcId.HasColumnNameAbcID                  Propertyp gt p.FirstName.HasColumnNameFirstName         Propertyp gt p.LastName.HasColumnNameLastName                 codepre  pstrongClient classstrong This is how my codeClientcode class looks like, nothing weird here.p  precodepublic class Client  IIdentifiable      public int Id  get set      public string AbcId  get set      public string FirstName  get set      public string LastName  get set    public interface IIdentifiable      int Id  get   codepre  pBackup solution is to use raw SQL queries to deal with the offending tables and ORM for the rest, but it would be awesome if there is some way to do this that I have not thought of.

Negative 6716 pFolks, p  pI have the following challenge, I would like to deploy an Applet which relies on Java 1.8 syntax into hundreds of client workstations already running an old Java Applet which relies on Java 1.5p  pThe problem is, I do not have access to the Java 1.5 Applet code and even not to its launcher Html page. Alas, this launcher Html page relies on the Applet tag and will therefore attempts to load the most recent Java plugin version installed on the workstation. I dont like to rely on any virtualization solution, I have to run as a Java Applet, perhaps Web Start can be considered if you think it would help. p  pMy questions are Is there a local workstation configurationhack to tell the browser to load a specific old Java version when rendering the Applet tag  Otherwise, is there a way to use Java Web Start to workaround this problem and somehow run my newer Java Applet without updating the official workstation Java plugin version p

Negative 6716 pEclipse seems to be generating a lot of these unnecessary warnings about JavaDoc in my code, and I cant seem to be able to get rid of the warnings.p  pFirst of all, the warnings dont make sense. These appear in links, likep  pre classlangjava prettyprintoverridecode   link Foobar   codepre  pWhere codeFoo.barcode definitely exists. Eclipse can find it via right click  open declaration. The field is codeprotectedcode.p  pAt first, I thought it was because codeFoocode inherits from another class, which is where codebarcode actually belongs, but changing the link to the super class doesnt remove the warning.p  pAll the warnings are for the same field. Ive tried accessing it in different ways including codeFoobarcode, codeSuperClassbarcode, codebarcode, and the fully qualified name.p  pI used to have enabled JavaDoc warnings in Java  Compiler  Javadoc, but have since disabled them. The project settings are also disabled.p  pThe code base is using Java 8, which changed how Javadoc warnings and errors work, so it may be related to this the JavaDoc cant be created by Eclipse because of errors in the Javadoc, presumably caused by Java 8, but we only use Eclipses JavaDoc on hover, anyway.p  pI have two pieces of additional software installed in Eclipse m2e v1.5 and CodePro v7.1.p  pcodemvn compilecode has no warnings, so Im pretty sure that this is an Eclipse issue. Using Eclipse 4.4. Ive tried restarting and rebuilding the project several times.p  pThe warnings only show up in the problems view if I choose Show  Show all. Ticking all the individual show options does not display these warnings. Theyre still displayed in the editor, though.p

Negative 6716 pI have an existing application that doesnt use emberjs, and am looking at doing a rewrite of the front end. I would like to incorporate emberjs into the project using embercli. While not a single page app the application only has 4 pages, each have allot going on, very heavy JS, so I thought it would make sense to make an emberjs app for each of the four pages, that way I could migrate pagebypage.p  pSo the first page I was looking at migrating is the simplest of the four, a account page where account detailssettings etc can be modified. This is what Ive donep  pWent into my js directory of my app which has all the legacy code I intend to migrate ran codeember new accountcode to create an embercli app in the account directory. After that I ran codeember buildcode to build my project, the compiled files were added to accountdist . I then linked to the two JS files created in accountdistassets like sop      pNow I see that embercli does create its own index.html inside dist, but I will not be using that. Im thinking I can just remove some of the stuff that I dont need before deployment.p  pMy question is, does it seem like I am on the right path here Is there any reason I shouldnt be trying to do what I am doing now Are there more things I need to consider than just linking to the account.js and vendor.js scripts Ive done a fair bit of Googling but since these tools are still pretty new I didnt find much that was relevant to what I am trying to do.Any advice would be appreciated. Thanks muchp

Negative 6716 pI wrote an orbit propagator calculates position and velocity of a satellite for each time step in matlab and its pretty accurate 4.5 km in a 24hour propagation. I had to rewrite it in C, I did it and its working properly but my results are much less accurate 450 km for a 24hour propagation, so I was wondering what could cause this loss of accuracy in C for the exact same calculations I compared the scripts to be sure I didnt forget anything. p  pAll my variables are double or long double depending on the needs. There are no divisions by ints. The error grows linearly over time.p  pMy main function contains a while loop that updates the values of my position and velocity arrays by calling the calculating function that takes pointers to the arrays as arguments.p

Negative 6716 pI am writing a reporting tool that allows users to check certain servers with a single click on their mouses. p  pBasically, I have a PHP script called codecheckserver.phpcode. This file needs 1 parameter, named serverNode. For example codecheckserver.phpserverNode1234code. This script returns either true or false. False means that the server is down.p  pNow, what I am trying to achieve is to have a simple 2column table with all the servernodes listed in the first column. When the user clicks report, then I want to make a Ajax call for every row in the table. So, first codecheckserver.phpserverNode1code, then codecheckserver.phpserverNode5code etc. etc. Then a success or failed icon is shown for every row. p  pHow can I do this The next node may only be checked, if the previous one returns true of false. Does somebody have an clear example Thanks in advancep

Negative 6716 pI am working on a source code repository that generates some C code by running a python script outputting headers and implementation.

At the moment, I am using codeexecuteprocesscode to fire off the generator.

But since two Days  I have a very strange problem, my source code now has around 11000 lines and my java main class got a size of around 600 kb. My problem is when I try to add anymore lines of code like if statements I get a Fatal Error  The strange thing is if I add a if statement anywhere in the code but therefore also remove an other if statement the code works again perfectlyp  precode1018 103202.925 Alibc26337 Fatal signal 11 SIGSEGV at 0x00000104 code1, thread 26344 Compiler  0x0... sometimes changes codepre  pand my App crashes it got nothing to do with the source code itself I think because it loads up everything perfectly and strangely it shouldnt even check the if Statement in the normal render code, just after a user interaction.

Negative 6716 pI noted that much of boost and libclibstdc explicitly provide a default value of zero for SFINAE in code likep  precode libc httpllvm.orgsvnllvmprojectlibcxxtrunkincludememory namespace haspointertypeimp      template ltclass Upgt static two test...     template ltclass Upgt static char testtypename Uppointer  0   template ltclass Tpgt struct haspointertype      public integralconstantltbool, sizeofhaspointertypeimptestltTpgt0  1gt   codepre  pHowever it confuses me as to why this would be expected when they explicitly make the call with 0. I remember hearing somewhere it was an optimization to speed up the compiler when instantiating the template but I dont fully understand how that would work. I looked at the standard and it has a section that briefly describes what happens with defaultarguments in relation to template argument deduction.p  pstrong14.8.2strongp  blockquote   pAt certain points in the template argument deduction process it is necessary to take a function type that makes use of template parameters and replace those template parameters with the corresponding template arguments. This is done at the beginning of template argument deduction when any explicitly specified template arguments are substituted into the function type, and again at the end of template argument deduction when any template arguments that were deduced or obtained from default arguments are substituted.p blockquote  pThe last bit there sounds concerning to my questionp  blockquote   pand again at the end of template argument deduction when any template arguments that were deduced or obtained from default arguments are substituted.p blockquote  pHowever that sounds like the opposite of an optimization if it has to do more work. Does anyone have any reasoning why that 0 must be there, it works without it, but every single example of SFINAE in libc at least seems to explicitly put 0 there, even though they never call the function with no arguments.p

Negative 6716 pWe are processing a filetype on hadoop which is not splitable.  Meaning that there will be one mapper per file.  Each file is several factors larger than our default blocksize.

So next I tried sending a basic 5byte array using the following codep  precodeasync void BLEfunc              PeerFinder.AlternateIdentities[BluetoothPaired]           var peers  await PeerFinder.FindAllPeersAsync          if peers.Count  0                      Details.Text  No Device Found                  else                      PeerInformation selectedPeers  peers[0]             StreamSocket socket  new StreamSocket             await socket.ConnectAsyncselectedPeers.HostName, 1             Details.Text  Connected to device   selectedPeers.DisplayName  Details is a TextBlock on screen              using var dataWriter  new DataWritersocket.OutputStream                              byte[] DataArray   1, 2, 3, 4, 5                  dataWriter.WriteByte1                 var result  await dataWriter.StoreAsync                 dataWriter.DetachStream                          Details.Text  Data sent               codepre  pThe problem is that the program runs into an unhandled exception when it enters the using code block in the above pasted code. Everything up to that point runs fine. I got the idea for the above code from here a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions22140947sendingfilesviabluetoothfromwinrttoandroidwpdevicesSending files via bluetooth from winRT to android  WP devicesap  pAny ideas p
Negative 6716 pI have a short question... I implemented a mysql request into my android application, which gives me the error, whenever I want to get data from mysqlp  precodeltDOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC IETFDTD HTML 2.0ENgt lthtmlgtltheadgt lttitlegt403 Forbiddenlttitlegt ltheadgtltbodygt lth1gtForbiddenlth1gt ltpgtYou dont have permission to access ...example.php on this server.ltpgt lthrgt codepre  pWhat I am asking myself is, why the request does work over a web browser where I can get all the data from mysql using the same example.php  but the same stuff does not work when I want to get the data from the android application with JSONParser  HttpRequest..p  pis that an error from the application itself or is there any option my hoster have to change in the php.in if yes why does the call work with a webbrowser thenp

Negative 6716 pIve recently gotten into Rx and Im using it to help me pull data from several APIs in a data mining application.p  pI have an interface that I implement for each API, which encapsulates common calls to each API, e.g.p  precodepublic interface IMyApi       IObservableltstringgt GetApiName Cold feed for getting the APIs name.      IObservableltintgt GetNumberFeed Hot feed of numbers from the API   codepre  pMy question is around cold IObservables vs Tasks. In my mind, a cold observable is basically a task, they operate in much the same way. It strikes me as strange to be abstracting a Task away as a cold observable, when you could argue that a Task is all you need. Also using a cold observable to wrap Tasks hides the nature of the activity, since the signature looks the same as a hot observable.p  pAnother way I could represent the above interface isp  precodepublic interface IMyApi       Taskltstringgt GetApiNameAsync Async method for getting the APIs name.      IObservableltintgt GetNumberFeed Hot feed of numbers from the API   codepre  pIs there some conventional wisdom on why I shouldnt mix and match between Tasks and IObservablesp  pEdit To clarify  Ive read the other discussions posted and understand the relationship between Rx and TPL, but my concerns are mainly about whether or not its strongsafestrong to combine the two in an application and whether it can lead to bad practice or threading and scheduling pitfallsp
Negative 6716 pHello everyone I would like to kindly advice on the strategy to be used. I have a database with 34,000 points of interest to be included as an annotation in the MapKit. now I decided to create a webservice that returns a json for these elimenti. My problem is that I can not put 34,000 points of interest otherwise my application would become very slow. I would ask if anyone had the same problem. Which strategy to use Thanks.p

Negative 6716 pI have considered the matrix of numbers as the mapping of plane points to their values and then draw the isoline. I have practised the contour function from the following module matplitlib.pylab and I have succeeded in configurating it as I wanted, but there is one exeption.  The contourf set a step by default and it designates the values on the Yaxis and Xaxis. I would like to change it. Is it possible I have read all of the documentation about the contour function but I havent found the solution. I am a beginner. This is my codep  precodeplt.figure cs  plt.contourm.Z, levelsA, colorsK, linestylessolid plt.clabelcs, A[12], inline0.5, fmt1.0f, fontsize10 plt.colorbarcs, shrink1 plt.show codepre  pm.Z is my matrix and plt is matplotlib.pylab I have tried to change the step giving the values of vectors  X and Y in contour  I know that they arent needed but it doesnt work.p

Negative 6716 pIm trying to implement a timer routine in 32bit assembler on OS X Lion using sigaction amp setitimer system calls.  The idea is to set a timer using setitimer amp then have the generated alarm signal invoke a handler function previously setup through sigaction.  I have such a mechanism working on Linux, but cannot seem to get it working on OS X.  I know the system call convention is different between OS X amp Linux, and that OS X has a 16 byte alignment requirement.  Despite compensating for these, Im still not able to get it working usually a Bus error 10 error.  Thinking I did something wrong with the alignment, I wrote a simple C program that does what I want amp then used clang 3.2 to generate the assembly code.

I either get the bus error, a segmentation fault, or the code just hangs without calling the handler function.  p  pOne thing I did notice during debugging is that the sigaction call appears to have a lengthy wrapper around the underlying system call.  If you disassemble both functions from within lldb, you will see sigaction has a lengthy wrapper but setitimer does not.  Not sure this means anything, but perhaps the sigaction wrapper is massaging the data before passing it along.  I tried debugging that code, but havent found anything definitive yet.p  pIf anyone knows how to get the above assembly code working by replacing the sigaction amp setitimer functions with the appropriate system calls, it would be greatly appreciated.  I can then take those changes amp apply them to my handcoded routines.p  pThanks.p  pUpdate I stripped down my handwritten assembly code to a manageable size amp was able to get it working using the sigaction amp setitimer library calls, but still havent figured out why the syscalls dont work.

This snippet from dtruss seems to suggest the samep  pWith sigaction syscall not workingp  precodesigaction0xE, 0x2030, 0x0       0 0 setitimer0x0, 0x2020, 0x0       0 0 codepre  pWith sigaction library call workingp  precodesigaction0xE, 0xBFFFFC40, 0x0   0 0 setitimer0x0, 0x2028, 0x0       0 0 codepre  pAs you can see, the 2nd argument is different between the two versions.  It seems the address of the sigaction structure 0x2030 is passed directly when using the syscall, but something else is passed when using the library call.  Im guessing that the something else is generated in the sigaction library function.p  pUpdate 3 I discovered that the same exact problem exists on FreeBSD 9.1.  The setitimer syscall works, but the sigaction syscall does not.  Like OS X, the sigaction library call does work.p  pBSD has a few sigaction syscalls  so far, Ive only tried the same one I was using in OS X  0x2e.  Perhaps one of the other sigaction syscalls will work.  Knowing that BSD has the same behavior will make this easier to track down, as I can pull the C source code.  Plus this opens the problem up to a much wider group of people who may already know what the problem is.p  pBased on my understanding of how syscalls work coupled with the fact that sigaction does work on Linux, I cant help but to think I am doing something wrong in my code.  However, the fact that replacing the int 0x80 call with the sigaction library function causes my code to work seems to contradict this.  There is an entire chapter on assembly language programming in the FreeBSD developer manual, as well as a section on making system calls, so what Im doing should be possiblep  pa hrefhttpswww.freebsd.orgdocenUS.ISO88591booksdevelopershandbookx86systemcalls.html relnofollowhttpswww.freebsd.orgdocenUS.ISO88591booksdevelopershandbookx86systemcalls.htmlap  pUnless someone can point out what, if anything, I am doing wrong, I think the next step is for me to look at the BSD sources for sigaction.  As I mentioned previously, I looked at the disassembled version of sigaction on OS X amp found it to be quite lengthy compared to other syscalls amp filled with magic numbers.  Hopefully looking at the C code will make clear what its doing that causes it to work.  In the end, it could be something as simple as passing in the wrong sigaction struct there are several of them or failing to set some bit somewhere.p

Negative 6716 pMy program generates what might be called switchx sequences. p  pHeres a description the algorithm that produces them p  precode define a switchx sequence of length n2 def switchx     s  []                                      define a bit string s     s.appendrandom.choice[True, False]      set its first bit randomly,     for i in range1, n  n                   but for every subsequent bit i,         prior  s[i1]                          find its prior bit i1,         shouldSwitch  x gt random.random      and with probability 1x,         if shouldSwitch s.appendnot prior    set i to opposite of its prior         else s.appendprior                   otherwise, have i  its prior.     return s codepre  pAt x  .5, the sequence is thought to be a perfectly random sequence of bits. Deviating x distorts this randomness by producing sequences that either alternate or repeat bits too often. p  pI produced a program that computed the average alternation rate of a produced switchx sequence.p  precoder  0.0 for i in rangelens1     if s[i]  s[i1]         r  r  1 rate  rlens1 codepre  pOf course, I always obtain a rate relatively close to x when I put a switchx sequence through it, whatever x is. Like, within 1100ths.p  pBut suppose I transform my produced switchx sequence like so where lens  nnp  precodes1  switchx s2  [] for i in rangen     for j in rangen         s2.appends1[i  jn] codepre  pWhenever I calculate the alternation rate for sequences transformed in this way, I always obtain a value really close to .5 The consistency is scary. p  pThat doesnt make much sense to me, especially for values of x that are very close to 0 or 1. So I was hoping you could help me figure out whats going wrong. p  pSorry if somethings terrible about my styleefficiency. p

For now I am using a complicated, badly written where function, which you a hrefhttpjsfiddle.netskx3mxom relnofollowcould see herea. Unfortunately, this works really slow. I am sending a request when the user has typed another symbol and their length is  3, so this should work as a dynamic search and bring results very quickly. p  pAnother problem is that I didnt really come up with a way to find similar results, but I guess this includes a more complex logic than the one I have for now. Any suggestionsp  pBasically, the user is requesting to dynamicSearchsearchString and on the server it should look somewhat like this, but more advanced, finding similar results and working for parts of namesp  precodeUsers.ensureIndex  firstName text   Users.ensureIndex  lastName text   Users.find     text         search req.params.searchString       codepre  pP.S.

Negative 6716 pIm using Python 2.7 and Selenium 2440 on Windows 7.  Im looking for a quicker way of inputting text than using sendkeys.  Sendkeys will print 1 letter at a time which better imitates an actual user.  I would like a way to print all of them out at once, as if the content was pasted.  p  pFor example, Sikuli has the following functionalityp  precodepastethis will all populate the field at the same time codepre  pIm wondering if theres a way to write a method in Python that will have the same result.  So, instead ofp  precodeel.sendkeysthis will do 1 letter at a time codepre  pHave something like p  precodeel.pastekeysthis will do the entire line at once codepre  pSince the above command would require adding code to selenium functionality, it would prob make more sense to have a python method.  Maybe something along the lines ofp  precodedef pastekeysself, xpath, text     os.environ[CLIPBOARD]  text     el  self.driver.findelementbyxpathxpath     el.sendkeysKeys.CONTROL, v codepre  pUsing that environmental variable doesnt actually act as a copy, though, and I dont know how to set the clipboard from the code level without downloading 3rd party software.p
Negative 6716 pI want to present the data from my database in a fairly readable and organized fashion.

Its important that each users input is separate i.e. not listed as a table but I dont need it to say Array or even list the column number [0]  25 with the arrow for example. How do I get rid of these elements I can play around with the font etc after, but I dont know how to get rid of the other stuff. I guess its probably how im fetching the datap  precode pdo  new PDO mysqldbnamedbnamehosthost , user , password    if  pdo     echo ltpregt foreach pdogtquery select  from survey  as k    printr k       codepre  pMaybe theres a way for me to pull each column in the database separately i.e. ask it to bring in ID, then to bring in storename etc I tried doing some research but every record takes me to the formatted example above and I cant believe anyone wants to display their data like that. p

Both gridviews are querying from the same table but with different SELECT statements as each gridview is concerned with different items in the same table row.p  pI thought I had somewhat accomplished this by reading the primary key from the GVRandomBars and placing that value in a LabellblRandomBar that I use as a control for gvPicsRandomBar to match up the correct pic to display in its own gridview as they both query the same database, but I was wrong. Whenever I startup my website I get this error Index was out of range. Must be nonnegative and less than the size of the collection. Parameter name index. Im just not sure where to place this code i.e. Event codelblRandomBar.Text  GVRandomBars.DataKeys0.Value.ToStringcode so that I will not get the above error.p  h2Seperate problems if by miracle I get it to workh2  pOne problem I have is that it appears that the value of the primary key is not passed on to lblRandomBar.text. I assume this is because I do not know where to correctly place the code codelblRandomBar.Text  GVRandomBars.DataKeys0.Value.ToStringcodeThe other problem I do have when I sometimes get it to work is that the picture displayed in gvPicsRandomBar is one step behind from when I click the search button. Example, I click search for city Austin in my dropdown list which could potentially give me a primary key value of 45. The picture for that primary key is not displayed until I click search for another city in the dropdown list and the page posts back to the server.p  pThe value of the primary key is in lblRandomBar.text for the current bar displayed in the GVRandomBars but the picture of the bar associated with that recored does not appear in the gvPicsRandomBar until the search button is clicked and another random bar is displayed in the GVRandomBars. So I am looking at a picture in gvPicsRandomBar from the last bar that was brought up in GVRandomBars while another bars information is currently displayed in GVRadnomBars.p  pI am looking to have the same bar information and bar picture in both gridviews at the same time, and not one step behind like I have currently with the picture in gvPicsRandomBar. Any help would be greatly appreciated.

Negative 6716 pI have a jsp website that has a menu bar. Upon clicking the logout button, the page redirects to the welcome jsp page. However, I hope to make it so that once the user clicks logout, the welcome page now has a div with some span that reads You have successfully logged out. I have been trying to get this to work, but to no avail.p  pIn my javascript, I start with a globally defined variable, and have two related functions.p  precodelogoutDeterminant  no  function determineword     if word  yes            logoutDeterminant  yes        alertlogoutDeterminant        function showLogoutNotification     if logoutDeterminant  yes         alertlogoutDeterminant        toggle the class      codepre  pThe global variable logout determinant starts with no. When the welcome jsp loads, it runs showLogoutNotification, which means the global variable is assigned no, and the class for the div on the page is not toggled. The div is the successful logout notification, and there is a class that hides it. So the toggle doesnt work, and the hidden class isnt removed.p  pOnce the user enters the main page, and then clicks logout, the function  determineyes runs on click, setting the logoutDeterminant to yes.p  pNow, when the welcome page loads again, I imagined that it wouldve registered logout determinant as yes, and therefore toggled the class. However, it comes out as no. This leads me to believe that the javascript resets when the page changes, and so logout determinant is again no. p  pHow would one go about making the logout notification on the same welcome page I have access to java via jsp servlets, jqueryjavascript, html, and such. p

Negative 6716 pRandom question.p  pI am attempting to create a program which would generate a pseudorandom distribution. I am trying to find the right pseudorandom algorithm for my needs. These are my concernsp  p1 I need one input to generate the same output every time it is used.p  p2 It needs to be random enough that a person who looks at the output from input 1 sees no connection between that and the output from input 2 etc., but there is no need for it to be cryptographically secure or truly random.p  p3Its output should be a number between 0 and 2932001, with every possible integer in that range a possible and equally or close to it likely output.p  p4 I would like to be able to guarantee that every possible permutation of sequences of 410 outputs is also a potential output of consecutive inputs. In other words, all the possible groupings of 410 integers between 0 and 2932001 should be potential outputs of sequential inputs.p  p5 I would like the function to be invertible, so that I could take an integer, or a series of integers, and say which input or series of inputs would produce that result.p  pThe method I have developed so far is to run the input through a simple halson sequence p  precodeboostmultiprecisionmpzint denominator  1 boostmultiprecisionmpzint numerator  0  while inputgt0      denominator 3     numerator  numerator  3  input3     input  input3  codepre  pand multiply the result by 293200. It meets requirements 13, but not 4. And it is invertible only for single integers, not for series since not all sequences can be produced by it. I am working in C, using boost multiprecision.p  pAny advice someone can give me concerning a way to generate a random distribution meeting these requirements, or just a class of algorithms worth researching towards this end, would be greatly appreciated. Thank you in advance for considering my question. p  pUPDATEp  pSince multiple commenters have focused on the size of the numbers in question, I just wanted to make clear that I recognize the practical problems that working with such sets poses but in asking this question Im interested only in the theoretical or conceptual approach to the problem  for example, imagine working with a much smaller set of integers like 0 to 99, and the permutations of sets of 10 of output sequences. How would you design an algorithm to meet these five conditions  1input is deterministic, 2appears random at least to the human eye, 3every integer in the range is a possible output, 4not only all values, but also all permutations of value sequences are possible outputs, 5function is invertible. p  psecond updatep  pwith many thanks to Severin Pappadeux I was able to invert an lcg.

Negative 6716 pstrongQuestionstrong Is there a Fish equivalent of Bashs alias substitution or whats the recommended best practice to keep the code clean and DRYp  pstrongBackgroundstrong Theres a very useful feature of aliases in Bash called alias substitution. Its mentioned briefly in the man pagep  precodealias [p] [name[value] ...]     ...     A trailing space in value causes the next word to be checked for alias substitution when the alias is expanded.     ... codepre  pThe power of this functionality may easily be conveyed with an example. Consider that many users define a grep alias. Heres minep  precode extended regex, skip binaries, devices, sockets, amp dirs, colored, amp line  buffered. use a non canonical alias instead of GREPOPTIONS which may wreck  poorly written scripts alias ggrep EID skip d skip colorauto linebuffered codepre  pSimilarly, many of those same users define an alias for xargs. Heres mine strongwithoutstrong alias substitutionp  precodealias xxargs rdn  n delimited, dont run on empty in codepre  pAnd finally, heres how I might want to use it but it doesnt workp  precode findx g foo xargs g No such file or directory codepre  pThis command fails because x is expanded to xargs and it cant find an executable called codegcode. There are a number of workarounds for this but I think most are awful. However, by just adding a trailing space, the shell will perform alias substitution on our behalf and the command will work as intendedp  precodealias xxargs rdn   n delimited, dont run on empty in,  expansion                      this space is for expanding a subsequent alias codepre  pPlease keep in mind that this is strongjust an examplestrong, not necessarily the actual use case.p  pstrongUpdate 20150506strongp  pI never found a Fishism solution but I felt the alternative was worth a comment. I took the approach of creating shell scripts in codebincode. The downsides arep  ul liThe shell configuration is now multiple files.li liThe interpreter loses inspection of otherwise simple aliases and functions.li ul  pHowever, I felt the upsides were pretty hugep  ul liThe scripts may be written in any language.li liThe scripts are completely independent of the shell choice. Trying new shells is extremely painless. Its been a joy to have a single prompt script that doesnt have to be rewritten or maintained in multiple languages.li ul

Negative 6716 pI am building an app to help keep up with your bar tab while you are out on the town.  I have a feature where the user can set a proximity alarm a Geofence to remind them to close their tab if they leave the bar without closing out.  First the map is shown, then a marker is put at the users location, and then a 100 meter geofence is displayed around the marker.  The users location is updated regularly, so it runs on a background thread.  p  pMy problem is that when the user closes their tab, I want to stop disable the location services that the app is using with a button click.  This button click takes place in a separate Activity from where the map and geolocation service are started.  Any help would be greatly appreciatedp  pPS  I tried to include as much code as possible, so please forgive my clutter.p  pThe map is initiated from the addBtn in this Activityp  precodepublic class

Negative 6716 precodesvg.height codepre  pJust have stumbled upon an interesting bug  which appears in Mozilla when trying to get svg height. While you are trying to set through css SVG container size in percent, jQuery svg.height will return not a pixel value, but a percent value.p  pChrome works fine. Just open this fiddle in Mozilla Firefox and Chrome and compare results a hrefhttpjsfiddle.netLtew9pjb3 relnofollowhttpjsfiddle.netLtew9pjb3ap  pThe answer for now, is simple, if SVG uses displaynone, Mozilla Firefox for some reason will return percent value, and when there is no display none, Mozilla will return px value. I dont know is it really a bug or not, but this how it works now. Check this fiddle a hrefhttpjsfiddle.netLtew9pjb4 relnofollowhttpjsfiddle.netLtew9pjb4ap  pSo I want to ask is it a real Mozilla Firefox or jQuery bug, or something elsep

Negative 6716 pIm using JMeter to perform load tests on a web application mostly html and CSS, nothing fancy. p  pI start with a GET request to the home page. The user clicks on an assignment to go to its description page, so next I have a GET request to the assignment page. There are a few fields and drop downs that need to be filled out, so I inspected each field to get its name ex aid0AssignmentTemplateatsFormemail and created a POST request to submit the form. I got the submit path by going through the process manually and recording post requests with the Chrome extension Live HTTP Headers setting up Test Script Recorder was a pain in the butt so I decided to use this method. In the POST request in JMeter I populated the parameters section with each field name like the example name above and a value like testusertest.com. The user goes through a few pages of forms, so I do a GET request to get the form page and a POST to submit the info, then a GET to go to the next forms page, and so on.p  pI have the View Results Tree Listener on and each request passes without errors, however when I check the database none of the submitted form information is saved.

Negative 6716 pIm trying to have the user enter the date and time when entering a value in a datetime field in TFS before saving it. However, the TFS DateTimeControl only completes the date field first  its only after the user saves the work item where the default 120000 value is added to the time.  The user can manually enter the time to the date upon initially adding a value to the field  for example, the user enters 6302015 8PM and this is accepted. But if the user just uses the calendar button, they only see the date and not a time value.p  pDoes anyone know how to have the time appear when the user selects a date from the calendar  Or some other workaround to have the time required, other than having a default appear after saving the work item.p  pThanksp

Negative 6716 pIm having trouble writing a GENERALLY RECURSIVE function that consumes three nonnegative float numbers xlo, xhi, and threshold that follow the above idea, and produces the integral for f5x510x45x230 between xlo and xhi while solved numerically.p  pIf xlo and xhi are close enough, we can stop and approximate the shape under the curve. A trapezoid is good and simple approximation. One simple definition of close enough is some fixed xdistance threshold, e.g., 0.0001.p  pThe area of a trapezoid is given to be A    h  b1  b2p  pSo far I know that the the function divides the xloxhi range into two ranges xlomid and midxhi then continue recursively on each half... you stop when the current xlixhi for each part is less than the threshold. When the current xlixhi for each part is less than the threshold, then we calculate the area of a trapezoid.p  pIm not quite sure how to write a recursive function for this problem WITHOUT any loops or iteration. p

Negative 6716 pIm of the opinion that user perceived character henceforth UPC iterator would be very useful in a unicode library.  By UPC I mean the sense discussed in a hrefhttpunicode.orgreportstr29 relnofollowunicode standard annex 29a, which is what a user perceives as a character, but might be represented in unicode as a codepoint or a graphemecluster.
