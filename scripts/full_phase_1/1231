Positive 1231 pI am attempting to use LDIFDE to export users, groups, and OUs for importing into a different domain.

However, while importing the group membership associations I got some errors that gave me cause to look closer at what Id created.  To wit  The command above skipped quite a few users in the process of export.  These range from system accounts to actual active users, though the hardest hit was an OU where we keep deactivated accounts.  Not a single strange flag goes up, either.p  pI cant seem to find anything special about these various users that theyd have in common, but Im still looking.  In the mean time, I thought Id check to see if anyone here had any history of LDIFDE simply just blowing past users.p  pThanks,p  pM.p

Negative 1231 pIn many embedded applications there is a tradeoff between making the code very efficient or isolating the code from the specific system configuration to be immune to changing requirements.p  pstrongWhat kinds of C constructs do you usually employ to achieve the best of both worlds flexibility and reconfigurabilty without losing efficiencystrongp  pIf you have the time, please read on to see exactly what I am talking about.p  pWhen I was developing embedded SW for airbag controllers, we had the problem that we had to change some parts of the code every time the customer changed their mind regarding the specific requirements. For example, the combination of conditions and events that would trigger the airbag deployment changed every couple weeks during development. We hated to change that piece of code so often.p  pAt that time, I attended the Embedded Systems Conference and heard a brilliant presentation by Stephen Mellor called Coping with changing requirements. You can read the paper a hrefhttpwww.techonline.comlearningtechpaper197801730 relnofollowherea they make you signup but its free.p  pThe main idea of this was to implement the core behavior in your code but configure the specific details in the form of data. The data is something you can change easily and it can even be programmable in EEPROM or a different section of flash.p  pThis idea sounded great to solve our problem. I shared this with my colleague and we immediately started reworking some of the SW modules.p  pWhen trying to use this idea in our coding, we encountered some difficulty in the actual implementation. Our code constructs got terribly heavy and complex for a constrained embedded system.p  pTo illustrate this I will elaborate on the example I mentioned above. Instead of having a a bunch of ifstatements to decide if the combination of inputs was in a state that required an airbag deployment, we changed to a big table of tables. Some of the conditions were not trivial, so we used a lot of function pointers to be able to call lots of little helper functions which somehow resolved some of the conditions. We had several levels of indirection and everything became hard to understand. To make a long story short, we ended up using a lot of memory, runtime and code complexity. Debugging the thing was not straightforward either. The boss made us change some things back because the modules were getting too heavy and he was maybe right.p  pPS There is a similar question in SO but it looks like the focus is different. a hrefhttpwww.stackoverflow.comquestions466081adaptingtomeetchangingbusinessrequirements983387983387 relnofollowAdapting to meet changing business requirementsap

Negative 1231 pIm developing a java app that exports data to CSV files, intended to be opened in Excel by end users. We just noticed that the export function uses Javas platform default encoding. This causes umlaut characters to be lost and unit test to fail on the build server which is configured to have USASCII as its platform default encoding exactly to catch such potential problems.p  pThe question is which would be the best encoding to use How does Excel determine what encoding to use Does it use something platformspecific that presumably matches Javas platform defaultp  pIm currently leaning towards hardcoding Cp1252  that should cover the target machines the deployment environment is actually specified and would fix the test problem. From googling around, Excel does not seem to handle UTF8 well, so thats out, and sticking to the platform default encoding would require some sort of workaround hack for the tests.p

Negative 1231 pI am writing an application that allows a user to submit a query to multiple systems. I then save each report from each system using SaveToFile, which saves it as an XML document. p  pThe user can then inspect each report by selecting it from a menu, and the report is displayed by loading the report back into an ADO Query component using LoadFromFile and then linking this to a listview.p  pNow, my problem is that the user needs to be able to select any or all of the reports and join them together to create one large report. For examplep  pThe user may define a query to be SELECT  FROM table and he can then run this query on System A, System B and System C. Instead of looking at three separate reports, he needs to have the option to join the reports together from the three systems, so that he can just look at one large report, covering all three systems.p  pIs it possible to do this using the ADO Query components If not, as the file is saved as an XML document, would it be possible to join the reports together using the XML documents instead p  pI have no idea where to start with this so any pointers would be appreciated.p  pEDIT Important information which I somehow managed to forget to include at first p  ol lipThe user needs to be able to access the data offline  i.e. he needs to be able to run the queries over various systems, then work with the reports at a later date. There is therefore a requirement to be able to save the reports to disk and then reload them at a later date, when not connected to any of the systems that the queries were ran on. The user may want to concatenate the reports at this time.pli lipAll reports that are to be joined together will be of exactly the same type  i.e. they will all have been produced from the same query, so will give the same numbertype of fields etc.pli ol

Negative 1231 pI have written a custom class that depends significantly on touch draggingpositioning, outside of its own view boundaries.

An example of something that would use this protocol would be a view that allows things to be dropped into it from my custom class.p  pThe problem I have is in figuring out when a touch is ended the object is dropped, whether or not there is an object that cares below that position. For cares, read conforms to the protocol.p  pIf its a view that conforms to my protocol, its easy, I can find it with code CALayer hitTestCGPointthePointcode or something along those lines and query with a codeconformsToProtocolprotocolxxcode.p  pBut if it is a view which is a subview of a UIViewController for example, the iviewi does not conform to the protocol, even though the UIViewController as its delegate does.

Negative 1231 pIm using javamail to send mails from my appengine application. It works perfectly in the deployment, but I cant figure out how to do this using the development server. Whenever I need to test the sendmail, Im having to deploy the application which is quite annoying.p  pstrongBackground Information Why logs dont workstrongp  pWe know emails go to the logs on the appengine development server. However, the primary reason for wanting to send emails from the development server is to be able to test the format of the email. How does it look Do changes need to be made to the email template so it looks good in email clients A, B, and C, and can it be done quickly without the hassle of deploying to a real, default appengine version each and every time.p  pWere not spammers. Were not trying to circumvent any type of security. In short, we want to legitimately be able to see the real, actual email in one or more email clients and then make code changes instantly so we can tweak them without having to go through the painstaking process of the edit, compile, wait 5 minutes for it to deploy, test, repeat cycle. Since there are no standards in how each email client renders an email, this painstaking process is amplified by trying to get something to work in many clients.p  pstrongQuestionstrongp  pstrongHow can the Java Google App Engine Development server be configured to send emails from the local computer or an SMTP service for the purpose of testing emails sent to real, actual email clientsstrongp

Negative 1231 pIve a partially finished interpreter for a lexically scoped pure Lisp no codesetcode that uses a callbyneed evaluation model which comes down to callbyname with simple caching, the interpreter naturally uses an environmentbased evaluation model.p  pThe standard way of evaluating lambda abstractions, as in, constructing a new environment from the formal paramatres and the environment in which the abstraction is evaluated and simply placing the evaluations of the arguments in their own environment in it. Then evaluate the body of the abstraction in the new environment wouldnt work because it would mean a callbyvalue semantics.p  pMy solution to this problem was replacing where required the idea of environments with lookup functions, which just take a symbol as argument, and produce an associated datum. Which can easily be made from an environment. Lambdaapplications are just done by evaluating the body again with a lookup function which is made from both the environment in which the definition lies, and in which the argument lie. Which evaluates them lazily and only when required.p  pWhat I wonder though is what the overhead from this model is, how expensive is it to generate these lookups for every application, the code for these lookups is pretty large. I know that lambda application and creation in Scheme is fairly cheap and many sources advocate using them extensively to maintain the readability of code even though in a lot of cases they would have a slight overhead. But as lambdaapplications are ubiquitous in any lisp, I wonder just how much performance could be saved from using a potentially different model. I tried searching this on google but all the models for callbyneed interpreters I found were even more awkward, but often so to accommodate for codesetcode.p  pSome relevant pieces of my codep  pThe evaluator that uses the lookup functionp  precode evaluates a datum using a lookup  lookup is a function which takes a symbol as an argument and produces the value  some sorts of more powerful environment  if lookup is a standard environment, treats it as such define evaldatum d lookup   cond      quoted d dequote d  if quoted, just dequote     hastype d symboltype  symbols ...       if procedure lookup  checks if its an environment or a lookup function          lookup d          lookupsymbol d lookup     hastype d pairtype evalpair d lookup  function application     else d  rest is considered selfevaluating codepre  pAnd the function that generates the more advanced lookups. This especially is what worries me, though its tailrecursive and uses very cheap codeeqcode and codenullcode comparisons, it doesnt look as efficient as simply using codeassqcode on an environment list, and some times even the lack of random access on those worries me a bit.p  precode extends a lookup for use in a lambda abstraction  the inner environment is where the lambda is defined  the outer environment where it is applied  params can be either a pair or a symbol  params automatically tries to match the arguments pattern define extendlookup params args innerenv outerenv   lambda s     let checkparams params params args args       cond         eq s params datum args  for an improper list or a single symbol, simply turn the arglist into an evaluable list         null params lookupsymbol s innerenv  if the number of paramatres are exhausted, simply use the innerenv         eq s car params  in case of a formal parametre match ...               refeval args 0 outerenv  evaluate the needed argument and return it         else checkparams cdr params cdr args  repeat for the next paramatre codepre  pIt should be apparent that the evaluator works by a simple termreduction system that when evaluating expressions in a list simply replaces them with their result, quoting them whenever the result is not considered selfevaluating. Which is possible because its a purely functional lisp. It also captures caching and most of the garbage collection in one go.p  pI should add that one of the things I always had very poor conception of is overhead and complexity theory. For those that say If you want performance, why are you making your interpreter in Lisp, its only a test of the general structure to see if it works, Ill be rewriting it in C soon enough.p  pAh, I couldnt even submit this at first because the tag callbyneed doesnt already exist, promising start.p

Negative 1231 pI use ReportViewer web server control on a web page. The goal is to have a page that will allow anonymous access. Im creating a dummy FormsAuthentication cookie that expires in 5 seconds and try to call the report. I also derive from IReportServerCredential and pass in Domain administrators credentials to the report server. Weird thing is that this approach works fine if i run the web site on VS 2008 and access it from Firefox or IE. I get reports to display. I am also able to host the web site on my Dev box in IIS and view the report in both FF and IE. But as soon as i deploy the web site to production box, I can no longer view reports on IE, but still can on FF. Reports are shown both in IE and FF if a user logs in and opens the page afterward. Web Server and Report Server are two different machines on the same network, same domain. IIS on the production box has impersonation enablet to impersonate domain admin. IIS on both, Dev and Prod boxes has correct http handler mapped for report cpontrol .axd Any thoughts and suggestions are welcome. Thanksp

Negative 1231 pI have an Access 2003 project in which all data is stored in SQL Server 2008. I am using ADO to viewupdate data via forms that are completely unbound. For example, a form has several textboxes and combo boxes on it. When the form is loaded I use ADO to make a call to a stored procedure on SQL SQL, it returns a recordset and I populate the controls, via VBA, with the data from the recordset. I like this approach because only the VBA is stored within Access. No data well actually connection strings are stored in Access, but that is it.p  pMy problem is what to do when it comes to reports. I want to create reports that are based off of views created within SQL Server, however I would like to avoid, if possible, static linking to the views directly from within Access. Is it possible to set the recordsource of a report dynamically at runtime to be the results of a SQL Server view If it is, how does one go about designing the report id Access does not contain any datap  pMore info ... The reason I want to avoid linking to the view in Access is the environment in which the Access application could be run changes Production, Development, Test. Currently whenever I make any calls to the database stored procedures, I look up the connection string Active Directory based so no passwords are stored in the only table that is stored in Access .p  pThanks for any assistance.p

Negative 1231 pIm trying to incorporate serverbased code diff and highlighting in my GWT Java project. I managed to incorporate Pygments and difflib a hrefhttpdev.bostone.us20101201pythonpygmentsinjavawithjythonawp3a20101201pythonpygmentsinjavawithjython relnofollowinto my code using Jythona. The basic idea is to generate complete markup on the server and then simply inject code into the page as codeinnerHTMLcode.  I found Jython completely inadequate as even for relatively small files 2K3K lines it takes Pygments or difflib forever minutes not seconds to process these files. Difflib actually reliably causes OOM errors in the process with dedicated 500M of memory So Im wondering if a hrefhttpdev.bostone.us20101201pythonpygmentsinjavawithjythonawp3a20101201pythonpygmentsinjavawithjython relnofollowmy current setupa is wrong or Jython is simply unsuitable for this purpose p  pIf so, whats next I discover a hrefhttpjepp.sourceforge.net relnofollowJeppa but then I would have to build my project for each platform and it has little documentation and dont seem very stable.

Im trying to figure out an effective way to manage the levels as right now I am using a separate function to output the children blocks, and if I wanted to be able to go 3 levels deep, I would have to create yet another function.

Negative 1231 pIm working on a J2ME application that should be ported to different vendors phones. So far, the application is working fine, except on the Motorola V3 this is the only Motorola phone I have tried.p  pThe problem is that when I start a new Thread, and when the thread tries to update the graphics by calling repaint, the graphic system is stack.p  pSome useful info  Im obtaining the display in the constructor of the Midlet, and reusing it during the application lifespan.  There is only one class extending Canvas. Every drawing happens here. When I want the graphics repainted, I call the repaint method, either from the UI thread or from another Worker thread. As far as I know, every thread can access the UI without problems.  I tried a fix where, in the beginning of the app, I take the name of the running UI thread and store it for later use. Before repaint is called, I check if the current threads name equals to the UI threads name. If it odes, then I do coderepaintcode, else I dop  precodedisplay.callSeriallynew Runnable      public void run          repaint       codepre  pCan you point to me any specifics in the Motorolas implemenation of J2ME How can I solve this problem with threads updating the UIp  pThanks, Zlatkop

Negative 1231 pI have a JSP page containing a codehdataTablecode. The datatable has a column of codehcommandLinkcode components which open a new popup window. These commandLink components have an codeactionListenercode method in the pages backing bean. The code determines which commandLink component was clicked, grabs its parameter and redirects to a servlet.

Negative 1231 pIn Java 1.6.021, the first example below compiles fine, and I think thats because the parameter type bounds are bare.  That is, in the Z extends Zen bound below, Java allows  Zen to slide by as the name of a raw, nongeneric type equivalent to the runtime erased type.  This might be wrong and bad, but it also can be useful, or at least wacky  good times on the bus ride homep  precodepublic class CorefTest       public static interface TaoltZ extends Zengt            public static interface ZenltT extends Taogt        codepre  pIn Scala 2.8.0.final, the below compiles great up through CleanOceanWithFish, showing  some basic type param hookups.

I think that getting Zen and Tao  compiling in Scala will probably show the way to that Java extension.  If you can consider the Java extension issue in your answer, so much the better.   Thanks for any helpp  pstrongUpdatestrong posted after the very helpful first two answers below from Nikita S. and Kris N.p  pI empirically learned some more about various JavaScala coreference scenarios.

The key step in both the Java and the Scala is placing the bounded wildcard at the point where the type parameter tree loops back into the current declaration type, i.e. the  extends in java, and the  lt in Scala.   p

Unfortunately I can never get my crash to occur unless I use the actual device, in which case it happens every few minutes.p  pWhen using MallocStackLogging I get a file written to my local IPad in privatevarmobileApplications.... but there doesnt seem to be any way to transfer that .link file to my local machine since the device isnt jailbroken and even if I could there seems to be no way to use it on my local machine with mallochistory.p  pThe best I could do was get it to crash when running InstrumentsAllocations, but when I looked at the region it pointed to 50 allocations from many different functions, but all were already deallocated and no longer live. And all of them were internal allocations, in ImageIO startpasshuffdecoder, etc.p  pIm working with a fairly complex, large base of code, so code inspection of the entire project is not feasible.p  pI really need some way to get the debugger to break as soon as the checksum is violated, rather than later when it just happens to be doing an unrelated malloc, which doesnt offer any useful information. Setting a breakpoint at codemallocerrorbreakcode seems to have no effect.p  pIts clear that I have an invalid pointer somewhere writing to memory it shouldnt be, but Im stuck as to how to narrow down which piece of code is causing it.p  pAny advice or suggestions would be very helpfulp  pThanks in advance.p

Negative 1231 pIve spent a while reading and experimenting here, and come up with a few approaches, but not got any of them to work completely yet, so I would like to know what more experienced Swing programmers would do.p  pThe main window of my application contains a custom subtype of JPanel, which is used to display an image calculated from a mathematical function. This can take some time to calculate, so while this happens I display a text message and a progress bar superimposed on the middle of the panel. I would like both the text and the progress bar to resize appropriately when the panel is resized, probably using a constant fraction of the width of the panel.p  pAt the moment I have another JPanel subtype that contains the text and the progress bar, and I add this progress panel to the main panel, and set it to be visible when required. The main panel does not contain any other components, but has its own paintComponent method to display a BufferedImage obtained from another class. There are a few problems with this as it standsp  ul liThe progress panel is not always visible when it should be, perhaps because there is nowhere in the code that explicitly ensures it is painted in front of the image.li liThe progress panel always takes up the full width of the application panel. It is centred vertically using a BoxLayout in the main panel with some vertical glue before and after the progress panel, but I havent managed to get the same trick to work horizontally, and in any case the preferred horizontal size of the progress panel is not necessarily right. One approach that almost works is to use a BorderLayout with horizontal and vertical struts around the progress panel, but the size of the progress panel is still not right, and the struts need to be changed when the main panel is resized.li ul  pSo what would you dop  ul liUse a different layout manager in the main panelli liUse a LayeredPane or OverlayLayout somehowli liAdd a further layer to the containment hierarchy containing the image panel and the progress panelli liSome combination of the above, or something elseli ul  pWhat about resizing the text. Do I need to explicitly create a new Font when the panel is resized, or is there any way to do this more automatically   p

Negative 1231 pIs there an extensible, efficient way to write existential statements in Haskell without implementing an embedded logic programming language Oftentimes when Im implementing algorithms, I want to express existentially quantified firstorder statements likep  precodex.y.x,y  xs  x  y  p x y codepre  pwhere codecode is overloaded on lists. If Im in a hurry, I might write perspicuous code that looks likep  precodefind p []      False find p xxs  any y gt x  y ampamp p x y  p y x xs  find p xs codepre  porp  precodefind p xs  or [ x  y ampamp p x y  p y x  x lt xs, y lt xs] codepre  pBut this approach doesnt generalize well to queries returning values or predicates or functions of multiple arities. For instance, even a simple statement likep  precodex.y.x,y,z  xs  x  y  z  f x y z  g x y z codepre  prequires writing another search procedure. And this means a considerable amount of boilerplate code. Of course, languages like codeCurrycode or codePrologcode that implement narrowing or a resolution engine allow the programmer to write statements likep  precodefindp,xs,z  x  xs amp y  xs amp x  y amp f x y  g x y  z codepre  pto abuse the notation considerably, which performs both a search and returns a value. This problem arises often when implementing formally specified algorithms, and is often solved by combinations of functions like codefmapcode, codefoldrcode, and codemapAccumcode, but mostly explicit recursion. Is there a more general and efficient, or just general and expressive, way to write code like this in Haskellp

Negative 1231 pIm adding some mobile usability optimisations to our site. As part of this I am tweaking the type attribute of textfields, to give the user the best input tools for the expected data type.p  pOne issue I have come up against in touchscreen mobile devices is that browsers on different OSes, and even different browsers on the same OS, show different onscreen keyboards when input typenumber is used.p  pSafari on iOS 4.3.3 iPhone 4 and Chrome on Android 2.3.4 include a decimal point, but Firefox on Android 2.3.4 does not.p  pI have tried adding the step attribute step0.1 with no improvement in Firefox. p  pIf I cannot show the decimal point I will need to show Firefox the full QWERTY keyboard, which is obviously not going to make for the best user experience. It also raises the issue of browserdevice sniffing. Either Ill need to make QWERTY the default, and show the numberpad to the handful of devices I can actually test on, or make numberpad the default, and switch back to QWERTY on devices which I know this will break on, the latter option being far less robust as I cannot test on every device ever made.p  pTesting for support for input typenumber is not a fix, as obviously the browser does support the element, it just doesnt offer enough keyboard options to enter all number types.p  pSo.. I was wondering if anyone knew of a way to test for the presence of a certain key such as the decimal point in the keyboard the browserOS assigns to the input type, andor if anyone else has some better suggestions, as Im quite new to mobile devices.p  pI should also mention that I am using JavaScript here, as this is a website, not a native App.p  pThanks p
Negative 1231 pAs you can see in the runnable code below, i try to have a Box with expandable childboxes. The children Boxes can change they size and this all works good.

At the moment they shrink the other childrenboxes only.p  pI tried Glue and Filler, but it didnt work.

Negative 1231 pIm searching for the best practice to convert Float to Double without loosing precision. So far I only found that a proper way to do so is to convert the Float to String and the String to Double. p  pSearching the Float API I stumbled upon this method doubleValue.

Negative 1231 pWhen building a RESTful web service using Spring MVC, I feel Ive encountered a tricky situation when trying to combine Jackson JSON deserialization and JSR303 bean validation.p  pOne of the neat things about JSR303 validation is that one can return all validation errors associated with a target object rather than just fail on the first constraint violation though there is a fail fast mode if you want to use it. p  pImagine a scenario where you have a JSON payload such asp  precode    firstname Joe,    surname Bloggs,    age 25  codepre  pAnd then you have the object you wish to map top  precodepublic class Person      NotNull    private String firstname     NotNull    private String surname     Minvalue  0    private int age     ...  codepre  pMy issue with this setup is that if the client sends a String as the value for age, the whole Jackson deserialization process will fail without being able to specifically target the reason why it failed i.e. well never get as far as validating. Imagine, then, this payloadp  precode    age invalid  codepre  pIn this case, what Id like to return would be an errors response such asp  precode     errors  [       error           field firstname,          message Must not be null,       ,       error           field surname,          message Must not be null,       ,       error           field age,          message Must be numeric value greater than or equal 0,           ]  codepre  pThe simple way around this problem would be to simply specify the age field as type String and then convert the value when passing it on to, say, the persistence layer. However, I dont really like the idea of resorting to data transfer objects that use Strings in a blanket fashion  it just seems wrong to do that in terms of preserving a clean design.p  pAnother option I thought of would be to create a class such asp  precodepublic abstract class BindableValueltTgt      private String stringValue     private T value     public T getValue        ifvalue  null           value  fromStringstringValue              return value         protected abstract T fromStringString stringValue  codepre  pI could then create implementations such as IntegerValue, LongValue, DateTimeValue etc. of course also writing custom type adapters for Jackson. And then my Person class could bep  precodepublic class Person      NotNull    private StringValue firstname     NotNull    private StringValue surname     Minvalue  0    private IntegerValue age     ...  codepre  pThis is almost what I want but, unfortunately, the JSR303 annotations such as NotNull and Min are not going to recognise my BindableValue implementations.p  pSo, can anyone explain a way I could solve this problem in a cleaner wayp

Negative 1231 pI have set the launch image for my app to look like the initial screen. My app is a multiscreenmultiview application that mostly takes place in a UINavigationController. But every screen can look very different, so there isnt really much commonality for a general launch image. p  pI have noticed that if I am in a screen in the app, then go out of the app pressing the home button, then go back in, it shows the launch image, then it loads up the screen the user was last using. I think this is the expected behavior. p  pThat being said, according to Apple, the launch image is required. So it seems that I have a few optionsp  ol liSet an all black launch imageli liCache an image of the last screen and somehow set that as a dynamic launch imageli liSpecify to only use a launch image on the first screenli liDont specify launch imageli ol  pRight now I am leaning towards option 1 and just having an allblack launch image, but I would appreciate if anyone has any tipssuggestionsadvice.

Negative 1231 pIve been writing ActionScript for nigh on 10 years but Ive always used separate text editors like TextMate to write the code and used the Flash IDE to compile it. I decided that this weekend Id give Flash Builder a try, since its clearly the way forward.p  pAnyway. Im using Flash Builder 4.6 on OSX  installed this morning and I havent futzed with it  and I built a simple Actionscript Mobile App because my current project at work is a mobile air app, being built with the Flash IDE. p  precodepackage      import zakariya.layout.RootLayoutSprite      public class DoesThisEvenWork extends RootLayoutSprite              public function DoesThisEvenWork                      super              trace hello... whats my size   this.size                     override public function onLayoutUpdatedvoid              super.onLayoutUpdated            override public function onSizeChangedvoid              super.onSizeChanged         trace onSizeChanged..., new size   this.size           codepre  pThe class RootLayoutSprite derives from LayoutSprite and is part of a layout management API I wrote and have used in dozens of projects, big and small. The onLayoutUpdated and onSizeChanged methods are defined in LayoutSprite, as well as the size property.p  pThe definition looks more or less like sop  precodepackage zakariya.layout       public class LayoutSprite extends Sprite                        Called after this Sprites size changes, before layout of children is executed                  public function onSizeChangedvoid                                Called after this Sprites size changes, after layout of children is executed                  public function onLayoutUpdatedvoid                  codepre  pThe zakariya.layout code is raw code in a local repo  not compiled to SWC  and its all in a folder structure which I added to the projects source path. Flash builder clearly recognizes the base classes because it recognizes RootLayoutSprite.p  pWhen I try to build this I get the followingp  precode1006 A super expression can be used only inside class instance methods.

Ive avoided Flash Builder for years because I didnt write Flex projects... and in my free time I write C so I dont know anything about the Flash Builder eclipse toolchain.p  pstrongMy assumption is that the Flash IDE has a less strict compiler than Flash Builder, and as such, Ive been doing something wrong for so long I didnt know it was wrong.strong p  pHelpp

Negative 1231 pstrongThe tldr versionstrong p  pIs there an easy way for an aspx page to push a message to a Windows service wout the service constantly polling a shared resource e.g. database tablep  pstrongThe tlbutIreaditanyway versionstrongp  pIve got an ASP.NET web app that implements a very long running process.  I understand that a common way to sidestep issues due to app pool recycling and requests timing out for example is to create a Windows service to handle the longrunning process outside of IIS.p  pIm comfortable w ASP.NET and Ive built simple windows services before, but I could use some advice on how best to pass messages between the web page and the windows service.p  pThe obvious easy solution is to use a shared database  the web page writes a request to a jobs table and the service monitors that table to know when to process the job.  However, Im not sure thats a good fit for the way my app is used.p  pThe app is basically a hoppedup email newsletter mailer with some caveats that make it slower than your typical SMTP mail merge.  It gets used once every few days, on average, and a typical use case is to send several short email jobs and then one or two long ones.  So the send email code, which is what I want to move the windows service, can take anywhere from a few seconds up to 20 minutes and growing to execute.p  pSo it seems that for the web app to be responsive at the short end of the scale, the service would have to poll the database every couple of seconds so that users arent waiting longer for the job to start than it would take to execute.  But that seems like a lot of useless load on the database for the days at a time when the app isnt used at all.p  pIve seen examples that use System.Diagnostics.Process to let an aspx page run a console application, which seems closer to how my app is actually used if I were to put the mail code in the console app, but I dont think that gets it out from under the IIS process.p  pSo my question boils down to is there an easy way for a web page to push a message to or otherwise provoke a reaction from the windows service wout the windows service constantly polling a shared resource e.g. database table  Or is that constant db polling less of an issue than I think it isp  pFurther details the web app targets the 3.5 framework and is running on an old backwater IIS 6 box.  In my research, Ive run across info on MSMQ, a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibraryms734677.aspx relnofollowWCFWASa, even a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibrarykwdt6w2k28vvs.10029.aspx relnofollow.NET Remotinga, but they all feel like overkill and my time budget for this problem leaves me enough time to learn emsomethingem new, but not enough to parse and compare all three or spend too much more time down the google rabbit hole.p  pIm really just looking for a simple lightweight way to move some code out from under the IIS process.p

Negative 1231 pI have a container with a video element and a navigation menu.  The nav is hidden until the video finishes playing, at which point the video is hidden and the navigation becomes visible.  This works perfectly on the desktop.  However, on the iPad, the video does not get to finish playing before the ended event apparently finishes.p  pAlso, because you cant autoplay a video element in iOS, I also catch the play event to hide the controls after the video has started. I left this in, just in case someone knows an issue it causes.  It still happens with that bit removed though.p  pIs there a work around for this behavior  I could not find anything about this issue. It seems to me that the video plays with some lag, and the ended event fires after the calculated duration, regardless of how long it actually takes to complete, although this is just speculation.

Negative 1231 pI am looking for a way to strongpopulatestrong some strongfieldsstrong in an entityform for example name and email once a client has filled in his taxnumber or another configurable field. The field to compare it to is in another node or entity.p  pstrongFor examplestrongp  blockquote   pA registration form for an event  when a user is registrating check   if the filled in tax number allready exists in one of the nodes   attendees last year. If it finds a match, it takes the date in the   name field of the node, and puts it in the name field in the form   in the next step, see underneathp blockquote  pFor the forms I am using the EntityFormsmodule which creates a form with the fields of an entity, so users can create new entity objects and a custom module which allows me to go through the form in multiple steps, a rules event is triggered when the continue button in a formstep is clicked.p  pI have rules and rulesformssupport enabled, I try to make a rulep  ul liEvent my custom continue button is clicked li liCondition entered date    from a to be selected field from the form allready exists in a to    be selected nodes fieldli liaction the to be selected field from the    node is put in the to be selected field on the formli ul  pI cant hardcode this because it has to be configurable have to make multiple different forms..p
Negative 1231 pI am converting a flash site to js and there is alot going onp  pConstantly running dynamic background, running on jquery. Site calls hundreds of images via ajax API. Mouse over images, calls more ajax to grab bigger version and display that as an overlay, with a nice animation sequence. Lots of mouse positioning calls for figuring out if the mouse is still over an image covered by an overlay.p  pBut some animations are getting jumpy even with easing.  Is this the point to stop with jsp

Negative 1231 pI am just getting started with JNDI for the first time.  I am developing a web application using Spring Mvc deployed on tomcat, connecting to a Mysql database.p  pFrom my understanding, the reasoning to use a JNDI datasource is wanting to connect to a different database when running the application locally and on the live server, but not wanting to have to change any configuration in order to do this I retrieve the datasource from JNDI, which gives me a different datasource on different machines.p  pMy question is I am unsure as to what JNDI context I should be using for my java objects  The extent of examples I find online tend to say retrieve from JNDI without saying what the JNDI context is.p  pTo elaborate, should I be using LDAP for example  Or should I be using tomcat  If I am using tomcat, what is the point in a local JDNI object as opposed to a global one  Ie, surely the local one means I have to change configuration setting when I want the JNDI objects to be different hence why did I bother configuring my datasource in JNDI in the first place  Intuitively, I would imagine a global tomcat JNDI context would be the best option, but I am just a little sketchy.p

Negative 1231 pI like to pop out results in a window so that theyre easier to see and find e.g., they dont get lost as the console continues to scroll.  One way to do this is to use codesinkcode and codefile.showcode.  For example  p  precodey lt rnorm100 x lt rnorm100 mod lt lmyx sinktempSink, typeoutput summarymod sink file.showtempSink, delete.fileT, titleModel summary codepre  pI commonly do this to examine model fits, as above, but also for a wide variety of other functions and objects, such as codesummarydata.framecode, codeanovamodel1, model2code, codetablefactor1, factor2code.

The point here is that both the nature of the function and the object can vary.  p  pIt is somewhat tedious to type out all of the above every time.

First, how would you do this so that it wont crash with the wrong type of object or function without having to have a list of conditional executions i.e., codeifis.listobj  lapply...code.  Second, Im not sure how to handle the codemargincode argument.  Lastly, this doesnt work even when I try simple, contrived examples where I know that everything is set appropriately, so there seems to be something fundamentally wrong.  p  pDoes anyone know how such a situation can be handled simply and easily  Im not new to R, but Ive never been formally taught it Ive picked up tricks in an adhoc manner, i.e., Im not a very sophisticated R programmer.

Negative 1231 pI need the opinionadvice of more experienced network programmers about some stuff regarding to packets injection on GNULinux systems. Im working on a open source C library for packet injection and sniffing. The library is a hrefhttpcode.google.complibcrafter relnofollowlibcraftera. On the page there are a few examples to see how the library works.p  pI have a dilemma, and would appreciate your thoughts. Currently, the library offer two ways to write a packet on the wire. First, the packet is constructedp  precodePacket pck  IPUDPDNS codepre  p1 and then is sent with the Send functionp  precodepck.Sendeth0 codepre  p2 OR using the RawSocketSend function which is an experimental function that Im using for benchmarking but is available for the userp  precodepck.RawSocketSendsd codepre  pwhere sd is a socket descriptor. If the packet has a link layer protocol like Ethernet sd should be a PACKET socket descriptor. If not, should be a RAW socket descriptor.p  pThe standard and documented way to send a packet is with the Send method. Currently, the Send method uses a hrefhttpsourceforge.netprojectslibnetdev relnofollowlibneta for write the packet on the wire.p  pThe thing is that the Send function is by far more slow than the RawSocketSend... I constantly have to do a lot of tricky and annoying stuff to adapt the way that libcrafter handle the protocols fields to properly use the libnetbuild functions which results on a performance penalty. And each time I implement a protocol I have to take a look to libnet documentation and makes the development processes very tedious and slow. So, I was thinking to stop using libnet for packet injection and directly use RAWPACKET sockets inside the Send function.p  pLibcrafter is designed to handle all the tedious work of packet crafting checksum calculations, byte ordering, header lengths, etc. in a transparent way for the user. And everything works fine on the most popular GNULinux systems Ubuntu, Fedora, Debian using RAWPACKET sockets the RawSocketSend function.p  pThe only reason why I use libnet is for portability issues. But I dont have the knowledge or intentions to port libcrafter to other system rather than GNULinux systems.p  pMy questions are p  ol liIs prudent and safe to use RAWPACKET sockets on a packet injection library for GNULinux li liIf I decide to stop using libnet, do you know some issues that I should take into account regarding to portability with RAWPACKET sockets between GNULinux distrosli liThe RAWPACKET sockets interface may change in future versions of the kernelli ol  pThank you very much p

Negative 1231 pOn math.SE, a a hrefhttpmath.stackexchange.comq1549033733question about math notationa enerated a discussion of how programming languages interpret the set 1,...,n when n0p  pThe question asked for a mathematical notation to represent the R code code1ncodep  pAccording to the comments, the mathematical interpretation of 1,...,n when n0 is that this is an empty set. A subsequent comment suggested that C is consistent with this interpretation, because codefor int i  1 i lt n icode returns a empty set because it iterates 0 times. p  pIt is not clear to me what the equivalent statement in R is, but code10code returns the vector code[1,0]code p  pThus, codefor i in 10 printicode iterates over 1 and 0 I interpret as analogous to the C code abovep  pIs this because 1,...,n is not the correct notation for code1ncodep  pDoes this mean R violates a universal rulep  pIs there a consistent interpretation for this set among programming languagesp

Negative 1231 pI had to convert some code which deals with building a VBO of data for the outlines of 2D shapes, i.e. they are not just triangle meshes, they can be an arbitrary length polygon outline from using primitive restart to using codeglMultiDrawElementscode. I now realize codeglMultiDrawArrayscode is actually more appropriate for my application but that is not relevant to the question indeed I would not have encountered this curious problem if I had been smarter and ported it to use codeglMultiDrawArrayscode instead.p  pI assembled two vectors to store the data for storing the requisite values p  precodestruct EMDEGBuffer      stdvectorltGLvoidgt indices     stdvectorltGLsizeigt lengths  codepre  pThen what I did was for each polygon with N vertices push a single value to both codeindicescode and codelengthscode, in codeindicescode I inserted codecharNULLindexcode where codeindexcode is the index in the IBO which corresponds to the first vertex of the polygon, and in codelengthscode I place the integer number of vertices in that polygon. p  pThe codeEMDEGBuffercode struct is used to pass values to codeglMultiDrawElementscode like so p  precodeglMultiDrawElementsGLTRIANGLEFAN, mde.lengths.data, GLUNSIGNEDINT, const GLvoidmde.indices.data, mde.indices.size  codepre  pI test my program and the render is completely screwed up. p  pEventually I fiddle around a bit with some hardcoded values passed into codeglMultiDrawElementscode and I discover that my indices values were off by a factor of 4. p  pConsider as an example the first polygon has 3 vertices and the second polygon has 5 vertices.p  pTo get correct results my codeindicescode vector contains code[0,0xc]code and codelengthscode contains code[3,5]code.p  pWhy should codeindicescode not be code[0,0x3]codep

I have also created an index on the column I am searching for in the WHERE clause.p  pThe thing I want to insert into the table may or may not already exist in the table so it may be an update or an insert. So first I define a Boolean variable like alreadyexists and a select statement that goes and searches for the value in the table, if it finds it it will set the Boolean variable to true, else it will remain false. Then I say oh OK if that variable is true, then run this update command on the table, if it is false run this insert command.p  pSo is it the right way of doing it or there are better waysp

Negative 1231 pI am thinking about a method to handle the data more efficiently. Let me explain itp  pCurrently, there is a class, called codeRulescode, it has a lot of member functions, like codeRulesisForwardEligiblecode, codeRulesisCurrentNumberEligiblecode....So these functions are used to check the specific situations when other process call them, all of them return bool value.p  pIn the body of these functions are codeifcodes which will query the DB to compare data, finally return turn or false.p  pSo the whole thing is like codeifRulesisCurrentNumberEligiblecodeCheck content in codeRulesisCurrentNumberEligiblecodecodeifxxxxcodexxxx will be another function again, query DB, I think this kind way is not good. I want to improve it.p  pWhat I am imagining, is to use less code but query more for the information.p  pSo I can query in the first step codeifRulesisCurrentNumberEligiblecode, I can set different tables for query, so the things like codeifxxxifxxifxx....code will be less. A solutions is to build a class whose role is like a coordinator, ask him each time for different querys. Is it suitable p  pI am not sure it is a good way to control this, or may be there are some good solutions aside. Please help me, thanksp

Most of what I am about to talk about is based on the help provided at a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions2983250customeventlisteneronandroidappCustom event listener on Android appap  pSo here is my issue.  I am writing an app that needs to download updated images from the web, store the images on the phone, then later display those images.  Basically, I download any needed images during a splash screen.  Then when the images are downloaded and stored, the splash screen clears and any necessary newly downloaded images are displayed on the screen.  Here is the problem the download process is done via an asynctask so the part where the images are loaded on to the screen cant be done inside the asynctask.  It has to be done on the main UI thread.  I would like to create an event and a custom event listener for the main thread to listen for that basically tells the main UI thread that it is safe to start loading the downloaded images from memory.p  pAccording to the discussion from the link above, I came up with this so far... a download listener interacep  precodepublic interface DataDownloadListener   void onDownloadStarted  void onDownloadFinished  codepre  pan event class...p  precode public class DataDownloadEvent        ArrayListltDataDownloadListenergt listeners  new ArrayListltDataDownloadListenergt       public void setOnDownloadDataDownloadListener listener            this.listeners.addlistener          codepre  pMy problem is that I dont understand where to put the last two steps in those instructions.

Does that mean in the onCreate method of my main activity outside the class in the import section of the main activity  Never done a custom event before, so any help would be appreciated.p

Negative 1231 pI am rather interested in using a skip list for a Open list for A.  However what bugs me is the probabilistic nature of it.  Open lists can vary from very small sets on up to hugh numbers of nodes and needs to maintain performance for each.p  pAs I understand Skip lists have a higher chance of Randomly giving bad results for small data sets.  I think this might become problematic with large numbers of short Paths being generated.p  pI was thinking to fix this why not watchdog the random numbers to a degree.  Keep a running total of the number of nodes of each level and in order to maintain the ideal distribution of nodes between each level sometimes intervene and force a node to be a specific level.p  pI am unsure just how well this would work in my given application and if maybe i should focus on another data structure for my open lists instead.p  pAll the articles i have read on skip lists have made no mention of such an optimization. Since I am fairly new to the whole performance profiling game, I am hesitant to try and improve on a documented data structure.p

And the root is 235 has 2 childs 123 and 999 When I delete the amp at the codeKnightTreeamptreecode in insert function it still doesnt work. I think the key is how to work with pointers.

Negative 1231 h1Question, topic of discussionh1  pI am very interested in generation of command line shell scripting source code from source code written in a more robustnesspromoting, wellperformant and platformindependent compiled language OCaml, for instance. Basically, you would program in compiled language to perform any interactions with the OS that you want I would propose the more complex interactions or ones that are not easy to do in a platformindependent way, you would compile it to a native binary executable preferably, which would generate a shell script that effects in the shell what you programmed in the compiled language. [strongADDEDstrong] With effects, I mean to set the environment variables and shell options, execute certain nonstandard commands the standard scripting glue would be handled by the compiled executable and would be kept out of the generated shell script and such.p  pI have not found any such solution so far. It seems to be relatively easy to realize compared to other possibilities of today, like compiling OCaml to JavaScript.p  ul liAre there already public implementations of what I describeli liWhat are other possibilities that are emveryem similar to what I describe, and in what ways do they differ from that Languagetolanguage compilation from compiled to sh comes to mind, although that seems unnecessarily hard to realize.li ul  pstrongWhat I do emnotem meanstrongp  ol liAn alternative shell like Scsh. The systems you administer may not always allow shells to be chosen by the user or by one administrator, and I also hope it to be a system administration solution exclusively for others customers, colleagues and others as well, people who cannot be expected to accept a different shell.li liAn alternative interpreter, for the purpose that noninteractive shell scripts normally serve like ocamlscript. Personally, I do not have a problem in avoiding shell scripting for this purpose. I do so because shell scripts are generally harder to maintain for example, sensitive to certain characters and manipulation of mutable things like commands and harded to craft to the same level of functionality that popular generalpurpose programming languages could offer for example, compare Bash to Python in this regard. emHowever, there are cases where a native shell script is needed, for instance a shell profile file that is sourced by a shell when it is launched.emli ol  h1Backgroundh1  pstrongPractical applicationsstrongp  pSome of you may doubt the practical usefulness of what I describe. One practical application of this is to define a shell profile based on various conditions for example the system platformOS on which the profile is being sourced, what follows from the security policy, the concrete shell, loginnonlogin type of the shell, interactivenoninteractive type of shell. The advantage over a wellcrafted generic shell profile as a shell script would be improvement in performance native machine code that may generate a compressedoptimized source code instead of humanwritten script interpretation, robustness type checking, exception handling, compile time verification of functionality, cryptographic signing of the resultant binary executable, capabilities less or no reliance on userland VLI tools, no limitation to use minimum functionality covered by the CLI tools of all possible platforms and crossplatform functionality in practice standards like the Single UNIX Specification only mean so much, and many shell profile concepts carry over to NonUnix platforms like Windows, with its PowerShell, too.p  pstrongImplementation details, side issuesstrongp  ol liThe programmer should be able to control the degree of genericity of the generated shell script. For example, it could be that the binary executable is run every time and puts out the shell profile code that is appropriate, or it could simply generate a fixed shell script file tailored to the circumstances of one run. In the latter case, the listed advantages  in particular those for robustness e.g. exception handling and reliance on userland tools are far more limited. strong[ADDED]strongli liWhether the resultant shell script would be in some form of universal shell script like GNU autoconf generates or shellnative script adapted  dynamically or not to a specific shell is not a primary question to me.li lieasy It seems to me that this can be realized by basically having available functions in a library for the basic shell builtins. Such a function would simply convert itself plus the passed arguments to a semantically appropriate and syntactically correct shell script statement as a string.li ol  pThank you for any further thoughts, and especially for concrete suggestionsp

Although the documentation is good there are no examples beyond copying and pasting a URL in a browser.p  pWhat I would like is an HTML page in S3, so no server side code allowed, to have a text field form that when the search button is clicked fires to my CloudSearch end point and returns the resultsp  pCloudSearch responds with JSON, so will have to parse that and make a table of the results.p  pSo far I have been working with a saved JSON of the results locally and using Jquery to read the JSON filep  precodeltDOCTYPE htmlgt lthtml langengt ltheadgt     ltmeta charsetutf8 gt     lttitlegtJSON Samplelttitlegt ltheadgt ltbodygt     ltdiv idplaceholdergtltdivgt     ltscript srchttpcode.jquery.comjquery1.7.1.min.jsgtltscriptgt     ltscriptgt   .getJSONsearch.json, functiondata       var outputltulgt         for var i in data.hit              outputltligt  data.hit[i].id ltligt                   outputltulgt         document.getElementByIdplaceholder.innerHTMLoutput          console.logdata        ltscriptgt ltbodygt lthtmlgt codepre  pThis gives me the ID for the record.p  pBut when I try and change the URL to the CloudSearch end point I get no data back.

Negative 1231 pI want to do something simple which is create my own list class that is based on java.util.linkedlist but i want to limit what can be done. Lets just say that for now, the only method I want available is the addFirst method. Im creating somewhat of a singly linked list. The issue im having is that addFirst doesnt seem to be recognized and im not sure if im creating the list properly inside my own constructor. Here is the code I have so far.p  precodeimport java.util.LinkedList   public class singleList   singleList       new LinkedList      void addname addName        addFirstaddName      public static void mainString[] args   singleList nameList  new singleList   name name1  new nameJohn, Smith  nameList.addname1   System.out.printlnLinkedList contains    nameList     codepre  pSo as you can see what I want to do is create a list called nameList and at this point, the ONLY thing it can do is use the add method, which should call the LinkedLists addFirst method which adds the element to the first position in the list. Does this make sensep  pThe first error I get is that it cannot find the symbol addFirst from my add method and im also not sure if my constructor for singleList is correct.p  h2In case anyone is wondering, this is for a school assignment.h2  pHere is the revised code, which I took some advise from the first answer here which looks similiar to another.p  precodepublic class SingleList   private LinkedList internalList  SingleList       internalList  new LinkedList    void addname addName      internalList.addFirstaddName   String getint index       return internalList.getindex.toString     public static void mainString[] args       SingleList nameList  new SingleList      name name1  new nameJohn, Smith     nameList.addname1      String getter  nameList.get0       System.out.printlnLinkedList contains    nameList.get0    codepre

Negative 1231 pOk  first of all I know this isnt ideal  however we have inherited a problem and some badly thought out SSI html.p  pSo some background We have implemented a responsive site which has to include some SSI code from the client for global top nav and footer  so far so good. However the SSI needs to change from DESKTOP to MOBILE as the site is resizedloaded on a mobile device. We do all this client side at the moment. We have a trigger at break points to alter the dom to do all the responsive stuff.p  pA similar example is here a hrefhttpwww.conrandesigngroup.com relnofollowhttpwww.conrandesigngroup.coma. Resize the browser to see what happens.p  pNormally we would load the SSI into holding pages and AJAX the code in to the appropriate place using some kind of selector.p  pThe problem The SSI is not fully formed HTML, it looks something like thisp  precodelt desktop ssi gt ltheadgt ltbodygt Whole bunch of desktop html... ltdiv classcontentgt codepre  pThen the SSI we have for the mobile site isp  precodelt mobile ssi gt ltscriptgtsome script...ltscriptgt ltheadgt ltbodygt Whole bunch of mobile html... ltdiv classcontentgt codepre  pSo you will notice there is a closingcodeltheadgtcode and an opening codeltbodygtcode and at the end there is an opening codeltdivgtcode. So there is no way we can select this and replace using the DOM. We were thinking of using comments either side of the code and using a javascript regex to replace the code. Im not sure if this would actually update the browser.p  pSo in desktop mode the whole page will look like thisp  precodelthtmlgt lttitlegtmy pagelttitlegt ltheadgt ...all the head stuff lt START of ssi gt lt desktop ssi gt ltheadgt ltbodygt Whole bunch of desktop html... ltdiv classcontentgt lt END of SSI gt ...all the page HTML ltdivgt ltbodygt lthtmlgt codepre  pSo thats fine  the HTML is all put together serverside and we can open and close the tags correctly. The problem is how would we change the HTML INSIDE the comments using client side code codelt START of ssi gt...lt END of SSI gtcodep  pIn the end its not really a SSI question  rather a way to change a bit of HTML which is not wrapped up nicely in an element.p  pAnyone come across this issue before or have any suggestionsp

Negative 1231 pSo in my universal app I have a section where a person can look at an existing list of notes from our system retrieved through a simple web service and then also create a new note if they want.

Negative 1231 pIn .NET libraries and also in many thirdparty libraries, I can see that there is some convention in how to change the internal private member values, they support Properties .NET Properties or methods these are commonly used in java as Setters and Getters or both for programmers.p  pI wonder when and why using Properties, methods, or both. For example, the visibility of a control can be changed using either strongVisiblestrong property in Windows Forms or call to method strongShowstrong or strongHidestrong. There are some values I understand that there are some internalprivate values which can be changed only via calls to methods like setters. When designing my own controls, classes Im a little hesitative to choose Properties or methods or support both, in fact, choosing either is also OK Java is an example which uses only methods. I know the advantage of Properties over methods as getters and setters but if so why do we have to use methods in some cases, they are presented to the programmers or even replace properties. Im a bit confused at this, and for me as I said, I feel OK when using only methods like as I do in java, its not so bad .p  pI would like to know your experience and also your convention on this to follow. I like following standard conventions in programming for each programming environment and each language to differentiate between them. Not like some ones who invent their own styles which are a little illegible to other programmers such as using C naming convention even PHP naming convention in C a little weird to me, sorry.p  pPlease share, thanks...p
Negative 1231 pIn our project we use parse on declarative syntax to instantiate our modules.  We have a build process that builds our dojo, generic and functional layers for us.  In one of our functions, the parser is complaining that some of the modules arent defined Whats also odd is that the modules arent being auto required either.  Ive confirmed that the layer is included in the page and that the modules are included in the layer.  I can require the modules after the parse and they return the proper constructors.  No errors are being reported the attempt to retrieve the module is in a trycatch.  p  pI feel like something silly is happening, but I cant find it. Any suggestions on how to troubleshoot would be helpful.p  pIve tried both parseOnLoad our default and calling parse seperately, even after a 10 second timeout.p

Negative 1231 pI am having trouble detecting the Exception that is thrown by the inapppurchase store during Unit Test Beta app for Windows Phone 8 when I press the Cancel or Back button on the phone.  The app simply exits. p  pThere are no errors when I use the MockIAP. Cancel or Back Button returns an empty receipt variable during the codeawait receipt  Store..code.  It is handled correctly in MockIAP. But apparently Unit Test and the real app Store handleds Cancel or Back events differently. The app simply exits, which I believe because it is throwing an unhandled error. p  pMy app is a Phonegap 2.3 and the purchase part is handled by the plugin. Unlike the MockIAP, I cant see i.e. attach break points what is happening on the wrapper side when Cancel or Back button is pressed during purchase.  I have tried showing codeMessageBox.Showcode for every step of the purchase.  The codeMessageBox.Showcode code is working when I press confirm purchase but not when I press Cancel or Back Button.  I have made it synchronous already with codeEventWaitHandlecode. p  pIn addition, I have set codee.Handled  truecode for the unhandled Exception event to try to stop it from exit the app with no luck. p  pFrom online, my purchase code is boilerplate, so I dont understand why other people hasnt come across this problem before, and why there are no solutions online.

Negative 1231 pIm trying to find an efficient method of detecting whether a given graph G has two different minimal spanning trees. Im also trying to find a method to check whether it has 3 different minimal spanning trees. The naive solution that Ive though about is running Kruskals algorithm once and finding the total weight of the minimal spanning tree. Later , removing an edge from the graph and running Kruskals algorithm again and checking if the weight of the new tree is the weight of the original minimal spanning tree , and so for each edge in the graph. The runtime is OVElogV which is not good at all, and I think theres a better way to do it.p  pAny suggestion would be helpful, thanks in advancep

Negative 1231 pI have currently coded a registration page with facebook on one of my netsuite sites. The thing that I am having an issue with is, I do not know how to take the data from the registration page and have it be read onto another script and then sent over to the netsuite registration page.p  pNetsuite has not integrated facebook with their site yet, and were limited to what we can do on there, which makes this problem a little scarce. p  pThis is the third step to my problem and I should be solved.

Negative 1231 pSo I am displaying a web page using the django framework.  Now, I get asynchronous POST responses from the foursquare API when ever someone checks in to one of my locations.p  pThis is kind of an odd problem.p  pMy question What would be the best way to update the webpage, without refreshing it, whenever my server receives a POST response from the foursquare API servers. For now, in the view for handling the POST response, I just update some context variables and use those variables in another view to display stuff, but obviously the changes show only after refreshing the page.p  pI have looked into AJAX and understand that it is useful when client is aware of some event happening, which then makes a call to a function to receive some values and update part of a page like some div.p  pBut in my case the client is not aware of any such event since the request is getting generate when someone checks in and the response is coming from the foursquare servers to my server.p  pI there some way to deal with this I have looked into dajax and dajaxice, but couldnt find how they could be useful.p  pI have seen some solutions in which I could add some JQuery to query the server at small regular intervals, but that does not seem optimal.p  pAny suggestions on what I should look intop  pTurns out, web socket wont cut it, since I do not have any events occurring at the client side and I do not need full duplex communication and Comet seems to be a heavy framework.I am looking into other stuff.

Negative 1231 pI have a game concept being designed in UDK, using a firstperson camera. By default, you can only look i.e. rotate the camera so far up and so far down, but the effect I want to achieve is for the player to be able to look down at themselves so they can see the feet of the player characters model, as you can in the game Outlast for anyone whos familiar with that.p  pIm a programmer more than a designer, so Im hoping theres a scripting solution to this.  I presume I need to extend one or more of the Camera, PlayerController and Pawn classes, but Ive had a browse through them and cant quite find what Im looking for. Presumably there are min and max values for rotation angles hiding somewherep  pAny suggestions would be appreciated.p

Negative 1231 pIm working on a QwtPlot  I have a regular time scale on X axis and a custom y scale with discrete valuesp  pThe problem is that when Im zooming the discrete Axis it has major ticks only with a magnifier, the ticks on the scale start repeating themselves and instead of getting  e.g. 2 ticks 0 and 1 Im getting 4 ticks 0, 0, 1, 1 or more, depends on the zoom. So because the divider cant divide the values, it just repeats them. p  pNo idea what function or object to usereimplement to make the scale stop drawing additional divisions and btw also additional grid lines. Just stopping the magnifier from magnifying too much isnt the right answer since I want it to magnify more.p  pWhat I did to my discrete y axis in CPlot inheriting QwtPlot isp  blockquote precodeQListltdoublegt ticks forint i0 iltvisualisationgtgetPIDs.sizei      ticks.appendi  QwtScaleDiv divnew QwtScaleDiv0,visualisationgtgetPIDs.size1 divgtsetTicksQwtScaleDivMajorTick, ticks discreteScalenew CDiscreteScaleDraw discreteScalegtsetLUTvisualisationgtgetPIDs setAxisScaleDrawQwtPlotyLeft, discreteScale setAxisMaxMinorQwtPlotyLeft,0 thisgtsetAxisAutoScaleQwtPlotyLeft, 0 codepre blockquote  pPS. On my time scale I have a similar problem, but this is the case of precision  when zooming in I would like to get the precision of 123,456.789 and I get 123,456.78 and then the labels get doubled, tripled etc again. I would also like to remove the coma that QwtScaleDraw puts there so that I would get 123456.789, but the most important thing is getting rid of repeating labels.p

Negative 1231 pAs a learning experiment i have been working on creating a 2d java game using LibGDX. I have a REALLY big problem with hardcoding but iv never been able to do anything about it. until recently when i finally figured out how to use saxdom effectively, then found JDOM. I started to understand that with a good API like JDOM, it would be very possible to implement a  user made Object named say... GameObject  in every class that gets used. this object would have methods that can construct any of the objects that are included in the program. as well as an ArrayList which would hold all of the objects created... the problem i am running into is that i cant extend from multiple classes, so i have no way to take the Actor class from scene2d and extend it so that it can parse the JDOM document, and fill its arraylist...p  pmy question is this is there a way to completely remove the hardcoding of object structures by having them defined in an xml file, such that object data that would be hardcoded can be altered at runtimep  phere is some example code... its probably not perfect but it will hopefully get the idea acrossp  pGameObject... this is the class i want EVERY object

Thats why the image disappears.p  pI had a version that kept the background... but the sccontainer box didnt resize like we need... the text just overflowed it... rather ugly.p  pI dont know enough CSS to make this all work right.  Im not adverse to using jQuery to do more if needed.p  pI did work on a version that handled most of the hover using the hover stuff... but it didnt work quite as well as the jQuery approach.p
Negative 1231 pI have a fullscreen css3 cube that is responsive and rotates, BUT the one things I cannot for the life of me figure out is the bottom side of the cube.  It doesnt position correctly, and Im pretty sure it has to do with the translateZ javascript Ive written for it, but I could be wrong. You can see it onload, but it becomes very clear whats wrong with the bottom when you resize the browsers width. Thanks so much for any help with this.

Negative 1231 pIn ExtendScript, Ive run up against a very strange scenario with which I need some help from a ScriptUI guru.  Ive got a huge InDesign script that, during the course of its execution, displays a progress bar in a palette window. codevar w  new Windowpalette, Progresscode  I would like this palette to be closed when the script is finished, so I added a codew.closecode at the end of the script.p  pHowever, this only occurs if the focus is still in InDesign.  Some of our people like to work on other tasks while the InDesign script is running on another screen in the background, which is fine, but when they return to InDesign, that progress bar palette is still on the screen, showing 100 completion.  This palette window can be moved around, but it emcannotem be closed, even if the little red x in the corner is clicked.  This eventually leads to multiple palettes staying on the screen throughout the day, as this script is called dozens of times in a normal workday.p  pReading Peter Kahrels excellent guide to ScriptUI, I learned that all palettes remain in memory, even after being closed with code.closecode.  I want them completely erased from memory and purged, so they dont stay on the screen if the user switches to another application while the script is running.  Any ideas on how to accomplish thisp  pBy the way, I wanted to include some sample code so you could see for yourself, but it doesnt seem to work when its just some small code called from with the ESTK only in my 4,647line production script.  Thus, I cannot paste any example code.p

But its not the solution because you wont know what the underscore prefixed member will be. If you define your own pseudoprivate member with the underscore, the super pseudoprivate member may be the same name with yours. You will probably devastate the encapulation of superior. I emulate a situation as belowp  precodevar util  requireutil var events  requireevents var   requireunderscore  function MyStream      events.EventEmitter.callthis     this.events     util.inheritsMyStream, events.EventEmitter  .extendMyStream.prototype,      write functiondata         this.events  This will override the super member and undermine the events list         this.emitdata, data     ,      on function         console.logmy on         events.EventEmitter.prototype.on.applythis, arguments     ,      constructor MyStream   var stream  new MyStream  console.logstream instanceof events.EventEmitter  true console.logstream instanceof MyStream  true  stream.ondata, functiondata      console.logReceived data   data    stream.writeIt works  Received data It works codepre  pExcute the code and it will not output Received data It works unless you comment the line             this.events  This will override the super member and undermine the events listp  pI thought the solution myself for some while only fix that maybe I could use the pattern as it was used in python. If you got a member of a class named YourClass with a prefix of , just like yourMember in python, the python compiler will change the name to ClassnameyourMember. All of the private member will be prefixed with Classname. If the class name is unique, your private members will be unique too. Javascript doesnt have the compiling mechanism as python, so I should define it on my own. Change the former code as belowp  precodevar util  requireutil var events  requireevents var   requireunderscore  function MyStream      events.EventEmitter.callthis     this.MyStream           events ,         maxListeners 0        util.inheritsMyStream, events.EventEmitter  .extendMyStream.prototype,      write functiondata         this.MyStream.events  This will not override the super member but its odd         this.emitdata, data     ,      on function         console.logmy on         events.EventEmitter.prototype.on.applythis, arguments     ,      constructor MyStream   var stream  new MyStream  console.logstream instanceof events.EventEmitter  true console.logstream instanceof MyStream  true  stream.ondata, functiondata      console.logReceived data   data    stream.writeIt works  Received data It works codepre  pBut its odd to write code like this and Im sure few of libaries written like this. How could I trust to use these libs as if they didnt break the libs they are inherting You see the core source code of node.js is simple, but when you build a large scale project using node.js with a lot of third party lib, will you be bothered by the anxiety of private naming conflicts p  pMaybe someone will say to use the module pattern of javascript. I know it and it of course will not solve the problem I ask here.p  pIs there any way to solve this or I just made something wrong for my questionp

Negative 1231 pIm pulling information from CRM to generate a soap message to be sent to a server. The problem is that CRM uses GUIDs for id and the Xsd for the SOAP server requires a int. p  pIs there a table that tracks all entity creations and their associated GUID Id My thinking is that I can simply create  a trigger on this table and map the GUID to a Int in a lookup table so that I can replace the GUID with a int ID. Any other suggestions are welcomep

Negative 1231 pSo as of right now I have bluestacks 0.8.4 rooted and was testing to see if there is a way to fool an app into thinking it was on a different device. I have an app that reset my bluestacks to appear as another device. Which has fooled some apps. Another countermeasure is to remove user input detection so apps think im using touch input. I have reprogrammed the interface to only detect touch interface. However I cant seem to find how else apps can detect bluestacks. Lastly I tried doing the same with genymotion android emulator with the same failure and apps still detect.  The only other thing I can think that is still allowing detection is some android setting im not thinking of. Any ideasp

Negative 1231 pIve been fiddling around with setTimeout and setInterval, and I cannot get the code to execute the way I would like it to. My goal is to create a setInterval, which calls once every three seconds, and have it clear after ten seconds.

Negative 1231 pThe issue I have is locking on both indexes. p  pTo explain, when constructing the EmbeddedSolrServer server I have to parse the codeCoreContainercode and the core name and so I have constructed two seperate instances of the codeEmbeddedSolrServercode, one for each core. Now I essentially do this example codep  precodeserverInstanceOne.adddocument serverInstanceTwo.adddocument  This fails to obtain a lock codepre  ol liIf serverInstanceOne is purely targeting core1, why does it create a lock in the index of core2li liIs there a way to prevent this Or a way of forcing the server to drop the lock without shutting down each timeli ol  pI have tried to find in the Solr documentation an explanation around this behaviour but am at a loss still. Essentially I am using multicore and have a spring batch job, which is using the codeEmbeddedSolrServercode to pump data overnight into some indexes.p

However joomla 2.5 does not support PSR0 autoloading so I figured that I would have to write my own implementation.p  pSince I want to use my classes across my entire joomla installation I decided to write a plugin which registers the classes codeonAfterInitialisecode but this is where it goes wrong it overrides joomlas autoloading methods.p  pThe library im trying to implement is located at codelibrariesZohoCRMZohoClient.phpcode with several subfolders.

Negative 1231 pSo, on my code, I have an anchor to which I added a before in order to create a css triangle. Im trying to get an opacity transition to display the triangle whenever you hover over the anchor. But for some reason a lot of times if you rush in on the link it skips the transition and it shows the triangle with full opacity, however, if you gently hover through just about the border of the link the transition works. Im wondering what it is that Im doing wrong...  Also, I noticed if Im not being crazy that on jsFiddle it works a little better, but then again, I did change my code slightly to include just this part. You might have to play with it a little, from different angles, to see what Im saying.p  pLastly, the transition does not apply when you move the pointer from outside the anchor.p  pHere is my codecodecode  a hrefhttpjsfiddle.netdeathandtaxesPhE592 relnofollowJSFIDDLEap

Negative 1231 pThe machine on which I develop has more memory than the one on which the code will eventually run. I dont have access tothe machine on which it will actually run. This is a 64 bit application and I intend to use the address space but cap physical allocation. I dont want to lock down virtual memory, only physical memory. Is there a way to set limits on a linux machine such that it mimics a system with low RAM. I think codeulimitcode does not differentiate between reserved address space vs actual allocation. If there is a way to do it without rebooting with different kernel parameters or, pulling out extra RAM that would be great. May be some proc tricks.p

Negative 1231 pIm building a simple realtime chat app to learn how to use websockets with RoR and I dont think Im understanding how channels work because theyre not doing what I expect. I can successfully send a message to my Rails app using the codedispatcher.triggercode method, and use my websocket controller to broadcast a message to all clients that subscribe to the channel. That all works fine. What does NOT work is using a channel via the codechannel.triggercode method to send a message to other clients. The websocketrails wiki says...p  blockquote   pChannel events currently happen outside of the Event Router flow. They   are meant for broadcasting events to a group of connected clients   simultaneously. If you wish to handle events with actions on the   server, trigger the event on the main dispatcher and specify which   controller action should handle it using the Event Router.p blockquote  pIf I understand this correctly, I should be able to user the codechannel.triggercode method to broadcast a message to clients connected to the channel, without the message being routed through my RoR app, but it should still reach the other connected clients. So heres my code...p  precodevar dispatcher  new WebSocketRailslocalhost3000websocket var channel  dispatcher.subscribechannelname  channel.bindchannelmessage, functiondata      alertdata.message   sendmessagebutton.clickfunction      obj  message test     channel.triggerchannelmessage, obj  codepre  pWith the code listed above, I would expect that when I click the button, it sends a channel message using codechannel.triggercode and the codechannelmessagecode binding should be executed on all clients, displaying an alert that reads test. That doesnt happen. Im using Chrome tools to inspect the websocket traffic and it shows the message being sent...p  precode[channelmessage,id113458,channelchannelname,datamessagetest,token96fd4f5163214309941f38110635f86f] codepre  p...but no message is received. My questions are...p  ol liAm I misunderstanding how channelbased websockets work with the websocketrails gemli liIf not, what am I doing wrongli ol  pThanks in advance for all your wisdomp
Negative 1231 pIm trying to build a Preferences dialog using JQuery UI and its dialog. I have several checkboxes the user can set. When the dialog opens, I set these checkboxes based on an internal Preferences list.p  pThis works fine the first time I display the dialog, but on subsequent opens the dialog retains its last settings, even when Preferences havent changed. That is, the visual appearance is retained, while the Preferences values havent been changed.p  pIf I revert to using plain old HTML checkboxes, they work correctly. Its only the JQuery UI checkboxes that stubbornly hold onto their last state.p  pThis seems to be a pernicious problem, but there arent any clear answers or examples on how to fix it. One approach  manually destroying, then rewriting the entire dialog on every call  seems utterly frustrating, and Im hoping theres some better way of handling this problem while still being able to use JQuery UI widgets.p

Negative 1231 pI just recently moved my working modx site to my local system from the shared hosting server I have it on.  On the server LAMP friendly URLs work fine. On my local computer WAMP friendly URLs produce a 404 error though, as described by others the actual URL looks correct it just doesnt work. To be specific my local is windows 8 brServer Apache ver 2.2.29 brLocal Apache ver 2.2.25 theres no windows installer for 2.2.29 brPHP on server 5.4 brPHP on local 5.4p  pImportant All other capabilities of modx seem to work just fine on my local. I did follow the official a hrefhttprtfm.modx.comrevolution2.xadministeringyoursitemovingyoursitetoanewserver relnofollowmodx instructionsa for moving a revolution site from one place to another. In addition it might be valuable to point out that I added an entry in my hosts file to point the domain to localhost so the domain doesnt change... in that way anything that depends on the domain wont break when I move it from my local dev environment to the server.p  pstrongWhat Ive done to researchstrong brSearched extensively on the internet amp here on stackoverflow.

This also did not help. I also manually deleted everything out of the cache file, this also didnt help amp last I turned friendly URLs off, verified that I could get to the resources, then turned them back on. This last effort also did not help.p

I am bringing the Landscape orientation to my iPad app now. p  pI have it configured so that the in Portrait, the codeMaster Viewcode is hidden behind a codeUIBarButtonItemcode and in Landscape, the Master and Detail view are both showing. I have built custom themes within my app which changes the background and the codeUINavigationBarcode to match the selected theme. p  pstrongIssuestrongp  pWhen in Landscape and in the theme selection page, the Master view is the Menu codeUITableViewControllercode and the Detail is the Theme selection page codeUICollectionViewcode.

Negative 1231 pI have been up and down these forums looking for a solution to my problem.  Ive been trying all types of code examples here to fix my issue, but it just wont go away.  p  pstrongThe System Goals and Environmentstrong br I am implementing what amounts to a simple CRUD interface for a backend mysqlite DB.  p  pNavigationwise, I have the action bar spinner bar that has dropdown items that, when selected, show the individual relations in the DB people, place, thing in seperate fragment.  On the other side, i am using the overflow menu as the contextbased options menu, with selections such as Create, Delete, Edit that spawn their own fragment which is populated or not with the attributes of the selected DB object.  On this form, i have buttons to add a media attachment, and a button to add an icon.p  pstrongHow My Code is Arrangedstrong br I am running all of this through a single activity because i am using a ORMLite singleton datasource connection.  In my main activity java file, i handle all of the category fragment navigation.  So, when the user selects a category from the spinner or an option from the overflow list, the main activityor so i think spawns off the appropriate fragment and pass the DB helper along with it.  p  pI basically have 1 main XML Layout for the main activity 1 layout for the category listview fragment, and 1 layout for the Create  Edit  Delete fragment.  p  pstrongThe Problemstrong br  When I have...        1  selected a category and the main activity has displayed the category results in the category fragment..       2  go then to Create an object, and spawn the CRUD fragment..       3  hit the add attachment button, go through the gallery, select an image..       4  and then strongthe system displays the previous accessed category fragmentstrong instead of returning back to the CRUD fragment with the attached image in its appropriate ImageView container.  I know that the system has selected the image because i have a Toast set up to pop up the file path of the selected image, so i know the gallery is working as intended.p  pNow heres the weird part.  If i go directly to Create, and add media, it works just fine  the system grabs the image from the gallery, goes back to the CRUD fragment and puts it in the appropriate ImageView.p  pSo basically, my issue is this  it works when i go directly to the CRUD fragment.  It does not work if i go to the Category fragment, and then to the CRUD fragment.p  pHELP im going out of my mind herep  pHeres my code.  I have no logcat because this does not generate exceptions.  p  pstrongMy MainActivity where i dispatch the appropriate fragment based on user inputstrongbrp  precodeOverride public boolean

Negative 1231 pIm trying to find a way to use EasyMock to test only a method execute in class Foo, expect the number of times a method in a Mock object is invoked by that method, but ignoring the number of times the same method in the mock object is invoked by the helper methods of the same class Foo when called by method execute.

Negative 1231 pI have to use a camera SDK for a microscope that comes with a sample C Windows Forms application. The SDK functions are imported to the app via DLLImport. In this sample application the single frames from the camera are read from RAM via a callback function. This callback function then updates a PictureBox to show the live image.p  pFor my useage however I want to not only show the frames, but also record them. I think the easiest way to do this is by using a hrefhttpsharpavi.codeplex.com relnofollowSharpAvia. However I dont know how to initialize the AviWriter I obviously cant initialize it everytime the callback fires and then add the single frames to the stream from the callback function.p  pAt the moment I solved my problem by using another function that waits in a seperate thread for a public counter to go up  the counter itself is updated in the callback function. Everytime the counter is updated this function then also reads the frame from RAM and adds it to the AviWriterStream. To top it of I had to make the thread block my UI by using p  precodevar resetEvent  new ManualResetEventfalse  System.Threading.ThreadPool.QueueUserWorkItemdelegate       WriteAVI     resetEvent.Set  , null  resetEvent.WaitOne  codepre  pThis is due to the fact that I need to record several videos at different XY positions  so everytime my for loop arrives at a new XY position the recording is triggered and I have to make sure to only move to the next position once the recording is actually finished.p  pMy way of doing this is obviously hackish and very bad practice I already feel bad but just dont know better and I am wondering what the correct solution would be. So far it works  just the UI freeze is really annoying.p  pEdit These are probably two questions 1 How to correctly write frames to the AVI and 2 How to wait for the recording to be completed without making it freeze my UIp

Negative 1231 pI have built a library project B which is dependant of some jars imported C. then I created a liferay pluging project A which require library from B so i imported B in deployment assembly. but when running portlet A throught the portal some exception raised saying that object type from C are not found when successfully deploying from eclipse.

Negative 1231 pWere in the process of rewriting our code in OOP and Im trying to design a general framework for future projects mostly to comply with DRY and keep the code slim and consistent.p  pFor example I think it would be nice to have a base class codeDatabaseObjectcode, which would source its properties from a database row. It would among other things use codecallcode and codepropertyexistscode to automate most getters. That way wed dont have to potentially write all 100 getters for every column in the database row or update the class code with every change to the table.p  pOther classes like codeCustomercode, codeCarcode or codeArticlecode would extend codeDatabaseObjectcode if theyre sourced from a database and inherit these methods, so we dont have to copy the database specific code into every class separately which would just get more and more inconsistent over time.p  pIs this the correct...ish use of inheritance in a web project, or is this bad design My colleague argues that this is somewhat a misuse of inheritance and that a customer sourced from a CSV file would need a separate class definition, which is a valid point.p  pWith Interfaces wed still have to copy the code into every class and traits aside from requiring PHP 5.4 would not work for my codecallcode example above I think.p  pSo is there a better approach to my codeDatabaseObjectcode conceptp  pstrongEditstrong Could someone explain the reason for the downvotes to me, so I can maybe delete and resubmit my question in a proper wayp

Negative 1231 pI have to ask you a question Im studying some cases to create a RESTFul WS for an App. After some days, I decided to start developing it in PHP. Im doing a POPO Object using also the Abstract strongJsonSerializablestrong class. Well, the server side is done Now I want to automate the iOS side building iOS classes conform to the POPO Object. Then, when iOS receive the data from the connection, I want to reflect the data to find the correct class. I think about a process like thisp  pstrongNSData  NSDictionary  Reflection  POPO iOS Classstrongp  pWell, the strongReflectionstrong step is still on working because I really dont want to analyze all the NSDictionary to find the correct POPO. I will not do things such as below...p  precodeif [dictionary.firstObject isKindOfClass [POPObject class]]      POPObject popo  [[POPObject alloc] initWithObj dictionary.firstObject]     return popo  codepre  pIm not doing this because some POPOObject will contain NSArray property that will contain other POPObjects So, maybe is better if I elaborate something of recursive... I will explain it well. Think at a JSON like thisp  precode   firstFatherObj      firstObject true,     secondObject        firstProperty  true,       secondProperty Prop        ,   httpstatus 200  codepre  pIt is a sample example, but there will be some secondthirdfourthetc... level of subclasses and it will be more expensive and really heavy. Any ideas Thanksp  h2ADDINGh2  pIm thinking about some Abstract ResponseObject that they will group more POPObject in iOS. So, when I do a call to the server, I know something about the response I will wait for. So Im going to create this Abstract and Im going to delegate it the parsing stuff to its related POPObject.  An example Im going to ask to the server some information about the logged user. I havent to check for all the POPObject that surely they are not all about emUSERem, but I instantiate the strongResponseUserstrong object that will parse the JSON and it will understand which is the suitable class ex userPosts, userPreferences and others...  What do you think about itp

The Firefox browser loads up and I start stepping through and all looks good. Then I hit one of these Source not found errors, of which there are many. Ive attached a screenshot here, which gives an example....a hrefhttpi.imgur.comaDxCAX0.png relnofollowhttpi.imgur.comaDxCAX0.pngap  pI know it asks to Edit Source Lookup Path, but Im not sure what I should be referencing As far as Im aware Ive attached all the selenium jar files, so Im not sure where Im going wrong.p

Negative 1231 pWe are currently preparing hazelcast for going live in the next weeks. There is still one bigger issue left, that troubles our OPs department and could be a possible show stopper in case we cannot fix it. p  pSince we are maintaining a high availability payment application, we have to survive in case the cluster ist not available. Reasons could be p  ol liSomeone messed up the hazelcast configuration and a map on the cluster increases until we have OOM had this on the test system. li liThere is some issue with the network cardshardware that temporary breaks the connection to the cluster li liOPs guys reconfigured the firewall and accidentaly blocked some ports that are necessary, whatosoever.li liWhatever elseli ol  pI spent some time on finding good existing solution, but the only solution so far was to increase the number of backup servers, which of course does not solve the case. p  pDuring my current tests the application completely stopped working because after certain retries the clients disconnect from the cluster and the hibernate 2nd level cache is no longer working. Since we are using hazelcast throughout the whole ecosystem this would kill 40 java clients almost instantly. p  pThus I wonder how we could achieve that the applications are still working in a of course slower manner when the cluster is down. Our current approach is to switch over to ehcache local cache but I think there should be hazelcast solution for that problem as well p

Negative 1231 pIm new to swift and have been playing around with this code all day.  I think I know where the problem is, but Im not quite sure how to solve it.  I have a view controller that contains a UIImageView and Im looking to simply make multiple copies of the same UIImageView at each touch point as the user enters the touchesMoved function.  I created an array to store the elements of all the locations the user had touched and used array.append in the touchesMoved function to collect the points.  I then created a loop that would read in these CGPoints and assign a UIImageView to the point.  The problem is that CGPoints are not convertible to UIImageViews.  Any suggestions on how I can go about this problemp  precodeimport UIKit import CoreGraphics  class ViewController UIViewController       var wayPoints [CGPoint]  []     var location  CGPointx 0, y 0      IBOutlet var Person  UIImageView      func movePoint          for var i  0 i lt wayPoints.count i              let p  wayPoints[i]              if i  0                  CGPointMakep.x, p.y                          else                  CGPointMakep.x, p.y                           var Person  wayPoints[i]                     override func touchesBegantouches NSSet, withEvent event UIEvent          var touch  UITouch  touches.anyObject as UITouch         location  touch.locationInViewself.view         Person.center  location            override func touchesMovedtouches NSSet, withEvent event UIEvent          var touch  UITouch  touches.anyObject as UITouch         location  touch.locationInViewself.view         Person.center  location         wayPoints.appendlocation             override func viewDidLoad          super.viewDidLoad          Do any additional setup after loading the view, typically from a nib.

I used it because 1. I found that UIImageView copies would mean poor performance and 2. for every five layer copies I make, I want to be able to animate the contentsScale of the layer by 120.  I realize the animation right now is for cornerRadius but thats the only animation that I got to work.  The syntax is alright, but I think my semantics are still a bit off.  The image follows my cursor while I drag and I think layers are being created because theres just a little bit of lag in the trail.

Since then Ive generated a subset for the components pH in this example where I copied over the results column to a new pH column, thinking I could match the keys and update a new pH column in the main result set.p  pSince not all result values are numeric with values like codeNot recordedcode I attempted to use numerics like code888code or other values which could substitute so I could force at least the result and pH columns to be numeric. Aside from the dates which are codePOSIXctcode values, the remaining columns are codecharactercode columns.

The field in question TotalSeconds definitely exists on the captions table and, as the comments show below, the codeTotalSecondscode string also exists at least prior to the update attempt   and yet all attempts to update the TotalSeconds field with the codeTotalSecondscode string value are failing.  The TotalSeconds field, by the way, is of the type codeDECIMAL11,3code which must be related to my problem, since Im new to using that field type.p  precodeTotalSecondsREQUEST[TotalSeconds]   NOTE I can get the TotalSeconds string variable to echo successfully before the update attempt below   resultmysqlqueryUPDATE captions SET TotalSecondsTotalSeconds WHERE IDThisID or diemysqlerror kmysqlaffectedrows codepre  pAnd yet the UPDATE operation above never works.  The affected rows value always  0.  And yet I have nine other fields which are set to update the same way, and none of the others give me any trouble at all.p  pAny ideas would be greatly appreciated.p  pThanks, Brianp

Negative 1231 pI need a Python program that I am working on to be able to take a small image, determine if it exists inside a larger image, and if so, report its location.  If not, report that.  In my case, the large image will be a screenshot, and the small image an image that may or may not be on the screen, in an HTML5 canvas.  Looking on line, I found out about template matching in OpenCV, which does have excellent Python bindings.  I tried the following, based on very similar code I found on line, using numpy as wellp  precodeimport cv2 import numpy as np image  cv2.imreadscreenshot.png template  cv2.imreadbutton.png result  cv2.matchTemplateimage,template,cv2.TMCCOEFFNORMED StartButtonLocation  np.unravelindexresult.argmax,result.shape codepre  pThis doesnt do what I need it to do, because it ALWAYS returns a point in the larger image the point where the match is closest, no matter how terrible a match it is.  I want something that finds an exact, pixel for pixel match of the smaller image in the larger image, and if none exists, raises an exception, or returns codeFalsecode, or something like that.  And, it needs to be fairly quick.  Does anyone have a good idea about how to do thisp

I thought I could force the use of references withp  precodeconst Comparator ampref  c stdsortv.begin, v.end, ref codepre  pbut copies still happen with this. Is there a way to prevent copies, or do I have to make the Comparator store only pointers to heavy data  I dont think we can use lambdaclosures with our compiler version.p

Negative 1231 pIn the project I am currently working on we are running an angular app on an handheld scanner device the model is a Motorola MC9200.p  pWe are using a browser called Zetakey web browser to run the web app. This browser by default has javascript garbage collection turned off in order to maintain a reasonable response time.p  pWe discovered that after about 1.5 hours of use the browser crashes because it is out of memory.p  pAs part of our program we use a page refresh to clear all data during a sort of logout sequence.p  pI think that this is causing the browser to reallocate all the memory on the page and it does not appear to clear the old memory.p  pI was wondering if there is a simple way in angular or javascript to reset the data without explicitly running through and resetting each variable and property.p  p[Edited for grammar]p  pUpdatep  pZetakey has given us an early deployment of their next browser release where they just slow down the garbage collection cycle instead of killing it completely.

Negative 1231 pI would like to place Google Adsense on a website.  My question is if its possible for me to know when a user clicks on an Ad.  It would be enough to know only the very first click when Ad is initially invoked on new Window. I do not care what the user does after the Ad is invoked in the iFrame, since its not possible because of XSS limitations.p  pBelow are some solutions I could think of, but not sure if they will work 100 of the timep  ol lipWrap the iFrame with a DIV and add an onclick handler on the DIV. All I care is about the very first click on Ad is invoked. Not sure if browser will pass the iFrame onclick to the underlying DIV.  Again I only care about the very first click.pli lipListen for a Window onBlur event since I believe when iFrame opens a new window, an onBlur event will be passed on the current Window.  But Im not sure if this will work 100 o the time.  Like what if user manually clicks on a separate browser window Will the onBlur also be passedpli ol  pIf anyone has any ideas please let me know.

Negative 1231 pIve run into an issue with Lumen v5.0.10 that has me at my wits end. Im designing an application largely using TDD with the bundled codephpunitcode extensions. Im basically getting a codeBindingResolutionExceptioncode for AppContractsSubscriberInteractionInterface. This is an interface in the directory emAppContractsem which has an implementation in emAppServicesem which is registered in the codeAppServiceProvidercode like sop  precodeclass AppServiceProvider extends ServiceProvider      public function register                Owner manager         thisgtappgtsingleton             AppContractsOwnerInteractionInterface,             AppServicesOwnerManager                    Subscriber manager         thisgtappgtsingleton             AppContractsSubscriberInteractionInterface,              AppServicesSubscriberManager                 ddthisgtappgtboundAppContractsSubscriberInteractionInterface       codepre  pMy frustration is that if I uncomment that last line in the function then it shows that codeAppContractsSubscriberInteractionInterfacecode has been bound and thus may be resolved. p  pI then have a controller which effectively looks like thisp  precodeclass MyController extends Controller       public function constructLoggerInterface log              thisgtlog  log             public function indexRequest request                 if  Seems to come from owner                             owners  AppmakeAppContractsOwnerInteractionInterface                return ownersgtprocessrequest                         if  Seems to come from subscriber                             subscribers  AppmakeAppContractsSubscriberInteractionInterface                return subscribersgtprocessrequest                   codepre  pI use them in this way because I only want the relevant one instantiated not both as would happen if I typehinted them and they also each have type hinted dependencies in their constructors. p  pThe issue is that the route of the tests that needs codeOwnerInteractionInterfacecode runs just fine but the one that needs codeSubscriberInteractionInterfacecode does not. The implementations and interfaces are largely similar and as I showed before, they are both registered at the same time and I can confirm that codeSubscriberInteractionInterfacecode is bound. In fact, if I put the linep  precodeddAppboundAppContractsSubscriberInteractionInterface codepre  pat the top of codeindexcode it returns strongtruestrong. The tests happen to be ordered such that the path that uses codeOwnerInteractionInterfacecode runs first and it resolves fine and then the other test fails with a codeBindingResolutionExceptioncode. However, if I omit other tests and run just that one, then everything goes smoothly. The tests are in different files and the only setup I do is to bind a mock for a third party API in place of an entirely different binding from those shown and none of that code touches these classes. This is done within a codesetUpcode function and I make sure to call codeparentsetUpcode within it. p  pWhats going on here Could it be that binding one concrete instance wipes nonconcrete bindings from the codeIoCcode Or is it that the default setup allows some influence to transfer over from one test to another p  pI know I sorta have a workaround but the constraint of never running the full testsuite is annoying. Its starting to seem that testing would be easier if I just use the instance directly instead of resolving it from its interface. p  pAlso, does anyone know a way to inspect the codeIoCcode for resolvable bindingsp
Negative 1231 pI read a lot about best practices for design.  Recently, I came across a hrefhttpblog.ploeh.dk20101202Interfacesarenotabstractions relnofollowthis articlea by Mark Seemann.  In this article he states p  blockquote   pDo you extract interfaces from your classes to enable loose coupling   If so, you probably have a 11 relationship between your interfaces   and the concrete classes that implement them. Thats probably not a   good sign, and violates the Reused Abstractions Principle RAP. Ive   been guilty of this and didnt like the result.p blockquote  pNow, I have been using Autofac for many, many years for DI.  Ive noticed that in order to actually implement a concrete class as an interface I basically must violate this principle by creating interfaces for each class that I will need to either swap out the implementation in testing or inject into other services. p  pAn example of this looks likep  precodebuilder.RegisterTypeltAcknowledgementRepositorygt             .AsltIAcknowledgementRepositorygt          builder.RegisterTypeltChangeLogRepositorygt             .AsltIChangeLogRepositorygt          builder.RegisterTypeltHistoryCycleRepositorygt             .AsltIHistoryCycleRepositorygt codepre  pThis is a very common pattern that I see used very frequently.  But, it seems like it might be an indication of bad design.  p  pIm interested in how others avoid creating these header interfaces, it seems like the solution might have to do with using .AsImplementedInterfaces, but I have not played around with it enough.p  pEdit I should note that the repositories above inherit from IGenericRepository, but also extend it in many cases. p

Negative 1231 pIm working with OpenGL at the moment, creating a texture cache which handles loading images and buffering them with OpenGL.

This is not too difficult, its just an array of size Pixels  Colour Channels.p  pI am currently using a stdvector to hold the initial data before I upload it OpenGL. The problem Im having is that I cant find any information on the best way to initialize a vector with a repeating pattern.p  pThe first way that occurred to me was to use a loop.p  precodestdvectorltunsigned chargt bluetexture for int iii  0 iii lt width  height iii      bluetexture.pushback0     bluetexture.pushback0     bluetexture.pushback255     bluetexture.pushback255  codepre  pHowever, this seems inefficient since the vector will have to resize itself numerous times. Even if I reserve space first and perform the loop its still not efficient since the contents will be zeroed before the loop which means two writes for each unsigned char.p  pCurrently Im using the following methodp  precodestruct colour unsigned char r unsigned char g unsigned char b unsigned char a colour blue  0, 0, 255, 255 stdvectorltcolourgt texturewidth  height, blue codepre  pI then extract the data usingp  precodereinterpretcastltunsigned chargttexture.data codepre  pIs there a better way than this Im new to CC and Ill be honest, casting pointers scares me.p

Negative 1231 pIve currently got a single working codeUISearchControllercode implemented inside the header view of a codeUITableViewControllercode. I wish for my other views to also follow suit but some are codeUICollectionViewControllercodes. Is there a way to create one codeUISearchControllercode and just call them across all the views within the headers All of the results must show in a table. p  pI had attempted to create one for each view but the codeUICollectionViewControllercode was giving me some problems. I couldnt figure out how to set and update a table for the search controller. It wouldnt allow me to override the codetableViewcode methods as i guess the controller is a codeCollectionViewcode. p  pAny help is appreciated. p  pEDITp  pShould also add that the search methoddata will be the same across all of the views. See how the stock iOS Music app uses search bars as an example. p  pEDIT 2p  pIve nearly cracked it I think. Ive setup a singleton SharingManager, within this i have 3 arrays.

Negative 1231 pIm working with a programm in which some settings shall be imported by values set in an Pdfform that is editable. Adobe Acrobat DC Pro is the program I use for creation of the Pdfform. Problem is it just has controls like TextBox, ComboBox etc. but no DatePicker. p  pAfter I searched the internet I found the guys from Acroform and they have a Javascript that enables the use of a DatePicker inside of a Pdfform. I downloaded their code from a hrefhttpsacrobatusers.comtutorialsbasicacroformstoolset relnofollowherea and had no problem to get it running but the DatePicker starts with Sunday. I guess that is due to the fact that the Date Enumeration starts with 0  Sunday, 1  Monday etc. but I would like the change the DatePicker to start with Mondaythe way Windows displays a DatePicker, problem is I have no experience in Javascript. I thought that if I just change all the Arrays of Days in the code to Sunday being at the end instead of the start would work but this just makes the dates for MondaySaturday to be empty and then it starts with Sunday and paints on to the right where no Daycaptions are anymore. Because I habe no experience in Javascript I cannot find out which code is responsible for this behaviour.p  pMy questions arep  p1 Does anyone have had a similar problem with a DatePicker in Javascript and found a solution heshe could share p  p2 Does anyone know a different Javascript DatePicker Example that can be used without having to buy it p  pThe code has roughly 1200 lines of code so I will not post it here but it can be downloaded a hrefhttpsacrobatusers.comtutorialsbasicacroformstoolset relnofollowherea.p
Negative 1231 pI have some code for what I call an ImageRailView. Basically, this view should take an array of resources and place them inside a HorizontalScrollView containing a LinearLayout with androidorientationhorizontal. When displayed, the selected image is the one in the center. When scrolled all the way to either end the end point image should be centered. The selected image should be larger than any of the other images in the rail as well as have an alpha of 1.0. The images on either side of the selected image should be slightly larger than normal but smaller than the selected image and have an alpha of 0.8. The remaining images should be of their default sizes and have an alpha of 0.6.p  pThe odd thing Im seeing is that in my code for codemodifyStockAvatarImagecode I need to multiply the left and right

Not only that, but the generated passwords seem similar, for example N2Q5MjJkZWM, N2YzNGRkYWQp  pAnyone has an idea how I could generate a high entropy password, about 1620 chars in length and it must not generate similar passwords.p
