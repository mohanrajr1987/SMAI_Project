Positive 451 phope everyone is well.p  pI am getting this error when calling a method that Ive created. I reason why I created the method is to return 2 double values, so I used a 2d array. Here is my relevant code p  precodeDouble[][] type2FS type2FS  new Double[rule.getRules.getx.getAttributes.size][rule.getRules.getx.getAttributes.size] int pos0 codepre  pthe 2d array is the size of the number of attributes in a Decision Tree Rule, the rules are stored in an ArrayList.p  precodetype2FS[pos][pos]calRightgrade.getDM,grade.getDNU,grade.getDNL,Double.parseDoublestore.getData[i][z] pos break codepre  pI get the error in the part after the  sign, with the message Type mismatch cannot convert from Double[][] to Double.

So one set looks like 4.5,5.5, now one decision tree rule can have many sets depending on the rule. So I thought the best way to store this was in a 2D Array.p  pI cant understand where Iam going wrong.  Any help would be greatly appreciated.p  pThank youp

Positive 451 pGuysp  pIm developping an app from structure analysis in engineering and at some point I have to solve a system of equations. For that, Im using a simple gaussian elimination method that I put together quite quickly. Problem is, since Im dealing with a lot of fractions, sort of big and small numbers, and the matrices are relatively big 300x300 is not uncommon, theres a huge loss of accuracy in the results there are some cases when the loss reaches the second decimal algarism. Do you guys have some insight on that Do I have to use BigDecimal or something similarp  pPs. Im using matrices of doubles.p
Positive 451 pI understand the differences between floating point and double...I think but Im having issues with my code, and I have figured out the problem I just dont know how to fix it. So the assignment asks you to use a simple loop to add 0.01  0.020.03....10,000,000, once using floating point numbers with double precision, and a second time the correct way. My issue becomes when I add using a floating point number it basically maxes out at around 200,000 which I remember the teacher talking about but I dont remember him talking about a way around it. Also for some reason my output is in scientific notation and I cant seem to get it into fixed point notation with 2 digits.

Positive 451 pI have read in different post on stackoverflow and in the C documentation, that converting codelongcode or any other data type representing a number to codedoublecode loses precision. This is quite obvious due to the representation of floating point numbers.p  pMy question is, how big is the loss of precision if I convert a larger number to codedoublecode Do I have to expect differences larger than  X p  pThe reason I would like to know this, is that I have to deal with a continuous counter which is a codelongcode. This value is read by my application as codestringcode, needs to be cast and has to be divided by e.g. 10 or some other small number and is then processed further.p  pWould codedecimalcode be more appropriate for this task p

Negative 451 pIm wondering if its possible to sandbox JavaScript running in the browser to prevent access to features that are normally available to JavaScript code running in an HTML page.p  pFor example, lets say I want to provide a JavaScript API for end users to let them define event handlers to be run when interesting events happen, but I dont want those users to access the properties and functions of the codewindowcode object. Am I able to do this p  pIn the simplest case, lets say I want to prevent users calling codealertcode. A couple of approaches I can think of arep  ul liRedefine codewindow.alertcode globally. I dont think this would be a valid approach because other code running in the page i.e. stuff not authored by users in their event handlers might want to use codealertcode.li liSend the event handler code to the server to process. Im not sure that sending the code to the server to process is the right approach because the event handlers need to run in the context of the page. li ul  pPerhaps a solution where the server processes the user defined function and then generates a callback to be executed on the client would work Even if that approach works are there better ways to solve this problemp

Negative 451 pIm trying to create a feature that both creates a list template and an instance of that list using the codeltListTemplatecode and codeltListInstancecode elements. I would like for content approval to be turned on by default. According to the a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibraryms462947.aspx relnofollowdocs on ListTemplatea, setting the EnableModeration attribute to TRUE should do it.

Negative 451 pIm using the click event on the TreeView to do some stuff when a node is clicked in the TreeView. I do this by getting the node that is click on by calling GetNodeAt with the mouse coordinates, like thisp  precodeprivate void TreeViewClickobject sender, System.EventArgs e      MouseEventArgs mouseEventArgs  e as MouseEventArgs      if mouseEventArgs  null         return       Get the node that is being clicked.           TreeNode node  this.GetNodeAtmouseEventArgs.X, mouseEventArgs.Y       Do other stuff...  codepre  pHowever, the GetNodeAt method only works when the click is on the node label, when the node image is clicked then GetNodeAt returns null. This is a bit annoying since the node is actually selected when the image is clicked but I cant find out what node it is.p  pDo anyone have any suggestionsp  pUpdated Ive gotten some suggestions to use SelectedNode instead. I cant since its set after the Click event is fired. This actually in a control that inherits TreeView and what it does is fire its own Clicked event but with the underlying data that the TreeNode represents instead of the TreeNode itself.p  pUpdated Turns out that someone had overridden the GetNodeAt method in our code which introduced this behavior, which I didnt realize. So the question is null and void and there is no problem with the GetNodeAt method. Why someone would do this remains a mystery. p

Negative 451 pstrongScopestrongp  pI am trying to have my application arrange lines of some complex controls and split those lines into pages. Something like this img srchttpapreleva.comvmcontrolsinpages.png altalt textp  pMuch like a word processor would do, only there are complex controls instead of words. Note that the requirement of splitting into pages is essential. p  pAlso note that the obvious solution of inheriting from Panel and implementing MeasureOverrideArrangeOverride wouldnt do, because I would like very much to have pages as separate framework elements  this way, I would be able to do some nice things with them, like dragging them around, rotating, etc. I am thinking of this solution inheriting from Panel as of last resort, but Im sure there should be a better way.p  pstrongAdopted strategystrongp  pThis seems like something relatively simple, provided I know sizes of those controls. I use verticaloriented stackpanels for pages, and horizontaloriented ones for lines. I pack controls into line one by one until they exceed the lines width, and then create stackpanel for the next line and continue. When the next line doesnt fit into current page, I create next page, and the process goes on.p  pI expect the order of several hundred controls at once, so I figured this approach should do.p  pstrongThe problemstrongp  pThe problem is the very one I would expect from WinForms I do not know the size of those controls Turns out, if the control doesnt have Width and Height set explicitly, it will have DesiredSize of zero right after it is created.p  pThis problem can be solved by calling .Measure Size.Empty . After that, DesiredSize is calculated somewhat correctly.p  pI say somewhat  because it is still not entirely correct, unfortunately. The latest problem Ive found is with bindings to relative source. Consider the following XAMLp  precodeltItemsControl xClassMyClass xmlns...gt     ltItemsControl.ItemTemplategt         ltEllipse WidthDataBinding RelativeSourceRelativeSource FindAncestor, AncestorTypexType MyClass, PathEllipseWidth gt     ltItemsContro.ItemTemplategt ltItemsControlgt codepre  pWhere EllipseWidth is a property on MyClass, which is my custom ItemsControl descendant.p  pTurns out, a call to Measure causes the ItemsControl to create its items, but the binding doesnt get resolved. Check out the trace p  precode52  Created BindingExpression hash15030582 for Binding hash15006601 54    Path EllipseWidth 56  BindingExpression hash15030582 Default mode resolved to OneWay 57  BindingExpression hash15030582 Default update trigger resolved to PropertyChanged 58  BindingExpression hash15030582 Attach to Ellipse.Width hash12274123 62  BindingExpression hash15030582 RelativeSource FindAncestor requires tree context 61  BindingExpression hash15030582 Resolve source deferred codepre  pSpecifically, note the last two lines. What is a tree context and how do I provide it I tried to add the control to a live panel before calling Measure, but it didnt help much.p  pI must say that, according to the trace, the source does get resolved eventually, but thats too late I need to know the control size now.p  pstrongGeneralizing the problemstrongp  pEven if I resolve this binding problem, I cannot be sure that there wont be any others. So the ultimate question is emI need a clean as in supported way to know when a controls initialization is completely done, and the to find the size of a that controlemp  pOr another option maybe Im taking the wrong approach, and there is another, cleaner, way to do what Im trying to dop

Negative 451 pI am having an issue where I try to access the Lists.asmx web service in a remote or local site and am getting a 401 error. To be clear, this is vtibinLists.asmx. The setup is I have one WSS 3.0 site which connects via soap to the lists service of another, WSSMOSS site. On our stage environment these two sites are on the same box, but in dev theyre seperate. Whatever the situation, theyre all on the same domain. Originally prior to a rebuild the web service calls worked fine in dev, but not in stage, which while puzzling at least confirmed that my implementation of the web service is correct, and the issue is one of authorisation. Here is my initial Lists service setup codep  precodenew Lists       Url  Utility.AppSettingWSS.Url, true,      Credentials  new NetworkCredential                  UserName  Utility.AppSettingWSS.UserName, true,            Password  Utility.AppSettingWSS.Password, true,            Domain  Utility.AppSettingWSS.Domain, true        codepre  pWith me manually specifying the domain credentials of the full access account on the server.

This behavior makes sense, but I dont really know how to get around this.

Negative 451 pThe situation is thusp  pI have an application which provides editing capabilities to XML an file. This file follows a certain Schema. The Schema belongs to a subset of Schemas which actually follow a line of evolution from one to another  so they are not so different from one another.p  pThe main difference between the schemas is an enumeration of string labels.p  pI now have need to save meta data in XML format This is a second type of XML file. This meta data contains a list of labels from the set enumerated in the schema.p  pThe application can accept a new schema at runtime and adjust itself.p  pTherefore I have an XML file that must be validated by two schemas one static containing the basic structure of the meta data stored in the XML and one which contains the proper label enumeration.

Negative 451 pIn my gwt app, on some screens, I create a dialogbox with an input form. I would like to be able to use the tabindex property but only within that dialog box. ie cycles first to last field of that dialog box only Right now if I press tab when the last field is selected, the focus will move onto the first tab index that happens to be an item behind the dialog box set as glass. This is quite annoying as one now has to tab several times until the focus returns to the first dialog box field. Setting the dialog box to modal is even worse as as soon as you tab outside the dialog box, the tab key gets ignored since objects outside the dialog box no longer receive keyboard events cant tab out. Is my only option to listen for the tab key and handle tabbing manually I would be fine with tabbing going outside my app and onto the url bar for example as long as it returns to my dialog box without having to go through all the elements under it.p

Negative 451 pI have some scripts that I would like to run every time a user logs off. I would like to create something that programatically sets up the logoff scripts. For example, an exe or a cmd file that can be executed to add the logoff script to the list of logoff scripts that Windows executes. Because of this, a Windows API function or a Windows shell command would be preferable, but I can find no such functions or commands to help with this.p  pI checked on the registry edits that the local group policy editor makes when you use it to add a logoff script to group policy, but it does a lot of things that Im not sure I can mimic. For example, it makes a lot of registry edits, and it uses numeric codes in some of the registry keys and binary data in some of the values. I would not know what the values represent.p  pI have tried subsets of the changes that GPEdit does in the hopes that doing so would still work. For example, I exported the changes it made to HKCUSoftwarePoliciesMicrosoftWindowsSystemScriptsLogoff and imported them on another PC, but that did not work, and the GPEdit MMC was unaware that I had even made the change.p  pAs I said, a set of Windows API functions or a Windows shell command would be preferable if anyone knows of some that could help, but if anyone knows of a way to decode the heap of information that GPEdit makes in a way that I could mock it then Im not against making registry changes as long as they are stable.p  pWhatever the solution I find and use, it has to be able to be automatic and reliable, as it will be executed remotely against many computers with psexec, and it will also be included into automated setup processes for future PCs that are set up.p  pUnfortunately, this seems to be a difficult topic to Google for, as many other things people are trying to do have many of the same key words that I query for but are not actually the same topic. For example, shutdownlogoff hooks for running apps, or remotely logging off users.p  pIf anyone is a Windows registry or MMC wizard and thinks that seeing a dump of the registry changes that the GPEdit MMC makes when doing the same thing would be helpful then just say so, and Ill make that available since Ive already captured it. I doubt thats the way to go, however I have started looking into how to create MMC snapin tools my thought is that perhaps the GPEdit snapin itself can be reverse engineered so that I can see exactly what its doing in a simple way. This is not going anywhere fast though, as none of the .adm files I see appear to have the settings for this, and the gpedit.msc file doesnt appear to have anything that would give it away in the plaintext part, though there is a section in it that appears as gibberish, so maybe theres some sort of magic going on in there.p

Negative 451 pI was hoping for a little help. I am currently using some of the jQueryUI widgets in an ASP.Net Web App. I have successfully got everything working. Basically, I have a GridView on a page which contains some hidden fields in each row containing data. I also have a dialog div containing an update panel and a few Labels.p  pWhen a user clicks on an Image Button on the GridView, the jQuery is fired to show the jQueryUI dialog and code behind is used to fill the labels from the selected GridView row. Unfortunately, the AJAX communication takes quite a bit longer to update versus showing the dialog div.p  pThe same question actually applies to the loading of an ASP page into a jQuery popup window also as I will need to eventually do this. p  pSo my questions arep  ul liHow can I make jQuery wait to execute until after the partial postback has returned with the AJAX information for the popupli liIs the above method the right way to goli liIs there a better wayli liIs there a way to speed up AJAX communications to make it more instantaneousli ul  pThanks in advance for your input.p

Ideally, I should be able to tell the web service to bring back a specific page worth of data starting record number and number of rows, but how do I get the ListView or the DataPager to fire an event that asks for this datap  pHere is the ASPX codep  precode    ltaspListView IDlistPersons runatservergt     ltLayoutTemplategt         lttablegt             lttheadgt                 lttrgt                     ltthgt                         Site ID                     ltthgt                     ltthgt                         PersonID                     ltthgt                     ltthgt                         Person Name                     ltthgt             lttheadgt             lttbodygt                 ltaspPlaceHolder IDitemPlaceholder runatserver gt             lttbodygt         lttablegt         ltaspDataPager IDPager1 runatserver PagedControlIDlistPersons PageSize5 gt             ltFieldsgt                 ltaspNextPreviousPagerField ShowFirstPageButtontrue ShowPreviousPageButtontrue                     ShowNextPageButtonfalse ShowLastPageButtonfalse gt                 ltaspNumericPagerField gt                 ltaspNextPreviousPagerField ShowFirstPageButtonfalse ShowPreviousPageButtonfalse                     ShowNextPageButtontrue ShowLastPageButtontrue gt             ltFieldsgt         ltaspDataPagergt     ltLayoutTemplategt     ltItemTemplategt         lttrgt             lttdgt                 lt EvalSiteID gt             lttdgt             lttdgt                 lt EvalPersonID gt             lttdgt             lttdgt                 lt EvalPersonName gt             lttdgt         lttrgt     ltItemTemplategt     ltEmptyDataTemplategt         No data found...     ltEmptyDataTemplategt ltaspListViewgt codepre  pHeres the code behindp  precodeprivate void DoListstring Match      ContactsService cs  new ContactsService     listPersons.DataSource  cs.FindMatch, 100      listPersons.DataBind  codepre  pand the web serivicep  precode[WebMethod] public ListltPersongtFindstring Match, int Count      if Count lt 5 Count  5     using DataLayer.ContactsDataContext context  new ContactsDataContext              var Persons              from p in context.Persons             where p.PersonName.ContainsMatch             orderby p.LastName, p.FirstName             select new Person                              SiteID  p.SiteID,                 PersonID  p.PersonID,                 PersonName  p.PersonName,                      return Persons.TakeCount.ToList       codepre

Negative 451 pIts been baffling me how the AnyCPU feature in .NET works It loads the executable as native 32bit if the system is 32bit, and as 64bit if the system is 64bit which you can easily confirm with Task Manager.

But the .NET framework seems to install no such thing... Im at a complete loss at how the same executable can be native 32bit and 64bit at the same time, especially since a disassembly of mscoree.dll doesnt even show references to undocumented native functions.p  pDoes anyone have any knowledge andor reasonable guesses as to how this was done Its obviously possible so no saying things like its not possible, and it makes me want to try to write a emnativeem crossplatform EXE...p  hr  pEditp  pAs a side note, consider how you cant run 32bit executables in a 64bit Windows PE environment... theres emgotem to be some way to extend or modify the PE loader with some sort of plugin, rightp

Negative 451 pSeveral days ago my Google Chrome was updated to 12.0.742.53 beta, and Ive noticed very interesting change.br When opening a Youtube video page, page loading process does not end even when all the content text, images is loaded loading ends only when strongvideo bufferingstrong completes Also, when I interrupt the loading by pressing codeEsccode, for example video downloading is also stopped Until now I had to right click on the video and press emStop Downloadem to abort buffering. p  pIMHO thats a great user experience and a big step for making the Flashbased content behave like ordinary web content.p  pMy question is how this is done   p  pI thought theyre simulating some loading process until the buffering completes. Also they should have handled the codewindow.onAbortcode event or something, in order to tell the Flash to stop buffering.

It always follows the same structure, but some responses use different keys for the addresscomponents data structure.p  pFor Example, some searches result inp  precodeestablishment               gt location name streetnumber               gt address street number route                       gt the street name locality                    gt the city administrativearealevel1 gt the state postalcode                 gt zippostal code codepre  pwhereas, if i were to search a general area, such as Hampton Beach, NH i would receivep  precodesublocality                 gt beach name  area administrativearealevel3 gt citytown name administrativearealevel1 gt the state postalcode                 gt zippostal code codepre  pas you can see the two responses have their differences. Is there a known jquery library that can be used to handle these different responses to return a data set of the address components that can be used for a humanreadable wayp  pI will note that the response also returns a formattedaddress type, which returns it like Hampton Beach, NH 03842, USA  OR  Boston University, 1 University Rd, Boston, MA 022151407, USA As you can see, these too are pretty different. I could split by comma, but Id like to use the actual addresscomponents for a flawless database insert.p

Negative 451 pSo I have streaming video coming in, and I want to know when it is buffering.  This is fundamentally not that hard, just adding an EventListener for some type of buffering event, but I was wondering if this is necessarily the best way to do it.p  pMy other thought was setting up a timer that polls the video feed every X milliseconds asking it if the video isBuffering, or somesuch.

Negative 451 pMy program.cs calls the mdi parent frmMain. frmMain then opens different child forms based on user action. p  pAll the processing logic is written in BusinessLogic.cs. frmMain at load calls the methods of BusinessLogic.cs to initially populate the data. The child forms too call BusinessLogic to fetch data and process it. Id like to do all this through a BackGroundWorker ie the frmMain calls the say StartBGWorker method of BusinessLogic.cs and this method creates a backgroundworker for this specific call, calls the Dowork event, does the fetching amp processing and closes when done.p  pIm at a loss about how to create the instance and the events for backgroundworker. So how exactly do I use backgroundworker in a class file p  pEdit Maybe my logic is wrong and I should add a BGW to each form that calls BusinessLogig.cs. Then whenever I call a method of BusinessLogic I can do so through backgroundworker. Would this be a better implementationp  pEdit2 Feel a bit idiotic about my doubt now that I found a way. I just created a public static method with the initialize code of BGW in BusinessLogic. Now whenever I need to do processing I first call this method from my forms.

The derived classes are responsible for creating the codetypescode parameter, but they arent hardcoded anywhere. The types are based on the presence of attributes deep within the derived classs composition hierarchy.p  pIve trying to fix this with lazy loading delegates, but so far I havent come up with a clean solution.p  h2Updateh2  pThere are really two issues here, one is that the IoC container is passed to the controller, acting as a service locator. This is easy to removeyou can move the location up or down the call stack using all sorts of techniques.p  pThe second issue is the difficult one, how can you ensure that the controller has the necessary services when the requirements arent exposed until runtime. It should have been obvious from the start you cant You will always be dependent upon either the state of the service locator or contents of a collection. In this particular case no amount of fiddling will ever resolve the problem described in a hrefhttpblog.ploeh.dk20100203ServiceLocatorIsAnAntiPattern.aspxthis articlea with staticly typed dependencies. I think that what Im going to end up doing is passing a Lazy array into the controller constructor and throwing an exception if a required dependency is missing.p

While I can add logic such as if statements to check for null values, why cant I simply pass through null values and have them be ignored p  pMy problem revolves around a function which enters a book into my sql database for my app. If I enter all of the books information such as author, title, copyright, ISBN, etc. there is no problem as I am not supplying any null values. If however, I were to leave the copyright or ISBN as Null and try to pass these through to the function I get a nullpointerexception. Sometimes I dont need to record the ISBN or the copyright this is an example and not the real app so instead of making multiple functions such as addBook... addBookWithNoISBN... addBookWithNoCopyright... ... what is the better way to do this p  pI believe I should be sending all of my variables to the function as a string array and perhaps do some processing in the function itself Is there a better way p  pI hope people get what Im trying to say, thanks a lotp

On a second run, the global variable mystring has the previously acquired value, so it will go into the else condition. The question is How can I listen to a file finished loading event in JavaScript to prevent this behaviour Thank you very much.p

Negative 451 pI have a small personal project, which is supposed to collect data from different webshops. What I basically do, is run a cron script every night.

Every time the cron script runs, it saves new entries with price data for each product 300, even if the products price is unchanged. I know I can prevent saving unnecessary data with a check to see wether the price is changed or not. But then again a product can be taken out of stock, leaving me no information of when it went out of stock which it would if I saved the price each day. How would you guys do this more effective The cron script would potentially take a long time to execute because of the DOM parsing, and I want to be sure everything is parsed and added to database as expected.p

Negative 451 pI am hoping that someone can help shed some light on this issue Ive been struggling over for the last couple of days.  I have been using the AJAX Toolkit ModalPopupExtender outside of ListViews perfectly fine, but for some reason I cant seem to wrap my head around why this code is not working inside of a ListView item template.p  pBasically, what I am trying to achive is a user is presented with some rows of data via the ListView in which each row displays a LinkButton with the text Remove.  I want the user to be able to click on this link, and a modal dialog box pop up and ask them if they are sure they want  to do this.  If they click the okay button, it should fire off an event and do the necessary database work and reload the page... if not, cancel the postback request and clear the dialog box.p  pWith the code below, I have successuflly hooked into the link button via the targetid property of the ModalPopupExtender so the dialog emdoesem popup.  However, the okay button does not fire off the event Ive written Ive placed a breakpoint in the codebehind within the event, and it does not get touched.  Also, the cancel button does not work as it normally would outside of the listview control.  p  pI must be missing something fairly fundamental here, but Im at a loss  any help would greatly be appreciated.  Im certainly open to alternative methods if this just isnt viable.p  precodeltItemTemplategt         lttrgt             lttd aligncentergt                 ltaspLabel runatserver IDlblUserID Textlt EvalUSERID gt Visiblefalse gt                 ltaspLinkButton runatserver IDlnkRemoveUser TextRemove gt                   ltaspPanel IDremoveUserModalPanel runatservergt                     ltdiv classpopupgt                         ltdiv classloginTitleBar idDiv1gt                             Remove User                         ltdivgt                         ltdiv classpopupBodygt                             ltpgt                                 Are you sure you want to remove this user                             ltpgt                         ltdivgt                         ltdiv classpopupControlsgt                             ltaspButton idbtnRemoveUserOkay runatserver typebutton TextRemove User                                  onclickbtnRemoveUserOkayClick gt                             ltinput idbtnRemoveUserCancel typebutton valueCancel gt                         ltdivgt                     ltdivgt                 ltaspPanelgt                  ltaspModalPopupExtender                      IDremoveUserModalPopupExtender                      runatserver                     BackgroundCssClassModalPopupBG                     CancelControlIDbtnRemoveUserCancel                     TargetControlIDlnkRemoveUser                     PopupControlIDremoveUserModalPanel                     dragfalse gt                 ltaspModalPopupExtendergt             lttdgt             lttdgt                 ltaspLinkButton IDlnkUserName runatserver Textlt EvalUSERNAME gt gt             lttdgt             lttdgt                 ltaspLabel IDlblFirstName runatserver Textlt EvalFIRSTNAME gt gt             lttdgt             lttdgt                 ltaspLabel IDlblLastName runatserver Textlt EvalLASTNAME gt gt             lttdgt             lttdgt                 ltaspLabel IDlblEmailAddress runatserver Textlt EvalEMAILADDRESS gt gt             lttdgt         lttrgt     ltItemTemplategt codepre

The framework has standard converters for all of the basic types Long, Byte, Integer, Short, Character, Double, Float, BigDecimal, BigInteger and Boolean.. For example, if your component is associated with a property of type boolean, JSF will choose the Boolean converter. Primitive types are automatically converted to their object counterparts. p  phowever when I execute the above code, I got this errorp  precodejidt78 99999999999 must be a number consisting of one or more digits. codepre  pWhat is wrong with my understanding this concept Why doesnt JSF uses its standard converters in this casep

Negative 451 pI am utilizing Codeigniter.p  pI have developed a variety of features, and they work perfectly if used as intended.p  pOne such script, a whois script checks the owner of a domain name. If however the user types in an invalid domain name, all sorts of errors are being thrown up here there and everywhere.p  pFor example, if a user types in stack.com, this is of course not a valid domain. Thus when i call my helper which does the query, no result is return and a variety of errors are returned. There are also errors when i try to display an empty array to the user.p  pMy question relates to errors.p  pI could use pregmatch and check if the domain is valid. If not i set an error variable which i intend to output to the user.p  pHowever before my controller gets to the if else statement which decides whether to show the error page or the results page, the program is running queries, and accessing methods to get the data which were there no errors would get the data to pass to the result view.p  pI.E I know there is an error, but still lots of other errors are being shown because an invalid item is being passed to my other scripts.p  pWith Codeigniter, and the MVC setup, what is the best way of catching the error and displaying it to the user without having to use exceptions which do the same thing over and over againp  pThanksp  pEDIT WITH IDEAp  precodetry  thisgtloadgtmodelwhois thisgtwhoisgtprocessdomain.com  catch  thisgtloadgtviewerrors,errordata thisgtloadgtviewfooter die   thisgtloadgtviewnormalcontent thisgtloadgtviewfooter codepre  pIs this the suggested setup for using exceptions with codeigniter within my model, the function will throw exceptions if there is a problem.

Negative 451 pWhat I have been able to grasp from reading the source and documentation from several PHP frameworks is that they generally dont persist, except for what you personally cache or throw into a SESSION var. Why is this It seems a waste to essentially initialize the framework for every single request, would it not be better to at least serialize and store some core objects and variables to save processing and time br br At first I thought this was rather subjective and avoided asking, but everything Ive read doesnt really speak about it at all, so there must be something obvious Im missing.br br  The only real mentiondiscussion Ive found of this is a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions2940610howtopersistobjectsbetweenrequestsinphpherea which doesnt directly answer my question and some of which goes over my head a little.p  pEdit for Clarification I am not asking about the inner workings of PHP, I know how persistence works ie wont persist unless you make it through caching or session vars, I am asking why PHP frameworks dont do this for their core objects.

Negative 451 pThe project that Im working on could benefit from having the possibility to easily swap between different big number libraries GMP, OpenSSL, etc. My current implementation defines a template abstract base class in which I implement all the required operators just to have some syntactic sugar and I define the required pure virtual functions.p  pFor each library, I have a derived class like this codeclass BigNumberGmp  public BigNumberBaseltBigNumberGmpgtcode. I know it kinda breaks OOP, but the C covariance functionality is too restrictive and it does not allow me to return BigNumberBase objects from methods, only references, which is quite undesirable...p  pThe problem is that I want the code that uses my custom wrappers to be able to work with any such wrapper BigNumberGmp, BigNumberOpenSsl, etc. In order to achieve this, I defined typedef BigNumberGmp BigNumber and put it inside some conditional macros, like sop  precodeif definedLIBGMP     typedef BigNumberGmp BigNumber endif codepre  pAlso, I include the appropriate headers in a similar fashion. This implementation requires that I define the LIBGMP symbol in the compiler options.p  pAs you can see, this is a rather hackish technique, that Im not really proud of. Also, it does not hide in any way the specialized classes BigNumberGmp, BigNumberOpenSsl, etc. I could also define the BigNumber class multiple times, wrapped in LIBXXX conditional macros or I could implement the required methods inside the BigNumber class multiple times, for each library, also wrapped in the LIBXXX conditional macros. These two latter ideas seem even worse than the typedef implementation and they will surely mess up the doxygen output, since it will not be able to figure out why I have multiple items with the same name. I want to avoid using the doxygen preprocessor, since I still depend on the LIBXXX defines...p  pIs there an elegant design pattern that I could use instead How would you approach such a problemp
Negative 451 pIm running in to some real speed issues with PHPUnitDBUnit. Anything that extends codePHPUnitExtensionsDatabaseTestCasecode takes forever to run. With 189 tests, the suite takes around 89 minutes. I was kind of hoping it would take 30 seconds at most p  pIt looks like restoring the database to its initial state is the process that takes the time, so weve made our datasets as small as possible and limit the number of tables we require for each test case. I am using fixtures and sharing as much as possible.p  pAre there any settings or modifications I can use to speed the execution up Looking at what the MySQL server is doing throughout the tests it seems that lots of truncateinserting is happening, but surely it would be faster to pack the test data sets into temporary tables and then simply select into them for each testp  pThe driver Im using is PDOMySQL with an XML test dataset.p

The User Agent is exactly the same, but now IsMobileDevice is True. However, when I uploaded to Azure it is still not detected as a mobile.p  pThroughout all this, there are no errors, just the above behavior. I have experienced exactly the same issue on 2 machines now with multiple different projects. In all cases, the user agent is being detected correctly, it is just the value of IsMobileDevice which changes.p  pI have tried deploying to Azure with just the MVC4 assemblies in bin deployable assemblies, and I have also tried bootstrapping the .net 4.5 installer on the package but this has made no difference.p  pI know that I can override the DisplayMode to hack a fix, but this doesnt help me if I want to use the MVC ViewSwitcher and doesnt really solve the problem.p  pSome help would be greatly appreciated as I have run out of ideas.p

The attacker would not know how many times the codeforcode loop is repeated and I would also store the cookies in a separate table to do some extra security checks e.g. user agent.p  pAlso, how many loops should I be prepared to do in order for this to be safe enough strongwithout making my site an easy target for DDOS attacksstrongp

Negative 451 pIm using a code that looks like thatp  precodeimg.loadfunction      do some stuff     this.width   codepre  pIn my callback the image size is always 0. It might have something to do with it but my images are locally loaded.p  pBut in truth, if I do this.width, I will get the expected width and then I can do some kind of computation from here to change my extjs window.p  pAfter some tries, I realize that if I do this all the attributes I changes dont seem to have any effect at all. p  pdoing codethis.width40code wont change the width of my image but doing codethis.width  40code will change the width of my image. Its as if doing codethiscode was copying my HTMLImageElement within a new element and those change would be applied only if I added to the dom again to replace the old one. p  pIm not so sure to understand whats going on there.p  pstrongEditstrongp  pThis is what my codeimgcode variable contains.p  precodeimg  ltimggt img.attrsrc, ....image codepre  pstrongEdit 2strongp  pThis doesnt really change the fact that jQuery doesnt handle image size for in memory images but I felt it would be good for anyone using Extjs to not repeat my error. One of the big problem in my case is that the codeimgcode object I used was a valid object but since Im using ExtJs, I inadvertently made a stupid mistake. I created my window that way...p  precodeExt.createExt.Window,     some settings   items [       html img.wrapltdivgt.parent.html,    etc codepre  pIn other word, the event I created was on img, but I never really added codeimgcode to the DOM. ExtJs added html text to the DOM which created a new object which cant be modified through event and so on. p  pSo I do have to create an id to find the new element and all of this has to be done after a call to codemodalWindow.showcode is done. After that everything works perfectly.p  pFor resizing the window, if the dimensions are set, you can set them back to codenullcode and do a doLayout call on the window and it will recalculate windowsize. p

Negative 451 pIm running into a performance problem with a strange behaviour of javascript inside my Firefox 13.0.1. The newest Chrome shows the same behaviour.p  pWhen I execute my javascript code which looks like the code snippet below, the result is pretty slow. However, I get about 10 x speedup if I simply inline the content of the outer loop over j. For my example application, this means that Im simply writing it two times for fixed values of j0 and j1 respectively, as m equals 2. Of course, I dont want m to be hardcoded, so Im asking myself what exactly causes this slowdown when using a real loopp  pDoes anybody have an ideap  pIm running the code inside a web worker.

By this I mean it is not something one can easily instantiate on the fly. I need to somehow unit test someMethod, but I cannot so simply create an X object to put in as parameters. p  pSo I first think to try and mock the object, but the problem I run in to is the someMethod function calls many methods of anObject, meaning this X object that is being mocked has a latge amount of functions that need to be called, and thus need to be mockexpected.

Negative 451 pIve come across a problem to which the simplest solution would be to extend the length of a UIGestureRecognizer. What I mean is that I need the iOS device to still believe the user has their finger on the screen for about 0.1 seconds after they release it. I need the device to think that the finger is in the exact same position for the 0.1 seconds as it was when the user released this. Any help as to weather this is possible would be greatly appreciated Thank youp  pEDIT Sorry for the late reply, Ive been really busy with work.p  pTo elaborate, Im using a set of classes made by Alan Quartermain called AQGridView. Its a class that strongly resembles UITableView however, it displays data in a grid instead of a list. There appears to be a bug where if I understand correctly, and I may very well not the data of the grid is reloaded before the delegate method, that is called when a user ends a UIGestureRecognizer, finishes if the user releases their finger while dragging a cell from one grid index to another very quickly. This causes a graphical glitch which can be recreated in the springboard example that comes with the class set where the dragging cell appears to settle one cell before or after its appropriate location, and then quickly jumps to its proper location. I believe this is because there is a brief period, when the user releases their finger, where the grids count is 1 of what it is when the cell settles. This is a poor explanation of the problem, but the best I could come up with. As well, Im a relatively new developer and could be way off on the cause of the problem. That is why I believe the most appropriate fix would be to extend the gesture length by a very small amount. If anyone wants to take a look at the AQGridView classes httpsgithub.comAlanQuatermainAQGridView I would really appreciate it But if possible a simpler fix would just be to simulate the touch that the user inputed right before they released their finger so that the desired animation occurs.p

But how do I change the above code to restrict the movement to vertical and horizontal movement only so that the enemies movement staircases its way along a diagonal path, taking the manhattan distance I think its called. As shown by my crude drawing below... S being the start point F being the finish and the numbers being each intermediate point along its path to create a staircase type diagonal movement.

Negative 451 pIm a newbie mobile programmer with an idea for a mobile mapping form.  I have plenty of experience programming other webbased apps, but havent done anything mobile yet.  Without going into exhaustive detail about the app, I was hoping to get some responses to the general questions below.  I would prefer to develop with HTML5, CSS amp Javascript to ease deployment on multiple platforms, but am open to developing in other environments to achieve the results I need.p  ol lipI need to have the ability to create spatial data, both by GPS collection and by drawing on screen over maps, and the ability to export for use in other desktop GIS programs.  I know this is possible based on other apps that already do it, but Im unsure how they are accomplishing it.  I presume they are simply logging location points and having those points written to an XML file.  Is this correct  Does anyone know of any documentation online that I could be directed to If its simply a KML that is being created on the mobile device, I believe exporting would be fairly easy by translating to CSV and importing to other programs.  pli lipRegarding data collectioncreation, I also need the ability to collectcreate while offline.  I believe I can use something like the Bad Elf GPS for offline data collection www.badelf.com, so my question is more in regards to storage.  If creating data offline, can it be stored locally on the mobile device using sqlLite and then exported to a SQL database when back online  If so, would this allow me to view the data Im creating live onscreen as it is being createdpli ol  pLastly, any thoughts on developing in HTML5CSSJavascript  Ive considered using Flash Builder as well, but dont own the current copy 4.6 yet, still on 4.0.p  pIf anyone knows of any online documentation that would give me some insight into mobile data collectioncreation it would be greatly helpful.p  pThanks in advance to the responses.p  pZachp

Negative 451 pI have a complex model, and want to create different screens for editing it.  As a silly example, say its a user model, and one screen lets you edit the name, another screen edits the phone number, and another page edits the users preferences.p  pIts easy enough to create new actions, forms for each view, routes, and so on, but the trick is when you actually hit submit, it calls codeupdatecode, and ... then what  If there are errors, it should go back to the page being used to edit the model, not the generic edit view.  Even on success, it might be nice to go back to the page that update was called from.p  pHacking something up with the session would not be difficult at all, but I always wonder is there a better way.p

Negative 451 pI was just going through an article which explains about Wild pointers. For garbage memory, it states that when a pointer pointing to a memory object is lost, i.e. it indicates that the memory item continues to exits, but the pointer to it is lost it happens when memory is not released explicitly.

Negative 451 pstrongContextstrong  p  pIve often been in situations where our ASP.NET pages would have to show data to the user on a GridView, let him change it as he pleases Textbox on cells and only save it to the database when he actually hits the Save Button. This data is usually a virtual state of the information on the page, meaning that the user can change everything without really saving it until he hits the Save Button. In those cases, theres always list of data that needs to be persisted across ASP.NET Postbacks. This data could be an instance of a codeDataTablecode or just some codeListltSomeclassgtcode. p  pI often see people implementing this and persisting the data on codeSessioncode. On that cases i also usually see problems when it comes to some user navigating with multiple tabs open, some times on the same page. Where the data of two different tabs would get merged and cause problems of information being scrambled.p  pExample of how Session is often usedp  precodeprivate ListltSomeClassgt DataList      get              return Session[SomeKey] as ListltSomeClassgt          set               Session[SomeKey]  value       codepre  pPeople often tries to solve it by doing something like thisp  precodeprotected void PageLoadobject sender, EventArgs e      if IsPostBack              DataList  null          else              FillGridViewDataList       codepre  pBut what about when two tabs are already loaded and the user is changing the GridView values and for some weird reason he tries to save the data by hitting the Save button on the other page I personally dislike this option.p  pOther ways to do this would be to put the data on codeViewStatecode. However, when it comes to persisting substantially big lists, it could impact the page heavily when its stored on the page codeHiddenFieldcode.p  pBut, whats the best way to make that work Once, i thought in using codeSessioncode together with codeViewStatecode where the codeViewStatecode would hold an unique identifier which would index the codeSessioncode saved data. That would prevent sharing the data between tabs on the browserp  precodeprivate ListltSomeClassgt DataList      get              if ViewState[SomeKey]  null                      ViewState[SomeKey]  Guid.NewGuid.ToString                   return Session[ViewState[SomeKey].ToString] as ListltSomeClassgt          set           if ViewState[SomeKey]  null                      ViewState[SomeKey]  Guid.NewGuid.ToString                   Session[ViewState[SomeKey].ToString]  value       codepre  pOn the other hand it would store a new list of data to the Session every time the user enters the page. Which would impact the server memory. Maybe they could be erased in some way.p  pstrongQuestionstrong p  pWhat would be the best way of persisting that kind of data across Postbacks, considering the contexts of multiple tabs on the browser, with the less cost to the server and to the maintenance coding teamp  pstrongUpdatestrongp  pAs nunespascal nicely posted, one option would be to store the codeViewStatecode in the codeSessioncode using the codeSessionPageStatePersistercode. But unfortunately thats not an option on my case. And yet it is not very different from my last example, saving the data on the Session indexed by an UniqueId stored on the ViewState.p  pWould there be any other optionsp

Negative 451 pJust a quick question about form. p  pI am logging various error messages and am wondering if I should create a new string for the message within the log call, or create a constant string within an interface I am using to store other string constants, and then just reference that.  I was using a code analyzer code and it alluded to the latter saying it was better practice to create a string constant and reference it, even if it the string is only used once.  I am just wondering if this is indeed the casep  pThanks in advancep

Negative 451 pIn ModX, Im trying to make a simple redirect based on which page the user is on. On my site, I have a chunk with various links to pages such as About Us, Careers, etc. This chuck is used on all pages on the site. p  pMy issue starts here  within the Careers page, there is a link to a new page which contains all available job postings. I would like to make it so that when the user is on the Careers page, clicking the link to the Careers page on the chunk will take them directly to the job posting page, rather than looping them right back to the Careers page.p  pThe url to the careers page is in this formatp  precodewww.example.comindex.phpqcareers.html codepre  pSo, my code in the chunk for if the user is on the Careers page, redirect to job listingsp  precodeltphp     if SERVER[PHPSELF]  index.phpqcareers.html        echo ltpgtlta hrefwww.joblistsite.comgtCareersltagtltpgt           else        echo ltpgtlta hrefindex.phpqcareers.htmlgtCareersltagtltpgt      gt codepre  pBut this doesnt work. It continues to link back to the Careers page instead of the job listings page. Ive tried using the pages ID, but that doesnt either. What should I use for the strongifstrong statement to get the current page in ModX What am I doing wrongp

But no images is displayed.  Rather than torture you with more XAML that does not work, perhaps I could ask someone to point me to some codeexamplesdocs that show how to bind a list of Images to a ListView or another control if you really feel that ListView is inappropriate.  Notice that my collection is the stuff Im binding to.  I notice that with many examples, they are binding to a subproperty.  I.e. they may have a collection of albums and for each album they bind to its property image see a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions2570568showingitemsasimagesinawpflistviewShowing items as images in a WPF ListViewa.  p  pAny ideas or help would be much appreciated.p  pDavep  pAdditional info. Based on suggestions by Clemens  I now have this code for PlayerCardImagesp  precodepublic ObservableCollectionltImageSourcegt PlayerCardImages              get                      var results  new ObservableCollectionltImageSourcegt              if PlayerCards.Count  0                 return results             else                              results.Addnew BitmapImagenew UriImages  diamond1.png, UriKind.Relative                          foreach var card in PlayerCards                               results.Addnew BitmapImagenew UriImages  GetCardFileNamecard, UriKind.Relative                            return results           codepre  pI used the exact XAML he suggested.  It almost works.  I say almost because I noticed strange behavior whereby sometimes 1 card would show and sometimes not I never got 2 cards.  All the getting cards from files and binding seems to be working and I tracked down what I think is key to the last remaining bug and its BIZARRE.  If in the debugger, I examine results, and further open up results[0] in the debugger, I get that card displayed  I actually have to open up [0] you see info about height, width, etc. for this to work.  Furthermore if I open up [1], I get that card displayed instead.  Why would opening up the debugger info have any effect  For those of you who might ask, what happens if you open up both cards in the debugger... that doesnt work.  I get a operation timed out exception.  I will say that perhaps my image files are big.  10Kbytes to 30 Kbytes.  Is that the problem Im guessing not, and that its a subtle problem with reading in the images or binding.  What is going on Thanks, Davep

Negative 451 pThis question is for fun I dont expect the answer to be useful.p  pWhen I see people doing things with codereducecode in Python, they often take advantage of a builtin function in Python, often from the codeoperatorcode module.p  pThis worksp  precoderesult  reducelambda a, b a  b, range5 codepre  pBut usually you would see thisp  precodefrom operator import add result  reduceadd, range5 codepre  pWhats strange to me is that the codeoperatorcode module doesnt seem to have a function for logical codeandcode.  It does have embitwiseem and, but not logical codeandcode.p  pSo suppose you are doing thisp  precoderesult  reducelambda a, b a and b, range1, 6 codepre  pIs there a builtin function that can be used herep  pIm also wondering if there is a builtin function that can replace codeorcode.p  pIf you map the arguments to Booleans first, you can use the bitwise and from codeoperatorcode, or just directly use codebool.andcode, like sop  precodefrom operator import and result  reduceand, mapbool, range1, 6 result  reducebool.and, mapbool, range1, 6 codepre  pAnd likewise with codeoperator.orcode or codebool.orcode for the codeorcode operation.  But I am looking for a function that doesnt need the values mapped to Booleans.p  pIf you knew for certain that your values are all integers, you could use codeoperator.mulcode for codeandcode and codeoperator.addcode for codeorcode.  This would be a crude hack and I dont want this answer... especially considering how expensive the multiplications would get if many numbers were encountered and none of them were zerop  pNote I am aware of codeallcode and codeanycode, which are better replacements for this use of codereducecode.  As I said at the top, Im asking this for fun.p  pNote A function that has the sideeffect of forcing all values to codeboolcode would be an acceptable answer.  The builtin codeandcode keyword doesnt do thisp  precodex  3 and 5   sets x to 5, not to True codepre  pBut for the purpose of this question I am just interested in a function that can work with codereducecode to do logical codeandcode or codeorcode operations.p

Negative 451 pI want a single javascript file to be cached for 1 hr and use the below code to achieve that. For some reasonmay be because that js file is loaded asynchronously the functions in that js file do not execute in IE8 when the js file is in cache. So I want to cache the js file in all the browsers except IE. Can I set a header so that the js file does not cache only for IE browsersp  precodetry           response.setHeaderCacheControl, maxageAIMConstants.CACHECONTROLTIMEPERIOD          catch Exception e          logger.infoError in setting the cache control         e.printStackTrace          codepre  pNote The js file is being loaded multiple times on the page via getScript call. So if I apply a conditional logic only for IE to fetch that js file by appending a variable to the file, the file may be loaded multiple times which is why Im not adding a random variable on the client side to fetch a new copy of the javascript file. I want to resolve this using the header directives. Any other solution involving javascript is also welcome.p  pUPDATE I added Vary to prevent caching of the js file and when I do that all the browsers take a new copy of js file. I want only IE to retrieve a new copy of js file everytime. All other browsers can cache the js file.p

Negative 451 pOkay so Im making a theme for tumblr. Im using isotope for layout options. What I want is for there to be two choices  one column with wide posts filling the entire div the posts will be in, and the other is a masonry layout with i think i set 3 columns. I also am using isotope to make filters so that people can narrow down what they see by post type. p  pnote this is a very basic skeleton copy of the theme, just so i can figure out the javascriptjquery first without too much clutter in my way. i will be adding other divs and sections in once i figure this out, making sure to leave this alone and work around it all. below is a copy of the html for the page thus far. i have been creating it in dreamweaver and then copy pasting it into tumblr, where the tags are rendered into actual posts. to see this page as it is intended, go to a hrefhttpdrmstxtesting.tumblr.com relnofollowhttpdrmstxtesting.tumblr.coma and i have only 2 or 3 posts in there, but its enough to give you the idea.p  pwhat im frustrated with is that clicking on the links for grid or one column works maybe once and then nothing happens, OR the only thing that is changing is the layout, not the css that makes the size of the posts bigger and smaller as i change layouts. also, i want it to look smooth, for example at one point i got it kind of working with some glitches and all the content would minimize to nothing and then flashcut right to the correct layout. i want people to see the post move to its spot and just shrink or grow a little, thats all. if you can help me with this, i know this is probably confusing especially with the tumblr code tags in there. id take them out, but i think that the way tumblr renders it is actually changing how it behaves so i kind of need it in there ... if you need clarification, let me know.p  pto make this a little easier, look for these classes and parts of the code  .box  .grid  .onecolumn  end of css, the javascript section, and the beginning of the body      p  precode    ltstyle

Negative 451 pIm performing POS tagging with the a hrefhttpnlp.stanford.edusoftwaretagger.shtml relnofollowStanford POS Taggera. The tagger only returns one possible tagging for the input sentence. For instance, when provided with the input sentence The clown weeps., the POS tagger produces the erroneous TheDT clownNN weepsNNS ...p  pHowever, my application will try to parse the result, and may reject a POS tagging because there is no way to parse it. Hence, in this example, it would reject TheDT clownNN weepsNNS .. but would accept TheDT clownNN weepsVBZ .. which I assume is a lowerconfidence tagging for the parser.p  pI would therefore like the POS tagger to provide multiple hypotheses for the tagging of each word, annotated by some kind of confidence value. In this way, my application could choose the POS tagging with highest confidence that achieves a valid parsing for its purposes.p  pI have found no way to ask the Stanford POS Tagger to produce multiple nbest tagging hypotheses for each word or even for the whole sentence. Is there a way to do this Alternatively, I am also OK with using another POS tagger with comparable performance that would have support for this.p

However I did implement this hook and this didnt change the behavior. p  pUPDATE I have the Path module installed from core and I declared some url aliases in the clean url section. Maybe this gives a conflictp  pUPDATE2 cleaning the cache didnt do the trick either.p  pUPDATE3 I also tries doing the url rewriting in the htaccess file.

Negative 451 pIm thinking about using the jQuery Ajax load method. In some cases, the html I want to load is quite large. Im wondering if the browser already streamlines the process behind the scenes, or should I minify andor compress the html before calling .load from jQuery If so, which one or both Is there a standard way to perform minification andor compressing in this scenariop  h2UPDATEh2  pDoes this make any sensep  pThe data Im going to retrieve from the server is static. Lets say I have data for apples, oranges, kumquats, and papayas, and none of it changes on the fly only when I update the site.p  pSo is it preferable that I get the data as Json via jQuery this wayp  precode.getJsonkumquats codepre  p...and then, of course, process the results that come back... OR ...simply send back the html with no need of massaging, as kumquats will always send back the exact same html, oranges will always be the same html, etc.p  pIn the latter option, then, I would do something like this jQuery pseudocode insteadp  precodeMainContent.html.loadContentKumquat.htm codepre  pIn summation, I can send all the html fullyformed across the wire, and clog up the pipes with some extra bits for a bit, OR I can send a less verbose representation of the datta json, and then massage it in the .getJson callback function, transforming it into html. Performancewise, does it make much difference BTW, this is not sensitive data  it doesnt matter who sees it as it zips by through the ether.p

Negative 451 pI have an synchronous execution path which needs to either complete or timeout within a given time frame. Lets say I have a class with main method in which I invoke methods A which inturn calls B and that inturn calls C of same or different classes.....all synchronous without using an external resource like database , webservice or file system where each of them could be timed out independently using a TxManager or respective timeout apis. So its more like a CPU or memory intensive computation. How do I code for its timeout in Java p  pI have looked at TimerTask but that more of making the flow async and for scheduling tasks.

Negative 451 pIm new to RabbitMQ and Im wondering how to implement the following producer creates tasks for multiple sites, theres a bunch of consumers that should process these tasks one by one, but only talking to 1 site with concurrency of 1, without starting a new task for this site before the previous one ended. This way slow site would be processed slowly, and the fast ones  fast as opposed by slow sites taking up all the worker capacity.p  pIdeally a site would be processed only by one worker at a time, being replaced by another worker if it dies. This seems like a task for exclusive queues, but apparently theres no easy way to list and subscribe to new queues. What is the proper way to achieve such results with RabbitMQp

Negative 451 pSorry to bother you with this how to. You see... for the past 2 days ive been looking nn SO and google for a way to get the result from a url into a variabel for my android wanna be app . Of course i found a few.

Well for me feels like is same thing from 1 methodp  precodeInputStream in  new URL httplocalhostweather.xml .openStream codepre  pand from another methodp  precodeReader r  new InputStreamReadercon.getInputStream codepre  pand there were a few more...they all crashed around this kind of thing. How do i know they crash here well i just remove the rest of lines from my function and test it again and again until the function didnt crash my app.p  pso my problem is how can i get a web page xml into a string without crashing my app.p  pIn case you wonder why i dont use some XML objectsmethods whatever you call it well simple...none of them worked also. Couldnt even compile most of them.p  pOh yeah...im new to androidjava...in fact i dont even have a android device..yet  but i preffer to do something with my time than just playing games.p  pin case u gonna say its the urlweb page fault well im using my webserver to test this. so the urlpage is ok. working.p  pPlease try to avoid blaming my stupidity. im asking because i dont know...it should be obvious that im not smart. ill be happy with a function that gets a string the url and returns the entire webpage into a stringp

If I go into admin modulespositions select CMS block, I can remove this hook from the footer area by typing orderdetail in the exceptions field.p  pBut then the error message is replaced by another error message for another hook and if I remove that aswell, it goes on and on. It is not practical edit every module position and add orderdetail as an exception. p  pThere must be a proper way of doing this so that prestashop can ignore the smarty layout and all positional module hooks and send out pure csv represented by emorderdetailcsv.tplem above.p

Negative 451 pI have a RelativeLayout container with 5 Buttons on it. p  pWhen I use a TranslationAnimation from offscreen below the screen, the buttons are blank until the animation is done. At the end of the animation, I explicitly draw the buttons and they appear in the correct locations.p  pI also have a similar container and buttons that I animated onscreen from the right offscreen. This container shows all of the buttons during the animation and after as I expect it to.p  pAlso, when I animate the first set of buttons down to their offscreen location below, they are visible during the entire animation.p  pThe problem only happens when animating from below the screen to onscreen.p

Negative 451 pI am adding to a list of elements through an ajax call.  The ajax call sends information to controller, controller adds everything to database, then grabs all the items for the list from the database, adds the items to a view model, then returns a partial view with the model.  I clear the div container for the list then add the returning HTML. p  precodecontainer.empty.htmlresult codepre  pMy problem is, in the HTML, I have Kendo Datepickers.  The page loads fine, and if I do a refresh everything is fine.  But right after the Ajax call, the Kendo Datepickers are not there.

Negative 451 pWe were recently tasked with a tech update, moving a Java based web application running in Apache Tomcat from a Windows 2003 Server to a Windows 2012 server. The IIS8 is passing requests to the Tomcat through Isapiredirect.dll. The new setup seems to be working, as I can browse to the website successfully.p  pHowever, one news page contains a lot of entries. With the old system, the page was displayed immediately and page content was delivered continously you could see the scroll bar in the browser get shorter. With the new system, the page is only displayed in the browser once it is complete you enter the url in the browser and hit return, nothing happens for a while and then the page is rendered completely with already the short scrollbar. Calling the same page locally on the server over port 8080 I see the old behaviour page displayed immediately and scrollbar gets shorter while page finishes loading.p  pI searched and found several articles about Response Buffering which seems to be for ASP pages only, and Output Caching.p  pUsing IIS manager, I navigated to the application pool for the web app, and in the section Output Caching I disabled both feature settings Enable Cache and Enable kernel cache. I also added a cache rule for the extension  which should fit all urls...the web application uses both urls with .jsp ending, and servlet names like display, and policy Prevent all caching for both kernel mode and user mode.p  pI then restarted the application pool, did an iisreset, also restarted the Tomcat service. However, theres no change, the behaviour is still the same.p  pSo I just dont know if I did something wrong here, or if Im just looking at the wrong configuration element. Any help would be welcome.p

Negative 451 pI have a style that Im trying to implement for a module on a web page, but am unsure what heading level the elements should be. The styles that Im implementing suggest that the heading levels should be like thisp  precodelth4gt[persons name]lth4gt  ltpgt[persons job title]ltpgt  lth3gt[summary of something the person did]lth3gt codepre  pThe summary of the person should be in the largest text, according to the styles, and the persons name should be slightly smaller. I know that heading level should not be used to dictate styles, so my instinct is to put the persons name in a h3 and the summary in an h4, but then Ill have to restructure the styles just to fit this little module.p  pIs making an exception in the styles better, or is there some allowance to the heading levels rule that would allow me to place an h4 above an h3 in the page hierarchyp

To provide more context, let me explain my idea. The form is divided in sections and each section will have a Next button. When the Next button is clicked, the section is validated with the clientside code that ASP.NET includes. If the section is valid, a jquery method will hide the section and show the next one. When the user reaches the last section of the form, a Submit button will be available and this button will fire the event to post the form to the server. p  pAny help or idea will be much appreciated.p  pThank you.p

Its better do with 1024px for example Or 960px is better And if I do with percentage for example, instead 960px use 70 Ill resolve the white space, right This is correct to dop  pSecond, to my site be responsive I was searching information and I was studying about media queries, but if I use percentage, I dont need to use the media queries, because the site is already responsive, right, or not Sorry to bother with this question that may seem simple but I am a beginner and I have this doubt, and maybe with your exprience, you can help me understand better.p

Negative 451 pI have a ASP.NET 4.5 web app built using VS 2013. When I set debug to false in the web.config file, my aspx pages throw 404s in production IIS 8.5.

I then went ahead and added the Nuget packages and other settings that my other app had until I hit it. Its the FriendlyUrls.p  pAfter adding the FriendlyUrls package, it still worked OK. It wasnt until after I actually emenabledem it, by adding codeRouteConfig.RegisterRoutesRouteTable.Routescode to the Global.asax file that it threw me a 404 error.

Negative 451 pI am investigating whether it is possible to transparently encrypt data in a SQL Express database using SQL CLR code to carry out the encryption and decryption.p  pI currently have a system where certain fields need to be encrypteddecrypted, and the cryptography is being carried out in .Net code on the client. Performance is quite appalling  loading 1000 records, each with 4 fields each is taking up to a couple of minutes, using AES.p  pI am using Entity Framework, so Im not wanting to use stored procedures  therefore I cant pass a password in as a param to a stored procedure.p  pIs it feasible to encryptdecrypt data using the .Net machine key i.e. implement AES in SQL Clr, which will use the machine key as the key for encryption. In this case, if the database is copied to another machine, it wont be possible to view real data, as the machine key will be different.p  pI understand that if a user can access the database and log in using eg. SSMS theyll be able to select  from what they like, however I will rely on SQL Server security to prevent this. The main issue is I cant secure the mdf and ldf, and if a user gets access to these I dont want them to be able to view the data.p

Negative 451 pHow do you explicitly set the width of an NSView that already has constraints dictating its minimum width and its maximum widthp  pFor example, consider an codeNSSplitViewcode embedded in a window. In the left pane of the split view is an codeInspectorcode while in the right pane is just some contentp  precode                                lt NSSplitView                                 Inspector     Content                                                                                                                                                                                   Content                                                                                                                codepre  pThe codeInspectorcode has two constraints on it p  ul licodewidth gt 200.0  1000codeli licodewidth lt 400.0  1000codeli ul  pThe only constraints on the split view are ones that allow it to fill its superview and the codeContentcode view only as constraints to fill its superview as well the rightside splitter pane. p  pWhen this view is created, Id like to set the initial width of the codeInspectorcode to a dynamic value something that was saved in the users preferences, perhaps. p  pBut if I just navely do something likep  ul licodewidth  320.0  1000codeli ul  pThen the split view will no longer allow that view to be resized. Values of code499code and code749code also cause the same problem. If I lower the priority to something like p  ul licodewidth  320.0  250codeli ul  pThen the split view will resize, but its initial pane width is not code320.0code but rather code400.0code, as set laidout in Interface Builder. p  pThe ultimate goal is to allow the codeInspectorcode to be both resized within a given range, but to also be hidden or collapsed entirely of which I was hoping to just set the codewidthcode to code0code, and the codeminWidthcode constraint to code0code as well. p  pI suspect I could go down and handle this manually in code[layout]code but Im curious if theres a way to accomplish this entirely with constraints. p  pNote Most of this layout is being done in Interface Builder but Im quite happy to handle the constraints programmatically if needbe. 10.8 is fine as well. p

Negative 451 pIn my project there are lots of Static methods and all are inturn hitting the DB. I am supposed to write Unit Test for the project but often struck with as all the methods are static and they are hitting DB. Is there any way to overcome this. Sorry for being abstract in the question but my concern is what is the way to write unit test for static methods and those hitting DB. MOQ is not useful when the methods are static and also in my project one method is calling other method within the same class. So in this case i cannot MOQ the inside method as both are in the same class.p

Negative 451 pI have a RailsEmber onepage app. Burp reports thatp  blockquote   pThe value of the contenttype JSON parameter is copied into the HTML   document as plain text between tags. The payload   da80balert14f31e was submitted in the contenttype   JSON parameter. This input was echoed unmodified in the applications   response.p blockquote  pI cant quite parse this message referring to is copied into and was submitted in, but basically what is happening isp  ol liA PUT or POST from the client contains code...ltscriptgt...ltscriptgt...code in some field.li liThe server handles this request, and sends back the created object in JSON format, which includes the string in questionli liThe client then displays that string, using the standard EmbersHandlebars codecontenttypecode, which HTMLescapes the string and inserts it into the DOM, so the browser displays it on the screen as originally entered and of course does strongNOTstrong execute it.li ol  pSo yes, the input was indeed echoed unmodified in the applications response. However, the applications response was not HTML, in which case there would indeed be a problem, but JSON, containing strings which when referred to by Handlebars will always be escaped properly for proper display in the browser.p  pSo my question is, is this in fact a vulnerability I have taken great care with my Ember app and can prove that no data from JSON objects is ever inserted raw into the DOM. Or is this a false positive given rise to by the mere fact the unescaped string may be found in the response if looked for using an unintelligent string comparison, not taking into account the fact that the JSON will be processedescaped by the clientside frameworkp  pTo put it a different way, in a classic webapp spitting out HTML from the server, we know that user input such as the above must be escapedsanitized properly. Unsanitized data on the wire in and of itself represents a vulnerability. However, in a onepage app based on JSON coming back from the server, the escapingsanitization occurs in the client the JSON on the wire may contain unsanitized data, and this is as expected. Am I missing something herep

Negative 451 pstrongDirect Questionstrong p  pWhat are best practices for design of database tables for storing urls configured on a page.p  pstrongOur use casestrongp  pWe had a design discussion and were unable to conclude on a what is the correct design. We  are writing a page with URLs embedded in a table. So the page looks likep  precode ....contentsome text...  a     b     c     d  text  url   url   url  text  url   url   url  text  url   url   url  ....contentsome text... codepre  pThe idea is to make these urls configured in database so that url changes does not need a deployment every time it url changes.p  pemEDITem codea,b,c,dcode are table headers. While the content under section codeacode will be a normal text the content under codeb,c,dcode will be hyperlinks.p  pGiven all this what should the table design for this structure. We considered two schemasp  precodea,burl,curl,durl   dependent on table design. advantage written code would                            be very simple and would not be dependent on the number                             of entries in the table.a simple for loop would                             suffice for presentation logic. Disadvantage if table                            changes in future, this table is doomed.                            EDITgta,b,c,d are place holders to represent that content                            represent the headers of table. id, url      advantage Generic enough to encompass any url.                disadvantage This would require presentation layer changes in                 case of new addition of new row.                EDITgtid is just a number to identify this url and would be used to                 refer while identifying this from presentation layer. codepre  pWe were unable to conclude which one of this is better to go with as each have its own tradeoffuntil we have missed something. Or none of this is good.p  pWe are using a NoSql Store and Jsp to write the frontendpresentation logic.p  pEDIT The following can be the type of changes that can happen to the tablep  ol liaddition of a new rowfrequent.li liremoval of an existing rowfrequent.li liOrder of columns can changebut rare.li liNumber of columns changevery rare, do not think ever happened but can happen.li liChange of underlying URLinherently supported in both designs, so not important.li ol  pThe main concern here is maintenance overheadboth in presentation and backend perspective  that will be caused by any one of the design considered.p  pEDIT2p  pSo this project is only about writing front end for the already existing services. We do not have to deal much with so called application state. But on a certain webpage there were a few URLsembedded in the table which I mentioned and business requirement was not to deploy this piece of code every time someone has pus a change requestlike change of existing url which is the most frequent type of change. So all the information on URLs is to be moved to a database and is to be queried on page loador may be preload so that we do not screw the performance of page from the webpage. Now this discussion was about designing a appropriate table for this use.p

Negative 451 pFirst off, I am very new to web services, web workers, and XMLHttpRequests, so please bear with me. Also, there are a lot of stipulations in my project, so solutions to just do it this way may not be viable.p  pSo I have a web service set up to receive calls from an XMLHttpRequest in javascript, and it does this synchronously. This works fine, but it ties up the UI thread, and I would like to have a loading spinner run while making the requests to the server. Due to one issue, I cant have the program access external scripts on the web, so I am using a Blob to mask the file preface.p  pI am also using an inline webworker to accomplish this. Now Im getting to my actual issue. Spawning the webworker is fine, and I can create and send the XMLHttpRequest, but as soon as I call send everything exits. It will run no lines of code after this.p  pstrongHeres some codestrongp  pCalled from JSp  precodevar blob  new Blob[document.querySelectorgetWorker.textContent]  var blobUrl  window.URL.createObjectURLblob  var worker  new Workerwindow.URL.createObjectURLblob worker.onmessage  function e      alerte.data  worker.postMessage codepre  pThe workerp  precodevar bigString    var invocation  new XMLHttpRequest var url  httpltipAddressgtltserviceNamegtService.asmxltmethodgt  if invocation      invocation.openGET, url, false     invocation.send   EXITS AFTER THIS LINE     if invocation.status  200              var responseText  invocation.responseText.replacernnrgm,              responseText  responseText.replaceltxml version1.0 encodingutf8gt,              responseText  responseText.replaceltstring xmlnshttptempuri.orggt,              responseText  responseText.replaceltstringgt,               postMessageSuccess             updateTableresponseText          else              postMessageFail             alertCould not connect to database.

In addition to his user name and password, he will have a challenge  to each signon. That challenge will require that he input a number or  letter depending on what the security application asks him. But your instructor is lazy. He wants an application that will  tell him what those appropriate numbers are without him having to  look them up each time.

Negative 451 pIm looking to create a system which monitors the location of a fleet of drivers, and allows for the bidirectional communication between a driver and a dispatcher. Upstream messages from driver to dispatcher will include current location data of the driver. Downstream messages will include location data of the entire fleet so that a live map of the fleet can be maintained at the drivers end. A pubsub architecture is suited to this, with each driver a client of a server which broadcasts location data. Ive looked into a number of possibilities, including Faye and rabbitmq. Google cloud messaging CCS looks like it has some really nice features, in particular asynchronous messaging, and Im leaning towards using that. However, it is usually used for sending notifications to users to download an update.

Negative 451 pFrom a data structure point of view how does Lucene filter over a range of continuous valuesp  pI understand that Lucene relies upon a compressed bit array data structure akin to a hrefhttpricerca.mat.uniroma3.ituserscolantondocsconcise.pdf relnofollowCONCISEa. Conceptually this bit array holds a 0 for every document that doesnt match a term and a 1 for every document that does match a term. But the coolawesome part is that this array can be highly compressed and is very fast at boolean operations. For example if you want to know which documents contain the terms red and blue then you grab the bit array corresponding to red and the bit array corresponding to blue and AND them together to get a bit array corresponding to matching documents.p  pBut Lucene also provides very fast lookup on ranges of continuous values and if Lucene still uses this same compressed bit array approach, I dont understand how this happens efficiently in computation or memory. Heres my assumption, you tell me how close I am Lucene discretizes the continuous field and creates a bit array for each of these now discrete values. Then when you want a range across values you grab the bit arrays corresponding to this range and just AND them together. Since I suspect there would be TONS of arrays to AND together, then maybe you do this at several levels of granularity so that you can AND together big chunks as much as possible.p  pUPDATE Oh I just realized another alternative that would be faster. Since we know that the bit arrays for the discretized ranges mentioned above will not overlap, then we can store the bit arrays sequentially. If we have a start and end values for our range,  then we can keep an index to the corresponding points in this emarrayem of bit arrays. At that point we just jump in the the array of bit arrays and start scanning it as if were scanning a single bit array. Am I close p

Negative 451 pI have searched the forum, but found nothing that could answer or provide hint on how to do what I wish to on the forum. p  pI have yearly measurement of exposure data from which I wish to calculate individual level annual average based on entry of each individual into the study. For each row the one year exposure assignment should include data from the preceding 12 months starting from the last month before joining the study.  As an example the first person in the sample data joined the study on Feb 7, 2002.  His exposure will include a contribution of January 2002 annual average is 18 and February to December 2001 annual average is 19.  The time weighted average for this person would be   11218   111219.  The two year average exposure for the same person would extend back from January 2002 to February 2000. p  pSimilarly, for last person who joined the study in December 2004 will include contribution on 11 months in 2004 and one month in 2003 and his annual average exposure will be 11125  derived form 2004 and  1126 which comes from the annual average of 2003.p  pHow can I calculate the 1, 2 and 5 year average exposure going back from the date of entry into study How can I use lags in the manner taht I hve describedp  pSample data is accessed from this linkp  pa hrefhttpsdrive.google.comfiled0B4NdfcEvU7La1ZCd2EtbEdaeGsviewuspsharing relnofollowhttpsdrive.google.comfiled0B4NdfcEvU7La1ZCd2EtbEdaeGsviewuspsharingap

Negative 451 pIm working on a mobile game with increasing daily bonuses based on the number of consecutive days they played up to 7 days in a row before resetting. Im looking to increase retention by using push notifications to remind players to log in for their Daily Bonus. p  pThe support staff at our push notification service said this This is possible however we dont have any automatic tracking in place for this. It can be done with tags but you will need to add the logic in your app. You could do this by saving the last time the user used your app and then when they come back to your app compare the time.

Negative 451 pThe PHP function codecryptcode creates a hash for a password. It requires a second parameter for a random salt. This salt can also include additional instructions about which algorithm to use. Seems like a hack, but thats the API. So I add the code6code prefix to get the SHA512 hash I need. Cant use bcrypt for the external nonPHP application that shall also be able to verify the hash. The hash must be verified from PHP and other applications with limited algorithms support.p  pNow there are two problems that the PHP manual leaves me alone withp  p1 Where do I get a random salt and what requirement does it need to satisfy Ive read about codeopensslrandompseudobytescode and I thought Id just base64encode it. But how many source bytes or encoded characters do I needp  p2 How can I verify such a hash in PHP again There doesnt seem to be a single function to do that. I believe I can call codecryptcode again with the same salt as before, but to do that, I need to extract the hash and algorithm and whatever else is needed from the stored password hash. Ive seen hashes with variable number of  characters, so that doesnt seem like a good delimiter to split by.p  pIve read about phpass but it doesnt support sha512, so I cant use that.p  pPHP version is 5.5.9 so some functions may not be available.p

Negative 451 pI have a Word.Chart whose underlying worksheet I am populating with data from C. My problem is however, that the selected dataset in the worksheet contains just the default selection eg. 5x4 cells or sg like that, and not ALL the data which I entered.p  pIf the object were an Excel chart, I could dop  precodeExcel.Range rangeBegin  ws.Cells[1, 1] Excel.Range rangeEnd  ws.Cells[xAxisContents.Count  1, feeds.Count  1] Excel.Range chartRange  ws.getRangerangeBegin, rangeEnd  wordChart.SetSourceDatachartRange codepre  pHowever, the Word.Charts SetSourceData method only accepts a string, and if I call it with an arbitrary range just for testing, eg. wordChart.SetSourceDataA1C3, it fails with a ComExceptionEFAIL.p  pI have also found this code on a Microsoft blogp  precodeExcel.Range tblRng  dataSheet.getRangeA1, B5 Excel.ListObject tbl  dataSheet.ListObjects[Table1]  tbl.ResizetblRng codepre  pwhich I think is meant to resize the selected dataset to the size of the worksheet.

Negative 451 pSo Im trying to solve this exercise from think pythonp  pExercise 6  From Chapter 12p  blockquote   pWhat is the longest English word, that remains a valid English word,   as you remove its letters one at a timep      pNow, letters can be removed from either end, or the middle, but you   cant rearrange any of the letters. Every time you drop a letter, you   wind up with another English word. If you do that, youre eventually   going to wind up with one letter and that too is going to be an   English wordone thats found in the dictionary. I want to know whats   the longest word and how many letters does it havep      pIm going to give you a little modest example Sprite. Ok You start   off with sprite, you take a letter off, one from the interior of the   word, take the r away, and were left with the word spite, then we   take the e off the end, were left with spit, we take the s off, were   left with pit, it, and I.p      pWrite a program to find all words that can be reduced in this way, and   then find the longest one.p blockquote  pI started writing some functions but Im stuck at the checkdict functionp  precodeusrbinenv python   coding utf8   def wordlisttextfilewords.txt     res       for word in opentextfile         word  word.strip         res[word]  word     return res  def childrens, wl     i  0     children  []     while i lt lens         temp  s[i]  s[i1]         if temp in wl             children.appendtemp         i  1     return children  def checkdicts, wl, res  [], called  0     if lens  1 and s in wl         res.appends         return res     else         for child in childrens, wl             printres,call number , strcalled, with s  , s, whose children are , childrens, wl             res.appendchild             checkdictchild, wl, res, called1  wl  wordlist printcheckdictat, wl codepre  pThe problem I have is that it returns None instead of returning the contents of res unless I run the function with the base case which is s  a or s  i. I know this function runs through every possible path and as such it should return a couple of different ress but I dont quite understand how could I get this function to print only one res that goes all the way from the parameter with which the function is called to the 1 letter long s that adequates to the base case condition.p  pI know there is a solution on the book but I want to know what Im doing wrong and how could I fix my version.p

Negative 451 pI wrote a simple program to call libnetutils to do some network staff within Android NDK. Now I set a new address to the interface, as eth0, it is not original Android, and update the ethernetipeth0 in the Android settings.db which location is datadatacom.android.providers.settingsdatabasessettings.db. Then I disable the interface and reenable it, found out the ip which I set changed to something else.p  pI heard that Android SDK developer use the ConnectivityManager.java to control the network state, and when I do disable and enable interface, it would listen the network state. After I enable the interface, it would set a ip to the interface, otherwise, the ip would be 0.0.0.0. p  pBut when I reset the device, the ip which set to interface is form the settings.db, just after Android netwrok service had been activated. p  pI am not familar with wifi and mobile network, but I think it have to be somewhere to hold the ip, the kernel and the driver would not do itp  pwhat is the ip ConnectivityManager re set to the interface, and how ConnectivityManager get the ipp

Negative 451 pI have a relational database which id of records in one table is being used as a foreign key in other relational tables. I have a delete operation. Of course I want to prevent deleting any record whom id is being used as a foreign key in another table.

Negative 451 pI have a single Windows Amazon EC2 instance and one public IP.  The instance is running multiple web server EXEs which all sit on port 80.  I want to have different domain names which I want to point to each server.  On my old dedicated server I achieved this simply by having different public IPs, but with Amazon EC2 I want to keep to just one public IP.p  pI am not using IIS, Apache, etc. otherwise life would be a lot simpler I would simply bind hostnames accordingly. The web server executables perform unusual utility tasks as part of a range of other websites, but still need to be hosted on port 80.  There is no configuration other than address to bind to and port .p  pI have setup several private IPs and bound each server application to those private IPs.  Is it possible to leverage some of the Amazon networking products to direct the traffic to the correct private IP  e.g. I have tried setting up a privateDNS using Amazon Route53, and internally at least this seems to point to the correct servers  but not perhaps logically when I try to access the site externally.p

Negative 451 pI have two entity classes  Users and Tasks. Every User has the following  properties  strongUserIdstrongint, strongUsernamestrongstring, strongPasswordstrongstring, strongFirstNamestrongstring, strongLastnamestrongstringp  pand every Task, these strongTaskIdstrongint, strongTitlestrongstring, strongDescriptionstrongstring, strongEstimatedTimestrongint, strongCreatedOnstrongDatetime, strongCreatedBystrongint, strongAssignedTostrongint, strongFinishedstrongboolp  pSo strongCreatedBystrong and strongAssignedTostrong are actually UserIds  CreatedBy is the Id of the user, who created the task, and AssignedTo  the id of the one the task is for. I have a database where I use them  no problems there. p  pIn my WebForms Application I use a GridView to show the Tasks. So I hide the TaskId and all the other properties are shown as columns in the GridView. But, the problem is, I dont want my users to see the values in CreatedBy and AssignedTo as idsintegers  I want them to see the values as Usernames, so it would look like this AssignedTo  myUsername,  and not like this AssignedTo  321.p  pThis is my first problem, I dont know how to do that. As you will see in my code, the ItemTemplate is a Label, Bound to the property AssignedTo. How can I keep the value invisible and display the username insteadp  pSecond, as I log in as an admin, I want to be able to edit the Tasks. So I added these command fields to my GridViewp  precodeltaspCommandField ShowEditButtontrue gt ltaspCommandField ShowDeleteButtontrue gt codepre  pI have a TaskRepository ans UserRepository that I use to access my database.

When you draw onto a Canvas, youre basically customizing the draw behaviour before actually print something a circle, a rectangle, another bitmap on the canvas backing bitmap handled by Android framework canvas is given to you by onDraw. The canvas is the interface that you customize before telling it to draw something. The main point is that when you draw, youre going to emfillem the backing bitmap area. So, if you want to draw a frame around something, you basically have two optionsp  ol liYou can tell the canvas that youre going to clip the drawing area in this case you use clipRect. From now on, every drawing will be applied to the clipped area.li liPrint anything you want by calling one of the draw... methods. Then, if you want to apply the frame, simply overdraw it with a drawRect so the call order will be drawBitmap first and drawRect after. In this way, you fill the backing bitmap with your bitmap. Then you draw on the edges of your bitmap by calling drawRect.li ol  pThe code above is incorrect Ill rewrite the onDraw method by using the 2nd optionp  precodeBitmap bmp  ... this is the bitmap we want to draw  Paint paint  new Paint paint.setStylePaint.Style.STROKE paint.setStrokeWidth10.f      Override     public void onDrawCanvas canvas          if getDrawable  null              return                   canvas already has a backing bitmap.

Negative 451 pWhat CrossDomain Single SignOn implementation best solves my problemp  pI have two domains xy.com amp yz.com which already have their own database of users and are already implementing their user authentications separately. Recently there has been the need to implement CDSSO so that users dont have to log in each time they try to access resources from both domains.p  pIdeally the CDSSO implementation I hope to use should allow custom implementation of authentication, as I hope to call APIs provided by both domains during authentication to confirm a user exists in at least one of the domains user database. p  pIve been looking at Suns OpenSSO which seems to provide a means to extend its AMLoginModule class yet this seems to be a long thing and more annoyingly they seem to stick to GlassFish.p  pIve also considered developing a custom CDSSO to solve our needs. Is this advisablep  pIs this achievable using Suns OpenSSO considering the disparate user database as I there will be no need to make use of the User db that OpenSSO requiresp  pAre there any simpler means of achieving what I intend to achievep  pIn addition both applications which exist on the two domains were developed using PHP. How does this have an effect considering Suns OpenSSO is based on Java EEp  pAre there any clearly specified steps on implementing OpenSSO and or any other SSO implementations from start to finishp  pThanksp
Negative 451 pIn both C and C, codeatexitcode functions are called either inside codeexitcode, or after codemaincode returns which notionally calls codeexitcode codelibcstartmainargc,argv  libcconstructors exitmainargc,argv code.p  pIs there a way to find out if were inside the exit sequence Destructors of C global and local statics are registered with codeatexitcode, so your code can certainly be called into at this stage. Interestingly, on some platforms if you try to create a C localstatic object inside codeexitcode, it deadlocks on the exit lockp  pMy best attempt so far is as followsp  precodestatic bool mainExited  false static void watchMain    static struct MainWatcher      MainWatcher  mainExited  true     watcher  codepre  pWhen you want to watch for exit, you call codewatchMaincode, and codemainExitedcode tells you at any time whether or not the exit sequence has begun  except of course if a laterinitialized localstatic object is destructingp  pCan the technique be improved to correct this, or is there another method that would workp  h3Aside  the use caseh3  pWhile the problem is interesting from a language pointofview a bit like can I tell if Im inside a codecatchcode block, its also useful to outline a usecase. I came across the problem while writing some code which will be run with and without a JVM loaded with either direct calls or calls via JNI. After the JVM exits, the C codeatexitcode handlers are called, and codeJNIOnUnloadcode is not called if the JNI shared library is not unloaded by the class loader.p  pSince the shared librarys objects can be destructed both by explicit destruction and should free their resources, and by cleanup at exit, I need to distinguish these two cases safely, since the JVM is gone by the time we reach the exit code Basically without a bit of sniffing theres no way I can find in the JNI specsdocs for a shared library to know whether the JVM is still there or not, and if its gone, then its certainly wrong to try and free up references we have to Java objects.p

Negative 451 pIm trying to implement an online application single page with angularjs in forntpage and wordpress  woocommerce plugin in backend.p  pFor this purpose Im installed WP RESTful API and activated woocommerce self api. and using angularjs resource for ajax calls with server.p  pThe woocommerce API is protected by oAuth 1.0a protocol.p  pAs I figured out in a hrefhttpstackoverflow.coma283378831589683thisa answer, the right way to request a protected API is just server side calls. So I created a new file in my server named ApiCall.php and wrote the whole secure communication stuffs in that. p  pNow my requests first send to ApiCall.php then the server communicate with woocommerce API which is in the same server and the response will redirect to my angular codep  pAfter all , now Im confusing with this flow and security. When someone can request to woocommerce API, so he can request to ApiCall.php too then the same security calculations will proceed for that person and result will returned to himp  pOn the other side, WP RESTful API have no security contraptions, and data are available with direct ajax calls.p  pIm looking the best approach for this type of communications which a single page application want to get and set data to its backend.p

Negative 451 pSince Crashlytics doesnt work on wearable apps out of the box, Im looking for an optimal way to intercept and report any potential exception thrown in the runtime. I wonder why theyre not being automatically reported to Google Play Developer Consolep  pGoogle already announced that the future Android Wear update will have WiFi support builtin, but even then, not every device is going to be equipped with the adequate hardware.p  pIn that case, my initial idea was to create a subclass of codeApplicationcode and implement codeThread.UncaughtExceptionHandlercode. Then, every exception would have to be marshalled and sent to a handset, using a hrefhttpsdeveloper.android.comreferencecomgoogleandroidgmswearableMessageApi.html relnofollowcodeMessageApicodea. An extension of codeWearableListenerServicecode on the handset would receive a message, unmarshal the exception and pass it to, for instance, Crashlytics.p  pHowever, that raises a few more questions. Theres a risk that the Bluetooth connection between wearable and handset is disrupted, so all errors should be queued and stored on the wearable devices file system.p  pThis seems like an overkill for a simple crash report. Is there an easier way to do thisp

To do this I decompiled the apk with apktools, edited the smali file needed and then recompiled it, but it will not install on the phone for some reason.p  pI then tried to just decompile and recompile the apk without any edits and it also did not work.p  pIs there some special signing that needs to happen for the app to be built and installed properly Or maybe something that I am missing with apktools I have decompiled many other apks and they worked fine, but snapchat is not having any of it. Any help is appreciated, thanks. p

Negative 451 pWe are moving to a more Lean based approach, Kanban the lot. We started breaking down our user stories into very small ones, however a lot of questions are being raised as to what stories should have acceptance tests and what shouldnt.p  pFor example we have split one story into 2. The first creates an entity and some basic fields. The other expands on those fields and adds more functionality. Normally we would write acceptance tests at the end of the second story. However should we be writing a small acceptance test now we have a smaller story and then expand on the acceptance tests when we do the second storyp  pThe argument for it is, that all stories should be testable, the counter argument is its antilean because we are splitting the stories to get them to the testers quicker, but by writing acceptance tests on tiny logic and tests that are going to change slows things down to them anyway. What is the consensus with Lean on how to approach acceptance testing or BDD testing with Lean user storiesp

Negative 451 pIve run into an issue. I have created a dynamic tableView with 2 prototype cells. If you could imagine say an instagram profile. It has information about you the user and the underneath has a feed of all your posts. So I recreated that UI by making a tableView with 2 cells, one is the profile part thats the first cell, then all cells after are generated from each post you have made. The problem is I do a lot of the logic of loading the users information for the first cell in the viewDidLoad and viewWillAppear of the viewController, not the custom cell class.p  pTherefore, the trouble I am having is sharing the outlets from the custom cell class with the view. I want to be able to access the outlets from the custom cell and give them a title, text, color, etc. before loading the table. Is there anyway to do this How do you preload a custom cell I wish you could make a cell nonreusable so that I can connect outlets to the viewController and avoid the outlets cannot be connected to repeating content error. The first cell is not repeating content its specific to the user that loads the page. So idk what to do, any suggestions I tried making the first cell into a viewnot a table cell above the posts table with the repeating cells but then they do not scroll together as one on the page.p

Negative 451 pIm struggling with a REST API design concept.  I have these classesp  precodeuser    firstname    lastname  metadatafields    fieldname  usermetadata    userid    fieldid    value    unique index on [userid, fieldid] codepre  pOk, so users have many metadata and the type of metadata is defined in metadatafields.  Typical HABTM with extra data in the join table.p  pIf I were to update usermetadata through a Rails form, the data would look like thisp  precodeusermetadata    id 1,   userid 2,   fieldid 3,   value foo  codepre  pIf I posted to the userupdate controller, the data would look like thisp  precodeuser    usermetadata      id 1,     fieldid 3,     value foo     codepre  pThe trouble with this approach is that were ignoring the uniqueness of the useridfieldid relationship.  If I change the fieldid in either update, Im not just changing data, Im changing the meaning of that data.  This tends to work fine in Rails because its somewhat of a walled garden, but it breaks down when you open up an API endpoint.p  pIf I allow thisp  precodePATCH apiusermetadata codepre  pThen Im opening myself up to someone modifying the userid or fieldid or both.  Similarly with thisp  precodePATCH apiuseruseridmetadata codepre  pNow userid is set but fieldid can still change.  So really the only way to solve this is to limit the update to a single fieldp  precodePATCH apiuseruseridmetadatafieldid codepre  pOr a bulk updatep  precodePATCH apiuseruseridmetadata codepre  pBut with that call, we have to modify the data structure so that the uniqueness of the useridfieldid relationship is intactp  precodeusermetadata    fieldid1 value1,   fieldid2 value2,   ...  codepre  pId love to hear thoughts here.

Negative 451 pI dont even know if this is possible. Ive already known about using codeCodeDomProvidercode to generate dll at runtime but we have to provide some source code string or some codeCodeCompileUnitcode which represents different parts of code. But I wonder it would be more interesting if we can build any classestypes currently defined in the project to some separate dll at runtime.p  pAt least the code defined that way has support of Intellisense, highlight syntax  and is eligible.p  pCurrently I have to embed the source code as resource Build Action is not Compile but Embedded Resource. When modifying the code, we can change the Build Action to Compile so that hightlighting as well as other designtime features are available. After completing modification, we can change Build Action back to Embedded Resource. At runtime we can load that resource for string content and build the dll normally. This solution is not that bad but I would like to know if there is something better around that Im missing.p  pI hope you could give me some suggestion.p

Negative 451 pI have a MySQL database linked to a scheduling program. When an appointment is made, it is saved in a table called bookings. Even though the appointment is recurring, it is saved as one row. There is a formula that classifies what kind of recurring event it is once a week, twice a week, once a month, etc.. From the manual, all the parameters are as follow p  ul lis  single event.li lid1  every weekday.li lid  every day.li liwxy  every x weeks on y. y corresponds to an 8 bit representation of the weekdays Sunday is 1, Monday is 2, Tuesday is 4, Wednesday is 8, Thursday is 16, Friday is 32, Saturday is 64.li limdx  every x months.li limxyz  the xth y of every z months. x can be first 0, second 1, third 2, fourth 3 or last 4. y corresponds to the weekday Sunday is 1, Monday is 2...Saturday is 7.li ul  pI created a PHP script that queries from the bookings table, but will only bring up the one appointment that shows the start date and end date. It is followed by a freq column, but I do not have a function or set of parameters that can translate that into querying all the recurring events from the start date to the end date. Also, the startdate and enddate columns are in datetime format yyyymmdd 000000.p  pP.S. I cant post a picture because I am a new member, but I have 5 examples. p  ol liw132 is once a week on Fridays li liw18 is once a week on Wednesdays li lid is a daily appointment li lid1 is only on weekdays  5w104 is every 10 weeks on Tuesdays.  li ol
