Positive 10742 pEdited my question to make it more clear. And I am sorry if what im asking is obvious or easy to solve, I am just starting out.p  pHello, I am developing a website which has 2 models for the content Article and Comic. Now I want a system that allows me to tag Articles and Comics with certain keywords. These keywords can then be used to retrieve a list of objects from both the models and display them.p  pAt first, I set up the system as followsp  precodeclass Articlemodels.Model     ..... class Comicmodels.Model     ..... class Tagmodels.Model     tag  models.CharFieldmaxlength  25     article  models.ForeignKeyArticle     comic  models.ForeignKeyComic codepre  pHowever, this did not work out.p  pThen I tried implementing 2 different tag models for the 2 different models ArticleTag and ComicTag, in the following wayp  precodeclass Articlemodels.Model    ..... class ArticleTagmodels.Model    tag  models.CharFieldmaxlength  25    article  models.ForeignKeyArticle  class Comicmodels.Model     ..... class ComicTagmodels.Model     tag  models.CharFieldmaxlength  25     comic  models.ForeignKeyComic codepre  pThis also did not work, as I was able to get a list of tags of an article, but strongI could not get a list of articles that had the same tagstrong. And also it was using 2 different tag models so that was also not preferable. p  pA user suggested a ManyToManyField based on the previous information I had provided. However, how would this exactly workp  pNow, what is the best way to create a content tagging system using Django It should preferably work with just 3 models Article, Comic and Tag, not 4 like I tried. In conclusion, I want a system that lets me get a list of objects from 2 models using one single tag. So, I would really appreciate help of any kind as I am an amateur programming pretty obvious and I am completely stumped by this problem.p

Negative 10742 pI know that a custom JVM can behave a little differently, and Im trying to see if my observed behavior is the same as the real JVM.  Also, Im looking for some way to consistently make this stuff work.p  pThe worst part Ive been seeing is that exceptions are being completely eaten by the JVM.  For instancep  precodepublic myMethodString test extends Remote      iftest.equalsHey         doSomething  codepre  pIve seen two responses in my code to passing in null for test.  One is that it logs NullPointerException.  Nothing else, just that string.p  pThe other is it logs NOTHING AT ALL.  Code execution just stops, and nothing after this code is run even if there is a trycatch around the calling methodp  pAlso, after the exception, the calling thread never seems to continue making bugs like this amazingly hard to track down.  p  pIf I throw a trycatch around this method and log the error, it works fine.p  pAdmittedly Im working on an older JVM with custom code, so I dont expect much help, but has anyone seen behavior like this  Maybe in an old JVM  Is it supposed to throw the exception over the wire, or is it supposed to print a stack trace on the remote systemp  pIs wrapping the exception in a RemoteException and rethrowing it a reasonable solutionp  pAny suggestions  Aside from spec a new JVMthis is so far out of the realm of possibility that it isnt even funnyp

Negative 10742 pIm embarking on a new web app we want do do it RESTfully.  Now it is time to begin designing the interactions, and something sorta basic about REST has me stumped.  I am trying to figure out the best way to mediate the impedance mismatch between REST and OO without falling down the slippery slope of RPC.  Let me give a contrived example.p  pWidgets can be created, modified, and then submitted for review.p  pTo modify a widget with the id of 123, the user does a PUT to myappwidget123 and the new form data.  The server repackages all the form data as a POJO and hands it off to the logic layer for validation and subsequent persistence, invoking WidgetManager.updatewidgetPojo.p  pTo submit a widget for review, the user clicks a button, which also does a PUT to myappwidget123, but now the form data  just has has one field, a status of submitted I dont send all the form data again, just the field I want to change.  However, now the server needs to invoke a different business object, WidgetStateManager.updateState123, submitted, which is going to do some other specialized processing in addition to updating the state. p  pSo, in an attempt to be RESTful, Ive modeled both the widget updates and the submit for review action as PUTs to the same URL, myappwidget123.  So now, in my server side code, I need to figure out what a particular PUT request means in terms of the business functions, and therefore which business functions to invoke.p  pBut how can I reliably determine which function to invoke merely by inspecting the values in the form data  It is SOOO tempting to pass an action field along with the form data, with a value like update or submit for review in the PUT  Then the server could do a switch based on that value.  But that of course is not RESTful and is nothing more than dressed up RPC.p  pIt just doesnt seem safe or scalable to infer what button was clicked just by examining the form data with a bunch of ifthenelses in the restlet.  I can imagine dozens of different actions that could be taken on a widget, and therefore dozens of ifthenelses.  What am I missing here  My gut tells me I havent modeled my resources correctly, or Im missing a particular resource abstraction that would help.p
Negative 10742 pCurrently Im in the process of designing the messaging system for my application which uses AMQP on the backend via RabbitMQ. There are going to be multiple instances where a method can get data from multiple sources at the same time ie. doesnt have to be sequential queries.p  pOriginally, I was going to use the ThreadPool and QueueUserWorkItem for each different request in the method, and then join them up somehow. This may be problematic, because several different components of the application can do this at once, and each component could have a large number of parallel requests which would starve the ThreadPool.p  pIs there a more efficienteffective way of doing thisp

Negative 10742 pEvery few times I run my app on the development server it seems to deadlock.  Im not sure if it also deadlocks on the production server.  I pause the threads and see that one of them is stuck at Permissions.implies162 which is the start of a codesynchronizedcode block.p  pWhat my code does is on the home page, it sends 5 jquery requests at the same time to my codeInitServletcode servlet that has the codeservicecode method codesynchronizedcode. Each time through the service method a different component is initialized, each of them taking about 2 seconds to initialize. It doesnt matter the order in which the threads reach the service method, and this only happens 5 times, during startup time of the server, so I think it should be okay to synchronize the service method.p  pAny suggestions on how to fix this deadlock, or does anyone know if its just a bug with the development serverp  pEDIT Figured out where the deadlock happens, still dont know why though.  While inside the lock for Permissions.implies, one thread calls Class.getDeclaredConstructors0, and never returns from it.  Another thread is waiting to acquire the lock at Permissions.implies.  The first thread that hangs on codegetDeclaredConstructors0code, is doing the class initialization for the standard PersistenceManagerFactory class taken from the GAE example documents.p
Negative 10742 pIll come up with any excuse to get a chance to write my first Android application.

Perhaps someone here has come across a similar issue, resolved it, and is willing to share their insight.p  pIm programming a custompainted cell used in a DataGridView control.

Negative 10742 pSo Ill be providing a few functions via a self hosted in a WindowsService WebServiceHost not sure how to process HTTP GETPOST with ServiceHost, one of which may be called a large amount of the time. This function will also rely on a connection in the appdomain hosted by the WindowsService so it can stay alive over multiple requests.p  pI have the following concerns and would be oh so thankful for any inputthoughtscommentsbrp  ul libConcurrent accessb  how does the WebServiceHost handle a bunch of concurrent requests. Are they queued and processes sequentially or are new instances of the contracts automagically createdli libWebServiceHost  WindowsService communicationb  I need some form of communication from the WebServiceHost to the hosting WindowsService for things like requesting a new session if one does not exist. Perhaps implementing a class which extends the WebServiceHost with events which the WindowsService subscribes to... unless there is another way I can set off an event in the WindowsService when a request is made...li libMultiple WebServiceHosts or Contractsb  Would it give any real performance gain to be running multiple WebServiceHost instances in different threads one per endpoint perhaps  A better understanding of the first point would probably help here.li libWSDLb  Im not sure why probably just need to do more reading, but Im not sure how to get the WebServiceHost base endpoint to respond with a WDSL document describing the available contract. Not required as all the operations will be done via GET requests which will not likely change, but it would be nice to have...li ul  pThats about it for the moment  Ive been reading a lot on WCF and wish Id gotten into it long ago, but definitely still learning.p

Is there any way i can achieve this p  pMy first guess would be to save the array with youtube ids somewhere and on state change when the video stopevent gets fired load the next id from the array. Havent tried this yet because id prefer if the cue gets just gets filled on the init, so it doesnt have to load after a video has been ended. Is This possible p

Negative 10742 pI am writing a program in Java where there are communications between two or more machines using UDP. My application sends objects after serializing them through the network to the other machine where it will be deserialized and dealt with it. I was successful in sending one kind of objects so far.p  pMy problem is that I want the sender to be able to send different kind of objects, and for the receiver to be able to receive them and cast them again to their appropriate types. However, since UDP allocates a byte buffer then receive the data into the buffer, it is impossible to cast or detect the type of the received object as different objects have different sizes.p  pIs there is a way that I can use to send different kind of objects using UDP and then receive them at the other end I dont ask for code here, just some ideasp  pThanksp  pstrongEditstrong I am looking for the best way to sendreceive different objects types without knowing what is the type of the next expected object. Say I have three objects types and I expect receiving any of them at any givin time. Another thing which crossed my mind after Brians comment How to set the buffer size for variable sized datatypes like Strings, Arrays,...etc. As when receiving a UDP packet you have first to allocate a buffer with a size to receive that object. This is somehow related to my original question.p

Negative 10742 pI am working on a J2SE application think kioskstyle app that makes heavy use of resource bundles and i18n.

Negative 10742 pI am working on an algorithm that performs a global thresholding of an 8bit grayscale image into a 1bit  bit packed, such that 1 byte contains 8 pixels  monochrome image.  Each pixel in the Grayscale image can have a luminance value of 0  255.p  pMy environment is Win32 in Microsoft Visual Studio C.p  pI am interested in optimizing the algorithm as much as possible out curiosity,  The 1bit image will be turned into a TIFF.  Currently I am setting the FillOrder to be MSB2LSB Most Significant Bit to Least Significant Bit  just because the TIFF spec suggests this  it doesnt necessarily need to be MSB2LSB p  pJust some background for those who dont knowp  pMSB2LSB orders pixels from left to right in a byte just as pixels are oriented in an image as the X coordinate increases.  If you are traversing the Grayscale image from left to right on the X axis this obviously requires you to think backward as you are packing the bits in your current byte.  With that said, let me show you what I currently have This is in C, I have not attempted ASM or Compiler Intrinsics yet just because I have very little experience with it, but that would be a possibility .p  pBecause the Monochrome image will have 8 pixels per byte, the Width of the monochrome image will be pregrayscaleWidth78prep  pFYI, I assume my largest image to be 6000 pixels widep  pFirst thing I do before any image is processed is p  p1 calculate a look up table of amounts I need to shift into a specific byte given an X coordinate from my grayscale imagep  precodeint shiftlut[6000]  for int x  0  x lt 6000 x       shiftlut[x]  7x8  codepre  pWith this lookup table I can pack a monochrome bit value into the current byte I am working on with something likep  precodemonochromepixel  1 ltlt shiftlut[ grayX ] codepre  pwhich ends up being a huge speed increase over doing p  precodemonochromepixel  1 ltlt shiftlut[ 7x8] codepre  pThe second lookup table I calculate is a Lookup Table that tells me the X index into my monochrome pixel given an X pixel on the Grayscale pixel.

Negative 10742 pIn my research, I found some concern around deploying an online PHP application while leaving its .hg folder or .svn folders in place on the production server.

Wouldnt the solution be to configure the web server to not serve the .hg directory  Does the security concern run deeper than this  I really dont know.

Negative 10742 pIm creating a library of UI elements, and I want the graphics to be custom. At first, I was going to draw everything with code, and take properties such as backgroundbasecolor, backgroundgradientcolor, etc. I was concerned that the user would need to modify too many properties and might get confused. I eventually talked myself into using external graphics, such as buttontopleftover.png and etc. Now Im back and forth. I want people to easily be able to change the skin, so my options are, have them create external graphic libraries, or have them update properties in a front end that would write to XML, such as backgroundbasecolor, backgroundbasehighlight,etc. Anyone have experience with this, and can offer advisep

I now need  inverse trigonometric functions arcsinarccos.p  pMy application is running on an embedded device on which I cant add a second lookup table for arcsin as I am limited in program memory.

The lookup table as a resolution of 14096 which give us an array of 6434 values. Then I have two funcitons sine amp cosine that takes an angle in radian multiplied by 4096 as argument. Those functions convert the given angle to the corresponding angle in the first quadrant and read the corresponding value in the table.p  pMy application runs on dsPIC33F at 40 MIPS an I use the C30 compiling suite.p

Negative 10742 pIve run into some trouble in my programming book while completing an exercise to do with BankAccounts. The question asks p  pCreate a main function that declares an array of 10 BankAccount objects. After the first BankAccount object is entered, ask the user if he or she wants to continue. Prompt the user for BankAccount values until the user wants to quit or enters 10 BankAccount objects, whichever comes first. For each BankAccount entered, display the BankAccount details. Then prompt the user for a term with a value between 1 and 40 inclusive. Continue to prompt the user until a valid value is entered. strongThen pass the array of BankAccount objects, the count of valid objects in the array, and the desired term to a function that calculates and displays the values of each of the BankAccountsstrong after the given number of years at the standard interest rate.p  pI have to use 3 public functions to complete this task. I only start running into problems when I try to computeInterest. If I attempt to pass the term and count to the function and set it up in 2 for loops I will only receive the numbers and balances for a single object. I guess what im asking is How do I get the program to call computeInterest and run through for each BankAccount objectp  pAt the moment my code is set so that it will compile and run perfectly well, however, the question asks for the term and count to be sent to the function while Im only sending the term. p  pIm not sure if Im sending the array of objects to the function Which may be whats causing the trouble.

Negative 10742 pI am not trying to ask another JQuery vs. Prototype vs... topic as I have already read 5 of those on these forums and have been able to gain a lot of knowledge from them. My question is more directly related to wanting the ability to use inheritance for basic classes and not actually sure what would be a good choice. p  pTo be brief, I have the requirement to be able to control theoretical objects in javascript and manipulate them based on user input then display them. p  pI have used JQuery and enjoy how easy it is to modify the DOM which appears to be its main goal. However from all the readings I have done, it seems that JQuery has no intention of assisting you in dealing with classes, inheritance etc. If I have already chosen JQuery to display and manipulate the data what would be a good choice to assist me with the inheritance issue. p  pMy first thought was Mootools or Prototype, however prototype DOM Extension seems to be a very bad approach and would rather wait for Prototype 2.0 unless this isnt an issue on commonly supported browsers now. p  pI had also read about Base2, Joose, and JS.Class, but dont know if they will do what I am hoping for either.  Any suggestions based on the above information would be great, again, I am not trying to figure out the pros and cons of the commonly used JS frameworks.p

Negative 10742 pso Im working on a django application where I have a model Event. Each Event has some attributes, say one of them is hostname which I will use throughout as an example. I need to implement search functionality where a user can search for all events that has hostname  somevalue, e.g. hostname  myhost.foo.bar.p  pNow, I wanted to allow the user to select among the valid options i.e. the hostnames that actually exist in one or more event in a combobox in the search form, so I use ModelChoiceFields for my form. My subclass of ModelChoiceView, for displaying the correct labelp  precodeclass HostnameModelChoiceFieldforms.ModelChoiceField def labelfrominstanceself, obj     return obj.host.hostname codepre  pMy formp  precodeclass QueryFormforms.Form     hostname  HostnameModelChoiceFieldquerysetEvent.objects.all, requiredFalse     ... codepre  pHowever, this gives duplicates because many events may have the same hostname. I attempted using distinct on the queryset but of course that wont work because the objects are distinct even if the displayed values are not.p  pSo, I tried to instead select only the values I needp  precodeclass QueryFormforms.Form     hostname  ModelChoiceFieldquerysetEvent.objects.all.valueslisthostname, hostname.distinct, requiredFalse codepre  pBut this wont validate I suspect because the values are not actual Event instances but just string values.p  pSo I tried a regular ChoiceFieldp  precodehostname  forms.ChoiceFieldchoicesEvent.objects.all.valueslisthostname, hostname.distinct, requiredFalse codepre  pThis works, BUT this list is only populated once, so its not up to date with the database.p  pSo... Is there any good way of solving this problem To recap the question HOW do I populate a combo box with the distinct values from one of the fields of a model, and also keeping it insync with the database I would think that a ModelChoiceField would be the best bet, if I can get it to validate when using .values... or .valueslist....p  pSincerely, Hallgeirp

This thread invokes changes in main form controls using codeControl.Invokecode. My goal I want to make sure that form is closed properly when user presses x on the main form. That means I want my connection to close, all side threads to terminate etc. Im trying to use codeFormClosingcode event.  There I set KillThreads flag to true and wait for side threads to terminate.

If I try to wait for all threads to be terminatedp  precodefor ifActiveSideThreads  0     break closeConnection codepre  pthe thread N3 freezes blocked by codeInvokecode call Sure it is, because the main gui thread is in infinite loop.

Negative 10742 pIm reading about CoffeeScript and am still trying to position the language, what can be done, what are the best practices, etc Im more used to strongly typed languages AS3, Java, Scala so my two questions may make you smile a bit p  pQuestion 1 Custom collectionsp  pWhat do you think about custom collections  JSCS is one of the weakest languages in this aspect For instance there is no Array.remove and you have to use the cumbersome splice method instead. Some function libraries Like underscore augment the API by providing functions taking arraysobjects as the first arg but given the choice I would prefer to writep  precodelist fancyFunction 3, 4 codepre  prather thanp  precodefancyFunction list 3, 4 codepre  pLets say I create a List class Is it possible and if yes, what are the requisites for this class to be able to use CSs comprehension syntax  Worst case scenario, I guess the List could have a toArray method and the usual CS operations could be performed on that returned value instead, but I hope there is a better solution.p  pIdeally, I would like to be able to define rich, custom collections, but not at the cost of losing comprehensions, etc.p  pQuestion 2 Mutabilityp  pWhat are people feelings about being very careful with mutability in CSJS in general p  pWhen I read various code online, I have the impression everything is mutable and people generally think its better not to bother and have less lines of code instead.p  pFor instance, mutable versus immutable basic Point class Hopefully Im not doing something wrongp  pMutablep  precodeclass Point   constructor x, y gt codepre  pImmutablep  precodeclass Point   constructor x, y gt     x  gt x     y  gt y codepre  pNot that much more complicated but slightly weirder syntax. Another consideration is that JS is not the fastest thing known to man and having to create lots of objects in a loop just for the sake of being a purist might be counter productive, performance wise. I didnt benchmark the cost of creating new Point objects versus altering the members of one though.p  pImagine a big app with lots of modules communicating through thin APIs. Wouldnt you want to pass immutable objects around  Or do you perform defensive copies instead p  pNote I am not trying to try and bend CS to the languages I know Rather I want to know if it makes sense to reuse some of the concepts taken for granted in other languages. p  pThanksp
Negative 10742 pIf it possible to force a reauthorization I.E asking for username and password from the LinkedIn oauth apip  pUsecase To protect sensitive data, in case someone forgets to log out, some actions on our site can only be taken after you reverify yourself with your password even when logged in. We allow login using LinkedIn, in which case the user does not have a separate password on our site. In this case we would like to force a reauthorization usernamepassword from the LinkedIn api so that user can still confirm his identity.p  pThe important issue here is that it cannot just accept because the user is already logged in on LinkedIn and has accepted to app, this would not provide any level of security for someone who has forgotten to log out, it has to explicity ask for authorization by password again.p

When I rightclick on the file, I see View History, but when the History Viewer opens, I dont have the same context menu options, especially Show Changes which is the one I need.  I am able to do what I want with the codebehind and designer without any problems.  What I think is confusing Ankh is that the aspx file is actually a parent file to the designer and codebehind.

My last attempt was to include it in the headers hash into the Faraday connection object within the client object OAuth2Client instance of the class.p  pAfter debugging almost the whole process, and trying to include it everywhere, my provider keeps not getting that particular key in the headers, even debugging the provider when Devise is testing each strategy... but not luck after all.p  pI really appreciate if someone would tell me what Im doing wrong or if what Im trying to accomplish cannot be done in the way Im doing it or if there is a simpler way to do it..p  pThanks in advance, sorry for the very long postquestion, and thanks again for your timep

Negative 10742 pCurrently, I am trying to connect a to custom built Drupal 7 service module with a flash client.  I can connect to my the amfserver service properly and actually use the Node service to grab and manipulate nodes.  I am trying to build a custom service to remotely provide functions not provided by the available services.

Negative 10742 pSo my site relies heavily on Jquery and code.postcode, essentially there is only an index.php page and all the content is loaded via AJAX request from my php. Now, the history plugins look great, BBQ, history.js, etc but they all seem to utilize the anchor tag which I use non of. I might have gotten away with using one but I have buttons that need different classes and ids so I cant use one class for every button and somehow use code.triggercode to call an event based on the hash in the url. My question is this. Without a complete overhaul of my site because its basically finished, is there an easy way to implement a back button without an anchor tagp  pSorry if Im not clear I can try to explain more if needed, thanks for the help in advancep

The restart is currently happening only at 0300 for maintenance reasons.p  pTherefore I was wondering, if I can set session timeouts in Tomcat for GWT applications In the web.xml the timeout is set to 30min but I think it is not really working with a GWT application.p
Negative 10742 pConsider an application that stores inventory for a store, which consists of hundreds of item types and quantities of each item. I currently have a database mapped out which can handles this, which was natural to design due to a background in procedural programming. However, I am now working in an OOP language C and I am considering storing the inventory and other entities branch offices, employees, suppliers as CLR objects, grouped in ObservableCollections, and then persisted to the database via an ORM such as NHibernate.p  pMy concern is that having ObservableCollections with hundreds or thousands of items in memory at all times will be a resource and performance barrier. I am also worried about potential dataloss considering equipment failure or power outage. As the system will be recording financial transactions sales the reliability of a database is rather important. Specifically, having all changes  sales in the database at the time of transaction, as opposed to whenever the ORM persists back is important to me.p  pShould I work directly with the database, or should I work with objects and let the ORM handle the storagep
Negative 10742 pI have a multiconfiguration build which is building on a variety of operating systems currently only 32 bit and 64 bit Linux, but more to be added. The builds produce an install directory that I want to archive. In a previous freestyle build of the same software on a single target I was able to do this by specifying Archive the artifacts with Files to archive set to install but when I do this on the multiconfiguration build Jenkins claims it cant find anything to archive.p  pThe workspaces on the slaves doing the actual builds do create install directories as AllOSesLinux32install and AllOSesLinux64install. What am I doing wrongp  pUpdate The problem only happens when I have a Windows slave node in the Jenkins system. If the Windows slave node is present Jenkins seems to notice that this is not in use, and runs the control section of the job on the Windows slave node. Somehow this then causes the archive step to fail maybe because it expects Windows path names.p  pIf I disable the Windows slave node the control part of the job runs on the master node, which is running 32 bit Linux, and everything works correctly. p  pThis doesnt provide a solution, since I need the Windows node enabled for other jobs, and I can find no way of specifying where the controller for a multiconfigation job should run, but it does change the question. p

Negative 10742 pIs it possible to embed an external CLIC DLL into a MFC EXE as a embedded resource or something like that My application currently connects to DLL sitting right beside it that has some basic functions like connect to database, pull information from DB, etc..p  pI use LoadLibrary to use the DLL functions. Then I secure my EXE with themida and pack the EXE and DLL together. The problem is though to pack the DLL and EXE I have to disable file patching in themida which is a very strong feature. I have to disable it because when I pack my EXE it needs to modify the file a bit, and then themida thinks it has been cracked or something and does not allow the application to work.p  pSo is there a way to embed this DLL into my EXE The DLL is not compatible with themida sadly which is why it is a separate file.p

Negative 10742 pI know there are some similar threads but my code doesnt look anything like those questions and am not sure how to adopt.  I think my approach can probably work, but I am just not getting the desired result.  p  pI am trying to export a MySQL db to a csv file.

Negative 10742 h2Preambleh2  pMy SVN hosting is provided by a 3rd party which limits my usage to 300MB. As the project is only of a moderate size, I never imagined this would be a problem. Once the app went to production, I realised that I needed some kind of backup mechanism. So I wrote a shell script that exports the database and zips up useruploaded files. I then commit both the .sql and .zip files to SVN the SVN server does not run on the same machine as the app.p  pThen today I noticed that Ive exceeded the quota. I quickly realised that this must be because of the backups. p  h2Finally...The Questionh2  pBecause the .zip is a binary file, I guess the whole file is added to the repository each time its committed whereas for a text file only the diff is added The .zip file is currently about 60MB, so given that the backup script runs daily, I can only store 5 days worth of backups in SVN.p  pAnyway, I plan to improve the situation byp  ul lipChanging the backup script so that it compares the size of the .zip with the latest .zip in SVN and only commits if they are different. The two will be the same size if no users have uploaded files since the last time the backup ranpli lipRemoving all the old versions of the .zip file from SVN to free up some quota. However, I dont know if this is actually possible My understanding is that even if I delete the file from my working copy and commit the delete, the file will be removed from the HEAD of the repository, but all the previously committed versions will still be there using up my precious quota.pli ul  pIs there some way that I can permanently remove all the old versions of the .zip, and start anew with the more efficient backup strategy described above.p

Negative 10742 pI have set up my simple Xcode project with a table that is binded to an array controller.  It works fine if the array controller is full of entities with a string attribute.

Negative 10742 pSeveral of our apps use multiple databases from the example below  each in their own separate DBML file. The problem is, MVC by convention puts them all in codenamespace AppName.Modelscode causing class name conflicts.p  pWhich of the two options is the better fix and whyp  p1. Putting them in separate namespaces.

On top of that, in order to keep the same naming for codeHelpercode file code reuse  even apps that only use one database would need a subfolder in codeModelscode, which I certainly never see people doing in MVCh3  p2. Prepending all object names in one or both DBML designers with a prefix. This is my current approach. The Live database has codeCustomercode and codeOrdercode objects, while the Crm database has codeCrmCustomercode and codeCrmOrdercode. They all stay in the same namespace and codeModelscode folder. This, however has two main drawbacksp  ul liQuite a bit of prefix redundancy in accessing child objects codeCrmCustomer.CrmOrders.First.CrmOrderTypecode Marsha Marsha Marshali liIn other apps which only use one database, we often omit the prefix  and then during code reuse or codeHelpercode files we have to do a lot of findreplace. This is particularly evident in codeHelpercode files that get added to every app like erroractivity logging.li ul  pSo Id like to hear from other experts which of the two strategies they use, or something else entirely. It seems like a pretty common occurrence to have at least some name conflicts between databases.

Negative 10742 pIve been setting up Spring namespaces using codeschemaLocationcode in Eclipse without issue, but now I need to work without a network connection so I cant look up the the schemas from springframework.org.p  pI know that when I bring a Spring component using Maven, I get the schemas I need and some files that map namespace handlers. How do I set up Eclipse to use these files in such a way that everything required is in the projectp  pI know about the XML catalog in Eclipse, but setting this up would seem to involve lots of manual activities on any workstation I use that needs to be done every time I use a new Spring component or change versions. It seems that everything I need comes in the Spring jar, so how do I set up use this stuff instead of any external setup, so that I have everything I need to work and build in the Eclipse project itselfp

Negative 10742 pWhat I have at the moment an achievement site, where users can view achievements stored in div boxes all styled with strong.unselectstrong and then change to the style strong.selectstrong when clicked on using jQuery.

Negative 10742 pSo, I have an Access 2007 FE with an SQL BE.  I am using a bound form for both adding a new record, or updating an existing record.p  pMy problem is this Unlike a local Access table, using SQL tables cause the AutoNumber field SeqID to not be available until after the record is saved.  I have a save button on the form, which does various validation steps on a new record, then adds a new record to the table upon successful validation.  At that point, Im able to get the AutoNumber for that record in my code, but the problem is that I cannot get the form to updatedisplay it in the SeqID field.  Because its a bound form, I cannot simply update the SeqID.Value.  I need to have this field updated because it is used for other things later on, such as audit trails for changed fields, etc.p  pAny help would be greatly appreciated.p
Negative 10742 pThe phonetextbox control in the silverlight toolkit is bugged because tapping on the action item which is inside the textbox causes the textbox to acquire focus and bring up the keyboard. In the handler of the action item the phonetextbox is then returning focus to the root, but that causes the keyboard to appear and then disappear. p  pOn iOS I would simply detect the button press in a will accept focus handler and refuse focus. Does there exist a will accept focus for windows phone controls Such that you can hit test and return false if you dont want focus. p  pOr if anyone knows if there is another way to have the keyboard not appear on focus so it wont flicker in and out. p  pIf not I will simply add a button outside of the control to clear its contents, unless anyone has other ideas.

Negative 10742 pIm just cleaning up some code we wrote a while back and noticed that for a udp socket, 0 is being treated as the connection closed.p  pIm quite sure this was the result of porting the same recv loop from the equivalent tcp version.  But it makes me wonder.  Can recv return 0 for udp  on tcp it signals the other end has closed the connection.  udp doesnt have the concept of a connection so can it return 0 and if it can, what is its meaning  p  pNote the man page in linux does not distinguish udp and tcp for a return code of zero which may be why we kept the check in the code.p

Because we have to frequenly scan for userids, update game status almost at every insert. It can be a cache utility OR a fast ScanSearch algorithm OR even a CollectionModel. Right now, we use a foreach loop to go through all records in a codeDataTablecode and update rows if user is present. If not then we create a new row.

Negative 10742 pIm going to preface this by saying that I understand the new Windows 8 application lifecycle and how it is now 100 up to the user to decide if they want to terminate the app or not. So, I guess what Im looking to find is a way to pseudorestart my app, although Im open to other suggestions as Im pretty new to designing Modern UI apps.p  pIm building an app that interfaces with a Web 2.0 service that requires authentication via OAuth. Fortunately the Windows 8 WebAuthenticationBroker makes this simple it displays an asynchronous modal window that houses the web frame to allow the user to sign in and I get to provide a callback method when its done.p  pNow, obviously I only want to display this signin screen if I dont already have a session key stored for the user in roamingSettings.values. I used the Grid App template in Visual Studio, and I execute these functions in default.js as soon as the app is activated checking roamingStorage, calling WebAuthBroker, etc. Now, the Grid App template provides a data.js to allow me to define some of the REST endpoints that I want to fetch. The main problem is that I cant fetch these REST endpoints until the user is authenticated Yet they still have to at least, I think be declared in data.js ahead of time. So what Im doing now to avoid errors in the event that the user isnt signed in, is the followingp  precodeif roamingSettings.values[sessionKey]    list  getFeedItems  my function that issues all the REST calls  else     list  new WinJS.Binding.List  codepre  pThis works fine if the app is manually restarted after authentication is complete, but I would really rather have a way of completely reloading the app asynchronously after authentication is complete. Ive spent a ton of time on this already and Im getting extremely annoyed because Ive seen other apps do this Instametrogram, for example.p  pAny ideasp

Negative 10742 pIn Visual Studio 2010 and earlier, the Find in Files feature remembered your selection for the Look in option.p  pIn 2012, the option sometimes gets reset to Current Document, making it only search in a single file.

It will have changed the Look In setting to Selection. Close it, deselect the text and do Find in Files again. The setting will have silently reverted to Current Document.

Negative 10742 pI have two tables, X and Y, with identical schema but different records.  Given a record from X, I need a query to find the closest matching record in Y that contains NULL values for nonmatching columns.  Identity columns should be excluded from the comparison.  For example, if my record looked like thisp  precode id  col1  col2  col3  0  abc def  ghi codepre  pAnd table Y looked like thisp  precode id  col1  col2  col3  6  abc def  zzz 8   NULL def  NULL codepre  pThen the closest match would be record 8, since where the columns dont match, there are NULL values.  6 WOULD have been the closest match, but the zzz disqualified it.p  pWhats unique about this problem is that the schema of the tables is unknown besides the id column and the data types.  There could be 4 columns, or there could be 7 columns.  We just dont know  its dynamic.  All we know is that there is going to be an id column and that the columns will be strings, either varchar or nvarchar.p  pWhat is the best query in this case to pick the closest matching record out of Y, given a record from X  Im actually writing a function.  The input is an integer the id of a record in X and the output is an integer the id of a record in Y, or NULL. Im an SQL novice, so a brief explanation of whats happening in your solution would help me greatly.p

So if the circle contains many checkboxes there exists a lot of Route objects at the same time. Maybe its important to reproduce my problem.br The Route has always the same startPosition. Its the Position the user clicked.br In the List nodes I save the steps to build the cricle.  p  pNow what I get is the inside the findConnection methode the List nextPosition sometimes contains Positions which doesnt even exsists inside the this.nodes[this.nodes.Count  1].nearPositions list. Thats why I added the extra condition inside the foreach loop.  p  pMy thoughts where that its maybe a bug of the .FindAll method or a problem with the exitsting of mutiple eoutes at the same time.  p  pSo my questionsbr  1. Can you reproduce my issuebr  2. Where does it come frombr  3. How can i solve it  p  pThank you for you responsesp

For example in a workflow, if step 3 is on hold for a given amount of time either flash a message across the tile, a color, etc. Any help, direction, resouces are greatly appreciated. Thanks.p  pAlexp

Negative 10742 pI am new to java but I am actually liking it because, believe it or not, it is improving the way I code. I guess because it forces you to write the code OO wayp  pAnyways, I am writing a java library which looks like this. On the base there is core library and then some toolkits built on top of it.p  pNow all the toolkits have part of code in common.p  pFor example, reading the config file for that toolkit. Example toolkitAconfigconfig.cfgp  precodeconfig.cfg inputDir  pathtoinput outputDir  pathtooutput    toolkitBconfigconfig.cfg  config.cfg inputDir  pathtoinput  no output here.. maybe this toolkit is just to analyze the input codepre  pThe issue is.. alot of these configs are unknown as I am still in process of creating a toolkit and even I dont know what toolkit will be there in future.p  pAs of now, the code flow is as follows.p  precode maingt readconfiggtparseconfiggt execute the source code with params.    parsed from the source parseconfig codepre  pMy key question is as these config files are in the toolkits level, these config doesnt connects at all with the source code library. The core library is oblivious of the fact that these parameters are actually set up by user in config file. Now... maybe its because of java but I find this very superficial.

Negative 10742 pIm trying to show a 2D array as a table in a page. I know this sounds as if I was reinventing the wheel but the object I have to handle is a 2D array of a custom type that must also be rendered in a particular way always the same.p  pThe tricky part is that this 2D array can have null values in some of its indexes. In those cases, a particular unavailable cell must be rendered. The table structure yes... codelttablegtcode codelttrgtcode and codelttdgtcode was already defined by the emDesign Teamem and accepted by the client.p  hr  pIve tried to use codeltcforEachgtcode but got in trouble trying to make it work, because of the order in which JSTL and JSF tags are managed. When the JSF tags are handled there are some issues that include outdated values and missing components.p  pThe array attribute of a codeViewScopedcode bean is always null when codeltcforEachgtcode is invoked, even when I force the creation of the arrayp  precodepublic MyObject[][] getMatrix      ifloadedMatrix  null         initializeMatrix     return loadedMatrix.getTable  codepre  pThe codeinitializeMatrixcode method obtains the corresponding data from the database and invokes the logic that creates the 2D array, making codeloadedMatrixcode reference it once its created all of this works, no exceptions or errors. When codeinitializeMatrixcode finishes, codeloadedMatrixcode is still codenullcode.p  pI went for the nested codeltcforEachgtcode option because I need to manage the indexes of the table to know what to render if the object is null, has an availability flag set to false or if it can be rendered normally, but as for now I think the safest solution is to create a custom component. p  hr  pemMy question isem What alternatives do I have to render the content of a 2D array as a table while being aware of the indexes Im rendering.p  pThanks in advancep

Negative 10742 pIn my Windows Phone apps main page, users can click a button to do some stuff and that will trigger the live tile to update.p  pThe problem I am having is, if the user clicks the button and then hit the phones Back button really quickly, the live tile sometimes will not render properly. This issue rarely happens, but it does happen and when it happens it just looks bad...p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comsX1co.png altenter image description herep  pThe way I implement the live tile is, create a user control that looks exactly the same as the live tile and then save it to isolated storage. Then retrieve it and store it in a FliptileData object. Finally I call the Update method on the ShellTile. Please see the following piece of code to demonstrate the process.p  precode     the function that saves the user control to isolated storage     public Uri SaveJpegToIsolatedStorageFrameworkElement tile, string suffix, int tileWidth  336, int tileHeight  336              var bmp  new WriteableBitmaptileWidth, tileHeight           Force the content to layout itself properly         tile.Measurenew SizetileWidth, tileHeight         tile.Arrangenew Rect0, 0, tileWidth, tileHeight          bmp.Rendertile, null         bmp.Invalidate           Obtain the virtual store for the application         IsolatedStorageFile myStore  IsolatedStorageFile.GetUserStoreForApplication         using IsolatedStorageFileStream fileStream  new IsolatedStorageFileStreamIsolatedStorageFileName  suffix, FileMode.Create, myStore                      try                              bmp.SaveJpegfileStream, tileWidth, tileHeight, 0, 100                          catch Exception                              return null                                return new Uriisostore  IsolatedStorageFileName  suffix, UriKind.Absolute            save the user control to isolated storage and prepare the FlipTileData object     wideFrontTileImage  SaveJpegToIsolatedStorageUserControlthis.WideFrontTile, widefront, 691     var flipTileData  new FlipTileData     flipTileData.WideBackgroundImage  wideFrontTileImage     return flipTileData       update the live tile    var shellTile  ShellTile.ActiveTiles.FirstOrDefault    shellTile.UpdatecustomTile.GetFlipTileDatadata.UndoneMemosCount  0 ampamp data.TotalMemosCount  0 codepre  pI think the reason thats causing all this is, when the user clicks the Back button too quickly, the OS terminates all the processes running within the app and the rendering wasnt done at that time. Im thinking if theres a way to know when the rendering is finished, so I can cancel the Back button and wait until its finished then manually exit the app. But I simply dunno how...p  pAny help on this one will be greatly appreciatedp

Negative 10742 pAfter a bunch of reading this afternoon, and not getting any tangible results.  Is it possible to host a windows forms dialog inside of a MFC application that is still being developed using VC6.  p  pThe issue arises is that we have a large application that has never been upgraded with the new Visual Studios because VC6 always worked.  Now we need to add some of the C functionality in it.  I am unable to do the clr option as our project consists entirely of unmanaged C.

Negative 10742 pIve been trying for a while to find the best way to word this problem and hopefully have come up with something decent.p  pI have an app with one main screen with a few buttons on it that segue to popovers.  I have a Tap Gesture Recognizer for the screen as well.p  pOn an iOS5 iPad if I tap the buttons, the Tap Gesture Recognizer seems to be handling the action but on an iOS6 iPad, the buttons handle the action.  The only way to get the button to press, instead of the Tap Gesture Recognizer, is to do a long press.p  pWhy do the taps pass through the Tap Gesture Recognizer in iOS6 but get caught by it in iOS5p  pId be happy to add any code but this is pretty much all storyboards.p
Negative 10742 pI am trying to create a distributed processing system on Android through Bluetooth, so I created a class that implements Serializable, made a method to serialize and deserialize that object so that I can send it as a ByteArray. The problem is that I need each object to have a different code to be run on the other devices. I thought of overriding a method, then running that method on the other device, but when I do so, I get a NotSerializableException. Is there any way to fix that Or if not, is there an alternative way to send different pieces of code to be executed on other devicesp

Negative 10742 pI am using several Eigen MatrixXd and VectorXd, but I am getting somewhat confused about what is Dynamic vs Fixed Size. According to Eigen documentation, the size of fixed structures is known at emcompile timeem. With every Matrix I use I define their size when I instantiate them, and do not change the size while the program is running.p  pMore precisely, I am using a class with several MatrixXd and VectorXd members, with their size being defined on the constructor of the class.

Negative 10742 pI am having a sudden issue with installing Plone 4.2.4.

Negative 10742 pI wrote some code in VB.Net a while ago that is using XElement, XDocument, etc... to store and manipulate HTML.  Some of the HTML makes use of attribute names that contain a hyphendash .

Negative 10742 pI am quite new to web grid systems but would like to choose SUSY mainly because so many people recommend it.  What Id like to achieve is something similar to what I see with the grid system in Twitter bootstrap, where the columns are not fluid in width, but the entire grid width has two or three predefined widths based on available resolution.p  pSo, for example, Id like to have an 8 column grid, with a grid width of 1140px if available, else 960px.  p  pI was able to come up with something similar with SUSY, where my max container width was 1140px, and by setting a minwidth of 960px it would never resize below that, but the grid was fluid between the two and my preference is for it to simple switch from one to the other when the resolution becomes available.  This is mainly to have 2 or 3 predictable layouts.p  pMany thanks if anyone can help. Chris Chandlerp

Negative 10742 pa hrefhttpsvimeo.com70999946 relnofollowhttpsvimeo.com70999946ap  pI implemented a recursive path finding algorithm. This recursive algorithm works based on a preset of nodes connected together. Each node has four pointers containing further direction Top, Button, Left and Right. The recursive algorithm simply walks through each node and looking for each of these four directions one by one toward reaching its final destination an illustration, consider the following 7 nodes A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H.p  precode    A ButtongtD, RightgtB     B RightgtC, LeftgtB     C LeftgtB     D ButtongtG, RightgtE, TopgtA     E RightgtF, LeftgtD     F LeftgtE     G RightgtH, TopgtD     H LeftgtG codepre  pThese nodes when comes to an overall view will display the following figure.p  precodeABC  DEF  GH codepre  pIn this example, suppose the walker started node is Node A and wants to go to Node H as its final destination. Node A looks at its own Right, Button, Left and Top by order its right pointed to Node B as a result he chooses to go to Node B Node B in same pattern chooses to go to its right, Node C. When the walker reaches node C as its Right, Top and Button is blocked, Node C reverts back to Node B. As well node B reverts back Node A. The walker comes back to the start point again. Then Node A goes to its button node base on the order which means it goes to Node D. Node D goes to its right Node E and then Node F. As Node F is blocked it goes back to Node E and Node D. Afterwards, Node D chooses to go its button, Node G according to walker order. From there Node G goes to Node H. Finally, the walker reaches its final destination.p  precodePseudocode Recursive Path Finding Algorithm ArrayList findPathGameObject currentPoint , GameObject targetPoint , ArrayList InputArrayList  1Duplicate InputArrayList as tempArrayList  2If the currentPoint equals to target Point return inputArrayList  End Condition found target  3If the Right side of the currentPoint is empty goto step 4 3.1 Add currentPoint to tempArrayList  Call Right 3.2 tempArrayList  findPathcurrentpoint.Right, targetPoint, tempArrayList 3.3 If tempArrayList is not null return tempArrayList 4If the Button side of the currentPoint is empty goto step 5 4.1 Add currentPoint to tempArrayList  Call Button 4.2 tempArrayList  findPathcurrentpoint.Button, targetPoint, tempArrayList 4.3 If tempArrayList is not null return tempArrayList 5If the Left side of the currentPoint is empty goto step 6 5.1 Add currentPoint to tempArrayList  Call Left 5.2 tempArrayList  findPathcurrentpoint.Left, targetPoint, tempArrayList 5.3 If tempArrayList is not null return tempArrayList 6If the Top side of the currentPoint is empty goto step 7 6.1 Add currentPoint to tempArrayList  Call Top 6.2 tempArrayList  findPathcurrentpoint.Top, targetPoint, tempArrayList 6.3 If tempArrayList is not null return tempArrayList 7Return null  End Condition does not found target  codepre  pNote The actual code is in C, You can download it from this a hrefhttpwww.mandanemedia.comwpcontentuploads201307pathManager.cs relnofollowlinka.p  pRise of problem in the case study As you understand this code it has a weakness, to illustrate it considering the following overall view of nodes, with the assumption that the start node is Node A and the final destination is Node H.p  precodeABC  DEFI      GHJK codepre  pThough the best path solution is A, D, G, H, The explained recursive path finding algorithm finds A, D, E, F, I, K, J, H as its solution this really seems the Robot is a stupid robot D p  pFigure 1 The recursive path finding algorithm img srchttpi.stack.imgur.comkgyTg.png altenter image description herep  pFigure 2 The recursive path finding algorithm with the ability to learn img srchttpi.stack.imgur.com27pgT.png altenter image description herep  pI resolved the problem by adding the learning ability for the nodes.

Negative 10742 pIm writing a python script for cygwin and linux environments to run regression testing on a program that is run from the command line using subprocess.Popen. Basically, I have a set of jobs, a subset of which need to be run depending on the needs of the developer on the order of 10 to 1000. Each job can take anywhere from a few seconds to 20 minutes to complete. p  pI have my jobs running successfully across multiple processors, but Im trying to eke out some time savings by intelligently ordering the jobs based on past performance to run the longer jobs first. The complication is that some jobs steady state calculations need to be run before others the transients based on the initial conditions determined by the steady state. p  pMy current method of handling this is to run the parent job and all child jobs recursively on the same process, but some jobs have multiple, longrunning children. Once the parent job is complete, Id like to add the children back to the pool to farm out to other processes, but they would need to be added to the head of the queue. Im not sure I can do this with multiprocessing.Pool. I looked for examples with Manager, but they all are based on networking it seems, and not particularly applicable. Any help in the form of code or links to a good tutorial on multiprocessing Ive googled... would be much appreciated.  Heres a skeleton of the code for what Ive got so far, commented to point out the child jobs that I would like spawned off on other processors. p  precodeimport multiprocessing import subprocess  class Jobobject   def initself, popenArgs, runTime, children     self.popenArgs  popenArgs list to be fed to popen     self.runTime  runTime Approximate runTime for the job     self.children  children Jobs that require this job to run first  def runJobjob   subprocess.Popenjob.popenArgs.wait      I want to remove this, and instead kick these back to the pool   for j in job.children      runJobj     def mainjobs    This jobs argument contains only jobs which are ready to be run    ie no children, only parentless jobs   jobs.sortkeylambda job job.runTime, reverseTrue   multiprocessing.Pool4.maprunJob, jobs codepre

Negative 10742 pI am trying out Jquery File Upload from blueimp. The documentation says I should be able to limit the number of files to be uploaded with the maxNumberOfFiles setting. p  pHowever, that doesnt seem to be working in my case. None of the others such as acceptFileTypes, loadImageMaxFileSize etc seem to be working either probably I have to include other js files  dont know really which ones or how to hook em up despite researching quite a lot . I am using the basic version of the plugin. Here is how my code looksp  pJS files includedp  ol lijqueryuiwidget.jsli lijqueryiframetransport.jsli lijqueryfileupload.jsli litmpl.jsli ol  pThe JS Codep  precodefileupload.fileupload   maxFileSize 3  1024   minFileSize 1   maxNumberOfFiles maxFilesAllowed   autoUpload false   loadImageMaxFileSize 3  1024   acceptFileTypes .gifjpegpngi   add e, data gt     console.log add callback triggered codepre  pThe add callback is triggered for EVERY file. Even if I try to implement my own solution to limit the number of uploaded files, I would like to be able to know when all the calls to add are complete. In other words, if I have to implement the solution, it would look like p  ol liWait for add event on for each file. Maintain a counter to count each file on the add callbackli liKnow when all add event triggering is complete for strongALLstrong files  HOWli liSee how many files were uploaded and prevent upload strongof all the filesstrong if they exceed the max number allowed and prompt for selecting a subset of files from initial selection to upload.li ol  pThe solution is purely client side for the images and the images directly upload to S3 but I need to prevent more than 3 uploads for each transaction. With the currently implementation I have, there is nothing that prevents the user from selecting hisher whole image folder and mess up the S3 bucket with ton of images. Amazon for its part will take as many files as are uploaded within the time the policy allows.p  pThe only way out of this imbroglio seems to be to route all uploads through the our servers which I am trying to desperately avoid due to scalabilityperformance issues. We are a very tiny startup with very minimal scaling capacity at this time. The other idea I have is to ask the server for a 30 second enabled policy for every file upload which seems rather cumbersome.p  pAny other ideasalternativessuggestionsrecommendations that people have triedused that workedp

Negative 10742 pIm using Scrapy to parse a website and then add these scraped informations to the wordpress blog. So after the scrapy script has parsed a website it sends all data in the json format to php script, which adds them to wordpress. The problem is that when this php script is called from Scrapy, it adds all data correctly EXCEPT assigning the post to the category. Somehow this doesnt work, although it adds the scraped categories to wordpress. It also doesnt automatically insert admin as a post author. There are just two blank fieldsin author and categories columns. p  pWhats interesting the php script adds all field correctly when its run directlynot as a call from Scrapy script. All data are correctly sended to php script.  You can see that clearly on screenshot below.

My code accepts a single type of request from a phone Android or iOS, and Im not writing that code and returns a hex string wrapped in basic HTML describing part of my server state.

Negative 10742 pI tried to implement doing some background calculation using an codeAsyncTaskLoadercode, just as I thought would be the right way to do it. Calculation is done in a different thread, the UI can stay smooth and buttery.p  pBut the opposite happend.p  pMy UI has some sliding panels. The user swipes them open, selects something in there and while the sliding panel slides back into place, the background task is performing its calculations for the main display that is again revealed while the sliding panel moves back.p  pNow when the background task is done and codeAsyncTaskLoader.loadInBackgroundcode is finished, the codeonLoadFinishedcode callback method of my fragment is triggered  it sets the adapter of the main contents to the new result and triggers codenotifyDataSetChangedcode of this adapter.p  pWhenever my background calculation is FAST, the sliding panel is not yet back in its retracted place and the update of the adapters data makes the panel movement hangp  pThus by using background tasks, I literally mess up my formerly smooth UI.p  pHow do you guys deal with things like thatp
Negative 10742 pHello i am trying to communicate between an avr atmega32a and a linux distro. I am using an ftdi chip on usb port VCOM drivers etcp  pI will post the codes in avr and linux but the code in avr works fine as i tested it on minicom.p  pI assume the problem here is my code on linux. The basic problem is that it sometimes works, sometimes does not work. I assume it has something to do with opening and closing of the file descriptor or the port itself.p  pWhy am i saying thisp  pThe code on avr does a simple thing. Waits for a button to get pressed and then starts sending Hello world forever.p  pSo when using minicom it works just fine.p  pWhen i use my program for the first time and wait for the button to gets pressed i dont seem to be able to read anything from the port even if i press the button.p  pThen i open minicom and it starts reading right away because button has been pressed. Then i close minicom, i open my program and it works fine....p  pIt seems to be having problems with opening and closing the file port but i am not sure. Anyways this thing is not stable enough.p  pAny help would be grateful.p  pWhat i want to write is to read continuously from the serial port.

In the past I solved this problem with a string separator end and I was able to split it and process it in a foreach loop.p  pIs that a good approach How would you solve that problem based on serialized object byte arrays Would you use a codebyte[]code delimiter or use another solutionp

My first thread did some work and upon finishing it would start the second thread. If the first thread got fired up again before the timerthread had finished it was supposed to kill the thread and restart it. This proved, for me, to be difficult to get the way I wanted. So I instead took another approach towards my wanted end result. Instead of restarting the thread I simply restarted the stopwatch that my second thread was using as a counter. This gave me the result I wanted. Its probably bad practice but it works. p

Negative 10742 pIm using SQL Server in a C application, and Im using batch statements. The problem Im having is in the case where the statement fails, for whatever reason, I need to know which statement failed and return it. p  pIve managed to do this my putting a codetry catchcode around the SQL statement so it wont quit if it fails then the C codecmd.ExecuteQuerycode returns the number of rows affected. p  pThe problem Im having now is that if the failure occurs because of a trigger, the trigger is outside of the codetry catchcode of the original batch and thus wont be caught, but it will instead be caught by the C application. At this point, the state of the batch is lost in limbo and the whole thing fails. p  pI need some way of knowing which statement or the number of rows affected so far, or the index in the batch triggered the trigger that caused the exception. Whether theres something I can do in SQL or C, Im open to whatever. p  pThanks.p

Negative 10742 pImagine a page that shows a newsfeed. As soon as a user request said page, we go to the database or whatever and get the newsfeed. After the page is already loaded, we also have new news items added dynamically through ajaxjson. This means we effectively have two mechanisms to build a newsfeed. One with our server side language for the initial page request, and one with Javascript for any new items.p  pThis is hard to maintain because when something changes, we have to change both the JS mechanism and the Server side mechanism. p  pWhat is a good solution for this And why Ive come up with the following scenariosp  ul liGiving javascript an intial set, somewhere in the html, and let it build the initial view when document is readyli liLetting javascript do an ajax request on document ready to get the initial data or li liKeep it as described above, having a JS version and a SS version.li ul  pIm leaning towards the first scenario, And for that I have a followup question How do you give JS the dataset in a hidden div or somethingp

If I only try to update a single item in my database by using a single field, then only that item gets update but all other items get deleted.p  pHere is my code.p  precode lth2gtDeal 1lth2gt     ltform methodPOST actiongt          lttablegt             lttrgt                 lttdgtltlabelgtTitle ltlabelgtltbrgtltinput typetext nametitle1 placeholderltphp echo htmlspecialcharsdeal1title gtgtlttdgt             lttrgt              lttrgt                 lttdgt                     ltlabelgtDescription ltlabelgtltbrgtlttextarea styleheight 200px namedesc1 placeholderltphp echo htmlspecialcharsdeal1desc gtgtlttextareagt                 lttdgt             lttrgt              lttrgt                 lttdgtltlabelgtPrice ltlabelgtltbrgtltinput typetext nameprice1 placeholderltphp echo htmlspecialcharsdeal1price gtgtlttdgt             lttrgt              lttrgt                 lttdgtltlabelgtInclude ltlabelgtltbrgtltinput typetext nameinclude1 placeholderltphp echo htmlspecialcharsdeal1inc gtgtlttdgt             lttrgt              lttrgt                 lttdgtltlabelgtNot Include ltlabelgtltbrgtltinput typetext namenotinc1 placeholderltphp echo htmlspecialcharsdeal1noinc gtgtlttdgt             lttrgt              lttrgt                 lttdgtltinput typesubmit namesubmit1 valueSavegtlttdgt             lttrgt          lttablegt      ltformgt codepre  pAnd here is the Connectionp  precodeltphp      connect mysqliconnectlocalhost, root, password, specials   Error Check      ifmysqliconnecterrnoconnect             echo failed to connect       fetcher  mysqliqueryconnect, SELECT  FROM specials WHERE id1      fetcher2  mysqliqueryconnect, SELECT  FROM specials WHERE id2      fetcher3  mysqliqueryconnect, SELECT  FROM specials WHERE id3      deal1  mysqlifetcharrayfetcher     deal2  mysqlifetcharrayfetcher2     deal3  mysqlifetcharrayfetcher3       Insert Data     mysqliqueryconnect, INSERT INTO deal1 title VALUES Galapagos     Deal 1     deal1titledeal1[title]     deal1descdeal1[description]     deal1pricedeal1[price]     deal1incdeal1[include]     deal1noincdeal1[notinclude] codepre  pHere is my db update formp  precode        lth2gtDeal 1lth2gt     ltform methodPOST actiongt          lttablegt             lttrgt                 lttdgtltlabelgtTitle ltlabelgtltbrgtltinput typetext nametitle1 placeholderltphp echo htmlspecialcharsdeal1title gtgtlttdgt             lttrgt              lttrgt                 lttdgt                     ltlabelgtDescription ltlabelgtltbrgtlttextarea styleheight 200px namedesc1 placeholderltphp echo htmlspecialcharsdeal1desc gtgtlttextareagt                 lttdgt             lttrgt              lttrgt                 lttdgtltlabelgtPrice ltlabelgtltbrgtltinput typetext nameprice1 placeholderltphp echo htmlspecialcharsdeal1price gtgtlttdgt             lttrgt              lttrgt                 lttdgtltlabelgtInclude ltlabelgtltbrgtltinput typetext nameinclude1 placeholderltphp echo htmlspecialcharsdeal1inc gtgtlttdgt             lttrgt              lttrgt                 lttdgtltlabelgtNot Include ltlabelgtltbrgtltinput typetext namenotinc1 placeholderltphp echo htmlspecialcharsdeal1noinc gtgtlttdgt             lttrgt              lttrgt                 lttdgtltinput typesubmit namesubmit1 valueSavegtlttdgt             lttrgt          lttablegt      ltformgt codepre  pAnd here is my db update php codep  precode ltphp      Get Data Deal 1      ifissetPOST[submit1]      getTitle1POST[title1]     getDesc1POST[desc1]     getPrice1POST[price1]     getInc1POST[include1]     getNoIncPOST[noinc1]         Set Title         ifemptygetTitle1         mysqliqueryconnect, UPDATE specials SET titlegetTitle1 WHERE id1                  Set Description         ifemptygetDesc1             mysqliqueryconnect, UPDATE specials SET descriptiongetDesc1 WHERE id1                      Set Price         ifemptygetPrice1         mysqliqueryconnect, UPDATE specials SET pricegetPrice1 WHERE id1                  Set Include         ifemptygetInc1             mysqliqueryconnect, UPDATE specials SET includegetInc1 WHERE id1                  Set noinclude         ifemptygetNoInc             mysqliqueryconnect, UPDATE specials set notincludegetNoInc WHERE id1                 codepre

Negative 10742 pIn Twig, the default delimiters for evaluating expressions is  ... .

Negative 10742 pIm using Apples XCode iOSSimulator to run tests of a strongbrowser applicationstrong on a virtual iPad device. To connect my code I use Appium. But sometimes the iOS simulator strongloses the safari.appstrong, so I cant run the tests without a browser on my device  its not only not displayed, its not there.

Its the same problem with all devices iPad and iPhone and alle software versions that are installed.p  pFirst I tried to emreset content and settingsem, but nothing happens.

Note that this is only if I do not changeset the Paint objects Alpha which I dont want to do  if I change alpha values of an image, I want them to be permanently changed for saving purposes, not only visually.p  pBasically, I have the followingp  precodeSet up of paint object paint  new PaintPaint.FILTERBITMAPFLAG  Paint.DITHERFLAG  Paint.ANTIALIASFLAG paint.setXfermodenew PorterDuffXfermodePorterDuff.Mode.MULTIPLY  Ive tried a couple of these DSTATOP and OVERLAY paint.setColor0x808fd2ea  Messed around with this too, just to see codepre  pHere is the loop I am currently using to just manually change the alpha of each pixel, currently alpha  120 50 transparencyp  precode    forint y  0 y lt bmp.getHeight y              int newPixelAlpha  alpha ltlt 24         for int x  0 x lt bmp.getWidth x                      bmp.setPixelx, y, bmp.getPixelx, y amp 0xFFFFFF  newPixelAlpha               codepre  pThen this is the method I use to draw each bitmap to the canvasp  precodepublic void drawSelfCanvas canvas, Paint paint      ifactive          if selected              paint.setAlphaopacity             canvas.drawBitmapbitmap, rect.left, rect.top, null         This bit here is just if someone longpresses on the image, it gets highlighted  but a rectangle over it, with transparency 170.          Not being used at this point          else              paint.setAlpha170             canvas.drawRectrect, paint             canvas.drawBitmapbitmap, rect.left, rect.top, paint                codepre  pThe following is a screenshot of one image atop another, with no transparency unfortunately, I need 10 reputation to include it in this postp  pa hrefhttptinypic.comrr0t4pt8 relnofollowhttptinypic.comrr0t4pt8ap  pWhereas here, I have edited the alpha value of each pixel of the top image using the loop above, yet it is still opaquep  pa hrefhttptinypic.comr2j2dras8 relnofollowhttptinypic.comr2j2dras8ap  pPerhaps it is actually seeing the canvas background colour as what is behind the image, rather than the other image This would explain why it only gets darker when I make it transparent. Im assuming that somehow I need to make canvas do some sort of perpixel blending or something of that nature Unfortunately my knowledge in this area is still quite limited, so I am unsure of what to trywhere to go to from here.p  pId really appreciate any guidance on this p  pThanksp

Negative 10742 pSomehow I messed up our master branch as well as the feature branch I used to mess up the master branch with. Now Im attempting to fix it but having trouble. For what its worth, I have identified the commit that I need to roll back to in both the master and feature branches, so I believe the original problem has been removed.p  pPROBLEM When I merge the feature branch in to master, it seems that automerge is removing some code in the feature branch and not merging it in to master. It doesnt give me the opportunity to resolve it as a merge conflict...it just simply doesnt move those pieces of code over in to master.p  pA HACK I found that if I went in to one of the affected scripts accountviews.py in the feature branch and removed a space or something it would then force me to resolve it as a conflict and I could then tell Git to keep the code I need it to keep. Certainly I could do that, I suppose, for all affected scripts, but Id rather not do a hack if there is a more elegant way to handle it using Git.p  pI have done a codegit diff featurebranchcode command and copied the results in to a text doc so I could pick through it to determine what all needs the above hack treatment, but its BIG.p  pIm not certain if there is any screenshottype of info that would help, so none is included. Please let me know of any helpful info needed and Ill provide it with an edit to this.p  pAny help would be much appreciated. p  h2UPDATE 1h2  pShows terminal commands during the merge process sitting on the master branch...this is what is showing after doing the hack on appsaccountviews.pyp  precodekedmistonahnew kedmiston git merge ftrrefer Automerging appsajaxviews.py CONFLICT content Merge conflict in appsajaxviews.py Automerging appsaccountviews.py CONFLICT content Merge conflict in appsaccountviews.py CONFLICT modifydelete appsaccounttemplatesaccountrefersuccess.html deleted in HEAD and modified in ftrrefer.

Negative 10742 pI had a site in the local windows system  made in cakephp. When I uploaded it to server linux environment the site works fine but some controllers are showing blank pages. The site works fine in local system though.p  pFor example, when I type a hrefhttpexample.comdashboard relnofollowhttpexample.comdashboarda it correctly redirects back to login page but when  I type a hrefhttpexample.comsettings relnofollowhttpexample.comsettingsa it shows only blank page. p  pI have tried clearing tmp folder caches, renaming the controller to something else like Books, changing debug level, but neither any error shows up nor the page loads correctly.

So error reporting is working fine.p  pIf I allow the controller action in the codebeforeFiltercode using codethisgtAuthgtallowcode the page loads up but the codes like codeAuthComponenetusernamecode return empty values. p  pSo the problem seems to be in the AuthComponenet which is successfully redirecting some pages to login and not redirecting some.

Negative 10742 pHow can I move an element from a C11 container to the back of the containerp  pIm specifically using a list but could use a vector if needed or probably any container would be good to get general container solutions.p  pI have a list of elements. I have a value. I pass this value to each element one of them will respond. The first one that responds I want to move to the back of the container.p  pMy existing code looks like thisp  precodestdlistltelementsgt melements ... bool handleevent e      forauto ampelement  melements              ifelementgthandle             return true          return false  codepre  pBut what I now want to do is move the element that codehandlecodes the event to the end of codemelementscode. For a bit of context, Im working on a GUI system of windows. So whichever window happens to capture the mouse needs to jump to the top when being drawn windows in codemelementscode are being drawn one by one so the last element is on top.p  pIt might be worth noting that elements are codestdsharedptrcodes.p  h2strongEDITstrongh2  pIn case anyone comes across this question and answer for a similar situation.p  pI actually needed to iterate backwards through my container to process input because the last element is drawn last, i.e. it is on top, so it should be the first element that should try to intercept input.p  pThis was simple to do. However, splicing a reverse iterator to the end of your container is a bit trickier. codestdreverseiterator.basecode returns you the NEXT iterator if the iterator was a forward iterator, so you need to codestdadvancecode the iterator by code1code in order to successfully move the actual element that intercepted.p  precodeforauto itr  melements.rbegin itr  melements.rend itr      ifitrgthandlee              auto itr2  itr.base         stdadvanceitr2,1         melements.splicemelements.end melements, itr2         return true       codepre  pHope this helps the next poor soul.p

Thus, according the the simple set, bf is the offspring of dd and he, dd of ga and ec, and the parents of ga are unknown.p  pThe idea behind this function is to determine the oldest animals in the dataset, i.e., the ones with the least number of generations, and eventually in succeeding code order them accordingly and generate a relationship matrix. So it is supposed to be OK if an animal does not appear in the sire list it means that it is an older animal. So the code is supposed to move on to the next. Which it does in the simple set, but not in the proper one. Any ideasp  pThanksp

I thus tried to remove the All from the choices, but that did not work. p  pAny help much appreciated Thanksp  pHeres a reproducible example p  pCreate sample data first p  precodeset.seed1 df lt data.frameFIRMrepLETTERS[17],each10, CATEG1rbinom70,4,0.9,CATEG2rbinom70,1,0.2,dateas.Date20140101110,y1sample1100,70 codepre  pShinyAppp  precodelibraryshiny libraryrCharts librarydoBy libraryplyr  shinyAppui   shinyUIpageWithSidebar   Application title headerPanelExample,             sidebarPanel          uiOutputfirm,           selectInputfirm, Filter by firm,             choices  uniqueas.characterdf,          selectInputcateg1, Filter by Category 1,                      choices  cAll,uniqueas.characterdfCATEG1,          selectInputdate, Filter by Date,                       choices  cAll,Last 28 Days,Last Quarter,          selectInputcateg2, Filter by Category 2,                       choices  cAll,uniqueas.characterdfCATEG2                 , sidebarPanel         mainPanel          h4Example plot,style  colorgrey,          showOutputplot, nvd3          mainPanel       sidebarLayout   shinyU  ,  server  shinyServerfunctioninput, output, session     subsetdata lt reactivedf lt filterdatadf,inputfirm,                                          inputdate,                                          inputcateg1,                                          inputcateg2                        shinyvalidateneedis.nulldf,No data to display                        returndf    outputfirm lt renderUI    selectInputfirm, Filter by Firm,             choices  cAll,as.characteruniquesubsetdataFIRM                  outputplotltrenderChart2 buildplotsubsetdata    below are the functions used in the code     function for date subsetting     filterdateltfunctiondf,dateRangeAll   filt lt df   td lt maxas.Datefiltdate   if dateRangeLast 28 Daysfilt ltfilt[filtdategttd28,]   if dateRangeLast Quarterfilt ltfilt[filtdategttd84,]   returnfilt       filter by date    function for data subsetting     filterdataltfunctiondf,firmNULL,dateRangeAll,categ1NULL,categ2NULL       filtltfilterdatedf,dateRange    if is.nullfirm    iffirmAll filt lt filt[filtFIRMfirm,]      if is.nullcateg1   if categ1All filt lt filt[filtCATEG1categ1,]       if is.nullcateg2    if categ2All filt lt filt[filtCATEG2categ2,]        ifnrowfilt0 filt lt NULL   returnfilt     prepare data to be plotted   function to create plot    buildplot lt functiondf    plotDataltdf    If 1 partner selected, time series is shown     if lengthas.characteruniqueplotDataFIRM1     tabledtaltsummaryByy1FIRMdate,dataplotData,FUNsum,keep.namesTRUE     filler  expand.gridFIRMas.characteruniquedfFIRM,                      dateseqmintabledtadate,maxtabledtadate,by1 day   df  mergefiller,            tabledta,            bycdate,FIRM,            all.xT   df[is.nadf]0   p lt nPloty1  date, group  FIRM, data  df, type  lineChart   pchartmarginlistleft150   pyAxisshowMaxMin  FALSE   pxAxistickFormat functiond return d3.time.formatYmdnew Dated  24  60  60  1000   p       If All partners are selected, barchart of Top 5 is shown   else   SummaryTabltaggregatey1FIRM,dataplotData,FUNsum   SummaryTabrankrankSummaryTaby1   SummaryTabrank[SummaryTabrankgt5]lt6    if lengthSummaryTabrankgt5    Top 5 partners in terms of y1 are shown   top5ltSummaryTab[SummaryTabranklt5,]    other partners are collapsed, shown as 1 entry    othersltaggregatey1rank,dataSummaryTab,FUNsum     othersltothers[othersrank6,]   othersFIRMltOthers     Create the summarytable to be plotted   plotDatarbindtop5,others    tabledtaltsummaryByy1FIRM,dataplotData,FUNsum,keep.namesTRUE    tabledtaltarrangetabledta,y1       ifis.nulltabledta printInput is an empty string    p lt nPloty1  FIRM,data  tabledta, type  multiBarHorizontalChart       pchartmarginlistleft150   pyAxisshowMaxMin  FALSE   p           shinyServer     codepre

Negative 10742 pI am just getting to grips with the basics of SpriteKit mainly as a learning exercise, but this might also become a game I release, and I am having issues trying to get the nodes involved to react to friction in the way Id expect. This is similar to a previous question which is so far unsolved a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions24246984howcaniapplyfrictiontoacircularskphysicsbodyHow can I apply friction to a circular SKPhysicsBodyap  pstrongMy current setup is as shown herestrongp  pa hrefhttpi.stack.imgur.com5r91X.png relnofollowhttpi.stack.imgur.com5r91X.pngap  pemPlease ignore the pokeball image as a sprite, Ill obviously change this before I release anythingemp  pWhen I rotate right strongemor clockwise as shown in step 1 of the imageemstrong, the ball behaves as Id expect, i.e. it will roll down the top edge of the blue rectangle and then around the edge of the red circle until it falls off. Ive set up the red circle to be the parent node of the blue rectangle, so the rotation is applied to both objects simultaneously.p  pWhere things come unstuck is the situation where youve used the blue rectangle to nudged the ball to the crest top of the red circle then stop rotating clockwise. At this point the ball will slowly start accelerating clockwise along the edge of the red circle.p  pMy expectation here is that if you immediately start rotating left strongemanticlockwise, as shown in step 2emstrong the fact that there is emor should be at leastem some friction between the ball and the red circle, would mean some amount of force is imparted on the ball to counteract its acceleration clockwise along the top edge of the red circle. This would allow you to mitigate the balls acceleration, keeping it in contact with the red circle as you rotate the entire thing around.p  pThe reason I want it to behave in this way is that I plan to add obstacles around the inside edge of the larger black circle which would result in a game over condition, and the winning condition would be a target zone on the opposite side of the blue rectangle from where the ball starts. Without friction interactions as I expect, the game would become impossible as you wouldnt be able to keep the ball in contact with the red circle as you rotate the puzzle scene.p  pN.B Before you all suggest, I have tried setting the friction properties of all of the nodes physicsBody properties to 1.0, which I believe is the max value, and this does not change the behaviour at all. Also the ball sprite is configured to allow rotation, which is also obviously needed I think.p

to Bart Hofma, I realised that I probably made it confusing about my app crashing. My app doesnt crash when GA tries to dispatch events. On the contrary, GA tries to dispatch events only when my app crashes, otherwise it stays silent. And I crash my app deliberately to see what GA might say. I have a custom video player that works fine on real devices but crashes on VMs, so when I want my app to crash, I just go to the player Activity on a VM.p

In the wsdl Ive created an array object items like thisp  precodeltscomplexType nameitemsgt          ltssequencegt              ltselement nillabletrue nameitem typetnsitem minOccurs0 maxOccursunboundedgt          ltssequencegt       ltscomplexTypegt  codepre  pThe php function is just a simple class method passed to the php soapserver like thisp  precodeltphp class Test       public function addItemsitems           printritems        service  new Test server  new SoapServerwsdl.xml servergtsetObject printservergthandle   codepre  pThe problem it the way php soapserver handles the array. When I add just one item the items list isnt returned as an array. When i add two items the array of items is stored in a an item element instead of the expected items argument.p  pI tried using soapencarray, but that seems incompatible with WSI compliance as mentioned in a hrefhttpwww.wsi.orgProfilesBasicProfile1.020040416.htmlrefinement16556272 relnofollowhttpwww.wsi.orgProfilesBasicProfile1.020040416.htmlrefinement16556272a and also it fails when I want the add the service to visual studio when I use this type of encoding.p  pSo what Im doing wrong I think i have to change the wsdl somewhere but couldnt find a working example.

Negative 10742 pI am using the following code upon startup to compile my workbook to prevent any ActiveX related errorsp  precodePrivate Sub ThisWorkbookOpen     Set compileMe  objVBECommandBar.FindControlTypemsoControlButton, ID578      compileMe.Execute End Sub codepre  pThis code automates the command bar in VBE and works great in an unprotected workbook. When I lock the VBE password protect the debugcompile option becomes disabled and this results in the above code running into an error.p  pIs there any workaround this For example, unprotect VBE then run the above code and protect it again all from the same workbook I understand this wont be a basic task as AFAIK there is no API for this but is there any solution to this preferably for stability purposes a one which doesnt use send keysp  pstrongEDITstrong Apologies for the confusion with question duplication. The question you have linked to be a duplicate explains how to unlock VBE in a different workbook in another instance of excel, this is no problem as it works fine however, requires an additional excel file to act as an unlocker file as opening the same file in another instance opens it as read only.p  pWhat I am trying to do is have the same workbook unlock itself, the problem with this is that as soon as the window opens asking for the password the code stops at that point. The reason for this is that it is opening the window as a Modal window therefore, requiring some form of user input to continue hide or unload the window. So really, I was just wondering if there is any other way around this or if I am over complicating things.p

Negative 10742 pWorking on an ASP.Net Application using Forms Authentication.p  pThe device I must use is a Windows Mobile 6.5 Classic with IE6 Mobile.  I am trying to get Forms Authentication to work, and it seems like the cookies are immediately expiring on the device.  The browser settings are currently allowing cookies.p  pWhen I try on an Android using Chrome browser, the cookie remains, and when I run it on the desktop it remains as well.  Even running IE6 on a desktop emulator works fine.p  pSo Ive concluded that it is the IE6 Mobile browser or the Windows Mobile 6.5 Classic device because I can reproduce the problem on both the device and in an emulator.p  pI have looked at MobileFormsAuthentication class, but that looks to be obsolete.  I implemented it, but it also did not solve my issue.p  pHas anybody come across a solution for this  p  pCheersp

Negative 10742 pIm currently working on a data visualizing GUI using GUIDE and Id like to be able to plot N plots and link all their axes. However, I have a feature that plots the values of parameters against each other, then I have a plot that does standard value vs. time of the same parameters. In transitioning from the value vs value plots to the time vs value, I cannot link the plots due to the extreme xlim of the time axis.

Negative 10742 pI am pretty new to PHP, coming from ASP, and am having a hard time understanding exactly how error handling works with PHP and PDO.  Here is what I have going on...p  pPDO is set with  p  precodePDOATTRERRMODE gt PDOERRMODEEXCEPTION codepre  pI am making an AJAX call to a PHP page to process some data and save it to MySQL using PDO.  I have my DB scripts in a try catch like sop  precodefunction processStuff     try         sth  dbgtprepare query         sthgtexecute      catch PDOEXCEPTION e         log error           if no error     return arraysome json  codepre  plets say something bad happens and I get an error likep  precodeError exception PDOException with message SQLSTATE[23000] Integrity constraint violation 1048 Column field cannot be null in Cfilepath202 codepre  pWhat is happening is that the error is halting the script, thereby causing the calling page to just hang.  The AJAX is waiting for a JSON reponse that will tell whether it succeeded or failed.  But because it is hanging, it doesnt get the response, so I dont have the opportunity to show the user there was an error.p  pI also have a custom error handler functionp  precodefunction errorHandlererrno, errstr, errfile, errline      log errors   seterrorhandlererrorHandler codepre  pthat can log errors.  But, due to my newbieness, I am not sure how to use that in the trycatch.p  pSo my question is, how do I log an error when a PDO exception occurs and make sure that the script continues processing so that the calling page with the AJAX doesnt hang.p  pAll the other answers around similar questions assume a level of knowledge that I dont seem to have yet.  I am not clear if I am supposed to throw an error to be caught, or if it is automatically being thrown.  If PDO is automatically throwing it, how do I call my error handler in the catch  would I just usep  precodeerrorHandler codepre  pAnd if I switched to ERRMODESILENT, which I believe would continue the processing, how do I detect the error in order to throw it to the catchp  pI am sure there are some basic concepts that I am just not understanding about how this works. Code is great, but any explanation is greatly appreciated.p  pThanks.p  pUPDATE Here is the actual try blockp  precode        try              sth  dbhgtprepare INSERT INTO emailvalidation email, valcode VALUES a1, a2             sthgtbindParam a1, email             sthgtbindParam a2, gencode             sthgtexecute           catch PDOEXCEPTION e              err  true             errmsg  dateF j, Y, gi a . n . ERRURL . n . e . nn             errorlogerrmsg,3,ERRLOGPATHINT          codepre  pThe AJAX looks like thisp  precode    .postFunctionsAJAXnewaccount.php, form.serialize, functiondata          var c  data.check         ifc1             process client side stuff here         else             Ooops there was an error             show error to client                  return false     ,json codepre  pI guess the JSON is getting written, but I am not understanding why I am not appearing to get to else in my AJAX and the page appears to be stalled.p  pANOTHER UPDATE  so I just tried p  precodetriggererrorblah blah codepre  pin the catch block and it stopped hanging.  The errorHandler seems to have processed the error correctly, although my AJAX processed it incorrectly, but it did stop hanging.  Is this a correct way to handle this, or is there a better wayp

Negative 10742 pI am trying to deploy my war using tomcat implement in java before running my functional test. Initially I implemented Jetty Server in java and I successfully exposed the URI and I could execute my test. But I want to deploy my war to test it and not just expose the URI,I can obviously use jetty plugin and cargo in my pom file, but I want to use tomcat to do so. I thoroughly searched online, I found sample code on deploying war using tomcat implementation in java [1], so that I can start tomcat, deploy my war and then run my functional test. But it is not clearly explained. Can I refer to any good documentation online which will help me with deploying my war using tomcatp  p[1] a hrefhttpwww.programcreek.comjavaapiexamplesindex.phpapiorg.apache.catalina.startup.Tomcat relnofollowhttpwww.programcreek.comjavaapiexamplesindex.phpapiorg.apache.catalina.startup.Tomcatap

Negative 10742 pI have created a user interface that has a working drag and copy in javascript. My problem is the div getting copied has a hidden div that i need to swap once they reach the dropzone.

I have posted a link to a Google Doc that has an example of the data in its current format followed by how I need it to be formatted. Currently, all data for a given person is in a single row, and the ID  is repeated before each record, as shown. Each record consists of 12 columns, and this is repeated 31 times across a row, totaling 372 cells per row. There are 838 rows or 837 without the headers.  I need either a set of formulas or a macro that will separate a single row of data the 372 cells into 31 rows of 12 columns for an entire spreadsheet. I have been able to accomplish this only with a single row using the codeoffsetcode function and then again using codeindexcode, but I am struggling to find a way to make it apply to every row on a worksheet. Once that first row is done, the formula goes no further. Ideally, the rearranged data will appear on a strongnewstrong worksheet. I cant just manually separate the rows and filter them by ID , because then I would have to redo that every time I rerun the report. Please let me know if I can give any further clarificationp

Negative 10742 pI created a custom tooltip with style defined in .xaml files loaded on application startup or when the user changes application theme. Because the tooltip is used by multiple controls with only slight differences for each of them, I decided to create a separate resource dictionary file with all style definitions that are common to all controls that use the tooltip. On the other hand, I put all controlspecific styles to separate resource dictionary files. Those files use a merged dictionary with a reference to the file with the common styles I mentioned.p  pThe base file contains multiple style definitions, and at least one of them has a style trigger defined. The trigger shows drop shadow when a dependency property HasDropShadow of the tooltip is set to true. The style is extended in the controlspecific files using the BasedOn attribute.p  pFor some reason, when I run the app on Windows Server 2012, the drop shadow is not visible. On the other hand, when I run the app on Windows 7, the drop shadow is visible as expected. Is something wrong with the way I declared the binding or does Windows affect the tooltips HasDropShadow property in any wayp  pPlease note that when I set the Effect property directly, without using triggers, the drop shadow is always visible, even on Windows 2012.p  pDo you have an idea what could cause this behaviour p  pHere is the base StyleBaseUserToolTip.xaml file I removed unrelated content from itp  precodeltResourceDictionary xmlnshttpschemas.microsoft.comwinfx2006xamlpresentation         xmlnsxhttpschemas.microsoft.comwinfx2006xaml         xmlnsClientclrnamespaceClientassemblyClientgt      ltStyle xKeyToolTipBorderBase TargetTypeBordergt         ltSetter PropertyPadding Value10,10,10,10 gt         ltSetter PropertyBorderThickness Value0 gt          ltSetter PropertyBackgroundgt             ltSetter.Valuegt                 ltImageBrush ImageSourceImagesUserToolTipbackgroundbar.png gt             ltSetter.Valuegt         ltSettergt          ltdrop shadow visibilitygt         ltStyle.Triggersgt             ltDataTrigger BindingBinding RelativeSourceRelativeSource AncestorTypeClientUserToolTip, PathHasDropShadow ValueTruegt                 ltSetter PropertyEffectgt                     ltSetter.Valuegt                         ltDropShadowEffect BlurRadius5 Opacity0.4gt                     ltSetter.Valuegt                 ltSettergt             ltDataTriggergt         ltStyle.Triggersgt     ltStylegt      ltStyle xKeyToolTipContent TargetTypeClientUserToolTipgt         ltSetter PropertyToolTipService.Placement ValueLeft gt         ltSetter PropertyStaysOpen ValueTrue gt          ltSetter PropertyTemplategt             ltSetter.Valuegt                 ltControlTemplate TargetTypexType ClientUserToolTipgt                      ltBorder StyleDynamicResource ToolTipBordergt                         ltStackPanel StyleStaticResource ToolTipContentContainergt                             ...                         ltStackPanelgt                     ltBordergt                  ltControlTemplategt             ltSetter.Valuegt         ltSettergt     ltStylegt ltResourceDictionarygt codepre  pAnd here is one of the controlspecific filesp  precodeltResourceDictionary xmlnshttpschemas.microsoft.comwinfx2006xamlpresentation     xmlnsxhttpschemas.microsoft.comwinfx2006xaml     xmlnsClientclrnamespaceClientassemblyClientgt      ltResourceDictionary.MergedDictionariesgt          ltResourceDictionary SourceStyleBaseUserToolTip.xaml gt          ltResourceDictionarygt             ltStyle xKeyToolTipBorder TargetTypeBorder BasedOnStaticResource ToolTipBorderBasegt                 ltSetter PropertyMargin Value2,0,8,8 gt             ltStylegt         ltResourceDictionarygt      ltResourceDictionary.MergedDictionariesgt ltResourceDictionarygt codepre  pThank youp
Negative 10742 pI should clarify up front My question is about closures and client module patterns in Javascript. Its not about how to use jQuery.noConflict.p  pIve got a bit of Javascript that people can add to their websites. I want my own code to have access to a  variable which resolves to a specific version of jQuery thats independent of whatever the page has loaded. This is easy if all my code is in a single file, inside a closure that I define. But Im struggling to find a clean way to do this using a module pattern where my code is in separate closures.p  pstrongBackgroundstrong i.e. the obvious thing which strongisntstrong the problemp  pThis was easy when all my code was in one file. I could just create a  var within my outermost closure and use .noConflict... to make sure the outer page kept its own jQuery version. Something like thisp  precode This is easy and works as youd expect function       var   The  var in my local scope that the rest of my code can use.      function loadMyVersionOfjQuery          insertTheAppropriateScriptTagAndWaitForTheScriptToLoadfunction               Set the  in my local scope and restore the global jQuery.               jQuery.noConflicttrue                    loadMyVersionOfjQuery      ... etc. ...  codepre  pNow Im in the process of breaking my code up into separate files using browserify and this is no longer so easy. The most trouble comes from the fact that my version of jQuery is loaded asynchronously. So at the time my module requires are being processed my version of jQuery isnt ready. This prevents me from simply creating and assigning a  var at the top level of my module closures.p  pstrongSome ideas Ive looked intostrongp  ol liIf I could defer the initialization of my modules until after jQuery is run, then each of my modules could define their own  var. But this doesnt seem possible. It looks like my requires... calls are aggressively traversed even if I try to hide them inside function callbacks browserify seems to actually parse the JS to find the require statements.li liIf I could define a dynamic proxy object, I could initialize my own  vars with a proxy that would later delegate to my loaded version of jQuery. But Javascript doesnt support the dynamic proxy pattern.li liBrowserify actually defines a closure that wraps all of my modules when theyre transpiled to a single file. If I could somehow give it a snippet of code to insert into this closure simply var , Id be in business. But I havent found any way to do this.li liAs a last resort, it occurred to me that I could create my own closure around the browserify output and define the scoped variable I need there. By either processing the output file or by doing a hacky concatenation of a couple simple files around the browserify content something like functionvar   bundle.js  . But this is just too hacky.li ol  pDoes anyone have any ideas How do you develop client Javascript modules in multiple files but still get a closure for all your code togetherp

Negative 10742 pIm new to polymer and Im trying to integrate D3 with it. I modified an existing Gist but Im a bit stumped.  Im trying to pass some JSON from Polymer element attribute codebarDatacode in HTML to the polymer template. The JSON is being passed as a codeStringcode and parsed into a computed property codedatacode. Ive placed some default values into the codebarDatacode property but want these overwritten each time a new element is created, with the codebarDatacode attribute. This does not work. I created another attribute called codetestcode that just passes a string to a test property that is displayed in a paragraph.

Negative 10742 pWere looking to begin using S3 for some of our storage needs and Im looking for a way to perform a batch upload of N files. Ive already written code using the Java API to perform single file uploads, but is there a way to provide a list of files to pass to an S3 bucketp  pI did look at the following question a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions15050146isitpossibletoperformabatchuploadtoamazons3isitpossibletoperformabatchuploadtoamazons3a, but it is from two years ago and Im curious if the situation has changed at all. I cant seem to find a way to do this in code.p  pWhat wed like to do is to be able to set up an internal job probably using scheduled tasking in Spring to transition groups of files every night. Id like to have a way to do this rather than just looping over them and doing a put request for each one, or having to zip batches up to place on S3.p

Negative 10742 pMy goal is to use a simple form that can be accessed on a smart phone or tablet to enter my customers booking information, that form populates a row on a sheet. I have a trigger to run the script on form submit so in turn the sheet creates calendar events. If I need to change dates or information for the appointment I change it directly on the sheet and manually run the script to update the calendar. p  pThanks to the previous posts on this forum I was able to get a script working that does all of this. I take no credit for this code its been posted a few different places before. p  pIt worked great for the 1st part of my season, but as time went on and my schedule got full I started to have multiple errors. I had about 500 rows appointments. First I had errors that the script was invoked too many times in a short amount of time. I read about putting in a utilities.sleep but honestly I dont know how to implement this. I put it in the code in a few places set to 500 and it seemed to help. Then I had errors that there was too many changes being made to the calendar in a short amount of time. Then finally I had errors that the script was being invoked too many times in one day. p  pBy the end of the season I had to disable the trigger, only run the script manually 1 or 2 times a day, and constantly remove old rows appointments so there were only a few new appointments to get the script to work.p  pId like to understand how to properly implement the utilities.sleep function, where do I put it in the code and what should it be set top  pAlso Id like to know if there is something I can do to avoid the script being invoked too many times in one day. In general Im wondering if there is a better way to do this considering I want to have about 1000 lines of appointments. p  pHere is the code Im usingp  precode function onOpen    var sheet  SpreadsheetApp.getActiveSpreadsheet   var entries  [   name  Export Events,   functionName  exportEvents   ]   sheet.addMenuCalendar Actions, entries     function exportEvents    var sheet  SpreadsheetApp.getActiveSheet   var headerRows  1   Number of rows of header info to skip   var range  sheet.getDataRange   var data  range.getValues   var calId  mycalendarID   var cal  CalendarApp.getCalendarByIdcalId   for i0 iltdata.length i    if i lt headerRows continue    var row  data[i]    var date  new Daterow[1]    var title  row[4]    var tstart  new Daterow[2]    tstart.setDatedate.getDate    tstart.setMonthdate.getMonth    tstart.setYeardate.getYear    var tstop  new Daterow[3]    tstop.setDatedate.getDate    tstop.setMonthdate.getMonth    tstop.setYeardate.getYear    var loc  row[5]    var desc  row[6]    var id  row[12]   try    var event  cal.getEventSeriesByIdid   event.deleteEventSeries   row[12]     Remove event ID         catch e      var newEvent  cal.createEventtitle, tstart, tstop, descriptiondesc,locationloc.getId row[12]  newEvent   Update the data array with event ID debugger    range.setValuesdata  codepre

Negative 10742 p[SOLVED]p  pIm sorry if this is a bit off topic for Stack Overflow but I have asked this in a number of other places with no response...Anyway, I have a simple space shooting game and I am currently working on a page where the player selects a ship and a difficulty. I have animations on some of the buttons and most are working fine. However, on the difficulty buttons, once clicked, they either flash on and off its meant to be a faint flashing not an on and off or they just completely disappear.
